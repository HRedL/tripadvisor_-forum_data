I had just read this article this morning and wanted to see if anyone has any clarity on this. I couldn’t find any information on the embassy/government website...https:/…44921-rules-entering-croatia
"So, now we (from USA) have to bring a negative test OR self-quarantine? Is that correct?"
"Ekimistello, We are in the exact situation. When we saw the July 1 regulations, we began our trip planning. Have flight, hotels, car, excursion, etc. We leave in 6 days...supposedly. Filled out Enter Croatia form and received the approval email. And now THIS. I emailed uzg.covid@mup.hr to try to get some answers. I dont know what to do at this point. Keep me posted if you hear anything new. I will do the same. Rich"
"This is highly discouraging after the initial requirements were announced. Portugal did the same thing - announced USA was okay to enter without testing/isolation, and then changed the policy afterwards. I understand the reasons, however, they have to know that millions of people outside of EU probably booked trips after the July 1 regulations were announced."
"Just yesterday, we changed our airline tickets to go to Croatia for 15 nights (14 days) and then go to Italy. Thankfully we did not pay a change fee because the tickets had been affected by cancelled flights. Croatia has been on our bucket list for awhile. Our current departure date is Aug 13. But I think we will stop hoping because I expect things may become even more strict by then due to the increasing numbers here in the US."
"Rich--let me know if you get any response. I reached out to the US embassy and got a blanket automated response that has the updated information as of July 1st.Its very confusing because we filled out the forms required and received an email with this information from the Croatian Government Portal that specifically states “No Isolation Necessary” and “ Prior testing for COVID-19 is not required to enter the Republic of Croatia”. Not sure what would happen if we show up without a test and opt for the ""14 day isolation"". Granted, we did rent an entire home so we technically could abide by the isolation to some extent however we are only in Croatia for 11 days in total. No clue what we are going to do.Possibly cancel all together, Possibly get a Covid-19 test a few days before we depart and bank on receiving the results in time OR while we are in transit?"
"I do have some sympathy with those from the US who have trips booked but at the same time it always looked like a pretty crazy move from the Croatian authorities to allow tourists in from a country where the virus is clearly running out of control.After all, Croatia is a small country which will struggle to deal with a significant increase in infections.Edited: 1:00 pm, July 11, 2020 "
"I hear you, man. It’s not right. Do you have any idea: for those flying, is is a test taken 48 before getting on plane OR landing? Coming from USA, that’s basically a day difference which means a lot. Border patrol isn’t being clear with me."
"Dean, I get it. As an American, I was surprised that they allowed travel from here. But the fact remains that they DID, and are now going back on it after everything is booked. Selfishly, I admit, it ain’t right. I don’t mind getting tested either (I already have and am negative), but 48 hours before is impossible. Results don’t come back that quickly. They’ve essentially banned all travel from USA due to the 48 hour rule because we cannot get results that fast."
"Yes Ekimostello, I will keep you posted.So far, is the response from border patrol:Dear /sir less than 48 hours must pass from taking a throat and nose swab to reaching the border. With respect Border police (12)It doesn’t matter that we have already been “approved” and followed their previous requirements. What matters now is a test 48 hours before. Is is before taking off or landing, I have no idea."
"Thanks for info, did they say you have to upload the negative result to any online portal? Or just show up with a print out of a negative test?Also, it looks like you have the option to enter with no test you would just have to self isolate."

"No, just that a negative test must be taken. Not sure when or who it’s presented to. What a mess. I would not/could not isolate for 14 days there. For me, it’s a test or nothing."
Hey RiE!Hope all is well with you. Are you sure about that? The response I got from border patrol said 48 from TAKING the test. My flight is Friday and 18:00. Land in Croatia Saturday 12:00.
"This section of the announcement isn't clear, who does the part starting 'Even if' apply to? Is it just those who need to self isolate for 14 days or does it include those who have had a test?Passengers arriving in Croatia for tourism, other business or education are allowed to enter Croatia, but either need to show a negative PCR test, not older than 48 hours, or need to self-isolate for 14 days. Even if they're not given the formal measure of self-isolation, passengers from the third countries are instructed to stay put, leave their accommodation as little as possible, wear masks and avoid public transportation."
"Thank you, RiE! I will wait until Monday. I appreciate it."
From another BP Agent this morning: Dear /sir less than 48 hours should pass from taking a throat and nose swab to arriving in Croatia. With respect Border police (12)

"Yes, thank you RiE. I appreciate it. In reality, I can get a “rapid test” with 15 min results on Thursday and still fly on Friday. That’s what I’m working on now."
"US Embassy site confirms the results must be from a PCR test “not older than 48 hours (starting from the time of taking the swab until arrival at the border crossing). That effectively shuts us out. I cannot find a local resource for a PCR test with a 24-hour turnaround. https:/…Good luck, Rich. I hope it works out for you."
"Rich, keep me posted on how everything works out! We're New Yorkers as well and planning to go in August. Where can you get the rapid test in the city?"
"Check out Kamin Health. There’s four around NYC. They def do it. 17 mins. However, many conflicting reports as to if these rapid tests will be accepted by border patrol. They are FDA approved, but apparently many foreign govts are not recognizing them yet."
"Any word if we can be “released” from 14 day quarantine when negative PCR test results arrive via email?If so, how would we do that?"

"Hey RiE, Thank you for the detailed explanation. It clears up a lot. I have a few follow up questions, if you dont mind:1) You say ""fast tests"" are accepted. Usually, the ""fast tests"" in America (with results in 15 mins) are NOT PCR tests. Are these accepted?2) Can we be ""released"" from 14 day quarantine once results come in? If so, how?3) This is my plan. Please tell me if you think it is acceptable. My flight is on Friday and I land in Zagreb on Saturday, going through Paris. I am getting a Rapid Non-PCR test the day before I depart NY. I will have these results. (Also, I am negative, I took one today to make sure).I am also taking a PCR test the day before I fly. I will not have the results before I depart NY. Upon landing in Zagreb on Saturday at 12:00, I will present my NON-PCR test. If this is not accepted (and it probably wont be), I will tell border patrol I choose to self-isolate until my negative test results come in, which will hopefully be by Sunday. I will then follow steps (when I find out what they are) to release myself from quarantine. Does this seem acceptable?"
"maybe someone knows this but normally the boarding airline (In this case in the US) would not board a passenger that does not have the proper documents for entry to the country to which they are flying. In fact if they do they can be fined and have to fly that person back home. I believe this is what is being said in @34 above ""He has pointed out that the main problem could be an airline and not the border police in the country of your arrival. In other words, you will have to have a hard copy of your test with you,"" Rich I get that you want to go but boarding without the proper test in hand could present many problems (especially with so many transit points).Edited: 2:15 pm, July 13, 2020 "
another factor is that most reliable test centers in New York City are back up for 5-7 days for results and that includes Kamin Health. I have a friend that wants to travel and needs this and was told that just today.
"Hey Gene, I get that, HOWEVER, there are technically two options for entering CR. 1) negative test2) 14-day quarantine. I can CHOOSE 14 day quarantine."
"Gene, Trust me, I would NOT be doing all of this if I hadnt booked everything when CR said I was free to come. They then went back on that. I either try my hardest to get this done or risk losing thousands on paid accommodations, airfare, and car rental."
How long are you planning on staying...believe me I get the jerking around on rules but that is the nature of this whole Covid 19....one thing one day and next day they change...none of this is good for planning. If you are staying much longer than 14 days I guess you could agree to the 14 day quarantine. Without the test not sure it would be a very relaxing vacation but you will decide what it good for you. Not sure why @34 post was removed...it had good info.
16 days
"Hey RiE, Any reason why that post was removed?"

"RiEugen: please don’t do that. Your posts help people. The other person is as useless as the troll on the Italy and other boards who goes by multiple usernames. Please try to ignore that person and keep up your valuable posting for the benefit of us who sincerely appreciate it. Thank you. Best, pnaj"
"I agree! RiEugen is the most helpful native Croatian advisor with positive motivation here. But, I suppose, he is tired from fact that for those trolls there are given full freedom to write whatsoever they want."
"Rich, please keep us updated with how your travels go. I'm hoping to go to Croatia in August and am willing to self-quarantine. Not sure what the airlines will require.."
Coco: Keep an eye on this Croatian gov’t site for the latest on their requirements: https://mup.gov.hr/uzg-covid/english/286212The kicker for a quarantine-free stay is to obtain a negative PCR test not older than 48 hours from the time you arrive in Croatia. And this page: https:/…45002-pcr-testAnd of course we are hoping to hear back from Rich regarding his upcoming travels.
"Thank you Pnaj, great article! I'm curious, if I am unable to get a PCR test at all, if they will let us in and self quarantine. I guess come August the rules might be totally different so I'll keep an eye out!"
"My travel experience. (I am a US citizen traveling for tourist purposes).Departing from JFK: The gate agent at JFK did not know entry regulations and was attempting to deny all US tourists entry onto the plane, until I showed her the “rules” on embassy site. She kept saying “it’s up to my boss”, and finally “boss” came and said we were all okay to board. I suggest educating yourself on entry regulations in case you get someone who does not know. Plane was 75% empty. We each had our own row to lay down in like a bed. Delta definitely respecting social distancing protocols. Felt very safe. Arriving in and departing from CDG: Not one person even spoke to us upon arrival or departure from Paris. Transiting through there was as easy as could be. Health Declaration was not asked for. Plane packed. AirFrance not respecting social distancing protocols. They made us wear their masks, not our own - and they were sh**ty. I explained mine was better but they didn’t care. Had to be theirs. Arriving in Zagreb: Border Patrol agent first asked where I was staying. I said “numerous places, road trip, etc.”, he said “I just need the first one”. I showed him Booking confirmation on my phone. He then said “you know you have to quarantine?” I told him that I had negative test results. Showed him. He took them away, with passports (I assume to make copies). He came back and said “enjoy Croatia”. That’s it. Couldn’t have been more simple. Advice:1. know the entry regulations 2. have test (if possible)3. have an accommodationGood luck everyone!"
"Thank you, Rich! Have a great time!"
"Hi, I notice that you had planned to travel on to Italy. You are a US citizen? Under current travel bans, would that have been allowed? As in, even though Croatia has somewhat made travel from the US viable, would you then be allowed to travel to another EU country that is not currently allowing entry? I'm curious as to how this is all playing out, county to country."
"So Rich, did they accept the rapid (Non-PCR) test? Or by magic did the PCR results come in within 48 hours"
"I am a US citizen who is also very interested in visiting Croatia and then entering Italy. There seems to be conflicting information as to whether or not a US citizen can spend a minimum of 14 days in Croatia (or any ""safe"" country) and then enter Italy. Does anyone know?"
@reduxz - #52 and #53 - Rich replied in #49. He got into Croatia no problem.
"reneet: this is the page to rely on regarding admittance to Italy esteri.it/mae/en/ministero/normativaonline/d…Because the information is not clear cut I’ve given up on the idea of going to Italy after staying in Croatia x 15 nights.PS I emailed the Italian Consulate in Los Angeles but have not heard back. I could call but just decided to let it go.Edited: 8:56 pm, July 29, 2020 "
"And where to get the PCR test in Zagreb, Zadar, Split, Dubrovnik and Pula? I think these city locations are enough to get the testing services withing 48 hours from entry or leaving time. And can anyone tell me the average prices, too?"
i have to wonder how many from US actually put together flights that did not get cancelled and testing protocol to be able to enter and freely go about what they want to do on vacation? I am not seeing many reports...I think most gave up as it seems way too much effort and risk. Maybe I am wrong?
"@pnaj, #56. Thanks for the update. I am still researching ways to get to Italy! Good luck with any future travel plans you have this year. :)"
"Rich, did you have only the rapid test results or the PCE swap?"
