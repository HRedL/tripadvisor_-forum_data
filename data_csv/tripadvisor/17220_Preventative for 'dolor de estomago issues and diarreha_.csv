"It seems like every year, my girlfriend gets 'something' stomach related on this trip.I hesitate to call this Montezumas Revenge....I know issues can arise from a multitude of reasons, flying in a tube with a bunch of germs, too much sun, eating different (great) food, partying too much...etc. basically, our life is turned upside down for 3 weeks while we're not freezing our a$$es off up here for a change. I've read many forum posts about getting sick from food, drinking water, etc., and I do not believe this is happening to us from bad food or bad water in PV. Heck, we love the food, and the fresh choices, and we cook quite a bit at home also. We are religious about Microdining vegies and everything - even limes. I think our problems come from the combinations of environment change, intestinal bacteria and living large.So my question is - do you have any preventative measures to take and what are they? More probiotics? Do any of you guys with this kind of issue go to the pharmacy right away while in PV to get ahead of this?"
"I have always gone with the probiotic route, which I take about 2 weeks prior to Mexico and then while I am there - and I have seldom had a problem. I am also really diligent about hand washing/using sanitizer. I have only had a few mild tummy upsets. My spouse doesn't do anything preventive - and is always fine. I think some folks are just more sensitive to food/water changes and all you can do is try the best you can. Good luck! :)"
"Same here. Probiotics and wash hands. I don't take probiotics while down there, because mine are in the fridge. I take them everyday at home because it is healthy. But you can get probiotics that do not have to be refrigerated. Yes, some people have more sensitive stomachs than others. We always take Immodium D and Pepto Bismol along with us on every trip."
"We used to take Dukoral before going but haven't bothered lately, and no issues to report. Not sure if that is the same name in the States."
Just came back from a 3 week vacation no issues.We take Acidophoulus daily all year.
"Tried Dukoral when it first came out, used it for 3 years, did help me.But met someone down here who said they took a single pepto pill everyday for 3 days before coming & then you need to find your Maint level. For him it was still 1 tab a day but for me 1 tab was too much & I had to cut back to half a tab every morning for a week then stop & see how it goes. This worked very well for me for 4 years then suddenly I didn't need them anymore ?Good luck."
Try taking grapefruit seed extract from the minute you are in Mexico. Works on giardia and many other things. The liquid is awful so get the capsules. You can get it at a US healthfood store.
I don't usually have stomach issues but have always heard that eating a cup of yogurt each day for a week or ten days before traveling builds a bit of an immunity. Something to do with the bacteria in it?Don't know how true it is but does not hurt to try
Pepto tabs are quite good. A couple a day is good.
"I never get what I would call ""sick"" in Mexico, but periodically some weird things come up for a very short period of time. Such as this past Friday, I was supposed to meet up with a friend in PV and had a 2-hour lower GI thing so couldn't get on a bus for awhile. It cleared in 2 hours. All was well after that. The only incident in my 17-day trip.You said ""every year"" your girlfriend gets something stomach related. Stomach or lower GI? If it's truly ""every year,"" your girlfriend probably should see a doctor. Obviously the food and water in PV are pure and healthy, so there must be something else going on.Like others, I eat a lot of yogurt (and used to take acidophilus tabs before and during travel to Mexico, for yearsl) and drink a lot of bottled water. For temporary upsets, some of the above info helps but.....seriously....if it happens every year? Something to look into, ahead of time.Have a good trip but it might be worth analyzing why it happens every year. If it's a pattern, it probably should be addressed before you go down south? Who wants to go on vacation anticipating that?Good luck and good wishes on heading it off at the pass, ahead of your trip."
"Lots of water, drink my greens ( green zone by natures sunshine) and being activated charcoal capsules ( good for stopping) and a laxative tea (smooth moves) there are so many variables I just prepare for both "" worst case scenarios"""
We use to do the Pepto twice a day. I would start it 3 days before leaving for PV or the Dominican Republic. It worked really well. We now don't do anything preventitive and no problems. I think our bodies have adjusted.
"Many margaritas on the rocks, eat seafood constantly, eat any dessert that comes in sight, and have lunch daily at any taco stand that looks good. This works for me, haven't been sick ever. :-) To be serious, we always hydrate real well before our trip. And keep up with the water drinking everyday. Every so often we'll grab a bottle of electrolytes. That and work into the new routine slowly. And always use limes. A local told me many years ago that limes helps your stomach. After a few days go for it!! Enjoy"
"I'm very careful about what I eat and don't go too crazy with food or alcohol either one. Not sure what all you mean by ""living large"" but I'm thinking that might be the culprit (lol!).I stick to more simple meals, grilled fish, salads, pasta, chicken, and drink bottled water. I've still occasionally gotten sick from a restaurant meal, but not very often. I don't do anything 'preventative'.suze"
Thanks everyone for the great suggestions.I'm with Tan Sandy - I have a cast iron gut. Suze is probably right though!
"I'm with Tansandy,Eat/Drink like your going to the electric chair.Specs"
"Well hopefully this won't happen to anyone ever, but once you've been really sick from bad food a time or two you might choose to take things more cautiously. That's all. suze"
"Probiotics starting 2-3 weeks before your trip and continuing thru your trip to a week after. My husband who goes back and forth does this. Bottled water for everythign including brushing teeth. Ice is fine if in shape..cube, tube what have you. Pepto tabs if feel something coming on, remeber causes or can cause black stools and tongue. Watch the salsa if you note at a restaurant it is not chnaged or sitting out do nto use it. Handwashing, and more handwashing. If it tastes off or smells off then do not eat it no matter what, send it back."
"Dukoral doesn't seem to be available in the US. I learned about it last year before a trip to China and then PV. I asked several pharmacists and a doctor, and none of them had heard of it.The weird thing is that I read about it in a travel tips article in the Costco Connection - Costco's magazine, but the article was written by a Canadian."
"Dukorol is actually a vaccine to procect against cholera in epidemic, endemic areas. Puerto Vallarta does not fall into that geograpical demographic. http://www.cdc.gov/cholera/general/"
