"""The strain of the virus here cannot survive long in temperatures over 26C"" This is a myth! These and other myths about COVID-19 are listed here.See: https:/…coronavirus-myths-exploredThe virus will die off when temperatures rise 20. Some viruses, such as cold and flu viruses, do spread more easily in the colder months, but that does not mean that they stop entirely when conditions become milder. As it stands, scientists do not know how temperature changes will influence the behavior of SARS-CoV-2."
"Hi Guys,Thanks for info.Despite circumstances we are still looking forward to our trip.Cheers."
