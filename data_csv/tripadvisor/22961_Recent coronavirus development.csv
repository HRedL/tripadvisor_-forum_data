"Hi All,I planned my trip to turkey from 26 - 31st March. Hotel bookings, visa is all done. Due to recent coronavirus development I am wondering as to whether I should cancel the trip ? Also I presently reside in uae and all flights have been suspended to turkey. Last option is to travel to turkey via Azerbaijan. Is it risk at the moment ? Any suggestions or advice would be extremely appreciated."
As per today Turkey and Azerbaijan suspend air and road transportation ...
"Ishna, Here are the latest figures: ""https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"". Turkey has only 5 cases and UAE has 85 cases of coronavirus. And UAE is much smaller than Turkey, land area and populatiıon wise. So you figure where you would be safer, in UAE or in Turkey?Enigma..."
I thought you were posting a development.You're just asking the same questions already being discussed in multiple threads just below this one!
"Please stop opening threads on the coronavirus. There are already a dozen.Edited: 2:56 pm, March 14, 2020 "
The whole world is/is going to be affected. Make sure you have travel insurance no matter where you go to.Getting there is one thing but I think you’ll find eventually that all borders are in lock down and you will be stranded.
And placed in quarantine not in the hotel.What a miserable prospect.
