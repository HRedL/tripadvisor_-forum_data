"Hello, We are planning to do a mini trip to Estes Park/RMNP – (back to one of my “all time” favorite places FYI). Out of all the National Parks we have visited this is the one that always feel like home to me (I did live in Denver back in the late 80s and visited this place a lot). Oh, and this is future planning, not 2019 – I plan early to get first choice of accommodations, etc. Our last trip to the RMNP/Estes park area was a week late in August of 2014. Even though visitors had more than doubled annually since our previous trip (crowds didn't affect our experience, and we used the hiker shuttle on days we did not get up early and were going to popular trailheads). People told us our week was way lighter crowd wise than earlier weeks that year (probably due to so many schools that start by mid/late August, meaning later in the month is less crowded than earlier in August and July). This makes me think that maybe late August is still a good choice for a trip? There are three possibilities, though, I'm considering time wise for the Estes Park/RMNP trip and I'd love to hear which you would pick for us and why. (1) late Aug. again - some schools have started (so crowds although heavy I'm thinking probably would be tolerable), more ranger programs as still before Labor Day - I usually will do two or more ranger guided hikes or talks per trip if these are going - really enjoy those, and that McGregor Ranch which I have never visited before would still be open (not the case for Sept.)(2) Fairly early Sept. trip (mid week Mon – Fri) trip (early for Elk Rut) and would be timed with a new moon. We love to do new moon timing on trips out west for possibility of seeing all those stars (never a sure thing based on clouds, etc, but a good chance). We did this, this past summer for a trip to South Dakota and so enjoyed the night sky. Sitting out there and looking at all those stars gave us a real sense of awe (incredible and so cool). We live in a 3 million metro area, so have light pollution at home. All those stars are a real treat for us.(3) Later Sept. (mid week Mon. - Fri.) (later in month giving us a better chance to be there for the Elk Rut). If we are doing timing for the Elk Rut what time period would you recommend, given that we have a choice? We've never seen this before, so really don't know what we are missing. Would you recommend we delay our trip to later Sept. to increase chances to maybe see this?We have some flexibility for once, and I would love to hear which of these three options you would pick and why. I guess it's really picking between (more Ranger program possibilities and a chance to see the McGregor ranch, dark skies with a new moon, or better chances for the elk rut time). Thanks in advance for any opinions and thoughts."
"All three are great options and it’s my favorite time to go hiking because the weather is usually fantastic. The crowds will be worse later in September because that is peak fall foliage, which is definitely worth seeing. Just avoid all of the weekends in September. I’ve never paid attention to how the elk rut is in early September. The times I remember seeing it were in early October. You can hear the bulls bugling and maybe even see a fight or two. It’s also when the bulls’ antlers are the biggest and most impressive."
"Helpful information about RMNP visitation and overcrowding issueshttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g14304…Note on the above topic that RMNP visitation in September 2018 increased 15.2% over September 2017. I expect that trend to continue. Rangers have commented that visitation during the week in September is 50% less than on weekends. I think the disparity in crowds between September weekdays and September weekends is probably getting smaller.More information on RMNP crowdshttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g14304…The Longs Peak Scottish Irish Highland Festival (Scotfest) is always the Thursday through Sunday after Labor Day (09/07/2020) in Estes Park. The dates will be September 10-13, 2020. That event attracts about 80,000 people.The crowds start pouring into Estes Park and RMNP on most Fridays around noon. I know because I am usually headed back to Windsor by then and the traffic going toward Estes Park (especially on highway 36) is at times bumper to bumper.RMNP expanded daily shuttle service for the Bear Lake and Moraine Park shuttle routes through October 20 this year. I expect that will be the norm going forward. Columbus Day 2020 is October 12. That tends to be a busy three day weekend. Once you get into early October, you take your chances with the weather and whether Trail Ridge Road will be open or not. Snow can create icy trails (use traction devices) above 9,500 ft., but snow is rarely deep enough to need snowshoes or to create postholing except maybe at the highest of elevations. In many years, the snow holds off for the most part until mid to late October, sometimes even later.2020 best dates from a crowd perspective, good weather, and good trail conditions for Estes Park and the east side of RMNPAugust 24 - 28August 31 - September 4September 14 - 18October 5 - 9Grand Lake and the west side of RMNP do not have the excessive crowds experienced in Estes Park and the east side of RMNP. You might want to consider splitting your time between the two towns and between the two sides. Rangers programs, night sky viewing, fall color and elk rut happen on both sides of the park.Edited: 1 year ago "
Super helpful information! Thanks you fv1989. I really appreciate all the great information that you provide on this forum. Much appreciated!
Thanks so much GaxleFortCollins. Appreciate your posting. I agree about it usually being a great weather time. We might go late August again (get away from the hot weather at home).
"Last week of September into October is my favorite time. Crowds are heavy and rates are high, but I enjoy the Elk Festival and the weather.Already booked my spot and arriving on 9/21 for 14 days!"
"Thanks so much for the information and sharing your love of that time/season Freehike. Wow 14 days sounds heavenly. I'm envious. We've traveled thru lots of the state of Colorado (It's all nice, but lots of that for me is been there, done that, bought the T-shirt.), but RMNP is the main place that calls me back again and again."
"kathy884, if you have not been to RMNP in a few years, there are some very obvious changes. Of course, #1 is the number of people. For me, #2 is the overwhelming damage done by both the pine beetle and the spruce beetle epidemics. The infestation of millions of spruce trees in RMNP is now really showing up as the affected spruce trees have died and turned gray. Unlike the pine beetle epidemic which was more pronounced on the west side of RMNP, the spruce beetle epidemic is very evident on the east side of RMNP and has killed the forests along the upper elevations of Trail Ridge Road in mass. I have even noticed some dead and dying spruce trees in isolated areas of Estes Park.You can read about and see the map of the spruce beetle damage at this link.https:/…"
"Thanks for the update fv1989. That's sad to hear. We were last at RMNP in August of 2014, were in Keystone in August of 2015, and Colorado Springs, Salida, and Crested Butte in July of 2016. In 2014 I was noticing lots of trees at RMNP that looked dead (more brown than anything). I'm guessing that the park is still beautiful, but what a shame. The people difference was huge from 2005 to 2014 for sure. In 2005 we parked right at Bear Lake mid day, and the park and ride lot high season was practically empty (wild to see that lot full for the most part). We had heard this in advance (increased crowds) and used the hiker shuttle except for when we got up at 3:30 a.m., getting to Bear Lake by 4:30 a.m. with headlamps for hiking and did sunrise photos at Dream Lake and when we drove TRR. People told us we in 2014 that we had picked a good week compared to previous ones (later Aug. so many back to school).I have been visiting since 1989 and hope I won't be too disappointed next year (love love RMNP - one of my all time favorite places to visit). We'll be staying in Estes park due to better proximity to Bear Lake trailheads with my favorite hikes and for closer proximity to the McGregor Ranch that we have never seen and will visit if we travel before Labor Day (still TBD)."
