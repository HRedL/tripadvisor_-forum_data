"With the current pandemic, will Czech Republic be open to tourists from Canada in July?"
Probably not.
"The Czech Foreign Minister Tomáš Petříček has published a blog post for Aktualne.cz which is primarily intended for Czech citizens but is potentially of great significance to most if not all of us.  Here it is in full translation, thanks Rob Cameron. (you will note the UK is not mentioned, no idea why)We had hoped that closed borders were a thing of the past that would never return. Until a few months ago, I could never have imagined that I’d ever do something like this as a minister. Once again, it proves the old saying – “never say never.” Closing the Czech Republic’s borders as the COVID-19 pandemic spread was a logical step. It was a step that did not move the Czech Republic towards totalitarianism, as some evil tongues claimed, but a step – along with others - that protected us. And it wasn’t unique within the EU. The freedom to travel had to give way temporarily to the protection of human lives.Now we are - at least I hope, I’m not a doctor – past the worst, and we can begin to start trying to return to normal. Not in a rushed fashion, but in a reasonably fast one. No one wants to jeopardise the results we have achieved in tackling the coronavirus crisis.But people deserve to know when and where they will be able to go on a well-deserved trip or vacation. However, please be patient. At this point, the advice of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs remains that we do not recommend traveling abroad apart from cases of necessity. We’re not saying this for nothing; strict restrictions still apply abroad and you may suffer from transport complications.Nevertheless, I want to present to you a plan that I’m using as the basis for negotiations with colleagues from neighbouring countries - because the possibility to travel freely again does not depend solely on us: From July, I would like the borders to be fully opened to four neighbouring countries - Austria, Germany, Poland and Slovakia. I will be honest when I say that we are furthest in negotiations with the Austrians and Slovaks. Negotiations with Poland will probably be the most difficult. As far as Germany is concerned, this is the most heavily affected of our neighbours, and we must be very careful as to how the situation develops there. At the same time – i.e. July – we may be able to allow travel to more distant destinations, where they ‘fought’ COVID-19 just as well, or better than we did. I would therefore like to open the possibility of travelling to Bulgaria, Hungary and the Baltics as well. In short, I believe that from July we could begin to start returning to the normal functioning of the Schengen area and even beyond. From August, another wave of free travel could follow, not only to the much in-demand Croatia, but also, for example, to Greece, Slovenia and Malta (also very popular destinations for Czech tourists.) At this stage of relaxation, I would also like - and I repeat that this will depend on both the spread of the disease and agreement with other countries - to relax the travel rules for Canada, Australia, Japan and so on. Travel outside Europe will of course depend on the resumption of international flights. Some less good news: In the case of the worst affected countries, such as Italy, Spain, France, the USA, but also the Benelux countries, it is still premature to talk about when it will be possible to travel to them.But I will end on a positive note. If the situation develops in a positive way, all of this might happen even faster."
"""you will note the UK is not mentioned, no idea why""Probably because, thanks to our incompetent government, we have the 3rd highest number of deaths and will soon overtake Italy to take second place!"
"Have seen yesterday auto with Czech numbers in Latvia. So far don't understand how it was possible.)))From Sweden by ferry or on the way to Sweden?Edited: 5:05 pm, May 04, 2020 "
"Matt_pool There is version that in former socialist countries against kovid work our obligatory vaccines for some other diseases, as tuberculosis.Because measures everywhere are almost the same, but differences in numbers are so big, IMO there need to be some other factors than simply incompetence.And in all other things our government is far more incompetent that British.:)"
"#4 - Maybe the guy with Czech car got stuck there before restrictions were put in place, maybe it's a Latvian citizen living in Czechia, anything. I see quite a few foreign cars these days as well.I'm quite interested in what will studies say in five years or so. So far it seems, there is a lack of correlation between what is widely believed to be an efficient approach and the actual results. I'm worried we'll find out lot of this mess we've created was worth nothing.At the same time, I'm puzzled by some politicians (e.g. Petříček quoted above) talking in a fashion that suggest they believe the virus will just dissapear. Everyone must be aware that relaxing rules (and going out of our caves, so to speak) will cause virus to spread more rapidly. We bought our time and flattened the curve but it's time to accept reality and move on."
"Personally I wouldn't discount such a scenario. SARS-CoV-1 caused an epidemic in 2002 and then did exactly that - just disappeared. If SARS-CoV-2 does not disappear, by passage though large populations it may mutate to a weaker form to join the four other human coronaviruses that cause 20% respiratory infections every year. They were discovered in 1960s and it's believed that all of them caused some sort of epidemic in the times when there were no molecular tests, spread like wildfire through the globe and then weakened so that no one now is even remotely bothered about them.Edited: 11:43 pm, May 04, 2020 "
"What happened in two pandemic's ""black sheeps"" :) - Sweden and Belarus clearly shows real situation with virus instead of artificially created mass panic and severe fighting, up to destroying economics and freedom of people, against ""pandemic"" in other countries. So far I ask - ( even allowing understandable panic in beginning ) it's crime or stupidity?Edited: 9:23 am, May 06, 2020 "
"That notice was very odd that it didn't mention the UK at all, given how many British people travel to Prague. They do have a very high rate, so why weren't they mentioned along with Italy, Spain, France and the US?"
"#8: you don't seem very well informed. Look at Sweden's fatality rates compared to its neighbours, and the virus is now spreading fast in Belarus. There's no doubt that the lock-downs have saved many, many 1000s of lives and increased general awareness of social distancing."
"Those statistics are not really comparable because countries do not follow the same methodology and even change it half way though. Maybe some time in the future we will know how exactly how they were produced so that we can compare. And we definitely should wait for all the victims of this mass hysteria to be counted - suicides, mental illness, premature deaths due to late diagnosis of cancer and other diseases and so on.Edited: 12:28 am, May 07, 2020 "
"That's an easy way out, concerning the prevention measures of a deadly disease, though you just highlighted two concrete examples that were then corrrected.Edited: 1:28 am, May 07, 2020 "
"In terms of real numbers - for example in Poland the funeral industry is alarming that the number of funerals in March and April DROPPED by up to 40% in some regions compared with the same period in 2019 and 2018. So it seems the virus is not as deadly as some of the other causes (traffic accidents, air pollution, medical errors, operations and other health care related activities that were limited during this pandemic). And it's not their imagination - the Central Statistics Office (GUS) confirmed that during the two months of the pandemic the number of deaths in Poland decreased considerably compared with previous years (March 2020- 36557 deaths, March 2019- 36770, March 2018- 40700 deaths). People are wondering what the hell is going on."
"I've already made my points & won't derail this Czech forum thread any further.Edited: 1:59 am, May 07, 2020 "
"You can't compare Sweden's numbers with other states at this stage, simply because Sweden went for a faster wave than others. They didn't flatten the curve as much as others, because it's not needed. That means their peak is higher and earlier and for the time being they got more deaths. But the point of flattening the curve has never been that less people will get infected, rather that they will get infected over a longer period of time - the reason why we need to flatten the curve is to prevent health care systems collapsing, so we're not in a situation when even people who could be saved die, because they don't get medical help.And the truth is that Swedish is coping well, they can still provide health care to everyone who needs it, so there's absolutely no need to flatten it even further. Other countries are simply pushing the problem in front of them - those infections will eventually happen too, the virus is not just going to dissapear. Only they do it at much higher costs - and we're talking human lifes too, because these meassures we're taking will also kill people in the long run. But who cares when everyone only seem to be worried about those who die on Covid..."
"Just four short remarks: 1) the herd immunity strategy is an old subject, and its a gamble. Sweden is poor at testing, but it might be 5-8% of the population in the most populated areas, that show signs of infection, so it will be a very long-lasting effort. You need not 50, but 60-70 % for any herd immunity to function. And further, the virus mutates plus the human body weakens, so that any 'natural' immunity might just work for 1-2 years. Together with internationally based return of the virus, it is doubtful whether you gain much by the risky herd strategy then.2) you're forgetting that virus treatment and vaccines are created and improved over time. So with lock-downs, we're saving lives as well as valuable time to deal with the treatment problem in a better way.3) Tegnell, the Swedish top official, has a history of making wrong estimates and decisions. For the politicians, he's a convenient buffer, to avoid making hard decisions. From what I know, he was in charge of a vaccine program, that resulted in 400 people becoming severely handicapped for the rest of their lives.He also started all this by saying the Corona would not reach Sweden, and that it wouldn't infect between people. Yet he has kept his position, also in spite of some further, strange priorities, including insufficient testing.4) The four ~Scandinavian countries are comparable financially, in their apparatus ability to fight the virus, while compensating citizens and companies for their losses. But the Swedish business sector is actually complaining a lot and demands even more loosening, painting a catastrophic picture, like it's the case everywhere else. The capitalist mechanisms now extend to saying ""why organize a lock-down to prevent virus deaths, since more people might commit suicide later on anyway"". But those four countries have more wealth to weigh in, for the case of saving lives, and for dealing with the secondary problems that will occur.As said I don't want to derail this Czech thread, so I won't comment any further.Edited: 7:00 am, May 07, 2020 "
"1. As far as I know, Swedish strategy is not to create herd immunity, though it may be a by-product.2. Indeed, but can we really wait it out until we have treatment / vaccine, which may both be years away? We still don't have vaccine for the first SARS, for example. We still don't have vaccine for flu. Both are very similar in their nature to COVID-19, even if their infection rate is different for variety of reasons.3. I'm not disputing this, but it's ad hominem argumentation. I'm focusing on the actual results and facts.4. That wouldn't really be my argument, so I won't dispute it. I think there is far more to life than just economy and social and health-related consequences are the biggest issues, which is unfortunatelly being largely ignored these days. The way I see it, so far the Swedish model works exactly the way it was meant to work. Health care system is coping, people are recieving health care, there is no Italian/Spanish scenario everyone was haunting us with. The big question that will only be answered in a year or two, is whether others managed to keep overal death rate lower than Sweden, or whether they simply paid a huge price for nothing.Ultimately, this is a pandemic and people are going to die. We should obviously focus on keeping the number as low as possible, but we must also think about the price we pay for it. What I miss is people focusing on the big picture rather than just that one column in statistics. For example, my country seems to be the best in Europe when it comes to Covid, with the lowest death rate per capita. Great? No. Because I hear way too many stories about people not recieving health care due to them either being scared of going to the doctor, or outright denied (because hospitals are told to keep spare capacity for non-existing Covid patients, while they have a lot of actually sick patients waiting for their treatment at home). Does anyone care? No, because even when they die, they will not appear in the only statistic everyone looks at. For years, psychologists warned of ""loneliness epidemic"". Today, we hear of psychological helplines being overloaded. This will kill people (it doesn't have to be suicide, there are other health effects of anxiety and similar disorders). Does anyone care? No, prime minister's lovely statistic will still look good. And I could go on. We are even convincing people to not do the very things that we spent years encouraging them to do to improve their immunity - now we recommend them to deteriorate their imunity at the time when it's most needed to fight the virus - ironically, lowering their chances to survive if they get infected. It's wild, people are completely forgotting that Covid is not the only risk in the world. And that the meassures taken have their price as well.We learned to accept certain risks in life. We could prevent car accidents if we stayed at home. We could prevent other virological disseases if we stayed at home (and yes, even the evermentioned flu - it may not be as bad as Covid, but it still kills thousands). But we never did it. We went out, we lived our lifes and we accepted that one day, we will have to die too. I'm quite sure that ultimately same happens with Covid."
"We must remember that siting at home, one of ways of compulsory quarantine, worsens immune system. People can receive pneumonia just because of not going out to fresh air for a long time. Governments of countries, where was introduced compulsory quarantine for everyone, say home arrest, by doing this just show their insane level of participation in all this mass hysteria. And you are completely right about people, who didn't receive enough medical help because of this one overpopularized disease - covid.Speaking about situation in Belarus, we must remember that their approach annoyed creators of all this severe, full of panic, fighting against virus, and Belorusians receive just their fair share of criticism for not giving up."
"To get back to the Czechia, I just found this appeal of 11 doctors from Charles University who call for retraction of most of the restrictions on the basis that harm they cause outweights their benefits. This comes from the best-ranked university in Czechia.The text is only available in Czech, but you can use the Google Translator to get an idea: https://cuni.cz/UK-6311.html…But I'm afraid we don't live in an age where anyone cares about experts.Edited: 5:27 am, May 08, 2020 "
"Thanks, will look into.Problem is that politicans use so called ""experts"", which will tell whatever they want. The same with media coverage.Edited: 10:02 am, May 08, 2020 "
"What's new about border crossing for transit of Chech Republic without stopover? Read -it's already allowed in Austria.Edited: 8:23 am, May 18, 2020 "
"Transit is only possible on your way home (to the place of residence) and requires a letter from your embassy.In other words, it's unfortunately impossible for your intended purposes."
"I look on all this Kovi absurd theatre and just compare lack of reason's level of different governments, inventing those meaningless restrictions ( letter from embassy etc. ) of different kinds. :)(I can even compare in which phase of adequacy they are. So far in I have seen only one adequate government in things that refer to travel - and it's Croatian."
Sweden and Netherlands are also pretty good :)
