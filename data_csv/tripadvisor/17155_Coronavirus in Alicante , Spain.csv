I am coming to Alicante in first week of March and booked apartment via Airbnb. What is the situation in Alicante? Any cases discovered so far or not? does health officials doing proper cheks on airports?I am more curious to know who would have stayed in apartment before me and do I need to ask landlord to make sure apartment is safe to stay?
You’ll be less prone to infection in Alicante than the UK. Spain has a very low infection rate with only two cases as of yesterday - 1 each at Mallorca and Gomora (canary islands) and nothing reported on the mainland.
"If you're that concerned, you should probably stay home."
"There are two cases of it in the Torrevieja hospital at the moment but haven't heard of any in the Alicante hospitals. If i remember correctly these two are from Scandinavian countries and had been in china before coming to south costa blanca.How will the AirBnB owner know if the previous guest have been in Aisia before using his apartment.If it worries you that much then dont leave the house as you might catch it at your airport before coming to Spain.No checks at Alicante airport as it doesn't have long haul flights, they go to Madrid and yes they also have cases of it.Edited: 10:36 am, February 12, 2020 "
The majority of people getting Coronavirus are recovering fine.There have only been two deaths outside China.Try not to be overly concerned.
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is still only reporting two cases in Spain as of yesterday (12th) - neither on the Mainland. There are others in quarantine but not as confirmed cases - just like those who were quarantined and released in the UK.
"I would imagine you are more at risk of catching it at an airport than in the place you are staying, you are going to come into contact with thousands of potentially contagious people there, your accommodation is probably the safest place you’ll find yourself"
NHS for the airport in any circumstances is to wash/sterilise your hands straight after passing through security - all those germ-ridden trays are a bug’s idea of heaven.
I think at the moment it well worth getting an anti bacterial hand spray to use at the airport and on the plane.Hand hygiene is so important.
Anywhere is a germ area!!alwaysbe clean wash your hands !!! Toilets etc worse places!! People dont wash hands and then open doors!!! Arghhh dirty lot!! Always be clean stop the diseases spreading!! Its not much to ask . Wash!!!
I take it that you are a little frustrated.
"You should be more worried about getting flu in Alicante (3000 cases and considered an epidemic), also 10 times more deadly than coronavirus"
Will we ever hear from the OP again or is he/she self-isolating?
Now Italy and Europe is also frustrated https:/…world-europe-51638095

coming over in may all you have to do is the things you normally do wash hands taking wipes and just get on with your holiday more people die of flu anyway a lot of socalled experts just like scaring people.
Spot on Linda. The media induced hysteria is just crazy.
What a difference a month makes.
You need to update this post Spain has a third worst outbreak in the world of coronavirus
UK will follow...
Does anybody know how many cases of the virus are in the Valencia area I’m due to use Alicante airport on 1st April and getting concerned
Christine unless you have Spanish residencia you will not be allowed into Spain through Alicante airport. People who arrived yesterday on the BA flight from London had to show passports and residencia to get in.The figures that are published each day only show the whole of the Valencian region which is rather big and there are more cases in the city than down here.
"Its not beyond possibility that spain may have closed its airports altogether by then, or added restrictions dependant on where you are flying from.As above are you a spanish citizen or a returning resident?Is this travel essential?"

From a previous post I get the impression the OP is actually due to fly from Alicante to UK on 1st April.
