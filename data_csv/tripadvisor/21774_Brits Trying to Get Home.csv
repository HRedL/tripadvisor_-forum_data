"Britons stranded abroad due to the coronavirus pandemic are being faced with flights home costing more than £40,000, prompting a wave of accusations that the Foreign Office is failing to adequately support people desperate to come home.Britons in New Zealand told the Observer that the only available flights to the UK are prohibitively priced with even the cheaper tickets costing as much as £15,000. A Qatari Airlines flight from Auckland to London on 31 March was priced at NZ$83,534 (£40,096).Those stranded say they have been left without guidance or assistance after the UK embassy and consular services in New Zealand abruptly closed their doors last week.https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/mar/…"
"As a Brit, I am horrified to read this, can it really be true?Governments worldwide should be repatriating their people, whatever the cost to the country.The cost of this thing will be many trillions, so the cost to get people home will be a very small percentage."
"I imagine airlines are recouping the full costs of operating the flights. I read somewhere that they are allocating a row to each person, so that would triple or quadruple the fare for a start. Notwithstanding, some of the reported prices seem grossly exorbitant. I sincerely hope these airlines are not price gouging, but it certainly looks like it. There's a good case for countries to use military transport to repatriate their citizens, but I guess it's just not possible to bring everyone home."
To me it sounds like price gouging but as mentioned it doesn't say how many people are on the plane and whether they are social distancing which would mean the plane is three quarters empty and it still has to be fueled .
LOL Mike. I was more thinking they could use the RNZAF executive aircraft. The ones they use to fly the PM around.
"The problem, probably, is where would the plane refuel enroute if flying London to Auckland? There are so many restrictions now. A G5 Learjet can make it LAX to AKL on one tank of fuel but they always refuel enroute just in case sudden headwinds develop before Auckland."
"I suspect that Qatar is one of the very few routes left flying to get back sensibly from NZ to the UK The article of course is making the most extreme point but I just checked and the only flights available next week from AKl to Manchester are on 31/3 and are NZ$13,400 each in Business.That of course is still way beyond the means of most ordinary people.As far as I'm aware Qatar are not self distancing on their planes and I do have some informed knowledge. My younger son works for the handling agents who deal with Qatar at MAN and he tells me the planes are coming in from Doha twice a day full and should be running for another two weeks at least. Given that they are the only planes flying into MAN that his company deals with they are keeping him in a job right now."
"I've no idea if they really exist, but according to skyscanner there are flights Auckland to London via LAX with Air NZ for around$1600 and also for $1800 via KL with Malaysian, this week. Having said that, I would say it is best not to travel at all at the moment.Edited: 6:52 am, March 29, 2020 "
unfortunately some people just have to get home no matter what the cost so whoever is still flying can charge what they like.
"Why should landing to refuel be a problem?Surely as long as the plane remauns sealed on the tarmac while the refuelling takes place, there can be no danger of cross contamination? If the civil airports won't accept it, a military one must be used.In these unprecedented times, any measures needed should be taken."
"The huge numbers of seasonal workers (daughter incl), travellers and holiday makers suddenly finding themselves literally stranded and unable to move is totally incredible - thousands employed in QT were only informed a couple of days before the shutdown that they should consider their plans. When you work 12 hours a day (and sleeping) you really don't know what is going on - very little down there apparently!The Premier has acted swiftly but without considering any of these people and the UK have ignored them too ... very frightening."
"$13500 for Business is at the cheaper end of ""normal"". Ive looked at this in the past and business fares to Europe are usually around $15k unless you go with Korean or China Southern.There were comments in The Press today, I think from PM, that people from UK may have to settle in. It seems its the stop over that is the issue as the UK Government is looking at military aircraft.Edited: 3:55 pm, March 29, 2020 "
"Why can't the UK govt just hire as many planes as needed, to get people home.We did it not too long ago when Thomson holidays collapsed.It could be arranged to take a loads of Kiwi, or Aussies out, to save flying an empty plane, and help each other out.This thing may go on for quite a while, months, not weeks, how are these displaced persons to fund their enforced extended stay,?Edited: 4:11 pm, March 29, 2020 "
"It was only Athens to Sydney but last July I paid Au$4206 for Business Class with Qatar in June. Money I am now hoping to get refunded. I was considering Emirates, my usual airline, also at the same time and prices were not that different, I chose more on timing than price."
"<< thousands employed in QT were only informed a couple of days before the shutdown that they should consider their plans.>>Sarah, the entire country was informed we would be going into lockdown with just a couple of days notice. This entire thing has been building for months and wasn't unexpected. If I had been working in a foreign country I would have headed home far earlier than March. And yes, I lived and worked overseas for 25 years so know the realities. Hope your daughter is managing okay - she will have some fine stores to share with her grandkids one day :)"
"""Why can't the UK govt just hire as many planes as needed, to get people home.""Because you need to transit somewhere and all Transits hubs are closed. There is one Singapore repatriation flight to London (FULL of course) that has either left or is flying out which has been granted landing rights in Singapore but purely to refuel on the ground where passengers need to remain on the plane, with the exception of Singaporeans returning home..Same is happening to Kiwis coming home, 80 odd were coming back from South America, had tickets but were told they couldn't board as the connection was via Australia, and because the connecting flight wasn't in the same physical day, Australia would not allow them to disembark, even though they would remain in the airport.The issue now isn't so much getting a flight, but getting to the airport and finding somewhere to transit trough if you can't get a direct flight.Lufthansa just flew a group out of Auckland as German Mercy mission, but many more will come? Who knows, and is little value to Germans in the South Island as they can't get to Auckland. :(Edited: 5:09 pm, March 29, 2020 "
"Mike - there’s no real issue with a transit location at the moment whilst Qatar carries on flying. The issue is that it’s just about the only airline that is, so seats out of AKL are at a premium, hence the big prices. I did see that seats in a couple of weeks are from $3,300 economy or $10,000 in Business - much more normal.One issue for Qatar is that whilst the flights into Europe are full to bursting going the other way there’s very little demand coming east. Yesterday the two Qatar flights from Manchester to Doha had 28 and 66 passengers on. No wonder they want to make what they can going the other way.As a completely off topic comment to lighten the mood my son had someone today who tried to check in a hedge trimmer and a chainsaw!"
I can't believe that your daughter was not aware of the pending epidemic worldwide while in NZ.It started a lot earlier in other countries so messages would get back.Like many young people (here in Australia too) they think they are bulletproof and it won't effect them and when it does they complain why was I not told

"I'm not entirely surprised, having been a young OE-er myself at one time, rightly or wrongly you do tend to be a bit oblivious to a lot that's going on in the country around you, especially if travelling not living. The older you get the more you pay attention to the news, but the young ones, not so much.In Queenstown, the mayor has been asking the government for some sort of emergency financial assistance for the migrant workers who have been left jobless and stranded. It's a really difficult situation all around. They aren't this government's responsibility (as citizens of another country) but then there's the moral reality of people in desperate need through no fault of their own in most cases. This all happened so fast, I wouldn't be so quick to blame all the stranded people."
"What colour was4 the chain saw?I guess there wouldnt be as many young Kiwi on working holidays in the UK as the otherway around as they wouldnt have gotten in in the first place?Edited: 6:44 pm, March 29, 2020 "
I was still thinking my 2 month holiday would be on until I received an email from Romania on March 10th asking me to postpone or cancel a tour. I booked a ferry in Greece on 21/2 to take advantage of a 20% discount for booking 3 months early. There have been lots of flu epidemics coming out of Asia in my lifetime. Someone just reminded me about Hong Kong Flu in 1968. We just crossed our fingers and carried on. It was only when we began to hear about the situation in Italy that I became a little concerned as Albania was rather close by. Officially my Albania/Kosovo tour with a UK company starting May 6 is still on. I will be emailing them today as cancellation charges will go up from 40% to 60 % at the end of this week.
On todays news their was coment from PM that border will beclosed after stage 4 lifted.
"Not surprised. Don't want to get it under control here, then let in more cases. Won't be back to normal until a vaccine is developed. 12-18 months min."
"There clearly won't be many visitors in total in the UK given we're just coming out of Winter, compared to NZ being at the end of Summer. And there's a lot more of us than you!"
"I must admit that for my sins I do struggle to find much sympathy for people stuck overseas, mainly the younger generation. It's not like youngsters don't have access to the internet or parents who should be advising them."
Looks like Australia's PM is looking after the NZ workers in Australia form 6 months
I find it disgraceful it took him this long to step up and take action. Kiwis are treated like 3rd class citizens over there - we don't treat our Aussie friends who live here like that.

"Both governments still working to get Brits home *** In New Zealand, more than 9000 Britons are registered for repatriation purposes.***https://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/news/12069340…"
"As I’ve said before Qatar are operating a daily flight from AKL to Doha with onward transit to a variety of UK airports. Some of the days only have expensive Business tickets but there are others with Economy tickets for c$2,400 in the next two weeks to Manchester for example.The other issue is that many visitors can’t get to AKL to take the flights, which is obviously an internal issue for the NZ government."
Well they have set up the A&P grounds in Christchurch with motorhomes untill they figure it out.
"There seem to be some domestic flights. I just looked at AirNZ website for tomorrow and there are flights from Dunedin to both Auckland and Wellington via Christchurch. Apparently no direct flights and fares are not unreasonable. It seems from a quick glance that there are 2 flights from Dunedin to Christchurch tomorrow. I, of course, do not know what restrictions there are on flying but guess needing to catch the Qatar flight would be allowed."
I think things should be relaxed a little as long as passengers do no leave the airport to get home which is also in New Zealand's best interest.
"I understood that the only reason to fly internally was for “essential” travel. I think one of the issues is that at least to date, travelling to catch an international flight home wasn’t essential.."
Yes John things change daily if not hourly so best to check with the Government website to find the latest information.
An announcement re FCO plans to work with Airlines to get stranded British people homehttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-gover…
"The sooner we get these two out of the country, the better.https:/…"
Can you not keep them? Please?
"Nice try Andy, but they don't want to stay... they don't like our crap TV ."
I just wonder who is footing the bill for these people.We have heard of some complaints from people coming back from overseas and have to isolate at the government's expense for 14 days.I know it is not home but it might be someone's life you save.

"From the BBC this morning :""UK government plans record repatriationGetting Britons home from abroad is likely to be the biggest ever repatriation undertaken by the UK government, the transport secretary has said.Grant Shapps said the cost would come to £75m ($93m).He said: “I handled the Thomas Cook repatriation, which was the largest at the time, but this is even bigger because it is not a single airline and we don’t know where everyone is."""
"After the announcement from the High Commission today with a big ? over repatriation from NZ we booked our daughter on one of the few seats on a std flight on Monday back to the UK.Thinking it was only going to be 4 weeks (now not so sure...), she had really wanted to hole up in NZ and ride this out having just left her job in QT (voluntarily) and had had barely a week of exploring, before all hell broke loose.Really wishing the thousands of misplaced all the luck in the world and just hope flights and transport networks are opened to help sort out this mess"
How is she getting from Queenstown to Auckland Sarah?
"Hi johnShe was actually on a coach from the west to Christchurch when the announcement came out - by the time they got off the coach two hours later all boats, coaches and planes via the main hubs were fully booked. First time she’d seen everything shut too and had trouble buying food- seems QT really had been in its own bubble (see earlier posts!)We managed to contact someone near Hamilton - they eventually managed to buy flights - Christchurch - Nelson - Wellington - Auckland and a coach to near Hamilton. We were so relieved to get her safe as shes 20 and in her own but just over a week later she wanted to try and get home. She plans to come back to NZ, Oz etc when the worlds a better placeNot what you wanted to hear I know but it looks like they are going to try and open up flights from Christchurch to help all those stuck in the south according to today’s announcement."
"There are strange movements happening. Yesterday, out of curiosity, I looked at Dunedin airport departures and there was a direct flight departing for Nelson. That does not happen in normal times. Direct flights to Auckland and Wellington were cancelled. Only Christchurch otherwise."
New developments today on getting foreigners home:https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coro…
The treatment of tourists by the New Zealand government is disgusting. New Zealand has refused permission for repatriation flights and has effectively held foreign nationals captive
"For a few days that was correct, while they worked out how to do it. An official statement was made on this, and the news has just reported that the first flight has left Auckland. Get in touch with your Consulate, wherever they are (i understand, they were the first to leave)."
Where are you getting your facts Sunshine? Another first post Troll.The Governments first responsibility is to its own people. It's taken time to sort it out.
Sunshine - foreign nationals have known since January there was a world wide pandemic. So why did they choose to still be in NZ in March?
"The fact is that people are stranded all over the world,the problem is to get them home.In the case of the UK and NZ,I would like go think that each country will give whatever help those stranded need until they are finally repatriated.When it's all over, costs can be shared out."
"Too many people didn't want to believe what was happening, on the evidence of TA both tourists and locals. Hell, I was even made to feel that I needed to apologise for suggesting otherwise. Now it is what it is, but taking swipes at NZ for the lethargy of ""tourists"" is not fair."
"Andy as I said in a parallel thread, it's a nightmare, but Govts must get their heads together, and get it sorted.I wonder if the United Nations could play a role?"
Sunshine - scheduled flights have continued to operate from AKL so there has been no need for special repatriation flights (for European citizens at least). The problem for a short while was that NZ would not allow travel back to Auckland for travellers but this has now been changed.
Not sure what Sunshine was doing in Rotorua in March when the coronavirus was taking over the world and made no attempt to go home then. Now it is quite difficult.Might be an idea if there is a valid explanation on why sunshine didn't make arrangements to get home earlier.
"Sunshine - or should I say Mike Rowland, please never return here."
"I see the UK is initially chartering 7 flights to get people home from India. Heck, I don't even agree with that, let alone the much more complicated flights from a first world country like NZ. And we have reports of flight crew being infected.Bad tourists and travellers should have to stay where they are for however long this thing takes."
"""Bad tourists and travellers should have to stay where they are for however long this thing takes."" Nice to see such humanity Andy J. Let’s hope you or your family never get stuck between a rock and a hard place."
"Well said ,crellston, Maybe the lockdown is getting to Andy"
Great to see most governments are concerned for their people and are trying to do what they can to bring them home.Better to be in their own country if they can be.
"TBF I have been pretty consistent with this all along. It's just my opinion. A minority one, but that's never really bothered me, I'm not here for likes.I favour protecting the majority, same reason I wouldn't have let all the passengers from the Ruby Princess and other ships go walkabout."
"You are entitled to your opinion Andy, as others are to theirs.It's a bit like Brexit, there is no half way, you're either for or against. Seems like ancient history now, one day this unpleasantness will be too."
"Andy, you came to NZ, made your comments about us, some I remember as unpleasant, you were fortunate to get back home before all this started. Now I wish you would just leave us alone, isolate yourself and shut up, You come across as one of the less pleasant types of Brit. My last overseas trip was to London and the UK but I never visit or comment on that site any more. I do not think that a month in country ( actually nearly a year over my long life in the UK) makes me an expert."
"I don't think I have made a single unpleasant comment about New Zealand or New Zealanders FedUp have I? I have criticised certain types of tourists but I honestly cannot think of a single negative comment about NZ. Please correct me if I am wrong. You have called me rude before so I am already well aware of your opinion of me, but my opinions are actually as valid as yours or anybody elses."
"Indeed Haddaway, Brexit seems a world away now, it's incredible that the issue has faded into total insignificance."
"I must be bored, but I quickly found a criticism of the roadworks around my beloved city, I think there were other criticisms of Dunedin, you made some comment about passing quickly through it.  Don't get me started on London, however I am polite. I had to look up Leyburn. My best UK friend lives in Shipley so have often walked on the Yorkshire Moors. If you are so critical of your government spending on bringing British tourists home, I am sure there are better places close to home to spread your bile than the NZ Forum,. I have just watched the speech by the woman I admire most in the world. Reminds me that I was brought up to love England. I remember being so excited when I first visited in 1974, coloured by the fact I had just had to get out of Tehran trapped by the Cyprus crisis. I learnt early the risks of tourism. However the last time I left the UK. I was glad to be leaving and as always glad to be headed for Paris. I think Paris and Vienna will be my first aims to return when this is all over. I love going to London for the 'Proms' but nothing else would ever draw me back there."
"Please everyone, can we all just agree to be nice? We don't have to agree, we don't have to like each other, but can we please remain respectful? If you don't like what someone writes, just move on. Many other forums (fora) are hard to read with all the hatred. As our PM says, be kind :)"
Everyone deserves to get home. People make mistakes and some stay longer than they should but as WLnz says we need to be kind in these very hard times.As many slogans are pointing too #weareallinthistogether# We need to get over it and enjoy life as best we can at the moment.As for the Ruby Princess no matter what has happened in the past we in Australia still need to look after the sick on board the vessel BEFORE it leaves Australian waters as it is a long way home and more people will die on board.Compassion is what is needed right now more than anything.

"Andy,Don't take the hump! Be sorry to see you go."
"Cheers Haddaway but I will leave actually, though NZ has my love. This was the first holiday that I needed help organising and the forum was really helpful in firming up some of the details - no other forum has really come close for me yet. So many thanks to everyone. Maybe we'll be back to NZ in 10 years time to do the bits we missed out on this time, that would be nice. I might give Dunedin a miss though! If only I had found NZ 20 years ago and be in a job that would have enabled me to emigrate, that would have been perfect. I hope everyone realises how lucky they are to live in NZ, I'm sure they do."
"Andy, I greatly enjoy your posts, please don't go. I said ** If you don't like what someone writes, just move on.** but I wasn't talking specifically to any one person and I sure as heck didn't mean leave!!!Please stay :)"
"Thanks WL but I really meant to leave after our holiday finished. FedUp is right there, what am I doing still on here? It's like an itch you can't leave alone. But much nicer obviously!I guess I'm a bit like marmite. Or maybe vegemite. My farewell is doing wonders for the post count though!"
"NZ is addictive, this forum is addictive. So see, you are addicted, you can't possibly leave... plus you still have much to contribute :)"
"I'd encourage you to stay too Andy, even though you do live in Yorkshire. The Forums should be spaces for all sorts of views - it would be a very boring place if everyone agreed all the time.I too cannot profess to be an expert on New Zealand but after three trips I feel i can offer a different perspective at times for people coming here for advice. I think it's important that those who have visited can offer their views as an added benefit to that of the local experts. It works well on the UK Forums too where we see a number of overseas visitors offering regular good advice.I also think it's perfectly legitimate to offer an occasional opinion which doesn't play to ""this place is so beautiful"" which you get on most Forums. Nowhere is perfect and as long as people make constructive comments I think that's fine.On the point that got you into trouble Andy I'm certainly conflicted. We were for a few days looking at the possibility we could get stranded in NZ in mid March. When NZ said that everyone had to self-isolate on arrival I feared that our alternative flight out on Thai Airways would get cancelled and we would be back scrabbling for another option. We could have stayed and hunkered down in a rented home somewhere but, whilst it would have been fine, it's better being home.Clearly some people have been stupid and have got caught out but probably the majority are there through no real fault of their own and some are quite happy to stay - i think there's an American guy who has decided to stay in Kaikoura. I assume there are a lot of young people on working holiday visas but now with no work, maybe nowhere to stay and little money who need to get back. There is a thread on the UK Forum about a young kiwi couple in the reverse position, but who have now just got back.FedUp - if it's any consolation I don't like London either - I think there are at least 10 other more interesting cities in the UK. Mind you, I'm not keen on Paris either!Apologies -as usual I've gone on a bit but then there's not much else to read at the moment."
Well it's so nice to see the banter going backwards and forwards about the Brits trying to get home.Just give a thought for those poor cruise ship workers stuck on the Ruby Princess at Port Kembla looking at the coal loaders.This is a humanitarian disaster at the moment.I think I would much rather be stuck in a House at Kaikoura.
"I adore London, but prefer living in New York. I found the class system in London restrictive at times, while New York allows more freedom."
"When we visited Dunedin, we were very taken with it.The laid back atmosphere of the place around the Octagon was great.It's just a nice maneagable size.London? Sorry, not for us, mind you no big cities hold much appeal."
"John, I would class you as a good tourist for making sure you got out, but you left it way tighter than we would have, and came perilously close to falling into my bad tourist category!!I've been following this forum for 18 months now, so I kind of get people's characteristics, and I know that FedUp goes a bit OTT at times, telling people to butt out and stuff, and I have no problems with that. I don't mind taking it as well as giving it, but what I do have an issue with is being tarred with this brush of one who has made unpleasant comments about NZ, which I totally and utterly deny. It seems like the worst FedUp can find is the following reply.""The drive anywhere on the Otago peninsula was absolutely gorgeous"".Not all the roadworks on Portobello Road though surely!"
"""Classing"" people as ""good"" or ""bad"" tourists on the basis of the date on their airline ticket?! I find this distasteful. Tens of thousands of people of various nationalities and all ages are stranded all over the world. Presuming to know all their individual circumstances, motivations and decisions is ridiculous and arrogant. I've made the argument before that not everyone now stuck in NZ did so out of willful ignorance. And even if you were to presume that people would milk their holiday/stay to the last possible minute, governments have sent very differing messages about what to do. If you were to trust your own government, there may very well NOT have been an urgent 'come home' message before NZ implemented lockdown measures and flights started drying up. Are some people now caught by their own actions, ignorance or fault? Probably. Are all of them? Probably not. Writing off everyone who is stranded is, in my opinion, the easy way out and rather self-congratulatory. I really feel a bit of nuance is called for, over sweeping generalizations of large groups of people. When did grey disappear from the spectrum? On another note: I sincerely hope that people not currently (residing) in NZ are still welcome on the forum. I'm another not-local who enjoys this corner of the internet and I'll admit the sentiment expressed earlier has hit a bit close to home for me. I vehemently disagree with Andy, but I wouldn't argue that they shouldn't be here just because they live in the UK. They can add to travel-related questions, and have done so in the past. I just wish that came with a bit more kindness in these current circumstances, but that's a separate matter..."
"I'm pretty sure FedUp's anger is directed exclusively in my direction Zwan, you're OK. And anyway he speaks for himself, not for the forum as a whole. If FedUp starts throwing words like unpleasant, just leave us alone, isolate yourself and shut up, less pleasant type, bile, rude etc in your direction then you know you're in trouble as well!"
"I'm with Zwan. Have to say that when people will look to this post in the hope of some constructive help as many will be really worried or alone and frightened, I'm really shocked that some see fit to give so many a hard time without having a clue as to their personal circumstances and without the slightest hint of help, advice or compassion. Pleased to say the opposite of all my experience of TA forums in the past 10 years ...My daughter is currently on the flight from AUCK-KL-London and we're very lucky to have found a flight. I really pity the other 10,000 stuck in motels, tents, sleeping in churches and on floors etc - many haemorrhaging money but hopefully safe.For the record, Queenstown was fully operating as normal as far as the tourist and the adventure trade was concerned up until the third week of March (one or two companies later apparently). We - those parents who did try to advise from the end of January onwards - were repeatedly told things were normal and stop worrying. The first real info from work (general hand-washing stuff - not very useful up a mountain) and noticeable changes in shops came about mid-March.I have a strong feeling that it was in everyones interest that QT kept operating as normally as possible for as long as possible after the appalling weather issues earlier in the season. And I think it has left the thousands of young people in the dark as to what has been going on outside the work/sleep bubble and in an impossible situation. Luckily my daughter resigned a few days before it all kicked off and was already well on her way up the island, so ahead of many others. Only my thoughts"
Great to hear sarah-on-her-hols that your daughter is on her way home.Must have been some worrying times over the last few weeks.Hope she arrives home safely and virus free.
"Good to hear your daughter is on the way home Sarah, big relief for you :) I have no idea what I missed here, with all the deleted posts. I shall repost my earlier request - Please everyone, can we all just agree to be nice?We don't have to agree, we don't have to like each other, but can we please remain respectful?If you don't like what someone writes, just move on.Many other forums (fora) are hard to read with all the hatred.As our PM says, be kind :)"
"Sarah - all of New Zealand was operating as normal until things changed on us quite rapidly. We went into a level two alert which did not change very much and then, within a couple of days (was it Monday, three weeks ago?) we went to level 3 as a precursor to level 4 coming into operation two days later. Level 3 stopped gatherings and made places like cafes and restaurants go takeaway only, then it was lockdown for anything non-essential. So it was fair enough that Queenstown was business as usual - just the weekend before we went into level 2 I myself was at a beer festival in Nelson - hard to imagine now!As for those who don't live here or who have not spent a sustained period of time here, it would be ridiculous if this forum became a place that they are not to share their experiences. Many people who are here for 2 or 3 weeks will be experiencing New Zealand in exactly the same way as the typical visitor to New Zealand will be, and sharing from that perspective is important.Edited: 6:37 pm, April 06, 2020 "
Been to NZ 5 times and absolutely love the place.Just a short flight across the big ditch makes visiting very easy.Nice country feel to New Zealand a little like Tasmania here in Australia.When things settle down i am sure we will be back again to enjoy more of the wonders of New Zealand.Hang in there folks the good times will come back.
Very nicely said Barry :)
"Let's not forget that it takes agrivation to make a pearl. If TA became a place were we just exchanged information it would be boring. I hope we can entertain each other a little.I've seen posts on other forum (is it forae?) where folk have objected to a pit of stick poking, I guess our cultures are different. If your skin is super thin you should avoid anything from this little corner of the world.However, there are boundaries. Sometimes we cross the line. Let's not get personal. It's ok to call out stupidity, or offence, but judgement should remain in gear."
"I wake up this morning to find that only one of my posts is now missing so that's an improvement I guess. It's pretty tricky for one man to defend himself against the world at the best of times, but even more so when he isn't allowed a right of reply."
"I love London. IMO the greatest city in the world. Best summed up in the words of Samuel Johnson ""When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life""Another Samuel Johnson quote - ""Being in a ship is being in jail, with the chance of being drowned"" - I guess he wouldn't have been a fan of cruising."
"Daughter safely back home this morning - very sad to leave NZ having only spent around a week exploring after leaving her job but already has a list of where she wants to see when she returns ...Just a word of advice for anyone who manages to get a flight out - there are absolutely no shops open anywhere inside the airport and only one vending machine with drinks. Go prepared and take good!! And any social isolating you attempt in the airport, the flights are packed like sardines (we paid and moved her to a window seat thank goodness as we are high risk) Good luck!"
"Andy, We're not all agin you, some of us has asked that you don't spit the dummy, and stay on this forum, poor world if we all agreed etc.You seem anyway to have reversed your decision.Good."
"Haddaway, I remain on this thread to defend my integrity and my honour against falsehood as necessary!Other threads not involving me are available.Edited: 11:16 am, April 07, 2020 "
"John EW - re ""Another Samuel Johnson quote - ""Being in a ship is being in jail, with the chance of being drowned"" - I guess he wouldn't have been a fan of cruising.""I am with him on that too. Even before all of this you couldn’t have paid me to go on a cruise!"
"crellston,I wholly agree with that, but obviously many many people dont.We're a bit off the subject now, but let us hope that all people of whatever nationality do get home in the not too distant furure."
"From the GuardianUK to repatriate vulnerable Britons from New ZealandThe British government will charter flights to repatriate the most vulnerable Britons stranded in New Zealand this week, with three flights from Auckland and two from Christchurch.People most at risk from of coronavirus will be prioritised for the flights, which will bring back over 1,500 people in total. This includes people over 70, those under 70 with an underlying serious or complex health condition and those who are pregnant.The first flight is expected to depart on Friday 24th April and flights will continue to run every second day, with alternating departures from Auckland and Christchurch.This follows the government having previously stated it would be unable to repatriate Britons in New Zealand due to the country’s strict lockdown.After a phone call between Dominic Raab and the New Zealand’s foreign minister Winston Peters at the end of March, the British high commissioner Laura Clarke had said there would be no “immediate fixes” because New Zealand’s strict lockdown and the closure of international flights made it almost impossible.“The New Zealand government’s level-four Covid guidance is now absolutely clear in limiting domestic flights and transport to essential works only. That means if you are not close to your departure airport you are going to struggle to get on an international flight home,” Clarke had said in a video statement on 30 March.Tickets for the charter flights will cost £800. Travellers able to prove financial hardship may be able to get an emergency loan from public funds.2,600 Britons have already returned home via commercial means since the outbreak of the coronavirus, with some being quoted over £40,000 for a ticket."
"I am sure that getting to an exit airport was classified ""essential"" travel a few weeks ago?"
A lot of the brits are probably doing it real tough so any assistance to get them home is welcome and it is great to see cooperation between countries to see these people repatriated home.
"Agree with you GTS. Its just the comment about difficulty in getting to Auckland or Christchurch surprised me.There has been a lot of effort by governments world wide to get people home.It pretty understandable that, as per Simon and Garfunkle, Home is where I want to be."
Mike - as long as they don't go and look for America on the way home.
I think you would want a trip where you didnt get out !Probably safer in NZ but no place like home!
"Absolutely nothing in the way of social isolating on the way back to the uk through the various airports on the way - some very interesting face gear though! Our daughter spent her time sitting on floors trying to keep her distance from the throngs at customs, gates etc as much as poss. And so glad we changed her to window seats in the packed planes (internal NZ ones were one per row during the 48 hour pre-lockdown dash!)Luckily all’s well after her 48 hour isolation - probably way safer in NZ but not the place for travellers right now sadly ..."
48 hours! Returning to NZ is 14 days supervised quarenteen!
There’s actually no compulsory self isolation of any sort for arrival into the UK beyond abiding by the current lockdown rules. And that’s actually in line with current WHO advice.
"John, as far as the health authorities are able to determine there is no community spread of the virus in NZ.  the only way for the virus to get here is by people bringing it with them into NZ and passing it to others - and so everyone arriving in the country has an enforced 14 day quarantine. I suspect that until the virus is gone worldwide, some form of quarantine will continue for all arrivals in NZ."
WLnz I would think that there will be temperature testing for all incoming passengers or scans for the foreseeable future when the borders do finally open.
I hope there will be more than temp testing - what about those asymptomatic carriers?
"Until such a time as a successful vaccine has been created for this virus New Zealand's borders are going to remain tightly controlled. Otherwise there was no point in going through the 5 week lock down to get it under control.There may be some easing of restrictions on international travel between the Pacific Islands (some with 0 recorded cases) and Australia, when both Countries are at a comfort level.With the uncontrolled and poorly managed spread in the US and the UK, don't expect those borders to open soon, and with Europe struggling under the weight of the spread, NZ and I suspect OZ, won't be opening borders to Europe anytime soon either.China is the most likely nation outside of Australasia and the South Pacific to gain entry to NZ & OZ, as both having it under control and being a major trading partner.Tourism for NZ is going to struggle well into 2021, maybe even as far out as 2022."
"""I suspect that until the virus is gone worldwide, some form of quarantine will continue for all arrivals in NZ."" it will likely be several years before the world is free of Covid19, do you think the NZ economy could survive an extended period of isolation? Perhaps it is more likely that many counties will insist on some form of documented immunity, similar to that for yellow fever, which itself will take a lot of time due to the time lag in developing a vaccine and efficient and accurate mass testing. Increasingly the view in many countries is that the damage caused to the world economy by this virus will/ is beginning to cause as many deaths as the virus itself. Difficult decision face world leaders.in the not too distant future.."
Let us all hope we don't take our leads from the USA otherwise we are all doomedI am am glad I live in a country where the leaders have some commonsense
"On the money again GTS.The NZ ecconomy will survive no international tourists.There have been several ecconomist, including the chief ecconomist from ANZ, hardly a left wing radical, was on TV last night saying ecconomic damage would have been worss without the lockdown.We need to diversify. We lost our biggest trading partner in 1973, they are now 12th. Things wont look the same but we can handle this.We wont handle the virus getting out of control.Edited: 3:05 am, April 21, 2020 "
"John, as far as the health authorities are able to determine there is no community spread of the virus in NZ.WLnz - I know and that's why the current entry arrangements in the UK and NZ are different.The WHO advice is that there is no advantage in restricting entry into a country where community spread is currently active. That is the case here but not with you. As soon as we can get to your position there will ne doubt be different arrangements."
"""China is the most likely nation outside of Australasia and the South Pacific to gain entry to NZ & OZ, as both having it under control and being a major trading partner.""I guess that would be a good way to test whether China really ""have it under control"" Eugene. I'm not sure I would trust their figures personally but obviously China is absolutely huge for NZ and Australia. We wait to see what sort of a backlash, if any, there will be against China from the West in a post Covid world."
Unfortunately I don't believe China either even though NZ and Australia have big interests with China for trade etc .They both need to tread cautiously.
>>Let us all hope we don't take our leads from the USA otherwise we are all doomed<<I agree.

I am running shuttles from our location to the Airport. You would not believe the paperwork I need to have. To be honest I have to think of my health as well as a priority.
>>Let us all hope we don't take our leads from the USA otherwise we are all doomed<<Agree

#124 +1Totally agree.
Great piece of writing Rantin Rover. Pleased you got home OK.(Its soon to be ex Minister of Health! What a plonker)
Glad you made it safely home Rantin rover and you did enjoy NZ as best you could.It will come back but just maybe a little different for quite some time.
"#126 Rantin you are quite right that we need to be a bit cynical about figures. Our case figures are ""confirmed and probable"", and our death figures include all deaths, not just hospital figures like in the UK.The key comparrison is the ""per 100,000"" figure. The USA looks really bad but their population is well over 300 million. If you break it down to per 100,000 the UK figure is well ahead of the USA.The NZ death figure is not so hot when you use the per 100k comparison.Edited: 4:34 am, April 26, 2020 "
"Yes Mike, the old saying about ""lies, damned lies and statistics"" and ""simple liars, damned liars and experts"" need to be in your mind when looking at the figures from anywhere.In the UK, there is frequent criticism about the absence of deaths registered at home and at care homes which for some reason are not as accurate as the figures from the hospitals. Elderly people with ""complex healthcare issues"" are dying in large numbers, surely they know why and those which include Covid-19 could be included. As you say the rate per head of population is also very relevant.We are following the guidance of the NZ government in this case and self isolating for 14 days....only 7 more to go and we will be able to do all the things everyone else can do. Ehmm? Not much change there then. I raise a glass of disinfectant and wish you all the best!"
"""Experts"" pronounced exspurt where : x being an unknown quantity and spurt a drip under pressure"
"Yes that word ""Expert"" has been used by many and right in your context NZMike.."
"""The NZ death figure is not so hot when you use the per 100k comparison.""Nonsense, where on earth are you getting that from?? Oz is at 3 per Million, NZ is at 4 per Million?The US, even with their 330m Population is at 171 per m, the UK at 311 per m, Spain at a horrific 503 per m, and Germany, with its much heralded response is still 72 per m. Even Sweden with their carry on regardless approach is 225 per Million.Many others with death rates in single digits are only just starting their cycle like India, South Africa and South America. If NZ stays around 4 per million then per capita has done incredibly well."
"Yes,very pleased with the efforts in OZ and NZ .Will be interesting to see what happens in NZ with the restrictions relaxed slightly from today."
