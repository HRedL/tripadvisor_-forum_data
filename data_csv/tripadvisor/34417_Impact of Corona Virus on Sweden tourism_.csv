"Hello,We are planning to travel with kids to Sweden Norway & Denmark. We would be arriving in 3rd week of May 2020. I was about to book my hotels when my wife asked to delay & reschedule the trip to a further date. I really don't wish to do that. I am very excited about visiting these beautiful places this summer. But because we are travelling with the kids I want to be safe. I need advise on my travel plans. **We are Indian nationals. We havent travelled to Italy or China or any other place which is effected. **No corona outbreak in India."
Impossible to say isn't it? It looks quite ok today with 14 cases and a slow daily increase. But who knows? I would go ahead though. Book hotels with the provision 'pay at arrival - cancellation possible' . Costs a bit more but saves you a bit of worry.
"At least this portal is offering news on the situation in English. You may check the current status. https://www.thelocal.se/20200228/what-you-ne…In general the Nordic countries have very advanced health service and emergency service systems. Even if the cases started to increase, it's very likely that everything stays calm and normal, people here don't usually panic with these things and everyone gets treated. I live in the neighbouring country and right now they are still trying to quarantine all the people having contact with the virus and encourage people to wash their hands. Buying time, I think. But very calmly."
"Yes, obviously it's too early to know much about this and the exact developments."
"I can write a lot about it but it summary, we don't know what the future will look like. If you want official information about the situation, see: https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueea"
