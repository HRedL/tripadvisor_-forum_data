"Six weeks since trip and I can barely walk. Severe joint pain, nausea, fatigue, swelling. There is no cure or treatment. There were NO NOTICES that this awful disease was on the island. No postings in hotel or stores. They don't want their tourism effected. The family practice at Red Hook is seeing people so ill with this they are being brought in to the clinic in wheelchairs. It is not worth seeing any of this island to have this awful devastating illness now."
What are you speaking of! Please say! We will be down there in 3 wks
"Check out travel advisories for the Carribbean. Chickguinea virus is spread by mosquitoes that are covering the islands. There is no vaccination or cure. I have never dealt with such terrible joint pain. I could not even open my eyes for three days. Nausea, fatigue. It has been over 5 weeks and I am still very ill. I have gotten vitamin C iv's for treatment, but really that's all there is. I wouldn't ever go back there and I wouldn't trust mosquitoe repellent either. I don't want to be a bad news person, but I can tell you I am afraid that I will not be able to afford the time it is taking me to get better. Tourism in islands don't want to tell you about it, because you might change plans. Many cruise lines are losing customers because of this. Check out the CDC we site. The cases at clinics on the islands are huge."
"Alli1976: It is actually called chikungunya and is a virus spread by mosquitoes and is similar to Dengue Fever. Chikungunya has been in the USVI for less than a year and is also in Florida now. When you go to the USVI or anywhere in the tropics, it is recommended that you use mosquito repellent to avoid being bitten, preferably one with DEET. Here is a link to the CDC website with more info.:…cdc.gov/travel/…chikungunya-caribbean"

"It has been in our paper and has been declared epidemic in the VI and is on the internet and has been mentioned many times here on tripadvisor ... virginislandsdailynews.com/news/epidemiologi…Please wear Deet as this is the only ""prevention"" Average duration once you have it and for it to run it's course is 7 days (obviously it can last longer) and symptoms show up once bitten 1 to 12 days after with the average being 3-7 The good news is once you have had it you can't get it again (unlike Dengue) and it is not deadly.Pia"
"Hi titirocks Sorry to hear of your troubles. Be careful there at home:ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. — People in the St. Augustine area are advised by the Florida Department of Health in St. Johns County of an increase in mosquito-borne illness.DOH-St. Johns said the West Nile virus activity has increased in the area, and several sentinel chicken flocks tested positive for the virus. The risk of the disease transmitting to people has increased, said the DOH-St. Johns.The Anastasia Mosquito Control District and DOH-St. Johns continue surveillance and prevention efforts, said the DOH-St. Johns. - See more at: actionnewsjax.com/news/…sthash.POaoMmNV.dpufEdited: 5 years ago "
"I should mention it is not only St John - please see the following notification.....""Local transmission of chikungunya is now being reported in other countries in the Caribbean.

"Titirocks, i am sorry you are so ill and that does stink i also hope you recover soon. However, I have to disagree with you in regard to notification about mosquito borne illnesses, which are nothing new to the tropics btw. The cdc and the vi department of health have been putting out advisories regarding this virus for some time now. I am concerned, but considering west nile is in NJ now and contracting dengue has always been a possibility in the islands i just plan on being extra vigilent with prevention."

Yes I do blame local hotels for not giving out information about this virus. After I came back there were travel advisories popping up all over St. John web sites. Yes I am jaded due to the symptoms of this I am having to deal with. Many times people on vacations do not realize to take same precautions as they do at home. For this I feel very stupid and responsible for. But others need to know about this awful virus and how to prevent it. I wouldn't trust any type of repellent from preventing this.

"I arrived in the Cyril King airport in St Thomas yesterday. A person was handing out warning flyers to each arriving passenger with detailed information on protection from mosquito bites, and clear warnings about the virus. I am sorry it won't help you, but it may be some comfort to know that every effort is being made to warn other travelers to take steps to protect themselves."
Thank you so much for posting this. I just really wanted to get the word out about this awful virus. I should have been more aware myself and used precautions. Yesterday I had to start prednisone to try to combat the severe arthritic symptoms of this virus. It is very debilitating and so far no real cure.
"Titirocks, I am so sorry that you are suffering with this disease and hope the prednisone will help. I do have to disagree with you regarding notification. My family and I were there in July. I must say that I am a firm believer that when travelling it is my responsibility to be aware of any issues that may arise while I am away!The info about Chik V was all over the tripadvisor forum, the cdc website and the VI Now forums - I made sure to travel with tons off deep woods off this trip!!I am sorry that you didn't do your homework - the info was out there. Get well soon!"
"I know I was negligent in doing the research as it was a quick trip. Just had no idea and saw no notices while I was there. Believe me, I am beating myself up for not checking beforehand as this virus is awful. Thanks for your kind thoughts."
If you know you were negligent maybe you should stop complaining on the forum. Most people know when they go to the tropics that they need to use protection from mosquitoes. It is probably time to give this a rest.
"I agree. Purely for the benefit of other visitors, the OP's reaction to the virus was HIGHLY unusual and way outside the norm."
"For what it's worth, I remember reading about the presence of the virus before I visited STJ in April of 2014."
Thank you for the warning. I have been reading up for months on travel to places in the carribean and this is the first I've heard of this.

"WOW - never heard of getting this virus! -We were just in ST THomas this past July & noone ever mentioned this, the only notice or warning we received were about the no-see-ums on the beaach at night - thats it!! Never about knew or heard a thing about this virus you can catch from mosquitos. Thank you for the warning/head ups. I hope you get better soon & make a full 100% recovery."
Kinda makes me think twice about going again next year
"Well Lori you will be limited in where you can go in the Caribbean then :(From the CDC website.......""Local transmission of chikungunya is now being reported in other countries in the Caribbean.

"Lori, dengue has been here for donkey's years and the chikungunya is similar. The Department of Health is already seeing a decrease in the number of reported cases which is common as more of the population becomes immune - confirmation from the CDC is currently being awaited, If you read all the OP's posts on the subject it's abundantly clear that she had a highly unusual reaction to the virus and she also failed to use any protection at all against mosquitoes."
"Lori - your home state of NJ also has many diseases carried by mosquitoes and ticks, some of which can be lethal. Thinking about not going to the USVI does not really make any sense. Just take sensible precautions."
"Pia, I had no idea these mosquitos were also in the Bahamas. I thought I did my homework, but didn't see one post on that board about them. Thank you for making it clear. I will be more vigilant when we travel."

"They are not just in the Bahamas, they are in the US as well.I don't mean to be a jerk, but I am still at a loss as to why people are surprised that there are disease carrying mosquitoes in the tropics."
"People, you need to do your research! The message below has been the very prominent heading of the National Park Service website for over 9 months (we went in May and it was up months before that while we were doing our planning!) Always, always search for travel alerts regarding where you are intending to travel. All that said, a bottle of DEET will save you a lot of trouble and let you enjoy true paradise. Mosquito Borne DiseaseThere are two mosquito transmitted diseases (virus), Dengue, and Chikungunya Fever, now confirin in the Virgin Islands. For more information on the disease and it's prevention please take a look at this link. More »"
"If one is reconsidering going to the Caribbean because of this new-found knowledge you may also need to consider relocating. Check out the distribution map of the common carriers since it may soon be coming to a town near you.cdc.gov/chikungunya/…CHIKV_VectorControl.pdf From what I've heard from people that have gotten one or the other, if given a choice I'd take my chances with a case of the Chickungunya virus over Lyme's disease and so far that hasn't restricted my travel."
True!! Thanks all & some very good points being made.
thank you!
"Here is a recent article on St. John Source you can check out for more info: stjohnsource.com/content/news/local-news/201…The good news is that the cases in our area are declining. And here is a quote from the article in regards to informing the visiting public about the virus:""Tourism Department spokesman Luana Wheatley said the department’s airport greeters in June began passing out information to arriving visitors about the outbreak and how to protect against it. However, she said that all visitors may not have received the flyer because they opted not to accept it from the greeter."""
Great news! I honestly cant imagine vacationing anywhere else !! Thanks all !
"I agree with Stacy B., do your research on the places you're traveling to especially on the CDC website. Assume that tropical diseases will be present if you're traveling to those regions. My cousin and I took the precaution of always applying bug spray especially at night during our recent trip to St. John. I mentioned to her that it seems everyone's forgotten that Dengue Fever is around since Chikungunya hit the headlines. She joked that Chikungunya's so last season and it's the new Dengue. It was not said to diminish the seriousness of either tropical disease but said with concern that people forget there are other illnesses besides Chikungunya that can be contracted in the tropics. We were relieved that during the trip, only I got mosquito bites and only a few, at that. We were very concerned about both diseases and took the necessary precaution of applying bug spray. I feel for anyone who has gotten a mosquito-borne disease as the property manager of where we stayed was fighting Chikungunya while we were there :("
"You make a good point. All of this talk about Chikungunya and Dengue really isn't coming up that often. Neither virus is fun, but since Chhikungunya is new to this area, it has gotten a lot of press. Dengue has been here pretty much forever, and will likely always be here. And unlike Chikungunya, you can get it more than once, and there are different strains of it as well. So bug spray, keeping covered, keeping away from mosquitoes, is ALWAYS a good idea. It's best to just be informed the best as you can no matter where you travel. We have other things here that people may not know about as well, fire coral, sea urchins, jelly fish, christmas bush, etc…. So you should also not be touching things you know nothing about either. There are certain risks you take when you don't educate your self, and this thread is a great reminder to us all to do our homework."
