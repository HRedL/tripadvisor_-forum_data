"Can anyone advise on the status of the Chikungunya outbreak in French Polynesia? I did a web search, but there is nothing very specific. Would the end of October/beginning of November be a reasonably dry time in terms of mosquitos?I would greatly appreciate any info. or insight.Cheers,AG"
"According to French language news sources, the Chikungunya epidemic was officially declared over as of March 18, 2015. Here is part of the translated article:Source: tahiti-infos.com/Chikungu...e_a123441.html""For three weeks, the number of new cases of observed patients is less than 5 persons per 10 000. This criterion is accepted as the threshold end of epidemic. At the height of the crisis in late 2014, there could be up to 9,000 new cases per week. The virus remains ever present in French Polynesia. . . . In total, the chikungunya virus has been identified since mid-October, with more than 69,000 people who saw physicians for clinically suggestive cases, more than 25% of the Polynesian population.""The gist of the article is that the epidemic is over, but Chikungunya will always be present in FP. People will always be advised to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites and continue mosquito controls. Dengue is also present in FP.My take is that there aren't many tropical vacation places left in that don't have one of more of chikungunya, dengue, or malaria. If you have to eliminate chikungunya from your travel plans, you might want to go to Hawaii. Hawaii is one of the very few tropical vacation places that doesn't have chikungunya - yet. (Hawaii does have occasional problems with dengue.)As for me, I like tropical vacation places enough to take my chances. Fortunately, I am also blessed with a very good immune system.Source: http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/geo/index.html"
"Hi Bob734,Thanks for the helpful reply and link. I'm generally of a similar mind in terms of taking my chances, except when there is a full blown epidemic. Were you in FP during the epidemic?Cheers,AG"
"My wife and I were there in March/April 2014. The only mosquitoes I saw were on the Internet. My wife went on a hike in Moorea, but wore buggspray (the name of the repellent). Others on her hike were bothered by them, but she wasn't."
"No, we were not there during the epidemic (late 2014 - early 2015). We were in Moorea in November of 2013. We are going back this November for a two week trip.During our November 2013 visit to Moorea, the only place I remember seeing any mosquitoes is when we ate lunch at a cafe that was amongst lots of tropical vegetation."
"been using buggspray for years, it's the best (two g's). Buy the 4oz not the 3oz TSA size because it's just the same bottle re-labeled and doesn't fit well in the 3-1-1. I bring the sprayer empty and refil from a smaller 3oz bottle."
"We were there March 2014, and also March 2015. Will be back March 2016. Once they have had it, they are immune from getting it again. Most locals already had it by this point, but I suppose it is still possible some haven't. But dengue is possible anyway, like in many other tropical locals. We use bug spray liberally while there. However, these diseases are spreading to the US anyway, in Florida, now in California. I expect soon they will be all over. They are also in the Caribbean.Be smart about protection, because otherwise soon you wouldn't be able to go anywhere to vacation, and they will be at home too. We make sure to keep protected, and we do the same at home during summer.Edited: 4 years ago "
