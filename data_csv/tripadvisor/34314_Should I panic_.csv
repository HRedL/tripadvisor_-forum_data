"Before having a melt down, please consider doing the following:Check your own country’s consulate, government or foreign office web sites for their advice on countries/areas affected by the virus.Check the latest information from the health authorities of the country you are visiting.Do not pay too much attention to people who are intent on turning a crisis into a drama. You are an adult, do your research and make your decision accordingly."
"Answer to your questionNOGREEN YELLOWORANGERED It’s DORSCON ORANGE - it’s in control but spreading . Come here - you won’t be as carefree as you would be if you chose an uninflected holiday place RED means out of control - that’s when to panic. RUN!Imo - About 25% risk at each level. Do the math people.Edited: 2:54 pm, February 14, 2020 "
"I’m sorry Bill,but I don’t understand your reply. Could you explain in speak for an aged idiot like me please?"
"Hola Mr Spy, drama into crisis, I think you meant ;)"
"Sure and you’re not an idiot at all. Respect Answer - NO PANIC In Singapore, threat level set to ORANGE by government on a scale from GREEN to RED. At Red, whole country locked down, no in. No out.ORANGE means yes it’s serious. It is spreading. BUT IN CONTROL. Hence no panic.Edited: 3:02 pm, February 14, 2020 "

"""Should I Panic""?Of course not. And don't seek/take medical advice from strangers on public forums! :)"
"Red doesn't necessarily mean a total lockdown, see https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coron…Other changes are dependent on government decisions, for instance school closures have been discussed already, but nothing has been done, i.e. it's not part of the colour coding, see https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/healt…"
"Why only Singapore is using Dorscon? The rest avoiding to be transparent and informative....and so you have to read in between the lines and really decide for yourself.....Anyway, life as usual. Personal hygiene practices, be aware not panic. Booked a very nice hotel that I am interested in at a good deal rate for next week staycation (vacation in Singapore). Cheers!"
"I’m in Singapore at the moment.It is pleasantly quiet due to the reduced number of visitors.The place is perfectly calm, people going about their business as usual. Some face masks and temperature checks but not nearly as many as Bangkok.Good hand hygiene is all that is required."
"Thanks qualityspy1 for drafting this. Hopefully other travellers with read through and follow the steps to determine what course of action to take.BillUK, please no more wonky math and statistics. Escalation levels are not linear you know.Edited: 8:27 pm, February 14, 2020 "
"Great advice, qualityspy1! It's definitely more sound than unnecessary paranoia. ;)"
"#6I do stress there is NO NEED to PANIC.But in answer to your question Yes it may happen, CDC, say its rare but can. Other reports linked below corroborate.https://www.sciencealert.com/latest-coronavi…""The first US patient diagnosed with 2019-nCoV also experienced loose bowel movements for two days and the virus was subsequently detected in his stool, and there have been other such cases in China documented in the Lancet, albeit infrequently.""Importantly, 2019-nCoV has been reported elsewhere in the feces of patients with atypical abdominal symptoms, similar to SARS which was also shed in urine, suggesting a fecal transmission route which is highly transmissible,"" William Keevil, a professor of environmental healthcare at the University of Southampton said in a comment to the UK's Science Media Centre.""https:/…transmission.html""Human coronaviruses most commonly spread from an infected person to others throughthe air by coughing and sneezingclose personal contact, such as touching or shaking handstouching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your handsrarely, fecal contamination""Edited: 3:19 am, February 15, 2020 "
#6 felice giorno di San Valentino in ritardoThis was replied to upon your asking the same question #222https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowTopic-g29…Same question replied to #62https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowTopic-g29…I'll not be replying again if you ask again. Sorry. Suggest you also update yourself here on advisory from CDC - Centers from Disease Control and Preventionhttps:/…transmission.html
"I stand by my advice:1. No need to panic.2. If you have kids, consider delay. Its going to be a tough ask to control everything they touch.3. If you are coming heed the Government advice on measures per DORSCON Orange (this level was not raised lightly by Govt) to reduce risk of communal spread. I am no world expert on something i have less than 1 month of experience of. Noone here who has commented really is. Take it all with a pinch of salt if you want. Everyone has an opinion, you are free to choose whats right for you.Edited: 1:53 am, February 15, 2020 "
"Gosh ! I find it quite alarming , that I will not be allowed to leave Singapore , if while I am there , the authorities decide to move up the orange advisory to red . I am so looking forward to visiting beautiful Singapore and its ever so friendly people ."
"Hi Winston, fat chance of that. Very unlikely. Relax and enjoy. Travel safe."

"Reading the first reply, I did wonder why someone was giving an answer to a post that wasn't even a question. But alas, no forum thread (or review) is safe from billuk32's coronavirus related endeavours.Edited: 11:45 pm, February 16, 2020 "
"Hello AccidentalTourist,Firstly this is very sound advice given by QualitySpy1. Secondly, yes you're right, I'm sorry for being an idiot and rushing to reply to the headline at first without realising this was a rhetorical question, as confirmed post #18, but should have evident earlier. My bad.I would add some great advice can also be found here.Anyone who reads this in the future with any concerns - please review this thread.
