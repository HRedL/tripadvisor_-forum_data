"Because of the virus from wuhan, me and my plus are deciding to not go north of vietnam from da nang to be safe for the trip. our months of planning had be changed because of the outbreak,i was wondering where we could go in south of vietnam? we are been in nha trang and did most of the things there before."
"Well, given that the only know patients in Vietnam with Corona Virus are in Saigon and took a train from Nha Trang to Saigon, are you sure South is the way to go?https://www.travelfish.org/country/vietnam covers the highlights pretty well. Central Highlands, Mekong Delta, ...?"
"Isnt the virus only in Hanoi and da nang, I havent heard of any news about it in saigon. And i will check that site out!! Thank you"

It is early days yet and the virus could be in many places by the time you get there.
"Are you really sure you should be travelling at all, bearing in mind how concerned you are ?"
"""No Please it's sending me crazy.""It's unbelievable, isn't it, Annie.Apart from hoping / wanting to hear what they want to hear, I'm not sure l understand the point.Oh well, what can you do....Scott"
"ScottI wonder if everyone, will rush out and get the vaccine when it becomes available, yet lots don't bother with the flu and that killed way more people last year. Oh and we might as well add Dengue fever since there is no vaccine or cure for that. Annie."
"Scott you'll be pleased to know there are about 5 seperate posts on the virus in the Singapore forum, ..think they beat Vietnam...,"
Not for long :-)
"There have been about 25 duplicate virus threads on the Thailand TA forum,, including 1 prat who asked if it would be safe to travel in 4 months timeAnybody who is concerned enough to worry about it, should be staying at home"
"""There have been about 25 duplicate virus threads on the Thailand TA forum” They seem to be spreading like, well, a virus!"

"We are traveling to Vietnam in March ( Ho Chi Min, hoi Ann,, Hue and Hanoi). Keeping an open mind as we don’t know what is ahead regarding this virus. Currently, Vietnam has about the same number of cases as the US"
"""A contact within Chinese Emb has voiced that the deaths are in the thousands, we are not getting that info. Be sure before you scoff at others concerns."" Seriously? Spreading third party heresay like that helps in what what way exactly?"
"#10 ""I wonder if everyone, will rush out and get the vaccine when it becomes available, yet lots don't bother with the flu and that killed way more people last year.""I also find it funny that this is crowded with people frightened about a virus that has yet to kill 1 person in Vietnam and asking for strangers to advise them, and yet usually it's filled with people asking for illegal motorcycling tips as a tourist, and when it's pointed out about the thousands of deaths and severe injuries suffered each year that their travel insurance will not cover them for, these same advisors are Negative Nancy's getting hysterical out of something that will never happen to the asker. The human race is funny when it comes to assessing risk."

"In Saigon, all of patients have been discharged from the hospital. So it is safe to head to the North of Vietnam.Indochina Pioneer"
"Interestingly enough, our concern over our mid March trip to Vietnam is the brief stop in Seoul. Not catching the virus, but as South Korea cases explode, we have trouble getting back into the states as we connect in South Korea for the flight back to US. We stopover on our way for 3 hours in Seoul and an hour on the return."
"@Inspiration763922: Same with me. At this point my only concerns are my connecting flight to Hong Kong and my stopover in Bangkok should the situation change in either of those 2 places where I would be denied entry into Vietnam afterwards, especially since long-haul flights always leave me with my sinuses over-reacting. Also concerned about domestic flight cancellations.It's actually pretty funny that several relatives tried to pressure me into cancelling my Vietnam trip and go somewhere in Europe ""where it's safe"". but it's looking more possible that they might be way more dangerous. Just goes to show nobody can predict these things."
@kevin: I have the same problem with my sinuses! I will have to make sure I am well medicated so as not to be sneezing or congested as it will likely make me suspect. This trip is my husband’s trip of a lifetime. He travels for a living but has never been to Vietnam. Likely will go but I need to understand the re-entry protocols for US
"@ Inspiration, I too have the same symptoms for years like the coronavirus! And have not been able to find a cure so far. I was thinking maybe I could volunteer for research on this virus and with any luck they could find a cure for me.In any case I am supposed to fly for March 15th with a connecting flight out of South Korea which has 1100 related cases so far and climbing. They have already banned some flights from Korea to Vietnam and most likely I will at the least have to change my flight. I believe it is unlikely that I will catch the virus, The problem is flying so far and not be allowing into the country. Or a possible 14 day quarantined which would be dreadful! Just heard that U.S. airlines are giving full refunds for flights to Korea. Hope Canada follows soon as I will have to take them up on that offer.I just can't see myself in a country with very similar symptoms and everyone running away from me. LOL, how bad would that be. With my luck they would lock me up for 14 days or more."
Any information on river cruises from Emerald/Scenic being cancelled for March? Please advise if refunds were offered. Currently scheduled 21 day Cambodia to Vietnam for April 1.
I'm planning on going early April. Wow.....I'm getting no clarity on whether or not to cancel or not!!!
Any information on river cruises from Emerald/Scenic being cancelled for March? March is a few days away why don't you ring the company you'll know for sure rather than someone here guessing.
We are due to go with Emerald on 1st March. They advise trip is going ahead as per itinerary and they are following Government advice and monitoring closely . Customer Services seemed quite reluctant to discuss it.
"Travelling in March, with Emerald no cancelation, no offer of refunds and no offer of alternative dates ."
"We are also travelling on Emerald cruise in March. Received an email yesterday from them: ""Based on the current situation and in line with Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) recommendations our Emerald Waterways team in Southeast Asia is conducting pre-boarding screening, including, but not limited to, guest questionnaires on wellbeing and travel arrangements, and passport checks. We will also deny boarding to any guest or crew who has travelled from or through mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau in the last 14 days. Both the Vietnam and Cambodian governments have also implemented a number of enhanced screening procedures ensuring our guest and staff health and safety is our top priority"". We still plan to go unless we are told we can't!"
"Sounds like Emerald is doing a good job as are other govt departments, tour operators, airlines etc here."
"Newspaper Courrier du Vietnam of 28 February (my translation) :The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC) has decided to remove Vietnam from its list of countries presenting a risk, saluting the efficient fight of the country against the epidemic of the new coronavirus (COVID-19)."
"""Newspaper Courrier du Vietnam of 28 February (my translation) :""Keep fighting the good fight, Jack.And keep missing the point on what most of these corona virus threads are actually about.Seriously....Scott"
"My mistake, I thought all those threads were about Corona, ans so his my last one. Seriously, you are really obnoxious with your nasty comments and your constant sarcasms ; I have NO order to receive from somebody like you !!! LEAVE ME ALONE !Edited: 11:36 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"Sorry you found my comment nasty, Jack.But I'm more sorry you felt the need to dig up every single corona thread and copy and paste 'your' translation of some such 'link'.But then again, you have a personal reason to encourage people to visit Vietnam.Just hope they can all get home without being quarantined during the process.....Scott"
You have something against informing everybody possible ? That's shows who you really are !!!!
"hi, we are booked for the exact same 21 days cruise as you on April 01. we will be flying from Vancouver, BC. just received an email from Emerald waterways today to have our flights changed to transfer in Taiwan. ( previously booked to transfer in HongKong).as far as we know, the trip is still on."
We have postponed our trip to Nov 11. It cost us because the trip was more expensive and we had to upgrade our cabin to category A from B. Haven’t booked flights yet but expect little or no additional costs.Have fun.
"So. Our return flight has been changed from what was a 1 hour layover to what will end up bring an 8 hour layover in Seoul. Our outbound , which was a 3 hour stopover is now a 14 hour stopover. I have to read the notice again but I’m pretty sure we are subject to a quarantine since we are coming out of Seoul. If our arrangements had not changed I would still be packing and planning. As it is, we will cancel. my husband and I got I the cancel for any reason insurance coverage ( learned my lesson several years ago flying without travel insurance) so we will try again next year perhaps. Outr travel companions did NOT get insurance and they will take the loss. Such a shame"
"No one should travel any where without insurance ,,that's asking for trouble"
".....Totally agree Annie........BUT I have contacted our travel insurance this morning (as we are going to Vietnam for 4 weeks in June( just to ask the question if we have to cancel our trip what are we covered for....their answer ABSOLUTELY nothing as they have a ""Clause"" that says does not cover epidemic/pandemic!So if we choose not to go (which is highly unlikely) we will loose our airfares and accommodation which is already paid for. I'm not booking anything else at this stage.Truly unfair I believe!"
"parkers Yes I knew travel insurance doesn't cover a pandemic or epidemic, I meant travel in general for medical loss of baggage etc.."
".....and also i forgot to mention that if we did contract the virus we are not covered for medical expenses, extra delays in travel etc.So i beg to ask the question....why bother with travel insurance when we can claim so little, when you actually need it!!! CRAZY!!!"
"""Yes I knew travel insurance doesn't cover a pandemic or epidemic"" That is actually not true. Many policies will cover losses resulting form such events. It does vary both by the country in which the policy was issued and the insurance company concerned. Don’t just take the word of a call centre operative, they are not always known for the accuracy of the information they give out. Always check the terms and conditions, preferable before purchase. A Q&A produced by the Association of British Insurers @ https:/…Few policies will cover you if you just don’t want to go. Many, will cover losses in the event of a government advisory NOT to travel or where you need to be repatriated whilst abroad, at least for policies taken out in the U.K. and EU"
The policies Ive seen in Australia may help you if you took the policy out before an epidemic/pandemic was called. Others are point blank refusing to pay for anything.

"CrellstonA typical example my yoga teacher was due to fly out to Singapore and Japan on Friday. Since they have quite a few cases she has cancelled, for fear of getting back into Australia she was going for a month,.,now she's with Singapore airlines they will allow her to change her dates. No problem, but the hiking tour she was going to do in the mountains of Japan somewhere, she has lost all her money. And also some of the cost of the hotel. Taking out insurance under normal circumstances is imperative, it's not every year we are faced with a pandemic, so for the majority of Aussies their insurance won't cough up, you can buy insurance for it, but most don't as it's such a rare occurrence, .."
"Allianz has a notification that their policies DO NOT cover epidemics. I saw that on my original policy when it was issued but did not focus on it as we purchased our trip from go today travel in November, well before corona hit. I always buy cancel for any reason but I think it is abhorrent that travel companies are not obligated to refund some of your money if the us state Dept advises to not travel to a region for health or safety reasons to a destination that , upon booking , had a travel advisories level of 1, or no restrictions"
