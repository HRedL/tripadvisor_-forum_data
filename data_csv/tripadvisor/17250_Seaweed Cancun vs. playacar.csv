Booked a flight to Cancun for November 2018. Which area is less affected by the seaweed epidemic - hotel zone in Cancun or playacar? Deciding where to stay.
"Playacar is not looking well re.sargassum at the moment. However, all bets are off when it comes to 4 months from now. There is a new page on facebook dedicated to sargassum. Webcamsdemexico.com has pictures of the beaches in Cancun. Tellingly, the Playa del Carmen beach webcam has been turned off for awhile."
"I expect for the area to be clear by November when I am going back. Reports say it will start breaking up in August. Cancun beaches are prettier if that is what you are looking for, and the Northern Islas Mujeres side has calm crystal clear blue water while the Eastern Shores have the waves that alot of people may like. I like the diversity of the beaches in Cancun but not so much the town. PDC is much more fun to walk around 5th avenue at night and has more options for food and bars."
"I’m here now and the seaweed wasn’t an issue at all! One day it wasn’t great, but the Riu Palace México, where I stayed, did an amazing job of removing it. The rest of the week, the beach was clear and beautiful! Don’t let this stop you from coming to Playa Del Carmen.Edited: 1 year ago "
Was there 3 weeks ago. Cancun hotel zone was gorgeous and 90% seaweed free. We drove to PDC a couple of days and it was still there and the water was brown in spots. People were in the ocean but I personally wouldn’t get in there. Have you looked on the webcams? That would be helpful in making your decision
"I wonder if anyone knows whether the seaweed is still making playa del carmen a little messier than Cancun beaches, now in December? We're heading there next month and wondering if we should just get a hotel in Cancun to get the better beach/water."
We're in Playacar now. The past two weeks there was one day of seaweed that kept us out of sea. The rest of the time there has been little to no seaweed in the water.The wind and waves have been a bigger problem but nothing out of the ordinary for December.Sorry we don't know anything about Cancun conditions.
Thank you!
