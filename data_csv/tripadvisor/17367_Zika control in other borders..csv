"Hello,I'm planning a trip to Europe, and I already have my ticket which departs from Sao Paulo to Roma. I'm not from Brazil, and I wanted to spend a few days in Rio, but with the Zika issue right now, I don't know if it's a good idea. I don't really care about the mosquito itself, I want to know your thoughts about immigration in Europe regarding this problem; do you think it'll matter if I stay there for a week or just a day?Thanks so much"
"A few days in Rio (and Rome) is a good idea if you know how to protect yourself from mosquitoes:Mosquitoes that spread Zika virus may be more likely to bite during daytime hours.Apply insect repellents and reapply as directed. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants and tuck your pants into your socks when outdoors.Wear light-colored clothing, since mosquitos are thought to be more attracted to darker colors.Avoid the use of scented skin care products.Stay in places with air conditioning or that use window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside."
Maybe you should post a question in the Italy forum.
"as of now, there are no travel restrictions for anyone living/having visited places where there are reported zika cases.this is the World Health Organization statement on the issue:""Based on available evidence, WHO is not recommending any travel or trade restrictions related to Zika virus disease. As a precautionary measure, some national governments have made public health and travel recommendations to their own populations, based on their assessments of the available evidence and local risk factors.""http://who.int/features/qa/zika/en/furthermore, i see that you live in Argentina... there have already been confirmed cases of zika in Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia, neighbors of Argentina (as well as about 20 countries/territories in the Americas... see list in link below)... …europa.eu/en/…unfortunately, there are confirmed dengue cases in Argentina and it may be a matter of time before zika shows up in Argentina too (since it is the same mosquito that can carry dengue, zika, chikungunya, yellow fever virus).…mercopress.com/2016/01/22/argentina-admits-…the only countries in the Americas which are not expected to have autochthonous zika cases are Canada and Chile.if you are concerned about having a Brazil stamp in your passport, you could always enter Brazil with only your DNI (in good state; usually not issued more than 10 years ago)... Mercosul (and most other South American) citizens do not need a passport to enter Brazil."
"Sincerely, immigration in Europe is very simple and hassle free...There is no concrete evidence that zica can be transmitted from person to person and the virus epidemic is concentrated in Northeastern Brazil."
