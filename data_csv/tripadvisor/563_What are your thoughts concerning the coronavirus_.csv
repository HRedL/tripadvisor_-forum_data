"Considering the huge numbers of Chinese tourists that come to Japan, friends and relatives are telling me we should cancel our trip. They aren’t the ones who have spent so much time and money planning this trip of a lifetime so it is easy for them to say. Truth is though, I am getting nervous. I know tour groups are not allowed to travel out of China now but I also read many are finding ways out regardless. I am anxious to hear what others in the same situation are thinking. Thank you."
"We’ll be in Japan in a few weeks. It hasn’t even crossed my mind to change our plans. Why would we? I probably have a much greater chance of being struck by lightning when I step out the door tomorrow than I have of getting the coronavirus from some random Chinese tourist in Japan. In any event, we generally avoid all those “must see” sites where the tourist hordes are wall-to-wall in favour of the many other equally worthy sites."
I think it is easier to meet an earthquake than coronavirus in Japan
"Guess US has not issued any travel warnings to Japan yet. If not, just exercise more vigilance on personal hygiene such as wearing masks etc. I'll be skiing in Japan (annually) in a few weeks also meeting local friends in Tokyo.also visiting Okinawa in mid-March.Edited: 5:19 am, January 28, 2020 "
"It’s best to keep well informed from the proper sources, not the media and here on travel forums with many panic comments and also badly informed people who may support either it is safe to go or not safe depending on how much they have prepared and invested to go on holiday to places to not spoil their plans.The authoritative information source one needs to keep a daily read of the situation is here https:/…advice-for-public And here https:/…novel-coronavirus-2019 if you read the country specific updates Japan still does not have that many cases compared to China, about the same as USA and Australia all have good health infection control systems to manage it.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Our flights are in early May. Prayers that it does down by then and didn’t escalate. Safe travels everyone!
"May trip gives you plenty of time to see how this situation unfolds and cancel travel plans if needed. As mentioned keep a frequent watch on the above WHO information links country situation reports, travel advisory https:/…novel-coronavirus-2019 and your own government travel information.It’s also currently predicted a vaccine may be developed in 3 months so ask your family doctor and other health information sources in your country near to the trip."
"On this subject I have heard that a new law is being put in place that anyone coughing or sneezing MUST wear a mask. Does anyone know if this is true? And if so where would I get one? I'm landing on Haneda, Tokyo.Thanks"
I doubt about that fake news but you can buy masks at convenience stores and drug stores.It would be good to wear one to prevent flu too.
"Is this an unconfirmed media rumour to wear mask if coughing or sneezing, it does not appear on any internet search reports. Where is your source of information?There are many pharmacy and normal shops to buy masks or take one with you from home.Edited: 8:36 am, January 28, 2020 "

"Hi, I'm about to plan a visit to Japan in this end of June to July.But today's news about Japan local to local spreading holds me back...I really worry if I pay for flight and hotel, then end up have to waste the money...As this budget is using years to accumulated....Thanks for the post, reading and hoping u update here once u decide any."
"Also remember that if you are a healthy person and practicing good hygiene you really do not have to worry too much. The ones that may need to cancel trips are the older, younger or immune deficient people. Just to put into perspective (and not trying to be glib), China has reported 81 deaths per their huge population, assuming that they are under reporting a considerable amount, lets say 500, so far the flu in the USA has caused over 2100 deaths this winter season."
"We are planning on going back to Tokyo for a week in July (before the Olympics) on our way to Mongolia. We have not made any reservations yet since we are waiting for our hosts in Mongolia to finalized the trip details. The coronavirus has not even crossed our minds. We were in Tokyo over Christmas and New Years and yes, there were a lot of Chinese tourists there at the time. We will not make our final arrangements until late February so we will keep an eye on this situation. So far, there are 5 cases in the US (2 in California) and all of these people (as I read in local articles) visited Wuhan, China recently."
"Hi - I'm doing the same. My main worry is that I am connecting in mainland China on the way and believe that I may invalidate my insurance for the entire trip if I do so (and if I book accommodation knowing the travel advice, which I've not yet done)."
I have asked my insurer and am awaiting their response. The insurance documentation does not differentiate between transiting somewhere and staying there.
I leave in two days for Japan....not even vaguely thinking to cancel....more flu here in the US....
"WHO current situation report is 4593 cases, 106 deaths, 56 cases outside China up from 39 last report so increasing much at the moment. Still no reason to panic for Japan.The 2003 SARS event resulted in about 8000 cases and ending in 2004 so let’s hope it is similar and China is more prepared and Corona is less extensive."
We will be in Japan in a few weeks. It going to cancel. As stupid as it will look we will wear a mask on the plane and on trains and places that are crowded. Make sure we use hand sanitizer and that's about it. I always use sanitizer when travelling so no big change.
I am planning to go Australia on 12th of Feb. Via kaulalampur any Corona virus effect is there for Australia tour.
"#22 only westerners think wearing mask looks stupid, while Asians wear them on regular basis in Japan etc so you will be fine and fit in."
"Be sure to wash your hands often, especially after returning ""home"" (hotel) and touching a part of your face, ie eyes and mouth. In Japan, everyone has a habit of doing that and gargling since childhood, so it's a no-brainer. Masks are sold everywhere, even in convenience stores at the train stations. Comes in Small and Large. Sometimes, one size fits all. Masks actually keep you warm in the winter. It also keeps your throat hydrated. Great for planes. And trains. SARS and MARS died out in about 8 months. Corona virus started making the news in December, so that means August.....maybe? But the specialists have been saying, usually, viruses die from the heat. Tokyo WILL be hot.... in time. (We're having freak weather and it was 15C today! They're forecasting ""winter"" to finally come from Feb. 1. Finally, snow for the ski resorts!) News today said Australian scientists are close to discovering a vaccine for the C-virus. Fingers crossed! United and several other airlines are stopping their China routes for now as demand is low. Better check with your airline."
are people generally wearing masks in public spaces in Japanese cities these days?
">> Masks are sold everywhere, even in convenience stores at the train stations. Comes in Small and Large. Sometimes, one size fits all. You have to buy the proper ones... ones that are not meant for hay fever / allergy. >> are people generally wearing masks in public spaces in Japanese cities these days?They have been doing that for decades.

"I do believe the media has encouraged unnecessary hysteria, as they did with Zika and Ebola which has little effect on most countries besides where they originated. There was hysteria in Australia, America and other countries and yet it has had little to no impact on us. The media loves a good, dramatic headlines - always has. Whilst I can understand it has a significant impact on China, I don't believe the rest of the world has equal cause for alarm rather than being cautious and putting the appropriate actions in place. It is worth noting many of the deaths thus far have either been people of older age, those already vulnerable or with compromised immune systems - this is atypical of viruses and even the common cold or flu can cause death in vulnerable persons. Yes, there are a few cases of coronavirus in the US, Europe, Australia, and Japan. But I personally won't be cancelling my travel plans. Measles, flus, colds, gastro and other viruses also have the potential to kill or cause very nasty symptoms but they have not caused such hysteria. We do not let the presence of them stop us leaving the house. The flu itself has caused thousands of death - but still, we let life go on and stick to our plans. Practice good hygiene, do not touch your face, especially the hands and mouth, ensure all foods are cooked fully, avoid livestock markets, wear a mask (if necessary) and you should be fine. The same precautions anyone should already be taking, as usual."
"There are lots of unknowns.As of now, if one is exposed to confirmed patients (sitting close to one on the plane, staying in the same hotel...), you could be quarantined for 14 days, possibly in a foreign country."
#26 it's been a common practice to wear face masks for decades in Asia to wear one when you're sick or trying not to get sick. Absolutely no one thinks they are silly to wear. If anything you will be frowned upon if you even sneeze or cough without one on.
"I agree. Even experts don't know much about this new coronavirus. If I were you, op, I wouldn't worry about it since your trip is not until May. Come April and if there were many coronavirus patients in Japan (highly doubtful) think about canceling then. No sense worrying about it now."
Im starting to get concerned our trip is in May. My husband is immune suppressed :(. We booked with miles and we could cancel.
"Your husband is on immunosuppressants if I remember correctly. He has a legitimate reason to be concerned. But again, it's too early to think about cancelling, IMO."
"I’ve booked all my hotels on flexi rates to be safe, so I can cancel without fee if needed. I’m flying ANA Business which I think allows you to refund with a $200 fee - I should be able to recover the $200 loss from Travel Insurance. I suppose my advice to anyone who wants to travel but is concerned would be to book flexible hotels and flights, if you don’t mind spending extra. It gives you some ease of mind, I suppose.If flexible hotels and flights are too costly for your chosen brand/s, research Travel Insurance with the best coverage.But honestly... I think all should be fine although if someone is elderly, or has a vulnerable immune system or pre-existing illness, then they should reconsider travel, of course. That’s my view. There are no warnings against travel at this time - only to China."
We are not making any decision for a while. He does take immunosuppressents which makes it riskier for him. Our biggest restriction with travel has always been yellow fever zones as the vaccine is live. We are hoping its cleared up by May.At least for us our only cost that is not refundable is a redposit fee for our miles.
"My not-yet-booked trip to Japan - would've been for February - is on hold until I get a better idea of how serious this will be. It should be a lot clearer in the next week.I'm not so much worried personally - my immunity is strong - but everything around us could be breaking down. No food in shops, airlines bankrupt, use your imagination..."
"""Also remember that if you are a healthy person and practicing good hygiene you really do not have to worry too much. The ones that may need to cancel trips are the older, younger or immune deficient people."" - this is inaccurate information. Healthy people have died from the virus to suggest that if you are healthy then you don't have to worry is extremely misleading,"
"In terms of Japan I understand your concern because there are a lot of Chinese visitors to there and there have been some confirmed cases in Japan as a result, but it has not spread in Japan to the point where I would cancel a trip there. The Japanese government and healthcare system is more reliable then some other countries in the region, so I think they are likely going to be able to curtail the impact on their country. Just monitor the situation, but I know if I had a trip scheduled for Japan right now I would feel comfortable going still compared to some other countries in Asia."
@ViajeroPerdido - really? - you do not need disease to spread that kind of FUD.
We have our tickets booked for 20th of March and will be in Tokyo for 10 days. Flying Cathay Pacific from Dubai via Hong Kong. Until now fully committed to go as per the plan. Will keep a watch on proceedings in the coming days.
"We’re booked to fly to Tokyo on March 1st. I think it will be ok but I’m more worried day by day, to be honest. It’s hard not to be with it in the news everywhere!"
"I'm traveling April 26 for 8 days in Tokyo. I'm not planning on canceling right now. I'll be monitoring situation though.It seems to me that countries like Japan, with a deeply ingrained hygiene culture might be able to curtail the spread a little easier than some other countries. We traveled there last May and even then (no virus outbreaks, etc) we were health screened upon entry along with everyone else. I think Japan has fewer entry points than China, maybe allowing the country to be more effective at curtailing quicker as well.From what I see, I think there's less than 10 cases in Japan right now, and 1 has recovered so far. That's significant to me, esp with the number of Chinese tourists that flood the country."
"ViajeroPerdido - best hide in a shelter now. And don't come out. You know, just in case the entire world comes into meltdown."
I am encouraged reading some of the comments. Although we are healthy and are always mindful to wash and sanitize our hands. we are seniors in our 70’s. So the elderly seem to be warned more than others. I hope we keep this thread alive as my mind is eased by what the local people have to say. Thank you!
"We came back from Japan just over a week ago when the news of the virus was just breaking and did notice a few warnings and checkpoints at the airport. Whether these spare just general warnings about travellers with fevers or a response to this outbreak I know not.What I did notice was the massive increase in Chinese tour groups from our previous visit in 2008. Even in what is supposed to be the quiet season it was very crowded,uncomfortably so at some of the sights in Kyoto. We used the subway and trains in both Tokyo and Kyoto and so missed most of the Chinese in transit as they were in tour buses.I tend to take a contrary approach to these things and would view it as an opportunity to bag some cheap flights and visit at a time which is less crowded. If I could I would return in a heartbeat.Not trying to understate the serious ness of the situation, but a reality check is needed by some as to the actual risk involved. It is not Ebola. That said, if I was in any way immuno- deficient say through age, a medical condition or chemotherapy, I would almost certainly feel differently.Social media and indeed the mainstream media, has tendency to overstate these issues which in turn causes overreaction and even panic."
"Yes, good to hear you're encouraged. I don't think playing down the seriousness of a viral spread is proper, but you do need to be careful of media hype, conventional and social. I'd just keep plans for now while being cognizant of your own health situation and monitoring the realities while ignoring hype, as much as is possible. I think it that it can take months to completely curtail an outbreak, but I'd have to imagine that Japan and other Chinese neighbors are doing all they can to stop it now. It also seems to me that unlike what was the case with SARS, I think which took a number of months to curtail, China has swooped into action far faster than SARS.Precautionary measures while on a trip like hand sanitizer, sanitizing wipes, etc can go a long way."
"I have a trip upcoming in mid June. I am still quite worried knowing there are a lot chinese tourists that could spread viruses.A friend working at a hotel with many chinese visitors are wearing face masks along with the other staff. I dont want to blame chinese people though. I guess it is like many other deseases, it spreads from people prior to symptoms developing.Though if going to Japan having to exert caution around lots of people, then I would rather postpone the trip.."
"Question to the locals, do you see a rise in anti-chinese sentiment in Japan due to this virus? I am an HKer Chinese but live in Canada. My family including my in-laws and two kids are planning on go to Tokyo in late Feb for 10 days. I still have another week and a half before the hotels become nonrefundable, the tentative plan is still to go....This will not be my first time to Japan and I know Japanese are one of the nicest and polite people in the world. However, in sensitive time like this, I won't be surprised if there's any racial profiling (it's an unfortunate fact in any part of the world)...."
"""This will not be my first time to Japan and I know Japanese are one of the nicest and polite people in the world."" - This is merely a stereotype. The cultural politeness does not somehow make them the nicest people in the world. I love Japan but a lot of tourists really simplify the culture with these kind of stereotypes and the truth is much more complicated. In terms of profiling Chinese people I'm sure that is happening all over the world and it will likely happen in Japan but just be more subtle. Doesn't mean people dislike the Chinese or bear them ill will its just fear of maybe catching something. Also, people are different so some people may be a bit more reluctant to interact with chinese people and others will continue on as normal.Edited: 6:07 pm, January 30, 2020 "
"Latest WHO figures 7818 confirmed cases, 170 deaths, 82 outside China, so about 2% death rate, 1% of cases outside China. https:/…novel-coronavirus-2019"
"Latest figures I see are: There are currently 9,171 confirmed cases worldwide, including 213 fatalities.9,042 of the cases are in China."
"WHO just declared it a Global Emergency, from the news this morning. Japan has said it will be implementing stricter action including compulsory quarantine, enhanced screening at airports etc.I suppose the risk to travellers is if you have even the slightest fever or cough, you’ll be quarantined.I didn’t think it would escalate this far. I hope ANA gives me a decent refund if I need to cancel before June."
Saw on news Chinese tour groups have been banned going anywhere by Chinese govt. Nothing to stop them going on their own though. Horrible situation to be in. My sister in law is from Singapore and currently they are skiing in Japan. While I understand people may be wary no need to be nasty.
"Latest news (Jan 31), Japan is banning all tourists from Wuhan and its province from entering the country. There's no restriction for someone from Singapore. Airlines are picking and choosing they're destinations. ANA has stopped all their flights to Wuhan from now until the end of February."
"The current number of cases in Japan compared to the global total, 1% outside of China, and Japans cases represent about 0.17% so still very low but can increase. 2% fatal.The concern compared to the last 2003 SARS epidemic at the end a total of about 8000 cases then but 9% fatal, is that in a space of only 1-2 months Corona has reached that of SARS in 6-12 months. Speculation is that Corona spread may extend for at least 6 months more, unless there is significant halt it may increase exponentially 3-5+ fold (25000 - 40000+ personal speculation). Even so Japan with its top health system and measures is in a very good position to handle this and the above current 0.17% of global cases in Japan might remain proportional so with in increase from current 11 cases to say around 33-55+ assuming correct."
Given the rapid development I am becoming more concerned with my transit in Shanghai. Still waiting to hear from my insurer at the moment but with many airlines already cancelling all flights to mainland China this could be a bit of an issue from my perspective. Other routings are significantly costly.
"Most people (here in Australia) are classed as ‘stable’ despite positively testing for the coronavirus. I am confident that Japan, like Australia, also has good medical facilities to handle this virus and minimise the risk of death. I believe one person in an Australian hospital has been released, with fine recovery. My concern isn’t risk to my health - I’m young, healthy and take good precaution in hygiene and supplements. My concern is being quarantined if someone near me on the flight is found ill. That, obviously, would be a holiday ruined lol. I still think the only time I’d cancel is if my government strictly says no travel to Japan, or if infections exceed a ridiculous number in Japan. Japan is a large country and you need to be realistic and consider the chance of physically being near one of those persons with coronavirus. You can reduce your risk by avoiding tourist buses, public transport and standing amongst congested crowds. Wear a mask. Wash your hands. Bring hand sanitizer and alcohol wipes. You could purchase sanitising wipes for any cutlery or glasses. Travel by taxi, if you can, or private transfers if affordable. That’s my battle plan.Go to attractions on days or times when crowds will be less, if possible.Luckily I mainly eat vegetarian so the risk of disease from meat is minimised. Also stuff like ramen is boiled/cooked at high temperature so that’s good at killing any bacteria, generally. I think my point is... it would be sad to cancel a holiday simply due to hysteria when you can just practice caution.But just my opinion, of course."
"#57 all good points, agreed the main issue will be potential disruptions and not merely the very low chance of infection outside of China. On the meat eating issue it has not been report officially that eating normal meat (beef, pork, chicken, seafood etc) and cooked (what about sushi?) carries the virus, except for bats/bat eating snakes found in China animal markets is at all an issue.Latest WHO official update is 9826 confirmed global cases, 213 deaths (all inside China), 106 outside of China so the percentages are still the same with 1% outside of China and 2% death rate. The previous WHO update a day before was about 7800 and this latest one is approx 1000 more, 6 days ago the figure was around 2800 cases, now a 3 fold increase in only a week, very rapid. However, keep these numbers in perspective as 650,000 people die globally from normal flu and related complications.The link for latest WHO cases is here for verification https:/…If anyone has issues or different numbers with the above please provide a reliable source link, not merely a media reference unless it is referenced properly."

"#59 the risk according to current date figures is very very low.

"I'm going to be in Japan for 3 weeks from the end of March. Based on the current information, I won't be cancelling my trip. The number of cases of the virus in Japan is so small as a proportion of the population that I calculate my chances of infection as basically zero. I'm more likely to choke to death by gulping yummy sushi too quickly.If anything dramatically changes, here in Australia (where we also have confirmed cases) or in Japan, of course I'll rethink my optimism. But at the moment I can't see the need for anything other than regular cold/flu hygiene practices."

I've read since this virus has been classified an ""infectious disease"", if you show signs of the virus, it can be an automatic 14 day mandatory hospitalization.

"OP I guess the bright side so far is that so many people are canceling their trips so it’ll be less crowded if you decide to come. A sort of panic-mode is starting to set in a little and it’s a bit like the SARS outbreak in 2003 in that respect with the rush on stores for face masks. The shelves are empty in my area. It was just business as usual a few days ago and then a noticeable change after Kyōto got its first case confirmed. I have friends heading to Fushimi Inari Shrine right now and they will let me know what it’s like there. For people coming in March, I’d still wait to cancel. Just see how it goes."
"I’m very interested to see a response to #66, if anyone has an official report/policy source. I’ll be leaving Australia in the midst of our flu/cold season and I’d hate to run into trouble in Japan if I arrive with a bit of a cough/runny nose. How absurd to face compulsory quarantine because you have a bit of a fever. Surely not?Anything can cause a fever not only colds/flus.If they introduce compulsory quarantine, I wouldn’t be surprised if holiday cancellations increase even further.@66 - I read any passengers sitting two rows in front or behind of infected passengers were facing compulsory quarantine.

"""I’ll be leaving Australia in the midst of our flu/cold season and I’d hate to run into trouble in Japan if I arrive with a bit of a cough/runny nose. "" I doubt it. If you were coming from China then there is a very high chance you would be thrown into isolation, but I doubt they would take such a step for someone coming from Australia when the numbers there are quite low, unless they have reason to think you have been interacting with people that have recently been in China."
">>Can a local please clarify the current policies for Americans arriving in Tokyo? I've read since this virus has been classified an ""infectious disease"", if you show signs of the virus, it can be an automatic 14 day mandatory hospitalization.<<If you test positive for coronavirus, of course they'll guarantee you. But just calm down and think about the chances of you in the US getting this virus. There are only 8 people who are positive for this virus in the whole USA. In addition, the US suspended the entry of Chinese national, so the virus is not likely to spread much. The chances of your getting hit by a bus is much higher."
"Many patients have asked me about coronavirus and they're concerned, but nobody worries about the flu, and some of them haven't had the flu vaccine. Just think about it. 8 people positive for coronavirus and none of them have died, but more than 8,000 people have died of flu in the US in 2019. Be logical!"
True. My visitor last weekend was coughing and said it was just a cold but then texted me on Monday... influenza A type and on Tamiflu now. :(I took the painful influenza test on Friday evening. Influenza is more of a threat than corona right now.
"I share the same sentiments as #66 and #68.I don’t read too much into the statistcs and infer probability of a hit.I am more concerned about the stricter SOP at point of enrty/exit. I read that Japan has invoked a stricter law that gives it more power to mandate tests?If i am detected with fever orrunny nose or teary eyes and deemed unwell, will i be mandated to be tested or even quarantined? What about at point of exit? If i have these symptoms, will i be stopped for tests or barred from boarding? What about after arrival, and you have traveled far away from Tokyo, but you so happened to have sat close to someone on the plane but have now tested positive, will they call you back for testing? I know these may be slim chances but just want some clarity on the procedures to better decide. These things can disrupt your holiday.To cancel or not is always a subjective decision depending on individual risk profiles, costs of cancellations and how much you have wanted this trip. For someone who had planned for this a long time, a first trip, chance of a lifetime, it maybe harder to give up than someone who makes frequent trips to japan and Cancelling means just a matter of months and he would be back again."
"Dr Shibuyakko ""Many patients have asked me about coronavirus and they're concerned.""Ask them if they've vaccinated their children against measles, mumps etc. If they haven't, tell them they're going to die, horribly. Serves them right.ps: this is why I'd make a terrible doctor. :)"

"#64 >>Let me preface this: I don't mean to challenge Ali0211, so people don't get me wrong.Now the total number of the cases has hit the 5digit mark, it's around time this was updated<<With greatest of respect your comments only refer to small unconfirmed, fear and emotional issues that do not reflect the wider situation based on the current information we have. For example, it is no use blaming WHO for not being strong enough declaring sooner the emergency. Their video media response praises China for actions they are taking but one can see they are relying on China to cooperate and encourage them at the same time. China currently has 99% of the world reported infection cases and has its hands are very full, behind the scenes their government very likely concerned for their own survival if they fail politically.Australia’s decision to quarantine people on Christmas Island, which is an infamous place used for illegally detaining refugees, which does not have proper medical facilities to treat people, 400km from Indonesia and 2500km from Australia is very questionable. It is potentially laced with racism as most of the people quarantined are of Chinese heritage and it knows this would win political support from the majority of non Asian Heritage Australian population. It is not an example to follow.On the China forum one poster described the Corona risk in Hong Kong at 1:500,000 people and Shenzhen 1:125,000 which are all much less than traffic accidents below. The Japan risk is 1:7500,000 people incredibly much lower because only 17 people infected despite so many Chinese tourists.To further put risk into proper perspective with current information here are the world road traffic incidents with 1.3 million deaths annually and 50 million injuries https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_coun…For those tuning in and not aware the current infection cases are WHO global offical figures one day old 11953 cases, 132 cases outside China, 259 deaths vs last report of 9826 cases.

These powers are what are needed to save the human race and innocent people over the rights of individuals, the good of the many over the few.It depends on how long your holiday is if you can absorb 3 days delay or they find nothing in the test result.Edited: 7:35 am, February 02, 2020 "
"This coronavirus will not be a problem when it gets warm in June, as SARS, and I hope it will be over earlier in April. Also, an important news came out from Thailand that antiviral drug combination of the anti-flu drug, oseltamivir, and the anti-HIV drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir, showed apparent treatment success against this coronavirus, as follows.https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asi…https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general…Since these drugs can now be used in most countries, as a physician and a researcher in clinical medicine, I strongly hope an effective treatment against this virus to be established soon."
"#84 I do hope that’s true, I’ll be heading off around June! But of course it’s Winter here in Australia so I hope I don’t get on the plane with a cough or Japan might throw me in hospital lol :| Vitamin C time!!"
The WHO precautions are here https:/…advice-for-publicVitamin C has slight affect to reduce colds among normal population https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10796569
"#86 Usually very true but I do find a combination of Vitamin C, Zinc and Garlic tablets do work quite well for reducing cold symptoms. That, and plenty of rest and water. I certainly wouldn’t suggest they’re much use against a serious virus or advanced flu.Just making a lighthearted comment about hopefully not turning up to Japan with any symptoms since they’re being strict against anyone.Edited: 12:11 am, February 03, 2020 "
"We have a trip coming up in about 4 days for 2 weeks, everyone think that it is still okay to go? Looks like things have still have stayed about the same as far as the virus goes in Tokyo, so I feel it should be good, just hoping for others opinions"
"Hey was just wondering if we don't have enough face masks supply, do you still recommend me and my friend going to Osaka and Tokyo in March? we are currently staying separately in Brisbane Australia and Singapore, and the face masks supply are very limited i.e. I myself can't even get one from the city... is there anywhere in Japan less crowded with people to travel to?"
"#89 still only about 20 confirmed cases in Japan among 125,000,000 population, so the odds are extremely in your favour. Read up the WHO precautions linked in these posts, keep updated on the latest information during and closer to departure and go for it. Japanese local virus spread is mostly under control and the flow of tourists from China is being restricted so hopefully much less spread. Less competition for hotels etc.Find masks in Japan as backup and practice hygiene."
"FYI,I called the Japanese tourism hotline (050-3816-2787). I asked will I be quarantined if I or someone on my flight is sick (ie fever, cough etc). The rep said unless the person is from Wuhan, there's no quarantine protocol."
Good to know. Hopefully the people coming to Japan in 4 or 5 months will rest easy now. For the moment.
"#90 thanks mate, really appreciate you clarifying the situation for me! got some hk friends telling me they cannot buy face masks themselves too in Japan... hopefully the supply will go back up soon.happy holidays!Edited: 12:03 am, February 04, 2020 "
"There are face masks sold (in some stores, the supply is totally out), they sell only one piece (containing three or so masks) per person per one occasion so that people won't be too greedy (there have been people, including tourists, who have been buying masks explosively). There has been a sudden surge of demand and people started stocking masks out of panic. I imagine that manufacturers will be increasing their production but you can't really tell what will be the situation in several weeks' time.Edited: 1:09 am, February 04, 2020 "
"<<91 of 94 ·FYI,I called the Japanese tourism hotline (050-3816-2787). I asked will I be quarantined if I or someone on my flight is sick (ie fever, cough etc). The rep said unless the person is from Wuhan, there's no quarantine protocol.>>This is good to know, thank you. The air flow on long haul flights always gives me short term stuffiness which could be perceived as cold symptoms... I wonder if a mask on the flight would reduce this anyway by being less drying"
#95 I too get those symptoms on long flights however I find saline nasal spray works very well. I spray it 30mins before boarding and as needed once on board (maybe every four to five hours). It keeps the nasal passage hydrated and clear which can help with that ‘stuffy’ feeling. Any plain nasal spray works well. Drinking herbal tea helps too.
"We’ve booked our flights and hotels too and we’re not to sure if we will cancel our trip in April. The hotels are refundable but the flights are only partly refundable, is it okay to visit in the 3rd week of April?"
#97 are you asking for permission to come in April or are you asking people if they know if the corona virus will be gone by then? No one on here can say with certainty what it will be like in April. Airlines usually waive their restrictions when something like this happens or after a natural disaster. Did you not book with a reputable airline? I can’t imagine a major airline not giving refunds if the epidemic changes to a pandemic.

"#99, you jinxed it. Now up to 23. Still not that bad all considered"
"I'm a healthcare professional.As of today. there is ZERO reason to worry about contracting the coronavirus while in Japan. Statistically, there is ZERO reason to worry about it. 23 cases in one of the most populous countries in the world puts you at close to ZERO risk.That being said...the scary thing about the coronavirus is the risk that it will spread fast. And, so far, it has not.Facemasks: don't bother. Most do nothing. You need to wear it all the time. You need to change it frequently during the day. And, again, you are most likely NOT in contact with someone with the virus. If you want to waste your money and resources and buy masks, sure. But at least read up on proper mask fitting and their efficacy once on before you buy 7 masks for your weeklong trip to Japan. If you're going to be paranoid, do it properly."
"Cruise ship in Japan had coronavirus passenger:https:/…index.htmlEdited: 11:48 am, February 04, 2020 "
"We are due to travel in two weeks to attend a big conference.I had bronchitis early January and am just getting over it, with a lingering cough. I’m aware during a conference there will be a big gathering of people.Are there any sites which post updates please? Am starting to worry a little about this work trip"
"I’m heading to Japan on the 15th. I’ve been thinking that since Chinese are a big part of the tourist numbers and since they can’t leave China that tourism and thus the amount of germs will be down and navigation will maybe be easier. As someone else said, there are other diseases and we have to take measures to build our immunity for them anyway."
"Anyone can comment on the public reaction and concerns in Tokyo? Are most of the public wearing masks in the subway and on the street? My family including a 9month old and a 3yr old is still undecided about our trip end of Feb. Our itinerary includes popular tourist sites such as shinjuku, ikebukuro, maybe even Disneyland. The recent news is the cruise is docked at Yokohama and everyone on board is quarantined. Is that escalating the concern in Tokyo since it's so close?"
https://www.japantimes.co.jp/
"Diamond Princess hasn't docked. It's been staying off shore. She will dock at Daikoku Wharf in Yokohama only for food and other material supply. Since 10 positives are found and hospitalized today, other passengers (about 2,600) and crews (about 1,300) will remain on board for 14 days from today on. Passengers are requested to stay in their room.People wear face mask regardless of coronavirus. This is the season of epidemic flu and soon will be hay fever. Shops have nearly no stock of masks, at least, in large cities. Manufactures increase production but the recovery is unknown. About 50 % of mask is imported from China, in the first place."
"Jakuki, I have friends living in Tokyo and many people are wearing masks and it’s more than usual but they don’t think it’s changing anything beyond more people are wearing masks. Everyone is still commuting to work and school so it’s business as usual here. Influenza is spreading at the moment."
People may be interested to know that my travel insurer told me today that they don't view transiting in PVG as entering China contrary to UK FCO recommendations so I can continue to plan. They also stated that they will cover rerouting should my flight eventually be cancelled. Very good cover!
"I have a trip to Japan in early April. Sucks that this virus is going around now, if I cancel I would lose my flight cost as well as hotel cost (booked non-refundable hotel for a part of my trip, really regretting this, should have spent extra $200 for refundable option). The cases in Japan now is 45, highest out of all countries outside of China. To be fair 20 cases are from the cruise, but with the way the Japanese government still letting Chinese tourists in, as well as being quite relax about this with the quarantine initially, then I'm afraid it can only go up. With the Olympics coming up, I thought they would should be more cautious about this virus spreading. I don't want to cancel so will keep watching. But if the cases go up to around 100 then I will have to bear the cost and cancel.Edited: 12:26 am, February 06, 2020 "
#112 glad to hear it! When do you fly?
"like what tonytt7 mentioned, it’s true.. I think we should get on with our everyday lives. Whatever happen has already been written no matter what religion we believe.. hugs everyone traveling soon. May God protect us all. Stay safe."
"More than ever, is it important to book your hotels and flights on a flexible ticket - read the fine print, make sure it really is flexi, no cancellation fees. I know I’ve said it before but it gives you so much peace of mind!I hope you all have safe travels."
"Hello,I am in the same situation like everyone on this thread. My friend and I bought tickets for end of March - beginning of April for Japan. We are not that scared that we will catch the virus in Japan, but our main concern are the stopovers. One will be in Shangai and the other one in SichuanWe will fly with Air China. Do you guys know anything if they cancelled flights already to China or will in the future? Should we cancel our flight? Is Shangai and Sichuan risky if we spend only 4-5 h in the airport? Many thanks"
Japan Airlines will cancel flights of Narita - Beijing/Shanghai and Nagoya -Shanghai from Feb 17 to Mar 28. It will also reduce the flight frequency of Haneda - Beijing.ANA will cancel flights of Narita - Beijing and reduce to fly 7 weekly flight for Haneda - Beijing from 14 weekly.No one can be certain of what the situation will be like in March and April.
# 118The best way is to check the homepage of AirChina often. Best wishes!!
"114 - Mid March. I suspect my airline (China Eastern) may well end up pulling my flights, in which case I plan to reroute via Hong Kong or Seoul."
"I just came back from a skiing trip in Japan last Saturday. Masks and dry hand santinizers sold out in many stores but other than that things seem normal. Japanese people wear masks often, I didn't see them more than usual and everyone seems much more relaxed than the people of my own country. I think Japanese are trained well in disaster prevention and hygiene. I am currently planning another trip in April with my friends and unless the Japanese government closes its border, I don't see why you shouldn't be going."
"Decided to cancel the trip end of feb. Figured it's too risky going with my 3 yr old and 8months old.For those who are still going, all the best, stay safe and enjoy! Hopefully I can go again soon. I bought 4 Ghibli museum tickets for Feb 24, anyone know if it can be transferred to others?"
"Best to reroute through Seoul. While HK hasn't seen an explosion of cases, nevertheless, ANA and HK Express canceled all Hong Kong <> Osaka flights for the next few weeks. There is no telling whether the cancellations will be expanded to include other airlines or airports.>>>114 - Mid March.

It is happening in the U.S now for certain people so it can happen anywhere in the world.
I live in Nagano prefecture and I feel like people has stopped caring already. Everyone was wearing masks and was talking about corona like a week ago but not anymore...people move on fast hah.
"#125 thanks for sharing that link, very useful reading. Fatalities affecting mainly older people is not surprising, as it does with regular flu. I also imagine that the mortality rate for younger people would be ordinarily be lower if the medical system in Wuhan wasn’t so severely overloaded right now."
"Re #118 -- countries and businesses that are banning people who have visited China are also banning people who havE TRANSITED China and doesn't matter if is two hours or 20 hours.Don't know where you are flying from but Air China is making big changes in its US schedule starting next week -- eliminating some flights, combining others and totally dropping service to some US cities."
"If the infected aged death rate information in this is correct https:/…With China average percentage of people over 60 years being about 12%31500 cases globally, 99% in China638 deaths, only 2 outside China, 500 over age 60 years (80%), 138 under 60 years age (20%)14% death rate among those over 60 years age, much more significant than 2% rate generally quoted for all ages. 0.5% death rate among those below 60 years age, significantly different at 4 times less than previously thought compared to 2% rate generally quoted for all ages. If correct this provides some greater risk assurance for this age group, about 1 in 200 potential death rate compared to 1 in 50 death rate.Edited: 6:23 am, February 07, 2020 "
I wouldn’t cancel. The chance of getting a virus is so small. Wear a mask if it makes you feel better but don’t cancel. Even when someone contracts the virus the chance of dying from it is 2%. Enjoy Japan! Here is my detailed 12 day itinerary in case you need ideas on what to do and what to see while in Japan:https:/…travel-planning
"Only fools misled by the media are in panic. Do a little research. A lot of people in Tokyo wear masks everyday. Do you know that it's considered rude to blow your nose in public in Japan?The coronavirus is no more dangerous to a healthy adult than a common cold. And, if you're not a healthy adult, you might want to postpone any travel.https://www.webmd.com/lung/coronavirus Common Symptoms of CoronavirusThe symptoms of most coronaviruses are similar to any other upper respiratory infection, including runny nose, coughing, sore throat, and sometimes a fever. In most cases, you won't know whether you have a coronavirus or a different cold-causing virus, such as rhinovirus.You could get lab tests, including nose and throat cultures and blood work, to find out whether your cold was caused by a coronavirus, but there's no reason to. The test results wouldn't change how you treat your symptoms, which typically go away in a few days.But if a coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract (your windpipe and your lungs), it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease, or people with weakened immune systems."
"Like viral infections I suppose the most common treatment is symptomatic relief treatment right?I notice people even in such a small town where I live, hearing people coming from East Asia immetiately brings people to high alert for some reason. I don't remember if it is was the same when the SARS was active. Could have been a difference in travel back then of course.Some people think this is just a hoax by the media to make people travel less. Of course this has bought other problems including rasism against Chinese people, created by fear and most likely created by media....But like any other viral infection, suppressed immune system, old or very young age, you should avoid the risk of travel."
"#132 all true except that based on figures nCoronavirus is reported to have a 2.2% death rate across all ages compared to flu of around 0.05% so about 44 times more likely to die (1 in 50 persons). The risk increases about 6 times for those above 60 years old and with underlying health issues compared to those below that age.In summary it has a much higher fatality rate than normal flu, which is what has the authorities across the world worried resulting in the drastic actions to manage it. If it spreads like the H1N1 flu did in 2009 to 10-20% (1.3 billion people) of the worlds population or even just in China there could be 30 million deaths world wide.Edited: 1:13 pm, February 08, 2020 "
Is the cruise ship off of Yokohama still quarantined?
"Yes, last I heard they are quarantined until feb 19 ( also read, not sure if it's true, if someone is found infected it will restart the quarantine period). Isn't that terrible... be in the wrong place at the wrong time and your stuck for two weeks or more."
"The Japanese government should quarantine all 3700 passengers instead of the select passengers with body temperatures above 37.5C. It might sound a conspiracy theory but I think the J gov. wants to keep the coronavirus tally low by not quarantining all passengers. All they care about is the ""image"" of the country for the upcoming Olympics. They can't let travel restrictions impacting the Olympics. To me they really don't care about well being of the passengers on board. It is really heartbreaking and sickening."
"Fzs, do you know how time-consuming and human power is necessary to check all the passengers? That is why they were reluctant to check all but after 70 positive carriers they are discussing checking how they can check all.It would be easier if US and other countries take their citizens by their ship etc.Are the Japanese responsible for paying taxes for the care of all the international passengers?"
The cost of taking care of the passengers is a drop in the bucket for the world 3rd largest economy. I would be very concerned if the earthquake and Tyhoon prone country like Japan cannot properly handle the situation like this. A lack of isolation facilities may be an issue but I don't think locking up passengers in solitary confinement for a prolong amount of time is a good idea for physical and mental health.
"Out of curiousity, is anyone here travelling to Japan later, May/June/July? What are your thoughts right now- wait and see, or do you plan on cancelling? I was hopeful this would under control in a few months but it certainly has accelerated!"
"Except the cruise ship and the people who returned from Wuhan, the four cases of people who got infectious in Nara, Osaka and Kyoto already cured and left hospitals.No new cases of people who stayed in Japan have been reported positive for a week or so. The cruise ship is in a complete different situation.Edited: 6:56 am, February 10, 2020 "
"Lisa, there are many of us who LIVE in Japan. NO ONE has died from the virus. (Fingers crossed.) Those who have caught the virus, whether from the cruise ship, the planes that brought back Japanese citizens and foreign residents who lived/were traveling in Wuhan, or the very FEW that contracted the virus who spent days with tourists from Wuhan, China, or from those who came in contact with those people, are on the mend, have been cured or have been released. No one knows what will happen in May/June/July and beyond. We don't even know what will happen in the rest of February/March/April! Be we do know that life will go on. I haven't heard of any ""averagel folk"" contracting the virus. The rule of thumb has been engrained into our lifestyle -- wash your hands and gargle when you go ""home."" ""Home""can be at work, or any other place. Don't touch your face if you haven't washed your hands. The Japanese tradition of Bowing is PERFECT for this season! No hugs, kisses or shaking hands! :-)"
"Lisa, we are scheduled for a week in Kyoto and then a cruise out of Yokohama in mid-May. We are also elderly, in our mid and late seventies and not in the best of health. Up until the cruise ship incident we were leaning towards still going. Now we have to consider the huge number of passengers from an infected ship that will be disembarking in Yokohama. How much longer can they quarantine those people? How much is known about the virus and the true incubation period? There is no way to test them all and they want off the ship to go home! I can see passengers not being forthcoming even if they have symptoms and just wanting to go to their own hospitals in their own country. It can’t possibly be more than an honor system and who would voluntarily go to a hospital in Japan not knowing the language, not confident in the care or maybe concerns over the cost? Then my mind goes to all those same passengers going to the airports. It is impossible to disinfect those! So sadly, Lisa, to answer your question my husband and I will be canceling our plans.Edited: 7:33 am, February 10, 2020 "
"We won't beg anybody to come. Nobody can say if it's safe or not, especially for the seniors.The cruise ship has a lot of elderly people who has diabetes, high blood pressure and other diseases. An American passenger talked on TV that after he disembarks, he would like to stay at a hotel and do some sightseeing in Tokyo as he originally planned.The minister of Healthcare of Japan announced that they started discussion of conducting PCR tests before they land on February 19. We have to watch the news update.　The flu in the States seems to be powerful, so please take care.Edited: 7:41 am, February 10, 2020 "
"There is no overtourism anymore here in Kyoto.If you are a contrarian, this could be the best time (ever) to visit Japan. I thought so too and went to Fushimi Inari Shrine few days ago.At least for now, I think it is not necessary to give up a trip to Japan.Of course I don't know what's gonna happen next. The situation could deteriorate dramatically. Nobody can rule out the possibility that the United States government implements a travel restriction to Japan (14 days restriction, suspend all flights to Japan or something like that).And I will NEVER board a cruise ship until the disease is gone. It's not only about a concern for infection, but it's also about an itinerary thing. Under this special circumstance, everything could be a mess very easily (Oh, poor passengers of Westerdam...).One more thing. Please note that it is very common to put a face mask on the street in Japan. Nobody considers a person wearing a mask as an weirdo or a sick person.*The following websites are written in Japanese.https:/…https:/…GE00031499.shtml"
I'm not worried about the virus as such. Take precautions. Masks. Hand sanitizer. I'm more concerned about getting caught up because I'm prone to bronchitis which I have at the moment. Spoke to doctor about it today. He said it could get me quarantined because of the higher than normal temp and barking cough. We go in 3 weeks and it will be gone by then but worried about coping it again because of the cold.
I heard an infectious disease specialist on National Public Radio who said that masks are only useful for those with the disease to prevent its spread. He said there is no reason for healthy people to wear masks as they are unlikely to prevent infection. There is a worldwide shortage of masks and our first responders and hospital staff need them. You can listen for yourselves here: https://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/2020/…
I’m going in May/June. My thinking is that the vadt majority of infected in Japan is on the ship or was infected in Wuhan and then evacuated to Japan. I’m not super scared and I’m 75% sure of going. The medicsl community and scientists will have found out so much more by then too.
"The coronavirus will disappear when it gets hot in June, just like SARS did. But, I hope it disappear earlier in April. I also hope that effective medication is established soon, as it was reported that anti-flu drug oseltamivir conbined with anti-HIV drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir, was effective against this coronavirus in Thailand, as follows.https:/…73879572.cms"
"Infections jumped from 26->161 in Japan overnight. Wonder where that will lead. Really, it's probably nothing but if you can afford not to go and reschedule to some time later/money is not an issue, why not?"
"You can find a person that says they are good, then another that says they are not, they don't even know definitively how the thing is spread, I will wear the mask. Funny how the articles start flying around that masks are no good once there is a shortage. I've a few articles on this, one saying both surgical and N95 were no good but then concluded that if you have no mask to use a scarf?!? Before all the shortages on masks they were saying N95 was the way to go."
"N95 doesn't offer more protection if not worn properly. It's also a lot stuffier. Per the medical advice I see, normal surgical masks are good. In fact, how you use any mask determines whether it acts as an effective barrier or a further vehicle for transmission. If you keep fiddling with your mask or put it on your chin when you take a drink, you contaminate the mask."
My Hokkaido trip is from 22 Feb to 1 Mar. Concern now is whether my family (Malaysian) will be mistaken as Chinese from mainland China and not welcome to some eateries in Sapporo..... hesitating if we should proceed with our trip
Here is the official WHO advice on using masks https:/…when-and-how-to-use-masks
"#159In major tourist area, local people are aware that there're none or very few people coming from mainland China at the moment. Tourists from China are mainly either in group tour or packaged travel, both of which have been prohibited in China so far. As I see in Kyushu, Okinawa, and Chugoku since CNY, tourists who speak Chinese are mainly Taiwanese, sometimes Singaporeans or Malaysians. I noticed 2 young ladies who speak Chinese with northern accent, but I can't tell whether they are tourists from China or living in somewhere in Japan."

"Dear ETflyerI'm sorry but what you are saying is quite doubtful.First, most local people know that the Chinese tourists who belong to a group tour are now minority (30-40% or something like that). Numbers of Chinese tourists declined dramatically recently, but Chinese mainland tourists are still visiting Japan.And most importantly, most Japanese people (98-99%+) can't figure out where Chinese speaking people come from. Mainlanders, Taiwanese, Hong Kongers, Singaporeans, Malaysians... they are all the same for Japanese people. I mean Japanese people usually don't know who they are and where they are from. Of course, most workers in the tourism sector can recognize them very easily."
"Dear Alexnmy,Personally, I don't care at all as far as you don't cough or sneeze. Recently, Japanese people hesitate to cough in public and try to hold it back desperately. So do I. It's absolutely painful!!Please read my previous post, too. That might be a bad news for you unfortunately."
"To OutofTheSky (#165): How do you stop yourself from sneezing??!So family and I going next month. We are of Chinese descent, but live in US and never even been to mainland China. I'm used to the discrimination here, but don't want family exposed to this sort of thing. Shall we just announce we are Americans from the US when we step into some small restaurant or store?! Thoughts?"
"Just a point on masks and effectiveness:People in japan have been wearing them for years, and many of them incorrectly. I get a lot of guests that work in the medical profession and it drives them bonkers seeing masks covering the mouth, but not the nose. There is an up-tick in correct use/coverage (mouth and nose), which is a positive thing."
"Thanks for the tip, JapanCustomTours.Will be bringing many masks, but I'm wondering if I will be able to buy hand sanitizer in Tokyo so that I don't have to bring a giant bottle of it from here."
"Those poor people on the Cruise Ship. 175 now. How is a 2 week quarantine going to help when more and more people seem to becoming infected, even a quarantine officer now. They have already been quarantined over a week. Are the Japanese officials going to have to keep resetting the timer to 1 day? I cannot believe Japan cannot do better by them, take them to a military base, and separate them so they do not continue to contract the virus. There are too many uknown variables with the virus. I am just really shaking my head at the way Japan is treating this. They either don't want, to or cannot test every single passenger. I have read that guests that were being taking to the hospital have it so bad they wished they were back on the ship. There is a TV in their room, but they have to pay for it if they want to watch it. A lady wanted to take a bath and was not given a towel but told that she could buy one. She wanted food other then Japanese and was sold a sandwich. Back on the ship though they weren't getting fed often enough or given any care packages all week. They were being treated little better then prisoners. What the heck happened to the Japanese Omotenashi they are famous for? Their bungling of this crisis is shaming Japan in front of the entire world."
"I believe Japan is doing good, where do you want them to put 3700 people and how do you want them to be transported so they don't infect others? It's a shame there is not a 5000 room Ritz Carlton next door. Keep in mind this virus has a very long incubation period, up to 2 weeks, many of those people were probably already infected. As far as the hospitals go, maybe the hospital does not supply towels, why would you expect them to treat foreigners any differently? When it comes to hospital food, you get what you get and that is about it, no hospital I've ever encountered caters to you. One should remember when you visit another country, the things you are used to, may not be the norm there. If I was on that ship, I'd be grateful to be in Japan, it could have been worse."
"We too have made the decision to continue with our trip next month. We have chosen to avoid Yokohama (usually stay there a few days) and instead head for Nagano (never been there ) than continue with our previous plans including Hiroshima and Fuji Five Lakes. Life itself is a risk and we will take recommended precautions , washing hands often, wearing mask while in crowd etc. We have also decided to use more taxis and avoid overcrowded subways.I think everyone has to make their own decision and do what is best for themselves. I am not a medical ,professional but I do have serious concerns about how Japan is handling the quarantine of the Diamond Princess. Not sure why they didn’t arrange to remove them and quarantine on land. Surely ,there are some facilities on various military bases that could manage this."
"We have an upcoming trip as well on the 29th to Osaka only. How’s the situation in osaka with regards to coronavirus? I saw some news where someone from the Japanese evacuees who came from Wuhan is now tested positive after 12 days, and that same person was tested negative before."
"We are currently scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on 11 March for 9 days and have been (like everyone else) following the situation as closely as we can. Unfortunately for us if we cancel or decide not to go we are out our entire flight/hotel package unless the Canadian government makes Japan as a recommended no go country due to the coronavirus. So far our government has only put in place a voluntary quarantine for those arriving from even the epicenter. Our citizens who were flown out are in a mandatory 14 day quareteen but not the flight crew who flew them out (crazy ). Also our Prime Minister has gone as far as to state that any person who even expresses a concern about getting sick from the virus is racist against the Chinese people. (in fact it is only people of all countries who have been in the epicenter or in contact with those who have within 14 days that are at risk of either being sick or being a carrier. Nationality has zero to do with the risk, geographic area of visiting has 100% to do with the risk).When we couple that with all the misinformation flowing around the internet from major news outlets, online trolls and the Chinese government and even the WHO, it makes it very difficult to get accurate information or to even have a civilized discussion about the potential risks. We are currently sitting on the fence as to making a decision and waiting until about a week prior to see if the situation has changed any. People can claim great or no risk , yet the bottom line is the individual and the comfort level one has with your own perceived risk. Our trip like most other travelers trips is not cheap so it is a major financial loss if we do not go but not the end of the world. I cannot imagine the strain , personally, mentally and financially the people living in the quarantine areas in China must be feeling. As of today I believe that the risk is really low for us visiting tokyo but we still wait and worry until departure day arrives and either we get on the flight to Tokyo or we stay home. A clear head , proper hygiene (same as during the current flu season in North America) and accurate information will help make sure that each of us tourists stays healthy and can make the appropriate choice for us whether or not to travel. Not being there currently , and lacking reliable information I will refrain from making judgement as to the way things are being done."
"Check the news like the Japan Times or Japan News.Except thw contanimated cruise ship and the people who returned from Wuhan,4 cases of secondary and thirdry infections have been reporrted in January and they cute d .and left the hospitals We haven't heard of those after China banned group tours abroad."
"Anthony, if you're not going to get your money back anyway, why don't you wait until March 10? Anything can happen between now and then. Meanwhile, life in Tokyo is no different than it was a month ago. There are a LOT less tourists, though, so it's a great time to go visit touristy places. Of course, that's not good for those who are in tourism. Shops, restaurants, bus companies, hotels are all feeling the crunch. Here are some Japanese news sites. https://japantoday.comhttps://www.japantimes.co.jphttp://www.asahi.com/ajw/?iref=comtop_usnavihttps://mainichi.jp/english/"
"I have booked 1 night in Yokohama, if I go through with my trip to Japan in April, should I cancel that 1 night hotel in Yokohama and book somewhere else in Tokyo? I think the cruise people should all be gone by then, but it's abit worrying staying there knowing there were nearly 200 people infected with covid-19.Edited: 10:20 pm, February 12, 2020 "
"Yokohama is a huge area and they are quarantined on the cruise ship. I don't find any reason so far to cancel your hotel in Yokohama unless you are for harmful rumors.Well, some cruise people will stay in hotels in Tokyo after they disembark, so I hope they will carry out PCR tests of all the members before they land.Edited: 10:26 pm, February 12, 2020 "
"That's my concern as well, I hope they test everyone before letting them off the cruise. I won't cancel yet, but will look for other hotel just in case if my family members feel they prefer to stay away from Yokohama.Edited: 11:15 pm, February 12, 2020 "

"Has anybody actually been out there or know anybody out there ? I'm a social butterfly and really enjoy the nightlife out there , meant to be going in a month and concerned that people are not going out of a night time . Anybody any feedback ? . Thanks"
"I have my trip scheduled to Japan for 9 days starting April 15th. But now i am a little worried. but to see at the bright side, Japan is a good country which means they take good measures to contain the spread at least to give assurance to the Olympics visitors. also, the ship right now is on the water and no one is on the land yet. so, we cannot say anything until they decide on what to be done with the ship after the quarantine period is over. seems like the new cases on the land seemed to be none in the recent days. apart from all this, i believe there are a lot of Japanese citizens living and breathing just like the tourists. so looking at the numbers it looks quite safe for me. Also, it is still 2 months away and i believe many other countries would have contained the spread to the great extent."
""" I'm a social butterfly and really enjoy the nightlife out there , meant to be going in a month and concerned that people are not going out of a night time "" going out where? In places like tokyo? Other than it being winter I don't imagine its much different than usual. If the number of infections start to skyrocket I'm sure nightlife will disappear but Japan doesn't have a huge number of cases once you subtract the cruise ship and they are implementing travel bans from the provinces most impacted in China."
"""Also, it is still 2 months away and i believe many other countries would have contained the spread to the great extent."" two months is a long time. Who knows how this will play out. So far the spread is limited but that could change very rapidly if infected people get in and aren't flagged for quarantine.Edited: 1:48 am, February 13, 2020 "
Jason... some bars were really dead on Monday night here but some places were still a little busy. The bar area in Kyōto was quieter over the weekend but a little more active on Monday night. My friends in Tokyo are still going out drinking and they said Monday night this week was fun.
"mamajelli , yes we will ultimately make the decision the night before. Thank-you for the links to local news it is much appreciated. I had also thought that things might be less busy and make it easier to visit some of the prime tourist sites. I am slowly becoming more comfortable with the situation and the actual risks versus the media frenzy.. If the situation in Japan does not change I cannot foresee any reason not to visit. I am quite excited about visiting Tokyo for the first time and would not want to miss out due to mass hysteria."
"There is a lot of over-speculation in the last two pages with very little logic being applied leading to self confusion for several posters.The numbers still are very much in favour of near zero chance of infection for a tourist visiting Japan. Current virus cases in Japan are only 26 on the mainland, the cruise ship cases are confined until it is controlled, 26 cases in 125,000,000 Japanese population is the logical answer, forget what else is happening elsewhere.Be aware of the WHO precautions in their website. Make some adjustments to how you travel in if needed in Japan such as spend less time in the big cities. You can still enjoy it.If your logic can not overcome your fear then cancel your trip for peace of mind for that is what is most important to you regardless of the truth or false."
Checking the news is the most important thing. A taxi driver in Tokyo and a surgeon in Wakayama were reported positive tonight.
"I'm watching this closely and will decide at the end of March if we're going through with the trip. It's not looking good for Japan with the new cases reported just now from Kyodo news.Tokyo taxi driver and doctor from Wakayama confirmed and first death which is a new case and not related to the cruise. RIP for the woman, she tested positive after she passed away and never been to Wuhan or abroad.https://twitter.com/kyodo_english"
The tv news said that the old lady who died of Coronavirus is the mother-in-law of the taxi driver.
"Now 29 Japan mainland cases in 125,000,000 population still the odds are extremely safe.If there is major increase such as 100s and 1000s that will be time to reconsider.Be logical everyone but keep informed and updated.Edited: 9:24 am, February 13, 2020 "
What people had been so scared is now going on (Something similar to Singapore or maybe Hong Kong). The situation is changing really fast as I feared.Very sad...
"We managed to book some of the last available rooms for the Matsuri in Takayama for the 14-16th of April. I am really wondering about the wisdom of going to the festival but I guess it won't be different then touring Tokyo and getting on a Metro. I think we just all need to pray that the virus is contained in Japan over the course of the next few weeks/month and that there continues to be only isolated cases. However like on that cruise ship, it seems one person can start a chain reaction and infect hundreds. I do not want to cancel the trip, it is my first trip to Japan and a lifetime of wanting to go. If I cancel we lose the cost of the flights, and perhaps our one chance to see the Sakuras."
"No plans to cancel our trip (arriving 1st June), it’s our first ever trip to Japan, and we’ve been waiting for this for a very long time. Really hoping things are contained then, as I’m terrified that it’ll be cancelled or that we’ll have to go into mandatory quarantine!"
""" In as high a temp as you want covid-19 starts evaporating in, April is drawing near,"" This is not how it works. First off, we don't know if this will be seasonal or not. There is no way you can know this because none of the real experts know. They hope but there is not a history for this virus to base this on yet. Second, viruses like these do not evaporate in the heat. These types of viruses spread easier in the winter because people tend to be confined inside in clusters vs spread out while outside. Also, colder air is usually easier for viruses to spread via droplets because they float better on the cool dry air vs warm humid air the droplets sink faster and hence don't transmit as easily. A lot of experts are of the belief that this may be a seasonal thing and it will continue to spread around the world. The purposes of quarantines are not to completely stop the spread. The cat is out of the bag already and its around the world. The purpose of quarantines in a situation like this where you can't stop the spread is to slow it down as much as possible to allow the scientists enough time to develop viable treatment options and eventually vaccines in order to minimize the overall impact on the population."
"My husband, 11 year old daughter and I leave for Japan the last week of March. This will be our first time in Japan and we have no plans to cancel our trip! I work in public health in the US and have no concerns about travel to Japan at this time. We are paying close attention to credible information sources though...Edited: 9:47 pm, February 13, 2020 "
"Amy-We are in the same boat. My husband, 13-year-old and I are supposed to leave March 18 (also Portland people). I am not quite as confident as you are. Still planning to go but hesitant as the situation seems somewhat volatile. I would love to ask you some questions based on your public health background. I tried to message you but said you were not accepting messages. If you are willing to have a conversation can you message me via Tripadvisor? Thank you so much."
"The New York Times website has posted several articles about the spread of the virus, what we can expect, and what's still uncertain. They update these articles every day or two."
I am still pondering actually on my flight from Feb 27-March 11 to Hokkaido. Is there any news from Hokkaido?
"""I am still pondering actually on my flight from Feb 27-March 11 to Hokkaido"" - Honestly I don't see much difference between Japan and Malaysia at this point. I probably would feel more comfortable in Japan and I am not sure there are even any reported cases in Hokkaido. A lot of the numbers in Japan have to do with the cruise ship."
Post#200: Av PDX - We have a Tokyo trip about the same date as yours March 18th from PDX. We are probably on the same flight.There will be 4 of us and we are still planning on going so far.
So far none from Hokkaido reported. One suspicious case is reported in Okinawa among shore excursion staff and the result will come in three hours.
GraceK we are actually flying from Seattle. My main concern is the latest infections don’t have an easily traceable source. Just waiting to see what unfolds.
Our tickets are on March 12th. Would be nice to have the updates from public health sources. Thank you!
"I am due visit Japan on 26 Feb for the Tokyo marathon and I think I'm 90% certain of cancelling the trip, not because I think I'll die from catching the virus, but because I don't fancy nor can I afford to quarantine myself for at least 2 weeks after returning to the UK from Japan. Any thought on the absolute requirement of quarantine after visiting Japan from Amy (199) or anyone else is much appreciated. Many thanks in advance."
Would they quarantine you in the UK even you don't have a fever?
"No, not when returning from Japan, but it would be self imposed quarantine to be fair on family and others."
"It still not that widely spread yet except Diamond Princess in Japan.But if you don't feel like enjoying it, it is really up to you to cancel it.Edited: 5:06 am, February 14, 2020 "
I have the same concerns as #214. I read on another threas on TA that Japan is planning to start quarantine measures for everyone on a flight if even one passanger has symptoms. That is not a situation I would want to put myself into. But I am not really sure if they are actually doing that for flights from North America.
"#216 I read the same thing, but it doesn’t seem to have been shared by any Western media. I wonder if it is more a case of updated legislation that means it is now legal for that to happen, rather than it necessarily being standard procedure."
"#217, yeah I am also surprised because it does not show up anywhere else (media or official travel advisory (in English)). I still have a few days before my flight. If I don't get clarification by then, I will call the airline and Japanese embassy.Very confusing situation!"
"#216, Please post if you find out about quarantining people on a flight when it's found someone has tested positive. I am to go to Japan in April and as many others have said, being quarantined is my #1 concern. Not only will it ruin the japan vacation but surely my next vacation as it'll eat up my vacation time :("
"#219, I certainly will share whatever I find out. I will also keep following this thread to see if anyone else has any information.I hear you. I get limited annual vacation time and I certainly don't wan to risk spending that being quarantined!"
"We are about to travel Japan at the middle of March for about a month.Currently, we aren't thinking about cancelling, as the percentage of the infected people are really small camparing to the population, about 0.002% are infected. which half of them came from China to Japan."
"So far from what I’ve checked on Japanese airlines:*(Restriction on Entry to JapanBy directives enforced by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan, entry to Japan will not be permitted for passengers below effective February 13 (Thursday), 2020 until further notice.Any non-Japanese passport holders visited Hubei Province or Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China in the past 14 days at the time of arrival in Japan.Passport holders issued by Hubei Province or Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China. For details please refer to the website of Immigration Services Agency of Japan.)So I guess now they’ve stop ppl from PRC to enter Japan I s’pose?"
Strange. There's nothing on the Immigration Services Agency site. http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/english/index.htmlI'm pretty sure they haven't stopped ALL people from China (PRC) from entering Japan. Just some provinces. Group tours to Japan have been cancelled by the Chinese government. Here's ANA's site. https:/…anchor003JALhttps:/…
"#221 the majority of the 29 cases, not including the cruise ship cases which are the majority if counted, are directly associated with travellers or Japanese people travelling from China, with less than about 10 or so from secondary infection transfer within Japan such as a taxi driver transporting tourists and his mother in law getting it from him and tour bus driver from Chinese passengers etc. @shot above has mentioned specific cases in their posts.There are broad numbers and statistics at this site with explanations https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Edited: 7:58 pm, February 14, 2020 "
"#216 can you tell us what thread that was on?Here I was worried that I might catch the virus in Japan, not at being responsible for bringing it there. If they start quarantining flights from North America and Europe they can kiss the Olympics goodbye. They probably will have to cancel it anyways.I didn't purchase my trip health insurance in time for my flight in late March. When all this started I wanted to wait and see what happened before spending the money because I was afraid that the epidemic would spread to Japan like it had in China within a few weeks. Since January 30th the Coronavirus is no longer covered by the Insurance. I have written World Nomads to clarify their policy since my understanding is that if I get sick the Insurance will no longer cover medical bills from a known epidemic. If insurance companies are no longer going to cover trips to Japan and this virus starts getting worse tourism is going to be done for the season if not longer.Edited: 8:39 pm, February 14, 2020 "
@225 this is the link re quarantine.https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g29… Where will they put all the travellers & how are they going to test each plane load arriving? The cruise ship saga hasn’t been resolved and now the government is creating another without thinking through the implications?I certainly don’t fancy spending 2 wks in quarantine based on this approach.
Hi Nestra. We go two weeks today. I'm getting people saying have you cancelled yet. I'm not worried either about getting sick. I'm worried about quarantined because of my bronchitis I have at moment. Same symptoms unfortunately.
"#227 if you are not fit to travel anywhere then perhaps cancel, especially given the current Corona situation.If you are coughing everywhere in public people around you are going to be constantly thinking if you might be affected by the virus and the risk is always there you may be asked to explain and targeted for quarantine.If you do go perhaps carry a doctors note or certificate explaining what your condition is when and where it was diagnosed."
"I agree with many of the posts below - I’m not too concerned with catching the virus in Japan (low infection numbers) I’m more concerned (very concerned, actually) with someone else on the plane being tested positive and then them quarantining everyone else on the plane. I do recall reading that passengers two rows in front or behind the infected passengers must be tested but it wasn’t an official source.The Japanese authorities MUST post a clear update on this and policies for compulsory quarantine - but given they’ve quarantined everyone on that cruise, I think we know what the position is.I have to say... I’m very tempted to cancel.Edited: 2:34 am, February 15, 2020 "
"@230, do speak with your insurance company. I spoke with mine on Friday & was told anything to do with Coronavirus is not covered irrespective of when it was purchased. Your insurance company may have different rules. None of the media (local Japanese & international) seemed to have picked up on this quarantine policy. Neither did JAL on the website. FYI article from Japantimeshttps:/….XkfDNS_ZWf0"
"I’m surprised the insurance issue isn’t being made more of globally.I’m in Australia and cannot get any insurance to cover anything to do with coronavirus for travel anywhere in the world. I’m travelling to the UK, France and Finland, not China. There’s a lot of talk about the economic loss due to Chinese tourism currently, but the next wave will probably be worse, as those like myself have to consider putting off travel, leaving a very big hole in tourism operators’ pockets over the next few months."
"#230 that’s similar to what I read and makes the most sense, practically. To quarantine a whole plane is excessive but a few rows would make sense.Of course, we have zero control of someone onboard being ill. But, to be reasonable, if you’re flying from, say, Australia or America etc. your chance of someone having coronavirus onboard isn’t terribly high. Fingers crossed for us all to have safe travels!!!"
"Got an unhelpful cut and paste response from the British embassy in japan when asking about the quarantine situation. can only interpret it as “we don’t really know but we urge you to cooperate if something does happen”“Public Health England have published advice to those travelling to China and neighbouring countries, and additional health screening measures may be in place, which we would urge you to comply with. You should maintain good hand, respiratory and personal hygiene and should avoid visiting animal and bird markets or people who are ill with respiratory symptoms. “"
"They keep giving the same ol’ default copy/paste advice: wash your hands? I mean come on, we all know soap exists. We don’t need a coronavirus to remind us.What we need from our governments is solid advice so we know whether to travel or not. If compulsory quarantine is in place if someone on my flight or in my hotel is sick, I want to know - coz I’ll be cancelling fo’ sure!"
"We're going to Japan from march 10th, we;ve planned this trip for a very long time and already spend tons of many on it.I do not see any reason at all to cancel it. 29 sick people is nothing, absolutely nothing. The whole situation has been winded up by media to such a degree it's ridiculous. Obviously the situation in China is worrying, and the borders with it should be closed until the situation is fixed, but people canceling their trips to other countries (Japan, Thailand, hell even Australia) i do not understand that. Getting hit by a car right beside your home is more probable then getting coronavirus there in this moment.The only worry we have is that someone will be sick on a plae (not a coronavirus) and the quarantine possibility. This scares me a lot, not the virus itself."
Why 29? Japan has 337 cases by now.
"Well, a Japanese couple living in Nagoya, which husband was coughing, could get back from Hawaii on Feb. 7 and hospitalized and confirmed yesterday and the wife was confirmed today.It is hard to detect the coronavirus.Edited: 7:20 am, February 15, 2020 "
"We were supposed to leave today to go to Tokyo but after monitoring the situation for the past week, we pulled the plug yesterday and canceled our trip. Up until 3 days ago I felt that things were largely contained to the original group of people who arrived from China (setting aside the cruise ship numbers). But the last two days have seen an uptick of Japanese to Japanese transmissions, and with taxi drivers passing it around from a boat party and now a businessman who went on a bullet train for a meeting even after feeling ill....I can’t trust that it is contained any longer. The logical part of me says the risk is still ridiculously low, and I have just as much risk picking it up here in the US but the last day in cases just somehow pushed it over my invisible line for comfort."
"My insurance company have reassured me that we are completely covered for any Coronavirus-associated cancellations or medial treatment. So, there's that.I think that unless the official UK travel advice turns to 'do not travel' over the next two weeks, we will take our chances. I've found it very easy to get caught up in the media hysteria, but I've been looking at Instagram stories from Narita airport etc. and my planned destinations and truly life seems as normal in Japan. Thousands arriving without quarentine issues every day. It definitely has helped me put the numbers in perspective!"
"#237 it’s 29 cases because the cruiseliner ship cases are not counted.To all others expecting an easy answer from governments, airlines, quarantine agencies, World Health Organisation etc as if it one can snap fingers to get an easy answer - it’s clearly not. The frustration of not knowing is very understandable.Even though I have been one of those people who have been trying to ease the panic with talk of low risk of infection posts, I can see it is impossible or impracticable to test plane loads of people, that embassies and health authorities can only give standard answers, to arrive at total bans on countries except China are difficult decisions. The worlds most qualified experts and agencies are working this out, there are huge global economic, stability and other issues if the panic button is pressed too early, it is still effectively less than one month since this has got attention so there is not enough time yet to handle something of this potential scale.Anyone with a panic mentality and looking for reasons with their public health, quarantine and science hats on knows there are a multitude of difficulties in this. Current offical information is that Corvid-19 behaves like a flu in the way it spreads highly contagious and potentially rampant in the right situation, that is by physical spread and air in close proximity to infected person. The human world has not experienced this since the last three virus epidemics in 1918 Spanish flu, 2003 SARS and 2009 H1N1 (we survived the last two very well and forgot about them). How do you test a plane load of people to conveniently tell who is infected and who is not within short transit times, where would they put all of these people in quarantine, there are not enough test facilities and so it can go on and on until one is a quivering jelly fish.To the average person the above issues are completely or mostly out of one’s control, the only logical options to consider are:1. Proceed on trip and manage and inform yourself as best as possible given the current very low risk, monitor situation until departure date. This is by far the current most logical position.2. Wait and see, delay until further researched and how the issue develops, assess need to travel perhaps go another time. Second logical decision.3. Cancel for various reasons including reason No. 4 below. Third logical decision.4. Let the panic and fear run rampant and unchecked, keep knocking on the wrong doors for answers. Not recommended.Edited: 11:53 am, February 15, 2020 "
"""#237 it’s 29 cases because the cruiseliner ship cases are not counted."" that seems like old numbers I'm seeing 53 or 49 if you don't count asymptomatic people."
Hi Ali. Good idea about getting a doctors letter. Hasn't thought of that. My Bronchitis is nearly gone so should be good to go in 2 weeks. Antibiotics. Corral and cough mixture. Not contagious to anyone just a pain for me.
"8 Cases in Tokyo today. For the first time I am getting seriously worried about our trip, at the end of the month. If we don't go it will probably be another year before we could go again. I did not purchase the insurance in time. I had no idea they would place a blanket ""No coverage for Coronavirus issues"". I thought it was just going to be no coverage for trips to China. Does anyone have experience purchasing Insurance at Narita? Perhaps a Japanese insurer would cover any sickness caused by the virus?"
"As an observation, there are other forums with threads on corona virus and people unnecessarily panicking.And there are still places in the world with much higher risk diseases (or other hazards) than this latest one."
"First of all, the disease's treatment is free of charge in Japan (just like the UK's NHS, South Korea and Vietnam). You don't need to worry that you won't be able to receive a proper treatment because of money shortage.Having said that, you should join a good travel insurance anyway. Because something bad other than coronavirus could happen to you."

Maybe for japanese citizens, but surely not for international tourists."
"#246, I researched what medical was covered when I visited Scotland last year with a friend who thought medical care there was free. What I found was while they will treat you, whether you get a bill or not depends on how much treatment and services is needed.I also remember it depended where you were from, all I knew was coming from the US, I needed insurance.Edited: 5:22 pm, February 15, 2020 "

Also, no charge can apply to any treatment provided up to the point that it is negatively diagnosed.Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an exemption because the virus is too serious.

"OutofTheSky, could you please post a link confirming this to be true in Japan?? It would be a huge relief to many of us contemplating travel to Japan in the very near future.Thank you"
"Of course, in Japan, everybody has to pay for a treatment of any disease or injury except for novel coronavirus (flu, broken bones etc). And it could be a huge cost to a foreign tourist. That's why you'll need a travel insurance anyway.I'm sorry for making you misunderstand."

"https:/…Q3> An examination is performed when the prefecture determines that it is necessary based on the history of travel and the history of contact with patients. In such cases, the cost of the inspection itself is unnecessary."
"Thank you OutofTheSky! It is comforting to know that we wouldn't have to pay out of the pocket for medical treatment of any sickness resulting from the virus. There are no cases in Mexico where we live. Going to Japan would be putting ourselves at, risk and then not having it as an uninsurable known epidemic would make it a very tough decision to make."
"I contracted cholera in Chiapas in 1993. I was treated (rehydrated intravenously) in a small clinic in San Cristobol de las Casas, Mx. Despite having bought insurance, there was no charge. Cholera was considered a public health emergency and all treatment was accordingly free. I assume there is a similar policy at play in Japan. Either way, my family has insurance. We’re travelling in Japan for two weeks in early March."
"Looking at how the US and Hong Kong governments will deal with the passengers of Diamond Princess, maybe they will change their policies with people travelling to Japan."
"Any words of wisdom please? I’m due to fly to Tokyo on Tuesday but have just picked up a very badly timed head cold/sinus congestion.Usually I would most likely battle on, despite the possible air pressure issues but in the current situation I am seriously considering pulling the plug on trip. I have until tonight to decide before I lose free cancellation at 1st hotel. Not sure I’ll get flight costs back. I’m conscious my cold with both alert others around me and upon entry would I be looked at as suspicious? I presume with no fever I’d be ok but is it worth the stress?!"
"If your temperature goes up, that means stay home I guess."
"#257 sorry to hear that! I would think with a normal temperature you’ll be fine, but if you decide to go then stocking up on some meds that relieve the symptoms wouldn’t hurt for the plane ride itself. Perhaps a mask to reassure jittery passengers. Note that some over the counter decongestants from the UK are prohibited in Japan (I believe anything with pseudoephedrine in is). You could contact your GP for peace of mind and ask for a letter that explains that it’s a simple head cold. Or if you are preferring to not risk it, perhaps a letter from your GP recommending against travel due to your illness & current Covid outbreak may suffice for a full refund from your insurance company"

What fun would that be?It is probably better to defer the trip until a better time. Are you sure you cannot recover the flight costs? Many airlines are providing accommodations for changes and refunds to travelers affected."
"If you think you still can enjoy your trip even you have a cold, take medicine and go for it.Everything might look dull and just wishing to relax when you have a cold."
Holland America just cancelled our Feb 29th cruise on the Westerdam that was supposed to sail Yokohama to Yokohama. We are still thinking of coming to do a land based trip. Spend a few days in Yokohama before and after flying down to Okinawa for 7 or 8 days.What do you think? I've watched a few YouTube videos of Japanese locals and they don't seem to be too worried. Just wear a mask and wash your hands a lot.Would appreciate your thoughts if you're a local in Japan (Tokyo/Yokohama and Okinawa).
"Check the Japn Times or Japan News.More and more cases are reported every day so it's a bit horrifying even Tokyo is a city of 13 million, so finding some might not be a big deal yet.About Okinawa, just one case."
"Why Yokohama? Tokyo is just a short train trip away. If you aren't bound to a cruise, spend your time at Tokyo instead.>>>Spend a few days in Yokohama before and after flying down to Okinawa for 7 or 8 days."
#264Create a new thread and you'll get more responses. I don't think Okinawa is a good destination in early March. Tokyo and Kansai will be better for a first timer with 7-8 days.
My trip to Hokkaido (22 to 1 March) is approaching soon but the corona virus outbreak there is getting worried too....... Pretty confused now if I should proceed with the trip or to cancel it. Concern is mostly to the announcement on 13 Feb whereby all passengers will be disallowed entry if any suspect case on the same plane. This will not only ruin our travelling plan but also very worry if quarantine act will happen too. Really need some insight advice here.
It looks like there is now discussion of canceling the Tokyo marathon on March 1. …blogspot.com/2020/02/tokyo-marathon-looking…
"@268. Same as here. We are supposed to fly this Friday to Tokyo, for 10 days. But since the number of infected people in Japan is rising we are not sure anymore. We won't get any refund back from our flight and our hotel. We are afraid we might need to be in quarantine when getting back home. Or someone on our flight has the virus. I can;t get any information about people coming back from Japan trip."
"Re my post #257 - although my head cold is somewhat clearing up I still have some sinus issues and so I am probably going to cancel trip. As said, I would normally fly but it just isn’t worth the hassle in current situation sadly - plus its flu season in Japan so a risk of picking something else up!Hopefully rebooking around November time and all this will be history!"
A nurse has contracted the virus now... https:/…
We will be there with 6 friends from Singapore. Looking forward to it.

"My family is meant to travel between Feb 29 and March 13, dividing our time between Kyoto and Tokyo and travelling by bullet train. We had intended to simply go ahead with our travel plans unless Canada issues a travel advisory/and or Air Canada cancels our flights, but I am beginning to doubt the wisdom of this plan. It is easy to envision a scenario where Air Canada suspends flights to and from Japan when we are already in the country. I am also concerned that trains or metros could be suspended, and tourist sites closed in order to minimize crowds. I note that the Ghibli Museum, while still open, has started offering refunds on tickets.My spouse is a doctor who works in a busy ER, and I am also concerned about him spreading the disease to vulnerable patients should he contract the disease and return to work while he is asymptomatic. We will wait until the last minute to decide, because it will be much easier to obtain refunds if there is an advisory. But I suspect we will not be going on this trip."
The risk of heading to Japan is certainly increasing.I have plans from last year to travel late March for 2 weeks and it is now looking like we will not be going.I will also wait until the last minute to decide but travel bans/suspensions can be announced anytime and what could be worse than being stuck in a foreign country in the midst of an epidemic with no way to get back home.
"The information that I now have is that ""The Government of Japan will NOT cover the costs associated with treatment during this time, and you will be required to pay out of pocket should an infection occur, and you have no insurance.""https:/…Since WHO declared COVID-19 an Global Pandemic travel insurance companies are not covering incidents related to the Coronavirus. So I guess this means everyone travels at their own risk if they leave their country to visit Japan? Does anyone have information contrary to this?"
"Correction to my above post. The Who organization declared it a Global Emergency. It has not yet been called a ""Pandemic""."
Definitely worth checking with your individual insurance company. I checked with mine and I’m completely covered unless my country announces their own advice against travel.
"""Does anyone have information contrary to this?”Travel Insurance cover, terms and conditions and treatment of claims varies tremendously depending on where the policy was written, the insurance company and the type of cover taken out.Here is a Q&A issued by the Association of British Insurers outlining the stance of their members (i.e.all UK and many European insurers.https:/…If there is a government advisory issue advising against travel to a country then any insurance cover would be invalidated. As far as I am aware, whilst their has been an FCO advisory not to visit China, no such advisory has been issued for Japan so my policy would cover me for a Japan trip but not for China. Clearly, one should check with their insurance provider but it is not true to say that insurers are not covering incidents due to the Corona virus outbreak at least in teh UK and Europe which, it has to be said, does have a far more developed travel insurance industry than say the USA"
We are completely covered by our Quebec-based policy unless there is an official advisory issued by the Canadian government.
Another story about the virus spread ... https:/…
It’s like the mood / feeling changed overnight!? Strange. It’s getting scary here. I haven’t really minded the 80-minute commute on crowded trains but now I’m starting to look around at who’s coughing and how far away I am from them.
This is info from my trusted Travel Insurance broker in USA. It discusses US-based coverage:https:/…
But the diificult part of this is the 'silent' carriers.Once you think it is just like a longer cold it might be easier.The old guy from Hong Kong was the first one who was found on Diamond Princess but we cannot tell if the others who got off before him were virus-free. That ship usually stops twice or three times a month at Yokohama.

"Hi , I have a 9 day trip planned in Japan and I will be travelling from India from 18th to 28th March , our plan includes Tokyo , Kyoto, Okinawa and Osaka , can anyone inform the current conditions in the all these places , flights are non-refundable and I really dont want to cancel this trip, is it worth taking the risk ?"
"Hi, sadly I just cancel my flight for tomorrow. I don’t want to risk my elder parents who’s staying with me. Situation in SG is not so good too.. let’s pray that this whole thing will end soon somehow...“Silent carriers” is no joke.. :("
The Tokyo marathon was cancelled for the public only professional runners.
"I am booked on a return flight via JAL for Narita for first wk April. They are not offering refunds for my route, unfortunately. I checked with my travel insurance in what happens if the flight gets quarantined - they don’t cover this scenario. However since I bought the policy before 30 Jan (this particular insurer’s view of that date where the virus is a known event), they will cover me per insurance policy for medical but if health services there are swamped, having insurance is not going to help much."
"The coronavirus outbreak in Japan had obviously entered a new phase with spreading of the virus, not directly coming from China, among Japanese. Therefore, we now have to be ready for further spreading of the virus. But. we should especially prevent its RAPID spreading in order to keep our hospitals available for patients with severe pneumonia. Thus, the best is to avoid going to crowded places. I now strongly wish schools to be closed for a few weeks and many companies to have their employees work at different times in order to eliminate the Rush Hours in major cities for a few weeks, in addition to cancel Tokyo Marathon for ordinary people and the Emperor's Birthday Greeting at the Imperial Palace. These can help the virus to spread gradually, not rapidly, in Japan. In addition, I initially expected that this virus would disappear when it gets hot in June, just like SARS did in the past. But, it seems I was wrong, because the infection of this virus is still increasing in Singapore and Thailand of which temperature are already more than 30 Celsius degree. I'm worried now about the outbreak still continues even after Summer. We might have to cancel Tokyo Olympic then. Unfortunately, this is the current situation in our country.The only hope I have now is the development of medical treatment. But, we don't know any update on the initial successful treatment with anti-flu drug oseltamivir combined with anti-HIV drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir from Thailand. Many other clinical trials are going on in the world, as follows.https:/…d41586-020-00444-3"
"Some relatively positive news from the Guardian... 80% of those infected only get mild symptoms (study of 44000 cases). This matches earlier reports this week that over 70% of those positive on the Diamond Princess have mild to no symptoms. True, this makes the spread more sly - but it should be of a little comfort that the vast vast majority of people who get this virus will experience it as you would a bad cold and nothing more https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/1…"
"@nestra - yeah, I saw that too. I've been sceptical about the media panic and I'm not trying to downplay the virus and the danger it brings to those at risk, but things need to be looked at in perspective. Coronaviruses are responsible for the majority of common colds, and of course this new strain is a lot more potent at the moment since it's new to the scene. If you're more likely to suffer dangerous complications then yes, keep yourself safe, but equally a common cold, a ""regular"" pneumonia, or flue can and do kill the vulnerable. Just keep your with about you, keep your hygiene up, and don't put your life on hold."
"I'm not making jokes of 'silent carriers.' I was Westerners today and they were coughing so I hand a new mask for the adult, but she was just wearing for some minutes.Even it's just a cold and the climate change is bugging you, if you cough, please wear masks if you have it. We are calling it 'cough etiquettes.'The young girl sitting next to me also cough a few times, I gave up my seat five minutes before I get to Shinjuku. Maybe she couldn't find a mask, but if you have it, please wear it."
"I've got some flights to Japan in May reserved until midday tomorrow, and am currently trying to decide whether the coronavirus situation means I shouldn't book. It's just far enough away that it feels very hard to make an informed decision - it seems equally possible that it could be totally under control by then, or much worse.My main concern is the potential for places to close/events to be cancelled because of it, even if just out of caution (no doubt if there was a high risk of catching it, flights would be cancelled anyway). Obviously this has already happened with the marathon and emperor's birthday event, but I also came across this theatre show that's suspended indefinitely from March due to the virus (http://revue-japan.com/), which makes me wonder if other attractions may do the same.Will be keeping an eye on this thread as I mull it all over."
"Hi dear if u r referring to my post:#293 of 302 ·Hi, sadly I just cancel my flight for tomorrow. I don’t want to risk my elder parents who’s staying with me. Situation in SG is not so good too.. let’s pray that this whole thing will end soon somehow...“Silent carriers” is no joke.. :( <— I never say this was a joke. It was meant to interpret as such: describing a situation as no joke means emphasizing that it is very difficult or unpleasant (situation). Please don’t get me wrong."
"Unfortunately, the reality is* *the 'virus' had landed."" There was a new case on the train line where I live (and travel on). It's no longer a tale from another prefecture or train line. The ""decree"" from the powers-to-be seem to be: wash hands, gargle, wear a mask, stay healthy, build immunity, and avoid crowds. Avoid group events, ie parties and ""events."" That said, I will still take the train to go from A to B, and will continue to go the my gym. My local clinic has a sign that says ""If you have a temperature of 37.5 degrees or higher, please DO NOT come in."" I have friends coming on the 29th and family coming in early April. It's a great time to come. Not many tourists! I am more concerned about the 26 MILLION Americans who have been diagnosed with the ""flu"" and the 14,000 that have died this ""flu season."" Those of us who live in Japan have National Health Insurance. Yes, the flu and The Virus are scary. But we have access to proper health care and hospitals. Keeping fingers crossed that those who are hospitalized with get to go home in time.Edited: 6:50 am, February 18, 2020 "
"Iyla Tan, I understand what you meant but I had to emphatised that I wasn't joking at all.I'm wondering if still limiting just to two provinces of China is OK. Maybe the Japanese government should add more.Singapore is still having more numbers of patients compared to the mainland of Japan.(Diamond Princess is more international than Japan.)　Stay safe.Edited: 7:05 am, February 18, 2020 "
https://www.youtube.com/watch…is this a true reflection of the public health response in Japan at this time?
"I am also very concerned as I'm going to Japan for the first time, on a longed for and planned hard trip, in May. From what I understand masks protect other people from any germs/ infections you might have they don't protect the wearer. Hand washing and cleansing with gels gives the most protection. I agree if you're on the islands or in less populated areas you will be less likely to rub shoulders with people that might be infected. This virus is much more infectious than Sars which fizzled out in a few months. I think we have to wait and take advice from the WHO, travel agents and our holiday insurers nearer the time of travel. Let's hope Japan contains and controls it their economy could be seriously damaged by tourists staying away."
https://www.singaporeair.com/saar5/pdf/media…SQ announced cancel of flights to Haneda and Narita on the above date.
"Over 13,000 people now completely recovered as per the John Hopkins WHO tracker. As with any flu, full recovery can take weeks, and as there was a huge spike in infections as a lot of incubation periods finished around the same time, I think we will see a huge spike in recoveries over the next few weeks as more and more people get over it. Not to downplay the seriousness as @grey suitcases also said, but it’s worth reminding ourselves of the context here. There are real risks of hospitals getting overcrowded however (I know the UK struggles with this every flu season as it is), so measures around stopping spread are important."
"The 454 cruiseliner cases are contained onboard and virtually irrelevant so long as conditions do not change for breakout to accelerate and cause an exponential increase mainland infections. The current 66 cases up from 29 several days ago are still clearly not yet an indication of exponential, uncontrolled and large spread. See real-time figures here https:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6However, be watchful and understand all WHO precautions and advice here https:/…novel-coronavirus-2019For those struggling to understand, masks help to reduce breathing in potential infection droplets as well as expelling them, likewise hand washing helps transferring virus into the body from surfaces, as does behavioural measures like trying to avoid crowds and situations. All of them together help to reduce chances of infection and are not 100% solutions.The current media reports on puzzling issues and cases are causing alarm in the minds of many when in practice the current minor infection breakout into the wider community are still comparatively very small and most cases are related to health care workers treating patients. The few inexplicable cases are currently even still to few incidents to result in panic decisions and some comments expressed above. Having said that and not trying to sound too insensitive it is very understandable that people will be feeling very uncomfortable and rethinking their plans for fear of infection however low very low risk but more likely due to travel disruptions."
Hello me and my parents (60 y.o) will also not cancel our trip to Japan on 9 April 2020 since we already bought All the airplane tickets and all the hotel (they don’t accept refund) so if we cancel all money invested in this trip will be gone.. we are using japan airlines transit from Kuala Lumpur to narita airport (I hope there’re no travel warning in KL and Japan) I already take care my health by drinking Vit C supplement.. my father worried when we go to Japan there will be no one around (less people going out) and I heard Japanese now started working at home.
How is the situation and the mood in Tokyo now?
@bonjourpeony you probablyCould get a refund. Airlines are refunding runners affected by the cancellation of the Tokyo marathon.
"Ana, it’s still “business as usual” in Tokyo I’m hearing from friends but they’re getting a little nervous.The international news today has been reporting about the complete failure of the quarantine on the ship and how shocking it is that Japanese passengers are just going home so people are talking about the possibility that those passengers are now spreading the virus around Japan."
"@kobekeith thank you for the insider view. As much as I would like to proceed with my plans, I have to start looking for the plan B."
"Listen to what the CDC says:https:/…index.html*At this time, the extent of virus spread is not sustained or widespread enough to meet the criteria for a travel notice.*"
"But many IT companies shifted to use Telework to avoid the packed trains.There is no telling of how many more cases will be reported tomorrow.Edited: 10:01 pm, February 19, 2020 "
"You’re welcome, Ana... As stated above, it’s now a wait and see what happens next situation as people go about their lives as usual. The two salarymen who enter my train from opposite ends of the car EVERY morning and then hover over my seat anticipating me getting up 2 stops later didn’t need to wrestle each other for the seat because there were at least 10 open seats this morning on my train and no one standing up so maybe people are starting to work from home in order to avoid crowded situations or to alleviate the crowds."
"Interesting re the comment on effectiveness of quarantine on the Diamond Princess. Australia has brought a plane load of pax home from the ship - on arrival they all immediately entered mandatory quarantine, in a mining camp in Darwin, for another two weeks."
"I am flying to Japan for the first time on the 29th February (just 9 days, arrrghh!) and I am changing my plans to visit places like Hiroshima and Miyajima instead of Kyoto and Tokyo, in order to avoid crowds and busy public transport. Maybe it's paranoia, but I worry about bringing it back to Spain and infecting my family, more than being sick myself. I was wondering whether the onsen baths in hotels etc are best avoided? What do you all think?"
"#316 agree with good post and CDC link not currently declaring travel warning to Japan as with 84 infection cases so far in 125,000,000 country population on the mainland it does not justify the level of panic so far shown by many in this thread.This should hopefully guide people’s thinking from here on until situation report changes. #320 with this in mind other potential more common diseases than Corvid-19 like legionella pneumonia should be of more concern, with around 1600 cases annually in Japan, see here https://www.researchgate.net/publication/823… which has a much higher 10% fatality. General science articles indicate virus mostly do not survive in water temperature of around 40 C and above.Edited: 9:09 am, February 20, 2020 "
"Outsiders' opinions will differ with the locals actually living here.It is becoming horrifying that maybe somebody on the same train might have the virus and spreading it..If not, why some companies start letting their employees work from home?"
"Seems like I'm on the fence too regarding travelling to Japan. My initial trip to Tokyo was end of Jan 2020 and to Sapporo in Feb for the snow festival. Japan already had a few cases at that time and thought the situation would improve after a month so we decided to reschedule our trip 1 month later, which would be this coming 27th Feb! Had to spend thousands of $$ to change flight tickets from Malaysia to Tokyo for my family of 9. And could only get 50% refund for our Sapporo flight. Thankfully 3 out of 4 hotels had free cancellation.But the recent spike in no. of infections in Japan has got me extra worried. Read in the news somewhere that Japanese citizens onboard the cruise who show no symptoms are allowed to go home without having to go through another round of self-quarantine.The no. of infection is at 92 now but once all the remaining cruise passengers are released by month end, I have a feeling the numbers will increase drastically. Now I'm more inclined towards cancelling this trip altogether and just postpone it to next year. That would mean extra financial loss for me because I would need to re-book all the flights again =(. But then again I wouldn't jeopardise the wellbeing of my family as my parents are in their 60s and my niece is 5 years old.It's like darn if you do, darn if you don't kind of situation.Anyone in Japan now willing to share updates on the current situation over there? Really hope the outbreak will be contained and will keep praying for everyone's safety."
"To repeat #316 post (who is a medical doctor) CDC USA’s prime government authority Centre for Disease Control saying https:/…index.html*At this time, the extent of virus spread is not sustained or widespread enough to meet the criteria for a travel notice.*The World Health Authority is also not warning to travel to Japan here https:/… Two most important and reputable authorities in the world saying similar vs the individuals concerns and some but not all workplaces choosing to work from home, though understandable and each has a choice to minimise chances to near zero for infection or the belief in mind to that affect. The cruise ships are all but mostly unrelated being quarantined and monitored and reports of dormant virus carriers are not currently known to be in large numbers and therefore of minimal risk at this stage."
"I don’t usually agree with Global but on this thread I do. Everyone can keep googling their answers to encourage total strangers to not cancel their plans but things are changing here this week. The people on the cruise ship who were diagnosed with the virus were sent to hospitals. So the person telling everyone that those numbers don’t count is wrong. The other passengers from japan are going home. No more quarantine. This hasn’t really helped the mood among the people who are actually living here. I don’t usually use hand sanitizer but thought I should start “just in case” and the shelves are empty. Face masks too. Empty shelves. People are starting to stock up on toilet paper and food that will last a month or so. This is what’s happening among people living here. Public schools are starting to address the possibility of shutting down. That was yesterday in Kōbe. Maybe it’s over precaution and paranoia or panic and totally unnecessary because we can compare the statistics by Googling other illnesses with higher death rates but this is just what’s starting to happen here in Japan. My train to Kōbe from Kyōto had less people on it than usual yesterday but the night train back was during peak rush hour and it seemed pretty full. So, rational advice may no longer apply when people start to react the way they are starting to. People are still going out to eat and going to bars and other normal every day life is going on but it’s not exactly the same as usual right now. People are preparing for the worst, just in case."
You’re welcome... I was downplaying it a while back in my posts and enjoying less people in Kyōto but now I’m thinking “maybe I’ll stay in this weekend” just in case. It’s Friday though so who knows what I’ll be thinking in about 12 hours from now. :) TGIF
"well after sitting on the fence for a few weeks we made the call today to not travel to Tokyo in March (10-19). This is finally based on the idiotic (to us) decision to allow people off of the cruise ship and allow them to go where they want while there are still new confirmed cases daily on the ship.. Many disembarking took taxis and hired cars from the ship. I can only assume that many are now enjoying their freedom by staying at hotels and eating out while traveling over the city and waiting for flights home or to other vacation destinations. I refuse to believe that they are all free of the virus, and by the reactions of many governments imposing a 14 day quarantine on them before allowing them into their countries I am not alone. I fear that in 2-3 weeks Tokyo is going to see a rapid increase in infections. (I hope that I am wrong). Our final decision to cancel (with the total sizeable loss of the cost of our vacation package) was based on the possibility of being quarantined either upon arrival in Japan or on return home for having cold/flu symptoms. Both of us currently have head colds and coughs and it is not worth the risk of losing both the vacation (if quarantined in Tokyo) or our jobs (if at home). Losing a further 2-4 weeks of pay or our jobs would be catastrophic financially. I respect everyone's input and everyone needs to respect that every one of us is in different situations and that one choice (to visit or cancell) may fit me but not others. Those traveling keep safe and stay healthy, those cancelling , hopefully like us you will plan a trip to Tokyo in the future when the current situation is contained. Which I feel is currently not the case."
"Here’s something I wrote on another thread — and I’ve added a new info that I heard today. This link hasn't been updated as there are now 3 deaths. The first was a woman from Sagamihara in her 80's who was diagnosed AFTER she died. The other two who died yesterday were passengers on the Diamond Princess. The man, 87, from Kanagawa prefecture had a heart and lung condition and said he had a hard time breathing on the 5th, but they didn’t take him off the ship until the 13th. The woman from Tokyo who was 84 had no chronic illnesses, but had a fever, diarrhea, and was vomiting soon after the boat docked, but didn’t also get hospitalized until a week later. Obviously, it’s failure on part of the staff that were supposed to figure out who needed immediate medical attention. There are also a few more people from the ship who are in serious condition at the hospitals. Ages range from 60’s to 80’s. https:/…There are some events that have been cancelled, and the government is asking everyone to use ""caution,"" especially at indoor events/meetings where there are lots of strangers. I work out at a fitness center several times a week. No one wears a mask -- it's hard to do aerobic exercises if you can't breathe! People still go out to eat with their friends and family. Life goes on. Wash hands, gargle, wear a mask when you're in a crowd, eat well, sleep well, keep your immunity up. I would say 50% of the people who are walking about wear masks. 50% don't. There are still many tourists all over.(Some wear masks, some don't.) Just not many Chinese groups. It feels like ""tourism"" from several years ago. You don't have to fight the crowds! Many temples and shrines have taken off the ""bells"" and closed off the purifying water for drinking.I’ve noticed people are avoiding touching each other, especially for those they don’t know well. No shaking hands for “nice to meet you.” But bowing works! Back to ""tradition""! Just an update from Tokyo. February 21, 2020.Edited: 5:59 pm, February 20, 2020 "
"Well, here we go, Japan is Watch Level 1 now per CDC:https:/…coronavirus-japan"
Oh.. And close your toilet seats when you flush! (It really helps keep the bathroom clean!) It's been mentioned by several virus specializing doctors in Japan. https:/…
"Kobekeith, I just wanted to restate what another poster said, thank you for your honest assessment of the situation and please continue to let us know what is going on locally. I am sure many people are waiting to see how things continue to develop in Japan before determining what to do about pending vacation, myself included. I am hopeful Japan gets this under control."
"Karen D, you’re welcome. I’ve been accused of being too paranoid but I’m just telling people about what’s actually happening here as opposed to what would be more rational to others who are not here. I was making light of it about two weeks ago and my posts were not expressing panicked advice. I too have a flight booked from Japan to Europe on March 15 and hoping it’ll be OK to go and then return 3 weeks later. If were actually paranoid I’d have already cancelled my flights."
"I am due to fly out on Sunday. At this stage we are going, and not planning on cancelling. We have antibacterial gel, antibacterial wipes and masks. To be honest, I am getting more concerned with each passing day, but both my husband and I are fit and healthy and middle aged (I hate saying that - middle aged!) so we are confident that we will be ok. My gut feeling is to go, and both Smart Traveller (Aus government site) and the CDC are both saying to not cancel - so Japan, here we come (unless something changes in the next 48 hours)."
Bring extra of everything because locals can’t get it. Unless they’re lucky. Many people on TripAdvisor always ask what they should bring from their home country as gifts. Tiny bottles of hand sanitizer would be greatly appreciated at this point or packets of anti bacterial wipes and so on. Especially if you happen to be in Kyōto next week and need a bar tour or cake break and want some “hidden gems” revealed and then “someone” would be very grateful for the gesture. :)
"Thanks kobekeith, I'll stock up on these before we leave (to bring as pressies!). We will be in Kyoto next week - there for 5 nights.We're still so excited about this holiday, it has been planned since June last year. Nervous, yes, but definitely excited!"
The bright side is that it’s really quiet and feels like it used to feel in February years ago before japan became such a popular destination.
"#329, Anthony T, Yes, I was also surprised and very irritated that Japan decided not to quarantine the people that got off the diamond princess. It will be interesting to see how many cases are found in the quarantined people from the other countries that decided to quarantine as well as the number of cases in Japan in 2-3 weeks. Being quarantined is also my greatest concern, other than work, I have reasons I can not be away longer."
I just read a report that Tokyo has canceled major indoor events for the next 3 weeks. Is this true? Can anyone name specific events? Would you say this is unusual (someone on Twitter made it sound like this may have occurred before during bad flu seasons)?
I just checked the Japanese news and confirmed it with teachers near me. All indoor events and large gatherings with food are cancelled or postponed thru March 15. Nothing specific was named in what we read. Graduation ceremonies and entrance exams are not cancelled and all preventative cautions must be taken. It’s just Tokyo right now. I have concert tickets and back stage passes for a show in OSAKA next week but i think it’s still going on.
"Does anyone have an update on compulsory quarantine for travellers showing symptoms of coronavirus? I mean, surely they wouldn’t quarantine or test every person coming in with a head cold or runny nose? Those are such common and frequent symptoms."
"Many experts in infectious diseases in Japan now say that we are in ""the Stage of Intra-city Spreading of the Virus"", but ""its Early Stage"". So, it depends on individual whether to visit Japan or to stay home. It may be worse in Spring or even in Summer. Although I hope it to end from hotter countries in the world, such as Singapore, Thailand, it seems it more depends on the emergence of effective therapy against the virus than the weather."
@James I just received a message telling me that an event in Osaka I was meant to attend next week has been cancelled because the governor of Osaka has made an announcement similar to the Tokyo one about canceling events for the next month. :(
Event after event are being cancelled now. The Kyōto Wine Festival on March 8. An Anime event or convention. My friend works for a rum distributor from Europe and their events were just cancelled. A camera event in Yokohama too. Another friend works for a company that imports jewelry from Italy and their sales events have been cancelled. That’s all in the last few hours.
"Lisa - I don’t think there has been anything about this since the press release on Feb 13th. It wasn’t really expanded on, but there certainly haven’t been any cases of planes being quarantined on arrival in the news. It’s unlikely that there have been no regular head colds arriving to Japan this last week, so I imagine there is sensible caution being taken. The WHO website has published the official advice it has given governments regarding quarantine, and there is a paragraph which asks countries to be considerate that it is regular flu season for the Northern Hemisphere and so care should be taken not to assume everyone with a cold has covid-19. Perhaps this is why there is such a focus on fever in testing"
"Even the passengers are not officially quaratined any more, the Ministry is making phone calls and requesting them to stay home as much as they can without going out.But they haven't done anything with the passengers who disembarked the Diamond Princess the former cruise. Judging from the first Hong Kong case, it could have been there from the January cruise.Thanks to that Hong Kong case, it was discovered before more than 600 carriers landed without precautions."
"At the airport, they have thermo-censors. So if you have a fever, you will be stopped by the officiers. I guess that's they found that the American woman was detected when she got off the plane at Indonesia(?).I guess they made regulations just in case when they detect multiple people with fever."
I m also traveling to Japan on the 16 March. I am anxious as the numbers are getting higher and higher. But I’d also be so bummed if the trip gets cancelled because me and husband have been planning this for so long. (We have cancelled the trip before as I got pregnant unexpectedly).
"Thanks for the update keith! It seems things are getting a little more ""serious"" shall we say?My trip is not until March 28th. Up until a few days ago I was 99.9% sure I would still be going but now I am not so sure. I don't want to be victim of hysteria, I understand the risk of contracting the virus is still very low and I am not in a risky demographic, but I feel there are now more factors one must take into consideration when deciding if to continue one's trip. If tons of places start closing and people are being asked to stay home, I have to wonder how enjoyable that would be if one is supposed to be on vacation. It's just a tough call right now. I am going to continue to monitor the situation. I figure I have at least another month before I need to make a final call and a lot can happen by then."
You’re welcome James... hopefully it won’t get worse but it seems like the paranoia is starting to spread too. I’m in the same situation with my March 15 departure to Europe. Hanging on to my reservations for now. Fingers crossed.
"It’s a decision everyone has to make for himself/herslf. Our tolerence for risk, our interpretation of the situation, our priorities, our personality, etc they are all different. For me, i just ask is this a must-go trip? Nope. It’s just a holiday. I can go again another day, maybe just months down the road when the situation will hopefully have died down. The cancellation costs i take it as a small price to pay for some peace of mind. Last thing i want going on a holiday is to have to keep worrying about something.One thing though, the situation is evolving very rapidly with each day. If you make a decision to go today because things look acceptable to you now, have you thought what might be the worst case scenario when you are there. Who’s to say things might not explode into a nightmarish scenarios when flights are cancelled and international borders closed. Albeit slim chance, but do you really want to take this risk just for a holiday? Not me."
Those people liberated from the cruise will only spread the s* at the fan within more or less 14 days. We whom are going in early march can be in real trouble if something worse happens while we are there =(
"We are leaving March 10 for a 14 day trip through Japan. Also my fear that temples, shrines,etc, may close if things get out of hand after we've entered the country. Booked eveything last July so cancelling now for us not a real option. Fingers crossed that the situation will remain ""under control"". Keeping up to date by reading Japanese newspapers daily , plus all the valuable contributions of those in Japan at the moment truely helps !"
"William have to think the government will be very careful not to over react as the cherry blossoms festivals should begin late Mar thru mid Apr. it will kill revenue for virtually every business. I'm going to Kyoto for 2 weeks starting March 25 and I have no intention of not going. Let's hope it's contained so everyone can enjoy this beautiful time, my 3rd one!!!"
"We have also booked to go beginning of April. We will not get any money back unless the Foreign and Commonwealth Office advise against travel or the tour company cancels the tour.Have been more worried since the Japanese have allowed the cruise passengers just to walk free. Feel we have to stick with it for the moment, but all the joy of looking forward to it has gone, it has just become a worry..It is possible that the tour could change quite a bit as fairly reliant on public transport and all the tourist spots being open.Still I guess it is a minor problem compared to the suffering of many others."
"As many said above, the decision to go or not is a very personal decision based on many factors including health concerns and financial considerations. My wife and I have 14 days of independent travel in Japan planned, arriving 7 April. Just yesterday morning we reevaluated whether to continue with our plans or pull out of the trip now. We've decided to continue, but will keep the option to not go open. Most, if not all, of our hotels are still cancel-able without incurring a fee and since we'd get hit with airline cancellation fees now, as well as later - unless JAL cancels our flights, we decided now is not the time to back out. Also hoping that if there is an increase in virus cases from the cruise ship passengers, or otherwise, that the government would have that under control by early April.While catching the COVID-19 virus in Japan is of course a concern (just as getting the flu here in San Diego is), my bigger concern is that the country could be shut down where tourist sites can't be visited and travel between cities becomes difficult in order to stop the virus spread, with the goal of mitigating the impact to tourism later in the year for the Olympics."
"We purchased travel insurance, we will get back 100% of our money. We are traveling with three children, (6,13,14). I was confident we will be fine, but I do fear that those passenger that were able to disembark from the cruise will also help to spread the virus. We are scheduled to arrive the first week of April. As of right now, I am searching for European destinations before calling and cancelling our trip. I have invested so much time into planning this trip. I am heart broken."
I was all fine to travel next week a week ago. The fact Japan has allowed those off the ship into the general population in worrying. Not to mention Chinese are now using places like Japan for two weeks to avoid quarantine rules getting into Australia. My recent bout of bronchitis would put me at risk. Hubbie still wants to go. If you live in Perth and travelling soon and can't get masks PM me. We have a few spare. Hubbie is bringing home respirator masks from work.Caz
"The question I face (with a month-long trip to Japan coming end of March) is whether I will feel comfortable at the sushi bar, with dinner barehanded to me over the counter. Whether I will feel comfortable in an onsen. What it will feel like on trains and buses day after day. The issue is not exactly how to be safe -- there are methods for that, but whether I will have to limit what I do for what will be my first and only trip to Japan."
"Yes, we have about 3 weeks before we have to cancel. We booked a Kumano Kodo hike through a community-based booking system, and that has a 20-day deadline. All our hotels can be canceled within 3-4 days in advance. Not sure what will be with our plane tix, as they can't be canceled. Have to see what the airlines and the discount packager we bought from will do. We may have recourse through our credit card co, have to see. We did buy AIG travel insurance fairly cheaply, but not the 'cancel for any reason' kind. However, if we have to cancel now, we will go another time. Good luck to you figuring out your trip.Edited: 5:08 pm, February 21, 2020 "
"The media is interviewing the Japanese who tested negative and disembarked the Diamond Princess. They said that they didn't want to risk their family or friends so they were going to stay home. The lady who were tweeting from the ship wrote that she would go to their Summer villa for two weeks.  I'm not sure about the Matthew Smith and his wife is doing.Rather than the ship, untraceable patients are reported every day."
My kid has a four week study abroad this June-July planned. I’ve been telling myself the worst will be passed by then but I’m starting to worry. I’m going to go they the fine print on the insurance the school carries this weekend. No one with the school has said anything about it yet. I think I need to have a lot of “what if” conversations with my 19 year old.
Nobody could tell about June and July yet.
"Yes, I have no expectation that AIG will cover us. I bought the insurance for health coverage while in Japan and for evac. like you. We'll all have to stay tuned as the next weeks go by."
Also check the CDC well. They are mentioning the corona virus might be already among the people who died of the flu.
"I'm booked to fly out from Australia on March 30 for a 3 week trip. Like so many others, I'm in the ""wait and see"" stage, but I admit I'm feeling more and more unsure about it as the days go by. Again, like others, my concern is not about contracting the virus (statistically highly unlikely) but whether a trip at this time will actually be enjoyable or overshadowed by worry about things like potential quarantine on arrival or return, as well as the possibility that events and sites may be cancelled / closed. I've been to Japan many times and will absolutely visit in the future if I end up cancelling this time. I'd be sad to cancel but I'm mentally preparing for it!"
"I enjoyed Kamakura, popular among both tourists and Japanese, with only one fourth or less crowd yesterday."
"Kobekeith - completely off topic, but I just wanted to let you know that I still pass on to everyone your excellent advice (from years ago) about the best way to spend a day in Arashiyama. So thanks from me and various family and friends!"
"For information - Australian vaccine testing has started. It's not a ""quick"" fix though.https://www.theage.com.au/national/australia…"
"Wow ... thanks for that MomPlusOne. You’re very welcome. :)I was a mountain bike tour guide in Colorado a long time ago and people nicknamed a series of trails after me and still call it the “something” loop now (my last name) as it linked together parts of a few different trails that were the most fun and with the best views. That surprises me because it was over 20 years ago when i was just a student!Edited: 7:04 pm, February 21, 2020 "
Am now in doubts about my trip to Sapporo after the rise in number of cases of COVID-19Am meant to go on Wednesday for 9 days... anyone else planning the same?
Nestra - I'll send it via private message. :)
Mumplusone I need to know too! :)
"Favipiravir, a new drug for influenza discovered in Japan, was recently found to be effective for new coronavirus COVID-19 in its clinical trial in China. The Japanese Prime Minister Abe ordered Japanese Government to encourage the wide use of this drug also in Japan, as I wrote here. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29423…Therefore, we might finally obtain the resolution for this virus soon!!"
"Mumplusone and kobekeith, I’d love to know too (please)! Thanks mabei for that link."
Does anyone know where the Japanese people that have been allowed to leave the Diamond Princess are going? All other passengers flown home are being quarantined in their home countries but it looks like Japan is not quarantining it’s nationals? Is this not risking spread? Why not quarantine them like every other country?
"Hi, Mr. Shot,I knew the news from CDC, but I will be surprised and shocked if any influenza in the U.S.A. is caused by the coronavirus. It would not be possible. A promising news is that Favipiravir have just emerged as a promising anti-coronavirus drug!!It demonstrated encouraging results in a clinical trial which involved 70 patients with coronavirus COVID-19 infection in China. Other drugs are also tested in clinical trains in China now, such as anti-malaria drug, chloroquine, and Gilead’s experimental drug, remdesivir. But, I think as a Researcher worked for viral disease for 25 years, that Favipiravir is the most promising drug among these, as follows.It was a new drug for influenza discovered and made in Japan, as follows.https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/130005881888/However, it works as a chain terminator inhibiting the synthesis of RNA of various viruses and indeed it was found later to be effective for VARIOUS VIRAL INFECTION including Ebola virus, etc. as follows. https:/…Japanese Prime Minister Abe also ordered Japanese Government yesterday to promote the wide use of this drug in Japan. Therefore, we might finally obtain the solution for this virus soon!!This drug was approved as anti-flu drug in 2014 in Japan, but due to its concern for teratogenesis, it has not been not widely used, and only used for selected cases with flu in Japan. But, it may be good for coronavirus infection, except for pregnant women."
"I think I also something on the CDC page itself.https://president.jp/articles/-/33051?page=2There is also a counter article against this hypothesis.https:/…Anyway, CDC will start testing more patients.https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/5…Edited: 6:29 am, February 22, 2020 "
Hey Jeff. We are flying Saturday and heading to sapporo on Thurs. I would fill my comfortable in sapporo. Not the mass of humanity that's in Tokyo. I looked at totally changing our itinerary to Canada but hubbie is not on board. Said we have the proper masks. Wash hands constantly with sanitizer and we should be ok.

#385- japan has already failed with the cruise ship so it doesn’t really matter anymore. The people were allowed to just scatter around Japan after leaving the ship. So shameful compared to other countries.
"We have finally made the decision to cancel our upcoming trip to Kyoto and Tokyo for the first two weeks of March. If we are quarantined because someone on our flight home tests positive, the economic impact on our family would be significant. Additionally, my spouse is an ER doctor who works with vulnerable populations, and the thought of him potentially spreading the virus —though unlikely—gives us pause.Ultimately, we prefer not to visit Japan when people are feeling worried and stressed. I'm very sad about this, as we have been planning our trip since last July. However, it's a small inconvenience compared to those who are living in the midst of an outbreak. In the meantime, I hope Japan is able to contain Covid-19 and my thoughts and wishes are with the population."
And I just read this.https:/…
"Bitterpapaya, “it’s not discrimination” discrimination is kind of the norm in Japan. Corona virus is just an excuse to put up the signs to make it clearer now.Foreigners just learn to roll with the punches. It’s not a big deal.Edited: 10:47 am, February 22, 2020 "
"Yea, kobekeith. I have a near perfect image of japan. I love visiting it because this is the most hospitable and civil people, without a doubt. I guess civilities are a learned thing that sets culture apart but basic human instincts are universal. We are all the same. In desperate times, they will surface."
"Bitterpapaya, that’s the thing. It’s just the image on the surface. Once you get beneath that, the truths are discovered. We’re going to get buried in more garbled and rambling nonsensical posts if we try to discuss the failings anymore."
"Hfot2 , nothing is surprising anymore with the ineptness playing out every day and being witnessed by the entire world. But I’m sure the Olympic Games will go off without a hitch. The years and years of practicing the same exact thing over and over again will be a success. Unfortunately the corona virus wasn’t rehearsed so it’s all a huge mess."
Both Department of State and CDC raised Japan travel alert to level 2 now. https:/…coronavirus-japan
"Thanks for this update. Have been following this topic very closely. Have to travel on the 3rd of March. Long pre planned holiday. Till it was alert-1, we were still thinking of going ahead with our plans. But now with the Level-2 alert, I'm getting anxious and may cancel soon :( ...We'll take a final call in another two days."
I guess we are canceling. My spouse's doctors will tell him not to travel I'm sure with the higher alert :(. I've been planning our trip for months. :(
"If I remember correctly, your spouse takes immunosuppressants? If he's my patient, I'd advice to postpone your trip. With the Alert Level 2 in place, most airlines would waive the cancellation/change fee. Stay healthy and go to Japan when there are no public health issues. As of now some attractions are closed and events are cancelled, so not the most fun time to go anyway."
"Yes, he really can't risk catching things like this. We are pretty disappointed but at least we should get all our money back or most at least at this point. The most important thing is safety. Hopefully the outbreak doesn't end up being severe in Japan."
"""My spouse's doctors will tell him not to travel I'm sure with the higher alert"" sorry to hear that but for people with underlying medical conditions its more risky. I would still be comfortable going to Japan but I don't think I would want to put a family member at risk if they had underlying conditions. Not for non-essential travel. Do make sure to plan another trip to Japan when things settle down though because it is worth visiting."
"Supposed to be travelling with family on 6th April for a 14 day stay, but not feeling too positive it'll happen now.Like so many others, I have been watching closely since this has been going on in Japan and the overall picture seems to be one of decline. I feel this will continue, perhaps even to the point where governments issue advice against non essential travel to Japan. Currently, we still have five or more weeks before we are due to travel, so we can sit tight and see how things develop. However, it may take a miracle for the picture not to become even more ugly than it is right now, which is a depressing thought. Everything considered, it just seems foolish to place ourselves in what is essentially an unpredictable, potentially very inconvenient and even highly dangerous situation by choice. On that basis, I am virtually sure we will not be going. As others have already said, it is massively disappointing to miss out on visiting a fabulously interesting country, that none of us have ever visited previously. Will keep watching, but in the meantime I know I speak for our small group when I say good luck to all who do travel, and most importantly, that we hope for a resolution as soon as possible for the people of Japan and all other affected countries."
"We arrived in Tokyo yesterday. Like many of you we were concerned about taking this long planned holiday but would have lost all the money if we cancelled. We have had a great first day and our anxieties have lessened considerably. Our flight was half empty due to lots of cancellations but we sailed through immigration with no problems. The train from the airport was busy but not mobbed, about half TV e occupants wearing masks. We visited Shibuya crossing which seemed quieter than we expected but there are still crowds of people out and about and on the metro. Whether that will change over the next couple of weeks remains to be seen but so far so good- glad we didn’t cancel"

"I was supposed to travel in April, but I just canceled. I take Humira for my Psoriasis, so my immune system isn’t as strong as it was. Just wasn’t worth the risk. I hope to be able to go next spring!"
“The State Department has a threat level 2 alert for Belgium” is the same as the CDC threat level 2 for the health crisis in Japan?!
"I think what gatormotherof2 is trying to say is that government agencies sometimes err on the side of caution, when in reality the threat is arguably more limited.But... I'm not sure a terrorist threat poses quite the same ""broad"" spectrum of problems as this or, another potentially serious illness does, both to individuals and to wider commercial enterprises."
"Maria@labamba2020, thank you for the update. Please continue your posts. We are going there on March 12, and really would like to proceed with our trip. Thank you!"
"I'm traveling to Japan on March 4th & with all the stuff going w/ the coronavirus, I've been getting anxious about goin. Seeing Maria's post about Tokyo right now was a little reassuring but the thought of all the financial burdens with virus & border controls scare me. I'm so sad & I really dont want to cancel. But idk :( what do you think?"
"There’s no way anyone can tell you what’s the best thing for you to do. We all have a different level of risk tolerance. What is your situation? Are you healthy and young- ish? Do you have some financial cushion in case you get trapped somewhere? Are you traveling with kids? A lot of people are saying that they are not necessarily concerned with contracting the virus as much as panic setting in, potential for quarantine, borders being closed and being somewhere where people are more and more fearful, not to mention closure of tourist attractions canceling of festivals etc. When I read about a teacher in a middle school in Japan going to school for a week with a fever who then tested positive for the virus and people getting off the cruise ship and then oops they didn’t remember to test 23 of them before they left to make sure they were negative etc. etc. It’s hard not to imagine a scenario where these people infect more people and they infect more people etc. Again even if it amounts to 500 people out of 130 million your chance is not great to get sick but more cases will mean more fear and more of a chance that travel alert levels will go up and flights will get canceled etc. etc."
"In Japan, the first dead case with the coronavirus was a lady in her 80s without Chinese connection. After she died, she had the PCR test. Without knowing she had the infectious virus, the nurse got the virus too and she spreaded to some patients.I guess more cases will be found in the States too."
"Yeah I understand. I'm just indecisive & trying to find as much information as possible to make my decision. My friend and I are traveling to Japan March 4 to Tokyo > Osaka > then to South Korea for 4 days (thurs-monday) > Kyoto > Tokyo > Fly home. We're pretty healthy, in our early 20s, going to celebrate our college graduation. As college graduates, of course, we don't have much financial cushion & our families aren't well off either. I agree with everyone that I am not necessarily concerned with contracting the illness. It's not a matter of contracting the illness, but the financial burdens of contracting it & the issues that could occur if we cannot go back home. It's a battle between the cancelling & losing money based on possibilities & risks or taking that risk"
"We’re currently having a 3-day weekend and Kōbe was pretty busy on Saturday and things there haven’t been cancelled yet. Saturday night in Kyōto was busier than the last two weekends with mostly Japanese people in the Kiyamachi bar area. I keep thinking “I should stay home” but then my friends text me about a Nara Brewery event in Kyōto and I just go out. We actually had to skip 2 bars on our pub crawl because they were full. In the 5th and final bar, we were at a big shared space and there was a group of 6 younger Japanese people who asked “where are you from” to our group seated across from them and corona came up when the “Master”/owner and the other bartender were standing there and everyone was laughing about it. They said that all of their friends and apparently they’re discussing it on Japanese Twitter that they’re sick of all of the news and it’s not a big deal to them because “only old people die” so they’re done worrying about it. They even said darker things that weren’t meant to be jokes. But the shock of the bluntness was making people laugh. “Old people die anyway. They will maybe get cancer or have a heart attack so this is what will kill them.”My students in my school have also made similar jokes or remarks about having nothing to worry about so I guess that’s why the bars were hopping last night. I was with 8 elderly Japanese people in the afternoon on Saturday in Kōbe and they said it’s scary but they aren’t too worried about it either. “I believe Japan medicine” is a direct quote from a guy who is 72. I think he meant that he “trusts” the medicine here and isn’t worried either. If you are still coming here, please bring face masks and hand sanitizers and other things like that because they’re hard for people living here to find. There were European tourists at a bar last night saying how they lucked out and got masks at a store that was putting them out in the middle of the day on Friday. So they had a jump on all of the people living here who were at work or they took those masks out of the hands of elderly people in the neighborhood who didn’t have good timing. That’s a “selfish” thing on part of the tourists showing up here during this epidemic unprepared. I saw people being called “selfish” on another thread and thought about that now.Edited: 8:18 pm, February 22, 2020 "
#420Watch the US policy of travelling to Japan and Sourh Korean.They might raise the level soon especially against travelling to South Korea wirh a sharp increase in numbers.
"What's the word 'on the street'... are the locals welcoming tourists ??Face masks have been difficult to find here in Australia due to the hazardous bushfires we have been experiencing over the past months but hoping to be able to gather a good supply, not only for personal use in Japan but to gift them as well."
They will welcome tourists as usual.I saw a group of Australians wearing medical masks on the train yesterday. They will be sold out in Japan.
"SmooOz, Do you want the truth/ reality or the shiny image that some people want it to be? Or the coverup that is springing leaks nowadays?"
"Hi Smoo.Where abouts are you in oz and when are you going? Masks as in the surgical type are impossible to get in Perth. We have been trying to buy them for work. Manufacturers don't even have them. I ordered a box through my chemist 2 weeks ago. They managed to get some but rationing them. We got 5. Luckily my husband works in mining. Asked if he could take a few respirator type for the trip. Got given more than we need. I would be happy to post some to you or if you live in Perth happy for you to pick them up. If not I will take what we have and give to hotel staff. Also hand sanitizer is hard to find. As a previous poster said let's do our best to take with us what we need so we aren't taking the limited supplies the locals have and as you said if we can find them here let's take extras CazEdited: 11:41 pm, February 22, 2020 "
"Hi KobeKeith, I had a feeling that most locals would prefer everyone to stay away so I gather I won't be expecting a 'red carpet ceremony' upon arrival ...Hi Caz, Thank you for your lovely offer regarding the masks. I happen to locate 4 respirator type from local hardware. No one is giving up or out surgical masks here on the East Coast of Oz.Travel plans are for the end of March and April....depending.... and you?PS.. on a technical note ...I dont understand why my Tripadvisor Account is different on my previous post KobeKeith thank you for keeping us up to date and informed about the current mood of the situation...Please take careEdited: 2:36 am, February 23, 2020 "
Glad you found some Smoo. We fly out Saturday. Bit of travelling. Bit of skiing. Looking forward to it.
"@ gatormotherof2.... re post 417My statement about ""government agencies"" in post 414 was more in defense of your previous post where you appear to make a comparison to the raising of the threat level in Belgium. It was not suggesting that those ""agencies"" are correct, accurate or always well timed in offering advice to the public of any / all relevant countries. I'm sure many of us are aware of how the agencies of our relative countries ""can"" seem to take their eyes off the ball on occasion, while at other times, provide advice or guidance that could be construed as alarmist."
"I'm taking a moment to wish/pray/hope that our political leaders and public health experts find clarity and wisdom in this difficult time, and to express support for those who are working at great risk to promote public health."
"Hello Everyone, On March 11 we are arriving in Tokyo from Warsaw. At the moment, we are determined not to cancel, although we monitor the situation day by day. If we canceled now and lost the invested money, we would certainly not be able to afford another trip to Japan in the near future.According to us, the problem is significantly blown everywhere except in China, where it is a big problem. In the current period, millions of people are infected with ordinary flu and many older people will die from complications just like with coronavirus.We are 30 years old and healthy so I do not think we are in a high-risk group, but of course we take into account the risk. We bought masks and hand sanitizers.What worries us the most is the possible quarantine due to someone being sick, and the fact that many attractions will decide to close, as the ghibli studio has already done.If I were older or sick I would probably not risk it. I wish everyone health and positive conclusion to this troublesome situation so that you don't have to change your holiday plans."
Gllon... not sure if you should cancel but people here are mostly going about their lives as usual. I’m meeting more and more people who don’t really care about it anymore because they’re young and confident that they won’t die if they get it or they’re older and have faith in the medicine here. Maybe we’re being naive at this point but that’s the approach I’m still seeing here today.
"SmooOz, most people don’t really care if you’re here so that’s nice. You can go about your day and they’re not bothered by you. :)Some people might freeze for a moment and or comment in Japanese to the people they’re with if you walk into a restaurant that’s only full with Japanese people. I saw that last night in Kyōto a couple of times. “Uh oh... foreigners...” but not unwelcoming. Most tourists aren’t going to experience the rude salarymen in their 50’s and up who are now paranoid whenever anyone coughs and then glare at them or grunt at them or angrily stomp off to get away from them. And the full on unwelcoming people have advanced from the “no Chinese” signs on their businesses to “Japanese only” which most likely means that they’re using corona as an excuse to do something they’ve been wanting to do before there was a virus spreading around the world."
A Tokyo ramen shop is now “Japanese only” allegedly due to corona virus because apparently no Japanese customers could possibly be carrying the virus and only the foreign devils are poisonous. Foreigners who were born here or have permanent residency or even citizenship can’t eat here too?! Hmmm... it’s corona ?! https:/…
"I'll be participating peak hour shift commute program to avoid rush hour this week. I don't know how it works and how long it lasts. One of our partner company did one day work-from-home trial last week, and over 60,000 employees took part in it. Last week Fukuoka City Subway started call for wearing a face mask, using or handkerchief, etc. on the platform track and in the train."
"Only old people die? It’s hard to believe that Japan is not studying the lessons in China. Although older people or people with pre-exiting conditions are easier to get sick or die in any kind of virus, Coronavirus seems to have fatal effects in healthy young people too. There are reports that multiple Chinese doctors and nurses died recently. They are in their 20s/30s and have no medical issues before. Everyone is equal under this virus, no matter the age or nationality. I hope Japanese government take this seriously and increase the manufacturing of protective devices (masks, full body protective suits, googles, etc), train doctors and nurses on how to handle possible patients without getting affected themselves, and have enough medical facilities to conduct the test in a short time. Only half the people wearing masks is not really a good control to prevent the virus spread. From what I read on various articles, the regular medical masks is not effective in preventing the person wearing it to catch the virus due to the small particle size. It’s mainly used to to reduce the possible spread of virus from people coughing or sneezing.Our trip is scheduled at the beginning of April. I had hoped Japanese government take strong control measures when the situation in Prince Diamond worsened so that it won’t affect the peak Shakura tourism season and the upcoming Olympics. It looks less likely as days going by and the government/people still think it’s no worse than flu.If the community infection rate goes up, there is a high possibility that US government will raise alert level again and require returning citizens to have 2 week quarantines.BTW, South Korea just raised their health alert level to highest level."
"My local GP practice (and, I suspect, ones all over the country) has sent out a text message saying that if you have flu symptoms and have been to a list of countries that includes Japan, in the previous 2 weeks, don't come to the surgery or go to A & E but ring the medical help line and they will tell you what to do.I was surprised to see Japan on the list.Keith, that level of xenophobia is sad, but there are people like that in all countries. At least so far Japan doesn't seem to be having the equivalent of white power demonstrations or shootings."
"I'm not surprised to hear that Japan is listed. There have been untraceable cases reported, which implies there's human to human transmission in town."
The increase in numbers is worrying me. How on earth did it spread so fast. Just read some news outlets saying some attractions will be closed until mid-March (Sanrio Puroland & Ghibli Museum). Quite a number of events are being cancelled too. What if other theme parks will be shut too in the coming days/weeks?My flight to Japan is in a few days and hoping for the infection to reduce will be highly unlikely. Looks like i might have to cancel the trip.I really hope those in Japan will stay safe and well. My thoughts and prayers are with u guys.
"I have to say that Japanese Government have made mistakes at initial stage, such as not banning any entry of Chinese to Japan, which is also thought by many Japanese. But, the virus have already entered and there is human to human transmission in town. Masks will be sufficient soon with more than 100 million new masks to be made. However, the infection will still spread out, although we don't know it's gradually or rapidly.I think how quickly an effective treatment is established is the most important now. Once the progression to severe pneumonia can be easily prevented and treated, this virus would not be a fear for us. China is now doing clinical trials of at least 3 treatments against the coronavirus now, such as anti-malaria drug, chloroquine, Gilead’s experimental drug, remdesivir, and anti-flue drug, Favipiravir. As an Experimental and Clinical Researcher worked for viruses and viral diseases for more than 25 years, I think Favipiravir is the most promising drug from the following reason, It was a new drug for influenza discovered and made in Japan, as follows.https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/130005881888/However, it works as a chain terminator which inhibits the RNA synthesis of various RNA viruses and indeed it was found later to be effective for VARIOUS VIRAL INFECTION including Ebola virus, etc., as follows.https:/…Recently, Favipiravir demonstrated encouraging effects in a clinical trial involving 70 patientswith new coronavirus COVID-19 infection in China. Chinese Government approved Favipiravir as experimental anti-coronavirus, as follows.https:/…https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGH2XfbcKsghttps:/…The efficacy of Favipiravir (commercial name of the drug in Japan is Avigan) for preventing the development of serious symptoms in mild cases, and the onset of symptoms in asymptomatic cases with coronavirus was also confirmed in Japan. Prime Minister Abe ordered Japanese Government to encourage the wide use of this drug in Japan last Saturday. Here are the latest news of Favipiravir (Avigan) from Japan.https:/….XlKkwS3ANSwhttps://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/02/2…Therefore, for foreigners who are considering to visit Japan, I strongly suggests now to follow further information on the development of these drugs for the coronavirus."
"Hi All.My family planned a 3 week trip across japan starting from March 25th. Unfortunately, the growing concern of the virus has forced us to cancel. As other are saying, I’m not really concerned about the virus itself but the panic it’s causing. The risk of possibly being quarantined is not one we are willing to take.We are extremely disappointed about cancelling, especially because we used a major sum of our savings for hotel reservations. However, almost every hotel has been so accommodating to the point of even allowing us full refunds despite our initial non-refundable bookings. This amazing understanding makes me want to visit Japan even more. I hope the situation gets better as we are looking forward to a visit next year."
Enough
"Just canceled my Mid-March trip, as my companions are in college and it would be a mess (and pricey) if we got stuck there. I don't know if we're overreacting. The media treats this very differently these days, no number counts leading the news. I'm a bit confused that there's such a strong govt response in some countries and no clear response in others"
"My husband and I are planning on going to Kyoto on February 28 through March 9. We are trying to decide whether to go or not. Using Wikipedia's numbers for coronavirus cases in Japan, I decided to attempt to estimate how many corona virus cases will be in Japan by the time we leave. Here are the weekly numbers. The first number represents the number of cases at the beginning of the week, and the second number is the number at the end of the week.https:/…2020_coronavirus_outbreak_in_Japan16 Jan - 24 Jan: 1 - 224 Jan - 31 Jan: 2 - 1731 Jan - 8 Feb: 17 - 268 Feb - 15 Feb: 26 - 5315 Feb - 22 Feb: 53 - 135In the last week, the number of cases in Japan increased 2.5 times. I then used this number to extrapolate out the number of cases that might be reported by the time we leave Japan.22 Feb - 29 Feb: 135 - 33829 Feb - 7 Mar: 338 - 8457 Mar - 14 Mar: 845 - 2113By March 9, estimating roughly 1,207 cases.The Wikipedia page also has number of cases in Japan by Prefecture. There are only two cases in Kyoto reported as of now. I think our risk level is relatively low if we do go since our trip is relatively short and in a city with only two cases as of now, though that could change rapidly. I think if we were going any later, we would cancel based on the rise in cases that might happen. I'm trying to think of this logically. My biggest concern is not being able to get out of Japan once we get there. South Korea has almost 6 times the number of cases as Japan right now, and travel in and out of South Korea is not limited yet. There are no easy answers."
""" I don't know if we're overreacting."" - probably not. At this point its a highly individualized decision and for college students who could be really screwed if they got caught up in a quarantine I can understand the costs outweighing the benefits. There is really no right or wrong answer here and you have to go with what feels right to you. Don't second guess yourself. I fear that there is still a lot about this virus that is not really understood and it will be a few months until we really have an understanding of how this is going to play out."
"""I'm trying to think of this logically. My biggest concern is not being able to get out of Japan once we get there. South Korea has almost 6 times the number of cases as Japan right now, and travel in and out of South Korea is not limited yet. There are no easy answers."" Looking at the numbers and trying to make projections is not going to tell you anything. The top experts don't know how this will play out so you certainly have no chance of calculating the numbers. Those types of statistical estimations usually don't take into account steps taken by the government and public at large to limit the spread. Looking at south korea isn't really going to help either. A lot of the south korean cases (at least last time I checked) revolve around a cult and the vast majority of their cases are isolated in a specific area which would explain why there is no warning to not travel to south korea at this time vs a place like mainland china where the virus is all over the country. Probably the one thing you can look at is the number of locally transmitted cases in Japan. If you see the number of locally transmitted cases skyrocketing all around Japan then there is a problem. If the spread is limited to a region you are not in, or if the new cases are people who were put into isolation as soon as they got to Japan and they did not get the virus in japan then I would think that would give you a bit more peace of mind. The numbers alone don't tell the fully story."
"To those who are asking whether to cancel a trip in the next few weeks, my answer - if you are fit and healthy, not with kids or over 60 - is to simply go with your gut instinct. There’s no use projecting infection numbers that simply don’t exist yet. Things could change markedly in one day or one month one way or another.The main question you have to ask yourself is will this situation dominate/overshadow your trip to the point it’s, well, not a holiday!Of course there’s also potential for financial loss if you do cancel, but peace of mind and health of you and your family is the ultimate importance.I sadly had to cancel my holiday to Japan just a day before travelling on Feb 18, I cancelled as I had a cold/sinus infection and feared the outcome once i arrived in Tokyo plus the poor souls near me on the flight freaking out!If it was me now going in the next month I’d probably cancel anyway, despite a financial hit on flights.Hoping by November this is done with and I can rebook and enjoy the autumn colours! Stay safe.Edited: 5:41 pm, February 23, 2020 "
"""The numbers alone don't tell the fully story."" red259, I fully realize this, but we need to base our decision on something rather than fear alone, or alternatively that because locals on the ground are not worried today, doesn't mean that the situation won't change while we are there. I don't think I'm too far off base estimating that the number of cases more than double in a week, based on one expert's opinion I read in the last couple of days, unless cases are just not being reported. I think one thing that is for certain is that the number of coronavirus cases in Japan is going to go up and will continue to go up probably until the summer, when people's immunity improves."
"https:/…newpage_00032.htmlThis is the official MHLW's web site on corona virus problems. It's not real time updated, but better than nothing."
"Even if the number goes up past 1,000, the risk is still low considering Japanese population is 126+ million. I'd worry more about being quarantined when I go back to the US if the number jumps while I'm in Japan. The US implementing something like quarantine in a military base for 14+ days is a real possibility."
"Regarding the numbers... this is my own personal opinion but I feel the numbers in Japan are under reported. ie.. school teacher went to work with a high fever for 7 days before they finally tested her and found out she's positive. https:/…013000cInteresting article about 20 year old woman who infected five family members, tested positive, never showed symptoms: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-hea…"
""" I fully realize this, but we need to base our decision on something rather than fear alone, or alternatively that because locals on the ground are not worried today, doesn't mean that the situation won't change while we are there."" - nobody is suggesting you base your decisions on fear. I am merely pointing out that trying to project the number of cases is not really going to tell you anything and that you are better off looking at the number of confirmed cases that are locally transmitted and where those are located."
"""Regarding the numbers... this is my own personal opinion but I feel the numbers in Japan are under reported' - this is true everywhere. The reported numbers are always going to be the minimum number of cases, especially when some people are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms. Some people will have it and not even realize."
"Leagle... we get those demonstrations here too. Giant black trucks with black tinted windows covered with signs all over them and speakers on their roofs used ride around Sannomiya in Kōbe quite often shouting out their message. It’s here all the time and the corona virus is unfortunately an excuse for seemingly “normal” people to now outwardly discriminate. After all, the building where I’m living was the 4th choice over 4 years ago because my top choices were “Japanese only” residences. No signs posted outside long before corona."
"Maybe they'll send us to Tijuana, lol."

"We have been closely watching this since January as we were scheduled to leave for Japan in mid March. We are healthy senior citizens and felt we could handle the necessary precautions .We had changed our itinerary and canceled the Yokohama part . Yesterday we began to seriously think about canceling when the CDC and WHO upped the risk level to 2. We still thought we could manage it but the deal breaker was learning that our travel insurance would probably not cover any medical issues if we contacted the virus. Look closely at your policy if you are depending on it for medical care outside the US. Medicare does not cover you and our secondary insurance only covers a portion which is why we always buy good travel insurance. If you are in a situation that is considered an”epidemic” or even “pandemic” there are clauses in many policies that exclude coverage. We are not newcomers to Japan, this would have been our fourth trip but hopefully the Cherry Blossoms will be just as beautiful next year"
"Hi Djw34285,I also think it's better not to come this year, if you are seniors and if travel insurance will not cover the coronavirus. It's better to come after an efficient new therapy is established against this virus. A preexistent drug for other viruses, which may also be effective against this virus, will be the fastest to come out, such as Favipiravir (Avigan in Japan)."
"DJW, this is what I’ve been trying to figure out. My son’s school has insurance for all the students going but I don’t have the details. I can’t even figure out what, if anything, our insurance says about such a situation. It’s very frustrating."
I would suggest obtaining a copy of your son’s school policy. Sometimes they are very limited.I would also contact your own insurance company and ask them. Sometimes you can find out the information you need from their website. Good luck and if you do go I hope you have a great trip
"Thank you, I agree. We have a deep affection for Japan and will try and return next year."
"Just a small comment on Narita logistics having come through the airport last night. The sign saying ""expect queues"" at the potential quarantine check-point was non-existent with everyone simply walking through. I was processed by immigration in less than two minutes - pretty much business as usual. My friends on Japanese passports took longer to process through the e-gates due to the queue there."
"I was supposed to travel in the first week of March and I've now decided to cancel my holiday.Luckily I had not bought the JR pass. I'll lose the non-refundable hotel bookings.There is a sharp increase in the number of infections in South Korea which means this whole situation is just unpredictable.I feel so disappointed as I had planned this trip for several months, but whats the point of travelling in fear and not knowing what travel restrictions the country will impose while you're there.Those of you who are still planning to go, good luck and I hope everyone stays safe and healthy and enjoys beautiful japan."
"Traveling in late May. Bought our plane tickets last year and hotels months ago. Considering the amount of money, time, and effort I've already put in, and how much we all want to go, the current plan is to go and hope for the best. Hoping the panic will be over with by then, as people only seem to be able to maintain a state of panic for so long. All the same, I'm not buying anything else for the trip until I have to."
"Like everyone else , we are not canceling . We are coming beginning of June . We will grab the masks and take appropriate health measures . If our government says not to go then of course we will listen , and just hope that Hawaii has no virus !"
Kathleen Pender wrote an article in the San Francisco Chronicle about the limitations of travel insurance. The link is https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/networt… but I can't tell if the link is limited to subscribers.
Six days until our trip and I’m watching the FCO website like a hawk lol. Interesting that the UK updated its wording yesterday to mirror similar advice as USA equivalents (I.e. higher risk for older people/those with pre-existing conditions) but no official recommendation for even those people to avoid travel.
"I met some British last week. They were taking it easy. They cough sometimes because of the temperature difference, but it would be better to wear masks, especially if you cough once in a while."
"going by this link :https:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6I feel that Japan is definitely not among the worst hit or mismanaged. Italy was nowhere last week and now it is next to south Korea! was it that Italy was not expecting this to happen or it happened so unexpectedly even after taking measures? i think extrapolating patient numbers like sales figures is a joke and if the math is that simple then, we all can very well predict the end of Japan and the world!"
Is there any official reliable source to find out how the population whether Japanese nationals or foreign visitors are recovering or being treated for Coronavirus. Are hospitals large enough to cope with this outbreak?
"We are booked to travel in early April but likely will cancel and lose money spent on the holiday. Sadly, unless FCO states non essential travel restriction, our package holiday will not refund which is sadly a bad situation for us and many package holiday travellers. Looking at the rate of infection and that medical experts are still discovering the ever changing incubation periods and ramifications its not a risk we are willing to take. We hope to rebook for some future years but given the costs involved it may not happen. We hope others still travelling will be safe. Still watching the FCO but not very hopeful."
"what creates a doubt in me is why did countries like India, Indonesia and Philippines have really low number of cases? India doesn't has many Chinese visitors but the other 2 have so many of them. considering Dec, Jan and Feb were peak seasons, it is so strange to see that no case was reported other than the 3. is it that these countries dont have the means and facilities to do the testing? or is it just that people in the tropical countries have more immunity?"
"Maybe they cannot practice PCR tests that much, so they might be just filed as pneumonia.#４７４　　The update is a little slow, but below is the official site in Japan:https:/…newpage_00032.html"
"I am from Vietnam and I could say our country is doing quite well during this outbreak though we do not possess the cutting edge medical devices. There are 3 main reasons:1. The government is very attentive to this outbreak with mass cautions on social media and prompt action to infected cases. 2. Citizens follow government's instruction strictly. 3. The weather is getting warmer.In South Korea, it seems that the government do not prepare well in advance and Koreans seems to be not mindful of Corona. I hope the situation will get better next month, because all of us do not want to cancel our trip."
"South Korea is seeing an outbreak at certain massive religion facilities and a hospital nearby.Japan is seeing more cases after they expanded the PCR tests to wider range.The news are telling some corona-virus patients were negative on flu so diagnosised as a cold.Tokyo Government cancelled many events to avoid people gatherings to prevent cluster cases to happen.Edited: 6:20 am, February 24, 2020 "
"Is there a telephone number from any Japanese government agencies for non-Japanese speaking tourists to seek medical help?I have seen discussions about whether travel insurance would cover medical care in Japan if one contracted the virus, but not much discussions about how one can seek help if one does not speak Japanese.Perhaps more seasoned travelers to Japan can provide some advice on this topic. When I visited Japan, I saw there are many pharmacies and drug stores everywhere. The issue is how do you ask them questions if you don't speak Japanese and they don't speak your language. They may have the medicine you seek, but under a different brand name. I saw one of the radio stations in Hong Kong said they interviewed one of Hong Kong passengers from the Diamond Princess who was being cared for in a hospital close to Nagoya. She said she was not unable to communicate with any of the care providers in that hospital due to the language barrier. That caught my attention to this potential issue."
"There is a hotline, but don't use it unless you really need to.https://www.japan.travel/en/plan/hotline/There are also medical interpreters even they won't full time there.One of my acquaintances had to be hospitalized at the Kyoto City Hospital last year.It is the hospital that the two Chinese who had corona-virus were cured.https://news.yahoo.co.jp/pickup/6352141I thought doctors could speak English, but I heard they used automatic translation device to communicate.I talked with the doctor on the phone to help my English-speaking acquiantance and the only thing the doctor asked was about the insurance. I knew the condition wasn't critical by that.If the patient wasn't in insurance maybe he had to ask them to leave the hospital even the patient had pneumonia. I also heard that after the sick got over it, the insurance company paid for the taxi to KIX. So insurance really matters."
Japan National Tourist Office have created a web-page which is aimed at foreign visitors and gives some good information.https:/…mi_guide.html
"Me too, I fly on Saturday! I may cancel yet, but at present my plan is to avoid big cities and just go and chill out somewhere in the countryside and hope I don't get quarantined when I get back to Spain! All accommodation is refundable, I would lose the flight and rail pass cost."
"Hi,I am due to travel to Japan in 3weeks, for a 12days trip. I know the situation got worse lately but at the same time number are still very low.https:/…Still no advice of no travelling to Japan from UK Gov.Also, it is difficult from the news to understand where exactly are the new cases located, which region/ city. Anyone has better information?I am not planning to cancel yet, but of course I will keep monitoring the situation."
"Here is one new case report: https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/02/…The man, a staff member of a senior care facility, visited a healthcare institution on Feb. 12 after he developed ""cold-like symptoms"", but returned home the same day because he was not diagnosed with pneumonia. He returned to work at the senior home on Feb. 13. He spent Feb. 14 at home and then reportedly traveled to Indonesia on a family vacation on Feb. 15. The man was hospitalized upon his return to Japan on Feb. 19 for severe difficulty breathing, and is said to be in ""serious condition"".How effective it will be when the government guideline recommend people to seek medical help only after 4 days of fever (Symptoms of a cold or fever of 37.5 ° C or more have continued for 4 days or more.)? For people working in school, hospital, senior care center, hotel or restaurant, it can spread to multiple people within the 4 day period. It might be better to act on the cautious side and advise people with symptoms to stay at home or seek medical evaluation first (test for the virus) before going back to normal work/travel plan."
"New cases have been added at least a couple of times in a day for various regions for the last few days. They have been already untraceable.At this time of posting, no case has been reported in Shikoku and Chugoku, along with remote islands, such as Ogasawara-mura, Oki, Tsushima, Goto, Amami, etc. I can't predict how long it will last or it can last till the end."
I rang my travel insurance today and they were vague as to whether we are covered. I have no idea medical costs in Japan but have made sure we have 10k spare for any emergency.
"I called my travel insurance today to filed a claim. We are cancelling our trip, we have three children, two of them have had the flu for two weeks and I have also been sick. I explained that there is no way I am traveling and exposing my children. They explained that coronavirus was not a reason to cancel and it case we do travel and get sick, it also won't cover us. I don't get it. I have to submit a doctor's note recommending that we do not travel in order for us to get our money back."
"@saritafercho #483: I am in the same situation, but flying on March 12. What sities / towns will you be staying at? It’s my first visit to Japan , and I don’t know much about smaller non-touristy places."
"I had thought of going to Nikko, which is very touristy, but I think the numbers are right down at the moment. It is looking unlikely I will go, don't want to risk my family and being in quarantine, and the idea was to relax and enjoy my trip, not be stressed about masks, not touching things, avoiding crowds, etc. Perhaps best for me to wait till a better time for my first trip."
"I'm slated to travel to Tokyo late April to early May. My plan now is to not cancel yet but keep monitoring situation every few wks and make a decision close to departure date. I'm not sure of my trip coverage (through Chase with a travel card) but will need to do what's comfortable to my tolerance level.That being said, I'm trying to think about this rationally, while being cautious. I ask myself questions like what are the chances of me catching this virus? What are the chances of me catching if I am vigilant and exercise precautions like handwashing, sanitizer, etc? What are the chances I'll be quarantined upon arrival, given where I'm flying from (Atlanta in my case), and will I be quarantined on the return (USA)? Where are the numbers going in Japan, where are the current cases located? What is the balance between actual risk and cost (ie I'd lose quite a bit if trip cannot be covered under insurance). To this end I've decided to step back a bit from daily or frequently following the news on COVID, instead will check in with US travel advisory and trusted sites and people every few weeks to ensure I'm thinking properly about it given the financial and other stakes, and trying to avoid potential hype, fear and frenzy. Hope this helps and makes sense!"
"Thanks Global, Taffrail and hfot2 for the links to the various sources of help. Every visitors to Japan should bookmark those pages, just in case they need medical help. That multilingual coronavirus hotline looks new, and is a good move by Japan. Everyone will benefit in this situation when those not feeling well can get medical attention promptly, rather than just go about everyday business.Gatomotherof2, a $2,500 deductible seems very high. What is the normal deductible for that plan in the U.S.? And then they will reduce their share through co-pay and fee schedules."
"Does anyone have have a good website where to monitor where are the current cases located?Has my trip is in three weeks I might have to make a decision soon, I am considering going but maybe tweaking the trip avoiding any of the most affected areas. I might just spend 1 night in tokyo and then visit countryside between tokyo and osaka / kyoto."
"I get the impression they don't want people to know exactly where cases are... I am supposed to go on Saturday, and had the same idea, hide out in countryside towns a bit. although look at what has happened in Italy, a whole group of people in a small town!"
"Wikipedia is the most detailed I found so far https:/…2020_coronavirus_outbreak_in_Japan but still I would like to know if some specific village/ city have been affected at all, like Hakone or Kuwaguchiko for example... I know Italy is a worrying example but Lombardia is quite an industrial region with a very weak boundary between city and countryside.. I am trying to think positive and go taking precaution."
What insurance is this through?
I have bookings in tokyo and kyoto from same host who says wear face masks and do what you would for the flu and avoid crowds but like you say taking the subway what do you get--crowds. it is so unfortunate this is happening now. Japan is such a wonderful destination and my son's dream trip. i'm hoping i can get american airlines to move airline reservations for 6 months ahead although it is a non-refundable flight. I bought trip insurance in case we got ill before the trip but i never thought this would happen. if you buy insurance best to buy cancellation for any reason.
"Re: #497: Here is a good site posted by Dr. S. in another thread:https:/…55c22ee976bc42338cb454765a6edf6bIt can switch between Japanese and English version. Not sure how accurate/up to date of the information. Based on Japan Times, the confirmed local cases are 159. If you look at the distribution for region, the area with most tourist (Tokyo and Hokkaido) have higher amount of cases. I used to watch NHK news site for update, but it seems to getting slower in reporting the new occurrence. Japan Times seem to still reporting the status, but it requires subscription. It will be helpful if the government can be more transparent in publishing such tracking information."
"Due to fly to Japan in a couple of weeks - visiting Kyoto, Himoshima and Tokyo. Is there anywhere that we can see exactly how many confirmed Coronavirus patients there are in Japan and where they are being treated. It would be reassuring to have detail such as available hospital beds in Tokyo and Kyoto to cope with cases. How do tourists know there will be capacity to care for foreign visitors as well as their own population. In The UK we know where the quarantined people are and we know where infected are being treated. We need this information from Japan please."
"Interesting map, but as one who has never been to Japan it really would be helpful if Japanese Government would produce easy to see map showing cases. Also give info on hospitals, facilities and beds. FCO is not advising against travel but isn’t giving any help at all. Very frustrating and worrying. I believe they are all too concerned on economic situation with Olympic Games in mind rather than health risk."
"OK, seems like Air France will let me change my flights for an extra fee depending on the date chosen. I am wondering whether things will get better so might cut my losses and change flights until as late as possible."
April out of Miami Florida. They won't refund money but will transfer to another trip. i didn't take into account an epidemic/pandemic (which they don't cover if you don't purchase for any reason cancellation). I only took out travel insurance the last 10 years. Before that I didn't.
"Thanks @Xu H very interesting map, and it is also showing that all the new cases in the last 24h are located in Hokkaido."
"https://www.thedailybeast.com/japans-coronav…Maybe a bit off topic and I don't know enough about Japanese politics to say what the biases are, but very interesting article. Not the first I've seen that casts major doubts on Japan's ability to handle major outbreak. I'm still deciding about whether or not to travel mid-March, but this article does not help to inspire confidence.“In the absence of a strong political leadership, the bureaucrats do, or rather don’t do, their things,” says Nakano. “It’s all about risk management at the expense of the larger crisis.”A ministry of health staffer, on condition of anonymity, talked to The Daily Beast about the low morale and confusion within the agency:“Minister Kato is a politician with no special knowledge of infectious diseases and who clearly doesn’t want to take charge. He knows that he’s going to take the fall when things go wrong, but then he can simply resign. We are stuck here. Decisions have been made based on minimizing negative publicity rather than limiting infection. There’s no one really in charge.”Edited: 1:32 pm, February 24, 2020 "
Thank you this is very helpful. I couldn’t find anything like it on Embassy websites. Which site do you go to to get this info? I am due to travel very soon and keen to know situation.
Traveler 500- To whom are you directing your question?
"My apologies if someone's already posted this, but on Feb. 22 I received a U.S. State Dept. Class Two Travel Advisory re: travel to Japan: ""Sustained community spread has been reported in Japan. Sustained community spread means that people in Japan have been infected with the virus, but how or where they became infected is not known, and the spread is ongoing."" This echoes the CDC's latest Level Two Travel Notice.The thing that really caught my eye in the U.S. State Dept's Advisory was this: ""If suspected to have Coronavirus in Japan, you may face travel delays, quarantine, and extremely expensive medical costs."" Not sure if that means that Americans ""suspected"" of having contracted the virus would not be allowed to return home until after quarantine? Hmm...We're seriously considering canceling our April trip, including our daughter's honeymoon. Sad, but we're thinking if a voluntary, not-really-necessary trip ends up in exposure and illness (or maybe worse) well, that's just dumb. I spent a week in a Crete hospital in 2014 getting an emergency pacemaker. While a whole different ball of wax, we have no desire to repeat that experience. (Learned a painful lesson about having trip insurance that time!)As another poster says, a vacation should be fun and relaxing, not full of stress about precautions and ""what if's."" While we'll lose money by canceling, we think we'll hold off on our Japan visit for now. If anyone has any tips about cancelling Japan Rail Passes (and hopefully getting a refund) please share!"

>>If anyone has any tips about cancelling Japan Rail Passes <<Where did you buy the passes from? Go to the website and find out about cancelling and refund policy. Most venders charge 10% and refund you the rest. I hope you used a reputable vender.
">>I have seen different terms, I don't know if it depends where you bought the pass.<<Yes, it does. Every vender has its own T&C and refund fee varies."
"I'm on the same page as you regarding cancelling our beloved Japan trip. This will be the 3rd time cancelling, all for different reasons. As I have a compromised immune system and I'm over 60 years old, I am very reluctant to travel to Japan in April. I think this will have to wait for another time. We'll lose $$ again, as we will need to cancel return flights from Canada and about 1/2 the hotels are non-refundable (8 nights). But my health is most important to me, and it's too risky. We were just preparing to buy our JR passes when the coronavirus news started in the media."
"Thanks, all! We purchased our passes from JTB USA, which calls itself ""The Largest Authorized Travel Company for Japan Rail Pass."" They have links on their site to the JapanRailPass.net website (implying an agency relationship of some sort.) JapanRailPass.net states this refund policy: ""The application for a refund must be made before the starting date of the validity period, in principle. You will be refunded the value of the PASS in yen, less a 10% handling fee.""Fingers crossed that JTB USA follows this same policy. I'll let you know!"
"They seemed to shut down the site for John Hopkins where you could see the break down of cases, does anybody know of a similar site to get the recent situation in Japan?"
found this on reddit/r/JapanTravelhttps://covid19japan.com/best breakdown ive seen per area..
"""They seemed to shut down the site for John Hopkins where you could see the break down of cases"" - just checked and that website is still working."
"Your right, it is working now... I've been trying since about noon est and it's been asking for a login."
"wow, that is really a great breakdown regarding the areas that are effected, thank you!"
"""Your right, it is working now... I've been trying since about noon est and it's been asking for a login."" maybe they were doing some website maintenance or something."
"Thanks for all the information! Our trip is end of March and so far we haven't thought about canceling, but we have our concerns, mostly about the atmosphere being not enjoyable (panic, fear, etc...). This might sound selfish, but our flight is pretty full and our seats are further back so I've been checking it every day to see if there's any cancellation to move up our seats but doesn't seem like it so far."
"We are supposed to be traveling to Japan March 29-April 9, going to Tokyo Osaka and Kyoto. Though my two friends don't seem to be phased, I am definitely concerned. We're all in good health but I'm more concerned about the potential for quarantine etc. I've been following this thread and it seems like most people are in a similar boat without knowing what to do. I doubt we will have our flights covered, or our rail passes. I think we can get $ back from our hotels. Really don't know what to do at this point"

"https://www.jrailpass.com/refund-policy I am about to go through the same process, so sad..."
"My husband and I are intrepid travelers, and I never thought we would cancel our trip to Japan. We were scheduled to go on March 12. This weekend I woke up in a panic. I am less concerned about getting ill (although of course that concerns me). I am more concerned about winding up being quarantined for a month, far away from home, which, for a self-employed person, would be disastrous. Plus, we were planning on taking the train everywhere, which no longer seems safe, much less the relaxing trip we envisioned. We cancelled our trip. United is refunding us our tickets, minus a hefty cancellation fee ($300 for each ticket). We could not get reimbursement from ANA for our interior flight. All hotels cancelled with no problem. Most surprisingly, we were promised a refund for our Japan rail-passes. All told, the financial damage is high, but not as bad as we feared. Perhaps we would have been fine in Japan, but it just wasn't worth the anxiety and the risk. This is our dream vacation. We will go another year, when it will feel actually dreamy."
"There are many distributors of JR Passes and they all seem to have differing refund policies. Be sure to check with whichever distributor you purchased your passes from.I'm not positive, but I think this is the ""official"" JR Pass website: https:/…rules According to that page, JR Pass vouchers that have not yet been exchanged will receive a full refund minus a 10 percent handling fee. Again, not positive, so I defer to the Japan experts on this one.Oddly, JTB USA, whom I bought my passes from, is only willing to give me an 80 percent refund on two passes, and only a 50 percent refund on three passes bought as part of a Ghibli Museum package. That means they're keeping over $1,000 USD, ouch! I understand JTB is an authorized distributor so I'm not sure how they're getting away with this hiway robbery."
"Sisa, hopefully the trains in Japan are still safe. But you never know.There are definitely some incidents going on more than ever on trains with the tension and paranoia from some people coming to a head. A salaryman started screaming at a student this morning because the kid was coughing. It was over the top and ridiculously unnecessary. Also, another picture of a “Japanese Only” sign from a business in Tokyo is going around Japanese Twitter so those things keep happening here and there too. I don’t understand why it’s “Japanese Only” at the places that are doing this.Edited: 6:57 pm, February 24, 2020 "
"My trip is March 12, flying United. I booked non-refundable hotels so I will lose quite a bit of money if I cancel. I'll wait til next week to decide."
"Staying in Narita airport for 8 hrs layover and even inside the plane can feel anxiety, but hope I'll be just fine."
"I am due to fly to Japan on March 4th and am keeping my plans unless something crazy happens in the next week. I have a US friend who has been living in Japan for the last 2 years and she is living her life as usual, taking public transpo and whatnot. My cousin is also there on vacation and says things have been so far so good. He was scared prior to going due to the media but says things are fine once he got there. To note, both are healthy and in their early/mid 30s."
"I called american airlines today to see what they would say about my non-refundable flight to Japan on April 13th... I've booked my entire flight on AA,com, but from LAX to KIX is JAL. She told me on their list so far was only Hong Kong, Beijing & Shanghai, she advised me to not cancel (even if I know I'm going to cancel) until the latest possible time cancellations are allowed. Her reasoning was because as the cases continue to expand, I may be able to get some sort of refund or exchange then, that is not available to me now. I know this has been discussed, but I also called insuremytrip.com, which is who I bought trip insurance through (underwritten by nationwide). I asked, if I go to Japan, would I be covered for any covid-19 medical expenses... she said she could not confirm or deny and had to reach out to someone for that answer. I bought the policy before Jan 30th. I did review the policy (every word), I don't see anywhere that it states pandemics (or anything of the sort such as 'unforeseen events') are excluded."
"@Karen: I would definitely advise you to wait because if it becomes more serious in Japan, you would most likely be able to exchange it to a different date (not positive about refund, but American Airlines is fairly reasonable with exchanges). I also don't understand people who cancel their non-refundable tickets/accommodations too early? If it's already non-refundable, why don't you just wait it out and see?"
"FYI-""Tokyo Free Walking Tour will suspend all of its tours until March 29, in light of the situation surrounding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).""From their websiteEdited: 10:48 pm, February 24, 2020 "
Hi Karen. I'm with Khan. I would wait to see if AA cancels then you should get refund.Got to love insurance companies. I rang ours yesterday to find out if covered for Corona and had to go to hospital. Totally vague and have no idea if covered.
"@KarenD - it's like typhoons. If the airline cancels/reschedules, they pay. If you cancel/re-route you pay. I had a case a while back where we were flying Sapporo to Hiroshima and the cost would have been around $500/person to re-book if we did it, but zero if JAL cancelled our flight and re-booked us. As it turned out, the typhoon passed by early and the flight was not disrupted (caused some mayhem elsewhere).The essential difference is one of choice. if you choose or change your mind, you are not covered by things like consumer protection laws or travel insurance. If your supplier of service cancels/changes, then you have some better protections."
We (family of 3 with 10 year old daughter) are scheduled to fly to Tokyo from Dubai with Cathay Pacific on 22nd March. Checked with the airline and understand around USD 500 will be charged for cancellation but still I get back around 80% of the ticket price. Airbnb refund will be 50%. Just monitoring the situation like most here and probably will make a call by mid March.
Hey Tonytt7 did you go ahead with your trip? What was your experience like?
"Have you gone ? I am supposed to leave in a couple of weeks, now I am keeping a close eye on this situation"
"I personally cannot recommend you to come to Japan, since many experts in infectious diseases in Japan now say that we are in ""the Early Stage of Intra-city Spreading of the Virus, and we cannot prevent its spreading"".The development of an effective therapy is the only hope I have now. Although development of effective Vaccines and New Drugs will take much time, if a pre-existing drug for other virus is found to be also effective for the coronavirus, it can probably be used soon. Clinical trials of at least 3 such drugs are going on for the coronavirus in China, such as anti-malaria drug, chloroquine, Gilead’s experimental drug, remdesivir, and anti-flue drug, Favipiravir. As I have worked as a Clinical Researcher for viral diseases and Experimental Researcher using various viruses for more than 20 years, I personally think that Favipiravir is the most promising drug from the following reason. It was a new drug for influenza discovered and developed in Japan, as follows.https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/130005881888/But, it works as a chain terminator which inhibits the synthesis of RNA of VARIOUS VIRUSES and it was indeed found later to be effective for various viral infections including Ebola virus, etc.Recently, Favipiravir demonstrated encouraging effects in a clinical trial involving 70 patients with the coronavirus COVID-19 infection in China. Chinese Government approved Favipiravir as experimental anti-coronavirus, as follows.https:/…https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGH2XfbcKsghttps:/…Clinical trials of this drug for the coronavirus is now going on in Japan and Prime Minister Abe have ordered to increase the production of this drug. If effective results are obtained in these clinical trials soon, I can recommend you to come to Japan, so I hope you to keep your eyes on these information, if you are considering to come to Japan."

"My trip is not until March 28, and up until about a week ago I was pretty sure I was still going. As of now, I am thinking I will have to cancel. I am going to wait until the last possible moment to cancel, but I just have the feeling this is not going to get better.As kobekeith posted, I think we are going to see infections start to rise in Japan especially now that we have confirmation a lot of the cruise ship passengers are testing positive after being allowed off the ship and taking public transport, staying at a hotels, etc, etc.Also, I see some people are still making that argument that the health risk is still relatively low compared to the flu and if you are young and healthy and practice good hygiene you should have no problem. I fall into the young and health still, but I think there are other risks one needs to weigh like the possibility of quarantines, flight disruptions, etc.I just awoke to the news of a hotel in the Grand Canary islands where all the guests are on virtual lockdown and cannot leave the hotel all because 1 guest from Italy tested positive for the virus. So even though you may not personally get sick, imagine having to go through that on a vacation! Imagine being locked down in a capsule hotel haha.Also, as a US citizen you've got to think about the risk of the CDC raising the alert level from 2 to 3. I know if they do that, my insurance policy, and many other policies, will not cover the cost of any medical expense related to the virus.So yea, there are a lot of factors to weigh in unfortunately."
https:/…J League postpones 94 matches scheduled until Mar 15.
"It is more than just an issue of getting ill with the virus. The larger risk as I see it is that you are forced into quarantine in Japan or when you return or if you are able to return. I find the advice from FCO in the UK extremely unhelpful as its all about precaution and nothing about no to nonessential travel. The UK health authority now telling people to self isolate for 14 days if returning from effected regions in Italy following the outbreak, but still no updated advice about not travelling there. It makes no sense. Many travellers sitting on the fence are doing so because costs associated with cancelling holidays. Many people would get refunds if FCO and equivalent bodies came out and said no to non-essential travel. As someone said on a news briefing recently... you can either contain the virus or save the economy but you can't do both. I guess we know where the UK government stands."
"Is anyone booked to travel to Japan with Trailfinders?We are booked to leave mid March and would be interested to hear thoughts on help/support Trailfinders are giving to clients. No info that I can find on their website as to current situation, no contact regarding what ‘their agents in Japan’ are reporting. So far we can see hotels have made changes to restaurant opening times, walking tours have been cancelled and some tourist places closing. Just wondering if other clients feel rather in the dark. We are on a self guided tour and as such will be left to our own devices which would be great under normal circumstances but we are feeling less and less safe at the present time. I fear economics appears priority for UK and Japan Governments rather than recommending only essential travel for a period to try to get this more in control. Anyone feel the same?"

"I have a family trip booked to Japan and it has been frustrating to say the least to see the UK government and others not doing what they are meant to do to ensure citizen's safety. In the end we will take a financial hit on this trip as I wouldn't risk the health but more importantly the potential for being under forced quarantine. The only place the UK government has advised against travel based on the COVID-19 is China, all other places with outbreaks is for the travellers to be aware. Quite a damning statement given they are busy repatriating people. Will they do the same for the poor people stuck in Spain, I wonder. Closing the barn door after the horse has bolted comes to mind."
"@gatormotherof2: with you 100% about living. Life goes on guys but of course everyone has their own situation. So it's really up to yourselves. You cannot ask how others are feeling and gauge if you want to go or not.And btw the tiny lysol sprays are wonderful and after a few trips with friends have gotten them hooked too. I was using wipes for cleaning seat belts, TV remotes, TV screens, tray tables, hotel room wayyyyyyy before Tyra Banks made that go viral. I even bought a seat cover on Amazon and cover my economy seat. Never use the blankets they provide except to put it on the floor of my seat to put my bag and whatnot. My trip to Tokyo is March 25th, still going as of right now. And USD is looking strong against the Euro and Yen. No complains here."

@NJGUT Did you mean to say that your request HAS been denied?
"Air France will let me change my flights if I pay 150 euros plus the difference, I am looking at the end of May but things might be just the same. Do I just not fly and lose 450 euros (my flight was so cheap!) and buy a completely new flight in the future, or pay 150 euros and risk not being able to go again in May? What would you all do?"
"Due to the really bad situation with the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan, I requested exemption from the penalty imposed for changing trip dates to 2021. Even though (at date of the is post) there is a U.S. CDC Level 2 Alert warning advising older individuals to consider avoiding non-essential travel, my request has been denied on multiple occasions. Tours for Japan are still being sold as of this date.I would advise those individuals thinking about Globus as an tour operator to consider their customer service practices and attitude toward customer safety before booking with them."
Yes. Denied. I re-posted. Thanks.
"Especially as the Ghibli museum has been closed until late March, so presumably the whole of those tickets should be refunded."
"I'm not canceling anything. Me and the wife are a little nervous but our excitement speaks louder. We get there on the 14th of March. We are young, healthy and bought a box of masks and got plenty of hand sanitizers and wipes. I believe that as long as we follow proper hygiene procedure and don't touch our faces, we will have the time of our lives. The touristy spots look like it will be less crowded, which makes it that much better. This is a flu after all, just one without treatment. So as long as we use common sense, i think we will be ok."
"I am flying 3/2 with Delta to Narita. Since the CDC alert is only level 2, I am subject to cancellation fees. However, I am not worried! Be safe, stay warm, practice good hygiene and use common sense above all! Looking forward to my second trip to Tokyo and Kyoto- it is a spectacular country!"
"554. That sucks but to be fair all tour package operators are pretty much the same, they buy in bulk and have to pay the hotels, airlines etc regardless if they fill the seats as such. They mark it up and hope to make money doing so. None of them really care about customer safety or anything except making money. Right now they are all crapping as people are either cancelling / not buying or making changes. Insurance coverage is going to take a major hit as people find out policies they were pressured to purchase in reality are of little value except under very specific circumstances. Only if you paid dearly for the cancel for any reason coverage do you stand a chance unless your government puts actual travel restrictions i place. In our case the package was sold by Air Canada Vacations and uses their own aircraft and they refuse to do anything for us, we have all travel coverage except cancel for any reason and they are not even answering enquiries anymore from us. Never again for a vacation package, separate airfare (change for a small charge) hotel (they offer free cancelation up to 48 hrs prior) , o real savings by going the vacation package route just a little simpler. Disgusting how these companies are taking advantage to try and limit their losses in the short term. I checked with the hotel directly and they are indeed waving any sort of cancellation charges that they have with tour companies , so Air Canada Vacations in my case are simply looking to pocket my payment and have no cost to them."
That's the spirit!
"A little more information for those of us who are going, and those of us who are not...https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/02/6…"
"My family of 3 will be traveling to Japan mid April. We have no plans to cancel our trip at this time (my 12 year old has been excited about this trip). We don’t believe our health is at risk as long as we take precautionary (common sense) measures to not get sick. This can all change within the upcoming days.Right now, What we are more concerned about is being quarantined outside of US or not being able to return to the US. I know we can’t predict what will happen, but I’m interested to hear about people who have returned to the US from their Japan trip within the next couple weeks."
I would change to next year when there’s a vaccine available
The ticket to the Ghibli Museum has already been refunded to everyone (mine included :/)I will keep my trip anyway. I arrive in Tokyo on Monday. The chance of getting a disease is very low.
"Like BeeSeaShell (#562), I am also interested in hearing from people who are returning from Japan to the US over the next couple of weeks. Will be great if anyone can share their experience."
"We leave on the 4th of April from the UK and my worry is not getting the disease but going to a Japan on lock down as the priority will be the Olympics in the summer. We have spent a huge amount of time planning this trip of a life time, not sure if JAL will refund as UK not a route flagged on their website. Are there still new cases in Japan? Looks like there haven't been any in the last few weeks. Our hotel in Takayama has emailed to ask if we are cancelling, suspect they will close if they get lots of cancellations! Would the Takayama festival be cancelled if there are no new cases? If we cant get a refund on the flights we have to go anyway and make the best of it and not see any of the major tourist sights (we wont be back as it has taken years to save). :("
No new cases in the last few days not few weeks
Maybe stop with the conspiracy/political theories? Its a travel forum.
"UK FCO have just updated advice re non essential travel to 11 northern Italian towns with almost 300 Coronavirus infections YET no mention of travel advice regarding Japan despite country having over 860 Coronavirus cases!!!! And Japanese government admitting worry of spread and possible shortage of hospital beds.... so UK FCO advice appears based on economic reasons, Olympics etc, rather than health of its Nationals."
"You should exclude the number of Diamond Princess. The captain is British and operated by an American company. The first stage is really like a cold, so it is advised to stay home, putting priority to save the beds for the critical patients."
I realize that the ship is “separate” but aren’t all of those people carrying the virus in Japanese hospitals in different places? And that’s how a nurse in Saitama got it? I agree that they don’t want to hurt the Olympic Games so they’re trying to salvage that. The health or wellbeing of the people comes last.
"Hi. I am in the same situation. Still on the fence wheter to go or not. If the State Department raises the level to 3, then I will have to cancel my trip with my family in Apirl."
"I'm almost on the same schedule but departing from Canada on ANA. They are offering refund or transfer for no fee for flights departing before April 20th. I'm sure JAL will offer something similar if it gets worse. We are going to continue to monitor and probably make a decision 7-10 days prior (based on cancellation policies at hotels).I am also not really worried about getting infected, but I am worried about a 14 day quarantine. Fingers crossed it peaks very soon."
"Have a 5 day trip planned for Tokyo in early June. Have no plans to cancel it on our own even if the virus starts turning people into zombies because this is a trip of a lifetime. HOWEVER, any guesses on how this pans out over the summer? The Olympics would take place right after I leave there (assuming), so I would also assume that Japan would do everything in their power to make sure this doesn't affect the the games nor it's tourism during this peak time."
"Our family is flying to the Philippines from SFO via ICN on Apr 30 and back in early June. So we're already monitoring how the situation in Korea develops. I know some countries are already placing restrictions/quarantine for even just transiting through Korea (not US of course, yet. But some airlines have already reduced Korea-Philippines flights)But we've also scheduled a ~1 week trip from Manila to Tokyo then Osaka (with Kyoto & Hiroshima) before flying back to Manila in late May/early June). So we hope things can settle by then. Even with decreasing rate of new cases, governments look to be going with a reasonable abundance of caution. I guess we'll wait until April to make any decisions."
"""We are young, healthy and bought a box of masks and got plenty of hand sanitizers and wipes."" ---> not going to help you when they quarantine your hotel because someone in there tested positive. This was in the news from Canary Island, quarantined an entire hotel ( all the people) because one Italian man tested positive. This is crazy, I cant get a refund because it's not at that level yet, however if you go, you risk being quarantined somewhere."
"We're booked to go on 26th March, self-guided tour through Voyage Privé. Called them last week for advice but they were totally vague and unhelpful. They were not willing to offer any change to the trip so all we could do was cancel and lose our money or go, so, at the moment, we're still going!"
"Back in 2018, the CDC raised the travel notice level for Japan to level 2 due to an outbreak of Rubella in Japan and it is still in effect. Just be careful. https:/…rubella-japan"
"# 573I don't remember the case of nurse in Saitama. The nurse in Sagamihara, Kanagawa got it from the first old lady who was diagnosised with corona-virus after she died.Also a nurse who interviewed a town delegate caught it from him. They didn't know he had it.The patients from Diamond Princess are treated at special separate parts of hospitals. I wish their own countries take care of them instead."
"""Wait and see"" is the best advice that can be given at this moment. Things are changing daily. Depending on whether the ""clusters"" of people who have tested positive becomes a bigger cluster will make all the difference. It's said that the next two weeks are pretty crucial. Sports games, concerts and attractions where BIG groups of people gather, ie Sanrio Puroland and Ghibli, have cancelled, postponed or are temporarily closed. At least for a couple of weeks. Sumo is still contemplating as are the baseball leagues. Large companies are telling workers to work from home. Or changing work schedules so their people won't be on the trains during rush hour. The Catholic Archbishop sent out a ""decree"" that said ""NO Masses for the next 2 weeks."" March 1 and 8. (Hong Kong hasn't had Masses for weeks!) Here's a good site that has the latest statistics worldwide. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Shot, I agree with what you said. One does wonder....... In the meantime, enjoy your ski trip! Winter is supposed to ""stop by"" again in a couple of days. Hope you'll have snow! The World Cup in Naeba was dreadful. Beats me why they didn't have it in Nagano. There's ALWAYS better snow there than in Niigata! :-)Edited: 8:23 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"To those who are going forth with their travel plans within this coming weeks, I admire your optimism! Do take care of yourselves!Because I'm such a worrywart, I have cancelled my 2 weeks Japan trip this coming Thursday =(. The thought of being quarantined either in Japan or back home after the trip scares me. Just can't afford the time and money.Hope the infections will subside soon."
"To be fair most of those cases are the cruise ship, there are currently 157 cases ""on the ground"" in Japan and the number is rising only slowly, compared to Italy and Korea which have shot up out of all proportion."
">> The patients from Diamond Princess are treated at special separate parts of hospitals. I wish their own countries take care of them instead.<<Totally agree with you. Japanese government made a huge mistake letting that ill fated cruise ship dock at Yokohama. Now our doctors and nurses face perilous risks daily taking care of many infected foreign patients, and of course they are draining our tax 血税."
"Korea has massive clusters at a new religion church. Now it is spreading the capital Seoul too.In Japan, one sport club in Nagoya and the other in Chiba seems to form clusters.In Tokyo, more companies started to make their employees to work from home to avoid the packed trains of rush hours.Even your home countries might have outbreak once they do PCR tests more.Edited: 8:43 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"# Wait, Dr. Shibuyakko, are you paying taxes to Japan?I wonder US is doing enough PCR tests.If it weren't for that report of the Hong Kong old guy, many of the carriers would have landed without any precautions if it were one or two days later. I wish they take the American patients to the hospitals at the bases in Japan.The Japanese hospitals, even they are carried to many prefectures from Miyagi to Aichi, are not having enough beds that they are talking about taking the infectious patients to the usual areas."
"#579 Hi , we were in the same position as you but now we are here, we are happy we have cancelled. We are also on a self guided tour, using trains, and it’s working out well. The Tokyo metro reminded me of the London Underground in rush hour - impossible you avoid crowds. We suspect that by the time we get home in a couple of weeks we might have to self quarantine but so be it. 2 weeks is a long time as far as Coronavirus is concerned and it seems that Italy is more of a problem now."

Has anyone else been successful cancelling their trips On ANA without being hit with fees?

"Japan doesn't have a enormous number of cases (as today it appears to be 170) but my concern it is that the cases are spread everywhere among the prefectures, which make the travel planning difficult. I am due to travel in 3 weeks, travelling between Tokyo, Hakone, Okayama, Kyoto and Osaka by train, and still monitoring the situation, but I really hope the daily number of cases will drop or it will be start to be worrying."
"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/th…A Thai couple that went on a holiday in Hokkaido apparently got infect there. So for people looking at statistics and inferring low chance of getting infected, yes, the chance is slim but It can happen to you. No wonder there is this concept called optimism bias."
"Written by a Japanese Political Science professor in Tokyo: ""And so the Japanese people have been told not to seek testing, nor bother visiting medical institutions unless their symptoms are severe and lasting. Mr. Abe has, in effect, outsourced the government’s containment efforts to the population itself, while the state concentrates limited resources on the severely ill and makes little effort to increase those resources. He might also have been thinking: With no test, there can be no rise in confirmed cases either."" https:/…"
"Kanagawa Prefecture Governor Kuroiwa said in TV news a few days ago that Diamond Princess passengers arrangement (hospital assign, transportation, etc.) was done by the prefecture office staff. Obviously, he had thought it was all MHLW's business, but eventually it turned to be his office's task. He complained it was lack of leadership in the cabinet.Edited: 7:17 am, February 26, 2020 "
"The spread from the cruise —— such a failure by Japan. Hokkaido has the most now ? https:/…Edited: 7:27 am, February 26, 2020 "
"Sisa, no matter what the PM says, people will do what is ""correct."" There are a LOT of complaints about the ""lack of testing."" No worries. The public is wiser than the government. :-)"
This will help to keep the number of new cases down. Or at least off of the official count. https://www.nippon.com/en/news/yjj2020022500…It’s also too bad so many men don’t wash their hands here or just do a quick splash of water on their fingers and ignore the soap if there is any soap at all.
Im booked for 2 week self guided/train trip for honeymoon in early April. Really don't know what to do. Same as others its the fear of quarrantine either there or when we get home that is the thing thats putting me off. I do have asthma but assume the virus would still only effect me in a mild way.All hotels are refundable but as flights to Tokyo aren't 'banned' I dont think we would get our expensive flights refunded. We had thought we might see about changing to go somewhere else but looks like nowhere is 'safe'. Waiting and checking news daily at the minute but its going to get to the point where we have to go and risk it (tempting - it will certainly be quieter than usual!) or cancel and risk not getting anything else booked up because everyone else has changed plans too. Rubbish!
https://www.ajmc.com/newsroom/cdc-warns-that…It's a matter of when instead of where.
It seems amazing to me after what we are seeing in S. Korea and Italy that Japan is still only seeing 10 or so new cases a day...
"Well Japan and the US needs more PCR tests for the suspicious patients, I guess.It is reported in Japan now that the doctors first thought their patients were just having a cold but after a week they found that they had pneumonia and tested positive on corona-virus. Then the doctors themselves got infectious.Edited: 9:01 am, February 26, 2020 "
@608: you have had contact with not one but THREE people in Japan who tested positive for the coronavirus?????
"I am supposed to leave for Tokyo from the US in 26 days, along with my husband and his best friend. This is my husband's dream trip. As of now we are still planning to go. We will certainly reevaluate if the travel advisory goes above a 2. Our plan is to spend 8 days in Tokyo, 3 days in Kyoto, and 3 days in Hiroshima. Because we've already paid for our Airbnbs and our travel insurance will not cover epidemics, we would be out thousands of dollars if we cancelled. Yes, the trip may be a little different than we had originally planned (really hoping Ghibli Museum opens back up before we get there), but we still think we will have an amazing trip. We are young (low 30s), healthy, and prepared to bring along masks, hand sanitizers, etc. to protect ourselves. I think our biggest worry is not catching the virus, but getting quarantined in Japan or US. I've been reading this thread pretty regularly and I am hoping people who did end up going will come back to the thread and report what their experience was like, both with how the trip went (were things open, how were the trains, were tourist sites less crowded than expected) and their experience at the airport (what was the screening process like upon entering Japan and landing in the US, were they told to self quarantine once they return home)."
"#608 how can you confirm the three cases you had contact with were confirmed to be coved-19 tested? Did they admit that to you or you had access to their medical records.Also, being in close contact with coved-19 person and you not being infected does not mean you are immune to it as there are many environmental factors involved, which could not be closely studied in your circumstances such as were you close enough to them, did they expel (sneeze or cough) enough virus particles onto you, wind direction etc. Are there any confirmed studies proving that onsens are places where higher infection occurs and by what mode of virus transmission through air or water, as you can see many unknown questions that may not be assumed to be factual."
"https:/….Xlae8oZKhTYEdited: 11:58 am, February 26, 2020 "
"Honubaby, yes, true, very sad and very disgusting approach by turning people away from hospitals. Hiding the truths again. It’s very common in Japan."
"There is a nice article in the morning news identifying how some people wanting testing for covid-19 in Japan are being denied tests as they do not meet criteria. The implication is that (1) there are many more cases around than being reported - no surprise, and (2) many cases are mild and do not have the headline value of hospitalizations or death.BTW, on the https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ site previously mentioned there is a nice reminder of some other causes of death for perspective - some preventable, others less so.2,771 Coronavirus deaths this year76,304 Seasonal flu deaths this year2,039,403 Communicable disease deaths this year1,194,111 Deaths of children under 5 this year264,092 Deaths caused by HIV/AIDS this year1,290,235 Deaths caused by cancer this year154,095 Deaths caused by malaria this year785,339 Deaths caused by smoking this year392,917 Deaths caused by alcohol this year168,464 Suicides this year212,066 Road traffic accident fatalities this year"
It’s the shame of the world-https:/…coronavirus-japan-abe.amp.html
"#606 Probably because they are not testing people, only the very sick. Here is the testing criteria from an article someone else posted: ""eligible to take the virus test are people who have come into close contact with coronavirus patients or have recently traveled to infected areas in China, where the virus originated, and have a fever of at least 37.5 degrees Celsius as well as pneumonia-like symptoms that require hospitalization.""from: https://www.nippon.com/en/news/yjj2020022500…Japan is not doing anybody any favors be keeping their real numbers hidden so that proper travel advisories can be in effect... then maybe people wouldn't have to at the cost of canceling their vacation."
"Yes, well, there is only one illness on that list that countries are quarantining ships and hotels over now isn't it."
"Posting concerns due to similar fears I have as likely in June (maybe July), my father and I plan to visit Japan ourselves. We've already canceled plans to make a side trip to South Korea since South Korea has had the second-highest amount of coronavirus infections after China. Would you still recommend visiting Japan in perhaps four to five months?"
"Surely the UK FCO should be ensuring the Japanese government produce accurate figures including the cruise ship passengers that are all now back in their homes or hospitals as a TOTAL inclusive figure. I think we have passed the point of whether people were infected on cruise ship or returnees from China, more important that we know total number infected in Japan so our governments can advise their nationals accordingly of the true risk and caution against travel as they have done in Italy. Too much hiding for fear of risk olympics being cancelled and economics instead of concentrating on health of population. How do we all get this message out in the news? FCO is not helping to keep us safe."
"The truths are hard to get out there. Money is the key and the Olympic Games will make money. Or lose money. If you think the government should care more about the citizens vs. the Olympic Games, look at the tsunami victims from Ishinomaki who were made homeless for so many years as olympic venues were being constructed at record pace. No houses for the people though. After billions of yen in donations for those victims. They couldn’t get housing but the games were on track."
"HiWe are planning to arrive in Tokyo on 22nd March for a stay of 3 weeks in Japan. We will be coming through Bangkok. In Japan we are planning to visit Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka. Our return is on 11th April. Can some of local residents in Japan or visitors share the Corona Virus experience and the checks in Bangkok, Tokyo (Narita) and Osaka airports. Also the quarantine inspections please"
"No one can tell you what is going to happen in 3 or 4 months. It's a wait and see. We go on Saturday. Watched a specialist on news last night and also spoke to my GP. Both said constant washing of hands. Mask. And specialist also advised to wipe tray table on plane. Getting wipes today. Will take all the precautions as advised. Millions are going about their normal day in Japan. It seems Every time we go away something happens. 9/11. Mumbai attacks. Bali bombings. Plane crashes. Im not joking. Every single time. Im a little nervous, but just like being in Mumbai when attacks were happening you go about your day as callous as that sounds."
"Just an update about trips to Japan. I had some friends who were coming on Feb. 29 from the US to go skiing in Hakuba. All was well until yesterday. A company that one friend works for said, ""Anyone who travels to China, Japan or Italy can't come into work for 2 weeks after they return."" (South Korea will probably be on that list soon, too.) Self-quarantine policy. My friend can't afford to take 2 weeks of more ""vacation"" time. Even if they're not working for a company that has those policies (yet), things might change within the next two weeks, and they can't afford to take that chance. So....... they cancelled their trip. IF you are planning to come to Japan and you are still working, be sure to check what your company policies are!"
"I've been confident that I'd still go to Japan (due to depart next week, would stay for 3 weeks).The Covid-19 was not much of a concern, since I tend to have a bit of an apocalyptical vision and think this is going to become a pandemic somehow, and humans can only wait to gain some sort of immune resistance to it over time. My main concern was that Japan would start closing down some places that are on my must visit list. I came across this list, which I'm sure will grow over the next few days/weeks:https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/things-to-do/a…"
All schools in Japan will close now!?!https:/…101000c
"This video is helpful for those trying to decide what to do. It shows the streets of Tokyo (virtually empty), a tourist area (also virtually empty). The man on the video and his wife plan stay home for awhile (stay at home, cook at home). His current advice is to cancel trips if possible.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxK7etjDuKI"
"Hi,I am subscribing to this thread, as my wife and I have a trip to Japan on April 23 - May 3. We are in our early 30s and are a little anxious about the trip due to the coronavirus.We booked non-refundable hotels with Hyatt, Hilton and AmexTravel. So far, Hyatt said they would refund my non refundable rate due to the virus. I haven’t reached out to Hilton or AmexTravel yet.We are kind of in the wait and see period with Japan trying to stop the spread by cancelling schools and events. I wanted to say thank you for all the updates on the situation. We will continue to monitor to see if we will continue with our planned trip or cancel."
"The list above will get longer come March as the Japanese Medical Association has designated March as the month to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infections and recommended cancellations of many events and closure of attractions.p.s. Congratulations, hfot2 on becoming a DE for Tokyo and Hiroshima!!Edited: 1:31 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"Yeah - this is what is worrying me...We're due in Tokyo at the start of April. The virus itself doesn't bother us given how few cases there have been (based on the 38 million people in the greater metropolitan area), and we're happy to wear masks or whatever. However, half the places we wanted to visit are on the closure list, and I now suspect most of the others will do so too.At this stage, all we can do is hope that the initial two week closure works as hoped and everything re-opens for April.Edited: 3:34 pm, February 27, 2020 "
Can someone please repost the Japanese tourist website which had all the health contacts etc on it? I can’t find it anywhere! I’m just getting all my travel docs etc in order for Sunday :)

"@honubaby Thanks for the heads up - perhaps I misread the policy, I will go in and check again although at this point I'm not panicking. My hotels can still be cancelled without penalty. I suspect the situation will change quite a bit over the next 3 weeks so it will be a roller coaster. News of potential school closings certainly isn't a good sign!"
Makes me sad as well. I am sure disney is next. I wonder if they start closing temples also? Every day I am sliding so much farther towards cancelling my Late march trip of a lifetime to Japan.
"Today’s news of schools closing across Japan was the game changer causing me to cancel our trip in March 2. Luckily all 3 tickets were bought with points. Delta was kind enough to waive the $150 per person redeposit fee. All taxes and fees paid will be reimbursed .No cancellations fees- thank you Delta! I did havea nonrefundable booking.com lodging reservation for Tokyo that I am stuck with. I was able to cancel Kyoto lodging for a full refund.Sure hope that the Japanese citizens stay healthy and safe. I am glad children will he kept home.Edited: 9:10 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"Unfortunately, schools are not actually “closed” across Japan. The students can stay home from most schools but the teachers are disposable.But I do think that the March people cancelling is a good idea at this point. If we see panic shopping next for food, it’ll be selfish of people to just show up here in the next 2 weeks all thrilled about less crowds and then getting food from hotels.Edited: 9:34 pm, February 27, 2020 "
Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea will be closed from Feb. 29 to March 15.
I know how you're feeling. A friend just laid that one on us too.. Got us second guessing. Stand to loose mega bucks if we cancel.. Unless our govt cancels travel which won't happen. So we're going to Wing it and hoping things change in three weeks.
Yes!!a positive attitude goes such a long way.
kobekeith: that’s a good point about available food and supplies for residents vs tourists. There is already some concern about panic shopping here in California (at least among my community) so I get it. Will definitely keep that in mind as I watch the situation and make the decision to still go or postpone.
"Coronavirus - why we shouldn't panic!--------------------------------------------------Malta saw scenes of panic, right out of World War Z yesterday as people raided supermarkets in search of the final roll of toilet paper, and the last packet of Galletti.But I would like to take your time on this fine Thursday to bring to your attention, exactly what this virus represents in Numbers! After All, Numbers don’t lie.So, here it goes:80,000 People are Sick with Coronavirus at the Momentof which 77,000 are in China.This means that if you are not from China than this should remove 96% of your worry.If you contract Coronavirus, this still is not a cause for alarm, because:81% of the Cases are MILD14% of the Cases are MODERATEand only 5% of the Cases are CRITICALThis means that if you do get the virus, you are most likely to recover from it.Some say, “imma this is worse than SARS! The world is ending!” – THIS.IS.A.LIE.SARS had a fatality rate of 10% while COVID-19 has a fatality rate of 2%!Moreover, looking at the ages of those who are dying of this virus, the death rate for the people UNDER 50 years of age is only 0.2%!This means that the majority of people actually recover!This means that if you are under 50 years of age, and not living in China, you are more likely to win the lottery which is a 1 in 45,000,000 chance!NOW, Let’s take one of the worst days so far – the 10th of February. Whilst we were enjoying our Public Holiday, 108 persons in CHINA died of Coronavirus.BUT, on the same day26,283 people died of Cancer24,641 people died of Heart Disease4,300 people died of Diabetesand on that day, Suicide, unfortunately, took more lives than the virus did, by 28 times.Moreover, Mosquitoes kill 2,740 people every day, HUMANS kill 1,300 fellow humans every day and Snakes kill 137 people every day.One final thing which we would like to address is the Myth of the Mask. No, this is not the latest Indiana Jones instalment but a huge misconception.Basically, people who are not sick do not need to wear any mask. A mask is worn to contain germs, in case, those who are affected sneeze (which is the most common way of spreading the virus). The mask should be worn by those who feel that they might be sick. The mask carries germs on its outer part, and, if not changed frequently, then it might actually be one of the carrying vehicles of the germs!"
"Hi,Have been going through the thread and as usual anxious.We are a group of 15 and travel on 22nd March, still some time left. We are planning to hold on as we have our cancellation window for our hotels till 19th. Should we hold back or cancel ? We have one person who is above 60 but fit.Thanks"
"Phoofy, with everything changing so suddenly in the last day, hopefully people coming soon will wait and see if things get worse. I was here during SARS and it’s different this time. Toilet paper is now gone. But tourists will have it in their hotel rooms I guess so that’s great for them. This article shows some differences too:https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/arti…Edited: 1:39 am, February 28, 2020 "
"@kobekeith: toilet paper? Why? I wouldn’t imagine it running out, especially in Japan...."
Lol... be sure to pack your toilet paper.
"I can confirm a shortage of face masks at pharmacies here in Tokyo, based on my experience today.Didn't think to check on toilet paper (but we've kept an emergency supply since the March 15 earthquake :-)Here's a cross-post from another current thread here on TAI live in Tokyo, and am here now. The way I'm summing it up for friends and family back home is to make some anecdotal observations:The number of tourists in Tokyo is downThe use of face masks is up (but this is already flu and allergy season)The drugstores I checked were sold out of face masksWord is, the face masks will stop the transmission of the virus, but it will not protect you from the virusThe best hygiene protocol is to wash your hands with soap and waterSecond best is rubbing alcohol as hand washThird is alcohol based hand sanitizerFourth is alcohol-based handi-wipesI can confirm that at lest some international schools have closed until after Spring Break, at. the end of MarchReliable numbers of cases in Japan are hard to come by, but in general are considered by most people I've talked to as suspiciously lowHokkaido has the most number of cases by prefectureI don't know how reliable this website is, but this website has numbers to attach to country names https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ (Japan is currently sixth, NOT including the cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.Japan-Guide, which is considered a reliable source by most long-time contributors here at TA and on other discussion boards, has a list of closures. not sure how often it's updated, but it's dated February 28th.I'm compiling a post which lists some of these resources and other info that I find interesting/important for locals and expats in, and travelers to, Japan and Tokyo in particular, at Tokyo Coronavirus: Is it Safe? https://medium.com/tokyo-kills-me/tokyo-coro…"
So our tout operator has just cancelled our trip to South Korea and Japan on 22nd March. Not because of the Japan part but because Japan are now tightening up entry into the country if you've come from Korea so we either wouldn't be allowed in to Japan or may be quarantined. We were going to cancel last week and lose our money but I'm so glad we held off as now we get a full refund! We'll definitely go another time.
Good luck on your trip (I'm over 60 too). We are supposed to leave 3/9 but will cancel. I want to enjoy Japan when there is no stress. It is my son's dream trip and right now fear is taking over and things are closed or shutting down. Pray it lets up before the Olympics. So many people and businesses are suffering because of this panic.
"I just received notice that United Airlines is refunding our tickets IN FULL. Previously, they had given me a travel credit, minus a fee of $300 per tickets. However, I emailed them, asking for a refund due to the coronavirus. It took 6 days for a response, but they did grant a full refund. We are so relieved and grateful. Please note these were NON-REFUNDABLE tickets. But a refund was granted anyway. Thank you United Airlines."
"Our 20 year old son is enrolled in Hosei University for two semesters beginning April 1st and is scheduled to be there until January 2021. We are scheduled to depart on March 14th, my husband and I (both in our 50's and no health issues) are there until March 30th. Our plan is to get him set up in his apartment and of course, explore Tokyo. Our son is excited to show us around since he has already been there twice in the past two years. We are on the fence about a couple of things 1. Going and 2. Leaving our son there! I must say that I have been in communication with the apartment rental company (within the past couple of days) and there has not been any mention of coronavirus concerns. And although I booked our airfare a few weeks ago (with points), when I started looking at hotels this past week it appears many still have low availability. Our son has not heard anything from his University here in the US and emailed the Tokyo University but has not received a reply yet. He is in touch with 2 other students from his US University who have told him they are still going. We were also at the Japanese Embassy here in Washington DC on Tuesday and they had him sign a document stating he had not been in China in the last 30 days. We asked them if they would still grant a Visa and they told us to pick it up in a week!I have been reading through this thread and it seems like 50/50 on people going versus cancelling. Would you go? Would you leave your 20 year old there for 10 months?"
"I am in the same boat as you. im supposed to leave march 24th. Ill be so disappointed. Hoping things improve there.Edited: 9:00 am, February 28, 2020 "
"Re:Toilet paper and tissue. They ran out in 1973 during the 1st oil shock. There was a rumor that Japan wouldn't get any oil and the factories would stop. Hence, hoarders. Then again after the earthquake/tsunami of 3/11/2011. We were having scheduled blackouts and water shortages, and the first thing people went to grab were paper products. And water. This time, there was an announcement that schools were shutting down for 2 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of spring break. KIDS at HOME can only mean one thing. More poop! And food. My theory: these days, people don't have neighbors from whom they can ask for a cup of sugar... or a roll of toilet paper. So they have to have their own stash. Hoarding is common during a ""panic"" situation. It's a shame, especially since toilet paper and tissue are MADE in Japan, and the next supply WILL come to the drugstores and supermarkets at their regular timing. The paper product factories are also now producing masks, so in time, they'll be back on the shelves. Don't hoard. Don't believe rumors. Just wash your hands, gargle, flush the toilet with the lid on, eat well, sleep well, and new suggestion from the experts..... CLEAN your toilet! (How much you wanna bet toilet cleaning supplies will be the next thing to be hoarded?!) Good hygiene is important to fight against any germ or virus. OK.... I'll get off my soap box. For now! :-)"
"We travel next week and will be in Kyoto March 9 and 10th. I am not worry about virus since I have been preparing myself to be healthy, but worry about closed places. Could you tell me about it? Also should bring toilet paper ??? so I can put it on my list."
"LA9676,Check the dates of when people were saying that they’re still coming. Even check my posts. Things were really mostly normal until yesterday. I was telling the people who were coming about how nice it has been with less crowds here. Last weekend was great. March 14 seems kind of early to get beyond this current mess. April 1st? Maybe ok? The shelves in stores were empty for a while for face masks and antibacterial products but we had toilet paper on the shelves 3 days ago. I’ve personally not been shopping today but I’ve heard it’s sold out. People are saying it’s overkill but they’re stocking up too."
"@pyrojas there is a list of closed places here:https://www.japan-guide.com/news/alerts.htmlit's likely more is to follow so keep an eye on itEdited: 9:15 am, February 28, 2020 "
"LA967, I live in PA, so I can not answer your questions the way folks can who are currently in Japan. I can tell you why I wouldn't go now, and why I wouldn't let my child go either. All schools are closed for a month. An island in the north of Japan is currently quarantined. People are now riding bikes instead of taking public transportation to avoid contact with each other. Many museums are closing, and large gatherings are being cancelled. None of this sounds relaxing, and it has an ominous tone to me. But we all have different levels of risk tolerence and these decisions are personal. I'm just answering your questions from my own viewpoint. I wish you and your family the best of luck."
"After weeks of watching the news. Following the comments on here, we just finished packing. Up early tomorrow for our flight to Tokyo. Got the masks and sanitizer. I'm excited but apprehensive. I know once we get their apprehension will fade. Had exact same feelings flying into Mumbai when attacks were happening. I will try and check in Sunday if anyone has questions from a travellers point of view. We ate flying Perth, Singapore, Haneda.Caz"
Ookanzakura and Kanhizakura will welcome you at Ueno Park and East Gardens. Have a nice flight!!
"Am waiting to hear back from my tour operator . It would appear that they would offer a credit note for any fees that they haven’t incurred so far.They are contacting Japan to see what costs have so far been paid out., I will then be able to make a decision. Although we would loose at least the air fare. Will wait and see what they say."
"I have been reading the forum daily. Thanks to all for providing information, especially locals. I am scheduled for 2 week tour throughout the country in April but have gotten progressively concerned over last two weeks. Currently, our tour operator, G Adventures, has not cancelled any of the tours in Japan and is very vague as to their procedure for doing so (“when our local people think the tour would not be enjoyable or safe”). I see that other companies use more clear criteria and are being flexible to allow rescheduling based on the situation. Everyone must assess their own risk tolerance but i will share how I am looking at it based on the facts I have gathered. I would be relatively relaxed and still go if aged 50 or less and of good health as fatalities in that group have been very low. (Using all appropriate hygiene precautions) Those over 60 are more at risk partly because they are more likely to have chronic disease like diabetes or cardiovascular disease but in addition it is known that even “healthy” older people are more likely to have excessive immune reaction to viruses like this and end up with life threatening respiratory syndrome. At some point, we may have medications widely available to halt this (or vaccines to prevent infection) but we are not there yet. Current facts based on patients so far is that about 20% of those who contract the virus will get “seriously” ill; about 5% will get critically ill and about 2% will die. Note that those who say “it is just like the flu” are mistaken as the death rate is about 20 times as high for covid-19. Again, more for those older than 60. The other wild card in all this is lack of knowledge as to how many people in Japan are infected due to policies restricting testing of those with symptoms. Hopefully more will be clarified as to true risk as well as good treatments for those who get seriously ill."
"For those in the UK worried about medical bills etc - I've got non-standard multi-trip cover and have just checked with the provider. As long as the FCO changes it's stance on visiting Tokyo, then my family is covered for the standard £10 million each, If the FCO advice does change, then we are covered for cancellation. Having been planning and saving for several years, at this point we still intend to travel, and are still looking forward to it."
"Hi, I have just-reluctantly-cancelled our 12 day trip to South Korea and Japan, departing first week in April. My husband wanted to cancel weeks ago, but I held off as our son was equally adamant we should not! I was fortunate enough to be able to cancel our main flights to/from the UK for a full refund. (Be aware that if you need to contact BA, you may struggle to get through as they are experiencing high call volumes at present.)I have two nights non-refundable hotel accommodation in Japan, plus three one way flights from South Korea with Korean Air. I will lose about £700 altogether on these, but I think cancelling was the right decision for us.I haven't cancelled our refundable accommodation in Japan yet, because if the outbreak worldwide dies down by April, if flight costs last minute to Japan aren't too expensive, I will rebook.We are gutted, but we weighed up all the odds and it just didn't seem worth taking the risk. The biggest risk factors seemed to me to be getting infected on one of our three flights or being quarantined either abroad or on our return, none of which appealed to me.I am aware that the virus is in the UK and we could get infected here, but I thought, why increase the risk? We have been to Japan before and my son and I already have flights booked for autumn, so we are luckier than most. My thoughts are with those worldwide who are struggling with the impact of this virus. :)"
We are in the same boat. Son is scheduled to study at Sophia University and we are planning to leave on 3/16 (both early 50s and planning to tour Kyoto and Hakone before getting him settled in Tokyo). Sent you a message....this is a mess!
"Interesting case here. https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3882752They suspect this man contracted the disease from his trip to Osaka but osaka only has 2 recorded cases. Hmm, how easy is it to get infected?"
I think Osaka only has one recorded case - isn't this the person they thought was cured then the virus came back a week later?
"United is suspending certain routes to Japan from USA. Routes between Tokyo and US hubs in Los Angeles and Houston would be temporarily canceled starting March 3rd through April 24th, the airline said. The once-daily Newark to Tokyo route would be reduced to just five times a week starting March 28th through April 24th. And the Honolulu to Tokyo flight will be downgraded from a Boeing 777-200 to a smaller 787-8 aircraft starting in April.https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/28/21157604/…"
"Thanks, I read all of your posts! I appreciate it. Our flights are already booked, I haven't called JAL yet to check on their cancellation policy, but probably will do in the next couple of days. Thanks so much for your input!"
"We are leaving next week Thursday for a three week trip to Japan (Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, Hiroshima and some nature in between). Just contacted our travel agency to inform about refund possibilities. The only reason why we would cancel our trip is because of the (drastic?) decision to close museums, cancel events,... We are really disappointed about this. We are not worried at all about the disease itself, confident that if correct measures are taken, we are safe. We still have three days to decide about cancellation so any feedback about this question is most welcome: with all museums closing and events cancelled, will this trip still be worth it? Any advice for changing our itinerary? Thank you very much!"
We are leaving from NZ to Tokyo 14th May. Watching very carefully but still so far hoping to visit. We have non refundable fares and have paid $600 preferred seats. We can defer our flight etc for a fee. Hopefully May will see an improvement. We will need a JR pass and i have been told we need to order this 1 month in advance to get it on time. So we have till 14th April to decide. Fingers crossed
"Ant-VP - we have the same stops as you planned in for our trip starting on Sunday. This is our second time visiting and to be honest, the first time we spent 2 weeks there never bored without going to any museums or major attractions. We looked in shops, wandered streets, ate in little food places, did nature trails and walked around temple gardens for hours - so unless your reason for going is the big attractions and museums (Disneyland, Borderless, national museums etc) I would say it’s still worth going!That said, we are considering moving our trip so we are only in Hiroshima for one afternoon. The museums are our main reason for going there, so will probably change our plans to focus on somewhere else"

"We are planning to fly on March 7th. The virus is all over now so the risks are the same in Japan as anywhere. Just be careful, wash hands and take precautions. It will be ok we aren't cancelling."
"Lol - the toilet paper news is made-up. Mis-information on social media - but Japan does that well (like other countries).I did see some interesting measures in other countries like Switzerland banning events of more than 1,000 people, but Abe's crazy move saying schools should close is not enforceable and will cause huge disruption/hardship, and keeping elementary school kids at home for a month - not too smart (just ask any parent that has had to organise holiday care for their young kids). Plus, those kids won't stay home anyway. (Niantic cancelled the local Pokemon even t this weekend too, but the players in my local area will still be out - the weather is cool but nice.)In central Tokyo yesterday I had business to attend to in Shibuya and Shinjuku - sure there were less tourists, but certainly not a ghost town. Local people still have their lives/work to get on with. As for my local neighbourhood or the trains I was riding - roughly the same number of people as a usual day."
Italy and Iran moved to warning level 3 for US. Japan still 2.
"Italy had 250 new cases and Iran, 104 yesterday, whereas Japan only had 24:https:/…Japanese Medical Association is looking into the lack of PCR test kits, and the new testing machines will soon be available in Japan, so the number might go up dramatically soon."
"@Dr. Shibuyakko - earlier in the month epidemiologists in the UK and US expressed an opinion that actual numbers (in China) might be 10 times the reported cases. Possibly there is a similar situation in Japan where the actual number of cases is much much higher, but many more mild cases or ones that present similar to many of the other winter bugs that do the rounds resulting in mild fever and generally being unwell. The implication being that the mortality is much lower than the headline rate of 2%. Is that a reasonable conclusion/assumption? (Certainly there are at risk segments of the population, and Japan certainly has a large number of older people with pre-existing conditions.)"
"JapanCustoms, the toilet paper fiasco is NOT ""made up."" It's pretty real if you go to the supermarkets and drugstores -- at least in Tokyo. Yes, the rumor that paper will disappear was ""made up."" But the people who went to the shops and bought them all out were real. Line and Twitter multiplied the ""faux news."" And gullible people bought the lies. Stay calm. Wash your hands. And don't touch your face until you do! No, a mask will not protect you from viruses, although they do help in keeping pollen out. But a good reason for wearing a mask is to ""protect"" YOU from TOUCHING YOUR OWN FACE! (Make a game to see how many times you touch your face in an hour! You'll be surprised!) It's also good manners to keep your own sneeze to yourself. Kindly do not spread your germ to others, especially in tight, confined quarters, ie train or plane."
"Just read United has canceled flights to Japan from the US through April. Perhaps based on decreased demand, but who knows."
"HiDo you mean if it goes to level 3, cancellation fees will be waived ?Not that I want that to happen, but would like to know what will be airlines criteria for a refund. I have booked with JAL.Thanks"
">>The implication being that the mortality is much lower than the headline rate of 2%. Is that a reasonable conclusion/assumption?<<Yes, I think it is a very reasonable assumption. The vast majority of death occurred in China (2,791 cases in China vs 67 out of China as of Feb 28). China's medical system just got so overwhelmed; there were not enough beds, doctors/nurses, respirators, anything. Thus many gravely ill patients who'd survived with a life support system in place perished. I have no concrete evidence to support my assumption but as a physician who has worked in the ICU with many critically ill patients for a long time, it's easy to imagine what happened in China. When you don't have enough resources, what you can do to save patients is limited."
"Only certain routes to Narita are canceled, I am scheduled to fly on March 19 from Chicago to Haneda and it is still on.Edited: 8:16 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"Yes Jacob, it is less than clear. We are scheduled on United for late May into Narita."
@boulderbill suspension of certain flights probably business decision due to decreased demand and consolidation of flights amongst partner airlines.
That certainly seems likely. I was able to find available flights from Denver to Narita in late March and mid April.
"Re: #687: Tissue and toilet paper update from Tokyo: Yup,Mamajelli is right. The full shelves of toilet paper at Family Mart as of 9:30am this morning are now, two hours later, completely sold out. The entire ""paper"" section of the Big Box drugstore near my house is also bare: except for a sign asking people to limit purchases of tissue and toilet paper to one set, per family I believe it is...So, some supplies are getting through (such as the paper at the FM this morning, but just as quickly being bought up b y people who, I suspect, are not in the ""one-per-family"" spirit..."
"Our tickets are with ANA air, not waving of cancellation fee at this time. I also had an appointment with travel nurse, and she totally recommend me to proceed with a trip. She said it’s not more dangerous than regular flu, except new and not known well. As for any trip - just be careful: thorough hand wash , wipe tables and handles , stay warm etc. And that Japan is the most safe country for traveling:)"
"Ana, I heard from Japanese people today that ANA is allegedly refunding without fees. When is your flight? I heard this because KLM is kind of ripping me off at the moment for my upcoming trip in two weeks. They said that KLM is terrible because ANA and JAL are giving refunds to Japanese passengers who are booked for trips in the next 2 weeks."
"Kobe Keith,Although KLM is the most convenient route for me, I stopped using them a couple of years back when they changed their refund policy. I couldn't risk paying upfront £4000 (2xJ Class) and risk losing the lot. Last week cancelled a Lufthansa booking LHR to Haneda on LH/ANA and got a refund less £500, I would have preferred the whole lot back of course, but those were the T&C at time of booking.  Got a full refund for a different, domestic non-refund flight from JAL but not straightforward, I had to quote them the latest info on their UK web site and there was eventually a bit of 'doing me a favour' in their response."
"We are postponing our trip, mostly due to concern over the US closing borders and/or quarantine. Just today we were able to cancel our flight with JAL with waived cancellation fee (we were given a full refund of our purchase price). The website allowed us to do everything online, so no phone call needed. Go to the JAL website international section and click on Coronavirus special considerations link. Per today 2/28, they were allowing international flights to/from Japan starting with ticket numbers 131 to cancel with no fee for tickets booked before 2/28 for travel between 2/28-3/19. I was able to cancel online with the refund coded as special consideration “refund in case of disruption: cancellation fee waived”. It showed my amount to be refunded before I cancelled it and indeed the cancellation fee was waived. Unfortunately it warns it will take up to 2 months to receive the refund, but at least we will get it back. Thank you JAL for doing the right thing and giving people options. I look forward to rebooking my trip at a later date."
"My band is supposed to play four shows in Japan from 3/12 through 3/15. My wife will be joining me and we are scheduled to leave on 3/6 to do some touristy stuff before the shows. We plan to visit and play music in Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and Kyoto. I’m really torn and don’t know if we should cancel or not, and our main concerns are whether people will come out for our shows and whether we will be able to enjoy ourselves as tourists. Being quarantined is also a concern. Thanks in advance for your input!"
"Neil, are you sure your shows are not already cancelled?!My friends who play small bars here are having their shows cancelled. My concert for next week in Osaka was cancelled today. Ben Harper in a small-ish venue. :(Edited: 4:50 am, February 29, 2020 "
The USA is maybe closing itself to people from Japan?! https://japantoday.com/category/politics/u.s…
"Hi there, Was your departure with JAL between now and 19th March? We have JAL flights booked through a travel agent and they are saying they are not getting refunds on the flights. ThanksEdited: 5:02 am, February 29, 2020 "
"Yes, our flight was scheduled for 3/13 and ticket numbers started with 131 so we met their requirements for waiver. Also, we were booked direct with JAL. We contacted them just two days ago and they said they weren’t waiving cancellation fees at that time, so I think this is a new development as of today. Hopefully your travel agency will be able to get your tickets refunded. Best of luck."
"We finally decided to cancel our trip starting March 13th to 30th. Really heatbroken, but happy that we got most of the accomodation including Airbnb refunded exept AUD 90 loss on one Airbnb with strict cancellation policy (50%, which is about $350 - so happy that they took only $90) in Kyoto.We got a full refund of our JAL economy tickets from melbourne (booked via website). Just proceed via the usual ""manage bookng"" links and it will give a ""Warning "" saying that your cancellation charges are fully refunded with a summary of the amount. Happen to see a post a post above that JAL is not refunding (travel agent response?) which is not true. See link https:/…Edited: 5:26 am, February 29, 2020 "
"SWISS air from London via Zurich won’t refund our tickets. We’re due to leave London the 19th to Tokyo, but everything is shutting down, also Naoshima Island which was a must. Not sure if it’s worth it anymore. Hoping at this point our flights will get refundable and will reschedule for next year..."
"Muri,  The various countries websites seem to differ on this and differentiate between domestic and international (mine was domestic, explorer no-refund. The UK website stated Applicable tickets All Japan domestic tickets purchased through JAL (JAL award tickets, JAL tour tickets）for flights from February 28, 2020 (Friday) - March 12, 2020 (Thursday). Initially they only wanted to refund tax; I had to bring it(the UK web site) to the attention of the call centre Eventually, after a longish consultation with presumably a manager) they conceded that the wording on the website was ambiguous and claimed that it didn't apply to explorer tickets.It seemed pretty unambiguous to me. However they said as an exception that they were going to refund me in full (but were going to change the wording on the web page !!My advice to anyone in a similar situation is check the details on the website for your locality (which may be changing daily) have this info in front of you when you phone - the site wouldn't allow me to cancel on line. And finally, if they don't give a full refund, cancel your cancellation, because it's pretty final, you've little to lose in that case (just tax refund) and as the situation is evolving, it's worth hanging on to the booking, just in case"
"Taffrail, KLM was really awful to me about 3 years ago but I like the direct flights from Osaka to Amsterdam and then i fly direct from Amsterdam to Boston. I purchased two separate round trip ticks from them directly. Their business class seats have been very cheap the past two years so that’s appealing too. I was Star Alliance Gold for a decade or so and vowed to not be overly loyal like that ever again but on my trip to Rome last month on KLM I achieved their lowest Silver level on Flying Blue or whatever it’s called. So it’s really disappointing that I’m once again being treated so poorly."
Hi RatihshvWas wondering how you get Airbnb to refund the strict policy? I have asked but they are not helping.Any guidance would be greatly appreciated
"Mellyana, if you have Skype and can call them directly in San Francisco, try that. Don’t waste time with others. I have the number. I was trying to deal with them on a corona issue and the online customer service was awful and then the Japan customer service was disgustingly awful too. I fought these thieves for 3 days. I called the USA Airbnb and in 5 minutes the woman was super understanding and did everything for me and I paid nothing. Completely satisfied with them and I’ll never deal with the Airbnb idiots in Tokyo ever again.Send me a private message if you need their number because it was annoying to find on their website. I kept getting other online options instead of a telephone number. As if they were hiding from people.Edited: 6:54 am, February 29, 2020 "
"United cancelled flights to Japan, so I did not need to stress about this decision anymore. I also managed to get full refund for my non-refundable hotels."
"I think United Airlines is reducing services to Japan by cancelling certain routes to in Japan, mostly to Narita. There will still be United flights from U.S. to Japan. For example, flights into Haneda are not cancelled. https:/…"
Hopefully those thieving Dutch criminals at KLM will change their thinking at some point soon.
"Unfortunately, our flight with JAL is slated for 3 April and that's outside the window of refunds they are offering at the moment and our tour agent is adamant, no refunds unless FCO says only essential travel. I think many travellers must be in similar positions where the cost of cancellations is very high. We have until Wed for some money back and afterwards its basically almost nothing back. I really can't understand why FCO is not giving advice not to go. Hokkaido is in state of emergency, tourist sites are closed etc.."
"Well, complain to your country. They should ban travel to Iran, Italy and South Korea before Japan."
"Actually the FCO has done so for the countries you mention but not Japan. I don't think its about complaining, but trying to understand the rationale. No need to be techy"
"The effectiveness of wearing of masks is very badly understood in these posts, people have absolutely no idea and the usual misinformation occurs, though with some basic reading it is clearer, see https:/… and here https:/…masks-and-n95-respiratorsThese are the factors:1. Covid-19 virus particle size is about 0.6-0.125 micron, not 1000 less than other flu virus as someone said.2. Sneeze droplets are as small as 0.3 micron but many are bigger and virus particles hitch a ride inside the droplet in order to potentially transmit in the air to another person.3. N95 mask can filter 0.3 micron particles, but there are many other ways virus can get inside your body such as touching eyes, mouth and nose from surface contact, around the air gap of your mask to the face.In summary the mask is physically capable of REDUCING the number of virus particles getting into the body because sneeze droplets are bigger and carry it to you, but it is NOT 100% guarantee prevention for the other reasons given, and is one method plus washing hands and others.Edited: 9:46 am, February 29, 2020 "
"I think the best thing a mask can help is to prevent others from passing any germs, making yourself feel better and it helps practice personal hygiene.People do have bad habits with touching their faces, rubbing their eyes, etc. with their hands so wearing a mask itself is a good way to prevent yourself from doing those things because you are more aware IMO."
"A mask does not cover eyes so does not reduce virus infection there, but helps in other ways. N95 rating on the mask means capable of filtering 95% of particles over 0.3 micron size which is very small but mostly the sneeze droplets of that same size or bigger in both directions from the infected person and helping to protect a healthy person."
"I know it does not cover eyes, but it helps one be more cautious to not rub their eyes with their hands when having a mask on. It's like a reminder.Some precautions is better than none. If wearing a mask helps one feels better about the situation then why not? If people believe masks aren't going to help them in this situation, then it's up to every individual. It's just a matter of choosing to wear one or not, up to the specific individual."
"HI allI have canceled my trip to Osaka for Feb 27 . It was very disappointing for me as I was looking forward to this trip for many months.The consolation was that after I e-mailed 2 hotels in Japan and asked for a full refund (for my non refundable bookings) because of the Coronavirus outbreak risk and thankfully they gave me a full refund. If you have non refundable bookings, just try to contact the hotels in Japan to request them to waive the cancellation fee. They will advise you to contact your booking agent (expedia, or Agoda, etc.) to cancel and the booking agent will in turn contact the hotels to confirm that they agreed to refund the money. After that they will refund your booking in full.I also bought 2 sim cards from Klook to be picked up in Osaka and they also refund my purchase after I requested it (eventhough it was supposed to be non refundable.)For my United flight, I received credit to be used within 1 year and a rebooking fee.To reduce your loss, just try the above."
"Kobekeith, we haven’t received word that our shows are cancelled yet. We’re playing relatively small venues so they may be less likely to cancel.https://www.instagram.com/p/B9IYwKBhgZ_/…"
"@Happy 32, We received a full refund from United, no fees and no travel credit, just a full refund. I had to apply for it, by sending an email to United, explaining the reason we were cancelling. It took a few days to get an answer, but we received a full credit,"

"Here's my current understanding of the best hygiene protocol:Health and SafetyThe best hygiene protocol is to wash your hands with soap and waterSecond best is rubbing alcohol as hand washThird is alcohol based hand sanitizerFourth is alcohol-based handi-wipesGauze face masks are sold out in Tokyo, at least sporadically. The same may be true with hand sanitizer. If you want 'em, bring your own.A word about the masks: while almost everyone in Tokyo is wearing them right now, the jury is still out re: whether they affect. the spread of the virus. HOWEVER, I choose to wear a mask indoors in public because a) it's kinda cool to be in a bank, for example, wearing a mask and no-one freaking out :-), and b) because complying with sop makes others around me feel more comfortable.Also, and I can attest to this personally, this is allergy season in Tokyo, and the masks definitely help, as do long-brimmed hats such as baseball caps (keeps the falling pollen away from your face).Rumours of toilet and tissue paper shortages are true as of 2/28. Shelves are bare. Re-supplies are being bought up faster than they can be re-stocked. This shortage is likely caused mostly, or completely, by hoarding.I'm updating a page of news and observations from an expat in Tokyo's pov at https://medium.com/tokyo-kills-me/tokyo-coro…"
I'm in awe of all the generous and knowledgeable customer service people I've talked to in the last week to understand my options about canceling trip. From full refunds to partial refunds they have all been very courteous especially given all the pressure they must be under. Kudos to all of them. I hope the industry fully recovers once this panic subsides.
"KobeKeith, Regarding your post #710, I sent you a private message."
"Rempt... I wish KLM (Dutch Airlines) would follow this lead at some point soon. That airline is ripping off Japanese customers who are cancelling trips this week!? And me too next week. Amy, I sent you the info in a private message about Airbnb! Airbnb was very fair and understanding of my individual situation and didn’t refer me to their website to see their “current policies regarding the corona virus” like the AWFUL AWFUL people at KLM have kept telling me to do. Hopefully they’ll be as understanding with you too, Amy.Edited: 6:48 pm, February 29, 2020 "

"Edit small typo correction on my earlier post #717 on the size of the Covid-19 virus it’s currently know to be as small as 0.06 micron size not 0.6 micron as I previously said. So it is about half the size of some other flu virus but this doesn’t make much more difference as the smallest sneeze droplet size that carry the smaller virus are about 0.3 micron size, which the N95 mask is rated to filter mostly 95% of the time depending on how a person uses the mask. If a person uses the mask incorrectly it will be less effective.If people are not familiar with micron sizes, a simplistic way to see it is the net (mask fabric) has holes 3m size, a person is the size of the virus at 60cm size and squeezes into a 3m size plastic beach bubble, gets shot out like a cannon at high speed (sneeze) into Godzilla’s face, Godzilla wears a giant mask and the person/virus in the beach bubble floating in air cannot get through the 3m net or mask fabric. However, if Godzilla is not wearing the mask tight to his face or has too much face hair the plastic beach bubbles can potentially go around the loose gaps of the mask against Godzilla’s face and Godzilla catches the flu.Again, it’s not about 100% stopping the virus if one wears a mask, instead reducing the chances of getting it by breathing it in through that infection transmission path. You should also do all the other infection reduction steps like hand washing etc. Even by doing all of these it will not be 100% effective but certainly give the highest percentage chance of avoiding infection or reducing the risk as much as practical to do so."
"Hi everyone. Said I would post when I got to Tokyo.Coming out of Perth, No sign of any issues at all. On arrival and departing Singapore they have like video cameras set up taking temperatures as you walk past. Didn't notice anything coming through Haneda. Staff on JAL used masks for whole flight.We got respirator masks which I found unbearable in the heat in Singapore. One thing I noticed was just how much I touch my face. Adjusting mask. Pushing hair back etc. We ate being constant with washing hands. Every time we touch something time for another bath. Not an issue. I'm more worried about touching my face. Nothing to do with virus, but just how compact Haneda is. We managed to grab a coffee. Then get our airport limo ticket. Our IC card. Pick up our wifi toggle. Tourist info bureau. People at all locations who speak english and very helpful. Been a great first impression. All in 30 min.

I just cancelled my trip from Canada. As someone who travels solo often I am aware of the additional stresses of being by myself. I am also aware United who my flight was with is already reducing flights to Japan. This wasn’t a decision I made lightly as a young healthy individual. Everyone needs to make their own decision based upon their health and timeline. The next couple of weeks is too influx for me as a frequent traveller to go abroad at this time. I hope to be in Europe this summer and Asia this fall.
"Dont be a fool. Its the flight that will get you. It only needs 1 infected passenger and as you are sharing the same air you will be at risk, I have cancelled my flight from London to Spain for this reason and will drive there"
Oh thanks Global. So kind of you.
Hi everyone.I have had a PM from a fellow trip advisor asking about our itinerary and what may or is affected and thought I should share with you all. I have to say our travel style is very relaxed and we don't plan everyday. Ie. We had planned on going into Shibya today. But we're that trashed we went and had lunch and could then check in. Crashed out and now it's midnight and awake. Baah.Anyway we have 4 days in Tokyo. Had planned to go to Hakone to see My Fuji. Hubbie thing. But weather not looking that great so may not go. As will our mario kart. We had a trip to Mt Takao planned. Weather may affect that. I believe govt building that has viewing platform is closed. Not a biggie for us.As you can see nothing really affected except by weather.Then we go off skiing to Niseko. Can't imagine how virus will affect us here. We then fly to Kyoto for 6 days. I haven't really checked to be honest what's going on there. That's two weeks away and anything can happen.Then off to Hiroshima for a few days. We are bummed out that the museum is closed till atleast the 17th March. I hope we get to see it. I saw it quickly when I was in Japan over 10 years ago and the person I was travelling with want interested. I love history so will be disappointed if we don't get to see it. But will go to Bunny island instead if that's the case.As you can see we are pretty cruisey about how we travel. If something is closed it won't destroy our holiday. Maybe a little disappointed but opens up the way to do something else.Caz
"If you would like to see Mount Fuji, I recommend Lake Kawaguchiko instead of Hakone. The weather on Tuesday seems to be good for it.https:/…You can check Live Camera during daytime.http://www.fujigoko.tv/english/"
"I understand the optimism, but I think it’s a bit naive to believe the closed museums, attractions will reopen on March 15. When Japan begins actually testing more citizens it’s likely the number of cases will increase."
Thanks Global. Yes Tuesday does look not to bad at this stage.
Hi Amy. There isn't much you can do if things are closed. Have an alternative if need be or hotel staff will have ideas. There is so much to do here if you can't do something. I think it's a case of be prepared that you may need to make changes. For us it's not a problem. We just run with it. Not everything will go to plan on any holiday. Caz
"Thank you Caz for the updates! Enjoy your trip, and stay safe!"

"Thank you for putting out such a good report. We made the decision last week to cancel our March/April trip.

I see from CDC website for advice to US travellers that travel to Japan is recommended to be postponed for ‘elderly’ persons. Not sure what age is defined by ‘elderly’ but wondering if any US citizens have now been able to cancel and claim on their insurance?We are booked to fly from U.K. on 15 March and are concerned as if everything is shutting down would prefer to rearrange for next spring but unless UK FCO recommends to cancel non essential travel we lose a lot of costs which make another trip unaffordable. Is anyone else is this position and undecided what to do?
"Hi all!I visit Japan every June and December as my work can only allow us to take time off in those two months. However, after 10 years in this job I finally managed to get extra leave (got married last year but didn't use my marriage leave) and booked to go Tokyo from 18 March to 24 March to see Sakura. It has been my wish to see Sakura in Japan and this is my only chance! However Covid-19 has to happen.I just cancelled my side trip to Hakone so as to cut down movement and chance of sharing items (shower facilities etc even though there's water but still~). Will stay in Shinjuku, and only go out for Sakura, meals and some shopping at Shibuya.I'm from Singapore and we've had our share of scarce in masks, sanitizers and toilet papers lol. I managed to get my hands on enough surgical masks, N95 and sanitizers (70% ethanol) for this trip so we are equipped. I'm very excited to go see Sakura finally. But! I'm more concerned if we will be put to do 14 days quarantine when we get back. My boss will NOT be happy. For now there is nothing on this but we never know how the plot will twist. This is the only thing pulling me back. Sigh."
"#748, No-one here is surely exactly what is meant by this, but apparently the govt is going to discourage or even disallow hanami parties under the blossoms this year. Of course, that doesn't mean you can't still stroll about, but this year the funiki, or atmosphere, could be quite different, less festive than in the past... or future!"
"Hi Traveller,We are in the same position as you and have cancelled. The FCO is unwilling to move to no to non-essential travel and when they finally do like for S Korea, they've moved really slowly, several days late and only to the specified regions and not to the country. We booked with a travel agent and they are refusing refunds and sticking to the letter of their contract. I suspect they are able to claw back some of the deposits but unwilling to channel those back to us. If we do rebook in the future we will not use a travel company. Expensive lesson learned."
"Hi Traveller, who are you flying with? Is it a package or flight only? I was booked with BA for Seoul and Japan for early April but cancelled. Have you spoken to airline?"

"I am supposed to leave from London the 19th and flying with SWISS but they have no intention to refund my flight and they have been extremely unhelpful... I am wondering why the FCO is not advising against travelling considering that they called status emergency for Hokkaido and closed all the museum, which means they are not willing to have people going around."

"We cancelled our flights and Airbnb accommodation today. Were scheduled to fly to Tokyo on 22nd March for 10 days. But with family and 10 year old daughter I though it is not worth taking the risk. Naturally disappointed as we had planned for this trip for months, but hopefully the trip whenever it happens will be completely stress free."
"Baiju80 #757, Just curious for your AirBnb accommodation, did you cancel through the host or AirBnb support time? Did you get a full refund?"
"#757, Also curious about your Airbnb cancellation experience. We are scheduled to be in Japan March 24 - April 4 and have 4 different Airbnbs booked for our trip. At this point we are still planning to go, but are planning to cancel if US increases travel advisory to a 3. I believe all 4 accommodations had pretty strict cancellation policies. Were you able to get a full refund? Did Airbnb handle the cancellations or did you just request them from the hosts?"
"3+ weeks before we're to fly into Haneda, then on to Kyoto via the Nozomi. Eight days in Kyoto for sakura. Trip has been planned for six months. Monitoring CDC, WHO. Coming from the Pacific Northwest, which has (sadly) seen the first US COVID-19 fatalities, we're not unduly concerned about Japan. Flying Delta. We can cancel our accommodation within a week of arrival with no penalty. Should CDC elevate Japan to Level 3, then that's that. We'd try again in the fall for the foliage. Life is short; experience the places that deserve to be seen."
Looks like ANA is giving full refunds for flights if your ticket starts with 205 and departs by March 19th. https:/…
We were due to go to Tokyo from April 2 to 11. We just canceled our trip with Delta. Got full refund! Will try to see the beauty of Japan once everything is calm again. Safe travels everyone and stay healthy!
https://hub.united.com/united-suspend-travel…United is suspending some flights to Japan starting Mar 8.
"Thank you for the welcome!Yes! Our tickets were non-refundable. I inquired a couple of weeks ago and was told no refund. My family members were all getting refunds from American Airlines so I decided to contact Delta today. I told them that my family members were all getting refunds from AA and asked if they could help. I also mentioned that Delta had changed my original flights so that could affect my travels also. They didn’t ask any questions and told me I qualified for refund. I was happy and sad to hear. Happy of course to get my money back. Sad because it’s so final, the cancellation of a yearlong much anticipated trip. I think airlines are being real lenient right now due to travel restrictions , rise in numbers of Coronavirus in US and Japan closures that have all occurred simultaneously. Then again maybe I got lucky. If you’re on the fence about cancellations due to lost of flight money, now is time to ask your carriers. Also, for Delta, it’s faster to message them instead if of calling. Wait time for calling was 1.5 hrs. It took about 15 min wait through messaging. Hope this helps."
"Our carrier ANA allowed cancellation of our flight for the FULL refund (last week it was still $300 per ticket cancellation fee). We were supposed to fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo on March 12. It was so long anticipated trip, and so much research and planning already done. However, decided to postpone it to better times."
"Looks like our tickets on ANA from Los Angeles are eligible for a full refund. I have not canceled yet, might wait another couple of days to see how things develop.However, I have started to look into rebooking for June. I grew up in NYC and I hated summers there, so I'm hoping the weather mid-June in Japan won't be too bad."
"#755 >>>considering that they called status emergency for Hokkaido<<<The Governor made a request/statement - there is not authority or law that backs up the statement.One of the issues the central government has is that there are no laws/powers that allow severe restrictions, so things like closures are simply ""requests"". People continue about their daily lives - having lots of places shut for a couple of weeks is going to make for bored people, and also severe economic hardship for many people."
"Phoofy, the weather from mid-June gets really humid and nasty and it’s the start of the rainy season. Some years the rain is awful and some years it’s not that bad. It’s a gamble. But it’s usually hot and muggy as ....... here. Especially if you didn’t like summers in NY."
"Has anyone had a flight fully refunded from Qantas flying from Australia to Tokyo? My flight is booked for March 9th I’ve been waiting to see but have decided to cancel and come visit my sister at a better time. I cant get through to Qantas on the phone....Edited: 7:11 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"kobekeith, June in NY wasn't the best, but more bearable than July or August. I'm currently looking at June 14 and staying until around July 1. If the humidity is at all similar to NY, even with the rain, I might still go ahead with it.Of course this is assuming that things return somewhat to normal by then."
"Hi Amanda. The only thing we got from Qantas was if we travelled through mainland China in last 14 days. Then refund, change date. But we flew via Singapore which seem to have stricter rules than Japan which was why we got offer on refunds. Email came two days before we flew out. Good luck if you have non refundable airfares through Qantas. Alan won't allow refunds. If you paid directly with airline using credit card that has insurance attached you may get lucky depending when you booked. Caz"
Thanks for your post on State of Emergency for Hokkaido. We have just emailed our hotel to see what that means for us as we arrive there Thursday. Can we go out skiing etc. If not we will then change to ski resort down Nagano way. Have just emailed my brother to see where he found snow down that way. He had trouble with good snow a few weeks ago.Caz
"Looking for some 'WWYD' advice here. I'm supposed to go to Tokyo, solo trip, from Atlanta April 26 thru May 4 on Delta. Up until now I was planning on going, but right now I'm mainly worried that this vacation that I've been planning for few months will just have a fair amount of stress attached to it, even tho I'm not concerned about actually getting sick or stranded, I still don't relish the thought of worrying on my hard earned vacation whether I washed hands, touched face, etc. I can postpone to late October 2020 without change fees with Delta (flite prices then are slightly less than price of my current) nor with Airbnb, as my place has availability for my potential travel dates in late October and host is willing to swap dates, charging a little more with change in nightly rate.I'm leaning to postpone, esp since the window leaving all arrangements intact is there right now. I have nothing booked yet in Tokyo activity-wise except a wifi router that I think can easily be switched. Main risk is that come October we're still in same boat with this virus, but my gut says likely not in 8 or so months. WWYD?? Thanks everyone."
I chickened out yesterday. Cancelled as much as I could to recoup costs and now waiting to see what our govt decides within nxt three weeks. Travelling with my young grand daughters was just too daunting and they didn't want to go. Might see Sakura time next year.
"How worried should I be for our trip to Tokyo in early June? I assume if things are bad by then, it should be a pretty apocalyptic scenario for the entire world."
Alan I would postpone - viral concerns and sites closed. Risk of quarantine on way back. Why go. Jill glad you got most of your money back

"Appreciated , cheers"
"I live in Kansai and life is relatively normal here. From day one there's been an assumption that Japan would be one of the worst hit countries due to the large numbers of Chinese travellers. The current line a lot of people are saying is because Japan isn't testing enough people the situation is far worse than it appears. However, the number of deaths recorded so far doesn't really square with that. If Japan was experiencing some kind of Italy/Iran/Korea style outbreak then you'd expect there would be many more deaths than what we've seen - and inadequate testing likely doesn't extend to people in a serious enough condition that they die from the virus. Personally, if I had a trip planned to Japan at this point I'd be more worried about catching the virus on the plane than I would be about getting it in Japan itself unless you're doing things that put you at a high risk (concerts, getting on packed subway cars, etc.)"
"Hi Jill. Given your travelling with children I think good idea. It's hard for us adults to do our best and not touch anything which we are. You can't help it. Escalators etc. We are wearing to really high tech masks that even ammonia doesn't get through and washing hands all the time. I struggle a bit with the mask because of the heat but really suctions on to your face. We are only wearing where its crowded. Mainly trains. I wouldn't want to be doing a trip with kids.

"#758 & #759I had booked the apartment in Dec 2019 and paid 50% + service charges (USD 550 approx) upfront and the remaining 50% was only due by next week. As per the cancellation policy of the host I can only get 50% refund if I am cancelling the booking after 48 hours of booking. I messaged the host about my plan to cancel and they told me to go ahead and the system will issue the refund. I did it via Airbnb website and selected the option 'extenuating circumstances' as the reason for cancellation. An immediate refund of USD 55 has been initiated and then I saw the message saying you could claim a further USD 400 (approx) which I believe is due to the COVID-19 circumstances. I have put up the reasons and have put a claim for the same. It says under process and hopefully will get that soon. If that happens then I will only lose approx USD 90Edited: 4:54 am, March 03, 2020 "

Like they should be!!!!! Color me happy! No stale beer smells and trash!!!"
"On Sunday, there were people doing hanami picnics already at that Ueno Park."
"Global, the new rule was announced today (Tuesday 3/3). They probably didn't think about it last weekend! First buds will be out around the 15th. The night lighting at Meguro River will also be limited and/or cancelled. Happy blossom viewing anyway! !"
"You're just talking about Somei Yoshino, mamajelli. This year, they won't put the lights at night and those ridiculous lanterns with stores named won't be hang on the trees. One thing I noticed is basically younger generations are coming to Japan.Ookanzakas are already in full bloom and catching attentions of people from abroad, too."
"Yes, Somei Yoshinos. That's what most people consider to be ""O Hanami."" We used to have double petals (yae zakura) in our garden when I was a child. Too many caterpillars for me to sit under those trees! lol Shinjuku Gyoen has all different varieties of cherry blossoms. It's nice to go there any time in spring!"
"Ueno Park and East Gardens of the Imperial Palace also have a lot of different Sakuras to welcome people from all over the world. I've been seeing Sakuras from September nearly every week somewhere in Tokyo. So people who put off their trips, even you miss the Somei Yoshino, you have a lot of chance of seeing them unless from mid-May to September."

"We are in Tokyo right now. If our airline was more helpful we probably would have cancelled/postponed because of the UK media panic which really stresses me out every time I look at the news, but here it seems fine. Almost everyone is in masks which I understand is a hygienic and polite thing but it does restrict breathing a bit and can make it very hot. Places are much quieter and there are less tourists but I think that’s quite nice. Nowhere is deserted though and we’ve had to change some plans to avoid crowds - such as if a restaurant we wanted looks really busy, as much as we want to try it we just pick a quieter one with less people. I am young (25) however I do have asthma, but we decided to come as the virus was in the UK city we live anyway so I’d probably catch it on my commute, plus most of the cases are in Hokkaido or from the cruise ship and we are not going near there. We wash our hands and use hand sanitiser and antibacterial wet wipes obsessively and wear our face masks. We also avoid crowds and walk to places rather than public transport when possible. Restaurants and shops are still open and very welcoming. I am enjoying the trip. Just not the anxiety caused by the media!Edited: 11:06 am, March 03, 2020 "
"One of the things that I love the most from my travels is the atmosphere of the places you visit, people watching, absorbing the culture, interacting with locals you encounter etc. Can anyone who's out there or been recently, advise if there is still an ambience of 'normal' life or has the Virus threat restricted the number of people out and about so much that the atmosphere has changed? Many thanks"
Life as usual in Tokyo with less tourists and less packed trains. I was quite surprised that the Samurai Festival was carried out at Ueno Park last weekend even the Prime Minister made requests to cancel events where people will gather. There were crowds there and the only differences you might notice there was that the staff were wearing masks. Just that.
"Our planned trip is late May, so still a long time of waiting for us."
"Wife and I have been planning our trip to Japan for the past 5 months. Currently we're booked for 03/27/2020 through 04/09/2020. We've been very excited to get to Japan as it is a bucket-list item, as well as our 5 year Wedding anniversary. Unfortunately we are now in limbo as we may cancel. Fortunately all of our hotel and ryokan bookings can be canceled no more than a week prior to check-in date. We booked our airfare direct with JAL, and currently if we cancel we'd be out $300 per ticket as we are outside the current window for free cancellation. However, that could change depending on the continued progression of the Coronavirus within Japan. Fingers crossed things will subside, and we'll have a great Anniversary trip that will be less encumbered by tourists, although I did want to see the Cherry Blossoms lit up at NakaMeguro.."
I notice a lot of locals don’t like the lanterns/lights under cherry blossoms? I’ve never seen them in person but photos look nice. Is it the similar case of Parisians don’t like the light show on Eiffel Tower?
"I'm not concerned about getting sick, but are things in Tokyo/Osaka/Kyoto shut down, or will I still be able to enjoy my trip and do all the things I want to do in Japan?"

"Great post from JazzandDazz #802 I live in Tokyo, and generally agree with the tone and tenor of their post.Despite the media's focus on a subject tending to blow things out of proportion, for the moment it is mostly business as usual in Tokyo, with some notable exceptions including site closures and event cancellations.However, I also do not mean to downplay the seriousness of the situation.

"Tykesbaby... most people are acting like they usually do. We aren’t walking around looking panicked or stressed and people aren’t crying on the streets. It’s just a little less crowded in some places and it’s still crowded in other places. If anything, tourists look more off than they normally do. It’s like they’re the scared & quiet ones and not sure how to act. My friends and I were laughing about this the other day. Tourists generally look happy and relaxed. Not so much right now. “On their way to a funeral” or they look guilty of something and have been caught or they’re waiting to talk to their bosses at work after doing something horribly wrong and they are anxiously waiting to be scolded. Must be a fun vacation. Maybe they’re just super paranoid to be on subways and trains and are nervous or on guard and after they get outside they feel “safe” and less exposed to the corona virus being spread around everywhere and that’s when they smile again?“We made it!”Edited: 4:21 pm, March 03, 2020 "

Will be flying to Tokyo on 27 Mar but now I'm not so sure anymore. Been planning this trip since monthssss ago and really hope everything can come out alright (probably not getting much refund so I have to pray very hard! Finger crossed!)
"I'm from Singapore and from experience (our peak is 'over' for now and most cases are stable or discharged) some points to note:- Even if you do have the virus, it can take up to 30 days for symptoms to appear. So when you feel well, you can still spread the virus to others. - Some patients did not have fever even though they are tested positive. So fever is not a good indication. - Mask does not prevent you from contracting the virus but can help block droplets from random people's sneezes and coughs. If you are in crowded places I would say better put on a mask.- If your immune system is compromised, I will also recommend you to put on a mask as there is also widespread of influenza.- A normal surgical mask is recommended as it is splash proof. - N95 is good but if you are not trained to wear it properly, the mask becomes useless. N95 kinda suffocates you when worn properly, so it is not comfortable. This will also put you at risk as you will be adjusting the mask often, hence touching your face. - The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 9 days. So do wipe your jackets and wash clothes every day.-For sanitizers, the alcohol content should be above 70% to be effective. - Best advice is to boost your immune system, drink more water, practice good hygiene, wash hands before and after doing things. - Take care guys!"
"First-Hand Experience from Tokyo, Wednesday March 4My usual walk from Nishi Tokyo to Kichijoji, both in western Tokyo, this morning.As before, daily life goes on with just a few cosmetic changes. The daycare centre next to my house is open for business as usual, as is the Montessori kindergarten. The local elementary and middle school in my neighbourhood are both closed for classes, but we passed on stalwart young lad with reflective backpack and yellow elementary school cap was making his lonesome way to the temporary daycare set up in one of the schools.The usual flock of bicycles as (mostly) mothers dropped off their young’uns was absent, but as we drew closer to the commuter train station a steady trickle of grey- or blue-suited salarymen and women turned into a river as the trains, of course, life blood of this city, continue to run on time. Some, though not all, wear face masks.Construction and renovation work continues apace in this growing part of the city, despite the virus - and miserable weather. The older, middle-aged in hardhats and safety vests are all masked; the young bucks, in their hakama baggy pants forego helmets and masks for clouds of cigarette smoke.I remember what young and indestructible and indestructible feels like…The local McDonald’s drive-through does a steady business but, unlike in Korea, there are no spot-check facilities outside fast food outlets to get a quick virus check. In fact, access to testing remains a major issue.If I dare to make a generalization, it seems to me that the Japanese government tends to over-think problems and micro-manage solutions, which can sometimes make a situation worse rather than better.Rant over.The first drugstore superstore I pass, just getting ready to open, is moving their produce onto the sidewalk. And… boxes and boxes of tissue paper! Literally the first I’ve seen on sale for a week.The drought is over?!? Let’s see how much is left on my return journey...Local businesses, such as the oshiburi hand cloth laundry and the concrete coring company, are already open for business as usual.Morning classes are running at the Big K Tennis School, students practicing backhands and serves on grass courts in the rain.More people on the streets, more cars and trucks on the road, as I draw closer to Kichijoji and the start of the business day. The local temples and shrines are open for those who prefer not to put their faith in masks. On Sunroad, Kichijoji’s covered shopping streets, something is clearly afoot: long line-ups have already formed outside shops whose shutters are still closed.Clearly, wor is out: tissue paper is back in stock.Starbucks looks and feels like as busy as it usually does, especially for a cold and rainy Wednesday workday morning, but milk and stir sticks are behind the counter, and you must drink from disposable paper cups.Could Trump be right? Big-name franchises are extra cautious with hygiene and quality control ‘cause they don’t want to get sued?Ask me another time about my friend who found an earwig baked into her jacket potato at a Wendy’s in Seoul…I’ll report later whether there’s still tissue for sale by the time I’m walking home.BTW, word is the central government is going to step in and control pricing and distribution of masks in Japan.

"Re: 817Hey Caroline,Thank you for the follow up. I think my biggest concern at the moment is that things could be closed that we have wanted to visit during our stay. I'll add that our itinerary is for some time in Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, and Miyajima. We are planning on some day trips as well. Hopefully things clear up, and certain places like (team borderless) are open by the time we're supposed to take our trip. The thought of going through certain places in Tokyo and Kyoto without large crowds is quite appealing, although I hate to say that based on the circumstances."
We have just got back to our hotel to have a coffee in the lounge. Where you would normally have snacks they are serving people individual plates from kitchen. Main breakfast buffet will be the same. Makes sense.Just an FYI Hiroshima museum is closed till 17th March at this stage. One of our bucket list items. Oh well.

"@AlmostJapanese90, howdie, fellow Singaporean here. Sanitisers need minimum 60% alcohol to be effective.

"Interesting remark.

"I decided to move my trip, originally scheduled for mid April to early May, to Mid November. Hopefully, the cases diminish by then.Most of my fares were non-refundable, but most vendors gave me a refund or credit.Good luck to everyone and be safe."
"Kat, the banning, er rather the ""requesting"" of banning ""blue sheets"" in parks operated by Tokyo-yo, aka Ueno, Shinjuku Gyoen, etc. is in the news. No eating or drinking, so I guess we can't use little picnic sheets, either! lol Just ""walk throughs"" and enjoy the flowers that way.

"Tykesbaby, you’re welcome ! Hopefully you’ll have a great trip."
So I just heard at work that a JR train passenger who uses the trains every day from NISHINOMIYA to Osaka has tested positive for corona and they warned us in the staff meeting to be careful!?? Thanks.
"#829 You're very welcome leloir - and thanks for the thanks :-) I must admit, it's been a little tiring trying to keep up with all the developments on the Coronavirus crisis here in Tokyo, let alone in Japan. I'm happy that the effort is making a difference!A few updates for March 5th at Tokyo Coronavirus: Is it Safe? https://medium.com/tokyo-kills-me/tokyo-coro…"
"#831As Mamajelli says, the authorities are putting restrictions on the hanami parties, where people eat and drink themselves silly on blue plastic sheets under the blossoms, in major parks and other sites. Local sites may differ. Here's a report in English, if that helps https://www.yahoo.com/news/japan-cherry-blos…More updates on Tokyo at Tokyo Coronavirus: Is it Safe 3/05 Update. https://medium.com/tokyo-kills-me/tokyo-coro…"
I moved mine back. With most things closed and the virus still causing chaos in many countries. Traveling elsewhere wasn't an option either. Hoping this shall pass. I can go later this year or maybe sometime next year. Depending how long this takes to conquer the coronavirus.
"For as much as I am not worried about the virus and wants to carry on with my trip, both me and my spouse's job (we are public servants) does not allow us to carry on. So we had to cancel our flight. The only good through this huge disappointment is that ANA will refund us fully, and we did not lose much money. Just a few dollars of admin fee for cancelling our trains booking and maybe the exchange rates after Pokemon Cafe refunds me. But dayum, I was so upset because I had waited for this one and only chance to view Sakura in Japan for soooo long! Sigh..."
Just an update on the post #790My Airbnb host communicated with Airbnb support and today I received a message from Airbnb support saying I will get a full refund.

"Thoughts concerning covid-19?General consensus from my staff today is they are sick of the lame news reporting and irrational behavior of some people they see in their local neighbourhood. Get over it, it's world-wide, not Japan specific, and there are still worse things/bugs around for you to catch when you go travelling.Still doesn't stop various events being cancelled and people staying at home/not travelling, but mostly ordinarily people here (that I see every day) are doing most of the things they would normally do."
We are due to travel to Sapporo this Sunday 8th March and we have no worries about the safety of catching the virus whilst in Japan which is highly unlikely .However the reason we have made a last minute cancellation is the issues with Australia's travel restrictions should they change whilst we are away as they have today for South Korea and very likely Italy the way it is escalating . Should this also include Japan which is also Level 2 then on return a 14 day self isolation would be required so anyone travelling needs to factor in the very real possibility of extra time away from every day activities once they get back to Australia .
"Still trying to get to Japan the 19th from London (via Zurich). SWISS air is not offering refund but at the same time is reducing a lot of flights to/ from Zurich/Osaka/Tokyo. https:/…breaking-newsThey won't release any specific info until 5 days before the flight, so we will just to wait and see... Any suggestion on any destination corona free? :)"
I can totally understand your staff sentiments Japan tours. All this reporting makes Japan look really dangerous when to a certain extent it's not. Look at Italy. Plus it must be so worrying for them with maybe losing their jobs as well.
"Sadly for me, Japan is part of a wider itinerary which is: London - Madrid - New York - Tokyo - New Delhi - London. It's a 47 day trip beginning in mid March with 9 days in Tokyo so I'm trying to keep abreast of each country's developments. Yesterday India cancelled the visas for nationals of Japan or foreigners heading from Japan, which is bad news. A snippet from their official immigration page:Visas/e-Visas granted to all foreign nationals who have travelled to Peoples Republic of China, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Japan on or after 01.02.2020, and who have not yet entered India stand suspended with immediate effect. Such foreign nationals may not enter India ... Those requiring to travel to India under compelling circumstances may apply for fresh visa to nearest Indian Embassy/ConsulateAll well and good but when I called the Indian embassy to try for a fresh visa they're now insisting I'll be denied entry which contradicts the official statement. Am now looking to see if there's a workaround."
"I hope this doesn't come off as being ignorant/inconsiderate or anything, and I didn't want to create another thread regarding coronavirus. I just want more insight.If I do decide to travel to Japan and upon coming home, my biggest worries is my parents at home. I am not worried about catching the virus as I am healthy and under 30, and will be very cautious about my personal hygiene, BUT just incase by any chance I might be carrying the virus without any symptoms, I wouldn't want to pass it to my parents who are in their 60s.BUT.... If I choose to stay in my own room majority of the time when I return home, besides the occasional bathroom usages , and disinfecting everything I touch in the bathroom, will my parents be okay? I read online mostly about how the virus spreads through droplets and large crowded groups and touching surfaces that has been contaminated.Just wanted some opinions will it be relatively safe for my parents."

"I see mention of people moving their trip because of things being closed, but what things are closed? Have their been any closures announced that go into April?"
@lovepastries here's a list of things closed:https://www.japan-guide.com/news/alerts.htmlMost are till mid-march now but I guess they will decide every week if they add an extra week of closure or not. Hard to predict what will be still closed in april.
"The Japanese Government won't make any announcement until mid March, watching if they can delay the speed of spread or not. We are finding out that there are certain clusters at livehouses, fitness clubs, pingpong gym and a shopping fair, so I hope they would reopen the museums but we still don't know how long the closures will be."
"Dang, while happily for me most o the closures are not things I am interested in, I see several castles/palaces closed. One specifies interior, but the others do not. Does that mean that Osaka Castle and Ninomaru Palace for instance are even restricted access on the outside?"
"#846 in the unlikely event you become an unknown virus carrier your parents will be at high risk in the same house unless there is some kind of physical separation in living space for 14 days and they should not traverse over the same space as you. The virus is believed to remain viable and infective 7-9 days on surfaces (door knobs, benches, clothing, light switches, eating utensils etc). Best to move somewhere else in self quarantine for 14 days.Based on figures from China 80% of deaths in the 60+ age group with underlying health issues and it’s about 15% chance of fatality so 1 in 6 chance very high, but in a country with better health system that might halve, still too high. However, even with current situation in Japan the probability of being infected is still low vs the total population and you could try minimise that.Read here precautions from Coronavirus virology specialist note to his families and friends to understand the nature of the virus https:/…"

There are medical experts here so i would like to ask if getting a pneumonia jab help? I know it does not make you immune to covid19 but if you get infected the jab ensures you won’t progress to pneumonia which is when the illness is most damaging?
I’d probably trust the person jabbing me more than the TripAdvisor medical “professionals” on a travel forum. No? I’d ask my doctor face to face.
"Kobe, there are a few docs here you know?"
I’d only trust Shibuyakko because I’ve “known” her for over a decade but would still ask my own doctor rather than people on a travel forum.
"Dear Dr. Shibuyakko,Since we're discussing such technical medical questions, I wonder if you would answer this for me, if you know:What is the relation between the face masks that we civilians buy in the drugstore vs. the surgical masks doctors wear for example in the operating theatre?Surely what doctors wear in the operating theatre are more robust, and perhaps customizable, than the flimsy mouth and nose covers that do help us allergy sufferes but, I suspect, few else?Is the current shortage of face masks in Japan, and rumours that China will close off all supplies outside the country, truly affecting doctors' access to needed surgical masks?i've also heard that the Japanese gov't is going to step in to regulate pricing and distribution."
">>There are medical experts here so i would like to ask if getting a pneumonia jab help? I know it does not make you immune to covid19 but if you get infected the jab ensures you won’t progress to pneumonia which is when the illness is most damaging?<<The pneumonia vaccine protects you against pneumococcal bacteria, and it has no effects on any virus including COVID-19."
"The masks you can get at a drug store and even a regular surgical mask won't protect you from virus as they're not designed to keep out viral particles, and they're not nearly as tightly fitted around your nose and cheeks.The only mask that can protect you from virus is an N95 Respirator. You need to practice to get it fit properly on your face. It's really uncomfortable until you get used to it. You feel as if you're suffocating when an N 95 is tightly fitted."
"So it begins in our state now...Today Maryland governor announced three confirmed cases in Montgomery County. All 3 person traveled internationally to undisclosed country and returned on Feb 20th. They were not tested until this week and confirmed as positive. The risk of getting affected from travel doesn't look too low right now.Although CDC only listed Level 2 warning for Japan now, it does have the following statement:Limit contact with others and monitor your health for 14 days after returning to the United States (https:/…coronavirus-japan)Basically this means self quarantine after travel. For working person or family with school age kids, this will be very hard on schedule and might be deciding factors in our final travel decision. Our trip is scheduled at beginning of April, so we are watching the development of situation. Looks like Japan might have the approval to declare state of emergency next week. Hopefully JAL will extend the free cancellation from March 19th to early April, which will make our decision much easier. It is not a good time for travel now with so much uncertainties across the world and possible flight cancellation/govern quarantine policy changes."
"Getting an influenza jab may help protect you against the flu. No it won’t help with covid19 but it will be one less thing you are exposed to, and the symptoms for each are similar. So people with flu may end up getting tested for corona. But if you have had the influenza vaccine less likely to get flu. Less need to test for coronavirus"
"#865. Thanks, doc.I have always thought pneumonia is pneumonia. So there are many different viruses/bacteria that can caused pneumonia? the one arising from covid19 is not the same as the usual pneumonia which you say is caused by the pneumococcal bacteria. Then what’s the point of getting a pneumonia jab if it only protect against only one type of pneumonia unless the large large majority of pneumonia is caused by the pneumococcal bacteria? Like what %? I have been contemplating getting a pneumonia shot because it is recommended for seniors and i am mid 50s already."
I’m not a doctor but I was recently hospitalized with a bacterial blood infection that started with a urinary tract infection.What I understand about the pneumococcal vaccine is that because I've had it I’ll never get a bacterial blood infection stemming from pneumonia.
We were due to fly out this Sunday from Australia to Club Med Tomamu on a 2 week ski holiday with our 7 yr old grandson but cancelled this morning as schools and many work places here are starting their own regulations regarding self isolation for pupils and staff on return . Anyone travelling to Japan and several other listed countries needs to factor in the very real possibility of an additional 14 days of quarantine on return . Also another consideration is it is not unusual to contract a cold whilst travelling at the best of times and if you are showing any signs at all when boarding a flight you can be refused travel as is now a frequent occurrence here . All too many issues at present especially travelling with children so we have decided to postpone till next year . Ended up around $450 in total out of pocket with cancellation fees e.t.c

"Also note many lay persons may think a medical doctor can answer all questions and are in fact good generalists and a place to start, but there is a much wider field of experts in many areas that do not have or need medical qualifications to make an expert comment. Every one collectively gets their knowledge from such wide field of experts. For example, a microbiologist who is not a medical doctor can have more specialist knowledge than a general practice medical doctor, hospital and mechanical engineers know more about ventilation systems to prevent building and aircraft air quality contamination and product design and specifications of mask and filtration systems, water quality, hygiene and sanitation experts etc.Edited: 10:23 am, March 06, 2020 "

Hi Gang.Further update. It appears if you decide to come be prepared for flight cancellations. We have already had one cancelled and got another cancelled. As we are travelling on points we have been left stranded as even though there is probably seats if your flying on points that's a whole different story. Luckily this flight isn't till 16th March so have time to find out if our travel insurance will cover it or we need to cover the cost ourselves. So I can't express how important it is to have funds available to cover changes from left field. We were flying business class on points. If we have to pay down the back of the bus we go. First world problem.Caz
"What airline are you flying with, Caz? We’re flying. Brisbane to Osaka via Singapore with Singapore Air and I believe if one of our flights is cancelled or significantly changed, SA will allow us free cancellation of the entire trip. But we didn’t use points. Have you asked your airline if you’re eligible for free cancellation?"
"Hmn. Just had a post removed from TAF because, as one replier put it, the information it contained was ""not really travel related."" That post contained guidelines from the CDC, the FDA, FEMA, and the American Red Cross on how to prepare for and cope with emergencies at home and abroad. The guidelines included that, among other things, travelers to hot spots try to take a 30-day supply of prescription medication. Also that travelers already in-country and caught up in a quarantine should think in terms of self-sufficiency for a two-week period, with lots of specific examples.It also included a link to an itemized first aid kit, as well as suggestions as to where such ready-made kits can be found from Canada, the US, Japan - really anywhere.In other words, the (polite) reply missed my point: how to be prepared.I was disappointed by the response, especially since as a long-time participant on these boards I greatly respect the replier, and consider him to be one of the most reliable sources on this forum.Then I come across this thread. To my surprise, the same expert who claims my guidelines on self-sufficiency in hot spots and quarantines is dispensing a generic handout on different types of influenza vaccinations. I will simply say for now that I still respect the expert, but I ask: In what way is family-doctor level advice on influenza vaccinations more travel-related than information on preparations for possible quarantine before or during a trip, at a time in the world when the chances of such a quarantine occurring, perhaps imminently, has never been higher?Note that I have not petitioned to have any of these posts removed, since i believe that in general we are all better off when we share information. Is it specifically travel-related to know about different types of flu vaccinations? Nope. But it's still valuable info, worth sharing, and may help a traveler or other make a wise, even life-saving decision. As is the suggestion that, in the case you may be stranded in a foreign country by circumstances beyond your control, having extra prescription meds on hand might just save your life. Literally."
"#882, the post may have been reported by other members and not the poster who replied. Unless you have proof, it is best not to jump to conclusions.I think flu vaccines are travel-related but medical advice should be sought from one’s doctor and not over the internet.Edited: 11:43 pm, March 06, 2020 "
I’m not sure but I think it takes 3 or 4 people to report a post to have it removed from a thread. It’s definitely more than just 1 person though.
"Btw, penumonia vaccines and flu vaccines are not the same."
"#883 minxbaby, yes you are correct that I strongly imply one specific person wanted the post removed. Perhaps that's not fqir of me.If I am wrong, i wholeheartedly apologize by the implication.It is for two reasons that I responded the way I did.First, the only reply before the post was taken down reads""Your info re first aid and Health/safety are all good, but again not really travel related. I think it's better if you can find more appropriate forums to post your excellent info.""""I'm only saying this as I see so many non travel related topics on this forum these days.""So again, I agree that I jumped to a conclusion. And if I am wrong, I'm sorry.What i will say definitively, however, is that the only person who criticized my post for ""being ""not travel related"" can be accused of doing the same thing here, posting general advice about pneumonia shots. Important? Yes. Travel-related? No more than the guidelines I posted.kobekeith, I'm not sure, but i've had some posts deleted (and subsequently restored) in the past, and have had some posts removed myself.My impression, based on turnaround times and these previous exeriences: requests to have a post removed from a non-expert may take more time and possibly more than one request. However, I believe it might take only one Destination Expert's rec to remove a post.One reason I think so is that in almost every case (can't think of an exception) every post of mine that has been removed over the years has ultimately been restored. Given the frequency with which posts are restored suggests that it doesn't take much to have a post removed - at least in some cases.Again I apologize if I have jumped to the wrong conclusion. As I said in my previous message, i highly respect the expert who replied to me. But the language of the reply leads me to think that if that person wasn't the one who had it removed, their unfair criticism of my post certainly did not help."
"MinxbabyWhy do you keep so strongly recommending that people don’t travel to Japan? Are you a medical expert of some kind?We are a couple in our sixties who intend to travel there on the 28 March for eight days unless our country lifts the alert level or our airline cancels flights there.We have travel insurance which will cover medical expenses if by some small chance we catch Covid-19 or some other illness. We’re going to Osaka to visit our daughter and grandchildren whom we haven’t seen for 15 months, so want to go ahead with this trip if we can.It seems to me that you have been influenced by the hysteria generated by the Press. Or is there some other reason you keep telling people not to travel?"
"#882 I haven't reported any of your posts, but if you're looking for feedback, I'd say your posts contain some good info, but for me they started to be way too long, redundant, impersonal, and that they didn't really contain the type of info I was looking for. I honestly started skimming/skipping over them days ago. That's not to say you should stop posting or post any differently. I never saw anything that I felt needed to be flagged as inappropriate.I'm here because I'm still evaluating the viability of my upcoming vacation. So for me, the type of info I find most valuable is not health and safety info (that's easy to find on every news site), but rather personal stories from people that cancelled their trip, are worried about visiting, or are in Japan: closed tourist attractions, cancelled flights, screenings, quarantines, restaurants, supplies that are sold out, trip reports, fear level, how tourists feel they are being treated by locals, airlines, government officials, etc."
"Thanks for the honest feedback, Ika Musume! I genuinely appreciate it.I understand your perspective and priorities, and agree that these forums are great places to hear first-hand reports (which is how my main post started out). Unfortunately, one problem I quickly discovered is that, especially at first, and still to an extent now, there is little to no comprehensive coverage of many of these issues, such as closures. I've looked for them, and they're all a little different. One purpose I had in mind with my post was to compile the best of an eclectic mix of information as filtered by me based on personal experience as a long-term expat, other expats, experts, etc. But it's kind of an overwhelming task, which may show through in the change of tone...As for the health and safety info, yup that's becoming more widespread knowledge but personally I think there's an audience that needs to be informed - including travelers. These boards, this thread included, are still full of people debating and looking for basic info.Again, thanks for your honest input! I'm going to consider more deeply what you said about the impersonal tone of my recent posts. Also the length..."
@tokyoaaron02I know you think I took your post down but it was not me. I replied to you and said what I wanted to say. Remember that people who report a post usually don’t bother to reply to it. When I report a post I never bother to reply. Also it takes more than a few reports from different members to take down a post.
">>>However, I believe it might take only one Destination Expert's rec to remove a post.<<<I wish I had such a power but no, a DE’s vote counts as one just like yours."
"#890 & #891 Dr Shibuyakko,Then my sincere apologies. As I said before, I jumped to conclusions, with the result being what usually happens: I made an a** of myself.I am genuinely shocked that anyone would have considered the post inappropriate for this forum, but clearly I am mistaken.Again, I appreciate the tone with which you replied in the first and follow-up posts. But I'll understand if you don't feel like being quite so polite in future replies! At least for a while. I hope to earn your respect back as we both continue to post here.Peace,tokyoaaron"
#891Thanks also for clarifying the powers of the destination expert in the ongoing mystery of the post deletion process :-)
"#880Caz, your post about having your flights cancelled is the first in this long thread that has really given me pause about going ahead with our trip in early April. Amongst the worries of illness and closures and quarantines, it hadn't even occurred to me that our flight, booked a year ago with miles, could just disappear! And that we'd then have to figure out a new way home and probably end up paying for the privilege, yikes!Please keep sharing your experience on the ground in Japan, it's truly appreciated. Fingers crossed for you that it all shakes out in the end!"
"#892No worries. I don’t get upset that easily. And I understand your disappointment in seeing the post you put lots of time and effort into taken down. That post had excellent info that can help many people so I recommend posting it on an expat forum such as gaijinpot. Best RegardsSEdited: 2:42 am, March 07, 2020 "
"Cheers Dr. Shibuyakko. Thanks for being so cool about my misunderstanding - and for your feedback on the quality of information! That's what I was hoping to confirm with you and any other experts in the field.Peace,tokyoaaron"
"PS - Haven't been on Gaijinpot in years. Never really participated there, as discussions always seemed to end up in a flame war. Has it gone through a transformation, in your experience?"
"OceanSkyBeach,My country started having the coronavirus about the same time as Japan and our forums were flooded with the same sort of queries. My advice has nothing to do with hysteria. I have always had high regard for Japan’s quality of life and hygiene standards but I was deeply disappointed with the way the DP case was handled by the government. The low number of cases in Japan initially could be attributed to a lack of testing due to over-stringent criteria so the confirmed cases were only the tip of the iceberg. Recently I can see that the number of cases is spiking in other countries as well save for a few. A resident in my country caught the virus after returning from Germany recently so the risk of catching the virus while overseas is real. It is not going to get better so soon especially when you consider self-isolation in Japan is only a request and another problem is cancellation/reduction of flights in the next few months. My country’s government has advised against non-essential travel to Japan so that is what I would advise residents of Singapore to follow. You must of course make your own decision based on your particular circumstances and assessment.Edited: 4:29 am, March 07, 2020 "
Hi Ocean.We booked through Qantas flying Cathay. Cathay have changed the flight 3 times before they cancelled. I have spoken to Qantas and only thing that was available was Emirates to Dubai and then back to Bali. That's a really long way around. We would get all our points back I think. Qantas said to give it a few days and see if anything comes up but not likely.
"Hi CarolineSo do you really badly want to make this trip to Japan? Or if they gave you back your points could you make it some other time? I’d like to see our daughter and grandchildren in March/April, but if Singapore Air offered a refund I think I’d take it and delay our trip.Or if Australia raised the alert level to 3, that would also make me think we’d be better off delaying the trip.I just keep thinking what a disaster it could be if we go and one or both of us get covid-19. Would we be held in Osaka and not be able to fly home for weeks?Would we then regret not delaying the trip? It’s hard to decide on the best course of action."
"It seems many posters here are only concerned about getting quarantined for 14 days when they return to their home country. I think the most serious situation would be for someone to catch the Covid-19 during travel but does not realize it because of no symptoms. That person would then goes home and go about the normal daily routines and expose a large number of people. That will create danger for a lot of older people as well as cause financial ruins to a lot of business.Case in point, the three people that returned to Maryland after an Egyptian cruise without knowing they caught the virus. One went to a party at a retirement community and exposed hundreds of people there, many are older folks as it is a retirement community. Another went to a function near Philadelphia, now 5 schools there are closed as a precaution. No one realized anything wrong at the time because everyone looked healthy.One of unique danger of Covid-19 is that people who get infected may stay asymptomatic for a longer period, that makes it hard to people to detect the carriers and avoid contact with them."
So my flight was for April 1st with United and was able to call today and they changed it for no fee to May 27th. That also means if I have to cancel it in May it is free to change to anytime in a year from today. I was visiting my daughter who lives there and she thought best to change since a lot is closed and felt we would have more fun when the stress will hopefully be less. I was also concerned about maybe bringing the virus back to my older parents. I have been to Japan several times and I know Japan is doing there best since everything is so efficient.

#901: one can unknowingly spread A LOT of things to other people. The only way to feel “safe” is to avoid all human contact.
"#904, I would not know all the ""A LOT"" of things you have in mind that people can spread. Currently, the top topic in everyone's mind is Coronavirus. I do respect your wish to feel care free, who doesn't?"
"One can have the flu and be asymptomatic. To me, your post implies some kind of guilt to people who choose to travel."
"#906, I don't know where you get that idea and why you feel that people who choose to travel during this Coronavirus crisis should feel guilt or guilt free. Everyone should follow his or her conscience and make their own decision.Just ask yourself, if you come home with the virus and infect someone you care about, would you feel guilt? No one can answer that question for you. People in your immediate social circle may have their views, if they care to share.I cancelled my trip to Asia a month ago. Before I did, none of my co-workers or friends raised any concern. When I did cancel, some of closer ones told me privately their sigh of relief."
"#902, United Airlines has the most liberal policy for changes now. They even send me an email about the free change policies even though I have no pending trip this year with them.I hope the other major airlines would follow. This is a good way to build loyalty. I cancelled my trip to Asia for now, but stand ready to make that trip as soon as this thing is over."
"I am waiting for AA to do something, It's disappointing that United and Delta are working with people but not American. Rethinking who I fly with in the future. They came out and said the same thing about March 1 - March 31, if you buy between then you can change the flight free of charge if you want. How terrible is that, all they care about is ensuring people keep buying flights, who cares about the people who have flights now."
"I got a similar notice from SQ:""Your safety is a top priority at Singapore Airlines. We are waiving change fees for bookings made now through 31 March 2020 so that you can plan and book with confidence.""They are also offering 25% off. The cheapest business class fare is $2,845 which is as low as you can expect. I wish I can cancel my booking and rebook with that fare!"
"hfot2, you are exactly right. I went back and look at that email again, it only apply to new bookings like you described. No wonder that they send me that email, they are just trying to fill the planes.I am taking back my brownie points for them. :-)"
"HiI got United to waive my future rebooking fees for my flights which I already cancelled (from Feb 26 to March 12) to Osaka, but not a full refund, only a credit to be used within 12 months.I argued that my flights are still within March which should be comparable to new bookings.Edited: 5:19 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"My flight departing Mar 19 was booked last Dec 1 with UA.They can't issue me a refund if I cancel the ticket, but give me a credit with rebooking fee waived. I was told that, in order to use the credit, I will have to book a new flight with departure date earlier than Dec 1 this year, one year from the date when the original ticket was booked,I wonder if this is right."
instead of one year from the date the credit is issued.
"#915, that sounds about right. The ticket itself has a one year validity period from the date of issuance. So they are waiving change fees for reservations tied to that ticket, they are not cancelling the old ticket and issue you a new one."
"We’ve decided early December to finally see Japan before we have kids and went ahead and booked the plane and Airbnb for a three week stay. And hours of planning (thanks to the nice people on these forums who have been helpful). I’ve been following all the news and this forum daily since the beginning. Up until yesterday the plan was to go, as we are young and healthy. Then my husbands work sent out an email requiring anyone traveling to Japan to self quarantine for 14 days upon return, so now that’s a dilemma. We both have the option to work from home during that time, but I guess that email made me question the health and safety of the people around us upon return. Maybe we were a bit too optimistic about this whole situation or in denial of the consequences. As of now Singapore Air and AirBnB are not offering refunds for travel to Japan. Now I’m just waiting to see what PM Abe will announce on Tuesday. One things been clear Japan is under reporting their numbers, but seems like at end of the past week they started to step up."
"@minimalistgrl,airBnb has allowance for Extenuating circumstances. Have you tried calling them to cancel your booking for a full refund? I had no problems getting a refund from airbnb for the non refundable service fees."
"happy32 thank you for that info. I had messaged them early February about it, so they might have changed policy since then about the service fee. Two of my reservations are strict, so they’ll only refund 50% as of now. Although I didn’t reach out to the hosts to ask if they’ll make an exception, feel bad. Do you know if AirBnB will cover the full reservation or just their service fee?"
I’ve been hearing from others on here that they’ve gotten full refunds for their Airbnb reservations. Calling them directly may be better for you. That’s what I did in February.
"@minimalistgrl,I believe that Japan will qualify for their Extenuating circumstances policy for the coronavirus outbreak. So you should get a full refund. I would call them directly and speak to an agent about your bookings. They might have to reach out to the host for you."
"Yesterday planned to cancel due to Extenuating Circumstances, but was afraid they might not approve, hence why decided to wait until next week. I will take your advise and call them instead. Will report back."
"@minimalistgrl that sucks about self quarantining for 14 days because of work policy regarding corona virus. I got 10 days vacation coming up, my goal was to travel to japan during sakura. my work has not instituted a policy regarding self quarantining for 14 days after coming back, but the answer is quite obvious that If I bring it up, they'll frown upon me if i tell them I'm going to japan at the end of march, and they will institute a policy of self quarantine for 14 days for the safety of my coworkers and the people I work with.So with the situation, I'm not even gonna try to go to Japan or abroad. I'm considering flying to hawaii though. America doesn't frown upon traveling within the country, but they will frown upon traveling overseas."
"There is also information on the airbnb website which would seem to address the circumstances developing outside China, Italy, and Korea, in Japan and elsewhere. Look in the ""Other global scenarios that require documentation"" section at the end of the document for (worldwide?) policies on various COVID-related scenarios. Coronavirus information and extenuating circumstances policy https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2701/cor…I update a list of such info at Tokyo Coronavirus: Is it Safe 3/08 Update for other Corona-related info of interest to travelers, locals, and expats. https://medium.com/tokyo-kills-me/tokyo-coro…"
"minimalistgrl, When I spoke to an AirBnb representative on March 4 simply by messaging them, they told me “As of the moment Japan was not part of their Extenuating Circumstances policy”. BUT they do make exceptions if you look through the list and they might refund you. Best to reach out and see what they have to say and have any documents to provide for them if they ask. I asked for a full refund on 3/6 as the airline suspended my flight on the website. I provided a screen shot image of what the airline posted on their website and of my itinerary and they offered me a refund right away and I already see the funds processing in my PayPal account. Good luck to you!"
Deleted Post update: I'm happy to see that the moderators have agreed with me and re--closed the topic For C&C: Draft of Coping with Coronavirus https:/…105918800 Not bragging or re-starting a finished discussion. No need for further comment. Just closure on an upsetting situation happily resolved :-)
"hi minimalistgrl, I also booked with Singapore Air thru Expedia and their update on Covid-19 doesnt include Japan - and you are defintely right about Japan under-reporting their confirmed cases! They are also performing the test in a much slower rate compare to S. Korea. Hopefully next week it is going to change...and we can all get a flexible service options from airlines for full refund"
"Hi NddrewCan you tell me what you mean by your last sentence please. We have flights with Singapore Air and all we’ve been offered so far is free change of dates up until 31 August, which doesn’t help much.Are you saying they’ll allow free cancellation from next week? Why would they do that?"
"#929 ""you are defintely right about Japan under-reporting their confirmed cases!""Don't make up rumors. Some patients are reported not having the PCR tests until they got to the 4th hospitals, but disclosure seems to be done with press conference properly even the English version update is a bit slow.https:/…newpage_00032.htmlI don't know why South Korea had that much test kits, but the speed of carrying out PCR tests in Japan might be the same with the US. Too bad that you cannot get full refund, but the speed of spread is much faster in Italy, France and Germany now, I guess."
“Beware of the deflections and coverups and the ones who defend the indefensible”The truths are everywhere.... we know it. Can’t hide it anymore.
"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/If you're sane, could you give sources or back up what you write, #932?Listening to the doctors' interview on TV, they say it is really hard to detect at the initial stage. Some say the symptoms are similar to colds. Many of the patients are tested with flu kit and tested negagive.I will admit the procedure used to be quite troublesome not letting the doctors order the PCR tests directly but from last week they can order without the local health care center approvements."
"lol... yes. The truth is insane in Japan. Keep deflecting and trying to put the focus on other countries to cover up the shame. That used to work before the truths came out. The world is watching. The truths are everywhere. Silence the nationalists trying to cover up everything! The failures of the Diamond Princess tells so much.So glad a Japanese doctor who actually saw the conditions on the Diamond Princess told the truth to the world. Worse conditions than third world countries. The truths ! But the nationalists will cover it up and lie. :)Edited: 4:26 am, March 08, 2020 "
Can’t wait for the idiot’s speech on the 10th!
"Keith, do you have a fever? You sound like Nietzsche to me.I hope the US will do better with Grand Princess. 3000 or more is a huge number, not an easy mission to be solved. Still the international patients of DP are taking up the beds in the Metropolitan until they will be discharged.Edited: 4:35 am, March 08, 2020 "
"Lol. Yes. I do. But keep deflecting. It proves the point. Never tell the truth about japan. Lie to everyone. Maybe they will believe it. Instead of addressing the issues of Japan in a japan forum , let’s talk about other countries’ failings. Or potential failings. Deflect deflect deflect. Pathetic nationalists."
Let’s avoid Japan’s violations of human rights all the time or how the schools in Japan are like the Catholic Church in the 20th century too. Sad how the students of japan get abused on the daily which is against the laws but Japanese nationalists bring up gun violence or drug problems in other countries and don’t care about protecting Japanese children. Protecting a fake image is more important. Shame on you all! The truths are everywhere.
"Oh, you have a fever. Please see a doctor, Keith. I'm not sure a physician or a shriek or both are necessary for you.:-) Maybe a good sleep will do. The question here at a travel forum is if the threat of corona-virus is high enough for airlines companies or other countries to cancel their flight or advise their people from unnecessary travels.Because not some are judging that way, some people are not getting their refunds, right?"
Everyone should take note that the nationalists are happy that there’s another cruise ship in a different country having problems. They’re so happy it’ll maybe make Japan less idiotic or less incompetent. Lol. It’s so shameful that they don’t have any concern for the souls on that cruise ship. Fingers crossed that the other country will fail worse than the most shameful story on earth! Disgusting.
The truths are everywhere...
"Keith, if you don’t like the country’s politics and attitude so much, why are you still there? I’m an expat myself, there are many things wrong with the UK, but if I were as miserable as you are, I’d change the scenery."
"Tell that to immigrants in your home country and that’s racist. Foolish thinking. Sharing the truths is a bad thing ?!?? My students are amazing. I get the highest evaluations EVERY school year. Higher than Japanese PE teachers which is saying something. That’s my main goal here. My work and I love it. I think the abuse of Japanese students is bad. Should I return to my home country because I am in line with the laws? It’s not like I’m in a country where abusing students is legal and I should accept it. I think women should be treated better. Should I be silenced?! Female only train cars were established for a reason. This year is the year when I’ve spent half of my life here. Should I be deported or silenced for having opinions that aren’t in line with the nationalists or expats who have sold their souls? I’d be just as vocal in ANY country against all injustices. I have a right to say what’s amazing about japan and what is WRONG. I love a lot and dislike a lot. Sorry I’m not kissing Japan’s A.....My soul isn’t for sale. I’ll stand up for women and students every day of the week. But, keep silent, bury your head in the sand and keep supporting the old ways. I guess I should lie like so many others in order to keep the “enchanted forest” image alive.Edited: 1:57 am, March 09, 2020 "
"Can we get back on topic please. I'm sure there is another forum for people to voice their displeasure with their government.Like the majority of us here...we are trying to find out if we should visit or not visit Japan in the up coming weeks. This thread has proven very valuable for helping me make a informed decision but lately a few have gone off topic. Thanks for your understanding!Edited: 9:50 am, March 08, 2020 "
"Starting a new thread with a concrete question will be better for that, duuhdadada.The numbers of cases confirmed in the US and Japan will soon be the same.Edited: 10:03 am, March 08, 2020 "
Try the “I’m still going to Japan” thread if you want to know what’s actually happening in Japan now. It’s too bad the Japanese nationalists are all covering up the facts about what’s going on here. :(But they all stick together. A collective secret.
"""The numbers of cases confirmed in the US and Japan will soon be the same.""Sadly I think you will be proven right in short order, as more test kits become available in the U.S. Right now, it is 437 in the U.S. and 502 in Japan. I don't know if they count those on a cruise ship about to dock in Oakland, California with 21 confirmed cases."
"Global715255 The issue is the way the government is handling the situation not blaming the health care workers, how can the medics detect every case without the proper quantity of lab tests at their disposal. With the cruise ship, they took the situation lightly and didn’t look ahead to the consequences. Let’s hope next week things will change. Going back to AirBnB yes there’s a list for every country effected, but Japan is simply on the list. Unless CDC level reaches 3 or our flights been cancelled (which I doubt at this point considering it’s at least half full), we don’t qualify for a refund, but will take advise of others and call them directly. Although for those who are older, should have an easier time receiving a refund, rightfully so. With Singapore Air, they’re not offering refunds, but free change of date with the latest departure date before August 31st. Unfortunately, that’s not an option for us either, my husband has a project starting at end of April, so this year it was our only opportunity. We are young and healthy, but at this point it’s also a question of enjoyment, I want to relax and enjoy the country without worrying about any possible restrictions, cancelations, etc. That doesn’t sound like an adventure or add good memories. It’s interesting to me how people are one sided too, traveling to Japan is unsafe now, but within the United States perfectly ok. If we’re not flying to Japan (which was direct), certainly not getting on a plane period, otherwise what’s the point of canceling our trip."
"I don't think the Japanese government took ""the situation lightly"" but just overwhelmed with the numbers of passengers and crew. The PCR tests will take at least 6 hours. We needed time to make the Institutes to get ready to test all those people. We hope the US with show a better model with the Grand Princess.""Unless CDC level reaches 3"" -- I don't think that will happen. US have nearly the same number now.Some Japanese tested positive after coming back from Hawaii and the other parts of the US. The threat is already in your backyard in California.https://www.latimes.com/california/story/202…My prayers are with the people on Grand Princess and all the people suffering now."
"It took only a few hours for US to overtake Japan. Number of confirmed cases in the US is now 537, vs. 502 in Japan.I suspect the earlier low numbers in the U.S. was just because CDC did not have enough test kits, and performed only about 400 tests up to about a week ago. If they don't test, they don't confirm anything.This is not a good time to travel, even within U.S. One effective way to slow the spread of this virus is to eliminate non-essential travel for a short period of time."
"#944 et al,I've made a major revision to my original post on the Coronavirus situation in Tokyo that is my part of the discussion of facts and informed opinion, expat style. Current state of play? A lot depends on what happens this week, after Abe's expected speech March 10th, and the passing of an emergency powers bill Friday, March 13th. If possible, I wouldn't make any decisions until after those two events.Tokyo Copronavirus 2:0: March 9th. https://medium.com/@aaronpaulson/tokyo-coronavirus-2-0-march-9th-81848b92f992"
I think the decision to travel to Japan is truly a personal one. Only I can make that decision for myself. I am 75 and although in perfect health and very fit I have decided that I will certainly enjoy it more if I wait until next year . I have decided that I do not want to fly anywhere at this point in time as it seems as though many people are bringing this virus to Australia on flights. I will travel around outback Australia and still have an enjoyable holiday.Safe travels to everyone.
"Sounds like a great alternate plan, dianne004500! See you in Japan next year :-)"
Really hoping that Japan can keep the situation under control. Am planning to travel during end April and early May which is also Japan's golden week.
"I hope we'll have.a clearer picture of the procedures tp take effect in ""phase 2"" of the govt's plan to cope with the Coronavirus after Abe's speech tomorrow (Tuesday, Tokyo time) and announcement of new emergency powers on Friday, March 13th.

I have just cancelled my Airbnb and did not manage to get refund as Japan is not listed as one of the destination under COVID-19 special handling. Feeling so disappointed and sad to cancel my first sakura viewing trip (also my first trip to Tokyo).. I hope everything could be better soon. Stay healthy!
"That's too bad, Aiko!This is the relevant passage from Airbnb's Coronavirus information and extenuating circumstances policy:""Other global scenarios that require documentationThe extenuating circumstances policy applies to reservations of all global hosts or guests who must change or cancel travel:In order to comply with disease control restrictions implemented by relevant governmental or health authoritiesIn order to perform medical or disease control duties in connection with the COVID-19 outbreak;As a result of flight or ground transportation cancellations initiated by an airline or ground transportation provider due to the COVID-19 outbreak;In the event that they are diagnosed or suspected of being infected with COVID-19 by a medical or health authority.It looks to me like, if yo are forced to cancel due to circumstances such as flight cancellations due to COVID-19 then you should be covered. If you decide for yourself that your simply not comfortable taking your chances in Japan then yes, it looks like the ""extenuating circumstances"" don't apply to you.Sorry about that :-(For yourself and others who may read this post, I cam gathering a list of Coronavirus-related cancellation policies, etc. at https://medium.com/@aaronpaulson/tokyo-coronavirus-2-0-chapter-8-cancellations-airline-policies-etc-march-9th-46b9af449f43"
"Pretty concerned about it myself - my partner and I are going on March 19th. We're not sure yet of Qantas will cancel our flights (they've reduced services for some BNE-NRT already). We're sad that all the museums we wanted to visit and disney land is closed now (we're assuming the closures will continue, no reason to think otherwise...). We're concerned about them declaring a state of emergency and if that means we'd not be able to get to our different hotels etc too. Some of our hotels have closed the gyms, spas, onsens and restaurants too.We can't cancel without losing a lot of money, even with travel insurance, until our flights get canceled or the government increases its warning level. I also always get sick after flying, so worried about that and we will both most likely need to self-isolate when we get back which we can't afford to do really... but equally, losing a months pay in expenses is crap...Just hoping they don't declare a state of emergency, that we don't get quarantined just because we get dry cough/sniffles after a flight. Bad situation :(Edited: 4:26 am, March 09, 2020 "
I just came across this article from what I think is a NZ based news service:https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2020/03…That rouge scoundrel is certainly not helping the situation!
Anyone know what time Shinzo Abe is delivering his speech tomorrow (Tokyo time) ?We're due to fly on Emirates to Narita (from Amsterdam) tomorrow . Anxious to hear what (possibly) new measures will be deployed. Thanks.
Nurikabe... that’s shocking that they let him just go home after being diagnosed!? But the Japanese guy purposely spreading the corona virus around!? Not as shocking.
"#960 Last time the press conference was after 6pm.I guess the Prime Minister would announce that they made the law of state of emergency and hold on for two more weeks to prevent the speed of spread.I don't think he will declare the state of emergency yet unless it becomes like Italy.The number is going up but many of them are with light symptoms.Edited: 6:10 am, March 09, 2020 "
"Thanks Global. I guess I'll probably find out when I get to Japan . I estimated something similar: extension of the current measures (was secretly hoping for opening of museums next week though). Situation here in europe is getting nastier compared to japan. Well,we'll see....looking forward to be in Japan again after 10 years !"
"I'm surprised how the numbers are increasing in some European countries.Have a nice flight, Eddy. Sakuras will welcome you.Edited: 7:56 am, March 09, 2020 "
"THANK YOU, TokyoAaron2. Extremely helpful. We will be watching with interest March 10 and March 13 before making any final decisions about upcoming April travel."
Cheers leloir! Let's all hope for the best!
"CDC is supposed to post an update on Monday’s, Wednesday’s and Fridays, they’ve been quiet since last Wednesday. I’m surprised that they haven’t placed any restrictions on travel to France, Germany, etc. yet Japan was listed early on. All of Italy is in lockdown now. With over 1000 cases in those countries it’s prone to be community spreading by now. Wish to know what CDC base restrictions on. Sounds as if there’s confusion on how to handle the situation on the global scale at this point. Maybe there will be more clarity by Wednesday."
The CDC is not an international body. They can’t control what other countries are doing and they can only base decisions on the information they receive from other countries.
#967. I was wondering the same thing! Its interesting that France and Germany have exceeded japans numbers but yet japan is still at a level 2.
"CDC is busy handling the situation in the U.S. and asked older people and those with underlying medical condition not to travel. As you probably know, the number of cases in the U.S. have gone up.Here is a page where you can listen to the audio of the CDC briefing from today:https:/…a0309-covid-19-update.html"
"#965 et al,The bill to grant/extend (depends on who you ask) the power to declare a state of emergency passed as expected today. There's two more votes, but both ar econtrolled by Abe's LDP Party and there is no doubt the bill will pass.Two important things to remember:1. just because the bill passes, it does NOT mean that any or all measures will go into effect immediately2. Of the details I have seen, the provisions may greatly affect those already in Japan; HOWEVER it does not appear to have anything to do with banning/quaranting arrivees, etc. I'ce posted an outline of the new bill's provisions as best I've been able to gather at https://medium.com/tokyo-coronavirus/tokyo-c…"
"Sad to say we have cancelled our flights to Japan (booked for April) after almost a year's planning and research. Singapore Airline offered a full refund when we called this morning. (still no refund as of last week)No problem with our hotels as all booked with free cancellation.We'll definitely plan again when the situation returns to normal.Thank you everyone who has contributed to this forum, giving us very useful advice. To those of you who are still going, stay safe !"
Glad you could at least get full refunds Phay... Some people aren’t as lucky in that respect. Hopefully it’ll be better next year. :)
"Looks like although the emergency bill has been made legal, Abe isn't too keen on implementing it just yet. I've been keeping an eye on the numbers and it's worse in Germany, France and Spain so I'm still taking my trip to Japan at the end of March ( if circumstances stay as they are!)"
"@Charly78x not saying you shouldn't go but the real numbers from Japan are expected to be much higher than officially stated. Could easily be 10 times as much. Definitely expect them to be higher than Germany, France, Spain.https:/…index.html"
"Well, the same with the US, who hasn't have enough test kits at many hospitals yet.80 percent will just be like a cold. People with light symptoms work, go to livehouses, and sports gym and we're seeing some clusters. Unless you have chronic diseases, the chance of recovering seems to be quite high: A cold which goes on for ten days or so. Among the ６４６ test positive who were on Diamond Princess、２４５ were discharged."
Deflection as usual. This is a Japan travel forum. Japan is the topic.
Huh?I'm talking about the current situation in Japan.
"Hi PhayCan you explain what you mean about SA offering a full refund? On their website they still say only change of dates is allowed, unless you have tickets that allow full refund.Our tickets state “no refund” in the conditions, so it wouldn’t occur to me to ask SA for a refund. I’m just hoping they’ll change their minds about it, but probably only if things in Japan change a lot soon."
"@rinyvek the same could be said for any country, who knows how many have or have had it and not been tested. All I'm concerned with is how it's affecting travel in Japan right now"
Is there any news about when Museum etc will re open compare to the first statement saying that they will be closed until the 16th of March? Has this date been postponed?
"Today, the Prime Minister requested closure of ten more days.So the majority will be closed till March 19.Samurai Museum at Shinjuku hasn't closed at all and Takarazuka Theater resumed."
"Hi OceanSkyBeach,We booked our flights:1) Penang - Singapore- KIX2) KIX - Singapore- PenangBoth our flights Penang- Singapore and Singapore - Penang have been rescheduled that's the reason we can get a full refund. Another friend who booked her flights from a different place of origin is not entitled to a refund as there's no rescheduling of her flights yet.(We actually realised this only when she called her local SA office)We were offered the refund upon calling our local SA office. We suggest you do the same too to check your booking status."
"Hi PhayThanks for answering so quickly. I wish they would reschedule our flights Brisbane-Singapore-KIX as then we might get a refund. But so far I haven’t received any emails to say so, so I don’t think there’d be any point in me ringing them."

"These are WHO pandemic phase meanings and actions https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/docu…The world WHO regions are defined here, basically country regions likes Asia, Europe, America’s etc https:/…Pandemic can be declared where more than 1-2 countries in a region have an infection spread issue so yes they could have declared earlier. However, reading into what planning and actions can take place by countries it has already been taking place depending on which country and how many infections so official declaration may not be hugely significant for governments. However, travel insurance policies may have reference to it and a trigger point to cover or not cover people for claims so read your policy and assess your situation.Edited: 7:27 pm, March 12, 2020 "
Things are INSANE in the US right now. Honestly I think it’s safer to be in Japan. Americans tend to get very violent when they’re panicked.
“Americans tend to get very violent when they’re panicked.”Huh?
They do seem scary or violent there.
"@khanh-T to be honest, Japans number of cases of the virus are starting to look small in comparison to Europe and the US ( even though the US is a larger country). I'm now starting to worry that Japan won't let us in by the time we travel (UK) as it stands our numbers are increasing steadily"
"@shot here in the UK the Prime minister has said if you feel I'll stay home and no one is being tested so I guess the stats will go down clever move by our government to curtail bad stats but it's getting worse here by the day. I still hold hope that we will come to Japan in two weeks, I am prepared to take the risk of being stranded, I will have to be repatriated if it comes to it but if the travel is still being ok'd i am going"
"@Charly78x: From my personal observation, on regular, without a pandemic going on, Japanese people have higher hygiene standards and practices than many others, so I'd personally feel safer there. I hope you can make your trip! I still don't want to postpone our trip (Mar 31-Apr 13) but my parents are in their late 60s so might not be a wise choice, plus the anxiety of sitting on a plane for 13 hrs (even though the thought of being in a half-empty plane sounds wonderful). My mom really wanted to see cherry blossoms in Japan so this is a big blow for her!Edited: 8:31 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"I wish we could post pictures on here. I could blow your minds. It’s no cleaner here than other places. Foreign teachers know the truths. Public schools are filthy here. Fact. No soap in the bathrooms in many schools. We all talk about it on group chats and on chat boards. Mold and dust everywhere. I have high ceilings in my “new” school and the vents drop clumps of dust and mold on my desk. They’ve not been cleaned in 11 years since the school was built. Facts. There are 1,200 students there. In some schools that have soap, there are soap bars hanging in little mesh bags that have black mold on them because they stay wet and it’s very humid here. The soap bars get all mushy as the wet, moldy mesh bags hold them. There are Facebook threads and Reddit threads about these truths from people who live here. People dispelling the myths. The topic yesterday was about how “99% of Japanese men don’t wash their hands in public bathrooms.” If they do “wash” their hands then it’s a quick little splash of water. These are the facts. People living here see it daily for years and years. A doctor on here claimed that Japanese people are cleaner than Italians, South Koreans and Americans!? Nationalistic garbage. Lies. If anything, the educated Japanese people with open minds and opened eyes ALL have been joking and saying that Japanese people have better immunity to this virus for an historical LACK of hygiene!? They know the truth. A little filth was good for their immunity to this virus is what normal Japanese people are saying. They had dirtier houses than people elsewhere and this built up their immunity. Normal Japanese people don’t cover up the truths. The ones I’m friends with see everything and don’t lie to people in order to keep up some sort of “enchanted forest of perfection” or superiority image. I think Americans are crazy about being hygienic. It’s too much. I was scolded for putting my hands on shopping carts years ago without wiping them first. I was looked at like i was an animal when i put my hands on the railings while standing in line for rides at Disney World in Florida in 2008. I didn’t care. It was at least 15 years ago when friends made fun of me in a DENVER Shopping mall in Cherry Creek... “you still put your hands on the escalator railings?!” I wash my hands when I get home. People are crazy with their antibacterial gels and hand soaps and people here are saying that that could be harming them now. The cool or normal Japanese people are not happy to see South Koreans and Italians suffering. The educated and actually kind Japanese people aren’t pleased to see the death toll rise in the USA. But the sick minded or brainwashed nationalists? They are are. They’re thinking “we are win corona!!!!” Trust the normal or educated Japanese people who are caring and have souls. Not some of the ones on here who keep posting their lies and deflections under the guise of being sweet and helpful sometimes. So happy I know many, many truly helpful Japanese people and I feel bad for the tourists who fall for the fakes who post on here.Edited: 1:28 am, March 15, 2020 "
I disagree entirely. I was out shopping today & while the lines were long no one tried to cut or was disruptive. I am handicapped at present using an electric shopping cart. I was going to leave the store when I saw the long lines but an employee saw I was leaving & asked why. I commented I could not wait that long as I am recuperating from major surgery. She told me to shop & she would authorize me to pay at customer service. This was in BJ warehouse. I was so grateful. I am going to mention this to the GM. Outstanding service. So no all Americans are not going crazy. Most people were not over buying so others could get things also.
I’m glad that’s your experience. I witnessed an elder lady trying to get to the pasta aisle which had only 3 boxes left. Someone else scooped them up before she was able to get there.

My kiddos study abroad trip in June was just cancelled. So sad. I guess I’m not surprised but I was holding out hope.
"clOvely, June is still months ahead. If the numbers decrease in the US and Japan, maybe it will be planned again."
"We were going to come to Japan in the fall for 2-3 weeks but have now put the trip on hold. Thankfully we had not booked anything yet. After this virus is over, we hope to be able to resume our plans. The world economy will be in a steep recession after this and contributing to local economies by spending tourist dollars will greatly help businesses- especially small businesses.Edited: 10:08 am, March 14, 2020 "
Then next year.:-) Usually it's September that terms start in Japan.
"@Shot - The latest from the UK health minister is that ""We have a plan, based on the expertise of world-leading scientists. Herd immunity is not a part of it. That is a scientific concept, not a goal or a strategy."""
Next summer for sure! He could try to go next spring break but that would be a quick trip. This one was supposed to be 4 weeks.
"Unfortunately, I just canceled my trip from March 19-31. We were planning to go but we cannot continue to justify going. The main reason for canceling is because we do not want to get stuck in japan. We can wait to go next spring!!"
A wise move canceling the trip. I know it's a tough decision to cancel after all that planning but better to be safe than sorry. Stay safe everyone! And let's hope this passes quickly without a lot more people dying.

"@Shot,You are right. We won't get a vaccine to the virus, and we won't be able to have the Olympic, at least this year. But, I still believe that Japanese Government will approve the drug (Favipiravir) which can cure the pneumonia and save the life of those patients soon, which can change the pessimistic atmosphere. Also, Gilead Science will finish the ongoing Phase III trial of Remdesivir in Early April in China, which I hope can prevent the progression of asymptomatic patients to pneumonia. Then, NIKKEI and Dow Jones will go up again. I hope Remdesivir to be approved not only in China and the U.S.A. but also in Japan in the future, although we don't know when it will be."
"Unless there are no new cases anywhere by mid-May, I think to host the Olympics in July will not be a smart move. I don't think the Japanese medical system will be able to handle the load from exposure from all these foreign visitors. Many of them may be asymptomatic.Japan will lose some money if the Olympics is cancelled or postponed, I know, but that may prevent a bigger loss - both monetary as well as human lives."
"Just curious what is the current situation in the Tokyo area regarding food shops, department stores, trains, etc?Are the numbers dwindling out there or they are closing or re-opening stores?"
"Department stores start a little later, and shortening their opening hours but they are open. Many people are staying at home than going out to prevent the spread so the sales are dropping seriously.Some trains are less crowded. Less serious than Paris or Italy so far.About the Olympics, PM and the Mayor of Tokyo won't mention postponement, but the Polls are saying that more than half of the Japanese are waiting for the WHO or IOC to make suggestions of putting it off.Edited: 12:15 am, March 17, 2020 "
"GraceK, ""Just curious what is the current situation in the Tokyo area regarding food shops, department stores, trains, etc?""Here's another thread about the current situation. Commuter trains are all running as always. Shinkansen and other long distance trains have had major impact in lack of passengers. They've cut back on the number of trains. Airlines have also cut back, domestically as well as internationally. It's hard to be a tourist when countries have closed their borders. Japan has not. Just self quarantine for 2 weeks for those coming from China and South Korea. But things change daily.

Can you update the information here tomorrow please?I really don't want to cancel thank you
FCO is advising against non essential travel... I was supposed to fly on Thursday but I am cancelling everything and moving everything to Autumn.. My main concern is getting stuck in Japan or during my layover as all the borders are shutting down.
"Yes, I will once I find the announcement tomorrow.It is 8 pm in Japan, so I will update within 24 hours. US is not included in tomorrow's list yet."
"I think by now it is evident that even if some want to go, they cannot as the borders are closed. the reduced frequency of comments show that here."
Japan will lose $50 BILLION if the Olympics is cancelled. It's all about money. COVID-19 doesn't care.

"We were supposed to leave yesterday early in the morning and as soon as I woke up to get ready I received a text from the airline that the return flight was cancelled. Rest of the connecting flights was ok.We were about to leave in an hour and all was set, it's a good thing we found out before everything started rolling. We can still find return flights but very expensive and the airlines and governments can stop flights at any given moment.If any Japan traveller out there still wants to go, it's just too many variables right now. Please keep that in mind. We are working with the airlines for the refund and Alaska was very gracious to give us couple hundred dollars voucher for future trip.Also I was trying to cancel/change our trip few days earlier and I spent literally 6-7 hrs on the phone waiting for a travel agent, so if you want to cancel or change your trip schedules give yourself some lead time to make arrangements.God bless to all!Edited: 8:06 pm, March 19, 2020 "
Bummed out we missed the Sakura though...but oh well everything works together for good....
Politico wrote that President Trump would raise the level to 4 soon. Maybe that's why you got your return flight cancelled.You can see sakura at the Japanese gardens at Seattle etc. too.
"""We are working with the airlines for the refund and Alaska was very gracious to give us couple hundred dollars voucher for future trip.""Well that is good to hear. I still see lots of flights from U.S to Tokyo planned in the coming days. I suspect by April 1 these flights will all be grounded internationally."
"Actually the Singapore government will halt flights from NRT to US in about 2-3 days per website. And yes Pres. Trump raised warning to Level 4. Basically saying US citizens should start going back home or risk of getting stranded which is not good. We can still go if we catch different airline on the return flight to the US, but we took it as a sign not to go for now and it FELT really good.We actually had everything ready and about to start the trek, but literally decided against going to Japan at the last 30mins.Within the city limits we sparsely have cherry blossoms here too, but kids waiting several months for this trip, but they are over it now. We will try again in the summer hopefully things will improve quite a bit.Alaska airlines was so nice, they called us back when they said they would within 6-10 mins. I was surprised by their customer service. Our refund should come from SGP airlines, but Alaska still gave us about $800 worth of vouchers for future trip for the inconvenience.I wish everybody well and hopefully we will all get through these things, especially the elderly and the needy.

"The outbreak of this infection seems to be ended in China in @3 months. But, will it end in the rest of the world in @3 months? We cannot see any sign for this so far. I don't want to say this, but unfortunately we might have to learn more from China how to end this infection, although we cannot learn any communistic ways.The most scientific way is to have an effective drug ASAP, but unfortunately there are problems to have those weapons for this, and we might have to battle without effective weapons now."

"＠kobekeith,I wonder if the Sri Lankan worker you introduced meet the criteria for PCR testing of the Covit-19 in Japan. Although he/she had fever for some days, he/she does not have other symptoms suggestive of pneumonia: dehydration and nausea are not the symptoms of pneumonia. Also, I assume he/she received chest X-ray but does not seem to be diagnosed as pneumonia. Also, didn't he/she had miscommunication with Japanese? The Japanese who told with him/her should have explained the current criteria of PCR testing for Covit-19 in Japan, such as fever more than 37.5 Celsius degree for 4 consecutive days or pneumonia, etc., but probably could not tell them in English. It was indeed a problem that officials who decide the PCR testing did not easily allow it in Japan last month, but not in this month. Japanese Government has recently decided to only hospitalize pneumonia patients, and return non-pneumonia patients to home, because of recent increase in infected people. So, if he/she had been tested PCR and was positive, he/she would return home without pneumonia. I think Japan is doing well so far to keep hospitals available to severe patients who need to be hospitalized."
"Hi Global. It's everywhere.

The Govenor of New York was saying the same thing.You really have to wonder where this will all end up.If your a doctor, nurse, orderly, cleaner etc in a hospital it's just a matter of time till your infected.

There is plenty of pasta, rice, flour and different meat cuts, as much vegetables and fruit needed no shortage, saw many items today in an inner central city shop where I live, though items are restricted to buying no more than 1-3 items at a time.

"Thought this might be a useful model to see for some https://covidactnow.org/state/FL. I do wish stricter measures would be taken by local government before the situation turns dire like the poor people of Italy are experiencing now. Why wait, look what happens when countries, states and cities wait for a situation to get bad in their area before placing more strict regulations. Consider the time it takes from the moment these regulations are placed to the point people actually take them seriously. There are still people in my community who brush this off as a flu, very frustrating to see this. Since early February been keeping up to date and it appears South Korea has been proactive from the beginning all around compared to the rest of the world. The most shocking was the number of testing available and people tested vs. just looking at actual positive cases; that paints a clear picture in terms of how proactive and prepared each country is."
