I have not been to the island in about 2 years and at that time the island had been coming back from the aftermath of the hurricane. Can anyone tell me their opinion on how the island is repairing? Also what is the status of the hospital as it had taken a bad hit and most of the doctors etc had left the island. Is the island's health care back to pre-hurricane.

We are totally recovered from the 2017 hurricanes and the only resorts still not open on St Thomas are the Frenchman's Reef (scheduled to reopen in the next few months) and the Sugar Bay Resort whose reopening remains enigmatic but which property has way more issues than hurricane damage.
"Bluebeards Beach Club is not open yet, and the timeshares at Elysian are still being renovated. The Beach Club is going to be renamed but don't recall the new name. Bluebeards Castle partially open, separate resort from the Beach Club, no restaurants open yet."
"Bluebeards Beach Club has reverted to its familiar beach name and is now the Limetree Beach Resort. It is reopening May 2, 2020.The 39 privately owned units at Elysian have been open for some time now and the Wyndham-owned units are scheduled to reopen the last quarter of this year.Edited: 8:43 am, February 26, 2020 "
Can you also provide an update on the health care system? I know the hospital took a big hit and many of the doctors left the island. Is the hospital back up to the former Island standard?
"If you are concerned about health care, buy trip insurance that covers medical evacuation. Knock on wood, we haven't needed to use it. We've made 4 trips since Irmaria. I'd say the level of care is back to what it was before the storms.Edited: 9:01 am, February 27, 2020 "
"We've been here for 5 days now, and I can't address the hospital (thank goodness) but aside from several buildings and homes which are still undergoing renovations the island and beaches are beautiful! Weather is perfect, and the biggest problem is deciding which beach to hit today and where to eat tonight!"
Any sign of the Coronavirus
No there is not.
