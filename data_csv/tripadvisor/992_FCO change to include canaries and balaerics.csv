"I see the FCO have changed the info to include the Canaries and Balaerics in the ""all but essential travel"" part.What happens now?Seems like the hope was they would remove it from the quarantine, but they have went the other way.."
"Yes, Dominic Raab took advantage of Grant thingys absence in Spain to do this.Still current at: 27 July 2020 Updated: 27 July 2020 Latest update:FCO advice against all non-essential travel to Spain now applies to the whole country, including the Balearic and Canary Islands ('Summary' page)From 27 July, the FCO advise against all non-essential travel to Spain, including the Balearic and Canary Islands, based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks in the country.This advice is based on evidence of increases in cases of COVID-19 in several regions, but particularly in Aragon, Navarra and Catalonia (which include the cities of Zaragoza, Pamplona and Barcelona)."
I see you joined TripAdvisor just to slate people who are looking to travel?Actively joined a travel based website for this reason?Cool
"Oh dear. Whilst I totally understand what the government is doing (damned if they do and damned if they don’t), it must be the worst nightmare for the holiday industry. To a degree I agree with CS. At erratic times like this, wouldn’t it be easier to cancel abroad 2020 holidays?But then would we have holiday resorts and businesses to return to? So many companies going bust. Where do we draw the line?My heart goes out to people waiting to go on holiday to find out it’s cancelled."
"MiDzIE, I agree. Although I don’t feel comfortable enough to travel abroad any time soon, I do feel for those who were working towards and hoping to have the quarantine on return from the islands to the UK lifted, only to be hit with essential travel only. It seemed to come out of left field. I’m thinking that the amount of tourists from mainland Spain visiting the islands was a factor in this. Chin up, folks, and stay safe.Edited: 2:37 pm, July 27, 2020 "
I was due to fly to Gran canaria next mondayTui sent an e mail saying we could cancel and rebook another time or elsewhere . But they have to contact us to give a refund code and no doubt they are working their way through the long list.Trouble is there are places to book but by the time I speak to them the prices for elsewhere will have rocketed. Also the way things are going what chance other destinations will go off the radar
There is very little logic to this decision and I really feel for those who have holidays booked.
Me too. I suppose to be extra safe is the right decision. The government was criticised for not locking down soon enough in March. I suppose they are learning from that lesson. But then they will be knocked down by this decision. They can’t win.
"#6 TUI are impossible to get through to at the moment. We have a holiday booked to Skiathos in early September and we know for a fact the hotel is closed. TUI are insisting everything is just fine and won't respond further which is very frustrating! As you have mentioned, all the time other holidays are increasing and we can't do a thing until we know if our holiday is going ahead at an alternative hotel or is going to be a last minute cancellation. Very frustrating, but I suppose worse things happening in the world right now."
"LancasterI think Tui have had ""more pressing"" things to worry about today like people who were going on holiday this week. Chances are providing your flight goes ahead i September if your hotel is closed then you will either get a refund or offered another hotel either the same or better standardI know that there has been a lot of coverage of Spanish people going to the islands from the mainland for their holidays in August. Assuming the Spanish government were not intending to stop these travellers then maybe our government foresee a spike coming in the next few weeks"
I am due to travel to Gran Canaria on the 9th August and am still planning to do so. Unless they cancel the flights there is no way they can stop me going is there..? GOV.UK says it 'ADVISES' you not to trvel. They are not saying you cannot travel are they..?
Correct. But how do you plan on getting there and furthermore you will have no travel insurance.I doubt the airlines will fly if there is a FCO restriction in place.
I already have flights booked and as per GOV.UK it says it advises against travel not that you cant go.Airlines havent said flights are cancelled yet so assuming we can still fly...
Why are you flying with?
Airlines are flying because some people’s travel is essential - eg those returning to Spain who live there or business travel etc Holidays are 100% not essential which is why packages were cancelled immediately Don’t take the fact that flights are going as the green light - they’re going to facilitate the travel for whom it is essential
Why anyone would travel without insurance is beyond me Going against fco advice invalidates all policies inc all the new Covid policies
"I spoke to TUI this morning and was advised my holiday on the 5th Set is going ahead as planned, and I was not able to cancel or change to a different destination right now. They have prioritized holidays leaving before the 9th August. If the FCO guidelines don't change they will contact me to offer a refund or another destination but not before the 22nd August. I guess they are doing it in two week chunks."
Not all policies Battleface will cover you for medical expenses regardless of FCO advise is about £100 for family of 4
it will but just looked at their small print (cos my dad was looking for one!) and even that lists that nothing is covered if its 'as a consequence of covid' so yes it doesn't cover covid as you know but it also doesn't cover anything that can be linked to covid in any way and as a policy they have more exclusions than inclusions
"9th Aug Out - Ryanair 17th Aug back - EasyJetEdited: 9:35 am, July 29, 2020 "
