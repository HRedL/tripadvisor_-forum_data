"It’s a wholly personal decision- some people are planning to continue with their trips, at least for the time being, whilst others are cancelling.I’m not saying that either approach is right to wrong - each individual has to make whatever decision they see fit"
"No one can tell you what else might close in the coming weeks and months. You'll just have to monitor the news like everyone else.I wouldn't risk it at this point, I know that and I have flown to Los Angeles twice and Las Vegas once in the past 6 weeks. If I would have known the extent of what's happening with the virus, I would not have gone either time (except the last trip was for a funeral).13"

"If it were May I'd say wait and see, but for April I'd cancel. Personal health and those around you if the first consideration. The second is that it now seems all but certain there will be many closings occurring soon. And when the first hotel/casino gets it, and one will, things will accelerate even further.Vegas has 4 confirmed cases. To get you a timeline, NY had three last week. Today we have 190 and expect that to double in a few days. Syracuse U and Cornell are closing campuses to name a few. There are subway and train closures, an entire section of New Rochelle is on lockdown. Again this is just one week after we had 3 cases. This awaits Vegas and everywhere else. Cancel, next 6-8 weeks are gonna be rough."
Cancel your trip. Wait a few months and see what happens here.
"If we made a list of items or attractions closed in LV, it would probably be out of date before the end of the day. And would be very hard to keep up to date.Only you can decide if Vegas is still a place you want to visit, with all of the changes taking place."
I canceled but not because of the virus but because of a new job and finances. I guess I don't watch the news so I do not get the same fear that people are getting from this new virus. What research I have done says more people have died from the flu than this.
Yes.
"Again, comparing the flu to COVID-19 is meaningless. The flu has saturated the population for hundreds of years. COVID-19 one month. Flu has a vaccine, this does not.The concern is that COVID-19 is highly contagious and we need to slow it's spread. It's impact now is tiny, that is correct. But if COVID-19 ever gains even a fraction of exposure in the populace the death toll would be over a million. Will that happen? Not likely, but it illustrates how it is far far deadlier than the flu.Edited: 1:12 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"Upstate, some people have knocked you here, but to me you have spoken clearly and rationally."
"Thank you. I'm not here demanding people do one thing or another, but the single most important thing to do is to know the facts. The amount of willful ignorance on display on this site is distressing."
Only you can answer that.
"It's a fact that nobody knows the mortality rate of this virus. Experts think that any current estimates about mortality rate will go way down as data is collected because most people who get it have mild symptoms, dismiss it as a cold, and don't report it. It's also a fact that elderly and immunocompromised individuals are at a higher risk to develop severe symptoms than other populations. It's willfully ignorant to ignore any of those facts that don't feed the current hysteria.It's a personal decision based on looking at the facts I listed above, among many more.Edited: 2:33 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"The mortality rate going down because it turns out it is far easier to get it is not good news. While yes, being asymptomatic is good if you are one of them, it only endangers high risk people even more. I have zero concerns for myself, I'm 40 with a healthy immune system. It's about the 70 or so million who are at risk."
I’m 30 and have a trip planned two weeks from today for my Bachelor Party. We are all within the 25-35 age range and will be going unless either the hotels or airlines shut down.
"It is a personal decision and I have a trip planned in April which I am still planning on.Should things change, we will adjust our plans.I am from NY as well, and New Rochelle is not on lockdown. There is a one mile parameter of ""containment"" and the National Guard will be there to assist with sanitizing, bringing in groceries, etc.""""We are not containing people,"" Cuomo said. ""We are containing facilities."":"
"Totally up to you. Those affected the most are the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. They are primarily the ones that will fall victim. I guess, it doesn't scare me a whole lot. Be safe, do whatever you please. I am going to LV in 2 days"
I took a middle approach booking the hotel but holding off on the airlines but my trip isn't till Oct.
