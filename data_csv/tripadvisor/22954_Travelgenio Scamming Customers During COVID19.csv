"Anyone had any experience with Travelgenio lately?I booked two flights with them which were due to fly out on 06/04/20 and 10/04/20. First flight cost in excess of £844 and second flight around £734.For a while I have been requesting for a refund and I kept getting told that they have received my email and they will get back to me 72 hours before my flight.After nor hearing anything from Travelgenio I decided to contact them again yesterday (04/04/20) only to receive a disturbing email from them telling me I have a pay a fine of roughly €600 per person. The reason for this is aparantly because my flight is confirmed. However Airindia have announced on Twitter that they have cancelled all flights till 14th April. Also, when I check my booking on their website I can see that my outgoing flight is no longer there. Aswell as this, the government of India is not allowing any tourist to enter the country. Other agencies have seen the cancellations and are giving full refunds. And I'm making this up, my cousins and parents booked with Budget air, who emailed them informing them that due to flight cancellations they will refund the flight. So why is Travelgenio not doing the same???Travelgenio are clearly trying to pull a fast one on me and because of how short notice they have given me I.e my flight being due to fly tomorrow, is trying to push me to accept their fine. Absolutely disgusting!Someone please advise what the best thing to do is as I feel like I am being Royaly Scammed."

"-> Anyone had any experience with Travelgenio lately?Only the scores of other unfortunates littering this forum.->only to receive a disturbing email from them telling me I have a pay a fine of roughly €600 per personNope, it'll be a fee to which you agreed when entering into a contract->Other agencies have seen the cancellations and are giving full refundsSome good ones may be. The ones of type you used are passing on what they get minus aforementioned fees.-> Someone please advise what the best thing to do is as I feel like I am being Royaly ScammedNo, you're really not. Your request for advice comes at the wrong end of the transaction."
"I think you've misunderstood the OP's issue. The flight is cancelled but Travelgenio claims it is operating, hence they won't refund in full."
"If airline have cancelled the flight and Travelgenio say otherwise, I'd suggest speaking with your credit card provider. They may be able to assist."
"Travelgenio are suggesting that my flight is still confirmed. But they are not, the flight from the airliner is cancelled."
"Hello Roswald. To review your case in detail, please could you write to us customer.service@travelgenio.com at with all the details, so we can check what happened?. We look forward to hearing from you. Regards.INFORMATION REGARDING COVID-19 (CORONAVIRUS)…travelgenio.com/pages-information-regarding…"
"Hello,@Travelgenioi have bought one ticket from your agency and my flight was canceled I have contacted your company many times but no one answered. can you help me? what should i do???? the airline told me that the flight was canceled for a full refund.I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.Edited: 11:41 am, April 06, 2020 "
You'll get the same answer posted immediately above your post.
"Hi Salar, Due to the number of requests received by mail and call center, our response times have increased. Our agents try to prioritize based on flight schedules, but receiving duplicate emails will not help us speed up the process. Our agents will contact you as soon as possible. over the next few days. cordially"
"Hi,I really appreciate your prompt reply. Actually I have contacted them 15 days ago. during this period I didn't receive any confirmation and I can't see anything on my account on your website. So, how can I be sure they will be contacting me later?"
"salar, Travelgenio have been worse than usual about customer service in the last month or so. It's doubtful anyone will contact you about your cancelled flight.'what should i do???? the airline told me that the flight was canceled for a full refund.' If as you say the airline cancelled the flight and are willing to refund your fare, what I would do is stop trying to contact Travelgenio but would speak to my credit card issuer and let them deal with this awful operation.Travelgenio will need to obtain a refund from the airline, and they will charge a fee to process the refund, but let the bank sort it out rather than you trying to do so. The replies here are made by a bot, not staff from Travelgenio."
Because all online forms when submitted are registered. We are now prioritizing flighs in next 72 hours. Regards
Go ahead and dispute with your bank. The facts are on your side. Good luck!
@Travelgenio
"TP is right. Travelgenio have been saying for some time that they are only dealing with those due to fly in the next three days. If that's not the case, then there's no point in trying to communicate with them.It makes sense to let your card provider try and sort it out, but keep your expectations as to how long it will take realistic."
"Dear All,@Travelgenioyes the Aeroflot told me that my flight was canceled and i will receive a full refund. but as you mention no one is answered in Travelgenio agency. so how can i solve the problem with my bank? what should I do exactly? can anybody give advice or have the same experience?Thank you"
"'so how can i solve the problem with my bank? what should I do exactly?' I would call my credit card issuer and tell them that I'd booked through Travelgenio but that Aeroflot were offering a refund.I'd have all the information in place before caling the bank - the Aeroflot PNR (passenger name record or confirmation code or locator code), flight number and dates, and the ticket number if available (it's 12 digits and will start with 555- if booked with Aeroflot).I'd also have the date I asksed Travelgenio to make the booking and their confirmation email available with their confirmation information. I'd tell the bank I was unable to reach Travelgenio and would appreciate their help in getting a refund from them, and I'd tell the bank that I'd expect to pay the Travelgenio fee for processing the refund.What you do is your choice."
"Hi all,i have asked my bank to follow up on my request from Travelgenio and solve the problem. today i have received an email from Travelgenio that I should close my dispute. otherwise they are sending back my money.can you give me any advice? what should I do? i should wait for the my back or trust on them?i cant trust on them at all."
"We would like to study your case. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, indicating the Booking ID (8-digit code) in the subject line. Remember to use the e-mail address you used to make your reservation. You will immediately receive instructions"
We have 100+ threads here about them.Do not trust them
"solar, I agree with N_T. Don't trust them. Don't do anything until they have either refunded you, or your bank has sorted it out for you."
"This seems to be the status quo. I had flights cancelled by the airline but received nothing from them on the cancellation, and the only contact inhale had from them is the generic blurb on send us your 8 digit reference number blah blah blah."
"That's a LIE, there is NO contact made in the 72 hours before the flight. You are scammers and thieves.Edited: 6:15 am, May 25, 2020 "
Never blame to thievery what can be blamed on incompetence.
"“You are scammers and thieves”No, we aren’t. This is the public forum of Trip advisor and most of us are travellers trying to share advice based on our own knowledge and experience."
"RTorgius, We have informed you previously how to contact us to register your petition. Once done as you say, our agents will contact you as soon as the actual situation allows. Due to the actual amount of petitions, reply times have increased. Thanks"
exactly we share our experience to find a solution.
"Any news on your contact with TG, solar?"
"Unfortunately, not :(when I ask them to clarify for me when exactly they will refund my money and how much exactly. they stop answering me. I'm wating for my bank answer."
"we must follow airline procedures and this can take some time without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline approves the refund, from Travelgenio we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase."
You know I can't accept this kind of excuse. I have bought thicket from other agencies and got a full refund one month ago! it's not acceptable at all. you should provide correct information for your customer.
"they don't have the manpower to answer individual customersHad you done 2 minutes of research before giving them your money you wouldn't be here today. They absolutely are to blame, but you need to do better work before giving your money to internet randoms, especially when their shortcomings are so well documented"
"I agree it's not acceptable. But they don't care what you or I think. They know there's plenty more people waiting to hand them money because they like an advertised price that in all likelihood isn't even achievable.And they aren't alone in being useless. Either you used more reputable companies when you had refunds within a month, or you were extremely lucky."
"Salar - just because you bought tickets from another OTA and they have handled your claim through them more efficiently means absolutely nothing - if TG are processing the refund , sadly it will take as long as it takesYOU and you alone are responsible for choosing to use a company which is not well known for speedy and efficient customer service at the best of times, so in the current pandemic they are naturally going to be overloaded and that means additional delays.  BTW - I hope you are not expecting to get ALL your money back eventually . The booking service fees are non refundable and there will be further charges for handling the cancellation (check their website for precise amounts)Edited: 5:42 am, May 26, 2020 "
"Dear All,i really appreciate to help me. you are right i can't compare the companies. what is your advice for me? trust on TG or waiting for my bank answer?"
Don’t trust TG.File dispute with your credit card.TG has three positive posts here this year and over ten thousand negative comments.Dispute and move on.
"Salar- by all means see if your bank can do something for you. Perhaps they can, although I suspect Travelgenio’s terms and conditions will stop them. Still, nothing ventured nothing gained. Otherwise, yes. Wait for TG and see what happens. You must be very, very, VERY patient. They are incompetent in the best of times and will 100x worse now. Still, if you persevere you could have some success."
"Ben is right that it doesn't hurt to ask your bank/card provider. But they might well be very busy with similar requests, so I wouldn't expect to necessarily get a reply quickly.You never know, though, maybe it will make things happen a bit quicker than they would otherwise."
your bank may not help if the only reason that the claim is not proceeding is that Salar is refusing to pay the agreed processing fee to do it . He is not going to be able to bypass his obligations to pay them what he owes according to the contract he entered into
"Yes, I agree that there may be no help forthcoming. Which is why I'd try it and then forget all about and get on with my life until I get a yes or a no back. If it's a no then that's that :-)"
