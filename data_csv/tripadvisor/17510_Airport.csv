"I have a trip planned and if flights are still running, flying out Saturday. My question is how much time should I allow for check in process? With the virus epidemic does it take longer through TSA?"
"The few anecdotes I've heard indicate that TSA isn't doing anything particularly special as far as screening. Considering almost nobody is flying, that has added up to minimal wait times at TSA checkpoints. If it were me, I'd arrive when I normally would. Safe travels!"
There is not much posted right now on the Lambert Airport website.https:/â€¦coronavirus-covid-19-update
