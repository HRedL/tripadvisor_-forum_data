Are people social distancing and wearing masks in restaurants and public places? Are seating capacities less at restaurants to allow for social distancing?
"If you are concerned about coronavirus, don't come to SC. The rate is increasing, one of the highest spikes in the nation, and there is no statewide mask order. People are not wearing them."
Can’t speak much the claim above as one of the highest spike n the nation EXCEPT have read that in the past 3 weeks testing was increased dramatically My family and I were there over the long Memorial Day Weekend and frankly little or no mask wearing was seen only time saw some worker’s and shoppers wearing masks were in the stores Publix and IGA Beach at 6th N Ave was fine with adequate spacing Not knowing where you are staying have to say in front of most of the big resorts Ashworth Avista beach was packed We brought most supplies from home including food and grilled at our complex Most favorite places had lines and crowds waiting Went out one night for dinner at the new bar19Twelve Sat outside socially spaced and had a wonderful meal I would just suggest be smart be prepared and enjoy!
The data shows spike.https:/…
"It's time to think about recirculating air thru A/C systems in a hot climate. Remember cruise ships? The ducts and filters are fetid, no matter how many Clorox wipes on the doorknobs."
"I returned home today from 8 days in North Myrtle, and can only tell you my experience. We found several places not even close to following guidelines. Some places masks were non-exsistent and some were better than others. Walmart was actually pretty good when we went to pick up basics. We spent most of our time in NMB except for some golf courses within the strand. Our first place we went to on arrival the outside was full so they asked us to have a drink at the bar. The bar was elbow to elbow, so we turned around and left. Had this experience at 2 other places as well. We did find some well distanced places as well at least Trying to abide by the guidelines. There seems to be a good percentage of the population who thinks masks and distancing makes you weak. We stayed at the condo more than we planned for but kept busy doing some upgrades. Cases were up quite a bit from last week until today. Also 4 well known restaurants closed in the last few days and I expect more to come. We did golf quite a bit an felt comfortable on every course we played."
"We made reservations for the Westgate in NMB before learning that NMB is a hotspot. We're scheduled to check in tomorrow, 06/27. Does anyone know if the lack of mask-wearing and social distancing is still continuing now ? I have been very, very diligent in trying to follow the CDC guidelines because not only are my husband and I in the susceptible group, but I take care of my elderly parents who have lung and heart issues. I'm very nervous about going to NMB."
"You should be concerned. SC is still spiking and some states are requiring quarantines for people coming from several states, including SC."
"ShawnandVicky,Nobody on here can tell you what to do.They can only tell you what conditions are there right now.You can compare the rate of infection there with Georgia and any other state here:https://rt.live/You can see what people are posting.Numerous states, including Virginia, are requiring residents returning from SC vacations to self-quarantine for 14 days.I would plan to do the same if you insist on coming.Only you can answer the question if that is something you can do, given your particular set of responsibilities.Perhaps instead of asking us here you should ask your family doctor if he/she recommends you travel to the Grand Strand right now."

"Pretty stressful here. Most people all up and down the beach are not following the CDC Guidelines. Very few using face masks and not giving each other 6' or more of distancing. There seems to be a bizarre attitude like we are on vacation, the virus is only a problem back home? Especially terrible trying to use the elevators and going into any businesses that don't have CDC guidelines in full force."

Rick where did you play? Heading down next week and have a time set up at Barefoots Dye course. First time heading to NMB. We’re greens Aerified?
J.R. M...look at this post....https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g54359…
"My condo is in Barefoot and we didn’t play the Dye this time but Norman and Fazio were in good shape. Looks like Dye was scheduled Jun 19th so should be good there. This link should be a big help.https:/…Also played Tidewater (awesome). Legends Heathland and Parkland. Oyster bay, surpringly good shape besides horrendous cartpaths and greens are veryyyy slow And Willbrook, a good solid course in Pawleys.Edited: 4:58 pm, July 05, 2020 "
I am here now. There seems to be little regard for the virus. It is clear to me why this is a hot spot and likely will not change. If I could have gotten a refund on my house rental I would not have come.
I will reply to my own post after returning from about 10 days at the beach. I agree with those who say that it seems like people think they are on vacation from the virus. Masking did get better after the ordinance passed requiring masks but still saw plenty of people without them. Even some restaurants without staff wearing them or wearing them around their chins. I think it is possible to be smart and safe but there are plenty of people who seem to think all the safety measures are not needed.
"k4la, we live in Medina, Ohio and are planning to go to NMB at the end of August. We’re bringing our own food and only getting carry out or delivery. We also stay at a smaller condo building on the beach so it’s not totally crowded. I hate that managers in restaurants aren’t making their employees follow the rules. I hate to be a negative Nancy but if I went into a restaurant and people weren’t wearing masks or had them around their chins, I would call and report them. You’re never going to stop the spread of this virus if you don’t cover your face. I’m so sick of locals trying to blame all of the infections on tourists. I’ve read soooooo many posts of locals not covering their faces or social distancing!!"
"We just returned earlier this evening from a long weekend. I can tell you that people are definitely not taking this virus seriously. We saw so many more people without a mask then we did with a mask. And social distancing? Forget about it! Yes, it’s true that even employees at restaurants and stores are not wearing a mask. This will definitely be our last getaway to the beach for a long time."
