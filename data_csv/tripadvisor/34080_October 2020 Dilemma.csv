The flights are out and good prices..property rentals are being advertised though some seem to have a 3 tier price option...no refund /some refund but dearer) /double the price but full refund...insurance companies so I believe will have a clause if holiday cancelled due to cCV19 they won't pay out.My dilemma.....do we risk booking?..Or wait and see if there is a last minute deal but obviously may not get anything because everyone booked earlier! Do you think Crete will be allowing UK Citizens to visit by October...?
"Strictly my own personal opinion and I respect everyones will be different, after speaking to friends who own hotels and tavernas on Crete then I don't think UK citizens will be visiting this year, however if the flights are cheap enough to throw away if not used may be worth a chance as you can always pick up some accommodation in October if you are flexible, insurance is another matter, I am sure other nationalities further down the recovery road will be allowed to visit."
Is it about getting a deal or about a good safe and fun worry free vacation?A vacation should be worry free and safe with all of the amenities open and interaction with others. Also note that present will be people from all over the world if everything is open. Greece will be there next year and the year after.If all you are after is a good deal then go for it.
we tend to do self catering and are looking for a quiet relaxing break...don't interact as such ..meals out sometimes...we know Crete quite well been several times so not going to tourist hot spots more ambling around walks relaxing by a villa pool....
"Personally, I would hold off until you know for sure that flights will be operating.Some international flights should start in July to/from Crete, but it is highly likely not to include the UK, no one knows yet when you will be able travel from Britain, nor whether you can be insured; I can't imagine people wanting to risk it without health insurance.There will be plenty of accommodation available, that is surely not going to be in any shortage this year, there may only be 10-20% occupancy rates expected, & so there will be offers.Edited: 11:24 am, May 18, 2020 "
"Wait, if it is possible to travel - pay the full price they are asking for and - let finally EVERYONE forgets about cheap holidays! The cheapest solution is - stay home. If someone doesn't like it - Plymouth Bournemouth Portsmouth... whichever “mouth” you choose that's - it.Whoever tells you otherwise is either an incorrigible romantic or - deceives you.Edited: 1:50 pm, May 18, 2020 "
"Shall British authorities allow you to fly?Shall Greek authorities allow you to holiday?What the price of your health travel insurance will be?Times when health travel insurance was considered negligible spending might well be long gone for all of us.I wouldn’t rush booking if in your shoes.Yuri.Edited: 3:33 pm, May 18, 2020 "
"Doreen. We're booked forSept 17th and are keeping fingers crossed. Tui still say theyre resuming flights on June 17th, so if that transpires and Crete will have us, we'll be going.Bonjours. Greece will no doubt be there next year and the year after. We may not be!!!"
Ps. We booked and got insurance pre covid
"@DoreenHow much budget do you have in mind for that?I mean, a villa with self catering and a pool?"
"Hi Doreen. There are times in life when it’s ok to act on impulse. In my mind, this most certainly isn’t one of them. Covid-19 is such an unknown quantity. No matter where you stay, villa or whatever, you’ll be sitting on a plane for four hours or more to get to Crete. Do you really want to put yourself in that situation? I think it would be sensible to wait for the situation to become much clearer before even considering booking anything for this year. Stay home and stay safe.Edited: 6:07 pm, May 18, 2020 "
The Greek Tourism Minister said in an interview on BBC radio last night that UK citizens would be welcome in Greece this year - his recommendation when asked was Astypalea (maybe someone should warn them!). Of course this doesn’t mean there won’t be other obstacles that may stop us travelling.
Ntragkon....Not sure why my budget is relevent lol. We obv have a budget and have regularly stayed in Crete and other Greek islands always out of main season and have done our homework on prices now. My uncertainty is wether Crete will be open for UK Citizens....maggie m......I have my fingers crossed your holiday goes ahead...and your remark about Greece being there next year but we might not be....I feel much the same...I so want to visit Crete but I am going to hold fire and pray I will be about next year!!!
"The only safe answer to this type of question is Yes/No/Maybe* *Delete as applicable. Many of us hope to be able to travel, but nobody can actually say whether or not we will be allowed to, or if other obstacles e.g. quarantine, will make it impractical."
"It's so difficult. I convince myself that we've given up on this year and truthfully all I really want is the freedom to move around here and see family and friends. Then a thought or memory comes up, or we'll look at a photo, and the call of Crete is hard to resist. We are booked to go in around 12 weeks and it's hard to imagine things being relaxed enough in that time to make getting there easy or enjoyable.All this has taken away the enjoyment of planning and anticipation...a huge part of the holidays for me"
We arent visiting Crete but Athens in late October having postponed our March 2020 visit.I am being positive. October is 5 months away so plenty of time for things to happen.
"My personal opinion would be not to book, we have flights booked for October and I don’t think we’ll be going to Crete this year.....and even if flights are operating from the UK you have to think would you feel comfortable flying ? I know I wouldn’t having had to fly back from the Caribbean on 14 March....it wasn’t a very pleasant experience. ...and that was before social distancing"
Fingers crossed you make it to Athens bronia :-)
"Gillian058 Dont worry its the anticipation thats making it hard We were supposed to be in Crete now. Once you accept you cant go you get over it very quickly . It does not help when relatives from Crete and Athens send you photos .That is another story LOL MG100surrey you make an excellent and informed point that many of us really do not consider about. Being on the plane with hundreds of others and the problems that may cause.We hear that breathing the air on the aircraft is safe etc. Ok but you are not in the air all the time.Edited: 6:05 am, May 19, 2020 "
We flew in March and April and to be honest it felt safer than going to our local supermarket when we got home.
Thanks Comet :-) people also need to consider the airport too......and the travel expert Simon Calder recently said that the most dangerous place during travelling is security because of the huge volumes of people that handle the trays etc...something we often forget too.
"https://reliefweb.int/report/china/coronavir…No social distancing on March 14th? Why? Europe was the epicenter of pandemia... Greece, Italy, Spain etc in Lockdown... Trump was declaring a national emergency. Deaths: 5,819 globally134 countries with cases"
"Right now using airports is a serious issue. We can only do so much ourselves, we can't control behaviour of others. There is a huge question about the use of recycled air in planes, there is talk of new filters but nothing done yet. A sensible person will be worried about these things but that's not everyone"
Exactly Mrs Lucy. You should protect yourself...
Our main consideration is being able to see our wee grandson again. We live in a safe area with a low density of population and it doesn't make sense to jeopardise that by risking travelling needlessly and possibly risking our health.
"Elena - I think you will find that the weekend of 14-15 March was when everything started changing - Greece announced that hotels would shut on 23 March and seasonal hotels would not open before the end of April, and Greece actually went into complete lockdown on 23 March. It is hardly surprising that social distancing wasn’t being deployed on flights at that time."
"Thank you Deborah, giving me the chance to remind about Greece dealing with SARS-CoV-2March 10th ( with no deaths and only 89 cases)Government decides to close Educational Institutions of all LevelsMarch 13th: closed Cafés, Bars, restaurants, museums, shopping centres, sports FacilitiesMarch 16th: closed Retail shops, churches...Whay was open?Only Supermarkets, Pharmacies, kiosks, delivery and take away food was open. That meant lockdownEdited: 8:02 am, May 19, 2020 "
"Exactly Elena - as I said - that was the weekend when everything started to change.Edited: 8:08 am, May 19, 2020 "
"I have to be honest. If (in capital letters) entry is allowed, I would rather agree to swim all the way to Crete than fly on a plane. Unless I'm flying myself some LSA, I'll give every other flight a wide berth.""for dummies"" - LSA is a category of aircraft, usually with only two seats)"
Swim all the way to Crete?Well here is the fit one. Young body and heart!Bravo...
Good luck with that swim Ntragkon....Vrisi beach to Ilingas and back just about finished me!
Comet.....please read my post properly rather than twisting what I said.
"https:/…The source: International Air Transport AssociationIATAEdited: 8:25 am, May 19, 2020 "
"Comet, post 20 said that it 'felt safer' not that it was safer. I have no idea what his local supermarket is like but know that the flight back was from Goa and everyone in the airport had to wear masks so that might have something to do with it. I'm finding that some trips to the supermarket are better than others. It's all well and good queuing outside to limit the amount of people in the supermarket and queuing for the checkout but supermarket aisles aren't wide enough for safe social distancing and none of my local supermarkets operate a one way system so people get too close if passing you in the aisles."
"Yes Gemma everyone had to wear masks, temperature checks were made before we could even get in to the airport and Goa at the time had no cases on the virus."

Thanks for posting that link Elena.
"Speaking about airlines, I would like to inform you thatKLM announces restarting flights June 6th (Amsterdam - Athens)Russia announces possible restart of international flights in July."
"Gillian, thank you for your support.(Comet, shut up, you distract me while I'm swimming...)Although, I see there are a lot of non-swimmers here and it seems that they didn't like the idea. They can't do anything about it. I'll swim (and fly), always and everywhere. Some will crawl forever."
"Don't be afraid Comet! As Cretan you are a brave one!Whatever you choose, flying or swimming... No sharks in Crete"
Aegean Airlines have informed me yesterday about renewals. Good on them.I’ve tried to swim in sea today. Water is still too cold for me. It wasn’t too bad with 43C outside though. Cold watermelon was nice and refreshing too.Yuri.
"I believe you, Elena. But there are plenty of creeping creatures and those slimy ones which Gemma noticed.Btw, thanks for the support.In the end, joke on the side, you'd rather make me swim the entire route than get into an easyjet cattle wagon."

DoreenAs others have advised I think you will have to make up your own mind. A couple of thoughts which may help.It seems to me that someone who is offering accommodation 50% below the full price may be desperate for cash up front and thus in financial difficulty. You don't say if the offer is from the property owner or an agent. I would be very worried if it was an agent or booking site. I had a bad experience in the last financial crisis when using an agent. Unknown to me there were 3 agents involved & my agent did not pay the middle agent in full. I had a week of hassle in the resort with everyone blaming someone else. The hotel was brilliant and ultimately took a hit on its part of its fee.I believe many of the booking sites are vulnerable to collapse at present. They have very little income and will struggle to fund their operations. All are similar to Car Trawler which is the largest booking site for car hire used by many major airlines. CarTrawler is being rescued at present by new investors. Existing investors will be wiped out & its lenders will have to write off 50% of their loans. I think many of the hotel booking sites are facing the same problem as Car Trawler. Except none of them are in as dominant a position as Car Trawler and are therefore not attractive to new investors.You might get a good bargain at present but you will be taking risks particularly if you pay the full price up front in the expectation you can get a full refund in case you cancel. The agent may be gone by then.
