Hi coming over in a few weeks are people wearing masks at the airport and on the plane want to be prepared. Thanks
not really no...might see a few at the airport
"If by being prepared means wearing a face mask yourself,why does it matter if others are doing it?Atb steve"
Not seen anyone wearing masks in Benidorm except for the Chinese lady who served me in the local Chino warehouse. No reports of any virus in Benidorm....yetSteve
"""Face masks play a very important role in places like hospitals, but there is very little evidence of widespread benefit for members of the public."" From the UK NHS site.Don't waste your money"
Thanks for advice and replies.
"Masks have limited ability to prevent viruses and are soon damp and uncomfortable. What they do however is stop us touching our mouths and experts say we touch our mouths, eyes and nose 90 times a day. That’s how the virus gets in, it can’t penetrate intact skin.I’d feel a bit embarrassed wearing one at first but planes can be germy so I’d go for it. Jules"
"If a mask works in a hospital then if treated in the same manner it must work in a plane.I've often been accused of wearing a mask, but unfortunately it's my face."
"Thanks decided we getting masks, hubby got copd so unless things go a lot worse still wants to go on holiday. We will wear them on plane as that is were we feel be most vulnerable . Now just got to find some anybody any ideas ."
"Perhaps do what you think is best for yourself and what you are happy with.Just been reading about wearing masks on a plane. Mask needs really to be well fitting, perhaps the sort of mask a tradesperson would wear to stop harmful dust when working. Also mentions about wiping down your airplane seat table and arm rests. If possible your headrest. Different fresh wipe for each. Important to keep yourself safe if you suffer from lung and breathing difficulies.Would agree, don't think it will be long before we notice airline staff wearing them. Quick turn around on these planes now. They are not all cleaned by cleaners anymore, just have aircraft crew doing a quick tidy up."
"We have been fitted with masks today, the whole process took about 20 mins, it's quite tricky getting them to fit properly. You have to do a series of movement tests.Wash your hands regularly and try not to touch your face.Dawn x"
"https:/…recoveredLots of statistics on the link above.The number of cases is always mentioned but, a figure which is not often mentioned on the news, are the recovery figures to date. Something like over 60,900 have recovered from the virus already.Edited: 12:40 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"Face masks must be worn correctly, changed frequently AND removed properly.Plus most of the paper options being worn do not have a respirator to filter out infectious air particles. Though the respirator type should not be used by infected patients. If you use the same one for too long it will become loose and not of any use either. Great for single one time use in hospitals etc. to prevent splashes or sprays of body fluids.Plus do people wash their hands before putting one on, or after taking them off? If not, useless once again..."
"I saw a few people on the way out wearing them. None on the plane on the way back. Saw a young couple at the airport when I got back wearing the ones my nail tech wears, with massive gaps at the sides, top and bottom. So those were effective lol. I have a couple of the N95 type ones but find them very claustrophobic to wear."
The masks worn by hospital staff are to stop them infecting patients not the other way round
Will come in handy in the resort when sewage overflows or on cala gerona where people have drunk too much and had a digestive spillage
"Lol this has turned into maskgate I was just going to get paper ones but seems they useless. No way could we wear n95 type they look like they are out of the torture chamber, just seen on you tube how to make your own masks out of a bra some people are hilarious ."
Our masks have been issued to protect us from any suspected cases that arrive at the hospital.Dawn x
Well Dawn that’s different altogether you definitely need all the protection you can get working in hospitals stay safe .
"No one is saying the obvious, but how do you eat and drink on the plane whilst wearing a mask? OK, maybe on a short haul flight like Benidorm you could not eat or drink, but no way can you last a long haul without."
"and if you do drink on the plane did the stewardess wash her hands between each customer ? , think of all the plates and cups you will eat and drink off over the tripid be making sure theres ample insurance to cover you if theres a case found at the hotel"
Just another take on the mask debate.Apparently ...and I am only basing this on information from the internet .... the masks are pretty useless anyway. They are more use to stop someone who already has the virus from passing it on.This might lead people to assume those wearing the masks think they are actually infected.
I'm planning to ignore masks and instead gargle with vodka. Might have to swallow after gargling though!!!
Good girl Carole !
Bear in mind not all masks will protect you. Lots of scammers buying cheap masks and selling them on eBay as protective masks when a hankie would do a better job. Jenny is correct it needs to be a DIY mask that is P3 rated for decent protection. Most are P2 which are better than nothing but won’t offer full protection.
"Post #9 susieq.Your hubby has copd. I doubt he would cope with wearing a mask for 3 hours. If that's your plan, I would urge him to try it at home first to get an idea of what it will be like."
"Hi tinto66 I agree no way could he wear one of those masks, we fly out two weeks tomorrow just monitoring it day by day. If we were fit and not golden oldies with health problems would not hesitate but got to make right decision for us ."
"Hi!It is worth remembering that the virus can also be transmitted by touch and that it can survive for short periods on surfaces.I am in a high-risk group but I will follow the advice that masks are not recommended.I shall be travelling to Benidorm in two weeks but if I were in any doubt at all I wouldn't go. I would lose a considerable amount of money, of course.I think everyone should apply this rule - if you are in ANY doubt, do not travel."
