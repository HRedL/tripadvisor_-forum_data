"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/2…Only thing is, depending on where you come from, you may well have some form of quarantine / self-isolation when you return home."
"If you are allowed into Spain in the first place ...."" Spain needs tourism, and tourism needs safety in both origin and destination. We will guarantee that tourists will not run any risks, nor will they bring any risk to our country.”"
"I think a healthy degree of skepticism is advised whenever anyone offers a ""guarantee"" about risks."
"Let us hope that this is not a case of too much, too soon.I wish everyone rude health, going forward, and much enjoyment in your future trips.The ball is now in the Airlines court.CheersAnthony K"
"The UK is to introduce a 14 day quarantine period, beginning on June 8th, for all visitors coming into Britain. There will be no exemptions for EU residents, during the first three weeks, then the situation will be reviewed.If this is Britain's ongoing position then I feel that Spain and other EU countries will reciprocate.We may have to look to July and August before we see something more positive.Anthony K"
"Spain is not reintroducing international travel until 1 July, (aside from a possible pilot scheme in the Balearics and Canarias from 21 June). Plenty of time for a total U turn or modification by the U.K. government. Barcelona has visitors from across the world, so probably won’t notice a few less from the U.K."
"Not positive, sorry ...Apparently yesterday the Spanish Health Minister said that the UK would NOT be on the first list of those countries who will be allowed access to Spain following the de-escalation of travel restrictions. Of course the situation can change from day to day - even hour by hour! Ms Patel, the UK Home Secretary, yesterday afternoon outlined the proposed quarantine restrictions to be placed on those coming into the UK, without exceptions for anyone from any EU countries. The UK quarantine restriction will be reviewed in three weeks time, and not unnaturally have been condemned by Airlines.Keep wellAnthony K"
"Hi. Can you give a link to the source please, as there has been a misquoted story from the tourist minister. Not seen anything from Minister Illa, but might have missed it. Thanks in advance."
Apologies for not having a source. If I am wrong then I apologise again.Anthony K
"No worries. The info coming out of Spain is ceasing to have any credulity. This morning, the minister for tourism stated that from the 22 June, the borders with Portugal and France would be open. This came as something of a surprise to the Prime minister of Portugal. Two hours later the Moncloa issued a statement correcting the tourism minister and reiterating that borders would not open until 1 July.At the same time, autonomous communities are no longer allowed to publish their own data on deaths or new infections as it has become clear that local figures are higher than those published by the ministry of health.This from a socialist government!"

"Thanks, but this is an old report. As far as the press in Spain is reporting, international travel recommences on 1st July. There is no exclusion for travellers from the UK whether for business or tourism. Schengen area, borderless travel is expected to be back in place by then. So, it would be virtually impossible to exclude UK residents who could simply circumvent any restriction by entering Spain vía France or Portugal across an unmanned border."
"Spanish authorities seem to giving mixed messages about whether UK visitors will have to quarantine for 14 days when visiting the country. Some officials say that UK visitors will have to quarantine and this is because the UK is making visitors from Spain quarantine in the UK. Other officials, however, are saying that UK visitors are so necessary that they will not have to undertake a period of quarantine in Spain.A clear policy decision needs to be made, certainly by the end of this month.Finally, many senior people, in the UK, are asking the Government to lift the 14 day quarantine period, for international visitors, that was only introduced yesterday.Keep well allAnthony K"
"From The Guardian newspaper, just three hours ago ... ""Spain is considering introducing a quarantine rule for UK visitors when the country reopens its borders to EU and Schengen area members on Sunday, the foreign minister has said.Arancha González Laya said the measure was being considered in response to the British government’s decision to require all international arrivals into the UK, including returning British residents, to self-isolate for 14 days.""Things seem to change almost day by day.Anthony K"
"Re: The present situation3 Jul 2020, 17:41Re: Coronavirus : What's the situation ?3 Jul 2020, 17:37UK Govt Foreign Office advice for those wishing to travel to Spain.From 4 July, Spain is exempt from the FCO advice against all non-essential international travel. This is based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks.This also means that you will not have to quarantine, at home, when you return to the UK.Anthony K"
"Are we sure that visitors from England will not have do 14 days quarantine when we arrive in Spain, as seems to be the case in the Netherlands?"
"Definitely no quarantine into Spain . This website is really good for letting you know any restrictions throughout Europe. https://reopen.europa.eu/en/map/ESPEdited: 1:30 pm, July 03, 2020 "
Definitely no quarantine when you arrive in Spain from other EU member states including the Uk which is still in the transition phase.
Another lock down?https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-848…B.
"The new Catalonia lockdown as reported in Spain.https://www.thelocal.es/20200704/catalonia-p…Edited: 10:44 am, July 04, 2020 "
"Just to help people who are intending to travel to Barcelona (the City). The outbreak is in the Lleida area, which is around 160 kms away. It involves a lock down affecting a little over 200k people rather than the exaggerated figure of 400k the UK press. Extract from Spain rtve.es news feed.“The President of the Generalitat, Quim Torra, has announced the decision to confine more than 200,000 people in the Segrià region due to the ""considerable increase"" in the spread of coronavirus in Lleida, according to a press conference, one day after the Emergency Medical System installed a field hospital next to the Vilanova University Hospital. “"
"Glad to see Quim Torra step in and take decicive action. The numbers effected are less than half of the population of Leicester, UK"
Whats worrying though is how many people from this area may have travelled around the area Barcelona Reus Salou ete etc and have spread Covid already. Its a worrying time for all of us more so taking the risk of sitting on a plane with people who may be infected .
"A tad worrying for us on the Balearic Islands, as plane loads of people from the mainland and other countries arrive each day having been encouraged to come on hols here. A person from Barcelona who flew in knowing he had tested positive on a PCR test has now been compulsorily detained on Ibiza. Months of lockdown for nothing."
