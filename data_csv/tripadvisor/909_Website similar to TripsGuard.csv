"Hi,I found a website similar to TripsGuard which gave me a easy list of every country and their current status, what the restrictions were and relevant links to the forms. But for the life of me can't find it after accidentally closing it.Anybody know similar websites?"
IATA (the airline association) has a web site about travel restrictions including the ones due to COVID-19 https:/â€¦1580226297.htm
The IATA site is the best as it uses the same data the airlines get
