"Hi everybody, I'm going to KL from the 6th until the 9th of February, from there I will leave to Lankgawi for 10 days. I just read that there is a case of the Coronavirus and that the person is put in quarantaine. Can anyone tell me how the ambiance is on the island? Are the people panicking? Do people walk on the street with mouth masks? Also because we're in the middle of Chinese New Year Celibrations.. Hope to hear from you guys!"
"Life is going on as normal but some people are wearing face masks, especially the hoteliers who are receiving guests from different countries."
There are some visitors wearing face masks as are some of the staff in local restaurants we use. The Pharmacy nearest to us had a sign saying they had sold out of masks....apart from that folks are on the beach and all seems normal.
"I was reading that some pharmacies (not sure where but don't think it was Malaysia), are hiking up the prices for the face masks because they are selling so well.They need reporting for doing this."
"Thank you for your replies guys, it's helpful! Is it safe to conclude that I will have to take face masks with me for the arrivals to the airports and other crowded areas? And of course washing hands frequently and taking anti bacterial gel with me."
Yes you are correct to take those precautions.Enjoy your holiday and stay safe.
"If you are going to wear a face mask then I suggest you start by wearing it on your flight, not just at arrivals."
Nothing happening here with the virus all the Chinese hiding in their hotels
There isn't a vaccine yet available for the corona virus as yet maybe in a couple of months as scientists don't have a breakthrough to date.
"I got my mask from Lazada online because pharmacies running out face mask. I live in Kuala Lumpur and nothing happen here. Life goes on. The 8 china people that suspected with coronavirus is in quarantine in CDC Sg, Buloh which is far away from Kuala Lumpur. CDC is a disease center."
Ohh ...is it true? Becayse qe are flying tomorrow to langkawi with our 11 mnth old baby? Is it safe to viist ?
"Is what true??As you are leaving tomorrow it is a bit late to start worrying now, I'm afraid."
"Oh dear... I'm in Pantai Cenang, the most concerning thing at the moment is deciding on where to eat next."
The little girl with coronavirus left the hospital yesterday:https:/…cxrecs_s
"Hi, I ll travel to Langkawi on 8th .. what is going on there?.. is it safe to travel with kid??"
"All appears to be normal, life goes on."
"What is the latest re Langkawi Coronavirus, I’m traveling 8 th March , Am I safe , ?"
"Probably just as safe as you are at home, wherever you are."
"Hi Mohamed Z,How was it? Any trouble? Is it safe?Thanks"
"Hi, I decided to cancel my trip last minute. I found it to be to big of a risk to take with a small child. Would have gone if it was just 2 adults. I am planning to go when the dust settles."
If you are not happy travelling at this moment in time then best to cancel and arrange your holiday at a later date.There is no point in paying lots of money to be unhappy.
This exactly :D
"May l know how your trip in Langkawi, is it okay?my trip will be next week, now l still consider whether want to go or not."
"LYK. Who are you asking?Our trip to Langkawi was fine, We will be returning in a couple of weeks."
"Hi , I am traveling to langkawi on 24 th April, with my two kids ( one and 7 year old ) . I am just worried about the Coronavirus out break . As traveling with little kids is difficult.. please suggest me the situation in langkawi and Malaysia. Thanks in advance."
HiIt is almost two months before you are travelling to Langkawi so no one can possibly say what the situation will be like at that time.All you can do is keep watch on what the news and what your own government is advising about travel.
"Hi , I have planned to go to Langkawi April end with my two children ( 1 and 7 yrs ) I am concerned about the Coronavirus outbreak. How safe will it be ...."
"We have five new cases today which brings up the total to 55 cases now (with 22 discharged). All 33 patients are now either at Sungai Buloh Hospital or Kuala Lumpur Hospital which are both in Kuala Lumpur. Based on this info released by our Health Ministry via a press release about 3 hours ago, suffice to say the situation is very safe in Langkawi. For more info:https:/…Hope this helps."
No one can possibly tell you what the situation will be like in two months time no matter how many times you ask the same questio n.
Thank you so much .

I was supposed to travel to Kuala Lumpur on March 15th. Should I cancel the trip?
SanjaOnly you can answer that question. It is not up to us to tell you what to do. Check what your own government is saying about travel and be guided by that.
Are you safe after travel? Lol! Im going on 21-23/3
"Hy LiongAs safe as anyone is, anywhere at the moment."
"I cancelled the trip. I don't want to travel in this atmosphere of uncertainty, when most of the major happenings are cancelled or altered because of this virus."
"Wishicouldretire, wishiwasntgoinghome.Lot safer than in UK."
We are here in the Berjjaya at the moment and everything is wuite calm. When you speak to the staff they are as concerned as everyone is but there are only a few wearing face masks. The resort is VERY quiet as the hotel is only running at about 20% capacity and this is expected to drop over the next two weeks. The weather is very hot and all else is fine
"hey, what if we are travelling from KL to Langkawi, is it still ok to travel?"

"Hi, We are supposed to be travelling from KL to Langkawi on Friday 20th. No flight changes stated as of yet. As many hotels are closing in KL will this also be the case in Langkawi? We have not yet booked a hotel incase plans have to change. Any advice would be really helpful thank you :)"
Even if you do manage to travel to Langkawi nearly all the restaurants and bars are closed until at least the end of March and tourists are being asked to stay in their hotel rooms and order room service.Not much of a holiday in my opinion. If you can cancel then do so.
