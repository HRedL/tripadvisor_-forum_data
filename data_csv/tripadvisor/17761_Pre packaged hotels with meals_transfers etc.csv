"Hi. Looking at visiting the islands with my wife. I was just wondering if anybody had any suggestions of a company that does pre packaged vacations? (Not flights)Would be going for 9-12 day’s. 2 nights at one island, 3 on another etc. Meals and transfers on the flyer would be nice if that is available as well. Thanks. Devo"
"You say you are going for 9-12 days but only 2 nights at one resort and 3 at the other in the Yasawas. You may find that most resorts have minimum nights stay apart from budget and backpacker resorts. There are top end resorts that are all inclusive, some mid range that have compulsory meal plans others that you just pay for what you eat. The Captains Lounge on the Yasawa Flyer offers snack food and tea coffee and drinks inclusive. There is a food bar which offers hot food and alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks on the boat too. Resorts can book this for you but apart from the Captains Lounge you pay for what you eat and drink. Anything from the food bar is at cost. More information re type of resorts you are looking for would be helpful.Edited: 11:09 pm, December 01, 2019 "
Devo I would firstly go to your local travel agency and see what they come up with With that information come back again to the forum and then we maybe able to assist further on their thoughts.
"Can I suggest you are trying to have too many stops. I'd suggest 3 resorts max, ideally 2 to allow yourself to relax at your resort, maybe do some offered excursions or activities and get to know the other, always interesting guests, and not have to check out then wait too long for the transfer to your next place. It's all pretty easy to just book online yourself direct as Yasawa resorts are all stops on the Yasawa Flyer are done in consecutive order dropping guests up in the morning's run then back from about midday, this is worth keeping in mind as to when you will check out and when the transfer happens to the next place. Boat travel can be booked in advance or on the day for the same cost (which price is set at the resorts you link up to go to. For travel is only 4.30hr max from Denaru to highest stop so breakfast hotel and snacks on-board is sufficient as you will have lunch served on arrival at your resort the first day (and not the last day, without cost, usually). Enjoy!Edited: 3:34 am, December 13, 2019 "
"Thurston-Howell 4th, love your ‘monika’. Does ‘Lovey’ travel to Fiji with you?"
"DevoHow did you go with your checks.Do you have any islands you may want to visit yet?.Edited: 6:00 pm, December 14, 2019 "
"Best idea is to either start at the top and work your way down the island chain or do the reverse. The Awesome Adventures website has a list of the resorts so you can plan your trip. I agree two and no more than three resorts would be plenty, pick different areas."
"We always go to the furthest resort first as we enjoy day one stopping off at all the islands on the way.It is a beautiful introduction to the Fiji islands.Also shorter distance to head back to Denarau.Edited: 2:49 am, December 15, 2019 "
"Hi. Thanks for everybody’s insight, greatly appreciAted. I think we will just book resorts on our own. It is my wife and I (40’s) and just enjoy relaxing, reading, swimming, snorkeling and enjoying a few cocktails. My wife will need decent-good accomadations, no hostel type places. Planning on doing 3-4 islands, haven’t quite decided as to how many days yet. I am just curious as to what everybody’s favourite island is and why?Thanks. Devo"
Hi Devo.When we travel we normally do 2 resorts due to the cost of island transfers.We liked resorts in the Yasawas  Blue lagoon resort. 1)Lovely westerly facing beach (not affected greatly by the trade winds that blow between may and September).2) nice for hiking to the top of the hill at back of the resort for 360 degree views.3) level beach with good snorkelling straight off the beach. Barefoot manta1)Best island for snorkelling IMO2) opportunity to swim with the majestic Mantarays (May to October)3) Rustic Sunset Beach ensuited safari tented accommodation.I would suggest you purchase your duty free liquor at the airport on arrival as drinks at the resorts can be expensive.Although you cannot take it to lunch or dinner with you. You can drink it on your own Bure patio.
"We prefer the smaller island resorts, more personal, where you are known by name not by room number. There are many choices in both the Mamanuca and Yasawa Island Groups. Suggest you come back to the Forum when you have resorts you are considering for opinions or read the reviews on this site for those resorts."
"Thanks for you help, greatly appreciated. Think I got it narrowed down, 4 nights at blue lagoon resort and 3 nights at barefoot manta. Will book the transfers on line with the flyer and have those taken care of. The one question I do have, our flights will leave @9:00 pm. Is this cutting it to tight to get to the airport as I see the flyer arrives back at 6:00pm. Not overly excited about spending money on a sea plane. I think I will have to stay in nadi that night unless somebody has a better solution that I am unaware of. Thanks again. Devo"
"Great choices Devo, hope you enjoy them both as we did.To get back to the airport the best idea is to book a Denarau hire car transfer. You could do this yourself or get Barefoot Manta to arrange this for you.The drive from Denarau to Nadi airport is around 25-30 minutes and will cost around FJ $50-60 dollars so you will have plenty of time to book in and catch your flight.It has been done many times before by others.The check in counter opens up 3 hrs before take off and closes 1hr before.The hire car drivers only take cash so best to get some when you arrive (the western Union office in the arrivals hall is open to all incoming flights) make sure you get a few small denomination notes as they may not have change."
With the present Covid-19 epidemic I would not be in any rush to make bookings. No one knows when this will end. You may find that there will be a lot of ‘specials’ on offer by resorts to entice travellers back. Meanwhile stay safe.
"You don't say when you propose to travel to Fiji but it is best in the ""dry season"" between May and October where there is still some likelihood of the occasional rain but normally as an afternoon thunderstorm."
"We are planning on the last week of November and first week of December but not booking anything until this covid 19 dies down and travel is safe and recommended. Who knows, maybe have to push it feb/March??? Thanks again"
Great idea in waiting .They have had 5 cases of the Coronovirus in Fiji and all have recovered which is promising so fingers crossed they can escape the large numbers elsewhere.
