"I read that visitors from the EU countries can enter Italy starting June 3. Does that mean you have to be a European citizen or that you can simply transit through a European airport? We’re hoping to visit for 2 weeks end of June. Also, we live in one of the safest Covid cities in the US with very low rates. Our neighborhood of 50k cases has had a total of 30 cases. If Americans are restricted will the Italian authorities take into account which part of US that one is from so it will be based more on science and data? Thank you"
Suggest you keep an eye on this Italian government link which was last updated on 6th May 2020: https://www.esteri.it/mae/en/ministero/norma…mesh
Even if it's open it does not mean you have to go. Italy is not going anywhere. The virus is still around and still deadly. All of this isolation was about flattening the curve not about eliminating the virus. Only a vaccine will truly clear the situation.
"I can answer your question based on the Italian Decree signed into law yesterday, which takes effect on June 3. The decree states that, effective June 3, ANY NATURAL PERSON may enter Italy from any of these areas and for any lawful reason, without any need to quarantine unless they have COVID symptoms:1. E.U. countries2. Countries which adhere to the Schengen Treaty3. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland4. Andorra and Monaco5. San Marino and Vatican City.This is not restricted to CITIZENS of the foregoing countries, but (I believe) to any lawful resident thereof. Consequently, a U.S. citizen who is lawfully resident in any such country should (by my interpretation) be allowed entry into Italy for tourism, beginning on June 3, without any extra documentation apart from a passport and (where necessary) proof of lawful residence within the E.U.In my opinion, THIS DOES NOT EXTEND TO U.S. CITIZENS WHO ATTEMPT TO ENTER ITALY BY TRANSITING THROUGH ANOTHER E.U. COUNTRY, but who are not residents therein. Moreover, owing to the E.U. travel ban, U.S. Citizens are not allowed entry into ANY E.U. country for tourism, at least through June 15, when the travel ban comes up for possible renewal. (Entry is allowed only for documented exigencies). Consequently, it should not be possible (even after June 3) for a U.S. citizen to travel to Italy by transiting through another E.U. country, unless for a documented exigency or for work.We need to see what happens after June 15. It is possible, through perhaps unlikely, that the travel ban will be dropped or relaxed to allow entry into the E.U. by U.S. citizens for tourism. We also need to see whether certain E.U. countries (such as Italy) will allow entry into Italy from countries outside of the E.U., without there being a uniform E.U. rule.The situation is very fluid, and U.S. citizens wishing to travel to Italy later this year for tourism should really pay attention to the unfolding developments."
@3 sums it up well...and I will add that where you live in the US will not factor into this equation at all. Either US passports can enter or not. June is honestly way too optimistic given the US is probably the hottest spot in the world right now.
"Just because you live in San Francisco doesn't mean you spend all your time there. You could have spent the past 30 days in the heart of heavily infected Queens, NY for all they know. You could be a doctor, or have an intimate relationship with one, and have spent the past 30 days treating the few COVID patients San Francisco does have. Or you might have spent the past 30 days doing nothing in healthy, uninfected San Fran, but flown into Italy on a plane with half a dozen carriers of the virus. All they know about is the experience of the US as a whole and how our federal govt is, or isn't, managing the disease."
"An additional complication is that all these plans for 'reopening' are based on the assumption that the rate of new infections will be within acceptable limits. It may not be the wisest idea to travel any great distance until it becomes apparent if those assumptions are correct. If infections spike in an area where you are traveling you could face considerable difficulties (and health risk) if those areas locked down again. As was stated above, Italy isn't going anywhere.Edited: 6:05 am, May 18, 2020 "
"So far as I know, all the Schengen countries still will not admit people from the USA. There is no way that someone travelling from the USA can enter any Schengen country."
"I don't think the US is admitting people from Schengen yet, so it seems reasonable if it also applies in reverse. Another point that crossed my mind is that if I was living somewhere with a low infection rate, I don't think I'd want to go anywhere else that is going to be less safe in all probability."
"At the moment, and through at least June 15, there is a travel ban into all E.U. countries, although travel to Italy (and perhaps to other E.U. countries, depending on local regulations) is allowed for ""specific, concrete and verifiable reasons of absolute urgency, work or health"". Travelers meeting those conditions are required to fill out a government form upon embarkation and/or upon arrival in Italy. The form requires the full address and telephone number where the traveler will be staying in Italy during the mandatory 14-day quarantine period, the particulars of the exigency, and the method of transportation used upon arrival in Italy to reach the traveler's living location (which cannot be public transportation such as a bus or train). The traveler must also state that he/she has not been found to be positive to COVID-19 and is not subject to any other quarantine requirement. The traveler can be questioned by immigration authorities at passport control in Italy to corroborate the information on the form. Travelers who don't meet the ""exigency"" requirements, or who provide conflicting or doubtful information, can be DENIED ENTRY into Italy. as determined by the passport control officials.During the 14-day quarantine in Italy, the traveler cannot leave his abode, not even to buy groceries (that itself can create a problem). Health authorities may contact the traveler at the telephone number provided for verification purposes. If the traveler does not answer the calls, health officials or law enforcement could be dispatched. It is abundantly clear that these extremely limited travel conditions EXCLUDE ANY FORM of tourist or leisure travel.The provisions which open Italy's borders on June 3 to leisure travelers coming from E.U. countries (without a quarantine requirement) do NOT extend to U.S. citizens coming from outside the E.U. and transiting through other E.U. airports. It is unclear (at least to me) whether it allows U.S. citizens LEGALLY RESIDING in an E.U. country to enter Italy for travel or leisure. It is very important to note that each E.U. country can impose restrictions on RE-ENTRY from Italy, such as a quarantine, thereby making leisure travel quite problematic.All of the foregoing might change after June 15, when the E.U. will need to decide whether to continue the travel ban or to modify/relax it. I think it is very possible that the travel ban will be continued, at least for travelers from non-E.U. countries of origination. Any such decision should intuitively be applied to all E.U. countries, but it is not beyond imagination that some E.U. countries might try to ""open up"" individually to certain non-E.U. countries. (All of this is pure speculation on my part).Bottom line is that the situation is very fluid, and travelers wanting to go to Italy in the near future will need to pay very close attention to developments.Edited: 8:44 am, May 18, 2020 "
"Something else I would take into account in considering a visit to Italy, regardless of your citizenship, is what your home country advises, and whether it has resumed normal staffing levels at its consulates there."

"Think about it. If you lived in Italy, a country where fewer than 1000 new coronavirus infections appear every day, would you want to invite people who live in a country where an average day sees 20,000 new infections, a country that does many fewer tests for infection than it should, so the number of infected may be much higher, a country that has had as many deaths as the next three countries combined?"
Simple answer ...no way!!
"Perhaps the query then, why would Italy then open its borders to foreign tourism and invite contagion from abroad??When a week ago that wasn't so??Actually a week ago we were only permitted travel in our region of residence, and only with purpose and special reasons.We have been locked down for months, and all our gains will be squandered for short-term profit.Vagabonda"
"“Actually a week ago we were only permitted travel in our region of residence, and only with purpose and special reasons.”Absolutely but it was the comune and some are so small (I’m thinking San Quirico in Tuscany) most people in reasonable health can easily walk from one end to the other, so that should give some perspective on just how tight those travel restrictions were.“We have been locked down for months, and all our gains will be squandered for short-term profit”Oh, I couldn’t agree more (as does just about everyone I know) and echo the words of our regional President in Tuscany, Enrico Rossi, that it’s too much too fast. Fine that the bars have re-opened, it’s weird but it’s manageable from both staff and customers’ side, but gyms from 25th May? Cinemas and theatres from 15th June? Gyms are among the most unhealthy places on earth even at the best of times, the mere thought of going to one right now leaves me cold. And surely social distancing and the resulting drop in numbers will barely justify indoor places of entertainment putting the lights and A/C on? It’s going to be very interesting to monitor those contagion figures from now on …."
"Yes, we were restricted within our comune.And yes, even travel within a region is restricted, and for purpose - #9.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18776…Opening to foreign tourism is just too much too fast!https:/…106649203It will be interesting to monitor contagion curves.VagabondaEdited: 1:35 pm, May 19, 2020 "
Tunisia is opening their borders in June 27th to Americans with no restrictions like Covid test or quarantine. You might be able to enter Italy that way.
"When citizens and residents of Italy are saying 'too much too soon', and basically saying please do not come here, I think it's incumbent upon us to listen, not to try and find a way to sneak around the regulations."
"Italy is not in any case open to passengers arriving from Tunisia (except Italian nationals and residents, and those permitted in the limited list of approved reasons to visit, most of whom must quarantine for 14 days after arrival). Click Italy on the map shown here https:/…1580226297.htm to see current regulations."
