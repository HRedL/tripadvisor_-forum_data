Hello everybody..We had a flight from Manila with layout in Guangzhou to Amsterdam the 13th. February and just yesterday our agency informed us that the airlane (China Southern) cancelled our flight. The can't offer to us another alternative flight so the agency offered only to refund us the amount of the return ticket. That is extremely bad offer as we can't fly anymore from Philippines to Amsterdam without a middle stop in China so basically we need to fly to.a close country and then get an extra flight to Amst. That would cost us at least 500€. Per person and that's definitely not the amount the company will give to us.Has anyone experienced this kind of situation? Is the 1st time and we have so short notice and really dont know what to do. I'll appreciate any help.
Have you got travel insurance?
There is basically nothing you can do. Airlines cancel flights fir different reasons. The corona virus is causing all sorts of issues with flights through China. When an airline cancels a flight they can give you a refund. They don’t have to rebook you a new ticket on a different airline.
"Hi Wes, thanks for your reply. How is possible to give you a tiny refund that basically won't even cover the 30% of the following expenses cause of their cancelation?"
Because you are owed only the refund of your ticket price for your cancelled flight. The airline isn’t responsible for anything else.
"""How is possible to give you a tiny refund that basically won't even cover the 30% of the following expenses cause of their cancelation?""In the fare rules / T&C's you have accepted, it is clearly stated that the airline is not liable for consequential damage.These costs are maybe covered trough a cancellation insurance.You will get the refund from the airline, minus maybe a fee from your agent. And it can take some time as well, till you get your refund, especially as you have a middle man in between you and the airline."
have you spoken to your travel insurance company?
You generally get a tiny refund if you paid a tiny fare.
"""we can't fly anymore from Philippines to Amsterdam without a middle stop in China so basically we need to fly to.a close country and then get an extra flight to Amst.""There are plenty of 1-stop alternatives which do not involve a connection in China - via the Gulf with several airlines, via Singapore, via Istanbul, via Taipei - so I don't understand the issue?"
"@Lenny The main issue is that the days we wanted to fly the only option is thought China Air or 42 hours with Oman and that's not an issue but to spent additional 1100€ each only to.book our next flights is way too much. That's why I asked for any Assistant as I heard in the past airlanes who used to canceled flights use ls to refund the passengers with full amount,provided accommodation etc"
"Look up the definition of the word ""refund"". You are going to be refunded. what you paid. They are not responsible for anything else."
"I think you are confusing this with EU261 regulations which do not apply outside the EU except on EU airlines.>> 42 hours with Oman and that's not an issue but to spent additional 1100€ each only to.book our next flights is way too much. <<on the 13th there is Emirates via Dubai for €552 per person (21 hours total time)Many people will be in the same position as you and are having to rebook flights. If your travel insurance does not cover it then you will need to pay it somehowEdited: 2:17 am, February 06, 2020 "
I'm confused about your €1100 ADDITIONAL p.p. I see 1 way flights on the 13th for €400-550.
"In addition to Emirates - Qatar, Etihad,Singapore and Turkish give you a one stop routing MNL > AMS that avoid areas that come within in the remit the Filipino ban.Unfortunatley walk up single fares are not going to be cheap and you'll be need to try and cover any consequential loss from your insurance."
"I'm afraid it is what it is. The coronavirus is undoubtedly the cause of the cancelled flight, and the situation is causing a lot of problems.The airline isn't responsible for either the virus or the knock on effects such as additional expenditure that might be required for certain travellers. I hope that you have travel insurance and that it will cover you for this situation.I also hope that the advice and suggestions given to you here will help."
">>> The coronavirus is undoubtedly the cause of the cancelled flight, and the situation is causing a lot of problems <<<=========Since Sunday the Filipino Government has implemented a travel ban that covers all foreigners arriving from (including transiting pax) China, Hong Kong and Macau."
"Perhaps an off-the-wall suggestion here -If the issue is that you are Dutch citizens now stranded in the Philippines and you cannot afford to get home, could the Dutch Consulate help to repatriate you?"
A number of folks have suggested looking to one’s travel insurance for assistance. In this instance the flight cancellations have been caused by an epidemic. I’ve looked at a few policies and listed among the exclusions is epidemics. I fear there will be quite a few unhappy travelers as this situation plays out.
"Just for my knowledge, what is the general refund policy if the airline cancels the return flight? Is it 50% of the full fare you paid or less?"
"I would imagine it would be whatever you paid for it. Normally flights are shown as outbound with a choice of times or if no choice just the one flight with the price, and then same again for the inbound."

"If the airline cancels your flight, of course you receive a 100% refund."
"It looks like it is becoming quite an issue for the Filipino authorities, the OP is most certainly not on their own.https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asi…https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/2/5…The other issue the OP needs to be cognisant of, is that they don't overstay. Assuming that they are on the standard 30 day visa waiver that most Europeans get on arrival. If that's looks like getting compromised it would be prudent to be proactive and contact the BoI to see what exemptions or contingency is in place in this situation, to avoid further financial penalty.Edited: 10:27 am, February 06, 2020 "

"As noted, it is what it is. Expect no further assistance from the airline. Buy a ticket and go home. If you have insurance it may or may not be of assistance."
"""If the airline cancels your flight, of course you receive a 100% refund.""If you flew the first leg but the return flight gets cancelled, I'm assuming you would only get 50% of what you paid for the entire fare, correct?"
You get back whatever the return fare was. It may not be 50%.
Round trip fares are not necessarily twice the amount of a one way fare. R_Squared is right that you will be refunded whatever the difference was between a one way and a round trip ticket at the time you booked.
Is it a full moon?

"How is possible to give you a tiny refund that basically won't even cover the 30% of the following expenses cause of their cancelation?""That's unfortunate because any extra expenses as a result of the new flights are not covered.My advice, next time you book a trip:1-Make sure to book directly with the airline NOT an agent.2-Make sure to have a decent travel insurance.4-Try to book ""refundable"" flights, hotel rooms, etc.5-Use your credit card for bookings as an added security."
