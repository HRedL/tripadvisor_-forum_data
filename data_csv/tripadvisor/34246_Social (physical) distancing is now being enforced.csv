"Message from a friend:"" Just had a a line of Policia & Federales vehicles drive down our streets with a little siren announcing “No Leaving Your House”. Finally it appears they will be enforcing social distancing.""I am also told that they are telling people on Playa Centro and Plays Norte to go home and stay indoors. They are going by my house on the airport strip with the same message."
Wow. How about grocery shopping?
I don't know. I imagine some accommodation will have to be made.
Are they closing the beaches?
"That really surprises me. I decided to spend most of my time at my place in Merida during the crisis and they do make suggestions. but no demanding you comply. But most seem to be mostly staying in. And many restaurants have gone to take out or delivery only. I was at Soriana for groceries yesterday and while they are taking precautions, the store was busy and well stocked for the most part."
"I think that many people showed up on a Sunday afternoon to use the beaches as they are used to doing and they were not distancing themselves at all. People as foolish as this need to be told to go home. I think things will be more ""normal"" tomorrow."
"I agree, Islawoman. Some have no common sense and need to be ordered to do what is the right thing to do."

FB just said they closed the beaches today.
"In Cancun they're basically doing the same thing on the beaches in the hotel zone. Police are riding up and down the beaches with recordings playing advising tourist to get off the beach and go inside and stay inside. Por Esto reports that this is a result of the Federal Government (finally) advising people to stay home and not leave except for work, groceries and medical reasons. But , at least in Cancun, the beaches technically are not closed. It's possible Isla's beaches are technically open but the police will tell anyone there to go home."
I'm a little confused on the ferry issue. Are they still bringing tourists/visitors over? Or is it operating just for residents?
The ferries are running every 2 hours although sometimes it's closer to 3 hours and there must be an empty seat between everyone. I believe there's a maximum percentage of capacity as well. On Isla they cut 50% of the buses running as well. And they are now every 15 minutes and can be no more than 30% full.
Thanks Joan. What I really wanted to know is whether anyone can take ferry to Isla. Or just residents. I guess anyone just reduced frequency.
"I haven't heard any restrictions being put in place but that may change. I can't imagine why people would go now that they know the police will basically throw you off the beach. But as far as I know, they aren't requiring any ID to buy a ticket.....yet."

"In some of the photos I was sent of authorities telling beach goers to leave, the people looked like non-Mexicans. I don't know if they had accommodations here, or have homes or were day visitors."
How are things today?
"Here's an article that appears in today's Riviera Maya News:Riviera Maya NewsMarch 30, 2020Home » Isla Mujeres authorities shut down water activities, invite people to stay homeIsla Mujeres authorities shut down water activities, invite people to stay homeIsla Mujeres authorities shut down water activities, invite people to stay homeBY RIVIERA MAYA NEWS ON MARCH 30, 2020Isla Mujeres, Q. R. — The municipal government of Isla Mujeres has begun implementing additional measures to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2.Over the weekend, personnel from the Harbor Authority and Civil Protection of Isla Mujeres undertook a tour of island beaches with the goal of preventing tourist and recreational vessels from anchoring.At the same time, other municipal and federal officials were out visiting beaches and other public spaces encouraging people to stay at home to avoid the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) the official name given to the COVID-19 coronavirus.Merced Ortiz Maya, director of Civil Protection pointed out that the Port Captaincy issued a circular ordering that the departure of vessels for tourism, minor recreational activities and sports be denied, adding that the denial includes Mexican and foreign vessels for private and recreational purposes.“We have the firm commitment from the municipal president Juan Carrillo Soberanis, to double efforts to preserve public health in the municipality. We are working hand-in-hand with the Port Captaincy for the health of the municipality, and we continue to invite people to stay in their homes. It is not a vacation. Tourist and recreational navigation is restricted. We are facing a health alert,” said Ortiz Maya.Jaime Ongay Ortiz, general director of Public Security explained that they have been touring island beaches and public spaces, inviting sun bathers and pedestrians to return to their homes and thus contribute to the government actions being taken in the face of the world situation.Ortiz Maya clarified that free movement is not being restricted to anyone, but rather that “the population is kindly invited to contribute to preventing the spread and contagion of the virus in the municipality” adding that it is everyone’s obligation to comply with preventive measures in the face of this global health alert."
“Invited” or told to get off the beaches?
"I'm gathering it is a very strong invitation, lol. They are making a point of saying the freedom to move about is not restricted but I think they're making it very clear that they aren't wanted there. I'm sure they're saying it in such a way that people know it's an ""invitation"" that should not be refused. I'm guessing this language is being used because even though Lopez Obredor is now (finally) asking people to stay home he refuses to order it and is all about making sure the government is not accused of restricting people's freedom of movement. Now I just wish they would shut down the ferries for anyone who doesn't love or work there. Isla has been very lucky. I think it's the only place around here that doesn't have any confirmed cases. It would be nice if they did what they could to continue that."
"I often seen the word invite used when it is much more than an invitation. Like saying you are invited to obey traffic rules. I suppose it is just the kind nature of the people here who do not really like to give orders. I saw last night they caught 20 who violated the overnight curfew in Cozumel and ""invited"" them to spend the night in jail."
I wasn’t sure if it’s a language/translation thing. Thanks Robert.
"Yeah, I doubt they've had one single person refuse their so called ""invitation"" without becoming a guest of the city for a night."
"Thanks also, Joan. Didn't see your post before Robert :)"
