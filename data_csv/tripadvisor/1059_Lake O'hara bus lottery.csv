How many applications can you put in for the bus draw?
"As many as you like. For $10, you can put in up to six requests. (Note that all requests on one application have o be for the same number of seats.) The deadline is a bit over 24 hours away from now."
I know this is the first year of the lottery so maybe this can't be answered. However does anyone know how quickly you are likely to be informed of whether you have been successful or not in the lottery? I have entered for 3 different days and would like to make other bookings for various activities but can't until I know if I have been successful and for which day.
"What other attractions, as they may not need to be booked very far in advance?"
"Looking to also book an early shuttle bus from the park & ride to Lake Louise one morning, the Banff Gondola Sky Experience package one evening and a boat trip probably on Lake Minnewanka."
"Thank you krp329. I didn't think it was made really clear that you could put in multiple applications, but thought so. I think they were trying to make it more fair, but this way, people with more money do have a better chance as they can afford to put it more applications. I wish it was 1 per person. But it is less stressful. Amci, it does say you will be notified by email within 2 weeks - After March 1, and have 2 weeks to confirm or your seats will go to someone else."
"Thanks oceans61, I had not seen that when I entered the lottery."
"The Parks Canada shuttle buses to Lake Louise and Moraine Lake cannot be reserved until April 1st. Previously, there were about 17K requests for the ~3600 day use seats for the Lake O’Hara shuttle; I’m sure it will be much higher this year, so chances are slim."
I have received an email this morning that I was unsuccessful in the lottery.
I was unsuccessful too :(
Me too.
"I had 5 applications, all of them were unsuccessful."
"I had 6 applications and did not get seats. I am bummed, but chances were so slim. It was nice to get such quick notice"
"Bummer for those who didn't get seats. We got three for Friday, July 10, 830 am, and are staying just up the road at Kicking Horse Campground. Now hoping the Alpine Circuit will be clear enough is snow to hike that early in the season!"
I entered 3 times and was unsuccessful all three times. I will check periodically to see if someone opts out of their win.
"Fingers crossed for you, zootable. July 10th is pretty early in the season, though, for the Alpine Circuit. But there is no shortage of stellar trails there!I entered only once, but with six choices. I had originally wanted some of those choices to be for two seats ), and some for three (some of the days chosen were a weekend day, when a third person could have joined us, but the system didn’t allow for that.Edited: 5:12 pm, March 01, 2020 "
Just checked and one of my days has availability but there is only one seat and I need two :(
Are there any options for getting there besides the shuttle and the long walk? Any private companies or UBER that offer a shuttle?
Well Kevin you can walk up the 11 km but there are no other vehicles allowed on the road.
"You could also try to get a booking at the Lake O'Hara lodge. The lodge runs a bus for their own guests.You could also try for a camping reservation. It's the same Parks Canada shuttle as the day visitors, but there is a separate quota of seats allocated to campers.Of course, the odds of getting one of those bookings isn't any better, and possibly worse, than getting day bus tickets.Another possible option, is through a commercial guide. There are no guarantees, but there are some seats allocated to guides. You'd have to commit to booking the guide, and shortly before your trip, you find out if you're going to O'Hara, or will hike in an alternate area.Edited: 9:28 am, March 02, 2020 "
How bad is the walk? We are both in our mid 30s and in good shape although we aren't used to elevation.
"11 kms is 6.8 miles, back and forth it adds 13.6 miles of walking to whatever you are planning to do in the area, Time wise it will take 6-7hrs to walk 14miles so take that out of your total available time as well."
"A camping reservation can’t be used for day-use access to Lake O’Hara - it says right on the web page that if you show up for the bus with no camping equipment, you’ll be turned away. Anyway, the camping reservations sold out for the season in 45 minutes on the day the online reservations opened back in January. Kevin, at almost 14 km and with something like 400 metres of elevation gain, the hike up the fireroad would be rated a moderate hike, all on its own. Lake O’Hara is a pretty lake, but it’s not Lake O’Hara itself that is the draw, but the network of hiking trails that goes up from the lake. There are lots and lots of beautiful hikes in Banff, Yoho and Jasper National Parks; for visitors coming with limited time, I would not recommend spending your precious time doing a 5 to 7 hour fireroad hike... really, there are so many options that would be better use of your time."
"Thanks for the reply. Are there any particularly lesser known hikes that won't take up as much time? I was thinking about King Creek Canyon. Again, I'm in decent shape but I'm not a daredevil. :)"
"Sorry, I am not familiar with that one. Google tells me it’s in K-Country, so I am sure some of the Calgary-area hikers, like CalgaryAl or Littlechild, will chime in."
Check out the Jade Lakes trail in Mt Revelstoke NP.
"I've never been in King Creek in the summer - only in the winter. It's certainly pretty, at least as far as I've been, though I'm not sure it would be on the top of my list. Definitely not 'lesser known' - in fact, I'd say it's quite popular, at least among locals. Lots of families go there for short hikes.As a note, I believe the canyon/area has special significance for the local first nations people, so there are sometimes items left there and I think there may be some old pictograms. So especially important to be respectful, and careful to avoid any damage to the rock/surroundings.It's a canyon, so no comparison to Lake O'Hara, and I think there are more interesting canyons in the parks (Mistaya, Marble etc)."
"King crk Canyon isn't anything special. Rawson lake in Kananaskis Peter Lougheed park is much more attractive, or simply hike along the shoreline trail at Upper Kananaskis lake past the waterfall as far as you like."
"My girlfriend and I both applied for our 3 dates (both buses on each day to make it 6 applications total). Not surprised we didn't win. Disappointed that they let people pay for multiple applications, but I guess limiting it to one per person would be hard to enforce. We're undecided as to whether we'll spend our full day in Yoho hiking the Iceline Trail (or maybe the full Yoho Valley Loop) or if we'll try to hike to Lake Ohara. It would be a day trip from Lake Louise Village, where we are staying. We do enjoy long distance day hikes."
"@Damon, hiking the full Iceline trail (via Little Yoho valley) would be a comparable distance to hiking the fireroad to Lake O’Hara (about 22 km), with more elevation gain on the Iceline (around 700 metres instead of 400m for the O’Hara fireroad ... multiply by 3.28 to convert metres to feet of elevation gain)... but the Iceline has a MUCH better visual pay-off. You start at a higher elevation, and spend much less time hiking in forest. At Lake O’Hara, the really good stuff is the trails that head up once you get to the lake. So unless you are capable of a hiking day of around 30 km (about 18 miles), I think you’d be much better off maximizing your limited hiking time by doing other hikes instead. Besides the hikes at Lake Louise and Moraine Lake (Wenkchemna Pass is a 20ish km day and incredibly scenic), other options that are not too far away are Helen Lake/Cirque Peak, and Molar Pass or North Molar Pass on the Mosquito Creek trail (each of these passes would be about 20 or 22 km, round trip.) These hikes are located on the Icefields Parkway a bit north of Lake Louise. (If I recall correctly, the Mosquito Creek trailhead is 13 km north of LL.) There are also hikes on the east side of the Bow valley from Lake Louise ... I haven’t done these yet so can’t comment. Will be hiking into Skoki Lodge via two passes in August; the area is normally done with overnight hikes, but if you can do the distances, then those longer hikes can be day hikes. It’s 14 km from the trailhead to Skoki Lodge, or 11 km from the ski lodge drop off point for lodge guests, but you could just hike the passes and not all the way to the lodge. Can’t comment on the Yoho Pass hike ... still on my “to do” list. :)"
"HiI was unlucky with my application in the random selection bus lottery. Yesterday following the deadline for allocated seats to be reserved there were seats showing as available but could not be booked.I emailed Parks Canada and was told they do not know when they will be released and available to book. Today when I looked they have all gone off the system. None are available.Were they released today and I missed it? I know the chances would be very, very slim but just wondered if anyone knew so I can move on and just accept we won’t be able to visit Lake O’Hara in September.Thank you."
"It could have something to do with Covid-19, buses might not be even be running. Perhaps ParksCanada is erring on the side Of wait and see.Hopefully this will be over before the summer but who knows.Edited: 6:04 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"I also contacted parks Canada in early March, as dozens of dates were showing available but unable to be purchased. I was told they could be released at any time once the staff was done confirming lottery winners. They told me to just check back periodically.I lucked out and purchased a couple bus seats on the 16th. By the time I bought my seats just 5 or so dates were left."
