We are driving from Germany to Rovinj. We will be spending a few days in Rovinj. Is car theft a problem in the area?Thank you.Lisa 
"Like most of Croatia, you will have no problems in Rovinj. I think the only places you may run into Crime would be the larger cities such as Split and Zagreb, but only if you are in the less travelled parts of town. Don't worry."
Thank you. We've booked rooms at a pension and are looking forward to seeing the area.
"Breaking the glass may occur if there is ""invitation"" i.e. when you leave valuables at the back seatThieves do adore stealing high range BMW,Mercedes,Audi and VW Golf.(But it is not as epidemic as in the war time.)"
