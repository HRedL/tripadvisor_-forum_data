"Hi friends,In light of the current world pandemic of Covid-19, I’ve made the heartbreaking choice to cancel my April 14 trip. My main fear is that the virus will spread throughout Los Cabos and as such, the Mexican government may impose a travel ban, leaving us trapped in the country until the virus passes. I’ve seen many people doing the same and canceling their trips until further notice. I can’t think of anyone in their right mind thinking of traveling overseas with the current state of affairs."
"Good Choice, Mexico and Us Border closes at Midnight tonight. https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g152515…"
"I just don’t want to get sick and get stuck there. If you’ve seen the Puerto Vallarta and Cancun forums, some hotels and local businesses have already begun to shut down to curb the spread of Corona virus."
Very true...
PostponeDon't cancel
LOL. I haven’t called Travelocity yet. Why do you think I shouldn’t cancel?
The people of Los Cabos will welcome you back with open arms. They depend on tourism. Plan to go at a safer time. I am going to postpone / reschedule my April trip rather than cancel it completely.
"What was your original travel date, and where are you departing from? Also, may I ask what hotel you we’re booked at? I’m thinking of postponing until late May or June, depending on how this pans out over the next few months."
"I would not travel until fall, but that's just my personal assessment. Late October or November would be good.My late April trip had lodging in three different places as we had planned to travel around both the Los Cabos and La Paz municipalities. I have not yet rescheduled as I am waiting while the booking companies & hotels reschedule all their March guests."
I have a hotel reservation in late April and another in late May.Not cancelling them yet makes me feel better...
"Ok. So there’s many others in the same boat as me. Travelocity is assisting people with immediate trips within the next 72 hours only, as per company policy for the current events. A lot could change in the next few weeks (either improve or worsen). With that being said, I’m continuously monitoring the Alaska Airlines website for any updates and Pueblo Bonito, where I have my original reservation. Alaska’s chat rep informed me that flights to Mexico are still being completed without any interruption as of current. Since I booked through Travelocity, I want to go through them first to re-book. Either way, this will be a waiting game for me for the next few weeks until I can make any changes. I’ll keep everyone posted, but also feel free to share your thoughts or future travel changes/plans. Cheers,"
"Hi Jen,My wife and I re-scheduled our Cabo trip (5-5 to 5-14 at Pueblo Bonito Banco) to 10-21 to 10-30. While the travel restrictions might be lifted in May there is just so much uncertainty now. I really don’t need 6 weeks of anxiety not knowing if things will get better. Rescheduling for late October relieves that stress and gives me something to look forward to. And if this virus is still a problem in the fall we all will have a lot more to think about then drinking tequila in Cabo. But having said all this I feel your pain. Stay well!!!"
"Good call to delay your trip. I’d rather be at home, rather than in a different country, during a time of crisis. I’m not booked to go to Mexico until June. I’ll wait until May to make a decision regarding postponing. If I do postpone, I am hoping for August since I have another trip to Mexico booked for October."

"I canceled instead of postpone. In my situation there was no benefit in not canceling. My plane ticket is credit good for one year on Alaska. My apartment was kindly refunded in full by my landlord.Of course I will book again once we get through all this, but for my situation a cancellation just made more sense than a postponement."
Has anyone booked through Travelocity or Expedia? You can’t change anything with them until 72 hours until departure. I also called Pueblo Bonito Sunset and they’re telling me to call them 72 hours before the scheduled arrival. I’m guessing most of you booked independently without a 3rd party booking agency.

"Jenn...For my upcoming trips, I have booked hotel and air separately. I had a bad experience years ago with a 3rd party vendor. I lost a lot of money when I had a trip to New Orleans booked when Hurricane Katrina hit. For your future reference, I’ve found that most resorts will match or beat the prices offered by 3rd party vendors. Air is usually competitive or slightly more, but I’ve found it’s worth it to pay a bit more in order to deal directly with the airline or hotel when an issue arises."
"Hi RU-OK-2,Your suggestion is definitely something I’m willing to consider in the future. I noticed resorts like Riu Baja California offering air and hotel packages at competitive prices. I’ll look into them next time.As for my current dilemma, unfortunately I can’t be helped by Travelocity until 72 before my flight. So, with this being said, I suspect it’s the company’s strategy to complete one of two scenarios.  Scenario 1: Prioritizing the travelers with immediate travel, to ensure the channels are open to them only and the lines don’t become clogged with trigger-happy cancellationsAnd/Or:2) Wanting to hold off on cancellations/changes to the very last minute to ensure they can’t cling on to their revenue for as long as possible. Since I just want to re-schedule at this point, I’m not so much concerned with a full refund being processed as I am with being able to get new travel dates.The entire state of affairs could change in 3 weeks. FYI- I checked SFO and SJC airport tracker and flights heading to Los Cabos are operating as normal today."
"Jenn-Reposting this from a different thread. I was able to reschedule a non-refundable 3rd party booking at Pueblo Bonito. Good luck.There seem to be a couple of different Pueblo Bonito 800 numbers. If you call 800-219-2727 you won’t get very far , I believe that goes to their reservation personnel in the US. That number is basically a line where they are taking information to call you back. I tried this twice a few days ago and they don’t get back to you. They probably can’t because they are so swamped with calls. Remember the US State Dep. issued a blanket level 4 international travel warning and they have 9 properties impacted. But I did get through to another number 800-990-8250 which I believe goes straight to Mexico, and I successfully re-booked my non-refundable reservations. I should add that this was hours before the State Dept. issued the travel warning so you may have a harder time, I but try what I am suggesting.Edited: 6:14 pm, March 21, 2020 "
I believe that the 800-990-8250 number goes to PB Reservations in Tijuana. They are closed on Sunday and lightly staffed during the crisis.
"I called that number earlier. I was informed by an agent to call back on Monday so they can assist me. I’m not worried, I can call them and if to no avail, Travelocity within 72 hours of my trip time.If none of those work, chargeback due to COVID-19 and non-cooperation of merchant."
"UPDATE 3/22: I was able to successfully cancel my trip through Travelocity today (there was an auto-cancel option that lets you enter your itinerary number). I was able to get a refund on my non-refundable hotel (PBSB, which by the way, deleted my IG post asking if their resort was closing), as well as airline credits from Alaska.This is a mass pandemic and special case in which the 3rd party booking agencies are allowing refunds.I’ll wait until things simmer down before traveling to Cabo and probably not rebook Sunset Beach as they were not the least bit helpful with my questions."
"I was in Cabo the week of March 9th, had a great time, it was the first week of Spring Break (didn't know), if it wasn't for the college students it would have been a slow week. I switched hotels since I was originally on Medano Beach and had no sleep for two days because of the sb noise. Ended up at Pueblo Bonito Sunset Pacifica and was upgraded to a one bed suite with full views of the Ocean, pool, it was so nice and I was so grateful for the beautiful accommodations and sleep. It's an adult only resort on the Pacific side and they have shuttles to their sister properties. If you just want to relax, have nice meals, yoga on the beach, peace and quiet, I highly recommend this property. I love the locals, always tipped extra since they DON'T make much money, especially important if you're on an AI plan at the hotels. They greatly deserve and appreciate the extra tips. Please be safe, present, kind to one another and let""s try to pay forward during this CV nightmare, praying for all and hoping this will pass soon. Safe travels on your future adventure! Peace and love from Cali"
"Jewels,Were you at Pueblo Bonito Sunset Beach or the Pacifica?I may rebook Sunset Beach, but I’m deciding between that and Secrets in San Jose."
Just think ahead and ask your travel agent to carry your deposit to next year. You will then have something to look forward to and at the same time keep your deposit. Wishing you health and happiness for the future from London.
"As the Covid-19 situation is evolving worldwide, Los Cabos will continue monitoring the outbreak and keep all travelers informed as of when all traveling activities will return to normal. While we cannot give a concrete timeline, all non-essential businesses are currently closed and will be through April 30th. Los Cabos’ state and local authorities will continue to work jointly to strengthen the destination’s health and security protocols in order to contain the spread of the virus. The health and safety of our community and visitors is our utmost priority. We plan to share updates as we get them"
Just cancelled my April 26-May 24th trip to VDA. Rebooking for 2nd week in October
Tes we did postpone our Holiday to October as they let us carry our deposit over. Thank youKeep safe.
Coming in hot May 3rd. It's Cabo time!
"The bars, restaurants, and beaches will most likely still be closed at that time. Good luck with that! What don't you understand about ""essential travel"" and "" social distancing""? Let's stop the spread, be smart, so we can get back to normal. I, for one, would love to get back to normal!!"

No need for refund. We own the properties

"#33 They’re going to be out of those cold Coronas by then, and everything liquid."
Cabo is opening up May 1st. It's Cabo time
"PROV1_ASU.........Dont bet the Ranch on Cabo being open in MAY. That is wishful thinking. Cabo resorts/restaurants being closed thru April does NOT mean they will be Open in May. This is an ongoing problem the Mexican Govt will continue to monitor and make adjustments while they try to control COVID-19 from spreading even more.Its wonderful to have a positive attitude. But keeping our heads in the sand will not change reality.Be smart, stay safe, good luck.Edited: 2:55 pm, April 07, 2020 "
