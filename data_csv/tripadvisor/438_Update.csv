Any information available about the progress of Morocco opening back up?
"Too early to determine. When there is news it will be posted on the 'Covid-19 Master Thread' at https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g293â€¦Edited: 5:02 pm, May 27, 2020 "
"Interesting you say it is early. Most of the world seems to be in some stage of opening, or at least publicly discussing options.Edited: 5:23 pm, May 27, 2020 "
Most people expected Morocco would start to ease lockdown at the end of Ramadan (which finished last weekend) but instead the government announced an extension until June 10thSo I assume we will hear something about plans to open up again in first week of June.
I watch the country of Panama. They remain locked tight but are now talking. Men can go out 2 hours a day 3 times a week and the women same on opposite days.
