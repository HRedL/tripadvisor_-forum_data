"Apologies for the slightly insensitive term in the subject title, but there's an interesting opinion piece on BBC News suggesting (in the UK at least) that deaths from Covid-19 have dropped significantly due in part to the the initial spike in infections being amongst those most vulnerable:BBC News - Coronavirus: Why are deaths falling as cases rise?https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-53951764"
"'Has Coronavirus..', not 'Is...'.Damn autocorrect!"
"Interesting stuff. I think it might also be time to consider the ""exhaustion"" effect when allied to medical evidence. Exhaustion at the lockdown, the restrictions and the politicising of a virus (how weird is that!!!) and exhaustion at coming on this forum to see the same people spewing the same bile every day ( and many times a day).Suspect the article is only viewable in the UK. If anyone cannot read this report, please let me know and I will try to cut and paste it."
I read the article here in Kansas City. The link works. Interesting piece.

They are knocking off the old and weak here in the US to free up some of the social security money. That is fake news.... I made that up
"Yes, thats how Boomer Remover works..."
Of course it might also depend on how the virus mutates.The Spanish flu epidemic took its biggest toll on its second wave.
"My personal unqualified opinion is that a significant number of the deaths in the early days were those who were elderly and/or had underlying medical conditions - I recall some UK Gov body saying around 80% of those who died had 1 or more underlying conditions. It was no surprise to me that in the UK the virus raged through care homes.I believe that covid19 is here to stay as a human disease but we will come to treat it in the same way as flu - there will be treatments that lessen it's impact, possibly a vaccine and unfortunately some people will die but that is no different from flu or any other condition.Society cannot continue indefinitely with lockdowns or the cure becomes worse than the illness.I do not mean to devalue those who have lost their lives or the impact on those affected"
"The data from Milwaukee County really shows the relative risks. I'm using this because the health department has extremely accurate data available.People 20-29 had the largest number of cases at 5.7 thousand, but only 6 deaths.People 80+ had only 830 cases, but 154 deaths.19 and under 3.4 thousand cases and zero deaths.https:/…"
"I mean this is commonsense. Any respiratory virus is going to kill the elderly in much greater numbers. That is why locking down entire nations was stupid. If we simply offered monetary assistance to anyone over a certain age who agreed to voluntarily quarantine themselves, didn't dump COVID infected patients in nursing homes, things would be a lot better right now. There had better be a vaccine soon, people think wearing a mask in the summer sucks. Try it in December or January in places like NYC, Chicago, Toronto. The mask will become in some parts frozen, then melt, then refreeze when you go in and out of the cold. All those nasty germs and viruses people are so scared of will permeate that thing and there will be many many sick people."
"""The mask will become in some parts frozen, then melt, then refreeze when you go in and out of the cold. All those nasty germs and viruses people are so scared of will permeate that thing and there will be many many sick people.""Any science to back up your statement? Many masks have a melt blown middle layer. Shouldn't effect what passes thru."
"What you aren't getting Big is that COVID is 0.12 microns. Surgical masks filter down to about 1-3 microns. When masks get wet permeability gets significantly greater. Any decent doctor would tell you that. That is why operating rooms are kept cool not cold, with extra oxygen pumped in. You don't want the mask to be damp. If it is, it has to be replaced. It's bad enough in warm climates, in freezing ones this will be a massive health hazard. You think the flu and colds are bad normally, just wait. And no, I'm not going to pull together research for you. I'm not paid to be anyone's teacher. No one is saying this, I am. Making sure you know where you heard this first."
"@Post #10 - ""There had better be a vaccine soon, ""The report of a COVID reinfection (25-year old man in Reno). https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…The reinfection is a genetically-different strain of the coronavirus, which brings the effectiveness of a vaccine into doubt. The reinfection seems to have been worse than the original infection.There are still too many unknowns with this pandemic to make judgements other than keep your guard up against it."
"^^^agree.Plus, there is a vocal and growing anti vax movement among the far right (the P and Q crowd---patriots and Q's) who view the vaccine as an evil Global Order attempt to microchip the world by disguising it as part of a fake virus. It's all Soros/Fauci/Gates' fault.And remember...45 said these people like him (so they will vote for him?). If so, why is he pushing for a vaccine/therapeutic so adamantly? It may turn some of his base against him, Oh well..."
"There was a news that says 100,000 senior home residents died, when total death was 128,000. This gives you an idea of ratio. Not to insensitive, if you ever visited senior homes. death often is freedom, liberation, Joy. Death is not sad, living is sad."
"Dont be so sure...the Chinese only want fit, healty young workers, They don't want the old, the ill, the disabled consuming their resources and not producing for the good of the country.. Then all of a sudden along comes a virus which just happens to get rid of such people."
"""The Chinese virus has always been about the elderly and vulnerable""No. Deaths from the virus maybe, but not the virus in general. 15% of cases are critical. Death is not the only possible bad scenario. Lung damage, kidney damage, heart damage...do you want any of those? And we don't know what mutations will come along, or what this virus can do long term. Does it remain in our system and then resurface years later like chickenpox? Or worse? Is it not affecting children with short-term symptoms, but doing some long-term damage that we don't even know about yet? Brushing it off as something that only harms the elderly or immune-compromised is certainly ignorant. And amputations are never much fun: https:/…"
"Another reason deaths have gone down is the medical community evolved over the months on how to treat an infected patient. This information was shared freely. There was no blue or red states, or global entity blocking this information."
"It has been reported many times and by CDC, the Coronavirus in Europe and US are European Coronavirus, not the Chinese virus, different types.They admitted the mistake was they kept watch on virus from China, but missed the real big threat came from Europe."
"@kitty, “ Plus, there is a vocal and growing anti vax movement among the far right”I’ll state again, that the majority of anti-vaxers I know are liberals. But, according to some, it’s closer than most realize. “ In 2015, the Pew Research Center conducted a survey of 2 thousand adults which concluded about 12 percent of liberals and 10 percent of conservatives believed that childhood vaccines are unsafe.”“While Trump administration health officials and most Republicans in Congress still back mandatory vaccination, opposition is gaining steam among Republicans in state legislatures.”https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/27/an…13"
"ttum, here is but one of many stories on many alt right websites about the 'fake virus' and 'fake vaccine'.Before you scoff at the source, 45 does follow Alex Jones. So do many Q people. And so do many sovereign citizen/militia/prepper/patriot groups. Yes, there are trolls too.And me? There are those of us who read the whole spectrum of news to stay informed. I would advise you to do the same. Please do read through the comments on this story and others here. They are disconcerting and talk about violence...even if meant 'in fun' (like one comment elsewhere that called for storming an NBA game and...taking care of the players. )But these folks LIKE 45, or so he has heard. And that means they'll VOTE for him?https:/…Edited: 4:39 pm, August 29, 2020 "
"kitty, “And me? There are those of us who read the whole spectrum of news to stay informed. I would advise you to do the same.”It’s a shame to assume that someone only gathers their news from one side of the spectrum. Now, I do realize a lot of folks are like that, but if you’ve read my posts, which I know you have, you’d know I’m not a hardcore conservative or “Trumper” as my old pal DTC likes to claim. I’m a proud American, and want what is best for our country, just as I assume you do. Perhaps you should realize that just because someone posts a news story from a place you don’t approve of, doesn’t mean they only use that and other sources like it for news. I agree with you, and I do the same...I gather my news from various different sources. 13Edited: 5:12 pm, August 29, 2020 "

I suggest we keep in mind TomMalley’s comment in post #17 “Lung damage, kidney damage, heart damage...do you want any of those?”==>> It is becoming clearer by the day that just because you’ve had a relatively mild case of Covid-19, that does not mean that your concerns are over!!This from a recent Washington Post article, “Health experts worry coronavirus could cause lasting heart complications for athletes” should concern all of us, no matter our age, https:/… . The article points out that in a recent study from Germany, “Researchers gave 100 patients who had recovered from covid-19, two-thirds of whom had suffered mild or no symptoms, cardiac MRI exams. The tests showed 78 percent had some kind of cardiac abnormality, and 60 percent showed inflammation consistent with myocarditis. The study was composed of middle-aged people, and Emery said he would expect athletes as a group to fare better. But the results — that people with mild symptoms could suffer heart complications as a result of covid-19 — still startled him and his colleagues.”Young people who survive Covid infections, but who subsequently end up with longterm complications, will form a new generation of people with “pre-existing conditions” at a much younger age than those who have until now been at risk from dying due to Covid.Don’t underestimate the risk! Continue washing your hands and maintaining social distances, as well as wearing a mask!"
"15 writes ""if you ever visited senior homes, death is often freedom, librration, joy""count to three count to three 1 2 3Phew. Based on your ""enlightening"" view , one can deduce it is good, right for people to pray for someone's death. Joy would be achieved!"
"""There was news that said 100,000 died"". That's your standard now? ""There was news""? You sound more like DJT every day.

"too much logic for crazies to handlethe number of morons on social media who blamed people not wearing masks for their 60 yo+ relatives who got covid after going wherever is astounding...no way people in those demos got seriously ill because they were quite literally 1000% more likely to develop serious symptoms, right?these crazies have zero ability to think or read. they let their favorite clickbait media personalitiezzzz and politicianzzzz do all of their thinking for them."
"""people in those demos got seriously ill because they were quite literally 1000% more likely to develop serious symptoms""So how come in didn't happen to those people in the same demo who live in Japan?"
No.The low-hanging fruit is just being better protected. For now.
Jam:Thanks for the article. Here in Canada the ratio of deaths in LTC vs total was even worse.We have the kids going back to school next week and folks need to be prepared for little “outbreaks”. Not sure about the UK but here the impact of several months without cancer screening and a large backlog for surgery is at crisis level. The economy has not recovered. I believe though that our politicians are paralyzed. Each new stage of opening was greeted with fewer incidences of Covid somehow yet our leadership is invisible. It’s time here at least to move forward.
"#31 “... yet our leadership is invisible.”Exactly what planet do you live on? LOLI live right in Toronto, just got home from driving around for hours, dropping off school supplies and book donations, during which time I listened to snippets from earlier this morning of PM Trudeau’s press conference, as well as Premier Ford, Mayor Tory, and Dr DeVilla (MOH for Toronto) all giving updates on plans for the immediate future, and into the Spring, as well as advice on remaining vigilant, how to protect ourselves, keep each other safer, all in an effort to minimize cases until a vaccine is available, which they agreed would not be before Spring 2021!The words safer, vigilant, minimize, etc were used because they know that “outbreaks” WILL occur but the size of the outbreak (a second major wave, multiple small waves, or a consistent occurrence of low numbers of new cases) will depend on everyone’s efforts, not just theirs! This has been a world wide pandemic, no one knew what to expect or what to do early on, and the focus in Canada—rightly or wrongly—was on protecting the health care system to avoid a collapse like in Milan or NYC, while buying time to develop better approaches to treatment, more effective medications, and hopefully a working vaccine. **As much as we would all like it to be, this pandemic isn’t over yet! How well we do, doesn’t just depend on the politicians...it depends on you, me, all of us! The same applies everywhere.**It may not be specific to your area, but anyone interested in reading today’s statement from Toronto’s Medical Officer of Health can access it in full here, https:/…8e7c-MOH-Statement_31August2020.pdf , you all might learn something useful ;-) She mentioned the University of Minnesota in her comments so I just looked at their website; here is a link to their “Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Resource Center” page, https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19 . I noticed there’s a podcast mentioned there, which I haven’t listened to yet, that discusses “the impact that Sturgis and students returning to higher education might have on case numbers in the US, the critical need for quality and transparent regulatory science, and the first confirmed cases of reinfection with COVID-19.” [ if anyone is interested :D ]In the meantime, here is a small excerpt of the MOH’s statement: “I’m saying it again because it can’t be said enough: Everything that we do at Toronto Public Health to keep you safer depends on your actions in your daily lives. So in the many months ahead, please:--Build one bubble and protect it. For now, a bubble is made of ten people, not many bubbles involving those ten people.--Please get a flu shot. This year more than any.--Please avoid crowds, closed spaces and close contact with people outside your bubble.--And always: wash your hands often, watch your distance and wear your mask.You may be tired of hearing me say wash your hands, watch your distance and wear your mask – but please don’t get tired of doing these things. These are the things we must resolve to do every minute of every day, until we can gather as we used to and think only about how much we're enjoying ourselves. And working together, I believe we will see that day!”To paraphrase Gandhi, be the change you want to see in the world!Be safe and stay healthy."
"Blue... Actually the number of deaths are under counted. And exactly who is ""almost everyone?"".. Are you channeling donald again?"
Delta wing:Gee...”what planet do I live on”. I read your lengthy diatribe but don’t see it’s relevance. At present your premier has been on a barn storming session for a few weeks. Mayor of Toronto is a low level politician. Public health are bureaucrats that have provided little meaningful analysis in my opinion. PM seems to have his handful with the corruption allegations. In the beginning they were visible when it came to meeting out restrictions and then lifting a few. I maintain we could be moving ahead with further careful restriction lifting. As I said there will be - in the opinion of some experts- some small outbreaks in the schools. Still reopening the schools has been successful elsewhere in the world. It’s time to move forward.
"Perhaps I don’t understand what you mean, or why you infer that we are not moving forward.Schools in Ontario traditionally open the day after Labour Day; this year that date is September 8th. Schools ARE set to re-open that day, although there is some leeway stated within the guidelines, and protocols are being established for dealing with new suspected cases. As far as I am aware, any resistance is coming from teachers and some parents, not the politicians.Edited: 1:08 am, today "
"Maybe teachers and parents are worried about groups of a thousand plus gathering together? Hmm, wonder why?"
Our classes are not THAT large ;-)
