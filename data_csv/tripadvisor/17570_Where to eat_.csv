"Well, I eat in Fairbanks quite a bit - here are some of my favorites: I do like Pike's landing by the way - and they have a fabulous Sunday brunch if you are around then and I have enjoyed a few dinners there as well - they are just a short drive/long walk from the Princess for you. I enjoy Lavelle's - and they have probably the largest wine selection in Fairbanks. (downtown area) Try the Turtle Club (though this would be hard w/o a car, as they are located in Fox) - they are known for prime rib and seafood. As well, I like Gambardella's Pastabella for Italian (also downtown), the Lemongrass for Thai - not too far from the Princess. Many places will offer several varieties of fish . . . no need to eat it fried! Well, I am sure I have missed a few . . . these are the first that came to mind. Hopefully, our Fairbanks expert will give you some more suggestions. :)"
Those are the ones I would suggest too. Chena Pump is a bit more expensive then Pikes. Have fun.
"We had lunch at The Pump House-sat out on the deck--a gorgeous spot. We saw the Paddle Wheeler go by plus two float planes take off. A mama duck with her 10 babies floated by. The houses across the river are gorgeous. The food was great--we got the buffet--great selection and everything was delicious. This is a very historic place--enjoy the beautiful flowers , food and think of us!!!!"
"We had no mosquitos at the Pump House--just a nice sunny day, breeze and beautiful scenery to enjoy a relaxing lunch."
"Hi RedRox,I had to chuckle regarding your comment of ""weightwatchers meeting gone bad"""". Being a Registered Dietitian, I'm cognizant of the menu fare that is offered at restaurants. Many people feel that since they are on vacation, they can really let loose. However, becoming sluggish following a high fat and caloric meal doesn't make for a memorable sightseeing trip (lol).And speaking of sightseeing trips, I visited Sedona a few years ago. What beautiful country. I was tickled everytime a rock formation's identity was revealed (Bach, Snoopy, Madonna, just to name a few:-)You should write a trip report on your Alaskan adventure if you get a chance. It would be nice to read, and helpful for many."
Thanks. I'll be sure to read your reviews.And congtats and best of luck with your heart healthy regimen. It's not an easy task...and more eateries should be mindful of our nation's epidemic. lol
"RedRox: I just wanted to let you know that I had read your post. I am still chucking over the ""weight watchers"" comment . . . glad you retained your sense of humor through out your trip! I would have had a heart attack just paying that cab bill - no wonder the cabbie recommended the Turtle club for you. ;)Congrats on your improved health, a good trip up North here, and sharing with us on the forum. It's appreciated. :)"
"I know it is a little late, but Fairbanks has some fantastic authentic Thai restaurants (8-9 of them!), run by Thai people. Also recommend the new Silver Gulch Brewery restaurant for burgers, etc, it is located in Fox."
