Are Fly365 reliable? Any bad experiences with the booking?
book direct to the airline. do not pass thru third party resalers.
"Just booked international flight with them. Simple user interface, Good customer service and will they will help you add any frequent flyer you have. Significantly cheaper too"
Arvin where exactly does FLY365 get these 'cheap' air fares from? Please come back and tell us about your amazing trip when you return (or are you going to be another 1 post wonder?).
"Booked with them, no problems at all.Only a bit strange that they ask a confirmation of your payment, but flight was all good."
"Just booked a one-way Virgin Australia flight with these guys, Melbourne to London. The website wasn't working but just booked it over the phone with the incredibly helpful customer service operator. Would highly recommend this site if you're looking for budget deals, and if you have any doubts would recommend just calling them and doing it over the phone."
One post wonders. Gotta love it.

"Oh well, why not book with a 3rd party agent, and take your chances?I mean, many fly to Las Vegas, and gamble away all of their money, so why not do it from home?Good luck,Hunt"
"After fake news, fake posts. Nothing new.http://whois.domaintools.com/fly365.comhttps://online.omegatravel.net/company.htmlhttps:/…sagitta-travel-agency-limitedLooks to me like a shonky."
Booked with fly365 for the second time. Writing a review as dealing with them has been a pleasure. First trip was Sydney-India - Bangkok - Siem Reap - Sydney. Second one is Uk & Europe. made a mistake in the booking and was fixed without issues and their response time with emails is great.
"Post #5 ""Just booked a one-way Virgin Australia flight with these guys, Melbourne to London""Considering Virgin Aust doesn't fly to London from Aust, your story is quiet unbelievable.If your going to be a company shrill, at least get your spam correct."
Post #12 - Virgin has a code share with Etihad.Virgin Australia VA7060 - Mel to AUHVirgin Australia VA7019 - AUH to LHRAtleast do some research before commenting.
Looks fine to me …etbtravelnews.global/307451/…
"Post #13 ""Virgin has a code share with Etihad""So I'm correct, as you didn't fly Virgin to London, you flew code share with Etihad.. Not exactly sure what your spammy post is about, but your not fooling anyone. You would expect a company shrill to have the knowlodge of who flies what to where. Even more reason not to book through your shonky pack of lies company."
"www.productreview.com.au/p/fly365-com.htmlSo many fake reviews, that even blind freddy can tell how dodgy this company is (if your going to do fake reviews, at least get different ppl to write them, as every single glowing reviews is written in the same format. The ones that are not glowing reviews are completely different, so easy to tell it's not just one person been a shrill)."
What about the link I put up....not a TripAdvisor review.
"That link is regurgitation of a press blurb from Fly365 by a lazy journo. It does not even touch on any accuracy, service or reliability issues by this mob."
So you don't think they are good ? Interested as I'm wanting yo book and these came up as cheapest. Do you have proof they are no good ?
"Ive just booked 2 business class airfares from Melbourne to Sri Lanka via Bangkok, flying Thai. Fly365 was (a) $400 cheaper than booking direct with Thai and (b) the whole online process was faultless. The eTicket was issued promptly via a operate portal and the booking confirmation tied in direct to the Thai website. We are vacationing with a group of friends, 4 of which also booked with Fly365 and they had same experience."
Thanks Mike. I hope you have a wonderful holiday.
"I know i'm a fresh account - just wanted to comment on this to hopefully give some others peace of mind. I was a bit leery of booking on their website personally, as on productreview they seem to have a whole heap of shill reviews, and i see some high post count members here saying the same thing. Rang flight centre, asked for the price beat, no problem. They found the flight (BNE-BKK-SGN-BNE) and were able to ""beat it by a dollar per person"" as expected. Initially they hung up on me while i was on hold, happened to get the same guy when i rang back and he said ""oops sorry call mustve dropped, i am unable to beat the flight on the last leg though, bkk to bne?"" i'm like ""nah sgn to bne"" he's like ""oh ok"" then he beat it by a dollar.The price on Thai Airways' website was $840 per person, fly365.com had it at $716.53 and flight centre obviously came in at $715.If flight centre is cool to match them i'm guessing they're fairly legit?"
Airlines don't give discounts like that to third party sites. The best peace of mind comes from booking without using a middleman. By getting confirmed prices before you pay. By having the flexibility of dealing with the airline yourself for changes or interruptions.
"I don't know what youre on about man, I price beat with flight centre, a.k.a.the biggest travel company in Australia, there isn't any more peace of mind than that."
"And you regard that as creditability? FC has very little of that to start with so at least you are comparing apples with apples, both less than ideal."
"I don't believe a word your saying GUY, as you cant get a price beat over the phone as it must be in writing at an actual travel agent.Again, if your going to be making up lirs Fly365, at least do some research first.And just in case anyway says you don't need it in writing, here's the link from flight centre which stipulates that it does over and over.flightcentre.com.au/lowest-airfare-guarantee"
I'm afraid I can't see much credibility in Guy's posts.
"Wow, it must be so tiring being as unhealthily cynical as you lot. I will happily allow you to chase me away, not interested in being part of a community with such common animosity. With the above said, if you clowns are actually interested in proof, here's a screenshot clearly stating price match and the discount from their fare, also Vietnam mentioned in the visa section. Prices will line up with my earlier post.https://imgur.com/a/q0x12You'll note in my prior post I mentioned he said ""I can't match the return leg"" before I cleared up the route, then he matched it. I imagine if he couldn't match it, he wouldn't have been obliged for me to fly free, as the conditions you mentioned about being printed and in store wasn't met, however as he could match it once he understood the route, he did? Why chase off business, when it's not cheaper than what they can manage?Edited: 3 years ago "
"Being cynical is healthy for our wallets Guy. There are so many horror stories on here of people using OTAs because they saved a few bucks only to end up with all sorts of,problems. A new member singing the praises of an OTA is suspicious. I'm not saying you're a shill, but it does raise warning bells.not that it matters to me whether yiou are a genuine traveller or not as I'm only interested in booking direct with the airline."
"On your first point about a little cynicism being healthy for your wallets,I agree. Its what brought me to this thread.""A new member singing the praises of an OTA is suspicious. I'm not saying you're a shill, but it does raise warning bells.""I'd just like to point out,I no where praised fly365 and I didn't even book with them because as I said, I was cynical of them myself. I used flight centre to price match them. I was only judging by the fact that they were even willing to price match them, that they are more likely to be a legitimate business, or else the travel consultant would have refused to match based on illegitimacy and attempted to make me pay FC's rate."
"That's made things a bit clearer. Thanks, Guy."
"I have not used fly365, but I have certainly booked flights through third party websites, because they offer a better price than directly through the airlines. So I am a cheapskate. I roll my eyes when people blindly recommend always book through airlines directly, as if it is always the best option. You just need to be aware of the potential pitfalls, especially if you may need to change your plans. There may be issues getting hold of someone, plus there may be extra costs involved."
"<<You just need to be aware of the potential pitfalls, .... plus there may be extra costs involved.>>There are plenty of pitfalls. Now look at most complaints here. Great many do not:- understand the difference between skyscanner and an OTA;- understand what it means to appoint an agent and having a layer between them and the airline;- read any T&C's (neither airline, nor OTA);- understand that there will be little to no real customer service when calling an OTA;- understand the difference between flying all segments on one ticket or on separate tickets- understand that indirect flight cost less than direct flightsNotwithstanding of the total lack of checking with whom they enter into business with before they handing over larger amounts of money.IN SUMMARY:They do not take a balanced risk vs. reward decision but chasing the air fare fairy. And that is the reason why I will continue to recommend to buy directly with the airline.If most people would be aware of the risk (like you pojaya seem to be), then most of the OTA would be out of business. Also, once you make a balanced risk vs. reward decision, you will not come to complain if the risk has actually come through."
"I missed one of my internal flights on an international holiday which subsequently cancelled the rest of my tickets. This was an airline policy (always read the notes) however I wasn't notified by the airline or 365 that my remaining flights had been cancelled. I found out 2 hours before my flight was due to depart so tried to contact fly365 to see if they could help, only option was email as they don't have phone support outside Australian business hours. Received a response hours later saying that my flights had been cancelled due to a no show....no further assistance offered. If you're after any sort of help when you're in a bad situation you won't get much assistance apart from a default response from the FAQ's."
"I wouldn't expect any help at all from a booking site if I failed to show for a flight and the rest of my tickets on that booking were cancelled. That's probably because I know that nothing can be done except for buying new tickets, and I'd go to the ariline for that."
"I actually booked with them, and had a bit of a snag with one of the flights. They were very helpful and tried their best to sort it out with the airline. It still didn't go as planned, so they refunded me some of the $$$, which was something I didn't expect and tbh, I appreciated. I would go with them again, and definitely recommend them."
I'v recently booked a flight through them no problems even got access code to retrieve flight information through singapore airlines which allows me to change seats etc. Very happy with service
"If anyone is worried or has reservations regarding booking through Fly365 or other lesser known third party resellers, do what I did. I used Fly365 to get my flight details and a quote, went to Flight Centre and they matched the price even though Flight Centre was $200 more expensive. All u need to be sure is the quote is on the day you go (print it out and take it with you) into Flight Centre (current). The only extra cost I needed to fork out was the credit card fee (Fly365 had no fees for Mastercard) but that was only and extra $8. Fly365 had the cheapest flights by far (yes I even went directly through the airlines, in this case Emirates). Price matching alleviates some of the apprehension."
"""went to Flight Centre and they matched the price even though Flight Centre was $200 more expensive""So how does that equate to *price match*??????"
"Not sure what u mean there but Fly365 was $1580, Same flights at Flight Centre were $1780. Flight Centre saw my quote from Fly365 and sold me the ticket for that price"
I'm sure I've read complaints about Flight Centre somewhere ;-)
Flight centre refused to price match fly365.com today because it's not an Australian website. Anyone else had this issue?
"They are telling porkies as Fly365 is Aussie and I had no trouble at all, they matched it instantly"
Thanks. I've emailed the TA!
"Yeah they do fly to london, you just have a layover like most airlines..."
"As a relatively new company and one I have not heard of I was very worried about booking with them. We are talking over $5000 worth in flights but after checking reviews I thought I would give them a try. I would like to extend my unconditional gratitude to Dawn for going well and truely beyond the call of duty. You and Amit (I hope I have got the right consultant) helped me out so much yesterday. Not at all happy with the 3rd consultant but you Dawn totally calmed me down and got my flights sorted. As a first time traveller my nerves were fried by yesterday afternoon. I was shaking and in tears by this time and basically had had enough. My last phone call to the office was with a consultant that needs learn some customer service etiquette . When I got off the phone I thought I was done, screwed actually. But two minutes later my phone rang and it was my saviour named Dawn (who had over heard the 3rd consultant being, well totally disrespectful) and 10 minutes later - flights are booked and paid for. Dawn and Amit were 110% professional and bloody awesome in their service to me. Pricing well and truly below anything I could find on any other site. Even through a travel agent or on Web jet and even individual airlines could not compete. I will definitely be refering everyone I know to fly365.com and any future bookings will be through you. Thank you again and because of yesterday I hope Karma smiles down on youEdited: 2 years ago "
"Sounds like you went through a lot of hassle with your booking with Fly365, it certainly wouldn't fill me with confidence and persuade me to book with them."
"SOP for these amazing one time reviewers for all mileage brokers that practice ticket fraud. 1) I was nervous at first - ""As a relatively new company and one I have not heard of I was very worried about booking with them."" - Check2) Name drop the rep and how amazingly helpful they were - ""I would like to extend my unconditional gratitude to Dawn for going well and truely beyond the call of duty.

"<<I hope Karma smiles down on you>>I also wish that they close shop, but...."
"""Thank you again and because of yesterday I hope Karma smiles down on you""=========Seeing as you only booked with them yesterday (and were provided the link to this thread by ""Dawn"", or was it ""Amit"") and haven't flown yet there's a very high chance that Karma will bite you in the back side."
"Why wuld you give more than $5k to a company you;d never heard of and were worried about? What was it about the reviews that convinced you to put your doubts to one side? There are far more questions here than answers, karma or otherwise."

"I have only just learned of fly365 yesterday, so I checked them out. I haven't booked with them because I'm not sure about my holiday dates yet, but see no reason not to. I frankly get a bit tired of the constant 'book direct with the airline' palava ... change the record please! I have booked with numerous online travel agents over the years and never had a problem with any of them - in fact I've booked several times with Bestjet (which doesn't enjoy the best of reviews on TA - but then, what online travel agent does?) and never ever had any problems (even when I had to change my bookings!). I guess if you have access to limitless funds then yes you can book direct with the airlines, but for most of us plebs we try to save money wherever possible and I have made significant savings by booking through an agent. I do my research though, but I'm finding now that information from Tripadviser is becoming less and less reliable."
Please come back to report WHEN eventually your luck runs out.Edited: 2 years ago 
I say this for domestic flights in India. There are many times you book through travel agents viz when you want to encash your payback points for one. Those companies also reward you with points credit to ewallets for bookings made. And in all these bookings the agent uses my email id and mobile number. So in addition to the confirmation from the agent I get a confirmation directly from the airlines. I have also cancelled directly with the airline’s customer service tickets booked through the travel agents. The only flip side is you pay extra fees to the agent for any changes but these are by no means exorbitant and part of t&c.
"Vicki, if you are convinced that you're saving money by using third parties, then please feel free to ignore any and alla dvice to book direct, and continue what you're doing. No one will kin in the slightest, and hopefully you have enough experience and knowledge of how thinsg work to mitigate most of the risks.In the same vein, though, I'll ignore your claims to have made significant savings and I'll continue to book directly, because in my experience there aren't any real savings to be had by booking with OTA's. I don't believe that saving a few pounds is worth the increased danger of something going wrong, nor the added complication of having to deal with a middleman if it does. That's just my opinion, though. Each to their own."
"Hello, I just booked my connected flights Qantas-Qatar-Qatar with fly365 and two my Qatar tickets has already numbered seats , what I do not like. There are worst seats on the plane.It never have been happened with me before, that I receive tickets with booked seats in advance and without possibility to choose the seat. They writtes I can pre-seat with the charge 25$.But usually , you book the seat when you check-in and it is free. Does anybody knows, is it Fly365 did that seats choice instead me, because they wants to charge me still 25$ ?and can I still change seats without paying money ?Thanks :)"
Why do the likes of Skyscanner recommend companies like this?
"Skyscanner don't recommend anyone. They simply display a list of results based on the user's search criteria. I've never, ever, seen Skyscanner or any price comparison site say 'We recommend you book this!' or 'This the third party booking site for you!'."
"I recently needed to cancel flights overseas and I was quoted a refund of $1100 which I confirmed in writing. I later get a phone call at 10pm at night saying I need to check my email because I am only getting $700 back. So what happened was a stuff up in their end, and this manager who called me refused to honour the promised amount. So i proceeded to say With that big difference in refund, I will have to get back to him to decide if I still want my flights cancelled but THEY ALREADY CANCELLED MY FLIGHTS! Zero apology was given, in fact the entire time the manager did not give me much of a chance to speak and he also did not apology or want to own up ti their mistake. The service was scary. I am really sad that we just lost $400 . If youd likr to see email proof of what happened- shoot me an email to Jc_amaro@hotmail.com"
this company is sooooo dodge!!!
"Most agents have abysmal customer service, Shairie. It's just one of the reasons why I much prefer to book directly with the airlines. Their service might not always be fantastic, but at least it's better than what you'll get with the likes of Fly365."
"Flight centre refused to match FLY365 telling me that their fares are not ""live availability"" whatever that means. They also refused to tell me if they would or wouldnt match bestjet or flight network when I asked if they would match these sites. Took two days of constant calling to get any response from them. Such poor service."
"By “live fares,” it means that the quoted fares come from the past, and maybe a long time in the past - they are not real, at that moment.The agent wants folk to pay up front, then they look at real prices, and hope the client forks over more money, rather than loose, what the hav paid.Best of luck,Hunt"
"I have no time for Flight Centre, but in this case they are very likely to be correct as explained by Hunt above."
"Yes, in this case at least, FLight Centre, for all of their faults, are not to blame. Personally, I would not expect or rely on price matching at all."
I've used Fly365 a few times and so far I am happy with the service and the price. Emailed them a few times to extend my trips and got very prompt and professional responses. I would use them again.
"Just book trip to Norway with Fly365.com (not Fly365.com.au). Very good, quick and better flights price than any other agency. No agency fees. No Mastercard fees. Unfortunately, they DO NOT accepting Amex. Highly recommended"
Just checking out flights to Vancouver from Perth ( business class) Fly365 come out over $2000 cheaper using Cathay Pacific / JAL . Air New Zealand cheapest ($7800 ) of all majors. Is piece of mind worth the extra $2000 ? Had intended to book using Fly365 as flight times excellent but after comments here not so sure . Think I will try the Flight Centre route to see if they will match .Edited: 2 years ago 
"I just book my flight with Fly365 to Oslo. So far so good. Very quick and very professional. Previously, I tried to book with other agency, but after several request from them at midnight for copy of driving licence and passport, I was extremely lucky when I got my payment back. All phonecalls come from overseas."
"I am astounded by the sheer childish banter between what I assume are grown adults. I logged on to view some constructive discussions on whether to make an informed decision to book with this company but have come away frustrated because you all cannot review your experiences constructively. Who the hell cares how many tier levels there are as long as you are getting the price that fits your budget. At the end of the day are they good to book with or not, stop all the snide remarks, these are your opinion and should not be forced on others. Unless you all are travel agents, clearly you are not, keep to reviewing your experiences and cut out the snide remarks."
"Ooohhh. Attention all TA Air Travel forum regulars. You have all upset Concorde who apparently does not want your opinions, and obviously cannot be bothered to read the genuine complaints filed against this company among the previous 70 posts, or Google for complaints to be found in other locations on the 'net."
"I booked a return trip last year Sydney to London return flying Thai airways. I emailed and called them a few times as I was a little anxious as I did not know anyone who'd used them can not fault Fly365, customer service was excellent."
Customer service of Fly365 was impolite discourteous and shouting to customer and never accept there fault. How can I book another booking in the same time and same company with you? It confirmed all information from airline both booking came from you and you sent the email that if I didn’t fix it in 2 hr. You will charge me another $200!! Even I try to explain that I did book only 1 booking with you and made a payment to you already but you ask me to pay another $200 more for your mistake? Also customer service strong blame customer for protracted theirself not accepting there fault but blame every problem to customer.
"Fangy, we are NOT Fly365 so you rant above is totally wasted."
"Please just check out with whom you are doing business.Fly365.com is a UAE registered company belonging to Sagitta Travel Group. http://whois.domaintools.com/fly365.comI do not know if there is a link to this company in the UK: https:/…sagitta-travel-agency-ltdOr it belongs to Fly365 ltd.: https:/…-1313026394Based on that, this would be the HQ: http://www.fly365.co.uk/contactOn their website, they give this as the trading name HQ: Head Office: 16/36 Agnes Street Fortitude Valley 4006, QLD, AustraliaHave a look at google at their HQ.If a company tries to hide who they are and where they are based, that to me is a warning sign, a big one.

"I wouldn't call the Qld address residential.https://goo.gl/maps/pinRwgvB5ztFly365 Pty Ltd is registered with the Australia Securities and Investments Commission commencing 25/06/2015 and registered office at Nundah Qld, but that could well be the accountant's office for the company which is quite common."

"Legit Tripadvisor user here - I totally understand the cynicism but I booked a trip to Koh Samui from Sydney with Fly365 in 2017 and rang the phone number out of curiousity to see if it was all legit. I had a lengthy conversation with an Aussie guy (I think it was Scott) that was really nice and he emailed me my eticket for extra certainty. It gave me confidence that they were indeed Aussie-based and were real travel agents. Turned up to the airport and there were absolutely no issues.I literally just booked a bigger trip with them after i saw the prices they were offering on Skyscanner to the European destination I was looking for and my other options were BestJet, STA Travel, Expedia, Opodo. I friggin HATE STA Travel after 2 bad experiences in my twenties where they robbed me blind and then refused to help me when they stuffed up and I called them repeatedly from the other side of the world asking for help and the agent just ignored me for days. Expedia was WAY more expensive and some digging around on the other sites didn't fill me with too much confidence based on reviews etc. After I had a good experience with Fly365 last year, I thought I would give them another crack. Once again, booking was smooth, got a killer deal with Qatar Airlines to Europe in June this year ( it was $500 more expensive on the Qatar Airlines website) and got all my papwerwork in my email. I rang them again just then after I read the weird reviews on here and on Product Review, thinking they had changed policies or they were bought out by another dodgy firm. I rang them and yes, it took some time to get hold of an actual person (13 mins on hold) but I did get through to one and his name was Rafeeq. I asked him if Scott was still around and he matter of factly said that Scott was in the Brisbane HQ but he was based in Dubai. I appreciated the transparency! So their call centre is now based in Dubai but I have him my booking reference number, and he emailed me my eticket while I was on the phone and when I asked for my seat allocations to be done, he did them for me right there and then and they popped up on my e-ticket as I was viewing it. So far, so good!So, just my 2 cents worth. Their online booking portal is efficient and while their staff are based offshore, they were still pretty good. I will update this post if anything changes but fingers crossed this trip goes as smoothly as my Thailand one."
"Most booking siwll go OK even with some of the extremely dodgy sites. The trouble is, when things go wrong it's normally something very serious, whihc causes a lot of hassle and frustraiton, and usually a great deal of expense, too."
"Very impressed with your review of fly365.com. I have been searching for multi city flights for 4 people for August. This group has given me the flights, times and airline I want as well as best price. My hiccup is I have never heard of them. Your review is now giving me the confidence to move forward with a booking. Thanks."
"I’m in Japan currently and they have been incredibly unhelpful. Changing my flight has been made impossibly expensive and cancellation of my flight is $500, which is difficult to swallow when my flight was $670 return. They provide no overseas number and take a long time to reply to emails, and when you ask a specific question they don’t answer it, just quote their incredibly unclear policy over and over"
">> Changing my flight has been made impossibly expensive <<this sounds more related to the fare rules of the ticket you chose rather than a specific agent issueCommonly restricted tickets have a change fee and fare difference, the difference booking through an agent rather than direct is that you have the agent fee on top - this would all have been covered during the booking process... ($100.00 PER PERSON PER CHANGE)"
"I picked up a great price from Fly365 - over $100 cheaper than Flight Centre, Expedia or Cathay Pacific website for a trip to Hong Kong and Israel. Flight Centre then beat it by $1. I felt safer using them as a more trusted source. But be aware that Flight Centre then apply the same conditions as if booked through fly365, including things like significantly higher cancellation and change fees."
<<Flight Centre then beat it by $1>> Seriously?? This is driving the choice for buying a flight ticket?What about quality and with whom you are doing business?
"Phil, to be fair Tony did mention they are a more trusted source, and they are. Though, some of their business practices are...disagreeable, I would much rather use them than any OTA, as Tony has pointed out."
"I think Phil's point is a fair one, too. I would not choose who to book with becaus eof a $1 saving if I thought I would be using a worse company and exposing myself to a higher risk of having issues."
"That's also a fair point. Whatever the reason, FC is much more reliable than any OTA, as I mentioned before, so a lucky break for the poster."
looking to book multiple flights and need some help please.I have booked with Fly 365 and there service was great last trip
"Don’t book with them. They have the worst customer service I’ve seen in my life. I’ve got Mistaken with my my name. I’ve called them, they sent me an email with the procedures to follow. I answered back with the requested information. I didn’t hear back from them. I emailed them and they told me I didn’t pay the fee (I didn’t pay it because no one bother to send me the link to indicate me where to pay) finally I paid and I’m still waiting for someone to get back to me with the my ticket with the amended name.If I would be you. I would definitely go with someone else. This company is a total joke."
The best approach would be to book direct with the airline (most will allow name corrections - fees will vary) adding a go-between in the transaction adds complexityAlso may be worth getting someone else to double check the details before submitting....a simple typo can work out an expensive lesson
+1 for what Carol has said. Especially about a second pair of eyes. I almost always get my wife to take a look at the information I'm putting in. It's much better to do that than pay to sort out a mistake later.
They are crooks.Avoid them by all means!
"i used them to fly to japan and the were fantastic and very helpful.i had made a mistake in the booking ,but they fixed it ASAP.highly recommended.thanks to 365 J.B."
i did the same thing ask for the Manager as he fixed mine up asap
I got the itinerary emailed to me and told to print and bring to the airport. Doesn't look really legit. But I think it's their graphic design. Otherwise the price was good to me. Cheaper by $90 after the Mastercard charge which was $10.32.
Anne have you tried to access your booking on the sirline's website to check everything is ok? Better to do that than rely o blind faith and turning up at the airport.....
"I just booked a flight with them, no problem. I received itinerary in almost an instant and I checked with the airlines website and confirmed booking, and also when you do this, you will need to enter some details. The negative is that Itinerary is non-refundable, seat is already booked in as it is like you've already checked in, but however I got it almost $340 cheaper than booking it direct with the airline's website. I will definitely post again if I have a problem."
Customer service is really bad if you need to organize something with them. Tried changing my flight and they wanted to charge $1200 where I could book the same flight for $600.
cheaper than airline and airline would not match
"I tried for 2 days. Seems that the instant I found a flight and clicked to buy, it was no longer available. Every single time.I gave up."
That sounds quite normal to me when it comes to dodgy booking site that don't advertise live prices.
Ok...so Melbourne to Bali - Malindo air - Fly365 are about $100 cheaper than booking direct....Are they legit?!?
Have you read the thread?
"Terrible customer service - they said that their office is open from 9 to 5 o'clock but when you call them nobody ever answers the phone and they say their ""office is now closed"" so how do you get in touch with them !!!"
Terrible customer service nobody ever answers the phone even though they say that their office hours are from 9 to 5 but when you call them it says that the office is now closed so how the hell do you get in touch with them
Fly365 is great at taking your money but don't try to contact them by phone or email or ask them to fix a problem.I booked 2 tickets on the same booking for my wife and I traveling to Singapore. Fly365 did not bother to inform us that we could not travel together when I booked the ticket 2 months before traveling. They would not try to fix the problem on the return flight. I fly every month for work but never again will I book via Fly365.
"You are wise to avoid Fly365 in my view, but why could you not travel together?"
Because Fly365 did not realise we were together.Same surname and same booking No. is not enough of a clue.They don't care as long as you pay.
"I'm still unclear, sorry. DId you fly on the same aircraft but in separate seats? If so, was that because of the policies of the airline, or did Fly365 mess up somehow?Or did you have to take a different flight from your partner?"
"We had the same flight but were issued different seat locations.When I complained it fell on deaf ears. That was in business class, at the back of the plain they would probably just cancel your flight. The staff were totally ignorant.I fly Garuda every month to Jakarta and get perfect service and very pleasant staff."
"Maybe there were no other seats available? On the other hand, they are a crappy company and it wouldn't surprise me at all if they managed to mess things up."
"In late 2017, I booked 4 tickets on a complex all around the world trip for my family with several stops and starts. Absolutely no problems whatsoever. It was about $1,000 aus cheaper than my extensive searches through other sites."
"Whist searching for cheap flights I came across FLY365.I read several reviews. The reviews were quite mixed and ranged from “excellent” to “terrible”.I will recount my positive experience.I needed to book a flight quickly. I found that some web sites would not allow bookings that were less than 72 hours ahead. The flights I wanted were less than 72 hours ahead. I telephones Flyabroad. A heavily accented assistance said he could not book via the telephone and confirmed their web site would not book the flights I wanted. I telephoned Fly365 and again a heavily accented assistant replied. He confirmed the web site 72 hour limit but I should “try and see what happens.” I was very apprehensive. Would the web site take my money but not issue a ticket? Would the ticket arrive, via email, on time? I did the booking. The money went out of my account immediately. I held my breath.Minutes later an email arrived from Fly365 with their booking reference. About ½ hour later E tickets arrived with airline booking references. I checked on the airline web sites and my bookings were in the systems.Everything went smoothly and efficiently. I did not have to contact fly Fly365 to alter details or make amendments so I am unable to comment on that side of their services.I am very happy with my experience booking with Fly365 and will use them again."
In the game of Russian roulette there are five empty chambers.
"Months ago I booked through Fly 365 since they offered the shortest route Canberra to San Diego with short stop overs in Melbourne and Tokyo. I usually drive to Sydney and take a direct flight to LA from there., but the short transit in Melbourne was tempting so I took it. Few weeks later my booking was processed and I received confirmation. Months later and just weeks before departure I got an email message that layover time in Melbourne was too short and the airlines requested that it’s changed to 4 hours instead of 2 . 4 hours is too long and tiring to wait in Melbourne airport after 22 hours of flying from LA with one stopover in Tokyo.I was not impressed but asked if the connecting flight Melbourne to Canberra can be changed to the next day The response was yes but I have to pay 650 dollars fees from airlines Tax and Fly365! I felt like prey all want to make money out of including Fly356 ! WhaaatNew Fare Difference: $250.00 New Tax Difference: $55.00 Airline Rebooking Fee: $200.00Fly365 Fee: $135.00Total Per Adult: $ 640.00!!! I asked why Fly 365 charging fees ? When they understand the situation but they would not budge BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU BOOK YOU MAY NOT GET WHAT YOU BARGAINED FOR !Bad service and attitude"

">> .I have been diagnosed with a medical condition and told I am unfit to fly by a Specialist <<unless you have bought refundable tickets, the usual approach to this situation would be to deal with your travel insurance.>> Given the circumstances I would have hoped that Fly 365 would have showed more leniency in this situation as it is out of my control. <<and also out of theirs which is where insurance comes in to playDid you purchase travel insurance?"
"The misquote you fare and tax differences to make more money . Got a cheap flight through them. Had to change the inbound flight before departure . No route changed , the same bookingclass and fare basis is still available therefor should just be charged the change fees. This was all confirmed by the airline . They are claiming there is a different in fare and taxes that doesn’t exist and each time I ask them to break down those differences (eg. What tax changed) they increase the price and don’t answer my question. Not only is it frustrating but it is also disappointing that I have booked through a company that is unethical and deceitful."
"I would not book with Fly365 again as they may fine if no problems.We had 11 in our travelling party. We had to cancel two in our party 6 months out due to medical reasons, $600 out of pocket each and then another had to cancel 4 months out due to changed circumstances. Another $600 , no service, but just fees. never again. The phone service is not 24 hours."
I agree.
">> We had to cancel two in our party 6 months out due to medical reasons, $600 out of pocket each and then another had to cancel 4 months out due to changed circumstances <<the 2 that cancelled for medical reasons should claim through their travel insurance. The ones that changed their mind will likely get nothing back. I assume the fees you were charged were detailed in the airline fare rules and the T&Cs.Third parties usually sell the cheapest/most restricted tickets. For a large group did you consider booking direct with the airline? often they have group bookings section that may be have been more suitable for your group. The time in advance on flight for cancelling is not really relevant...same charges if you cancel 1 day after booking or 1 day before the flight"
Medical issues are one of the thing sthat travel insurance was created for. It's not up to any airline or any booking agent to cover you against being ill.
"Wow, just wow!I've never seen a customer get taken down so slickly as this.My daughter was refused entry at the start of an international journey this afternoon.She has a middle name.This name was included in her online ticket application, since the form specified that names must appear exactly as per passports, which it had.On her ticket, this middle name was included with her surname, which flagged a discrepancy.Cut to end of story:Fly365 refused to remedy any problem as they have a 6 day alteration policy (not that anything justified amending in the first place!)My daughter is out of pocket thousands of dollars and is forced to buy a replacement emergency ticket.Their help desk also refused to recognise or amend her return flight, since, as policy, that flight is not valid if she doesn't board her outbound flight (weeks earlier!).AND, apparently she will not even be eligible for a minor refund ($300-ish) if she can't prove that she was simply a no-show for boarding her outbound flight!!Lesson learned. Avoid 3rd party booking services at all costs!"
Caesar72How did you get a quote of your flight from fly365?
I have booked through skyscanner with Fly365. They have taken money same day from my account and its been over a week no tickets issued yet and no communication. I booked Singapore airlines return tickets to New delhi.I will call them on Monday for a follow up.Disappointed!!
"I just used them. Booked cheap Emirates flight with them. Arrived back in Australia from Egypt today. Everything went smoothly. No problems. I had immediate email confirmation of booked flights. Real good site. Will use again (just don't make changes with them. I changed on fare but direct with airline itself, as I did an upgrade.)"
"Just booked two tickets to Athens for European summer 2019. Cheapest tickets online. Once they were paid, got the booking code, went to the Emirates site, got their booking reference number and printed out the confirmed tickets. Even added my skyward miles to my Emirates account. The wife did a bit of research and looks like Fly365 might be a subsidiary of Emirates. Bit like Jetstar is to Qantas and Aunt Betty is to Flight Centre. Lets see how it pans out."
"oh, looking at them and wondering if should book with them. Have they responded to you yet?"
"I would steer clear of Fly365. We are having a terrible time trying to get a response in relation to cancelled Malindo air flights to Bali. We booked business and paid up front quite some time ago before the airlines decided to cancel future flights. They make excuses and blame the airline when the airline has emailed to say its up to the Agent to refund. They don’t answer their calls! Recorded message to say call during business hours, which we were doing! I always judge a business on how they respond when there is a problem. Clearly Fly365 are not managing these issues very well. Rude to not follow up. RegardsKeryn & Dudley"
">> They make excuses and blame the airline when the airline has emailed to say its up to the Agent to refund. <<It is up to the agent to refund you, but they will only do that when they receive the funds back from the airline. Has the airline confirmed when they issued a refund to your agent?"
Second time I have booked with them. Am very happy.
I had problems they cancelled my booking citing card concerns but yet debited my card straight away and had the money from my card when they cancelled incurred credit charges for the period between them debiting and then refunding. At least I got a refund only cost me fees.
"you are beautiful ,thank you because i was just about to book thru this w....,thank you i will not now"
"Well done for actually checking out a company before handing your money over. If only more would do the same, half of the shonkies might go bust!"
"Rob, have you used flt365 before.You have a lotto day about them and u are based in UK?"

Does fly365 deal with Qatarflights from melbourn to manchester.
Why on earth would you want to insert a dubious agent between you and QATAR? I’m sure they’ll book a ticket if you request them to do so. You might want to read some of the many complaints on here before you do so.My advice would be book directly with the airline but if you really want to use an agent use a decent reputable one (e.g. Trailfinders)
"They're a bunch of overseas thieves!! They have Australian numbers in each state, but they are all Indians in Dubai (1 call centre in Dubai with multiple AU numbers).We're repeating customers. And we fly quite often, about 5~6 times per year, nationally and internationally for our business.Booked 4 tickets for family trip 2 months ago, wanted to cancel 2 of them, not all of them.This is first time ever for cancelling booking for us due to unforeseen circumstances.Long-term customer, think about how much revenue you guy have made from us all those years!They're asking about 60% of fare I paid as 'Cancellation fee' (adding all sort of charges I'm not familiar with, saying they're not making any money, all airline charges?). Are they joking?They may be cheap but be aware and stay away from them! Never again! The worst customer service ever!"
"They are actually located in Fortitude Valley, Qld and, like most of the shonky ticket floggers, they use call centres in India. It is also worthwhile reflecting that you not only accepted the airline conditions, which include cancellation penalties, but you also agreed to accept the terms and conditions of Fly365 which include fees for services."
"The thing is they told me to go to 'Allianz Travel Insurance' (we added when made booking), Allianz had dedicated team for Fly365, PDS clearly stated that ' Unlimited cover for any cancellation fee/lost deposit', they took time and told me 'it's not covered because of business reason excluded'!They obviously team up together to rip cusomters off! When we add 'insurance', we didn't see any statement or option to choose 'business or personal'?"
"When I mentioned writing review, they also told me they have about 500 great reviews, I went to the website and have a look and read top negative reviews, they kinda laughed and say 'that's just fraction of it'. Well, obviously they don't care and doing nothing to improve when they confront any complaints. when I checked Facebook, they also run Tech company. I suspect they may have generated fake reviews with multiple I.P they generated.It happens a lot for large organisation or in political campaigns.No way they can have 5 stars!"
"As a heavy traveller, I highly recommend 'Expedia'. They actually value long-term customers, way easier to deal with for anything."
"Oh well, many will through bags of $ Down a hole, in hopes of enticing the elusive, and illusive Airfare Fairy, out of her lair.Best of luck in this endeavor,Hunt"
"All these companies are much of a muchness. They locate their support in low wage economies, they pay as little as they can so that their staff can just about do the bare minimum. They can't afford to do anything else, really, as they must try to survive on very thin margins."
"Like everything in life, its all fine until something goes wrong. This is the same with Fly365.I booked BNE-GRU return. I am currently in GRU (so only have my return sector to fly in 4 weeks), and when I queried about a possible change to my ticket Fly365 advised that my return sector had been invalidated due to a ""no show"". Apparently, the airline (LATAM) doesn't know when a passenger is on their plane or not ;(Anyways, I tried multiple times to explain to Fly365 that the ""no show"" was made (by the airline) in error, that I had made all my flights, and that I was currently in Brazil, and the return sector should be revalidated.Man oh man... what a mess... firstly, Fly365 don't answer their phones, and by that I mean any of their phone numbers. To try and show Fly365 that I made all my flights was another problem. They asked for boarding passes, which I couldn't find from flights 4 weeks prior.. I did have bag tags still, and an immigration arrival stamp in my passport for Brazil - but clearly Fly365 still thought I was a ""no show"".I began to get a sneaky feeling that they are one of these ""fly by night"" agents that take bookings/payments from people and then cancel afterwards (this has happened with agents that have cash flow problems)... So, I threatened a chargeback on my credit card if my return sector was not revalidated... In response, they called me and threatened to contact ""Border Security"" to prevent me from traveling if I did a chargeback.All in all, I wouldn't give this company another dollar of my money, ever again.So, buyer beware... I'm sure many of their flights are ok, but when something goes wrong then you see the real difference between a solid reputable operator and a shonky operator.I wouldn't recommend Fly365 to anybody. It's better to simply get a quote and take it to Flight Centre and get them to price match it.Others have questioned the actual owner/location of Fly365, and I am starting to get the impression its completely offshored to India... it *might* have an ABN and an address, but my cat can apply for an ABN, and the address could be anything, including a ""mates house"" which redirects the mail."
"Like most of the online ticket floggers (they are certainly not travel agents) Fly365 may use an answering service in India, but they are certainly an Australian operation."
"Frommy:""Ticket floggers"" are businesses, and Fly365 is an Australian registered business (with an ABN and ACN), therefore subject to Australian consumer law. In a legal sense, I am not exactly sure how pertinent being a ""travel agent"" is or not. Fly365 sold a customer (me) a ticket, and that ticket is not being honored (they, or their supplier, have invalidated the return sector because, in their suppliers mind I did a ""no show"", which by the way is totally incorrect; not only did I show up I also boarded the flight and flew to the destination)I feel pretty confident that if Fly365 do not revalidate the ticket, or provide a satisfactory remedy then I am entitled to claim a chargeback with my Australian bank. Make no mistake, I don't use chargeback unless its absolute worst case, last line of defence, no other remedy available, merchant not honoring agreement, etc."
"In a more general sense, using the term ';travel agent' tends to conjure up images of a professional business who will care about their reputation and repeat business. They will normally endeavour to provide good service, help and support.Online booking sites don't care about such things at all, because they know that there is a seemingly endless stream of customers willing to jump straight in and book with them without further thought. So they don't care a jot if they upset someone. Another punter will be along in a minute to replace them.And that's why I think it's important to describe them as ticket floggers rather than travel agents."
Thank you for expanding on the message Roj.
"During an enquiry on Skyscanner, Fly365.com.au offered a great deal on business class seats for an upcoming trip. I held the seats while I tried to get more information on the company as I hadn't previously heard of them. By all accounts, the company registrations etc all check out although I was unable to confirm their AFTA membership and they appear to be offshore. The booking number (seats held, not paid for) appeared to be legitimate and was recognised by the airline. Whilst the reviews didn't give me any level of comfort (anything positive was a one off review with no history, anything with history was negative) the alarm bells sounded when I was transferred to a third party site for payment. The site not only added a significant fee for Mastercard when Fly365.com clearly stated zero fee for Mastercard, they also have a landline phone number that is not connected and a couple of personal mobile numbers (I didn't try phoning those). Further, they also claim to be an AFTA member however the 'learn more' link to there again only resulted in an error. All in all, whilst the Fly365.com site was fairly straight forward to use (and the pricing good) I cancelled my held seats and booked directly with the airline at a slightly higher price rather than provide credit card details. Just followed a gut feeling on this one but would be interested to hear feedback from others who have used the site."
"Did you bother to read any of the previous 157 posts on this thread, or any of the other threads about this mob here on TA?"
"Yes of course I did Frommy, hence my reference to the only positive comments being from new users contributing only one post. Whilst many of the negative comments related to people having problems trying to change bookings a lot were opinions from others who had not used the Fly365.com site and were directed at the individuals writing the review. My post was simply my experience particularly with regard to the seemingly dodgy third party Fly 365.com use for collecting payments which had not previously been mentioned."
"In reply to SBSJ are you sure you attempted to book with fly365.com, or fly365.com.au? The latter is an offshoot of Aziz travel, a Melbourne company which shirttails on to other websites.  I have booked twice with fly365.com, both times straight forward return flights and around 9% cheaper than the airline. Each time immediately received PNR and etickets. They do have a physical office in Brisbane and offer visits by appointment."
"My daughter booked 2 flights for her and her boyfriend to go to her best friends wedding. Unfortunately the wedding was called off. My daughter did not want a refund just to re book another flight for Christmas and was prepared to pay the extra cost. Fly365.com wanted to charge $800 per ticket to cancel plus $325 per ticket to rebook plus $135 as a processing fee per ticket and of course the extra cost for a more expensive Christmas ticket. Nice little earner - they’re having a laugh, clearly. Don’t trust these people."
Adding a third party into the mix can only invariably mean that there will be additional fees to be paid for any changes required. These things can easily be found out before making a booking through a third party.
yeah and look what happened to Bets jet Golddigger
"If I could give 0 star I would. They care about you only untill you buy tickets then no-one is interested. I had to change my original tickets to a new departure date and was told that the fare difference would be $286aud which I happily paid in addition to their and the airline rebooking fee. Then, later in, I found out that the difference in fare was $186 AUD only. Contacted 365 and they made multiple excuses basically telling me they can't do anything and are not interested in refunding me the difference. I have lodged a complaint with NSW Fair Trading. Waiting for an outcome"
Did they charge their fee separately?...airline change fee + fare difference + fly365 feeTheir fee appears to be $100 or $120 depending on the route...it is covered in the t&cs under 'our change and cancellation fees'
Better to book directly from the airline company. Maybe a little bit more expensive but spears you trouble later on as if you need to change something you will have to pay double as there is fee for fly 365 and an airline company to rebook. Also got 365 gives you higher price for difference in Fair. I was fought it it and in total I paid more because I used fly 365 instead of booking directly. Much more
">>>They care about you only untill you buy tickets then no-one is interested.<<<I don't find this at all surprising, sorry. They exist to make a profit, not to care about people. On top of that, they simply can't afford to care, because they no doubt work on very thin margins and need every penny or cent that they can lay their hands on in order not to go bust.Your conclusion is spot on and I'm only sorry that you had to learn the facts about these online ticket floggers the hard way."
They're shocking and they're support is even worse if anything happens you can barely get in touch with them. I highly will not recommend fly365 .. use Wotif Instead a lot better and great support!
>>> I highly will not recommend fly365 .. use Wotif Instead a lot better and great support! <<<Haha. Or book directly with the actual airline instead and not have a completely unnecessary middle man.
"BEWARE BOOKING WITH FLY365. I rebooked my flights on credit which cost $1180. I called up customer service to rebook it but was told to put it on email with a screenshot of the preferred flight destination and price. I asked the flight to be from Melbourne to Heathrow twice with the stated date in an email and attached a screenshot of my preferred flight with airfare price. ALSO BEWARE IF YOU BOOK WITH FLY 365 ANY ADDITIONAL CHANGES WILL COST YOU NEARLY $500 IN REBOOKING COST. They charged an extra $450 dollars for rebooking my whole trip fee even tho the airfare was only $50 difference. I got sent through an email later around 1am with the flight details thinking it was the same preferred flight of my email screenshot I requested. I got told to book it within 2 hours or the air prices would increase, being in a sleepy daze I confirmed the flight only to realise a week later that the flight is going to Gatwick which is an inconvenience to myself. Asking to change the booking cause a mistake has been made, the blame was pushed on myself for not double checking the flight. I admit it was my fault for not double checking the confirmation although I put my trust with thinking I would receive what I requested for. No apology was made on their end and when I kept asking why would you send through flight details which don't match up to their customers preferences, I did not get an answer. Again if you think about booking with them beware that if any changes you'll pay an excess amount for it. A simply apology would have been the right way to go about it rather than pushing the blame on your customers."

"""Again if you think about booking with them beware that if any changes you'll pay an excess amount for it.""Cheaper tickets tend to have high change penalties or are even non-changeable.Then comes a possible charge for fare differences.And then, as you have chosen a third party, a service charge comes on top for their work.A confirmation is exactly what it says. You confirm to the changes. Airport codes are pretty clear. I agree that not everybody knows them by heart, but then there is google to check. That would take less than a minute."" the blame was pushed on myself for not double checking the flight. I admit it was my fault for not double checking the confirmation"" Agree, your mistake. Double checking would be good. But a single check would have done the job.I just have to change a ticket for a trip in August. Plans have changed and so did the dates. I have booked directly with the airline. So, me too, I will pay a change penalty and a fare change, but no service fee.The only option not to pay for changes is to buy a fully flexible ticket directly from the airline. However, these tickets are expensive. In my case the date change will cost me less than the difference for the fully flexible ticket, if I do not have to change it once again."
Yes they are fraudulent. Ripping people off.
And this is an update:Received a call from Fly365 offering me a full refund today. Straight away I thought something was fishy and of course it was. Because I bought tickets in January ( 5 months ago) the price was much cheaper than now. The refund I was offered is hardly would be enough to buy new tickets for my departure date in the beginning of June. Just checked the price for the same dates with the same airline company and its is twice as much as it was when I bought it. So my thoughts are that these dishonest people offered me a refund because they know my tickets could be resold for a double price now which will make them making even more money from me. No way. Fly 365 please stop treating people like they are idiots. Shame shame shame. I hope you will run out of customers with your dishonest practice.
Never trust this company. I learnt on my mistake
Exactly. They care only before you pay. Then no support and constant rip off
I also highly would discourage from buying tickets from fly365. Riff of
"""So my thoughts are that these dishonest people offered me a refund because they know my tickets could be resold for a double price now which will make them making even more money from me. No way. Fly 365 please stop treating people like they are idiots.""Well you are an idiot if that is what you believe."
"I'm struggling to work out why you think the tickets can be re-sold, Pavel."
"It's simple really. Imagine someone who bought tickets cancels his/her trip. This means that seats are freed and could be resold. Because I bought my ticket long time ago the price for my seat was cheaper than it would be now closer to the departure date which is in June. So for the company that sold tickets, Fly365 in this case, is beneficial offer me a refund and resell the available seat for higher price. The difference between what they refunded me and the new price they would pocket. By doing this they solve all problems. My case would be closed thus, NSW Fair Trading would be satisfied. The Fly365 itself would get more money but the only victim is still going to be me as I won't be able to by tickets for that price I paid earlier. Does it make sense?"
"No, it doesn't make sense at all.You seem to believe that Fly365 have an allocation of seats on each flight for them to sell as they wish. This just isn't so. When you request them to make a booking on your behalf, they go to the airline and try to book seats. If they succeed so much the good for you, quite often you will find that the price you have seen is no longer available. When you cancel, they contact the airline and let them know. The seat is then the airline's to do what they want with - not Fly365's.If you had bought a refundable ticket (and many/most aren't) the airline issues a full or partial refund to Fly365. Fly365 deduct their admin charge and pass on whatever (if anything) is left to you.What happens to the seat released can vary - the airline may re-sell it to someone else, they may use it to cover over-booking, occasionally they may find that it is then possible to use a smaller plane so there is no seat to be resold.How do Fly365 make any money? Mostly off admin charges. Many airlines no longer give discounts or commission to online booking agents, and those who still do have greatly reduced the percentage. If the ticket is cancelled they won't pay anything at all."
"It's still not making sense because it's not Fly465's seat or ticket to sell. It belongs to the airlines and the passsenger whose name is on the ticket, not to the booking agent.Andy has it right, and I'm afraid you have it completely wrong, Pavel."
Andy. What you are saying about booking agents making their money on admin is BS. They make money because they bulk buy tickets from airline companies and in case of cancellation it is absolutely possible for them to resell it. Get your facts right. Maybe you you are the one of those professionals rm posters who get paid for their posts by companies in order of defending and discriminating genuine complaints and posts. No wander you have more than thirty thousand posts on trip advisor. Honestly? Do you really think people are so stupid?Edited: 1 year ago 
Same to you Roj.
Same with Roj. Probably get your facts straight
"You are very wrong, Pavel. The airlines do not sell bulk tickets online ticket floggers. If they did this then Kiwi, edreams, Bravofly, Travelgenio, Expedia, and the rest would have stacks of tickets ten times over the amount in the plane. All these shoddy third party middlemen do is transfer your data and purchase a ticket from the airline with their credit card after taking your money. They run on very thin margins. All the money is made on admin fees. That’s how the business model works."
"Then please explain how on earth they sell tickets around 7-10% cheaper than the official airline companies? A good will? Ahahahaha same I was told by Fly 365 representative yesterday. Anyway, my point was about fly 365 ripping off people and I experienced it myself. I have no issues with them charging their rebooking fee but I do have issues with hidden fees and charges they impose. Read my original post if interested.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Pavel,You have NFI what you are talking about. Andy is 100% accurate in his description of what happens in reality."
Ahahaha. Then explain how come they sell tickets lower than airline companies by 7-10% please. I cannot see any reasonable explanation you are giving apart of swearing lol.
"You are just so wrong Pavel. Third parties on the whole don't buy in bulk from airlines. Where do you get the idea that they do? Why would an airline like United, for example, want to sell tickets to an agent at a lower price than they can get themselves? It defies logic.And as for being a paid poster, I don't think that Fly365 are getting their money's worth are they? Because no one here has a good word to say about them. You seem to be as confused about whether people are defending them as you are about everything else, because no one is defending them at all just because what you say is, quite rightly, being challenged."
"Pavel, you really have no idea what you are talking about. Most brick and mortar agents book seats through a GDS, where they can select the most suitable fare for their clients (cheapest, upgradable, most flexible etc.). The airlines restrict the number of seats in each fare class, and when the lowest fare sells out, the best available fare will be higher.My understanding of online 'agencies' is that they generally book through a GDS, however they will book the lowest available fare. In Australia, agencies are paid commission by the airlines which can vary from 2% to 10% of the base fare, plus they get rebates. In a retail store, this goes toward paying salaries as well as rent etc. As the online agencies have minimal staff and could be operating out of someone's spare room, they will discount the fares to the Nett, knowing they will make money by charging high admin fees.There are also ticket consolidators who I believe have access to specially negotiated fares, however I have never dealt with them. I do know Bestjet used them and they were the ones cancelling the ticketed flights for Bestjet customers."
I've have booked and flown though them and there were no issues.
I'm defending them. I found them to be more reliable that Expedia and they were easy to deal with. Other people have defended them as well
I think you've been very lucky. Your luck could run out at any time.
"they seem to have stuffed up my name, ending up with my last name entered as first name and repeated as last name. then changed near $300 to correct it."
Fly365 are the greatest RIP OFF I have ever come across in years of international travel . Total scammers . Do NOT book with them !
Total rip off !!! Do not use Fly365
"Jim L,You are spending time now finding Fly365 complaint and warning forum topics and posting vague warnings. Why couldn’t you find all the complaint and warning forum threads before you chose them and booked? You could have easily avoided them and booked directly with the airline instead.It’s too late after the event to be starting to Google and find out about their reputation."
"Jim - can you explain the ""rip off"" and ""scam""many of the complaints about third parties are down to customers not understanding what they are asking the third party to purchase for them....without any detail your complaint could be one of the many ""non-complaints""can't get refund on non-refundable ticketcosts to make changes (airline fees plus added agent service fees)no hold baggage included for basic / lite fareadvertised price didn't exist and ended up paying more etc etc"
"Warnings in general don't seem to be effective. I guess that vague warnings are even more likely to be ignored, if they are ever seen at all."
Good experience after a problemFirst I book here but thanks to kayak.com And I receibed a confirmation e mail with all details and when I looked for the confirmation on the airline it said thatcher confirmation code was invalid and the booking doesn’t exist. I called customer service of fly365 and send me the right code. It really scared me because I thought it was a fake company but at the end they are real and solved mi problem
"Don't think they are real,they deducted the booking fee for my daughter flying Malaysia to Doha Qatar ,given a reference number but when we check in no reference booking as what they give us..so we bought again. To another agent.until now they never replied back to email and the money whereabout."
I think they are definitely real. And awful.
"You've accidentally posted the same thing again, Pverb."
I booked our airfares to Fiji yesterday no email of ticket or confirmation please help
Have you tried calling Fly365?
"DO NOT USE FLY365.COMI was meant to depart Auckland and my distination was Johannesburg South Africa. I ticket included transit through Australia. They are refusing to refund my ticket after they did not inform me that I needed a visa to transit Australia.They are saying it is my responsibility to get a visa for a destination I am transiting, even if I am not entering that country.They are simply scamming people and refusing to accept responsibility. I am $1600.00 out of pocket and they don't care.Very very disappointing"
"I was curious so Googled their website and they say in their Terms and Conditions that customers are responsible for checking if visas are needed and for getting them:-https://au.fly365.com/en/support-centre/termsSo they don’t inform you, it is you who need to check what is required.Did you read their T and C pages before booking?"
"I relied on the information received in their booking confirmation. It reads:Passport / Visa Please ensure your passport is valid for six months beyond your intended return date. Some countries require you to obtain a visa prior to departure or on arrival into certain countries. Please check your visa requirements prior to travelMy distination was Johannesburg, not Australia, and I had no intention to enter Australia either. Transit time was only 1 hr 35 mins. I relied on the booking confirmation, not their website."
"There is no transit in Australia, same as the USA. You enter the country even id only for an hour. You were warned, but ignored that thinking you knew better."
"Some countries require you to obtain a transit visa, whether you enter the country or not. The US is a great example of all non-citizens (and maybe Canadians?) needing either a visa or a visa-waiver (ESTA) to transit through the country. Anytime you fly internationally and have layovers in other countries which are not your destination you obviously need to check their transit rules and Fly365 clearly states that you are responsible for obtaining all travel documents."
"It is Australian, based in Brisbane!"
"It is Australian, based in Brisbane, and I have booked with them, no problems at all"
">> They are simply scamming people and refusing to accept responsibility <<the responsibility for visas and passports is ALWAYS the passengers, You will find this whether you book direct with the airline or through a third partyyou agreed to - The passenger accepts any and all responsibility in ensuring they have understood ­and prepared for all such requirements of their travel, and accepts all consequences that may arise from failing to do so.An expensive error to make unfortunately for you."
Over an hour and a half on hold now just to verify my payment details. God I hope they didn't cancel my flight because it's all more expensive now.WORST EVER. Pay $15 more with someone else and save yourself hairloss
Pay whatever the airline is asking and have peace of mind along with better customer service.
"I booked with fly365 on 23rdJuly19 and fees been charged and received booking reference number with both fly365 reference number and airline reference number. At the time of booking the flight fee is AUD$ 848 and if I booked from airline website the fee is AUD880. I chose fly365 because of AUD32 cheaper.But on 27th July19, four days later, I received an email from fly365 telling me that my booking has been cancelled. I called airline directly, and they confirm the booking has been cancelled. And when I go to fly365 website, with my booking reference no, the booking status is still confirmed. I haven't seen any money refund to my card yet. But when I log online, searching for the same air flight, the flight has increased from AUD880 to AUD1010. I knew that fly365 didn't secure my flight on the first place and because the flight fee has increased over four days.. They choose to cancel my flight. Now I still waiting for my money to be refund and have to book the flight with AUD170 more expensive.This is very bad experience. I will never buy ticket from this website again."
"Thank you for that information Angela, I have booked and travelled several times using fly 365 for exactly the same reason you did, straightforward return flights and saving around 9% . As they are locally based and confirmed flight and price availability at time of booking I did trust them.However not any more.! I found it interesting they have not ever replied to negative comments on this forum."
"Booking flights with 3rd party providers is by no means a scam. There only ever seems to be real problems when people look at changing flights or looking for a refund. If you read the T&Cs it clearly states that in their. I’ve used Fly365 & DirectFlights for years now without a hitch. Actually, I booked flights to Vietnam from Melbourne a few days ago, and was issued my E-Ticket within 15 minutes as per usual. Use your head, if your booking flights that you may have to change, book direct and pay a higher price."
"Please read post 220 carefully, she did not try to alter her booking but simply was sold a product which was not truly available. This appears to be the method used by the known shonky operators and until now Fly365 only sold available flights with live (at the time of booking) prices.  It appears this has changed!"
Booked a Syd to Akl business class flight. Trying to check in for tomorrow morning and flight is cancelled. Fly365 have sent nothing about a cancellation or change and Emirates are saying the booking ref is invalid. Have tried to contact fly365 but only way is via email with a supposed 4 hour response time. Looks like that cheap fare was.too good to be true and gonna cause a world of pain.
"When booking flights it states that baggage is not included and this can be done directly with the airline. However after calling the airline to do this they advised this CAN NOT be done and must be done via the travel agent. Upon further research I later found a part in their website that states this excludes Air Nz flights. When contacting the travel agent they have continued to lie, and give false information and are now trying to charge $300+ fees in order to change my booking. Extremely unhelpful customer service, they continue to not answer my questions. BEWARE. There terms and conditions are inaccurate, they provide misleading information and then blame the customer."
"Have used fly365 twice, business class to europe, and they have been cheaper and more reliable than any other retail or online travel company i have used over the last 30 years of travel. Have made changes to flights, with prompt service and minimal costs compared to others."
Worst....They have an attitude.. Never get any flight tickets from them.
">> and are now trying to charge $300+ fees in order to change my booking <<the key bits you missed when you agreed to the terms and conditions""When booking with Fly365, all fares should be considered not refundable or unchangeable and incur a 100% cancellation fee. You should ask us if we can help in any particular case; as we will support appropriate cases with the Airline, but cannot guarantee any success. In the case that a change is approved the following fees will apply.Changes to Domestic/Trans-Tasman bookings will incur a fee of $100.00 per passenger per booking in addition to supplier fees.Refund Cancellations to Domestic/Trans-Tasman bookings will incur a fee of $100.00 per passenger per booking in addition to supplier fees.Changes to International bookings (excluding Trans-Tasman bookings) will incur a fee of $135.00 per passenger per booking in addition to supplier fees.""you add the Fly365 fees to the airline fare rules fees of the ticket you asked them to purchase.The cheaper the tickets, the higher the change fees generally."
"Fly365 is not reliable. I tried to buy airfares on line with them a few days ago as they listed the cheapest price, but their website did not permit a purchase. I phoned their ‘customer service’ and was given the run around. I was advised that they would recontact me within 20 minutes, but that never occurred.Very poor customer service. Steer clear of them."
>> as they listed the cheapest price <<you are their ideal customer....see a price and don't question whether it is a live price (it isn't) or do any research on whether they are a good company and give them your money!If you want to see live prices and availability with instant confirmation you should be on the airline website rather than chasing non-existent suck-in fares from shonky ticket floggers
Do you have the customer support number??
How is Fly365 still in business. I am horrified that they just cancelled my flight on Quantas without my permission 3 days before my flight and wants more money to make me fly another airline. Quantaas won't help me reinstate as they say go back to the Travel Agent...are they in cahoots? Fly365 are frauds!
Fly365 are scam artists. They rob you of money and I can't believe Quantas airline allowed them to cancel my flight without consent from me. I have asked Quantas to assist and they refuse to assist as I must go back to the fraudsters
"Qantas (note spelling) have nothing to do with this mob. You did not make a booking with them you requested Fly365 to make a booking and, as they do not have live fares, they could not do so. I would bet that no booking was ever made. When they realised the real price they asked you for more money.You cannot deal direct with the airline once you have appointed an agent to act on your behalf, because he agent owns any ticket they book, not the traveller.Fly365 are still in business because mug punters, chasing the elusive air fare fairy, just throw money at them, like you did, without doing any research."
"I don't understand how people tickets are taken back off them months after the purchase? Didn't these people check their booking with the airline? If the airline has your booking, then Fly365 cant change it later?"
"Qantas and Fly365 are not in cahoots at all. The agent has most probably messed up somewhere along the line, which wouldn't be a surprise to me as most of the ticket flogger websites like Fly365 are very poor at what they do.Frommy has explained well why they all remain in business."
>> as I must go back to the fraudsters <<you chose them to be your 'agent' rather than booking direct with the airlinedid you just pick the cheapest (non-live) price in a comparison site? did you do any research?was there ever a ticket issued or just a reservation made?>> How is Fly365 still in business <<because people like yourself choose to give them your money. no customers = no business.
Try contacting the Australian Federation of Travel Agents.https://www.atas.com.au/lodge-a-complaintIt worked for me a few years ago.Good luck.
"As far as I can see Fly365 are not members of AFTA, and they would not qualify for membership as they are just ticket floggers."
There are 2 Fly365 websites in Australia. The .com one looks to be an ATAS participant while the .com.au (Aussizz Travels) one has had it's ATAS registration cancelled.afta.com.au/atas/…cancelled-atas-participants
"I read the horrible reviews about Fly365, decided to disregard them and regretted big time. DO NOT BOOK YOUR TICKETS WITH FLY365!!!I discovered a month before our trip to Europe that one of our flights has been cancelled, but Fly 365 had not informed us. So I contacted them (via email and phone), but no reply. Discovered few days later that FLY365 had cancelled 2 out of 3 flights to Europe, providing us with no explanation, substitute flights or etc. Then we started bombarding them with emails - and 2 days!!!! before departure, they managed to get us another flights, but that meant that we had to stay 2 hours in Amsterdam. In stead of compensating for accommodation (which wouldn't have been necessary if they had reacted to our first email or actually did their job and rearranged the flights) they asked if we had any friends in Amsterdam we could stay with! So we were left with out of pocket expenses because they couldn't react on time. So when we got to the airport - they hadn't made the booking correctly and check in lady had to spend 45 minutes to get our luggage go to correct destination (we had everything on one ticket, but Fly365 had f-d up when booking new flights for us.)Will never ever book with them again, and will rather pay more to actually have a normal customer support available."
You probably won't pay more overall by booking directly with the airline directly.
"OK, so we only found these reviews after we have booked flights from Canberra to Milan next June! We saved about $250 a ticket which was appealing at the time, but now I'm a bit concerned.We didn't initially get an airline booking number, which set off alarm bells. However, we did get one when we contacted Fly365. So we now do have a booking number with Singapore Airlines and have allocated seats. So it seems that we do have a genuine booking (which some people on here obviously didn't), but I'm now worried that they might cancel our flights just before we depart. I'll make sure we have travel insurance, but not sure if that will cover the agent cancelling flights?"
"@James, I booked with Fly365 earlier in the year and flew with no issues!I was also initially very worried as I only read these reviews after booking (will not make that mistake again). I did however instantly received the airline confirmation code after booking and also called Etihad to confirm that all details were correct.There's not much that you can do other than check regularly that the booking hasn't been cancelled via the airline website, check in online as early as you can (don't wait to turn up at the airport to find your booking is cancelled) and make sure that you have a backup plan in case, but fingers crossed it's not needed. I doubt travel insurance will cover a third party cancelling the flights.Obviously (and unfortunately) there's a lot of horror stories out there regarding third party websites but Fly365 can't conceivably cancel every single booking that is placed with them, and people are far more likely to report bad experiences than good ones-there would be many, many people like me who flew with no problems."
"Making your reservation is the easy part, and if it at the price initially quoted online, all the better. The real test of Fly365 is when you need to contact them to resolve any issues such as flight cancellations or time changes etc."
"Did you fly? My friend just got a ticket from them, and now he’s not sure if the booker is confirmed or they just got his money..."
"Ananilla #246 what your friend needs to do is go the airline's website and see if they have a booking there. I just booked another fare with BA yesterday, and even though I booked directly with BA, I check the reservation in manage my booking.If the booking is there, it is wise to check with the airline on a regular basis, not just turn up at the airport on the basis of the information Fly365 have sent."
"Stumbled upon this forum when I was checking if they are reliable since I didn't get my airline reference in the booking confirmation and my first time booking through them. I booked a return ticket for my parents, flying tomorrow 23rd Oct AKL - BKI. Got it after I emailed and enquired about it, got a response pretty quick, around 2 hours. I tried managing booking on airline site to check and it works so everything checks out and is actually great so far. Will provide update after my parents fly."

Fly65 cancelled my flight 48 hours before flight day without my permission. The details were correct but they suddenly cancelled it and then told me that Quantas hadn't made the requested correction which was untrue. Several people saw it as correct. They are thieved and fraudsters. We're trying to get a refund and they just don't answer. Shocking that they are not out of business. They also seem to organise false good reports!!
Definitely not. They have been absolutely dreadful
They can't communicate properly written or in person. This is not possible
"Far more likely that they cancelled your booking request rather than an actual confirmed booking with QANTAS. Depending on when you made your request, it may just be a hold on your account. If they have actually processed the payment. stop faffing around with them and just dispute the payment with your credit card provider"
"@Joannes: Did you had actually a ticket issued? Did you check that on the Qantas website? Or was it just a booking request (request from you to them without issuing a ticket?).""Quantas hadn't made the requested correction which was untrue. Several people saw it as correct."" What changes should have been made?""We're trying to get a refund and they just don't answer."" Contact your credit card issues, check if the payment is on hold or charged. If it is the latter, dispute the charge."
Hey! I just booked a trip to Norway! Is it safe? The tickets are real right ?
"""Hey! I just booked a trip to Norway! Is it safe? The tickets are real right ?""Right question, wrong timing. You should have asked this before you book. Now is a bit late.Read for yourself. Hope that in your case all goes smooth."
"Hi I have had a very bad experience with Fly365.I had flights booked with them for January 2019 and return in march. But due to ill health of my month I had to Fly before time and return was unchanged.They cancelled my return and did not inform, And when I tried contacting them and informed about my situation and demise of my mother, they straight away denied to refund the ticket cost. Instead they offered a credit with extra booking fees and variance of new ticket, if any, which was equivalent to a complete new fare.I have had no consideration from there end. A very bad experience with FLY365."
">> I had to Fly before time and return was unchanged. <<did you change your outbound flight through them or did you purchase a new outbound flight separately?It is common that when a flight is missed/not taken all further flights on the same booking are cancelled (will be in the fare rules)>> they straight away denied to refund the ticket cost. <<it was very likely a non-refundable ticket you purchased so you would be best dealing with your travel insurance.A third party is a middleman and the airline fare rules apply. If the airline do not refund them, they have nothing to refund you. The airline will refund as per the fare rulesSorry for your loss"
"Okay, i have downloaded the thai airways app and my booking is there and it does not seem like there is any trouble. I just have not ordered tickets from this site before, was just curious. But I guess the tickets are legit since the app shows my booking :)"
Terrible experience. Poor customer service. I asked for their assistance days prior to my flight. Still nothing.
"""I asked for their assistance days prior to my flight.""Assistance like a call from the customer service, or assistance like support for mobility reduced people at the airport?"
Who can I make a complaint too regarding Fly365 can anyone help do they have a complaints department?
If they did it would be a waste of your time complaining to them.
"They aren' going to throw money into dealing with complaints. Why should they when they don' care? And they don't care because they know full well that hey can be awful and yet they will still get plenty of people using them who haven't done one second's research into how good they are, how they operate, or anything else."
Do bot book with these scammers!
"Never fear, 226. The majority of regulars here have more than two brain cells to rub together, and therefore, never would book with a third party as shonky as these guys."
The poorest customer service I ever experienced...not recommended
"do not use them, not a good after sale support. Bad customer service. only interested in selling fares and making money."
Hi i have a book ticket but there is no ticket number and before flying few hours cancel flight
"Imran, an agent can’t cancel a flight, only an airline can do that. An airline will cancel a ticket if not paid. Agent can cancel a booking request or a ticket. If you booked very close to the travel date Imran, my guess is you never had a confirmed booking but rather only had an acknowledgement of a booking request. If the agent is unable to find a ticket at their advertised (non live) price, they cancel the request or ask for more money.Did you at any point check you had an actual booking on the airline’s site?"
"Very poor after sale services,"
"Fly 365 cannot be trusted, don't use them..You will be end up your holiday in the mess"
"Fly365 is not professional, do not hold any responsibilities , screw up web- for traveller. Please avoid using them..."
"Screw up, avoid them..."
"Not reliable, shine away from using them. I having very bad experience with them, always put the blame on customers"
Four posts and no information James?
Worst service ever. Gave me an invalid itinerary and ruined my trip
"Just had the worst experience! 4 days of back and forth after booking a return flight for about 900€. Booking went fine, then they ask u some confirmation code that you have to get from your bank. You give them that, then they say there was a price surge so i should pay again 80$. Desperate to get my booking i did. Turns out my bank says the ticket has been charged twice now and they wouldnt validated my booking. Bank says it s scammyDont use them!"
"Ok so I thought i'd just advise everyone on my experience with Fly365 - I'm an avid traveller and have always booked using 3rd parties with no problems whatsoever. I just booked flights from Perth to Seattle yesterday and paid a fair bit, the status of my booking was 'reserved' and not yet ticketed. So i left it yesterday and rechecked today with the status still the same as yesterday. After seeing everyone's comments on here I went into freak out mode, I still hand't received my confirmation from Singapore airlines and after countless emails back and forth from Fly365 they still hadn't rectified the issue. Singapore airlines confirmed that Fly 365 had my money and they had just put down a hold on my flights until the 24th of December.Cue freak out.So I'm on the phone trying to get in contact with Fly365 and also my bank, hopefully being able to cancel the payment. Luckily i was able to get in contact with my bank first and lodge a dispute. I finally got through to Fly365 after being on hold for 30 minutes (i never had the chance to speak to their rep as I had just finished the conversation with my bank).Literally as soon as I finished the dispute with my bank i received my flight itinerary from singapore airlines and a reply back from Fly365.So, yep i did get my eticket, and yes i've just finished having major anxiety over this whole ordeal haha!At the end of the day if you want to go through them you can, I indeed did get my etickets. But if you want peace of mind, better to go direct with the airlines or with a reputable travel agent. Cheers"
Care to advise what the price was compared to booking with the airlines?
Do not use them . We booked tickets took our money then canceled our tickets
>> then canceled our tickets <<are you sure there were tickets issued? generally you make a booking request and they make a reservation but tickets are not issued until the real fare is paid in full (rather than the non-live advertised amount that they place a hold on)As long as no tickets were issued the hold should drop off in a few days or you can speak to your card company.
"Yes, I think it's very likely that it was the booking request you made that was cancelled, not the tickets. I'm very confident that your will get your money back."
"I just made a booking that saved me $57 USD compared to the cheapest OTA other than Fly365. I made my booking and the status was CONFIRMED on Fly365 website. Upon checking the airline's, ticket hadn't been paid for and showed RESERVATION ON HOLD. I reached out to them via chat and the agent was a bit arrogant to tell me that I had just made my reservation 15 minutes ago and that it would take time for them to pay the airline. After asking if he could go ahead and pay for it, he did and all was fine. So far my experience was Okay. But hey, I got my ticket and hopefully no need to go to them for assistance in any way."
"... like change of plans, airline change of flight times, flight cancellation by airline etc."
Correct.
"Today went to the airport to get on a Cathay pacific flight, had the previous night selected seats on the airline website and got confirmation e mail flights booked through Fly365 . Waited an hour in the queue to check in and was told that mytickets had been cancelled by Fly365. Too late to book another flight so standing in the airport trying to figure out what to do and the clown from Fly 365 phones saying I was free to book another flight as my ticket had been cancelled and that they would refund my money which had already been withdrawn within 7 days. No apology or explanation. Cheapflights should dump this lot dragging them down. Just gobsmacked !"
Can you kindly provide more information? Why did they cancel your flights?! It sounds like there's more to this story as this doesn't make sense.
It is very fraud company. please never book your flight. they are charge me around double price when i want to change my flight date.they cheat with every one who doesn't know about this booking flight.
right
yes very bad experience
"The worst experience! Do not book with FLY365. I booked multiple flights for for different dates. For one of the flights I had bad food poisoning and was unable to depart, so fly365 cancelled the remainder of my flights and I did not get a refund and they refused to re-book the same flight with no additional charges. They expected me to pay an additional $500 to rebook the flight I had already paid for which they cancelled. I tried to call them to advise I was sick, however was on hold for over an hour and due to being ill I could not wait any longer. I will never use fly365, no matter how cheap the flight is, it’s not worth it considering the service and my experience."
"NXN223... if you miss a flight in an itinerary, the airline will cancel remaining flights in that itinerary. Are you sure it is Fly365 to blame?Edited: 1:58 pm, December 30, 2019 "
Sickness is what travel insurance is for.
"That's exactly what people need to pay attention to. Fly365 might have lots of flaws, but the issue reported is the airline's responsibility. If you miss the outbound flight, the return is CANCELLED on a RT. You can only get the tax portion back as it stands. If you have proof that you were sick and unable to travel, kindly reach out to Fly365 and the airline explaining your circumstances as exceptions can be made."
"No as simple as this i booked the night before received confirmation e mail fly365,paid,checked airline reference and successfully selected seats on manage my booking. Woke up early 4.30 am for 8.30 am flight checked airline reference couldn't check in online(not unusual) so I sent fly365 urgent e mail asking them to confirm my booking and went to airport, waited an hour in the check in queue and was told the booking had been cancelled. Left airport unable to book alternative flights and about 10.30 am received a phone call from fly 365 saying my booking had been cancelled and I was free to book another flight. Money was still taken out of my account they gave me the lame excuse they were required to check with the credit card company who I have spoken to and they said they had not received any query from fly365. This makes sense as the funds went out of my account which was a debit card so funds were available. Not only incompetent but lie when caught out. I booked same flights next day same airline gotogate not one issue.Regards Oatmeal"
"""I booked same flights next day same airline gotogate not one issue.""Bye bye frying pan, hello fire."
"Buyer Beware Be Very Aware.I am presently having problems with this company which has been dragging on for weeks, I will post full details when resolved but for now you really should check out these reviews on Trust Pilot before booking.https://au.trustpilot.com/review/fly365.com…"
"Byron,But that’s the problem, nobody looks for the reviews before they choose to book with them. This forum topic has 31 pages of warnings and complaints on the company, and there are other topics also.If people don’t check before booking they never see them. But everybody seems to easily find these topics afterwards, when it’s too late."
"Booked a pair of Business Class tickets in mid-November 2019 and received supposedly my Tax Invoice & Booking Confirmation from Fly365.com. I even went to the airline's website to verify the booking and found the booking there, and proceeded to select my seats, thinking that all is good. Not really - one crucial thing I forgot about, and had trusted Fly365.com on, was that I never did receive my Electronic Tickets!Imagine my absolute shock when, 3 days before my flight, I realized that my selected seats have disappeared from the airline's website, and on calling the airline, was informed that no Electronic Tickets have been issued yet for my booking! Yes, I most definitely thought then that I have been scammed by Fly365.com and that I was in deep trouble having booked all my accommodation, rental car, etc and not being able to fly in the midst of the peak year-end travel period. Called the Fly365.com Contact Centre and spoke to Dominic, who promised to take responsibility to ensure that my Electronic Tickets are issued by their ticketing team within the hour and to call me back - sadly, this did not happen. I did not receive a call back, nor did Fly365.com email me my Electronic Tickets. I only managed to find out that my Electronic Tickets have been issued by checking the airline's website - but the return sectors were wrong and was for a day earlier than what I had booked and paid for. Tried to contact Fly365.com again, but their Contact Centre has supposedly closed and all I managed to get was their office closure message. All this occurred on a Friday, and I was supposed to depart the following Monday, with the Fly365.com Contact Centre supposedly operating only Mondays to Fridays. It took quite some effort and a lot of patience and stress, but I did finally managed to get in touch with Nermeen (whom I gathered is based in Cairo, Egypt) via the Online Chat function who referred my case to her supervisor Veneet (whom I gathered was based in Dubai). Veneet finally called me. I will not go into details here but I was given a bunch of explanations (or excuses) which I still do not totally buy, but at the very least, Veneet did apologize to me and acknowledged that it was the Fly365.com team who had made a mistake. Given that the flights that I had booked and paid for were by them full and there was simply no way to get us on, I relented to accepting my fate but asked for Fly365.com to compensate me for the losses for having paid for accommodation and transfers that I now no longer am able to use and have to pay more to make alternative arrangements. Veneet did agree to this, and as of now, the compensation did come back to my credit card. Travel is by now completed, so Fly365.com did honor their end of the deal and I had air tickets which I paid for to travel - therefore I cannot call Fly365.com a fraud. It was definitely not a good experience, and will make me think many times before I use Fly365.com again (if ever), but in terms of customer service, I need to commend Nermeen and Veneet who literally saved the day and the reputation of Fly365.com, failing which I will now be calling the police, ACCC and my lawyers on them. Just sharing my experience here. For anyone wanting to use, or using Fly365.com, suggest you monitor your booking very closely, call or check with the airline if your booking is well in place, and make sure you receive your Electronic Tickets to ensure that your booking is indeed real and valid. One more thing to note is that Fly365.com does not appear to be ATAS accredited in contrary to what they claim on their website - checked this (too late) when the incident occurred and could not find them listed on ATAS, much less having won awards in the past few years, so do be wary using this Online Ticketing Agent."
I booked for my family to iraq before the political situation detoriated because of the strike of USA on iranian general I tried to change my flight they charge more than half of the ticket price I tried to change destination not acceptable even though I change to neighboring country like kuwait not even bothering to change for me they just want to charge more than the original ticket so please I have advise to you the difference is not much from the original airline's website do not book with them they so bad awful you will be robbed off if anything happen outside your control you gone better to find a new booking with another travel agency so you will be out of pocket by a lot.always get flexible tickets.
"You would have experienced exactly the same with the airline when you purchase a cheap non-cancelable, non-refundable, non-changeable fare."
"What Frommy says is absolutely true. I'll just add that while the US-Iran situation is not of your making, neither is it down to the agent or the airline."
Doesn't look like that are ATAS Members any longer.
"I booked multi-stop tickets to Vietnam in July 2019 through Fly365 as it was the cheapest deal available. Then I researched this company and my heart sank as I read all the bad reviews, and realized there was only email communication and a false New Zealand address and phone number. However, my tickets with Air NZ/Cathay Pacific came through fine (after an upbeat reminder email from me and a few days of stress-filled waiting), and all went smoothly, and we had a fantastic trip in October 2019. I was very relieved! But in the future I think I will book directly with airlines. Less worry, and better communication channels!Edited: 3:33 am, January 17, 2020 "

"OK, so others should just to leave replies to only other 1 (or 2) post wonders."
"Wow, Paul, you seem a bit upset for a new member. Have you posted before, perhaps under another screen name?"
Just booked some tickets and they were pretty quick in issuing the tickets. They are legitimate company as far as my booking is concerned.
Get back to us after your travel is completed for more valuable info
"An amateur travel agentMy booking with FLY365 was a bad experience.Payment problem: As soon as the booking was complete my payment card was charged, but the booking was not confirmed. On contact I was asked by FLY365 to submit a payment certificate from the bank. It took 3 days for FLY365 to confirm my payment. Tickets problem: Even after receiving the full payment, tickets were not released by FLY365. When contacted FLY365 referred to a link for the e-tickets. But that link was missing in their e-mail. As an online customer with 10 hrs time difference, that was a very frustrating situation for me. After repeated contact, FLY365 finally released the tickets after 9 days.Misleading information: At the time of booking it was mentioned that bags are with standard weight. But on the tickets there was no bags included.Bad communication: My contact with FLY365 was only by e-mail, and all the time responses from FLY365 were quick, informative and polite. But I felt that they were not listening to my problem and the responses from FLY365 were repeatedly the same. Lack of understanding customers problem."
I don't think anyone here will dispute that Fly365 is legitimate. The question is are they any good and how much risk does a traveller want to take of having problems somewhere along the way?
"oooo, we are in an incredibly big mess and loss of money. PLEASE DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM!!!!"
"Specific info will help folks more than just squealing, kiwis.Tell us what went wrong so folks know how and why to avoid."
"Horrifying experienceHorrifying experience, we bought the tickects, verified the transactions in the midnight and only to found out the name of my daughter is missing in the system at the airport upon check in!! And She is 2 years old. We could not re-purchase a new tickect as the airline was full. And we were not able to contact fly365 until days later. Their customer service line took us fifty minutes to talk to a real person after 15 calls. You would probably image their customer service would be empathizing the situation after causing their customer helpless at the airport and had to watch the check in time pass, right?NO!!! THEY DONT SEEM TO CARE ABOUT THE DISASTER THEY HAVE CREATED AT ALL!!!!!!! And we were not the only one booked from fly365 on that particular flight had the similar issue according to the airport service desk.So,Seriously please avoid this company! If you want to book with them, forget it, if you have decided to, dont do it, and if you have booked, cancel it, report your card lost. By any meanings, DO NOT purchase from them, 90% chance it will be scam!!!They dont need respect, THEY NEED TO BE SUED!!!!!"
"@ 310.20 January 2020 by RojBlake Yeah, I did post under another screen name, long forgotten.

"DO NOT BOOK with Fly365.I've had SO much issue with them in my recent bookingNot only would they not honour a waived fee due to a death in our family, but it took me nearly 3 days and 20 emails to have them book me alternative flights.. WITH extra charges included! There is a word for this -- and it is EXTORTION."
"My suggestion is to not change anything on your booking - even if you have to for circumstances.You'll gain a head of grey hair and. I'm an even-tempered person and they have extorted several hundred dollars from me in 'fees' for having to change a ticket (bereavement) no compassion, no understanding, no help, in fact they've made it incredibly difficult for me."
There are actually two words for your position - travel insurance.
"Sorry this happened to you, but you give away all kinds of flexibility when you book with a third party seller.This is how they make their money, not on the tickets, but on the extra fees and additional charges that occur any time any kind of change is needed"
"I don't expect compassion or understanding from any organisation. I do expect a professional and polite attitude and I also expect them to stick by the terms of the contract that I agreed to.I always have travel insurance, which helps."
When I went to select seats on my Perth to Paris flight I found that ifly365 had cancelled my flight 2 days after booking it. After a day of anxiety and a 3 hour on hold no answer they gave me a new booking number. Never again and to cap it all I would have paid same price through the airline present day rates. Not worth the pain.
"“ I would have paid same price through the airline present day rates”—-If the prices were the same, what swayed you to use a third party? Had you used them previously, or done any research?"
"I just booked it almost a year ahead and At the time there was a price difference. Not now. That's why I said present day rates.Edited: 1:02 am, February 09, 2020 "
I think you will find that they never booked it in the first place. You made a request for them to buy a flight for you; they do not have live pricing; they went to the airline to find that they could not get tickets at the prices they had advertised; they cancelled your booking request. This is not uncommon with online ticket floggers.Airlines have the true live prices.
"Thank you I was not sure of the process, I found them through Skyscanner so just thought they were okay. I now have a new booking number and e ticket, after I contacted them by email which I thought was weird given that they did not tell me about the new booking. According to the airline the booking was cancelled two days after I paid ifly365 for it."
"Never, ever, think that appearing on a wesbite like Skyscanner (or Tripadvisor) means that a company is OK. Because it doesn't. It usually just means that money has changed hands in return for a link, an advert, or featuring in the search results."
"Just don't do it ! You are dealing with rip off merchants whose practices are tantamount to fraud, no accreditation, no etickets provided and even when a full airline refund is offered for flights canceled because of caronvirus they fob you off with absolute lies about consolidators , IATA, airline approval and deductions for their commissions, credit card fees and then say this should all happen in 8 weeks but if not email us in 3 months. The business class tickets were actually canceled by the airline for no provision on any etickets in the first place. Looks like a costly legal exercise is on it's way"
"I have been trying to get hold of a FLY365 travel rep' for the past 2 weeks, everyday waiting on the phone for more that 30min before giving up. I have been given conflicting stories about my flights and seats that cannot be confirmed by Emirates due to FLY365 not issuing the correct flight eticket. All I get from the FLY365 Customer Support is absolute nonsense emails about my flights that they have incorrect. I have advise FLY365 several times (via email) to contact Emirates Customer Services and get the flights/tickets/seating sorted but they are NOT LISTENING TO ME!!! I'm fast loosing my patience and getting very stressed with the back and forth emails with FLY365 Customer Support!!!!"
"To all unfortunate people, like me who used fly365 , try dept of fair trading. The more complaints the faster the closure of this fraudulent company. We paid for two to Tickets in good faith but no e-ticket issued never heard from them again. They must be stopped.Edited: 1:26 am, February 21, 2020 "
They have just appointed administrators.
Confirmed they have just gone into administration https:/…
"Wow. On the button with the news hot off the press. Impressive. Thanks for the news.Sorry Paul and perhaps also Tony, you might have done your dough with this mob."
I have used them as they saved me a lot of money. My e-tickets have been issued and they remain issued thus far. Best of luck if anyone has been affected by this. Call your credit card company and initiate a dispute if you don't receive what you paid for.
"Louis, keep an eye on your booking as what happened with Bestjet is that both the airlines and the consolidator they used cancelled tickets which had been issued when they realised they wouldn't be paid for them.Quite simply, these OTA's sell tickets below what they cost as they make money through rebates and change fees. This business model is not sustainable."
"I am actually a bit fearful of them cancelling my issued and fully paid for ticket without my consent. I called the airline and I was told that until my flight date, fly365 has full ownership of my ticket and can cancel it even though they are not suppose to without my consent or knowledge. I had them notate the ticket to request for this not to take place. They did, but told me no promises. Very stressful situation. Not to mention that if I need to make any changes, the airline is likely to not allow me as bankrupt fly365 still has ownership of the reservation!"
"Just to let people know, we just lost business class flights to London by booking with Fly365. It appears they went into liquidation yesterday"
"Can someone provide some insight of the ""in liquidation"" process in Australia? Can this company cancel paid for reservations without the consent of passengers in order to have liquidity and pay for debts?"
What do you mean lost biz class seats??
We have etickets so assuming airline has been paid.Just called airline and they have not received any information re Fly365 going into administration. Airline calling back to advise how to proceed now.

Louis S. That’s what we’d like to know too.Think our ticket is non-refundable but airline may offer refund due to coronavirus. I’m assuming airline has the payment as we have the etickets so hopefully if refund is offered it will come direct from airline as Fly365 we’re going to deduct $300 !! Administrators might still do that.
"If the airline refunds your ticket, you need to coordinate this better with them as it is likely to go back to the method of payment, which is from Fly365. You will likely end up disputing the ticket cost with your CC company for a refund."
Keith EHave you paid ? Who cancelled your tickets?
Louis SThank you. I will definitely stay active on this but not sure how the credit card can help. Is it deemed as unauthorised/fraudulent use of my card if we don’t get what we paid for ?Sorry to bombard you with questions.
No. This would be services not provided/merchant cancelled the service you were expected to receive on xyz date. Check with your bank about this. What I do not know is whether or not a dispute can take place if fly365's bank account is at zero.
"Apparently, in case of doubt, the merchant’s bank will be liable for unjustified payments for a service you have not received. I am just worried about having to make another reservation at 4x the price previously paid!"
"Hi, we paid in full for our tickets and only yesterday realised that they had been removed from our Qantas upcoming flight list. When we spoke with the airlines they stated that the agent had cancelled and that we would need to contact them for information. We tried but the phone went through to a recorded message only - on hold for 2 hours! No response from email either."
Lesley E - when exactly did you pay for your tickets?
"Thank you Louis SOur tickets are non-refundable so if offered refund, rebook or rerouting due to virus then we may take the rerouting option. If Fly365 aren’t in business then they can’t charge a rebooking fee. Refund option will probably send the money back to Fly 365 Then it’s anyone’s guess as to what we’d get back."
"The way it works is that the flights are ticketed, THEN the airline is paid. Payments all go through IATA and are made once a week through BSP. The Travel Agency will either pay on account (if they are a large agency) or by credit card. So even though you have an E-ticket, if the airline hasn't been paid, your ticket can be cancelled. Or they may have booked the flights through a Consolidator, and this is how many of Bestjet's flights were cancelled. You might have paid Fly365, but they may not have paid the airline or consolidator.As far as refunds with Coronavirus, it is really only flights to China where they are waiving the cancellation fees. I would expect the refund would have to go through the same process as the airline was paid (to Fly365), so you would need to speak to the airline about this."
"From Travel Daily last night:Online travel agent Fly365.com initiates Creditors Voluntary Liquidation. Gold Coast-based online travel agency Fly365.com has today appointed external administrators, with Australian Securities and Investment Commission records indicating the company is now under the control of liquidator Nicarson Natkunarajah from boutique insolvency firm Roger & Carson.The Fly365.com website describes the operation as ""an Australian owned business with multiple offices overseas"".The OTA also highlights its membership of AFTA, while the ATAS website continues to indicate that Fly365.com is part of the AFTA Travel Accreditation Scheme.Directors of the company include Dubai-based Mustafa Filizkok and Scott Mayne from Queensland.At this stage the company's website appears to still be fully operational and accepting bookings, and it continues to be listed as an OTA partner of Skyscanner."
ellenwillow - the airline has confirmed payment and ticket issuance. I have asked them to take full ownership of the booking as nothing good can come out of fly365 at this time. A supervisor is suppose to get in touch with me. Is this something they can entertain without going against their policies and agreements with Fly365?
"Hi Keith. We are the same. We booked last Friday, they took the money on Wednesday and went into Liquidation yesterday. $11500 gone."
"Called Cathay Pacific. They confirmed that Fly365 have ownership of our ticket and they can cancel it even though it is a non-refundable ticket !! We were hoping to be offered a refund or reroute due to coronavirus closer to departure to China. They have not been informed about the closure of Fly365 so waiting on them to check and get back to me re what happens now. We are hoping they’ll let us re-route, as long as Fly365 doesn’t cancel it first."
"Cam, where are you flying to? If it's not into China, then it's unlikely they will allow you to reroute as Cathay flights have to go via Hong Kong. Waivers are only in place for cancellation or date changes for travel into China up to a certain date."
"Our booking is for China but departure not until end May, so it’s wait and see. They need to make a call on future dates soon to allow for visa etc which apparently they advise getting 6 weeks before arrival."
"We booked flights from Bne to Ams on 31 Dec with Fly365 and fortunately paid via credit card. I received an email with an airline confirmation number but discovered that this doesn’t work on the airline website. Lucky I discovered when I emailed that the company is no longer trading! I have contacted the airline to confirm my booking doesn’t exist with them. Does anyone know how we can get a refund other than through our credit card company? Since Fly365 were registered with AFTA, does that give us any booking guarantees? It’s a bit unfair that they can abscond with our money after this long but lucky I didn’t discover nearer the time of flying!"
How long ago did you book your BNE-AMS flight?
"Michyv, ATAS doesn't guarantee your booking, you won't get money back through this. However, they have very strict guidelines around the financial stability of companies, and have removed several companies who don't reach the criteria. There have been several wholesalers go under this year who had lost their ATAS accreditation, so Fly365 is a suprise. There are usually industry rumours, as in the case of Bestjet, so I haven't heard anything about Fly365. I suspect the Coronoavirus situation might have contributed as they have no margin on their tickets as they are selling below cost."
31 December last year.
Thanks for the explanation. I agree about the Coronavirus being the reason. At least now I can book without going through Korea. I booked prior to this escalation of Coronavirus so was a bit concerned about the impact it might have on us.
"Question ...... if they’ve already gone into liquidation but haven’t cancelled our flight can they still cancel it?They own the ticket but how could they exercise a cancelation if they’re no longer trading, I’d hope they can’t exercise any procedures if they’re not actually in business."
"I previously had tickets purchased with another travel company who went into liquidation before our flight. I contacted the airline who advised that once it had been ticketed, it was basically confirmed and they were right, I still got to take those flights so if yours have been ticketed they should still be available but maybe check with the airline"
Tickets are for China in May but if airline extends offer of refund etc I need then to liaise with me and not the liquidators.They are going to get back to me next week.
Does anyone have a number for Fly365 in Australia please need to get in touch ASAP
"Jayne H, suggest you read some of the posts before you. They have gone into voluntary liquidation."
"There is a number a Brisbane office but doubt anyone will be there since they are in liquidation. The number and is: Plumridge House Suite 16 / 36 Agnes S Fortitude Valley, QLD 4006 AustraliaPhone 1300 777 365 I would suggest getting in touch with airline if you have concerns about airline tickets. My airline tickets I purchased in December however don’t exist. If you google you can also find details of the liquidations company but thi k we have all been left high and dry unfortunately."
You purchased tickets on December and they were never issued?! Did you ever contact Fly365?
"Yes I did & I was given an airline confirmation code that worked at that time and also received two emails making it look like my flights were confirmed. Since I wasn’t flying until October,I had no reason to do much else at this time. Everything seemed legit."
"I'm so sorry to hear about this. I just received an email from my airline to invite me to bid for an upgrade. Thus far, all is confirmed. What a situation. I am asking the airline to take full ownership of my reservation as there is no other reason why Fly365 should be able to cancel it without my consent. I am now waiting for a supervisor to call me back."
Fly365 in receivership and has been assigned a liquidator.Search Fly364 liquidator on insolvency notices.Singapore Airlines has already been notified and are investigating.

"My partner and I booked April flights from Australia to the UK on 9th February. Fly365 took our money and sent us a booking confirmation.We sat down this morning to look at car hire options, and I tried to access our booking on Qatar Airways website. The booking reference didn't work, so I called the airline, and they said that there HAD been a booking, but the booking was cancelled due to non-payment.No correspondence from Fly365 and no way of contacting them now.We called the administrator directly and he suggested we contact the bank for a refund, which we have now done and there is a dispute case ongoing as of an hour ago.I knew nothing about the liquidation AT ALL until we tried to access the booking directly from the airline. I fear we may have lost our money completely but we just have to wait and see.Good luck to everyone in the same situation... we've never had it before and we are just stunned."
"How can they make a booking, send the passenger confirmation of it, but not pay for it?"
Because they could probably reserve to ticket with the airline but pay later through the IATA (?) system. If no money gets passed on from IATA to the airline ticket gets cancelled by the airline. It could also be that they might have been using a consolidator to book.
Louis S #378... I suspect they could get you a valid airline reservation code in a similar way you can reserving a flight for 24 hours for free on AA or paying a small deposit on BA holiday bookings. I assume OTAs have some sort of arrangement to get reservations but they will drop with non-payment or cancellation.This terrible situation serves to highlight one of the pitfalls of using a middleman.
"Fly365 is in liquidation. As of 21.2.20 a liquidator has been appointed and the company is been dissolved.A credit card dispute only works, as long as the credit card company can charge back a charge to a client.As soon as the company is in liquidation, there is no more account to be charged. ""I fear we may have lost our money completely but we just have to wait and see."" I am afraid you are right."
Louis SWhich airline ?As at yesterday Cathay Pacific hadn’t been advised.
"Travel agents can make a booking through their GDS which has an airline reloc number and which can be viewed through the airline website. The booking will have a Ticketing Time Limit, set by the airline, who will cancel the booking if it hasn't been ticketed by that date. The airline is then paid via IATA's billing process. So your flight may be ticketed, but the airline hasn't been paid yet they may cancel the ticket for non payment. Remember that the agency owns the ticket, not you."
"""So your flight may be ticketed, but the airline hasn't been paid yet they may cancel the ticket for non payment.""Fly365 is out of business. That is the reason they have not paid. And give above, they will never ever pay anymore."
"Fly365 is no longer in business. Wanted to check my flight which goes in 2 days and website out or order. Emails fly365 customers support and got this automated reply:Please be advised that Fly365 Pty Ltd is no longer trading. Please contact your airline directly regarding bookings you have made.Called the airline (Singapore airlines) and they instantly said 'oh, we had some people like that calling and they were not booked on the flight."" They looked up my last name for the flight, lucky I was indeed booked. But be aware and call the airline directly if you made a booking via fly365."
"I have started a Fly365 Liquidation Support Group on Facebook and have spoken to the media about this. We need to find out how many people are involved in this as I think it’s far more than we think. Skyscanner are also complicit in this, and it needs to stop. You will find the group on Facebook under the name Fly365 Liquidation Support Group.Edited: 2:18 am, February 23, 2020 "
I think it would be more efficient to contact the liquidator directly:https:/…e98214c6-4fca-4e81-a2b4-08762bc9fb17
"Fly365 have already closed their doors. Their normal website is not responding. But their mobile website is still running. Beware.Singapore Airlines told me it was rare for this to happen. SA confirmed they have already sent a message to the consolidator but have NOT received a reply about what to do as yet. SA told me they have to wait 3 days before deciding what to do themselves. I told them their accounts department should hold all refund requests from fly365 until the issues have been resolved. I've asked them to take over the authority for my reservations and to block fly365 from making any changes at all. SA assured me they would change their response to passengers calling them about this being rare to ""SA are investigating"". I'm not happy about SA slow witted and vague response and NOT happy that they have known for 3 days and have NOT already put a hold on Fly365 business activities and were not already in the position to reassure me that all was well. SA did confirm multiple times that my eTickets have already been paid for and are currently ""still good""."
"""Skyscanner are also complicit in this, and it needs to stop""Gees, come on. Skyscanner accept payments from third parties to allow them to advertise on the Skyscanner website. How does that make them complicit?(Shakes head vigorously)Edited: 2:56 am, February 23, 2020 "
"'Skyscanner are also complicit in this, and it needs to stop.' How are Skyscanner complicit? The site is a search engine, and Fly 365 and other operators pay Skyscanner a lot of money to be linked at the site. Skyscanner don't vet their advertisers any more than a newspaper vets the companies which place ads.When Tripsta went bust a couple of years ago it did so owing millions, likely having used funds from account A to pay account B, then borrowing from B to repay A. Once that was no longer viable, they ceased trading. Fly365 may have had the same razor thin margins and as such made booking requests that were never paid. If that was the case then the carriers will cancel the bookings as no payment will be forthcoming from Fly365.It's a rotten thing to have happened to the pax and those who worked for the company."
"I understand people being upset & angry and looking for persons to blame, but sadly companies (airlines and ticket floggers) sometimes go out of business. Whenever a third party is used to purchase airline tickets the customer has to trust the third party with their money and hope the company will be solvent enough to continue trading."
"I for one will never use a site like sky scanner again. This was only the second time, all other flights were booked directly with the airline or Flight Center etc. and that’s what I will be doing next time. Our flight was to China which left us with a lot of uncertainty. We’ll see if the refund offer extends to May flights.in the meantime we’ve decided to just put it behind us. Luckily our loss is not as great as others."
Stevie SIt’s great that you’re being very proactive. I’ll check out the fb page. Good luck with everything.
"If you paid with a credit card, no one has lost their money. Even if under liquidation, the merchant’s bank will be liable for unjustified payments for a service you have not received. I am just worried about having to make another reservation at 4x the price previously paid!"
"Not so sure if one would get the money back.https:/…Guess it depends a lot of the country, credit card and relevant T&C's.Plus this is not airline but an OTP.Edited: 7:47 am, February 23, 2020 "
"In case of doubt, the merchant’s bank will be liable for unjustified payments. Therefore, the bank is naturally anxious to work only with reputable traders. The merchant’s bank always holds back parts (often 5-15%) of the payments, the so-called rolling reserve. This is done to settle possible chargeback claims.Bottom line is that if you paid for a service you have not received, you have every right to get your money back. These are international standards for major card issuers such as Visa and MasterCard."
"Still waiting for the airline response to my request of having them take control of the booking. I asked them how my reservation got paid for and they told me it got paid via invoice. I asked them if that means they have the money and they do not know. I found it strange that they do not know. I inquired if the OTA can still cancel the reservation, they said yes, but they would only get the tax portion back. I assume the airline has the money then. Now trying to have the airline block Fly365 from touching the booking... Shouldn't this come from the airline once they are made aware of the situation??? It just seems like it's common sense at this point."

"I have contacted the liquidator this is their reply "" Please liaise directly with the airline in order to receive your tickets and booking confirmation, I want to ensure that you get your tickets so I have no issuewith you dealing with the airline directly in order to do so.""However I have asked them to confirm that they will not cancel my booking to get a refund to pay any outstanding creditors of Fly365. They haven't really given me control of my ticket."
Just spoke to liquidators who assured me they won't cancel bookings to recoup funds. If the airline contacts them he will ask them to contact me directly.
That's good to know I suppose. I hope they sort out all the temporary bookings that expired in the meantime due to lack of payment!
who cancelled your booking ??
Details?
TRavel agent fly365
Fly365 ceased on Friday so they must have cancelled it before then. Liquidators assured me they wouldn't be cancelling bookings
I rang Emirates on Friday to check flights . They told me they have canceled my flight . How did you pay for your flight ? . Maybe ring the people who ever your flying with to see if it still ok . Have you got a number you rang to find out they have ceased ?
How did. Fined out they ceased ?
I wrote a review about their poor service and I got an email alert. See previous posts here.A FB site has been set up Fly365 Liquidation - Support Group
Worst experience with them. They booked my flight and then keep changing booking which make it difficult to retain my seat. When I contacted they said we are no longer in trading
Gone into liquidation
Read earlier posts for contact details
"Perhaps now they have gone bust, leaving clients $000s out of pocket, people will think twice before booking ""cheap"" fares with on-line web sites."
"I'll still book with Expedia, travelgenio or fly2be. I will not use new ones though. I had never heard about Fly365, but they saved me a considerable amount of money. They seemed quite popular in the Asia Pacific region though."
"So with the collapse of Fly365, a general question about such 3rd party booking sites.. (and pls restrict responses to this question, nor moralising about trying to save money).. If one has the direct airline confirmation codes from a 3rd party booking (some months ago) , are you still at risk if the 3rd party collapses ? Is your return leg at risk even after you've flown the 1st leg ?"
"""If one has the direct airline confirmation codes"" AND they have paid for the ticket, then you should be fine.""Is your return leg at risk even after you've flown the 1st leg ?"" I would not think so.Edited: 7:08 am, February 24, 2020 "
"The airline takes full control of your booking once you fly the first leg of your flight. The second leg only gets cancelled if you don't fly the first leg or for airline operational constraints. Depending on how the travel agency made your booking, they can cancel it with the airline even after months. My understanding is that they are subjected to the terms and conditions of the fare and will likely only be able to get the tax portion back. Unless they can get the airline to issue a waiver for a full refund."
"""they can cancel it with the airline even after months""Yes, they can. But this OTA went against the wall. So there is no more nobody to do cancel anything."
"""I'll still book with Expedia, travelgenio or fly2be.""OMG. Playing Russian roulette with two of those who I would rate lower than Fly365 were IMO."
"I would say most of my flights are non-refundable or you would pay 3x the price of them to make any voluntary changes anyways. This is even if I was to book directly with the airline. The only issue I had was when an airline cancelled my flights and it took weeks to coordinate a refund with the OTA. On a recent booking, the price difference was only $20 to book with an OTA vs. Airline and it was a complex route, so I opted to book with the airline. Weeks later, flights suffered a drastic schedule change and it paid off. In regards to Fly365, I saved $80 with my booking and I do think it was worth it. A bankruptcy is an exceptional circumstance that no one involved wants. I need to add that my travel insurance protects me against this and that I believe that airlines would step up in the worst case scenario, if not for PR purposes. If everything fails, credit card dispute would have me covered."
"""they can cancel it with the airline even after months""""Yes, they can. But this OTA went against the wall. So there is no more nobody to do cancel anything.""One would think so. Still, where is the money of the people that reported booking cancellations? Previous reports lead me to believe that bankrupted Fly365 is in good faith and not going after confirmed reservations for cash. But who can actually guarantee this?"
"Fly365 was ATAS accredited so this article is interesting. https:/…I don't believe they are as dodgy as Bestjet were, but according to another article, they also used several consolidators. Uf you have made a booking with them, you do need to check that you have a Ticket number and hope that the airline has been paid for that ticket. An airline booking reference number isn't enough as Travel Agents can hold a booking for a few days or weeks before paying the airline. I now wonder if these OTA's only ticket the flight when they are dues to cancel rather than when they are paid to help cash flow.And just a heads up re these OTA'S as they are discounting the fares so much you are paying them less than what they have to pay the Airline just to get the bookings. When I had to price match Fly365 I would end up in a negative. This business model is not sustainable, as shown by the collapse of several OTA's over the last few years."
It’s more likely that agents never got around to paying the airline due to cash flow problems so the tickets were cancelled.
Where is the money then?
"In their bank account, swallowed up my overdrafts or spent on something else."
No. Collapsed.
Any advice for whoever needs help getting their money back?
Phone your bank . Tell them of your situation they will help you . They helped me . Good Luce gays
"The only advice is that if you paid by credit card, dispute the payment. If you paid by debit card, worth speaking to,your bank but may not help.Check if your travel insurance covers insolvencymof an agent.Other than that, register as a creditor, wait months and maybe gets a few pennies in the pound."

Good luck everyone."
A Facebook page has been set up for victims of Fly365Lots of different cases and adviceFly365 Liquidation - support GroupStevie Somers has set it up. He has been interviewed by reporters
That’s nonsense Took me a number of calls and pressure but Cathay has ‘taken’ my booking and now I can control it.
If you paid Fly365 but don’t have confirmation or eticket call your bank and request a ‘chargeback’ Use that word.
If it’s confirmed then request eticket. I’m not an expert but you need to at least ask the question of the airline .
'If you paid Fly365 but don’t have confirmation or eticket call your bank and request a ‘chargeback’' What to do if Fly365 never paid the carrier? If the booking was requested but not paid there won't be a refund as Fly365 no longer exists.'If it’s confirmed then request eticket.' E-tickets are just data in an airline's booking system. If there are paid-for bookings then the carrier should be able to confirm this and give the PNR with which pax can check the status of the booking at the carrier's website.
Ist pointVictims are getting chargebacks successfully From their banks. Credit card company charges back from Fly365 bankAn eticket has always got me on a plane but then I log on manage my account every week to check for changes or anything suspicious
i just want to share my casei booked my ticket via fly365 and later i check with official airlines seem ticket valid but pending on payment.after fly365 gone my booking in manage booking gone..i contact airlines their say my booking can't found.lucky ticket just around 15USD. but its still money.
"Louis posted at #337 ""My e-tickets have been issued and they remain issued thus far.""Louis posted at #339 ""I am actually a bit fearful of them cancelling my issued and fully paid for ticket without my consent. I called the airline and I was told that until my flight date, fly365 has full ownership of my ticket and can cancel it even though they are not suppose to without my consent or knowledge.""Louis posted at #356 ""the airline has confirmed payment and ticket issuance. I have asked them to take full ownership of the booking as nothing good can come out of fly365 at this time.""Louise cannot seem to accept that Fly365 only now exists as a file on the liquidators desk and there is no-one working for Fly365 who could cancel the flights he has confirmed as ticked. It would be absolutely unheard of for a liquidator to try to cancel such a flight which was booked through the normal process for dealing with such ticket floggers.I would also like to remind Louis of his post at #285 at Christmas time:""I just made a booking that saved me $57 USD compared to the cheapest OTA other than Fly365.I made my booking and the status was CONFIRMED on Fly365 website. Upon checking the airline's, ticket hadn't been paid for and showed RESERVATION ON HOLD. I reached out to them via chat and the agent was a bit arrogant to tell me that I had just made my reservation 15 minutes ago and that it would take time for them to pay the airline. After asking if he could go ahead and pay for it, he did and all was fine. So far my experience was Okay. But hey, I got my ticket and hopefully no need to go to them for assistance in any way.""Is US$57 worth all this stress?Edited: 4:33 am, February 27, 2020 "
"Wow I've got a fan. Thanks Frommie.I'll use my crystal ball next time; there is no reason why the airline would let a bankrupted company managing my reservation. This denies me service of any kind including date changes. If they are just a file, what's the big deal about removing them?"
"Service? You are joking. Third party ticket floggers like this don't provide service, even before going belly-up. If you wanted service you should have booked with the airline.Edited: 8:04 am, February 27, 2020 "
"Airline added this ""for any refund purpose you will still have to liaise with your travel agent as they are the ones you have paid to purchase the ticket initially""."
But is your flight been paid for ? Ring the people you are flying with to find out if it is still valid.
"OK, so flights are usually booked through the GDS the travel agent uses and that is where your booking 'lives'. Yes the airline can access your booking, but it remains in the GDS where it was booked. You can also access it through 'manage my booking' on the airline website, but depending on the airline, you might be limited with what you can do.Now, if the airline has been paid for your tickets, they should not be cancelled. I'm not sure what happened with Bestjet though as there were reports flights were being cancelled months afted the liquidation."
"Wow, I have just read an article in an Industry newsletter which suggests that they were holding the economy bookings in Y class as it has a much longer TTL than the sale fares, and not ticketing them until closer to travel time. If the fares had gone up, they would have been losing so much, so no wonder they collapsed. Their cash flow must have been non-existent to operate like this.So if you had an airline booking number but didn't receive an E-ticket, please check with your airline as it's likely they haven't been paid. and the booking will have cancelled.If your flights were ticketed last year, you should be OK as the airline should have been paid for the flights and the Administrator has indicated they want to protect those bookings. But please also check with your airline."
"Thanks, Ellenwillow, your feedback is very helpful."
This is what I noticed them doing with our flights. Ours were booked & paid 31 December but they never actually paid the money to the airline so no flights for us!
Mine were booked around the same time. How do you know there are no tickets?
"I don’t have an E ticket number & when I go on the airline website with the airline confirmation number, nothing comes up. I’ve tried calling the airline but they are the worst and I just cannot get through. My credit card company are trying to get me a refund."
"'I don’t have an E ticket number & when I go on the airline website with the airline confirmation number, nothing comes up.' It sounds like Fly365 had requested the booking but not paid for it.'My credit card company are trying to get me a refund.' If Fly365 had never paid the carrier then there may be little your card provider can do, as passengers are going to be low on the list of creditors."
No my credit card company can go to the merchant and request a refund as it is considered a fraudulent transaction but I also have travel insurance with my credit card company so either way I will be covered.
"TravellerPlus, can you please refrain from providing information such as ""If Fly365 had never paid the carrier then there may be little your card provider can do, as passengers are going to be low on the list of creditors""? This is false and misleading. Banks can and will assist you with a chargeback on your behalf if you do not received the service that you have purchase - ANY SERVICE. It's frustrating to see comments on this thread of people, who have not been affected by this and not only that, people that have absolutely no constructive info to provide other than fearmongering, drama and shaming others from asking questions or to have used an OTA before it went bankrupt. Enough is enough."

"Paul,Your last post was 30 January and there is no indication who you are now abusing, so I suggest that you get over it."
"Well, with the entire coronavirus situation, my flight is indeed likely to be cancelled. Airline says that they would issue a travel credit and not a refund. What a strange time in history for air travel."
Flights are officially cancelled. Does anyone have a link to passenger rights for flights leaving Australia?
https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/advice…
Did anyone manage to recover their money? Or schedule alternative travel dates with the airline directly?
Assalamualakum tuna puan saya adnan bin sahabi ingin bertanya di sini. saya punya tekit penerbangan dari kota kinabalu ke tawau di batalakn. tak boleh tukar tarikh penerbangan ke ? tak kan saya nak beli tkit balik. tolong balas emil saya atau hubungi saya di nombor 011-10365637. nama saya adnan sahabi... sekian terima kasih.
"Adnan,Fly365 no longer exists as they have gone broke.Fly365 tidak lagi wujud kerana mereka telah rosak."
"Absolute SCAM agent. I lost nearly $NZ3000 on so called return flights from Venice. No E ticket was issued and when I looked into it after Covid 19 began, FLY 365 had gone into liquidation. I will never book through Skyscanner again who issued Fly 365 as one of their booking companies available at the time I was looking.You need to be sure any on line agent is legit, something I failed to do."
"Dispute it with your bank. Don't worry, you will get your money back. Yes, they are out of business and you need to be careful with whom you book."
"You don’t necessarily get your money back when there is bankruptcy involved.Skyscanner is an advertising site. Like Google, TripAdvisor, or the classified section of your newspaper (remember those?). No advertising space vets their advertisers for financial stability or even for good customer service."
"Yes, you do your money back. I did."
"Louis, I’m glad you got your money back, however that doesn’t mean everyone will.Consumer protection varies depending on the country you live in. For example, if an airline fails, most cover you for that. Now Er Er some only do so if you bought directly from the airline Nd not a third party. Some have time limitations on when you make the claim.I agree that it is still worth lodging a claim."
"I am not sure what is so difficult to understand in this case.The liquidation admin is extremely proactive responding to people and does actively encourage customers to dispute the charge with their bank. If your card is issued by MasterCard, Visa or Amex your dispute rights are the SAME no matter where you live. If you don't receive a service that you paid for, you are entitled to a refund. Even if fly365 had $0 on their account, the merchant's bank would be liable for the disputes."
"Lodge a disputed transaction with your card provider. Explain that the flight you paid for with Fly365 was cancelled and you have not been refunded, and you want to request a chargeback because you did not receive what you paid for."
