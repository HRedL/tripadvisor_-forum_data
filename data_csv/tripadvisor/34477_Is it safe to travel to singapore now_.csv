due to the spreading of coronavirus is it safe?I have 2 kids below 4 years and considering cancelling the trip
"When are you coming? Only you can make the decision whether to travel or not, but we (family with kids) live here and have not made any changes in our routine, nor are concerned. Best advice is to practice good hygiene and wash your hands regularly.You can check the official update here:https://www.moh.gov.sg/2019-ncov-wuhan"
"You might want to check the lengthy thread already present in this forum...Personally, I would travel (but I don't have children to worry about). As above, life goes on mostly as normal around here, with perhaps some more precautions."
https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowTopic-g29…
"Dear,as in Travel agent, I had checked closely everything on the ground and it seems all okay as there are not any reports till now but if you are traveling after few days please check again on it had been affecting more and more day by day to more countries"
"If it’s a holiday and not a work requirement to come, then I may be inclined to look at alternatives. Whatever you decide monitor up to the point before you have to commit, decide accordingly. Good luck and stay safe."
"At time of writing situation in Singapore is still in control, but things could change fast in the near future. If I have two young kids like you do, I probably wouldn’t take the risk. Better be on the safe side."
It is perfectly safe.
"Unless there is a large increase of confirmed cases in the coming days - I wouldn't be too worried about travelling to Singapore. So far there is only one case where they haven't been able to trace the source but are working on it... no evidence of large community spread.Edited: 12:15 pm, February 06, 2020 "
I have someone i know there in singapore they are having troubles with the food cause groceries are mostly out of stock they got small food to take and i have a ticket to go there i have booked this ticket long ago so is it safe to go there the ticket i have is dated on april 11
"Doe, not sure where your friends live (no big supermarkets nearby?) but there are sufficient grocery supplies at the supermarkets."
Doe your friend must be exaggerating. I went to my local supermarket here last night and all the shelves were fully stocked and nothing unavailable. Certain more central Supermarkets which are easy for commuters to visit on way home from work might be worse off and have some items sold out but there is definitely no lack of supplies or food here.
"Doe, as you are not traveling until April, why not wait and see how the situation develops. The news here today stated that cases in China are likely to peak this month, which is great news. Singapore has many fewer cases and is being very diligent in addressing the situation. By April the country may well be coronavirus free."
"Confirm what Rastnim is saying. The major supermarket Fairprice in CBD has standard stock of most items. The only things i couldnt get today were masks and hand santiser. These are out everywhere. For usual shopping, fruits, veg, dairy, etc - business as usual. Don'g go by hearsay."
"Jess Amen to that. End of this. Lets get back to normal asap. Want to be carefree and less uber vigilant again!Edited: 8:52 am, February 12, 2020 "
i have plan to visit Singapore on 20th February. Is it safe in terms recent Corona virsus issue?
@Monirul S - the same query has been posted by several other members and replied on other threads. Please browse the other ongoing threads. There is no point in having so many threads on the same topic running in parallel so I suggest that we avoid further responses on this thread.

"Tomtheman, please review MRahul’s post below. Thank you"
"You need to do some research on the Internet, but make sure you use reputable sites, and only look at pages written in the last few days.Most recent threads on this forum are about the virus, so read some of them, again concentrating on the last few days, as everything is changing so fast.Next consider the age and health of everybody in your party. Do any of you smoke, that could make recovery from pneumonia difficult.Finally reflect on how you’ll feel visiting a country where you’re constantly reminded that there’s a serious infection around.Treat all advice with caution, everybody makes their own risk assessment, and on subjects like this, we all tend to be irrational. In the end, it’s your decision."
hi we are travelling to singapore on March 4th IS IT SAFE
"No, you get sprayed with virus as you walk on the street, then left there to die.Seriously, I'd advise you to read the constantly updated 658 threads on this topic on this forum. Read what is above before posting below! Or do you think posting the same question as everybody gives you 5 minutes of fame?Also read the news etc. Also, what is safe? 60 people infected in a city of 6 million? Safe for whom? Age, level of fitness?"

"best to avoid, not worth risking lives to a trip , until nothing urgent/important.is your trip refundable or reschedule may be?"
"Hi Ambassador679383Nobody can answer that question, it isn't totally safe, but nothing is. Look at my post, No 19 for more advice.Life here is going on as normal, we were on the beach at Palawan and it was quite busy this afternoon, more like it was before the crisis started.Later we went to Tiong Bahru Food Centre, and it seemed quite busy, but the drinks stall said it was quieter than normal.In the end you must decide for yourself. We all tend to be irrational when accessing risks (including me). But also do consider how long this crisis may go on, and how long we can put our lives on hold."
My daughter is traveling to Melbourne. Since she need transit in Singapore for 2 hrs. Is everything is okay in the airport? Do we need to have any extra care?
"Hi Leslie, the airport has many precautionary measures and cleaning has been stepped up at the usually meticulously cleaned airport. I don’t think there is anything to worry about but of course, nothing is totally risk-free. She should practise good personal hygiene and avoid touching her face before cleaning her hands.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapo…Edited: 8:59 pm, February 14, 2020 "
I too am travelling there in 2 weeks with my 6 year old and am concerned
"Seriously!!!!? Look at the numbers again, think....and please check the winter flu death that is not officially reported. Cheers!"
"Vasuda, it is generally safe here. People are cautious with some wearing masks, but no crazy paranoia except for a mere minority who hoarded supplies.If you think that you will be very concerned about your young kids and will not enjoy your trip in Singapore because of the constant worry, then you should cancel/postpone the trip.If you just want to spend some quality time with your family on an overseas trip, Singapore is fine and safe. Just be cautious and maintain personal hygiene. Don't let a few paranoid people scare you. ;)"
"Good advice from dracwy. My only comment is that you might become quite stressed trying to keep your little ones from touching surfaces and then touching their faces or sucking their fingers.Adults can understand and adopt personal hygiene measures more rigorously than children (well most can), and if you think that you're going to worry every time one of your children touches something, then perhaps delay your visit if you can.Good luck with whatever you decide."
echo that Susan
I will be travelling in March....looking at the present scenario how safe will it be in March?
"Hi Yash,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29426…Check this."
is it safe travel to singapore now because of coronavirus i have 1kid please kindly advice
"I cancelled our trip on April. The risk of getting the corona virus is probably low but I don’t want to deal with the hassle of going back to the United States being questioned or worse,quarantined.Also consider people wearing mask around you- it’s not what I want on my vacation, so I decided to cancel it."

"Vasuda - I think each person has to evaluate the available information and then make that decision for themselves. I canceled business trips to Singapore on February 19th and China on March 20th. With China the decision was easy with the USA level 4 - Do Not Travel Warning - United and two other USA airlines canceling all flights until May at the earliest. I watched the speech by Singapore’s Prime Minister which was great. I monitor the Singapore Ministry of Health website and other well-known Singapore media outlets. I also have 200 Chinese WeChat connections for discussion and information on Chinaand several WhatsApp and other connections in Singapore. I made the decision to cancel based on my age and the fact that I have asthma. United has already given me a complete refund on my China trip and will give me a complete refund on my Singapore trip based on a doctor’s note and a do not fly doctor’s order. So far United is giving complete refunds on tickets to China, Hong Kong and Japan but not yet on Singapore. I see many posts worrying about losing money as the key criteria for a go or no go decision. I would rather lose my money than my life even if the risk in Singapore is low. I will go to both China and Singapore once the epidemic is over."
"The authorities have advised us to stay away from crowded places .I take this to mean places , such as , the night safari , the zoo , bird park , and shopping centres . Where else is there for tourists to go ?I love beautiful Singapore and its ever so friendly people but I also have a wish to stay safe from the virus . Is there any idea as to when this blight will pass ?"
"Winston, you are asking a question that no one can answer, not even the ones working with the disease. Tourist attractions are less crowded now and cleaning is stepped up at public places so don’t worry too much as long as you wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your face before cleaning your hands."
"Hello, is is safe to travel now is singapore?"
What is the current situation in singapore? I have an upcoming trip this sunday.
"Today I had early alcohol time, great lunch and fun group outing. Cheers!"

Thank you for this..we are coming march 5th for 2 days and are concerned about how safe it is with this virus going around
"sagemeadows ... it is not clear that the virus is ""going around"" ... there are a few more infections each day, but these are connected to certain clusters; and not the Merlion (for example.) Random people are not turning up as infected.There are posts in the numerous Coronavirus threads, regarding how the virus is impacting their trip, from tourists who are in Singapore. You might look at these before making the decision that you feel most comfortable with. Personally, I just booked for Singapore. But it is your decision. Best wishes in any event ..."
"Absolutely safe! It is not as terrible as reported. In fact personally for me, now is the best time to travel with airlines promotions, plenty of sales to attract customers and less crowds! Everybody is vigilant and as long as you practise good personal hygiene, like washing hands regularly, use hand sanitizers and avoid sharing foods, pretty safe... Besides the virus is not transferred by aerosol (that is fine spray) rather by droplets (sneezes, coughs)... But at the end of the day, it is your call..."
"Marie Ang, Facts:1. Government set threat level to DORSCON Orange. “Moderate disruption, eg quarantine, temperature screening, visitor restrictions...”“Disease is severe and spreads easily person to person but disease is not spread widely and is being contained”2. 81 cases and rising. Jan 23 only 1 case.Confirmed: 1. Everything is still open. Nothing is closed.2. Some places have reduced opening times.3. Expected crowds may be smaller.To say things are “absolutely safe” is not only to falsely imply DORSCON GREEN, but to a newcomer is to encourage false sense of comfort increasing risk of non compliance with Government measures to reduce communal spread. Please consider this.Edited: 12:47 pm, February 18, 2020 "
Hi all I am going next Friday and the wife won’t to cancel the trip because of the virusIs it safe to go

"Hi Frank and welcome to TANobody can make the decision for you. In all probability you'll have a great time here, but there is a small risk.Look at https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294… and read up some of the linksMany recent threads on this forum are about the virus, so read some of them, again concentrating on the last few days, as everything is changing so fast.Next consider the age and health of everybody in your party. Do any of you smoke, that could make recovery from pneumonia difficult.Remember that this infection may be around for many months, decide how much of a change of lifestyle is appropriate over such an extended period.Finally reflect on how you’ll feel visiting a country where you’re constantly reminded that there’s a serious infection around.Treat all advice with caution, everybody makes their own risk assessment, and on subjects like this, we all tend to be irrational. In the end, it’s your decision."
"There are reasons to be cautiously optimistic. The number of active cases is down to 48, and 18 people have been discharged in the last four days alone. So far this week, the number of discharged patients have exceeded the number of new cases by about a 2:1 pace."
"@Frank P,Yes"
"CWB71, I like your cautious optimism. This thing is pretty fluid and can turn on a sixpence so key is keep monitoring."
"Thanku so much reading ur post, now m feeling relax and dropped my plan to cancel my trip"
"The situation has improved this week. There are only 39 active coronavirus cases at this point, and 27 people have been discharged this week alone."
"Hi I am also travelling to Singapore on 8th March, please let me know if you found something serious."
Supossed to travel to Singapore next Friday the 20th March and then onto to Sri Lanka. Would you if it was you?
"Hi there, I am doing the exact same thing except I am going 28May, five nights in Singapore then 15 in Sri Lanka, if I cancel of course insurance doesn’t cover, I’m hoping things improve by end of May , I have no idea what to do .Let me know how you go :) Karen"
">>Supossed to travel to Singapore next Friday the 20th March and then onto to Sri Lanka. Would you if it was you?<<You did not mention your origin country and final destination (if different from the origin). More than the Corona situation in individual countries, I would be more concerned about the decisions on travel ban/restriction that various governments are now taking. In the present situation, I will not undertake and travel unless absolutely must. I am also willing to bear losing money because of non-refundable bookings. Better than being quarantined or stranded in a country that is unknown to me."
"I think it’s far more than likely any decision making will be taken out of our hands.Quite frankly anyone that travels anywhere when they don’t HAVE TO is a fool.Why would anyone risk being isolated on arrival, then risk isolation on their return to their own countries.How could anybody “enjoy” being on holiday or away from their own homes during these most unusual of times, leaves me astounded."
"Best to stay put than travel here. SG Gov no longer pays for foreigners and tourists medical bill should you end up tested positive. All you get will be so call 5 star isolation room with special service to you either DIY or by robot serving you food, which ever more serious. Guess our Gov has realised that some people are abusing our generosity by being treated in SG.Our Gov is encouraging locals to go staycation, enjoy within the country to be safe.FYI, reported in local press today. Indonesians tested positive with the virus came to SG for treatment flying in on private jet. So can you imagine how locals would react to such news. Just wonder how on earth is going on."
"Yes if we were coming to Singapore now, we'd want to make sure our insurance covered covid treatment. According to a link from Minxbaby the room costs SGD450 a night. I 'd imagine you'd get a nurse looking after you, robots don't come cheap :) This is one problem with a holiday in Singapore, the medical costs will be higher than elsewhere in Asia.I heard about the Indonesians coming for treatment, but didn't know they came by private jet, I would have thought the cost of the jet would exceed the treatment. Can't trace the report, so BBmars1128 do you have the link?"
"Cases are spiking to 187 today. Got family and friends worried and calling me and asking how the situation is. They want to visit and delayed on my advice in the other thread. I've said being in Singapore is actually safer than getting here, but the risks of quarantine and costs, new cases outpacing recoveries, are another reason to delay."
"That article was written in Chinese, published by our Chinese paper, ""Morning Press"" (my translated name of the publisher)I had send the photo shot of that article to my group of friends.... all got angry why on earth they got out of the country and added into our covid19 counter. Someone posted a snapshot of the papers on our local Hardwarezone forum."

"Found the link, some rich Indonesianshttps:/…story20200312-1036486"
Thank you. That explains why the Singapore government backdated the change to the 7th.We have similar problems in the UK. A few greedy people ruin it for genuine tourists.
