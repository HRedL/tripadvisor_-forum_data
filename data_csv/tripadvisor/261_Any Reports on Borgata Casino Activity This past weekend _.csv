I have not seen any posts ( may be buried in another topic) about Borgata Activity since re-opening of Casino.
"I was there Sunday. You enter through the indoor parking garage and there is an employee who is managing the entrance. They did not check temperatures although there is a device above which I don’t know it’s purpose. There is a rope separating the people entering and exiting. The food places walking into the casino are open for takeout. There is a hand washing station available when you enter the casino and many hand sanitizers all over. The machine I played was very clean and machines were separated to accommodate social distancing. Going out the back doors the exit and entry are separated and an employee is there to check people reentering. There were about 3-4 food trucks outside. The pool and bar were open and people were at the tables around the bar. Food and drinks were served in that area. Also the downstairs Marketplace was open for takeout. The Amphora is now at the Borgata Gardens which I believe is the outside area next to the indoor pool. I couldn’t get in cause it opened at 4pm but the employee told me you get a ticket to enter. All the tables that I saw had the plexiglass separations and sat 3 at the black jack tables. Overall I felt very comfortable and as safe as you could feel while being indoors. Of course masks required, no food, no drink, no smoking. My next visit is this Wednesday."
Thanks so much for the update .
a report said 2 dozen nj life guards on beach have positive covid-19 tests.
Did it mention the towns the lifeguards worked at?

"Anythig Else about BORGATA ? Borgata does not have the advantage of boardwalk walk ins, so I was wondering what the atmosphere and experiences such as """" anti Brigantine, New.J reported. ."
