"Hello- The trip was fabulous but I have been sick for 1 month with the following symptoms: ( Doctors here cannot diagnose).Bite/ pinches all over body followed by itching sensation- cannot see anything. Finding small black pepper like things in my bed and on floor. After scratching long red marks appear. Small red tiny pinpoint marks on limbs. Also, small red marks that are about the size of a piece of rice on limbs.Eyes feel crusty, eyelashes and eyebrows shorter. Hair in pubic area being eaten away. Hard time breathing- must have fresh air and fan on all the time. Loss of appetite and loose stools.I did not swim in the river, took several hikes in jungle, ate cebiche in Lima at very good restaurants. Was with a good reputable travel company for 1 week- didn't drink any water that wasn't bottled.Any clues anyone???? I'd be so grateful.Have contacted several doctors and health agencies here.I am really getting frustrated. Thank you for your time.Elizabeth"
"Wow, sounds pretty bad. The skin problems --itching & streaks sound a little like scabies (a certain mite causes this), but I don't think that usually has the systemic symptoms you have. Have you consulted a travel clinic or a doctor with experience in ""exotic"" diseases -- i.e., diseases or conditions that aren't often seen in the U.S. because they originated from travel elsewhere?Sorry, I don't have any help for you -- wish I did.Edited: 9 years ago "
"Yow, Elizabeth, sounds miserable! In all of LA there's bound to be a specialist in tropical diseases. UCLA, maybe??"
Have you been to a dermatologist? tested to see if you have mites?I might try a dilute tea tree oil based soap/shampoo and see if that helps at all.
Sounds like the bedbugs that are becoming epidemic here in the US.
"I have checked today with a dermatologist, printed your descriptio and gave it to him.He says you need to go to a dermatologist, he thinks its a bite from a type of insect known as noseum. Not to worry much. Lots of your symptons are now being caused by your own anxiety. Calm down.You are having and allergic reaction buts its very curable."
"If you were in the jungle without any insect repellent it could be an allergic reaction to sandfly or ""no-see-um"". So try the Zyrtec tablets that you can get over the counter.I am sort of suspicious of this poster seems odd that no doctor could help her in Los Angeles!"
"Hi CC,Sorry for your troublewww.mdtravelhealth.com PeruCorrect info from CDC Travel MDs to help youLeishmaniasis from sand files is possibeScabies aka the ""7 year itch"" is also possibleparticularly if they itch lots worse at night.www.istm.org good Travel MDs with Tropical Medicineexpertise to help you..good Dermatologist with TropicalMedicine expertise would also possible be helpful.Do see a good MD specialist for proper diagnosis Get well Soon,"
Thanks all for your input but !!!!! I am for real and it is completely perplexing to me that I cannot find the help I need. Kafka- esque in scope.The leading Tropical medicine Doctor Claire Panosian is working 1 afternoon a week and it takes 2 months to get an appointment once she reviews your file and deems you acceptable. Dr. Teri Rock is not accepting any new patients. I was misdiagnosed for 2 weeks under the care of an Infectious Disease doctor who claimed all the delicious cebiche I had consumed caused me to have an intestinal parasite. I took a regime of Ivermectin and Albenza and still have all my glorious symptoms.Encountered yet another Infec. Disease doctor who claimed to be accredited with the Society of Tropical Medicine- not true ! He was also lazy and arrogant. Went to a reputable dermatologist and he had no answers- only a bill.Planning on setting up appointments with doctors out of the Los Angeles county area.This quest has been difficult and negativity or skepticism cannot be included in my mentality.Enjoy your good health.
"Crunchy, I hope you will share your test results and treatment when you have that information. It may be very informative for future travelers."
What happened with the noseum diagnosis ?
Perhaps will be less expensive and fast to get a diagnostic come back to peru and visit a clinic or hospital here. A doctor in medicina tropical.
