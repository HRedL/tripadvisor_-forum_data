I’m travelling to Jamaica from the uk end of April do you think there’s a chance my holiday could get cancelled?
the other multiple threads currently running haven't answered your question?
I haven’t seen any other threads regarding this?
Take a look at the Jamaica Ministry of Health and Wellness website:www.moh.gov.jm
"How could anyone here answer that question?Edited: 7:52 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"Indeed, with so many variable, unknowns, uncertainies, there is no way to answer that question."
Yes there's a chance. Jamaica is not allowing entry to travelers from several countries that have significant outbreaks. But the situation will be completely different in two months.
"well, Jamaica just did something very stupid. A cruise ship arrived in Ochi which contained travelers from Italy. The immigration & heath officers decided that all the passengers and crew could disembark except for the Italian travelers.Ref: jamaica-gleaner.com/article/lead-stories/202…"
"It was more i wanted to know peoples opinions, I know there is not a definitive answer to my question"
I am also traveling in April for Easter weekend. Canada has a few cases and currently no travel bans or restrictions from high outbreak countries. So yes I’m worried also that trip might not happen. Will have to wait and see as changes are happening daily
"Of course there's a chance. Just like there's a chance you could miss your flight. A chance of a hurricane. A chance of bugs in your room. A chance of catching a cold from somebody. A chance...oh forget it...post #5 sums it up, the specific probability is non zero, but unknown.Edited: 11:39 am, March 01, 2020 "
Yes of course. I suppose we will just have to wait and see what happens
"I am scheduled to travel from PA middle of May, I am getting nervous now that this trip may not be happening."
"I'm going to Negril 3/15 and am cautiously optimistic that things will go well, but I think its just a matter of time before a traveler from the US or Europe brings it to Jamaica."
"I think it is best to keep checking the government ministry of health and wellness website. If you have been or from North Italy, Singapore, South Korea and Iran you may not be allowed in. We are going from UK in June just hope we don’t end up on restricted list"
"I just took 6 airplanes over the past 2 weeks. I'm fine. My husband is fine.Not sure how different countries will be handling travel restrictions - not sure that they even know as far ahead to April.Its very much a wait-and-see, if it were me with a trip planned out of my country (I have many planned within my country in the next 2 months) I would not change my plans at all.Wash your hands - a lot.Edited: 3:43 pm, March 02, 2020 "
Yes I’m definitely going to keep everything booked as normal and just see what happens!
"Im traveling end of April for our honeymoon and im not to concerned. They have banned the 4 main countries from entering, but all can change in 8 weeks time and i reacon it will have calmed down a bit by then! Its flu guys, they are just trying to contain it, from getting about to much.Happy holidays."
"It’s not flu. It’s a novel virus against which we have no protections. Still, the majority of cases are not severe."

"You are correct! How does the M of H know that none of the other passengers are carrying the virus and introducing it to the Jamaican people. If it gets in Jamaica, I’m afraid for everyone!"
"I read an expert opinion that said travel bans don't work, they just delay the inevitable which gives everyone time to prepare."
"if travelling from the UK check the FCO website for health advisehttps:/…healthEdited: 8:36 am, March 05, 2020 "
I'm travelling in a few weeks too and concerned about if it's going to go ahead. Got my travel insurance in place and I'm just hoping we'll get a refund if it's called off.
"A lot of airlines are waiving their cancellation fees during this ""crisis""- I know American is doing so as long as you cancel before 3/31."
"Unfortunately travelling from the UK, if we change our mind and don't go we'll lose all of our money now which is a considerable amount. If an advise is given against travel to Jamaica then we'll get a refund. To be honest, I wish I could just be in the position to cancel it now and get the money back to use for a later trip when this has all blown over. My husband is asthmatic so in the 'higher risk' group an it's taken the whole shine off looking forward to going."
#27 have you booked through TUI?
Unless you're in a high risk group which is very small there is little risk. There is too much over reacting. There have been more flu related deaths this year.
"True but “the flu” is a general grouping of other viruses including our last epidemic- H1N1. It’s just no longer considered an epidemic on it’s own, but still as deadly. I’m imagining the same will happen with this one.Edited: 6:56 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"For anyone who may be interested, I called Beaches to inquire about their trip cancellation policy. I'm a bit stressed about our trip in May and worried that there may be travel restrictions put in place that would not allow us to come on our trip. Trip insurance purchased directly through Beaches comes with a Cancel For Any Reason waiver. I asked what that means and I was literally told I could cancel ""if my hair didn't look good that day"" lol. Basically you can cancel up to the day before travel for literally any reason at all, and you will get full resort credit in a voucher form that is good for 1 year. Airfare is a different story and is not covered by this waiver. Any cancelled airfare would have to fall under the Cancel for Covered Reason section, which is through a 3rd party company, Tripmate. In reading the Tripmate policy, it does not appear to me that imposed travel restrictions would be covered. I'm not sure if the airline would offer credit or refund in such a case but that is not listed in their standard cancellation policy. I called my airline (Westjet) and was told they can not predict or advise what different airlines would do in such a situation (which is fair at this point)."
Strange that the media has not commented on the virus in China the last few days. Could it be that it is contained?
"#32 I think ""reported cases"" are on the decline in China"
Exactly. Funny local news would rather report on a pandemic than focusing on the facts.
Huh? It is a pandemic. Even if the infection *rate* is declining in China it's increasing in some countries.
"I believe the WHO has declined to use the term, pandemic. However, I agree with the previous post. I’m not sure what it proves if there are fewer new cases in China and rising cases everywhere else. That it’s a media conspiracy or hoax? As broader testing becomes available, we’ll be learning about many more cases.Edited: 5:39 am, March 06, 2020 "
SLD98 yes Tui
I’m sure you can get some insurance via tui that allows you to cancel for any reason. So even if you’re still allowed to travel to Jamaica but you don’t want to you can get your money back for the holiday
"The Diamond Princess situation was an eye opener for me. Out of the 704 passengers who tested positive, 400 never developed any symptoms. That means there are a lot more that have it than we'll ever know. After all, who would get tested if they are feeling fine? That also means the mortality rate isn't as high as it seems."
"""Huh? It is a pandemic. Even if the infection *rate* is declining in China it's increasing in some countries.""Watch the cases in the US increase three-fold or more now that the CDC claims to be releasing 1 million test kits tomorrow...."
"There's an awful lot of snark coming from people who have nothing useful to contribute.I'm in the same boat as you and am following this closely. My guess is all of this is going to blow over suddenly once people stop freaking out over what is essentially a bad cold/mild flu.Unless you're old or have an underlying respiratory illness, you should be fine. Jamaica hasn't been hit very hard by this.Edited: 8:55 am, March 09, 2020 "
"One thing anyone traveling to Jamaica needs to consider (for anything, but in this case, for Covid-19) is do you trust Jamaica’s medical infrastructure and medical care should you need it when there. I have not yet cancelled an upcoming to Mexico. However, I would cancel a trip to my beloved Jamaica at this time for this reason."
"> My guess is all of this is going to blow over suddenly once people> stop freaking out over what is essentially a bad cold/mild flu.That guess is probably way off the mark - medical experts certainly look at it differently. This will blow over when the virus runs its course, hopefully mitigated by the precautionary steps that governments, organizations and individuals are taking. This is not a bad cold or mild flu - it's radically more deadly and contagious - but it will play out that way for people who are lucky enough to have good immune systems or social distance.It seems that Jamaica is taking very sensible steps, preparing for school closures if it comes to that, allocating funds and planning how it would handle an outbreak."
"Iriestar, #23. Why have you taken offense to my concern to all people on Jamaica, locals and tourists? I never said anything about Jamaicans not using soap and water and your insinuation is really sad! Next time, try a more positive approach. Jamaica doesn’t have the resources to give proper medical care to those with the corona virus. And, I seriously doubt all Jamaicans will go in hiding as you stated. Time will tell as more cases are sure to surface. After planning my Jamaican trip for over a year, I now have no regrets cancelling my mid April trip!"
"Who said i took offense? You obviously have an issue with me reply. My comment about soap and water wasn’t an attack..: washing your hands is the best way to prevent illness and we do that here.. not sure why all is a sudden washing your hands and practicing infection prevention is being treated like it’s brand new news..: it’s not. We have it on the island now.. and I’m still not worried about getting it. I’m more worried about dengue.Read this regarding the treatment of Corona.. I think we can handle some cetamol, fluids and cough syrup which is what 4/5 with Corona need... they would be tested where they are, not in a hospital https:/…drc-20479976Edited: 4:47 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"#46 TREATED where they are, not tested where they are."
"Traveling to Jamaica beginning of April. My concern is (from what I heard) they are checking your temperature before boarding your flight. If anyone has over 100.4 temperature you will be held back for 14 days. Sounds fun to stay but really that would not be good. 3 families we were with cancelled, we are still going at this point."
"""Jamaica doesn’t have the resources to give proper medical care to those with the corona virus. And, I seriously doubt all Jamaicans will go in hiding as you stated. ""How do you know Jamaica doesn't have the proper medical care for COVID? And on what experience or observation makes you doubt that Jamaicans will not self-quarantine if necessary? (Yeah, I know you said ""go into hiding"" which might be a ridiculous way of saying ""social isolation"")."
Best wishes! If I could go today I would. My July trip is feeling more and more on the bubble as days pass.
The first COVID-19 case was confirmed today in JAMAICA. A young lady flew to Kingston from the UK on March 4th and saw a doctor just yesterday. No details yet about which area she had travelled to for the funeral she had attended.

I'm curious to know what temperatures they are looking at for people as they arrive in Jamaica. I have 3 kids and they get fevers all the time for stuff...I wonder what their threshold is for temperature readings?
I plan to come to Jamaica in May from the U.S. Do you think the corona virus will interrupt my trip?
"If you're traveling from an area that has been exposed to the virus, consider postponing your trip to Jamaica. Please! Stay home until it's clear. I'm planning a trip this summer but will cancel if I need to. I will not be that person who brings the virus to Negril."
"Steve: I don’t think they set parameters.. but you can be safe to assume anything over 99 is considered a fever (low grade, but still a fever) And you’re correct.. kids run fevers for teething, ear infections and flu... but without a an exam and testing how would you know?? Think of it like is, if your child’s daycare, sitter or school won’t take them with a 99 temp, neither will we. It’s best to side on the err of caution."
We love you dearly but I recommend that you stay home for now. Our first case of Covid-19 is from a UK traveller and our little island is now struggling. Please come visit in December or so.
"Please follow Jamaica Gleaner, Jamaica observer and mcKoys news for updates. It is hard to say at this time."
It would be nice if they tested before you got on the plane.
Thank you
Travel has now been banned from the uk.
I think that was inevitable with the cases growing there.
Yes I agree I think it was for the best. will just book again when all of this blows over
"""It would be nice if they tested before you got on the plane.""Yes, it would be. I'm flying next week and I'd happily submit to a test before I fly and I'd appreciate my fellow passengers doing the same."
"It would be nice if they tested before you got on the plane.""give your head a shake.are the travel advisories or WHO declaring a pandemic not enough..CONTAINMENT will slow spread and give medicalfacilities time to prepare Test results at this time are 3-4 weeks in Canada.You can only be tested if you have travel historyor close contact with confirmed case and showing symptoms.. Or full blown symptoms....A little too late for random testing now.If you are sick DO NOT TRAVELthis includes>> sore throat >>>cough>>> fever>>body aches>> chest painpre-- existing conditions not limited to-serious stuffhigh blood pressure...diabetes ... heart issues..SMOKERS If you have been in close contact with anyone returning from other countries or outbreak area'sDO NOT TRAVEL within 14 days.....My opinion ONLYAnd yes I will be cancelling my up coming Easter trip.Flight will be in travel bank (westjet)Hotel has yet to respond ...The Spa Negril is offering credits as of today for anyone booked and wish to cancel.No I am not worried about catching this in Jamaicaat this point in time TODAY..As we have seen 1 case to 8 in less than a week.More worried about bringing it with me and I do not wish to be that selfish ..my short vacation may in fact take someone's life or put a huge burden on a family ..The Island isn't going anywhere soon .....Definitely will visit again"
“ More worried about bringing it with me and I do not wish to be that selfish ..my short vacation may in fact take someone's life or put a huge burden on a family.”Thank you for posting that.
"We were due to leave tomorrow and have had our holiday cancelled, like many I’m sad but understand completely as it’s the right thing to do because we don’t want to import any more virus cases to Jamaica.As many have said, the island will still be there in November when all of this is hopefully behind us all.“One Love”"
Yeah exactly Jamaica will always be there. I’m just confused at the minute though because on the TUI website they’re stating that the restriction is only for 14 days but I haven’t seen this information anywhere else? We’re due to fly 25th of April
Family trip planned for week of 3/23. Not sure if we should cancel because of coronavirus. Trip insurance doesn’t cover fear.
"""are the travel advisories or WHO declaring a pandemic not enough..""No. It's not. People are going to travel if they HAVE to (like me) or if they darn well want to (like many posting here and on FACEBOOK. Mandatory testing before flights will prevent anyone from getting on plane and traveling anywhere to spread this further. Positive Test - NO FLY.""CONTAINMENT will slow spread and give medicalfacilities time to prepare"". Here in the US where the response has been so incredibly slow I'm afraid we are beyond this. Mitigation and catch up is key.""Test results at this time are 3-4 weeks in Canada."" That's shameful and needs to be corrected yesterdayYou can only be tested if you have travel historyNo you can't. Not in the US at least. You must present symptoms and prove travel to one of the affected areas (Italy, China, Iran). The fact that I just flew back from Jamaica 3 weeks ago and Orlando 1 week ago with God knows who on the plane with me would preclude me from being tested, even if I did have a sore throat or a fever.""A little too late for random testing now."" DISAGREE. Now is the time where we SHOULD be testing randomly especially if we are not restricting travel or on lock down. We would be if we only had the tests. But we don't. And that's a failure of leadership, a failure of government a failure of human-kind."
I very well agree that everyone that’s sick should be tested. Unfortunately Canada or the US do not have enough kits available for testing. Also when you don’t have the confirmation it keeps the numbers lower than actual spread. They don’t have the facilities to process all those tests. Sorry edit*** turn around should be 3-4 days not weeks. ***Travel will soon be a mute point anyway. Airlines will stop flying planes. No travellers. No flights. March break started Friday. You could have shot a cannon thru terminal 3 at Pearson airport and not hit anyoneWas a ghost town. Not a lot of average folk can do a vacation. And then 2 week quarantine
Part of the problem is people going to get tested who think they have it and don't.The turn around will 24-36 hours when set up.Drive through testing is being set up here now with only 3 cases being positive.How long do you think the lines are going to be when all the hypochondriacs see the testing is open?
"""The turn around will 24-36 hours when set up.""The key words being ""when set up"". This should have been ""set up"" 3 weeks ago.I've said it before and I'll say it again - I would gladly submit to a test before I fly a week from Monday being a-symptomatic. I would welcome all my fellow passengers to do the same. This ""temperature taking"" screening is slightly helpful but not definitive and thus, BS."
"My trip is not till July so hopefully this will all be over by then. If I could cancel now without costing a lot I would but I’m on the hook for $1400 flight, 200 insurance, and 1000 for booking all non refundable from sandals. When my trip is closer I might cancel anyways. I don’t want to get sent back or even worse put in quarantine."
I would love to know also. we booked in june coming from the united states
Yep.
Now you see why.
"There's no telling when this will let up. Models and predictions are all over the place. Right now the focus is not having the hospitals blow up in the next few weeks. After that new plans will be hatched. Nothing is a sure bet until there's a vaccine or the virus loses momentum because of mutations, summer, whatever.Edited: 12:08 am, March 22, 2020 "
"Me to as was meant to be our honeymoon, but i think it will be cancelled, but im going to just change the date."
At this point I think all vacation are done til next year unfortunately. We just have to wait for our flight to get canceled because United won’t refund
yes
