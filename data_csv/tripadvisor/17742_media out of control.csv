I live near Toronto and the same thing was going on when the so called SARS CRISIS hit IMO as I said in another post there are more deaths from everyday living in any large or small city than any of these small isolated pandemics. When there have been outbreaks of salmonella type diseases in Ca nada and U.S I do not recall any warnings about visiting and by the way I am flying into Mexico City tomorrow and my biggest concern is about long lines as a result of the media fearmongering.
"You are right on the money.....Remember Mad Cow...The Jalapeno, Tomato outbreak, etc....You tend to wonder how bad it really is...My employees were sick more often than this so called epidemic hit. i live here, should I pack a suitcase?"
Dan I forgot about the Mad Cow. I guess we are among the few that wish to continue living without the paranoia that seems to exist amongst so many in today's society. I cannot beleive the number of threads and posts that seem to think the world is coming to an end and if it is as if we can count on elected officials to save us.
do you know how many people were shot in chicago last year? i didnt see any travel advisorys on that...and yes i live there i can say it.
"Hey Pedro, If they make you wear a mask in D.F. airport take a picture as part of your overall adventure. I was nursing in Canada with the whole SARS thing. I also thought it was incredibly blown out of proportion. So, many people die in ICU's daily of ARDS secondary to a community acquired bacterial pneumonia, but that is not blown out in the media daily. My good friend that lived here, traveled back home to Toronto last September. She got a bad cold, was in hospital within 2 days and in ICU the first day. She had pseudomonas pneumonia, she died within a week from it. This was a healthy woman that rode her bike everywhere and swam several times a week. Maybe she contracted it on the plane, but her case was not all over the news scaring the heck out of people from boarding a plane. She aquired this in the community. And for some reason that none of us will ever know, it overwhelmed her, as it has other people, but yet the majority of people do survive pseudomonas induced pneumonia. Some people are just more susceptible to infections and viruses than others. For instance this flu has not killed the entire family that have had a loved one die. For some reason this flu is overwhelming for certain people and is so difficult as there is so little detail being provided by the Mexican government as of yet. Some of the deaths (I am only guessing) could be due to the lack of medical care available and people waiting to long to seek medical care, or they seek medical care and appropriate medical care is not given. There is very good medical care here in Coz in case you should find yourself in need. As long as symptoms are managed early a person should be able to pull through a flu infliction. That being said there is no reported cases of swine flu here. Not to minimize the situation in anyway out of respect for the families that have had loved ones die, but the media hysteria is a bit much with all of these things medically related, it boosts ratings and sells more newspapers and economies suffer as a result. I hope we weather this as quickly as possible. I would say it is still very safe to come to Cozumel and I for one am not scared one iota! Wash hands and wash your hands some more. Funny at Mega all the staff were wearing masks (strictly a corporate precaution), but they are so irritating to the staff they constantly touch them and move them, it probably promotes spread of bacterial/viruses more!! Plus they are these silly little white paper thin flimsy masks. When protecting yourself from airborne viruses or TB you need to use pretty heavy duty 3M masks and wear them snugly. At the hospital I worked in we all had to be fitted by infection control for the masks that would protect the best, yearly. They would put a bubble over your head and spray this nasty stuff to see if you could smell it. Also a lot of teaching was done on how to wear a mask properly and make sure it was pinched over your nose properly. Pedro thanks for all your help at the Mega adopt day!! We had 3 dogs adopted! Osa, Campion and Lola went to new homes happily!! Andrea"
"The media is kind of doing us a favor if you think about it. For a couple of weeks (till something else to worry about gets reported) there won't be as many ""towel games""!"
I agree --at this point There is No Story !!! 
"Well I hate to break it to you Pedro but there is a travel advisory in a few countries warning about CANADA, and I'm pretty sure the same applies to the US since they have far more confirmed cases than we have. I hope I have enough food in the freezer & cupboards to be able to stay home until the danger passes. I wouldn't dare to go to town for groceries due to the pre supposed danger. OH WAIT; I went to the bank today, Oh well I guess I'm doomed. If I don't post for a while it's because I'm either in hospital or ""you know"". "
"Andrea,Sorry to hear about your friend.You are right on about handwashing, etc. Also about the proper mask fit and way to wear/use it. As a former Operating Room nurse, what you said in your post is right on. I would travel to Cozumel today and feel totally safe, if I wasn't going to PA for mother's day. Keep up the good work with the HS!"
"The more the media and govt. sequesters us from our own thought process, and to make us rely soely on the information that is sponned to us by media outlets, is basically our downfall and demise. My life here, by my desire to reside in Cozumel, has not been affected at all, but many travellers wishing to come here that have planned so hard and spent thier hard earned cash that heeded the advise and cancelled, and some to lose thier money by the spread of fear, as deefined as ""To be afraid or feel anxious or apprehensive about a possible or probable situation or event"" need a better voice. I am just one...Good night.... "
should I call in sick to work all week? I'm just sayin........
