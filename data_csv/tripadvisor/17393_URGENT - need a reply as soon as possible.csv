"we are off to SRLYM at 5am tomorrow , and our friends who are going with us have just phoned to say that one of them has a chest infection. they were told that they would not be let into cuba because of this. he is taking anti biotics and wants to still go as he feels ok. does any one know if this is true? my sister said they scan you when you get off the plane to see if you have a fever, but i dont remember that from last year,when there was swine flu about , but you did have to complete a questionaire about your recent health problems, i.e. have you had flu etc. hope someone knows if this is correct.thanks"
we were in Cuba the last week in octoberi acually had a bit of a cold before leavingHowever I was not asked any health questions or scanned for any fever as far as I knowThis was at the airport in Vararedo Gomez i think it's calledStill i am not sure of the rules regarding health issuesperhaps someone else can help with that
Is he contagious?
"While he may have no problem entering Cuba, he may want to be very careful while he is there. Some antibiotics can cause sun sensitivity, so he may need to be out of the sun completely – and that could go as far as staying inside. As well, remember that alcohol & antibiotics don’t mix. Getting ill during a vacation is one thing, but leaving on a vacation while ill is quite another (imho).Apart from that, having someone with a chest infection confined with a few hundred other passengers on a trans-Atlantic flight might not be a good thing! What does his medical professional advise?"
I presume it was just last year when swine flu was rife and they were all wearing face masks too. We didn't have to fill out a questionnaire this year and they didn't appear to be scanning anyone. Gill
I'm not sure whether they still scan for high temperatures on arrival now as it's been six months since I last visited but GillG has only recently visited.Personally I shouldn't worry too much about it. I'm sure he'll be OK. It's not as though he has a fever.Edited: 9 years ago 
"With leaving in the morning it's a bit too late to get medical advice, without going to the outpatients clinic at his local hospital, but that is more for accidents and emergencies."
"talk about an eleventh hour post!!!As others have said the scan was for high temperatures. the only other concern should be any escalation of the infection while there., proper coverage as well good luck and be safe."
"I would say go. If they have already started the antibiotics then that is the main thing, they are into the system.When we went in Oct, although to another airport they were not scanning.I would say to the person take plenty of decongestant, tissues and antibacterial wipes. This is to try and protect the others on the flight.I have had a chest infection, bad one as well while away and the heat on the lungs helps fantastically.My opinion."
Just back from the PP... NO scanning going on at the Holguin airport and no health questions...The extra protocol was only done during the Swine Flu epidemic.Go and enioy… The Budges
thanks for all your replies. dont think it can be infectious because he's had it all week and the doctor didn't sign him off work. as i said he doesn't feel ill like when you have 'flu - more a chesty cough. he's almost finished the anti biotics so with a bit of luck it will be gone very soon. i think nearly every flight i've been on there has been someone with a cold. i dont think he would have thought about it if someone hadn't said that cuba might not let him in.thanks again everybody.Edited: 9 years ago 
Might do him well to secure another batch of antibiotics - a friend travelled just after finishing a bought of bronchitis - felt fine at the time but the change in the temperature and the humidity brought it right back!! Thankfully he had another prescription of antibiotics with him and all was well!!! Always better to be safe than sorry!!!
"He will be fine, they only scan for high tempretures.A few cubian cigars will sort him out,Once you are out there, he will feel so much better, trust me I'm a doctor (not really)EnjoySteve"
he did go and get some more antibiotics to be on the safe side. i think that lovely cuban sun will make him feel tons better . he's managed to work all week so i'm sure he'll manage on a sunbed! as i said his concern was being stopped from entering cuba more than feeling ill.thanks.
Last week there was a half dozen nurses standing inside the Holguin airport watching new arrivals as they walked by in a line. No one was stopped or questioned. Guess they saw no actions by tourists that would hint at any possible health problems. So try not to sneeze or cough. Or spread any germs.
"Hi Lardy, My hubby and I travelled to Holguin on Sept 20th, prior to our travel my hubby had a chest infection that turned to Pneumonia, he was given the all clear to fly on the Wednesday before we flew on the Monday because his chest was clear. On the saturday before we flew I was at an emergency surgery because I had gotten a chest infection & knew I needed medication; I was given strong antibiotics to take which started to help my condition almost immediately. On the plane I was coughing and ""spitting"" a fair amount and felt like crap, just before landing at Holguin airport I covered myself from head to toe in Cooling Gel & then topped up again just before leaving the aircraft, I was petrified that the scanner would suggest I had a temperature... but alas I made it through. So long as your friend doesnt run a temperature Im sure all will be well for you all. Dont worry, go and enjoy!"
"BTW; They were still screening/scanning people on entry into the arrivals hall in september, the camera is on a tall pole above the computer screening station infront of the doors central in the room."
"Yes they were still screening/scanning people On Nov. 5th.I was coughing up a storm when I entered the arrival area (exit smoker for 5 months), but was not stopped by the nurses or the fellow on the scaner.Had a great week and did not start smoking again. Which is tough for me while in Cuba.David."
Guess the screening is here to stay.
"The scanner was in the hall, but neither on or being used. So maybe they have them there and use them as and when they feel like it.That was at Santa Clara in Oct"
"The scanner was still there but there was no activity around it at all. As others have said, probably best just to try to refrain from coughing until you've gone through!"
"thanks everybody. well they are going ahead because he feels okay and will carry on with the antibiotics and decongestant etc. like as been posted, he'll have to try not to cough or sneeze as we go through the airport! it's their first visit to cuba and are really looking forward to it so hoping it will be all ok. off to bed now for 3 hours sleep before the drive to the airport. will post a review on return.thanks for all the replies!"
Hope you all have a great time and do come back and let us know how you got on. It's been raining these past two days so I hope it's all cleared up by the time you arrive tomorrow.
"Dont use decongestants, let the antibiotics do the work...."
"3 Hours drive to the airport? Are you going by horse and carriage; you'll be there in a little over an hour and a half from Soton.....surely !!!!Dont worry FC always open their check-ins really early, you'll have lots of extra breakfast and shopping time..... I love breakfast at Garfunkels, have one for me !!!Edited: 9 years ago "
"Wow....is it just me? But, I hate being the healthy person on the plane sitting beside the sick, sneezing and coughing person. I don't want to sound too unsympathic because I know how disappointing it would be to have to miss a vacation due to illness after anticipating it for months. However, the flights are long and the quarters a close."
"CherylW50:So do we all, but you just can't cancel a holiday because of a cold. You would need a doctor's note to say you were unfit to travel to stand any chance of claiming on your insurance."
"I agree with you Bellagio, You do need a doctors note declaring you unfit to travel to satisfy any claim on your travel Insurance and a chest infection does NOT qualify. I know this info first hand based on our problems with hubby in September ~ He had been told he would not be allowed to travel with the pneumonia but was declared fit once his chest had cleared, I was at the doctors 2 days before we travelled with a bad chest infection and was told there was no problem with me flying; I admit to feeling very awkward with my coughing during the flight, it wasnt nice for the people around me but out of my control."
"hi everybody - thanks for all your replies before we went. our friend was fine ,barely a sniffle on the plane and it cleared up completely in the hot sun - so a storm in a teacup in the end! had a brilliant time - the hotel was just as good as last year, and we actually did more of the activities this time. only downside was a long delay at the airport yesterday to come home. we should of taken off at 5.15pm but departure was delayed until 11.30pm so a bit tired now. just checking my e-mails and found the latest replies to my question. our plane was replaced with a dutch plane that had no bar service,dutyfree or seat back entertainment and was much smaller than the firstchoice plane, but at least we got home! will write a review later but am a bit tired to do it now.thanks"
"I just came back from Holguin and there wasn't any scanning at the airport.FYI, also did not get asked for proof of health insurance."
lardyhead1:Sorry to hear about the delay to your flight home. Were you kept waiting at Holguin Airport all that time or was your departure time from the SRLM put back?I didn't check the departure times on Monday from Gatwick but I assume therefore the outbound flight must have been delayed. I know the outbound flight wasn't full but if the aircraft was smaller did they manage to board everyone at Holguin?. Glad your friend was fine and that you had a great holiday.
"hi bellagio - we were supposed to be picked up at 2pm but it was changed to 3pm. even so we were still much longer at the airport than we needed to be. they did give us a cheese roll and soft drink at 9pm, which was a bit late considering that they knew how long the plane was delayed(thomson/firstchoice). the plane came from holland and all the films were in dutch with subtitles.we couldnt buy a drink or dutyfree, but they did come round with cups of water and pretzels mid flight :-) so that made it a whole lot better. more of a concern was the legroom which was 28"" when it was supposed to be 33"". didn't make a lot of difference to me as i'm only 5ft but hubby is 6ft 2 so he didnt like it much lol!"
