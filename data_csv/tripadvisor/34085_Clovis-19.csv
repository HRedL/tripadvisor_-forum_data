Anyone know the status of Austria letting Americans travel with no quarantine this fall? I have been trying to research but canâ€™t seem to find information. Thank you!
The replies to your previous post still apply.
"i take it that you mean covid 19 ? anyway, the info as at any date, is clearly shown on the austrian govt website. but as the situation is fluid, it is impossible to say what the situation will be in the autumn. however, given the dire situation in the states, i would imagine that it is unlikely that you could travel. and dont forget the usa restrictions on returning. there is not going to be a quick resolution of the situation, so i would tend to suggest that you drop plans for a visit"
Thank You!
"I would probably rely on the information given on the website of the Austria Tourism Board, as well as on the one of the US embassy in Vienna, Austria.www.austria.infohttps://at.usembassy.gov/Edited: 2:48 pm, June 19, 2020 "
"Entry Requirements for US CitizensIn response to the public health threat associated with the spread of coronavirus, Austria has been suspending the entry of third-country nationals (non-EU/EEA/CH citizens) to Austria by air from outside the Schengen area since 11 March 2020. Exceptions apply.Exempt third-country nationals as well as those arriving by air from within the Schengen area will only be allowed to enter Austria upon presentation of a medical certificate confirming a negative molecular-biological SARS-CoV-2 test or committing to a 14-day self-quarantine."
"I doubt any European countries will allow Americans to enter until a vaccine is developed. Look at the current statistics. Infection rates have spiked and are higher in over half the states than the record numbers in March and April. We are not out of the 1st wave of the virus. Our government has not managed this well. It will get worse before it gets better and who knows what the 2nd wave will bring. I'm not a pessimist, just a realist. I had to cancel our 2 week trip to Europe in Sept."
