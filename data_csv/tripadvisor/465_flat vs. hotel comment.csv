"I'm trying to decide whether to rent a flat or stay in a hotel with a kitchenette on my next trip to London. Twice now I've rented a flat and haven't been able to go on the trip (the first time I had a serious illness days before I was scheduled to leave and the second time was the coronavirus). The first time I lost $2,000 (no travel insurance and they had a no refund policy), the second time I did, eventually, receive about 70% of the flat expense back. Lately I've been looking at hotels with kitchenettes. One in particular has a full cancellation policy if you cancel a minimum of three days before the scheduled arrival time. Considering how much money I've lost, this seems an attractive option. The flat I was going to rent before the virus hit was smaller than the hotel suite I'm looking at now. The price between the two are close - 16 pounds more per night at the hotel. The main difference is the cancellation policy! Something to consider."
Identification of the properties would help.
"I think you may have answered your own question. Based on my own experiences of the past four months, I would not touch a reservation of any kind that I was unable to cancel without penalty.. Hope your luck improves, well, all our luck. Stay well."
"I agree totally with fine mind, travel is on very shaky ground at the moment so it would be foolhardy to book anything without a cancellation plan"
I'm not sure what comments you want anyone to make. It seems you have decided already.
"As well as the cancellation policy, take out travel insurance to cover your trip.If your serious illness had happened after your arrival in the UK, it may have cost you more than $2000."
The answer lies in buying good travel insurance.
"I don't know about the US, but you won't find a new UK travel policy now which will cover cancellation for covid other than (possibly) because you are ill."
"This sounds less a flat v hotel than a cancellation/insurance policy.You should always have travel insurance (not just because of coronavirus, though many insurers won't cover for it now) and make sure you understand the rate conditions you're booking. Hotels do non refundable/changeable rates as well as flats though seem to have generally been better about offering changes/credit for future use."
"Re Covid19 and travel insurance: Trailfinders' travel insurance covers Covid19 at no additional cost. I've just bought some, and no, you don't need to have booked your travel with them.www.trailfinders.comEdited: 6:34 am, July 02, 2020 "
"I've just checked the Trailfinders policy wording, as any full travel insurance is worth knowing about. Under cancellation it says you are covered if you cancel because you are ill or you are required to quarantine because you have been in contact with someone who is ill, but ""This does not include any quarantine that applies generally or broadly to some or all of a population, vessel or geographical area, or that applies based on where the person is travelling to, from or through"". And no mention of being covered for cancellation if the FCO advises against travel.Yes, I am that sad person who always reads the small print.Edited: 6:57 am, July 02, 2020 "
#10 - thanks for the clarification
"Thanks everyone. I think after reading a flat v. hotel thread from several years ago - and currently considering it myself - I just wanted to hear what people thought about it in light of COVID and the general uncertainty of our times. I agree that travel insurance is important - I had it for this trip, but was contacted once the virus took hold and told me it wouldn't cover the coronavirus so they refunded the cost of the policy. I will make sure I have it in the future. The hotel I'm considering now is No 1 The Mansions. Big rooms, great reviews. I'm pretty sure I will give them a go. Appreciate your comments. Stay safe everyone."
"I think the main thing you need to do is be realistic about your booking. There's no likelihood of you visiting before October, travel after then relies on a huge improvement in the situation in the US and no fear of 2nd wave in the UK. Realistically any booking before this time next year is a big gamble."
"If you want to book something, then I'd make sure it was fully refundable. I wouldn't have expected travel insurance to cover a pandemic unless I paid quite a lot for that benefit. And that was before covid. After it, I expect any protection would now be even more costly."
