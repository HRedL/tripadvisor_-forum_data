"The Greek government have provided some clarity on the protocol for air arrivals - this is listed on the Passenger Locator Form website - https://travel.gov.gr/#/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++As of July 9th 2020, all travelers must complete their PLF at least 24 hours before entering the country, providing detailed information on their point of departure, the duration of previous stays in other countries, and the address of their stay while in Greece. In case of multiple stays, they are required to provide the address for the first 24 hours at least.Travelers will receive a confirmation email upon submission of the PLF.Travelers will receive their unique Quick Response (QR) code on the day of their scheduled arrival in Greece (at midnight) and will be notified via email (the QR code will be provided in a link in the confirmation email). If travel departure begins prior to the day of arrival, travelers are allowed to board after showing the confirmation email (and not necessarily the QR code which is scheduled to arrive during their trip.)Travelers are requested to show their QR code either on their mobile phone screen or in print.Depending on their QR code/confirmation, travelers are directed either to the screening area where they will be tested for the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 by a trained health team or to the exit, baggage claim area or passport control.The test results are expected to become available within 24 hours. During that time, passengers who are tested are advised to practise social distancing according to local guidelines and self monitoring for symptoms that could indicate COVID-19. In case of such symptoms, medical advice and/or contact with the National Public Health Organization (EODY) Operations Centre should be immediately sought. Only in case they test positive, the authorities will contact them and proceed with the health protocol in place. Otherwise, they may continue with their holidays, adhering to the general public health safety guidelines.If travelers plan to have multiple stop-overs in Greece, they must declare this and report their initial destination and their travel itinerary for the next 7 days.All travelers must comply with all of the necessary preventive hygiene measures (use of masks and physical distancing) according to local guidance.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
"Still missing the important information which everyone has been concerned about recent days. What are the rules if a passenger who sat nearby you, tested postive"
"Yes, I agree, but at least it clarifies a couple of big points. Hopefully clarity will soon come on your point and also on testing of children and providing own tests."
If we have already submitted the form do we need to resubmit ?I am assuming not but thought it better to check
"#3 - I don't think so, as long as you got an acknowledgement of the form being completedThe change from 48 to 24 hours allows them to accommodate people who are booking flights/holidays last minute/the day before Also they want you to complete the form as close to the 24 hours as you can in case any of your plans/details change between now and then - and to avoid a mass flood of forms being submitted"
Thanks Paul.
A lot of questions are answered here: https://greecehealthfirst.gr/
Nothing on there to say you have to quarantine if someone on the flight has tested positive
They are probably trying to stop people who are travelling weeks in advance from submitting forms early.I'd still be interested in knowing what is in the QR codes - maybe it says please test me :-)The timing for receiving a QR code is not great. By midnight you probably don't want to be trying to print anything off and that assumes you have access to a printer. And not everyone had a smart phone.
"Nothing on this article to say they traced the close contacts from the plane of the Greek doctor who flew in, just further down contacts within the group of 20 who travelled together.https:/â€¦"
