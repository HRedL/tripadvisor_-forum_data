"We will be arriving at LAX and then driving to our hotel in Westwood. Along the way, we'd like to pick up some groceries (toiletries, snacks, water, laundry detergent, etc). I'm not familiar with the grocery chains in the US - which ones would be reasonably priced with a decent selection, without having to go too far out of our way? I'm looking for the US equivalent of Waitrose (UK), Woolworths (Aus) or Countdown (NZ), basically.Edited: 4 years ago "
"We went to Ralph's Supermarket. Comparable to Woolworths. I can't open their website for some reason (it says access denied), but Google says there is one in Westwood."
"You have many options in Westwood Village. For groceries like food, go to Ralphs, though not sure about signing up for one their membership cards to get their special weekly deals. Trader Joes is a good small place with affordable foods that are more in the healthy line like organic. It is across the street from Ralphs. Whole Foods is the one of the most expensive chains but offer a different high end grocer. Only a few blocks away from Ralphs.But for general toiletries best to go to the Target Store in the same shopping complex on the ground level. Best to go here for everyday stuff but I believe this store has some groceries. Probably cheaper than Ralphs on many of the same items but Ralphs has more variety on foods while Target usually more on other items.. Also a CVS just around the corner from Target/Trader Joes and sell all the same brands as Target, but I think Target is cheaper. As with Ralphs, CVS using one of their membership cards will get you the weekly deals. The membership is free, I dont get the point of membership. But you can find what are the deals in each of the stores mentioned if you can find their online weekly ads using the Los Angeles zipcode 90024 if they ask.Edited: 4 years ago "
They will give you a membership card at Ralphs (or any other store that has one)Just ask for it.That gives you extra discounts on many items. The point of the cards are to make people loyal customers by encouraging them to come to that store.
It's quite possible will provide some of the things you need .... At no charge!Maybe check in first and see what they have.
"Which hotel? You could get to the hotel, unpack, then walk, depending on the hotel. If it's the W, walk to Trader Joes. If it's the Palomar, you can walk to Bristol Farms. If driving the 405, get off on Olympic and go to Ralphs."
"Just know that Bristol Farms is not reasonably priced! More closer to Whole Foods. By the way, all of our grocery stores, regardless of price points, have very good organic produce these days. Whole Foods merely upped everyones' game, so prices on the exact same brand and item (such as fresh strawberries) will be 10-40% higher at Whole Foods, Bristol Farms, Gelson's (I adore Gelson's when I have coupons). Another good bet for cases of soda and water, bulk items, cry-o-vac packaged meat (like a whole brisket or a whole NY strip that you cut into steaks) is Smart N Final. Think of it like a small Costco without a membership fee. There's one on Pico, another on Santa Monica Blvd., close to Westwood. Probably the best prices for cases of water and soda."
I strongly agree with Elle (#5) that you should not be going to a grocery store with luggage in your trunk (boot). Drop the bags off in your hotel first.
"We always go to a grocery store with luggage. It just means one of our party needs to keep an eye on the car. Unless you are solo, this is not an issue at all."
"if it's not an issue, then why does one of your party needs to keep an eye on the car? Car break-ins have become an epidemic in California. Even if one does not leave anything visible, thieves can identify and target rental vehicles. There is nothing worse than having your car broken into when you just get off the airport. Better safe than sorry."
"There is a Trader Joe's and Target City (has decent groceries at good prices) right in Westwood. Depending on your hotel, you can most likely walk there and not have to deal with parking, luggage, etc. There is also a Whole Foods, which is not known for affordability, but does have good quality and prepared foods."
"Wow. I had no idea that car break-ins were THAT common in LA, thanks for the tip! Though that does worry me a bit, because we have some of our itinerary planned with luggage in our trunk, e.g. Santa Monica on our last day in LA. Is there a better way to protect our luggage in that case?We are staying at Azul Inn Westwood. Organic/good quality food is really not high on our priority list when we are on vacation. :) So I guess we should go to Target? Do they have parking for customers? We could drop our luggage off at our hotel and then go there, if parking isn't an issue?"
I'd like to see some data showing there is an epidemic of car break-ins in LA. I have not worried about the issue for more than a couple of decades. Am I missing something?
Target and all the supermarkets have large parking lots. I prefer a regular supermarket since they tend to be less crowded although Saturday is always a busy day anywhere. Also most supermarkets have fresh delis and bakeries.
"I think TSS is confusing the crime wave in SF with the rest of the state. SF is having that problem because it has so many homeless people living right next to major tourist areas. In LA there are some homeless living near Hollywood and Santa Monica, but the vast majority are concentrated around Skid Row because that's where all the services for them are located. It's a really long ""commute"" from there to the areas with lots of tourist attractions."
"There isn't an epidemic, but there is an uptick in car break ins during summer months and during the Christmas holiday season. California is seeing more visitors, and the bad guys know they have stuff. At Christmastime, those bad guys target single family neighborhoods and SUVs/Minivans. I've a neighbor who lost all the kids gifts by hiding them in the car.Here's some local info on car break ins over the past few months.lapdonline.org/crime_prevention/…7758…cbslocal.com/2016/…abc7.com/news/…wehoville.com/2016/…Theft from vehicles in Hollywood is 33% of all property crimes: …latimes.com/neighborhoods/…You can look up those LA Times crime stats for all LA neighborhoods if you like. Here's Venice:…latimes.com/neighborhoods/…Where 26% of property crimes are vehicle thefts, and all other theft is 41% (keep your cell phone in your pocket and lock that bike!).Edited: 4 years ago "
"Back to groceries. I lived in Westwood for a while and have business dealings there. Your motel is not really in Westwood (it's just south of it in the West Los Angeles neighborhood). If it were me, I'd go to Sprouts which is very close to the Azul -- closer than any of the other places mentioned above (although all of them are perfectly fine -- beware, though, Bristol Farms is expensive and whole Foods is somewhere in between the others and Bristol Farms in terms of cost. But Sprouts is kind of a healthy place and won't have detergent.The shopping complex where Target is located is a real pain, imo, to deal with. Parking always seems to be in high demand with packs of cars driving in circles looking for a space. Then, as I recall, you need to queue up to exit (so that you can have your parking tickets processed -- if you don't have Target or Ralphs stamp the ticket, you have to pay for parking). BTW, that's not a Target Store, there. It's a 'Target City"" store which has three differences vis-a-vis regular Targets:a. It's smallerb. It tends to have 'local merchandise, e.g. apparel with logo of the local Universityc. It's more expensiveSo, even though Target is a relatively inexpensive chain (although Walmart and K-mart are cheaper still). ""Target City"" is about 10 or 15% more expensive than Target.So, since you're staying in West L.A., I probably wouldn't go into Westwood to shop. Instead, I'd stop somewhere between the airport and your motel. One area that comes to mind is the shopping area at the corner of National Bl and Sepulveda Bl in West L.A. Here is a map from LAX to two side-by-side stores in that shopping center -- a Von's Supermarket and a CVS 'Drug Store'.Von's is the least expensive, major supermarket chain in Southern California and will have everything you need. CVS is a major 'drug store' chain which will also have detergents, toiletries and water/snacks (as Vons would have) so you might compare the two (as sometimes, one will have a big sale -- especially on water or other beverages). Lots of free parking in front of the stores and they are 'on the way' to the Azul."

"My experience at the parking by the Trader Joe's had been the same as HSJ. I like Sprouts. Kind of a mix of TJ and Whole Foods.Or... you can hit up my old neighborhood corner. There is Trader Joe's and CVS in the same lot at Sepulveda and Palms. Ralphs used to be across the street but looks like they closed. There is a Vons on further up on Sepulveda as well on National with a CVS. Parking there is infinitely better than at Westwood. That was my pharmacy at CVS and I have never had problems with parking there though it was a few years ago. From LAX if you take 405, the Vons at National is right off the offramp and very easy to take side streets to your hotel. Has everything you need and then some. Trader Joe's has neat snacks but probably not worth detouring on your first trip. Go back later.Edited: 4 years ago "
Your hotel is not in Westwood. It's nearer century city.
"Sorry, I have appeared to have omitted the link to the map I referenced in #16http://mapq.st/2bPGGCk"
"<There is Trader Joe's and CVS in the same lot at Sepulveda and Palms.> It's my favorite TJs! And the grocery store across the street used to be my favorite Albertsons, but they had to sell their westside properties when they merged with Von's or something like that."
Lol Plumeria! Yes it was Albertson not Ralphs. That was pretty much my routine. Get stuff at TJ and then Albertson across the street. It was technically walking and biking distance from our old grad school era apartment. But let's face it... no one walks in LA. :pEdited: 4 years ago 
"Thanks all! And thanks for the map HopSkipJump, but I think after reading the advice here, it would probably be safer to drop our luggage off at the motel first before shopping? So would prefer to shop close to the hotel instead of on the way. That seems to rule out Sepulveda & Palms or the Von's that was suggested...So I guess we're stuck with Ralphs or the Target City in Westwood? I don't mind paying a few dollars more to avoid spending a lot of time driving and looking for parking, especially as we'd be coming off of a 12 hour flight.Edited: 4 years ago "
"Sprouts is closest to your hotel. You can practically walk there. There's free parking I think.https:/…275Otherwise, the Ralph's on Olympics will have easir parking. If you are coming when UCLA is in session, it really is a PITA to deal with that parking lot at Westwood. But if you didn't mind that, go for it."
"I think someone said that Sprouts does not sell detergent?Ralphs on Olympics sounds good if getting parking is easy, is that neighbourhood safe?"
"I am pretty certain Sprouts sells detergent. It might be phoshpates free 7th Generation type but they should have it. Unless something has drastically changed in the past few years, that Ralph's on Olympics is fine and safe."
"You won't be going to any unsafe parts of LA, which are mostly far south of tourist areas. Westwood is particularly safe.In fact, the Ralph's on Olympic is a beauty - huge, clean, well kept, and right next to a Trader Joe's. The TJ is not my favorite, as the parking is on the roof and the store is not, so elevators and stairs have to be negotiated, something I really don't like with a shopping cart! Don't try to leave your car at Ralph's and walk across the street to TJ's, your car will be immediately towed."
Thanks guys! Ralph's on Olympic it is. :)
"Just to be clear, I was talking about the Ralph's on Olympic and Century City, not the one on Olympic and Barrington with the TJ across the street. But either way, the one at Century City is safe."
