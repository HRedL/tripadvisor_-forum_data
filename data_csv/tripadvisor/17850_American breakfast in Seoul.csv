Are there any places to get an american breakfast near but not in international hotels in Seoul and also in Busan? Thanks
This one in Hongdae seems to serve 'okay level' breakfast.https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Revie…
"I will tell you the Novotel Ambassador Hotel Busan breakfast is horrible. They do have bacon, eggs, omelet, etc but everything taste horrible and is over priced. There are a few places, I wouldn't expect it to be good.Does anyone in your group have access to the U.S. Army base in Seoul? Their Green Street restaurant has a fabulous breakfast buffet. We use to eat there almost every Sunday. This past July we ate breakfast there twice (were guests at the hotel). https:/…greenstreetThe USO (which is off base) had a great breakfast sandwich, but I haven't ate there since the early 2000's so I am not sure what they do now. When I googled, it looks like they no longer list the Seoul office as a location.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Absolutely TONS of places these days, not in hotels. Look for Flying Pan they're a common brunch place. Also Butterfinger Pancakes. The Original Pancake House. Pancake Epidemic Seoul. Suji's COEX. Just do some Googling Itaewon Brunch, Seoul brunch, you'll find stuff no problem."
Many thanks to all.
"Indeed, Flying Pan is a very nice place!"
