"Our hospitals are full. Do not trust TA posts please! Some are false and misleading. I buried 2 in US today and 1 in Guadalajara 4 days ago. Trust, but verify. You are welcome to PM me in Guadalajara here. Stay home please."
I’m really sorry for your loss. Covid19 is real but life goes on. We just visited San Miguel de Allende with proper protocols to see friends staying there. I hope your life can get back to normal soon.

"I agree with you whole heartedly. The US State Department has just upgraded their travel advisory to México to Level 4 - Do Not Travel. As ironic as that is, since USA passport holders can now only travel to México, Libya, and Turkey due to the virus, it is true. Now is not the time to travel."
Www hasn’t it been level 4 for several months? I saw the update before but I’m pretty sure it was a 4 since idk April May?
"Pancho,Sorry for your losses. I wholeheartedly agree with you and the others (so far), as NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO TRAVEL TO MEXICO.Sadly too many ppl feel self-entitled to be able to vacation when and where they can afford, regardless of the health implications to the Mexican Nationals. Although one might test negative, be asymptomatic and quarentine prior to travel, travelers just come in contact with too many others enroute and may still carry the virus to Mexico unknowingly. For the sake of the country and the people we all love that live there, PLEASE DO NOT TRAVEL TO MEXICO AT THIS TIME. PERIOD."
"Going back through all my email updates from the Mexico Travel Advisory(s).8/6 emailThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Level 3 Travel Health Notice for Mexico due to COVID-19. 7/29 email The Department of State issued a Global Level 4 Health Advisory for COVID-19 on March 19. I get all the updates as well, & was alarmed by the email today stating a level 4. Then I looked back & seems to have been a 4 for awhile?"
"And CNN posted this today, I am so confused did the Travel Advisory change at all?US State Department lifts global 'Do Not Travel' advisoryhttps:/…index.html"
Sorry for your loses Pancho. I have tried to tell people on here about the hospitals. Alas they will only listen when someone close to them passes from this horrible virus. Stay safe. If everyone would just wear masks and wash their hands. Sigh.
Totally agree with post 2.
Same as post #2. Stay home.
Panch04 - Posting to express my sympathy for your losses. I am very sorry. Thank you for sharing the sad news here so others can get a better picture of reality there.
"Pancho...please direct your message to the people of Guadalajara, Zapopan and Vallarta...tourism doesn't cause the spread, but the people who party or gather in large numbers without masks and proper distancing."
"Well, said, # 13."
"Travelers certainly do help spread the virus, otherwise it would never have left China.Don't be part of the problem."
terriks...travelers DID help spread the virus when nobody knew about it ...the situation right now is totally different...the world had most of the cases AFTER travel stopped...i think about 90% of them ...don't be part of the problem.
"The virus is still the same, and just as infectious."

That is indeed very sad
"Only 8 countries will let Americans in without any restrictions: North Macedonia. Kosovo. Tunisia. Turkey. Dominican Republic. Mexico. Maldives. Serbia. To the rest of the world we are a plague. They’d rather we just stay home & celebrate our God-given right to not wear a mask.When will Mexico (or PV) join the rest of the world. PV has weeks to mask up, distance etc during this low season rainy season to flatten the curve and welcome visitors.If the current USA situation isn't similar to most of the world by then, well restrictions will still be needed and be applied. Opening up and not doing the right thing might be the downfall of high season."
HalD. Exactly what I’ve been saying for weeks. Thank you.
THank you Hal D for such a great post. Great to hear some people have some common sense.
Alunelkook. All I see now when you post is Blah Blah Blah. You can save your time responding to me.
What #25 said.I agree. A trouble maker.

"Hahaha. And trying to stay relevant using new hip slang is not making you look any smarter. Those names are used exactly the opposite of what you are insinuating. Talk about pot/kettle, someone does need to draw some pictures. Do not bother replying, you still have not come up with an answer to the airline thread, or have you started so many fights you have lost track?"
"Totally agree! Unnecessary travel rn is extremely selfish. It's mind blowing to me to see people doing trip reports and others commenting on their post encouraging them to try different restaurants etc. Hold others accountable.Edited: 7:49 pm, August 11, 2020 "
#21 and #25. Thanks for you wise words.
