Sadly in covid19 transmissions.
"The most shocking thing about it is that some people are going to be shocked.Allowing casinos to open to soon will just set Vegas back even further.There needs to be hard and fast rules that are strictly imposed as ""asking"" or ""recommending"" that people follow guidelines is a waste of time. Too many have adopted their own rules that ignore the safety of others."
Arizona is in worse shape. It has 100% ICU usage as well as a high infection rate.
"Not sure what criteria they used, or who they are in fact, but I don't agree. Which is not to say Nevada's numbers this past week aren't very very bad of course, just that they have lots of competition.My guess is casinos are trying to get through July 4th weekend and then we'll start to see closings. Which if that's the case is simply incredibly irresponsible."
Any comments from the Mayor of Las Vegas?She did not even want a shutdown.
"more cases are being reported due to exponentially more testing being conducted. shockernotice how the ""news"" stories mouthbreathers keep consuming keep talking about cases, but almost never about deaths? i's because the death rate is going down crazy fast. 9 weeks in a row of decreasing death rates, and almost zero risk of developing serious complications except for an infinitesimal fraction of the population truly at risk. these facts are too much for crazies to handle, though, and they're all too happy to just let others think for them. it's very sad. again, table 1 of this page is just a starting point. i highly recommend spending some time looking at different parts of the cdc's website, including all of the pages about serology. i won't give up hope that more people will start to think for themselves rather than letting others do it for them:https:/…index.htm"
"Not sure what you mean Mr. Nice Guy, but I count at least 9 states that have reported more Positive tests than Nevada in the last 7 days, probably more.Edited: 2:20 pm, July 01, 2020 "
"""more cases are being reported due to exponentially more testing being conducted.""Nevada's testing in the past two weeks is in fact down 30%.""the death rate is going down crazy fast""Death rate by the time of reporting lags new cases by a month. NONE of the current figures reflect the spike that is ongoing in many states. Yes there is ample reason to believe the CFR will be lower than in April, but the way Covid deniers seem to act as if Covid has magically stopped killing people is yet more willful stupidity."
"""Any comments from the Mayor of Las Vegas?""The way LV's government is structured means in regards to Covid, Mayor Goodman's opinions carry as much weight as those of espnawards."
"I understand that the facts I state are anathema to the delusional scenarios that non-thinkers have created in their tiny brains. Instead of celebrating the fact that we’re about to hit our 10th week of declining deaths due to coronavirus, these insane people actually hope the number will increase. Why? Because they desperately want to be “right”. Not sure what else to expect from people who accuse anybody who disagrees with them of murder, or who outright state that they hope people who disagree with them get covid 19 and die. Both of those things have happened multiple times on here by the garden variety morons who shriek the loudest and most often. https:/…index.htm"
"""I understand that the facts I state""You are not stating facts, you are citing data. Learn the difference Mr. Teacher."
"the cdc thinks that approximately 17 million more cases are out there than have been reported, which means that 7X as many people have gotten it and developed zero or mild symptoms compared to those that have been tested. it got attention for 1 whole news cycle since it wasn't as sensational as the clickbait that mouthbreathers love to consume. of course the number of reported cases is going to go up, which is effectively decimating the death rate.and a lot of epidemiologists and serology experts think that number is low. again, these facts are incomprehensible to crazies who just make up numbers like ""tens of millions dead"" from the resident king of crazies, or ""1000 people a day are dying"" a couple of weeks back when people were talking about the circa opening, when it wasn't even close to accurate or based on any fact whatsoever.Edited: 2:35 pm, July 01, 2020 "
"Oh, I get it now. Stop testing and there are no cases to report, therefore no problem. How did I not see that?"
"""the cdc thinks that approximately 17 million more cases are out there than have been reported,""No they don't. This has been broadly mis-reported. Read the actual study. It was conducted in April when testing was minimal. It looked at 6 regions, in 3 of the 6 hardest hit areas including NY they found that, once again in April when testing was 20% of what it is now, there may have been 10X as many cases. Somehow that got reported as applying to the entire country in May. That is nonsense. I could take 2 of the other regions at the time that had no more than 20% unreported cases and claim that at most today there are only 450,000 un-diagnosed cases. The exact same logic applies. But I won't because that would be stupid."
this is the one i was talking about who was telling people who disagreed with him that he hopes they get covid 19 and die. i wish i were exaggerating. sad.
"To elaborate on what the OP is referring to, the infection rate is the ""R"" number, currently showing as 1.48 for Nevada on the following website.https://rt.live/us/NVThere is a more empirical measure that has been discussed ( the 7-day average), which is showing to be 15% for Nevada at this time."
"""this is the one i was talking about who was telling people who disagreed with him that he hopes they get covid 19 and die.""Are you implying I said that? Or even implied it? Even once? Do tell."
Thanks for that like rallen. Interesting way of looking at it.

"Going into the holiday weekend, Nevada is still number one. In new developments, several Bank of America locations in Las Vegas are closed due to lack of staffing, and Apple stores are closing. https://www.ktnv.com/news/coronavirus/data-n…"
Is there anything else to think about instead of COVID all the time? It seems the usual bunch is still terrified and feels the need to spread the news. Don't y'all want to take a break?
Thanks for bumping this up from yesterday. It will help spread the news.
Hominuk still feels the need to spread the news about people who spread the news. Doesn't she want to take a break?
Start spreading the news...I’m leaving this scene.Don’t want to be a part of this ..Covid 19...
"These vagabond shoes, are longing for hygieneRight through the very heart of it....Covid 19"
"""So when we have a lot of cases, I don't look at that as a bad thing. I look at that as, in a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better.""So I view it as a badge of honor. Really, it's a badge of honor.""dtrumpEdited: 10:43 am, July 03, 2020 "

"HominukM, fwiw I have no problem with you bumping this or any other thread, but I think whatever side of the divide one is on it's not about being terrified of the virus. It's about wanting this to be over as soon as possible, and differing passionate views about the best way to achieve that.But I understand anyone being fed up with the fact that this subject is dominating the forum. Heck, the new post today about the status of the WAX bus was actually quite refreshing!"

"Japan: 126,000,000 Deaths from coronavirus: 975"
"You are all entitled to own opinion, based on your own research, and through your own sources. I agree mostly with espnawards. Like the underreported Swine Flu animal borne Flu, the death rate percentage is low compared to the number of actual cases. Covid counts are highly inaccurate. Why are nursing home deaths, which made up a large percentage, considered Covid deaths if any symptom exists at death even though they are not tested? Why are the antibody tests considered a new Covid case and not a recovered Covid case? Why are we having this reaction when it was largely ignored in 2009. I'm not suggesting this is not dangerous for those with compromised immune systems, especially in the elderly since it takes time to develop a vaccine. Remember over 60,000 people died two years ago in the US from the Flu with a somewhat effective vaccine, and those numbers were probably under reported. You may or may not agree with me, but I have compiled a lot of information from a lot of various sources and have the background to provide a qualified opinion."
