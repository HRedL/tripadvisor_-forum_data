"Does anyone know if Zika is a problem on St. Thomas? I read a hotel review where a person stated Zika is widespread, but that is the first time I've even heard Zika mentioned recently.Thank-you"
"The CDC stopped giving updates many months ago when the epidemic status passed. As far as I know, no new cases have been reported for a long time. Hope that helps!"
"I was last in St. Thomas in November. Got bitten pretty bad. Just to be careful, bring plenty of repellent. Have not heard much about Zika lately, but you can never be too careful. I will be going back next week on business and will update as to the mosquito levels."
The mosquito population is entirely dependent upon the weather. Eggs are laid in the bush and hatch when it's wet so heavy rainfall produces more hatching. Deet-containing repellent should always be used particularly by visitors who haven't developed immunity to local mossies. They can carry not only the Zika virus but dengue and chikungunya so always make sure to protect yourself as much as possible.
"This was updated last month - if it's a concern, I'd probably wait to travel :(https:/…zika-virus"
We just returned from St Thomas and have many bites even with deet repellant spray
No new cases have been reported for almost a year.
Erin - if you suggesting people wait to travel to the Virgin Islands based on that post I think it would be fair that you include the fact that parts of Texas and Florida have the same risk.https:/…zika-virus
I was hoping to come visit USVI's for my baby moon at the end of the month... I live in Florida and Zika has not been an issue for quite some time. Upon researching the CDC website it does state not to travel to the islands if you are pregnant :( Has there been any recent cases?Thanks.
Same response as earlier - there have been no new cases reported for almost a year.
Where you staying on land or were you at sea?
https:/…2018-case-counts.htmlThis website shows two counts of Zika in the USVI in 2018. But I guess that could be St John or St Croix...?
Thanks for the updates. Do you mind pointing out the source of “no new reported cases”? I was reading about how CDC removed the observation center. Thanks again.
"The CDC hasn't listed the dates of the two new cases but as of August 1, 2018, 2 cases were reported in 2018 in the whole of the US Virgin Islands (population 2018 estimated at 105,000). One might also take into consideration that the hurricanes of September 2017 were accompanied by a huge amount of rainfall which in turn resulted in an explosion of mosquitoes in the ensuing months. If the mosquito-borne viruses were a major issue, one might extrapolate that cases of dengue, chikungunya and Zika would have risen dramatically under these extraordinary circumstances but such was apparently not the case.https:/…2018-case-counts.htmlEdited: 2 years ago "
