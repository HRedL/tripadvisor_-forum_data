What’s the situation like in Ipoh on covid19? I understand majority of cases are actually in KL. Are masks also out of stock in Ipoh?
"We were there 10 days ago already so I'll leave a more current update to others. However, ""Are masks also out of stock in Ipoh?"" is something I can address.If you yourself are sick with flu, covid19 or other air-borne contagious disease then you should stay home and not travel hoping to find appropriate masks once you get to Ipoh. If you are a medical practitioner heading to work or volunteer in a hospital in Ipoh then I'm sure they'll supply you with masks.However as is likely the case and you are a normal traveler planning on visiting Ipoh then YOU DON'T NEED TO WEAR A MASK!Your profile says you are from Singapore so here is what your Ministry of Health is saying:""Those who are unwell should wear a mask and see a doctor immediately. But there is no need to wear a mask if you are well.""Source: https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19 If you don't trust your own government you will find the same advice on authoritative governmental and semi-governmental public health websites all over the world.The World Health Organization:""If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection.""Source: https:/…when-and-how-to-use-masks Let's stop this silliness. #getinformed #stopthehysteriaEdited: 3:54 pm, March 11, 2020 "
