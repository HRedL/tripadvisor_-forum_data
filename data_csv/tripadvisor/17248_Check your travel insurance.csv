"we took out travel insurance when we booked our dream holiday in June 2019. But at present we cant use travel insurance to cancel unless our govt declares it no travel. We have been planning a two month trip of Europe for a year. we leave next month. We have prepaid all airfares, accommdodation, tours etc. Its too expensive for us to cancel and lose our savings. So far our expenses are close to $20,000 and we would lose that. But Italy is where we are spending the bulk of our time and northern italy is our first place to visit, we dont want to be quarantined in a country where we dont speak the language, dont know anyone or arent familiar with hospitals. But we cant cancel anything or make any changes unless airlines cancel or country closes its boarders. Not a good position to be in from the bottom of the world.However, if the WHO declares coronavirus a pandemic or epidemic we can then cancel and get refunds for all our bookings. Be aware that many many travel insurance policies have an exclusion for pandemics or epidemics, and some dont even have cancellation insurance."
""".. if the WHO declares coronavirus a pandemic or epidemic""Given the way the WHO has been dealing with the novel coronavirus, I wouldn't bet on that."
"I checked my trip insurance policy for my upcoming trip in March to Spain. The policy specifically excludes claims of any sort due to epidemics. So whether the airline stops flying or I get sick in Europe or my return is delayed due to an epidemic-related quarantine, I am NOT covered by my policy. As a traveler you need to know what your coverages are before making a decision. I doubt any insurance policy covers cancelling your trip simply out of fear - fear of getting sick or stranded. That said, I do think at least some airlines will relax their refund or change fee policies during this time, assuming it becomes safer in some number of weeks or months to travel. And at this point, absolutely no one knows how quickly or widely this epidemic will spread."
"You still have at least 3 months to learn some basic Italian and buy a small phrase book to take with you (they usually have medical sections). I don't know about where you live, but where I live our govt's foreign office publishes info on all the different countries, including info on how local health systems & hospitals work, with lists of local English speaking doctors and other providers. Also, where I live trip insurance policies not only provide coverage for illness on your trip, they provide emergency assistance in locating appropriate care and translators if necessary, SO READ YOUR POLICY. In addition, your country's local consulate is there to help in emergencies. Don't forget that.You also have time to look into what it might cost you to just CHANGE you arrangements to a later date. Also keep in mind a lot can happen between now and June.Edited: 7:52 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"#3 we leave next month, we booked in June 2019. and are travelling france, germany, croatia, italy, singapore. i dont think learning all those languages likelyprevious poster, we leave march, we booked last June,Edited: 9:19 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"In Italy, the only towns actually quarantined are not places where tourists go. They are a bunch of small towns outside of Milan, and another one further east towards Venice. The rest of Italy is not quarantined. A lot can happen in just a few weeks. It is quite possible that by your departure dates, this will all have settled down. If instead it gets worse, it is likely that airlines will offer rebooking opportunities without penalty. They are already doing so for some locations now.So keep a close eye on the situation, but don't panic. Here's hoping you will be able to enjoy your trip!"
"#5 thank you. NZ has banned travellers from china and now, Iran. Direct flights have been cancelled. For us, we could be stranded in the other side of the world with no way to get home."
"Sorry, when I looked again saw it was June when you booked but March when you travel."
"As you are citizens of New Zealand, in the event that your country imposed restrictions or quarantines for travelers coming from Italy, and since there are no direct flights from Italy to New Zealand, I would expect that your country would organize special flights to bring home its citizens, as other countries have already done for China. This would be an opportunity for the RNZAF to show its mettle!"
"Flights between NZ and Italy are frequent, as from Australia, mainly Singapore, Emirates, Qatar. Cathay now a problem. I can't imagine Oz or Nz governments thinking it necessary to evacuate people from Italy. People would be rushing away from the offer! I find it difficult to believe that nothing can be cancelled. We have Qatar bookings Sept-Nov Sydney-Italy return, fee for cancellation AUD300 each from 1300 each. Check at Manage my Booking at your airline. Similarly accommodation... ask.If you have an expensive tour on the Rhine etc, ask. Ask everywhere. In other threads here many people are asking and getting some refunds. If you have made bookings through a travel agent, sit in their office till they fix it.So far as being at the bottom of the world is concerned, the truth is out herehttps://www.flourish.org/upsidedownmap/"
"I don't know about other countries but the US Dept of State has already made clear people should not expect it to continue to charter planes to pluck people out of plague zones and should therefore think through their travel decisions carefully.Also, I don't know about insurance in other countries, but in the US I usually buy my insurance through insureytrip.com. For the past several weeks I have been getting friendly coronavirus updates from them I think every week.( They must be inundated with calls from people wanting to cancel trips). The thing they keep reiterating is that fear of traveling is not covered by trip insurance. Furthermore, today I received an email reminding me that since the virus became a named event on January 21, 2020 no insurance purchased after that date covers virus-related cancelations under trip cancelation provisions. So I assume even if the US warns against travel to a certain country, nothing for cancelation would be paid if insurance purchased after 1/21. However, insuremytrip likes to point out that medical, evacuation & trip interruption coverages would all continue. Check with insurers in your own country to see what rules apply there.Edited: 12:22 am, February 28, 2020 "
"At least in the US, most travel insurances buyers have no idea what's truly covered and what's not. And in most case's, most things aren't covered, giving buyers a false sense of coverage. Welcome to the insurance world. Not unlike people being told by credit card companies that they have car rental insurance coverage through their credit card when in fact few actually provide the complete coverage needed."
