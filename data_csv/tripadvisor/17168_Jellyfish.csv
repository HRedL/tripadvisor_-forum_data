Hi gang. I'm going to San An in October as planning on doing some snorkelling in some of the near by coves/beaches. I was wondering if jellyfish are a problem again this year as I went last year and got stung twice at calla bassa
yes and no - fair few about but not an epidemic like we've had once or twice before.....good luck and enjoy!b.
