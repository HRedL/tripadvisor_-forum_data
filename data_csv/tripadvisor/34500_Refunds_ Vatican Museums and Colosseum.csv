Hello. I bought tour tickets for the Vatican Museums and Colosseum directly on their sites for next week. My trip to Rome has been cancelled due to the Travel Advisory rising to level 3. I know the sites have a no refund policy but just want to know if anyone has ever had any luck getting a refund under these circumstances.

"Agreed. And, please come back and let us know how it went as, I am sure, other people are going to be asking the same question..."
If nothing else - the Vatican Museums will accept changes in date + time. I assume you don't have a new future date in mind for this trip but you may want to push the reservation into the future.
Very curious about this as well! Keep us posted. We are due to arrive March 15 and holding out a tiny bit of hope.
Claim for the tickets on your travel insurance. I can't see the venues refunding you.
"Email sent, if I don’t hear back I’ll try to file a claim with my credit card travel insurance."
But insurance usually does not cover pandemics.
It depends on the policy. I don't think a pandemic has been declared yet.
Laura - we will be there march 8 and we are still going.. we have not heard not travel to Rome so we are going and enjoying our time there with maybe less crowds..
"The U.K. FCO only advising not to travel to the 10 small villages in north of Italy which have been affected. Therefore, would not be covered by insurance."
schuetz0710 - you may get a truly amazing experience if the crowds are gone from the Sistine Chapel!
"Spanish StepsYou are right, I’d think this is the time to visit any major European city."
"I am in Washington DC now, headed back to Rome late April for a couple of weeks. Unless things get significantly worse, I'm going, I will just use common sense precautions. And if I get there to a crowd-free Rome, I will do everything I can to support the small businesses that are already feeling the pinch."
I've just heard back from the vatican. They are not offering refunds. They will gladly change the date and time of your ticket to any time within 2020 but no refunds will be offered.Donna
"If you are going to get coronavirus, you are are just as likely to get it in NYC, Sydney, Paris or Rome."
#9 - I totally agree! However my husband is now under an employer mandated quarantine if he goes with lots of stipulations. I’m not sure if he’s willing to risk it. It may be that my son and I still try the trip though!
I hate the thought that my Colosseum full experience tickets will go unused. Are they transferrable? I'd happily gift them to someone who can use them if they are.Same question with my Borghese tickets
The colosseum tickets should be transferable. I'm not sure about the Borghese tickets. Donna
I don't know where you live OP but what exactly is Travel Advisory Level 3 mean? Italy is not out of bounds generally except for some northern towns listed and Rome certainly isn't.
"""I hate the thought that my Colosseum full experience tickets will go unused. Are they transferrable? I'd happily gift them to someone who can use them if they are.""Unused, well, it may sound as an unlucky investment. If a virus may cause tragedy, economic paralysis may too. It was said that not travelling may be an ethical choice in this moment; well, one could regard as another ethical choice - sorry if I word it very directly - asking no refunds and setting one's heart elsewhere until new times. One could say ""I would have visited if just I could"". But guides and museums staffs (or hotel staffs) could say ""we would have worked for you if just we could""."
"biana, a level three is one of several levels of risk the CDC uses to inform the country of risk level on various issues. Right now the main issue is the coronavirus/covid 19.https:/…https:/…index.htmlthe second link will tell you what is involved with a level 3 alert.Donna"
Thankyou for that
Yeah iam also curious about the refund for Colosseum. They closed until April. Bought our tickets from the official site and e mailed them. Do you know how we should manage using the tickets on other dates in this year?
If tickets not refunded you should be able to claim on travel insurance.
"smyd d:>>our tickets from the official site and e mailed them. <<That is probably the worst thing you can do. I would guess that they have received thousands of emails and are absolutely inundated with messages. If they handle this situation like previous cancellations, they will automatically process a refund for you. Just periodically check the News section of the website for any updates or if any action is needed on your end. About a month's worth of tickets need to be cancelled and refunded so I wouldn't expect the process to be quick. I would give them a few weeks to start the process of refunding. If you don't hear anything by email or see a refund to your credit or debit card after about a month, that is when I would send an email."
"Thank you, that sounds reasonable! Great, hope they will handle it"
"The colosseum will be closed through April 3rd and the underground, arena floor and upper levels will be closed through the 12th of April. They should automatically be processing refunds for those who have purchased tickets or tours. Donna"
"The Vatican museums are closed as of today. They will issue refunds for all tickets/tours purchased or they will offer alternate dates.NOTICEVATICAN MUSEUMS CLOSED TO THE PUBLICDear visitors, having acknowledged the Decree of the Prime Minister of the Italian Republic of 8 March 2020 art.2 letter d), we would like to inform you that, for precautionary measures, from today the Vatican Museums will remain closed to the public. We regret any inconvenience caused and, in case of need, we invite you to write to the email address help.musei@scv.va for any request or assistance. Any further contact information is available on this website.Donna"
"Hi Donna,Have you seen any info ref refunds or is that based on prior experience?At the very bottom of the ticket small print it says non-refundable but I am assuming that is if the visitor cancels"
"In my opinion, the Vatican and the Colosseum will almost certainly issue refunds, or they will be facing hundreds (thousands?) of valid credit card chargebacks. They certainly won't want to deal with that.u know.If I get mine refunded, I'll let you knowEdited: 4:31 pm, March 09, 2020 "

"Thank you, of course, there is no rush on this."
"iExplore, all the sites have been closed by the government. They must refund you the money for tours/tickets. The colosseum process is usually automatic if there is an issue with tickets. For the Vatican museums they most likely will just do a charge back to your card.Donna"
Contact help.musei@scv.va for refunds for vatican museum. We received a confirmation that refund will be given due to corona-closing down the museum.
"NicoleCM78:There is no need to contact the support email address. Others have reported that they received an email from the Vatican Museums that they will receive a refund for the cancelled tour or entry ticket **without** ever contacting the support email. If you contact the support email address, you are likely slowing down the refund process for everyone."
There’s possibly nobody picking up the emails at the moment.
"Last night on MIBACT site it was an announcement with a lot of measures for covid 19 Misure extraordinare per tourism...I copy an extras in original languageProbably it will be for colosseum alsoVOUCHER PER BIGLIETTI CINEMA, TEATRI, MUSEI E CONCERTII rimborsi con voucher già previsti per viaggi e pacchetti turistici annullati a seguito dell’emergenza Covid-19 vengono estesi anche ai biglietti per spettacoli, cinema, teatri, musei e altri luoghi della cultura."
"I have confirmation yesterday that all tickets booked directly with the Vatican through April 30th will be refunded with in 60 days. Now fingers crossed on the Colosseum as that was the tour I booked incorrectly and would really like to get the $ back to book the correct one when God willing we will now be there in September instead of end of April.I will also note I was easily able to move my dates for the already booked and paid for Necropolis tour. The Vatican was not able to move dates only refund and then I will have to rebook.I must say all things considered right now, I was surprised to get such a fast response on both tickets."
"The Vatican only has to deal with their own tickets. Websites like Coopcultre deal with thousands of tickets per day from many locations across Italy. They have much more to deal with and are running with very little staff due to the restrictions because of the virus. Just be patient, they are working on a remedy, though it may take time.Donna"
HelloHas anyone have any info about colosseum refund or rebook ?Thank you!
Catinca E:It has only been 2 weeks since the government decree announcing the forced closure. While I understand that you want an expedient resolution to the matter....you need to realize that this is a very big undertaking. A month's worth of tickets is a very large chunk of change. The funds will need to be identified. A process will need to be set-up. Employees are required to stay at home from work. Also - CoopCulture administers other attractions in addition to the Colosseum.
Tickets for the colosseum & forum from “get your guide” were refunded as soon as the closures were announced. Tickets for the Vatican museums were booked through Maya tours who haven’t responded to an email I sent before we were due to visit. I followed their cancellation instructions. I’ve now requested a refund through my credit card.
"buongiorno500:Wow, that is remarkable. Usually GYG receives poor customer service reviews on this forum. I guess they were able to get things right for once."
"I appreciate that Italy is in dire straits. I received the email from get your guide as soon as the closures were announced, so it came out of the blue for me. I was somewhat surprised that I didn’t get the same from Maya tours. I thought they would have an automated email to everyone. I fully appreciate that they would have large volumes to deal with. It’s more the fact that I had no acknowledgement or automated response before Rome was totally closed down. I didn’t expect an immediate refund as you seem to think, just some sort of acknowledgement. I DO realise. I only posted this to make others aware of my experience, not for criticism"

"buongiorno500>>I didn’t expect an immediate refund as you seem to think, just some sort of acknowledgement.<<?????My only comment in Post 43 was that the majority of feedback about GYG involves poor customer service. However, it does make sense why they excelled in this particular case. GYG usually doesn't purchase tickets until the last minute - they hold your money and then buy tickets from the official website a day before your planned visit. They also have offices scattered throughout the world. If one office is closed, another one could step in and take care of the refund. So it would be easy for them to refund.However, your expectations in post 44 appear to be a bit unreasonable. It has been 2 weeks!!! The Italian government has told people to stay at home and not go to work. So your expectation is that they defy government orders and risk their health so that you can get your refund. Or rather that you receive an email about your refund. Nice.And - are you 100% certain that this other third party didn't email you? Have you been checking your junk / spam folders? Or did your email provider decide to completely block a message from reaching your account?Unfortunately, many email providers *block* emails from unfamiliar email accounts. The reason why you didn't receive an email might have been because of your email provider, not due to this tour company. Read the user agreement of your email provider and you will probably see this listed as a *benefit*. I have had trouble with one particular extremely popular email provider that *blocks* emails to my account. I know that the email was sent - a few times I sit and watch the sender hit the send button. I never receive the email in my account (not even the spam / junk folder) because the email provider *blocks* the email from my inbox. If I were in your position - 1) I would have waited until the country returned to a more normal state. 2) I would have tried to send a second email using a different email address.....one that might allow more unfamiliar email addresses to your inbox."
"I agree with Drew, the reason you received a refund from GYG is because they hadn't purchased anything for you. They are notorious for doing this and often times cancel at the last minute because they cannot secure tickets.As for the Vatican, aside from the remarks by Drew, which are all spot on, this is what happens when you use a third party vendor. People who booked directly with the Vatican have already begun receiving refunds. Donna"
Don't know if you have seen this - but Coopculture have posted a COVID19 HEALTH EMERGENCY: Ticket and service voucher refund note on their website. https://voucher.coopculture.it/Note that there is a deadline of 30th May 2020 for applications.
"For people who booked tickets directly with the following this is the information have received / been advised /read to date:1 .

@WestWickie when was your trip schedule for?
March 2020
You might want to email them to see about the refund. Most were done automatically. help.musei@scv.vaYou'll need to have all your reservation information available for the refund.Donna
