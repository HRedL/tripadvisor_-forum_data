Aruba has confirmed 2 new cases of COVID-19 from people who returned from Colombia two weeks ago. There MAY BE a POSSIBLE delay to the July 10 re-opening date for U.S. flights. A final decision will be made by Aruba's Prime Minister as we get closer to July 10.Those who have flights during that week should monitor their flight schedules on a regular basis.

"ArubaAmy- I am curious where you read that there may be a possible delay. According to Visit Aruba there is NO plan on making any changes:https:/…""Latest UpdatesJune 29, 2020 – Aruba has 2 new cases of COVID-19 – border reopening plans remain unchanged. After a long stretch without any new cases reported, during a press conference this morning, Aruba’s prime minister has said that unfortunately Aruba has two new cases of COVID-19. These cases were in quarantine for almost 2 weeks and developed symptoms over the weekend. Although the persons were in quarantine and should not have had much contact, contact tracing is under way for these cases. According to the Prime Minister, Aruba’s reopening plans remain unchanged, despite this development.

"Prime Minister press conference stated they would evaluate the situation regarding opening. As of right now, it is only a possibility but one people should be aware of if they have upcoming flights."

"We are supposed to leave on July 10th. We really need to know ASAP if we are to cancel Covid testing, flights, airport shuttle, and try to get $$ back on hotel. Not to mention rental car and restaurant reservations and pet sitters. This has been soo stressful.Edited: 2:26 pm, June 29, 2020 "

I hope they go ahead an open on July 10th- if not its just a matter of when they close back up not if. If 2 cases is enough to shut Aruba back down I honestly don't see why they would open up yet JMHO> Sadly it does not take much to make many sick....there was one bar in the US that now has 80 plus people sick.
Not true I live in Aruba and there is not such a news here by usWe hope people spread correct informations to the ones that will visit ArubaWe hope TripAdvisor are monitoring the situation also because they should have people who are checking into the news in ArubaFor now we don’t know where this information is coming from or is it a self made oneThis is what the Minister of tourism had to say about the reopeningThey have chosen Europe and Canada for the reopening so that they can have a better view and or grip how to handle the situation until July 10th when we have the American visitor will visit Aruba10th of July we have packed flights coming from the USBetween the 1st and the 10h of July we are going to know exactly what to do
"UPDATE 6/29/20 8:33pm:At tonight’s press conference the Aruba government did reiterate that they are continuing with plans to open the borders to the U.S. on July 10th and to Europe and Canada on July 1st. They stressed that it is very important that everyone stick to the guidelines that are being laid out, both locals and tourists. They are fully aware that when the borders open there will be more cases of the virus and they spoke about minimizing the risks. They stated that if all the rules and guidelines are followed, the risks are small. The hygiene and social distancing rules must be followed. The government does not want to take heavy measures again and urges everyone to do their part. They urge everyone to wash their hands, keep a healthy distance, and if you live with someone who is high risk wear a mask. Tourists should also wear masks during their flight, at the airport and during transportation to their hotel or accommodation. It was stressed that the plan of reopening the borders to the U.S. on July 10th has not changed. While they did say that they monitor the situation in the U.S. daily, most Aruba tourists come from the New York region where the cases are falling. They stated that there will be more cases and Covid is not leaving but all measures in place must be followed."
"As much as we are all very anxious to travel once again, I really don't think that all the added stress of trying so hard to plan a vacation at this time is worth it !! Covid 19 isn't going away anytime soon unfortunately......I for one am waiting until things settle down and will make my travel plans at that time. For me a vacation means relaxing and enjoying everything these beautiful places have to offer....and we are certainly not anywhere near that yet.....just my opinion."
I agree with you Cindy. Just too much uncertainty at this time.
"@Cindy and @Kat - certainly not for the feint of heart. With that in mind, I loath the thought of the mad rush that will be awaiting travel once a vaccination is widely available. I think I would rather take my chances with Covid then the droves of travelers that have been pent up for a year."

With spikes in the U.S I wouldn't try to reopen until like September at the earliest.
"Update posted on visitaruba.comVID-19) and Travel to ArubaIMPORTANT: New mandatory requirements for travel to Aruba (including rates for mandatory insurance announced on June 24)Latest UpdatesJuly 2, 2020 – Aruba’s active cases of COVID-19 increase to 3. Border reopening with USA being re-evaluated. The number of active positive COVID-19 coronavirus cases has increased to 3 today and the total to date is 104. The number of quarantined persons has increased to 2. 15 persons have been tested since yesterday – total persons tested to date is 2478. There have been 3 deaths confirmed in Aruba related to COVID-19. There are no inconclusive test results at this time.In a press conference yesterday evening, Aruba’s Prime Minister expressed that the possible timing and details of border reopening with the USA are being re-evaluated. The current target date is July 10, however especially considering developments in the USA and specifically the situation in certain states such as Florida – with Miami being a primary connection to Aruba – the Aruba government feels a re-evaluation is warranted. Different options are being evaluated, such as possibly restricting travel from US states with high infection rates or increasing stringency of requirements for those specific states."
"Glad to hear about the re-evaluation. Not sure that opening up to certain US states is a good idea. That would be difficult to monitor. We are watching the situation closely even though we aren’t booked until December , but at this point we would not be comfortable going if countries with high COVID cases are allowed. Things can change and hopefully the USA gets COVID under control. We also love travelling to the USA and will definitely miss it should things not head in the right direction.Edited: 4:07 pm, July 02, 2020 "
"I dont blame Aruba for giving some deep thought to allowing us (Florida residents) in. I am hopeful they will consider only allowing those who can submit a negative test before boarding entry. This will take some effort I am sure on the part of their airline partners, but if you cant test before boarding you shouldnt be on a flight any how, regardless of where you are going."
JT I would agree. If they want to keep Corona out having the test done BEFORE getting on the plane is a needed step IMO.
I agree that testing should be the responsibility of the departing airport. As stated prior if someone opts to be tested in Aruba and tests positive where does that leave the rest of us.
"There is no way Aruba can open up to all countries, not just the States and expect not to get some virus. I think if they gave a bit more leeway with the testing, people would be more than happy to take it at home and if positive, change their plans. As it stands now, alot of people will have to take the test in Aruba. The strict 72 hour requirement is not a guarantee that particular person is not carrying it but you will get alot less if they know they have it before boarding a plane. its sort of a catch 22 situation. but realistically, they can't open up and not expect some will get through."
"Aruba acknowledges that cases will increase once they begin to open.Realistically they know it will increase, they cannot continue to live in a bubble.Their strict 72 hr plan is both proactive and protective."
We are scheduled to leave mid Juky we have arranged for the rapid covid test which is a nasal swab test with results in 15 minutes. Would you know if that is acceptable for entry. Thanks
This site provides information as to what kind of testing is acceptable: https:/…procedures
"double check on the aruba.com page, they are pretty specific in what you need to do. they set it out in categories so you should be able to find your answer"
"NYCmom927, would you mind sharing where in NYC you can get the rapid test? I’ve been having a difficult time finding where to get results within 72 hours of departure."
Northwell Health has a quick turnaround time.
NYMom is that a PCR methodology and being done by an American (I assume) certified lab? I would ask Aruba gov't for a list if acceptable certified labs before being tested to make sure they will accept the results.
It has been confirmed that Aruba is opening to the US on 10 July however they have put an added restriction on people living in a number of States that they must upload a negative PCR test between 72 hours and 12 hours before departure otherwise they will not be allowed to travel. The option for people from these States to take a test on arrival in Aruba will not be possible. There is a list of 24 States where this applies.
Source ArubaScot?
"<< ""I would ask Aruba gov't for a list if acceptable certified labs..."" >>I rather doubt that Aruba will have a list of acceptable labs in the USEdited: 12:12 pm, July 04, 2020 "
@RJP - Look for my trip report. I will post live updates from the island starting upon arrival on the 18th.BON DIA
"If true it cannot be 72 hours. How can anyone ""gamble"" on getting results in time and not finding out until the day before if they have to cancel? Makes it impossible to plan a trip, especially when airlines and hotels need to be cancelled more than 24 hours out. I imagine this will cause a wave of cancellations if true unless they make it more reasonable."
"@Stryker - this is why you buy travel insurance. You should be testing before getting on an airplane, regardless of your destination. Not testing is same as spitting in someones face. If we had any sort of federal leadership in the USA this would have been mandated months ago, with sufficient resources set up for people to get rapid response testing before traveling. But we are lead by morons right now so we are on our own and have to take care of each other."
"Agree everyone should be testing. Unfortunately results just don't come back fast enough. For many the goal is likely to test and hope it comes back and if not test on arrival. They are mandating results be returned in 2 days or you will be unable to board, and unfortunately that's unrealistic with the state of testing right now."
I just started the Online ED Card process and when I entered our address (FL) it has a pop up message explaining due to us living in a state with a lot of idiots - jk on messaging but you get it - you will have to submit proof of negative covid testing before being allowed to board.I hope Spirit - dont laugh please Jet Blue cancelled the Fort Lauderdale route and American out of Miami was way out of line on pricing - has their stuff together to make sure they dont let anyone on the plane that doesnt have pre clearance
JohnnyTramm official letter from the Aruban Government to airline operators. It looks like they’ve updated their processes if you’ve been asked to submit a negative test on the ED process as Florida is one of the 24 States.
"ArubaScot, can you please share the list of 24 states? ThanksEdited: 1:24 pm, July 04, 2020 "
Visitaruba.com haas it under their coronavirus update
"dmlChicago the 24 States are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming."
"Aruba still intends to open borders with the USA on July 10. However US states with a high incidence of COVID-19 cases will only be allowed entry if they provide proof of a negative test result prior to traveling to Aruba and will not have the option of taking a test in Aruba. This will apply to residents of the following US States:Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming."
thank you!!!
"Hopefully NY stays off the list. Was going to do Hawaii but without a guarantee of 72 hour test results, I decided on Aruba with the option to test on arrival. Luckily I booked a direct flight on JetBlue. Was contemplating a MIA connection on AA. Fingers crossed I can still go at the end of the month."
"Unfortunately a negative test is not 100% accurate. The rate of false negatives is 20% or greater depending on the timing in the disease process. We have been told that not until day 5 of contracting the virus do you have a chance of a somewhat accurate test. Luckily, the rate of false positives is very low , less than 2%. So , if this is the new criteria for allowing residents from high risk countries to enter Aruba, I won’t take the chance. I really hope things turn around for USA as we vacation there regularly and will miss going at least a few times a year."
AFC Urgent Care. It’s a rapid covid 19 nasal swab test. However I’m not sure it’s acceptable. If Aruba claims they will have results in 6-8 hours they must also be using a rapid test and if flights are all booked coming in how will they handle all tests? It’s very confusing
"I think it is foolish to travel to Aruba without pre testing, regardless of where you are coming from. 1- why go through the trouble and risk of air travel without knowing if you will be cleared upon arrival only to be either isolated or sent right back2 - by potentially traveling with virus you are endangering your fellow travelersIf we had a competent federal government they would have mandated testing for anyone looking to fly, MONTHS AGO and had the support structures in place to handle large volumes of rapid testing with quick turn around on results. As is the case we are at the mercy of each others care, and by reading some of the posts here, sounds like a lot of selfishness on the part of people willing to travel not knowing their health status."
"If people would follow protocols, we wouldn't be in this position. And people are not selfish for travelling, they would love to take the test prior but it isn't possible so alot of people will take the test when they arrive. The Aruba government has tied alot of people's hands with their requirements. It seems to me the people who don't follow protocols are the selfish ones. Look at the states banned, why aren't those people following protocols."
"@carolim - you are missing my point. I live in a state (FL) with allot of idiots. Our elected officials have done very little to govern and slow the spread so it has been left up to individuals to care for each other. Many of us are trying, but it takes ALL OF US. Such as the case with air travel. Our elected officials have done little. Most of the airports, and airlines have put in their own rules to try and slow the spread, but individuals are still free to go about their way. If you are getting on an airplane, and do not know your health status you are endangering others, and by definition selfish. Pre testing would not be perfect, and without real rules and regulations, some will test positive, but get on the plane anyhow, but one would hope that some that test positive would sit out their flight for the sake of their fellow human. I for one am very happy Aruba is asking everyone on our planned flight to pre test and pre clear. So our flight from South Florida will have people who have tested negative in last 72 hours, passed temperature screening at airport, and will be wearing masks for the duration of the flight. That is about as low risk a flight as you can expect to get on these days. All flights should be that way if we want to get serious about slowing this thing down."
"Johnny, I do get your point. but if i am following protocols at home and not sick, no symptoms, doing everything by the book but can't take the test, get on the plane and wear a mask, wash my hands and take the test in Aruba, I don't think I am being selfish. I am doing exactly what I have to do. As a matter of fact, exactly what Aruba is requiring. But if you are lucky enough to be able to take the test ahead of time, good for you. some of us in the better states that have been flattening the curve and following the guidelines will take it in Aruba. I would love to take it here and upload the results but alas, it is not possible."
"And what happens if you test positive in Aruba Carolim? Have you not endangered every single person you have come in contact with in Aruba airport, on the plane, in your home airport? A few other posters have mentioned the risk involved in traveling, well, that is what is making it risky. This virus transmits through asymptomatic and symptomatic people alike. I hope you clear, but if you don't think about the damage you may be causing should you test positive after a long day of travel."
Only PCR is allowed. They stated no antigen (Rapid) or antibody (blood) testing allowed. This will hurt a lot of people...very difficult to get a PCR within 72 hours in a lot of states...
"Listen Johnny, just because you are in Fla and have to take the test, don't ruin everyone's vacation. I have followed all protocols, I will isolate at home even though I am doing that now. I go no where without a mask, wash my hands and carry purell. I will take the test home but if I don't get the results back, I will take it there. So please, don't go holier than thou with me like you the champion of the covid virus police. You act like I am on quest to destroy everyone in Aruba. If it wasn't acceptable, then why is Aruba allowing it. They aren't having a problem with it so why should you. And I know about the virus, my brother had it 3 months ago, he was positive, his wife was asymptomatic. I haven't seen them since before Christmas. So if someone gets the virus in Aruba, it is my fault? Do you take the test before you go to the supermarket, the post office, work, whatever. do you take the test on a weekly basis because you could take it today and next week get. So are you taking it on a weekly, or semi-weekly basis because you have to protect those around you at the supermarket. You are not the Covid police. Just worry about your own state, okay.Edited: 3:07 pm, July 06, 2020 "
"No need to attack people as post #47 has done.If you are doing what’s required then other’s opinions don’t matter.The rules have been laid out, if you follow them the Covid Cop comments aren’t necessary.You do you...."
Everyone is following the rules and procedures that have been given by the Aruba government. There is no need for personal attacks.
"Lets all calm down. These are crazy times, and its making all of us crazy, me included. I am not looking to ruin anyones vacation, or attack anyone personally. My plan for my family was to always test before departing to Aruba. That was before Aruba mandated it. There was no way we were going through the hassle of air travel without knowing if we would pass the test in Aruba, so we were going to test home first.In my opinion, and thats all it is, an opinion, it makes much more sense to test before you fly, regardless of where you are going., but especially if you are going to a place where entry is not certain and you will be tested before entry. I would say any vacation would be ruined should you land in Aruba and test positive. I am happy Aruba has instituted this rule for Florida flights and I by no means meant to upset anyone. I hope everyone stays covid free and passes through all protocols without issue.See you on the Island....hopefullyJT"
JT your last posting would not have gotten many up in arms...the ones calling people selfish for following the rules set out by Aruba were too much. No worries this whole Covid thing is just crazy!!!!!
Hope to see everyone there! Let's try to stay safe and healthy!
"Johnny, everyone would love to test prior to going and we plan on taking the test prior but on the off chance we don’t get the results back, we will have no choice. We go for 5 weeks,. If i have to quarantine for 24 hours, its not a big deal. We practically do it here. But i do intend to isolate at home before so I will know if i have symptoms. No one wants to go on vacation to be sick. And hopefully the requirements will be more realistic. If they would change from 72 to 96 hours pretty much everyone can take the test home. But anyone can take it home, get negative results and end up getting it or having symptoms show up when you get there. Nothing is perfect."
https:/…traveler-health-requirementsUpdates on states with additional requirements for entry. No other changes as of today.
"I think they should make the rule strictly MUST TEST BEFORE . Too many people will wait to get tested in Aruba. They could infect people on the flight. Also, is Aruba going to have enough capacities ty to test and send results for thousands of people a day? Lots of people are too ignorant and stupid and selfish to care about others...."
"@Paul - I second your thoughts, the biggest risk Aruba is taking is allowing people to land on the island without knowing their covid status. Mind you, even those of us that test negative 3 days prior are still a risk to the island, as we can be exposed at any point after testing, but it seems to be a lessor risk for sure. Hopefully everyone who gets tested on the island is adhering to the quarantine rules until they get their results. It only takes one yahoo to ruin it for everyone. Dicey."
"Hawaii did an interesting thing during their quarantine - they instructed the hotels to give a single use keycard so if anyone left the room, they would be forced to go to/call the front desk for access and thus be caught. It would make sense to do this in Aruba until the visitor’s quarantine period is over."
"Does anyone know where to get those Rapid Covid-19 tests- has anybody had one? Reportedly, you get the results in 15-30 minutes. We are planning a trip and the ""72 hour window"" is very hard to do if you go through your physician and then depends on the Laboratory turn around time. I know people in California have talked about ""point of care"" Rapid tests but not sure if they are available all states ?? If anyone has experience with this, please share."
