"Japan Travel is advertising two Japanese travel insurance companies on their website - Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Insurance and Tokio Marine and Nichido Fire Insurance. You can only buy this insurance once you are in Japan. Does this mean these two companies will cover coronavirus related illness? Has anyone used them and any ideas what the cost would be?I already have travel insurance for Japan with Southern Cross Insurance but when I checked their website today I saw this notification"" If you purchased your policy after Friday 31st January 2020 at 2.00pm (NZDT), there is no cover* for any event relating to the Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) because this is no longer an unexpected event.""I bought mine on 3 Feb so I am now casting around for some other options. I've emailed Southern Cross for a definitive answer."
You have to read their policy conditions or ask them yourself.
"You should ask Southern Cross Insurance about their policy. But, please also read the comment of hfot2 here.https:/…105816155"

Thank you this reply. I had read that post but since they seemed to be American companies I didnt think they would cover someone from New Zealand.
"Thank you for your reply.It's rather difficult to get an answer out of the two Japanese companies because the instant reponse you get is that you have to wait until you are in Japan.Japan Travel has placed a link to these two companies on their webpage which implies they will cover coronavirus. Otherwise, why bother? Most people get insurance before they leave home."
"I read on my insurance’s web site (USA) that they do not cover trip cancellations due to coronavirus (flight fare and etc), but they do cover medical expenses should you require treatment from coronavirus in Japan or wherever insured person is going."
"Send the insurance an email written with a formal request for an answer the question and copy the response back here for us to comment. Often the quick verbal response one expects can be different when put to them in writing as they time to research the answer and you have something in writing to back you up. Explain everything to them that you are from another country etc, instead of being rather vague here in you post leaving most of us here to guess what you have or not done or said."
Thank you for your reply. An email is probably a good idea. I have emailed Sompo Japan Nipponkoa with this simple question:Good afternoonCan you please tell me if your insurance policy covers any Covid-19 (coronavirus) related illness?Kind regardsMary HutchingIf I hear back from them I will post the answer here.
"Hello, I was wondering if you received a response from Sompo Japan?"
I was wondering if you had any luck getting an answer? I have also been trying to find out if Covid-19 related medical claims would be covered but have not found answers so far.
"Hi MoniqueYes I have just had a positive response from Cover More (see contact details below). They told me that they would cover medical costs arising from Coronavirus but would not cover disruptions to travel or other cancellations. I found that quite reassuring and it tells me that the company actuaries have calculated that the risk of disruption is greater than the risk of actually catching the virus. I got insurance cover for $NZ136.I hope this is helpful.Phone: 0800 500 225 Fax: (+64) 9 300 7370enquiries@covermore.co.nz covermore.co.nz Level 7, Tower 2, 205 Queen Street, Auckland, New ZealandPO Box 105-203, Auckland City, Auckland, 1143, New Zealand"
No not from them but I did get a positive response from CoverMore (a New Zealand company with head office in Zurich). See my reply to Monique.
Thank you so much for getting back to me! I am based in Australia but will need to get cover for my sister in New Zealand. Medical expenses are my biggest concern so that is very reassuring to hear. I will get in touch with them :)
