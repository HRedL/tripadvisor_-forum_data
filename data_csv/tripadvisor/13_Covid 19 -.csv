"I'm from Florida,planning on driving up to Detroit Michigan. Are there any issues as far as mandatory lockdown?"
Stay home. This is not a time to travel. Almost everything is closed.
Please stay home so the spread of COVID-19 stops. Detroit has a tsunami of COVID-19 cases.

"To actually answer the question, the entire state of Michigan is under an executive order from the governor that is basically ""shelter in place"" like many other states. This currently runs through April 13th. All non-essential businesses are closed. Casinos, museums, parks and just about everything else are closed. Restaurants are carry out only. About the only things open are grocery and hardware stores. https:/â€¦00.html"
"tev, actually many parks are open. It's about the only outlet for recreation left. Maintain social distancing, of course."
