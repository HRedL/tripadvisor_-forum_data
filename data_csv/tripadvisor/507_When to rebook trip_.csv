"Hey everyone, was scheduled to stay in Kihei 3/28 - 4/7, but will be postponing my trip. Was wondering what everyone's opinions are on the best time to reschedule... Based on when you think travel will return to normal, when Maui restaurants/parks/etc will return to normal, weather conditions, crowds, etc. My initial thought was to go over July 4th week, but not sure if that would be too hot, windy and crowded. A previous trip I took to Maui was in December '18 and the weather and crowds were both fantastic, however I don't want to wait that long to return! Only other consideration (for me personally) is that I have other travel plans 9/6 - 9/13 and 10/1 - 10/4. Thanks everyone!"
"Not a professional or local and have only been to Maui once. But in my opinion, I believe July will be a bit early to reschedule travel plans. Even just for your peace of mind, I would postpone til later in the year like October-December, and maybe wait a few weeks until you rebook. I’m currently trying to look at rebooking my wedding that was booked for mid May, so I know the struggle."
"Unfortunately, no one (not even scientists) knows how long we'll be dealing with COVID 19. Since the speculation seems to lean towards 6 months to a year or more, July 2021 might be a safe bet for booking travel."
"Yes, Susan is probably correct. I watched an interview with a medical expert on infectious disease and he was saying that until the vaccine is ready next year, we'll be dealing with this. I wouldn't rebook anything until you know we are in the clear. The airlines will probably be extending the ""reuse"" dates on all our tickets because of this nightmare."
"I asked the same thing the other day:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g28932…As recently as a week ago I wasn’t even set on canceling. Now I wouldn’t be comfortable rebooking before...oh, I don’t know. Winter at the earliest...?~ Colleen"
"We were looking at a trip over in October but will now wait until at least July to decide. In the meanwhile, I'm still getting my fix by enjoying all of the many webcams, both on Maui and via PTZ tv online that cover many of the cruise ship ports in the US and Caribbean..Social distancing is the new norm for awhile. Let's all just hope that those in charge can help get a handle on it sooner than later! We're all in this together..."
Clue: China had believed the nation was past the Covid-19 crisis -- after draconian shut-downs. Now that people are going back about their daily lives they are experiencing a rebound of Covid-19.
"@klr - in addition to webcams, check out Google Earth for 360s of your favorite Maui spots."
"A ""best case scenario"" reported on NBC or CBS this morning was that social distancing/self isolation practices minimize exposure to the virus long enough for a vaccine to be developed and deployed, likely 12 - 18 months from now. You don't want to know the ""worse case"" scenario. In another report (also on NBC or CBS) a virologist interviewed projected that, while new cases may slow some during the summer, they would increase again going into the fall, as happens with most other viruses.Later, I heard another report about the long term damage to the economy all of these short-term band-aids to prop it up will do. Already we're seeing small businesses shutter their doors, possibly to never reopen them And what good will a $1,000 check received next do six months down the road when we're still in the middle of this?Not a pretty picture folks?Edited: 1:30 pm, March 18, 2020 "
Woot! Thanks Jlyn!
"Very sobering, MGventures."
"<""Not a pretty picture folks?"">Not by a long shot - can you dig up a few more alarming opinions to help us maintain our pessimism?"
"I will be re-booking flights before March 31 not to lose the ""changes for free"" perk. Need to travel before Dec 31, 2020 or lose the flight credit. Would be nice to Experts have covered every possible option with their statements at this point, so one of them must be right."
"Olli, are you also with American Airlines? I'm in the same predicament. Do you know if we have to BOOK the travel by the end of the year or if we have to actually take the trip by then? I sure hope AA extends that date..."
"Carolyn......you really, really need to talk to AA. What they do or did for someone else is irrelevant to you.You need to deal with them. No one knows what they will tell *you*."
"I'm in the same situation with AA. I really hope they change their policy. We booked out airfare for this April, May 25th 2019. I called AA this morning and they said I can change the flights one time, but we need to TRAVEL by May 25th 2020. Ridiculous. I really had hoped we would be able to rebook and travel within a year of the original travel dates."
"Hawaiian told me that I can change flight for April 19-May 1, no fee, new travel by December 31, 2020. So..... we are looking at November, first 2 weeks. What if that time gets near and the virus issues are still a problem. ??"
"The thing is, we are learning more about this as time goes on. (picture your life a week, two weeks ago)The epidemiologists have warned from day one that this thing will mutate and come back during cold and flu season for round 2 this fall and really wipe people out with sickness. Remember, even after vaccinated, your body isn't at its full immunity until 2 weeks (flu shot)I think we'd be lucky to travel by spring of 2021"
"""Was wondering what everyone's opinions are on the best time to reschedule."" Why ask here? All you get are the same handful of naysayers who seem to want to one-up each other with their dire predictions. . Dr. Fauci as well as most all serious scientists have said that this situation is unprecedented. Just the day before yesterday, Dr Fauci declined to give a time frame till we will turn the corner on this. Don't get me wrong, I believe this is very serious and I'm doing what I can to avoid catching or spreading the virus, But I won't give you my opinion on how long because I don't know. Dave"
"That's why it's an opinion, Dave; we don't know. As I said, I asked a similar question myself, curious if others are rebooking ~ and if so, when ~ or canceling outright. Of course I don't take anyone's input as ""fact"", and would hope no one is taking mine in that context. I've said that at this point I'm canceling and waiting to rebook until things feel smoother. Just what feels comfortable for me, especially as one of my trips involves an Army son who has even less flexibility than the rest of us. My two cents as we banter, get a feel for others' thinking, stay connected, yada yada. : )~ Colleen"
"""When to rebook trip?""It's too early to consider.As for what dates to look at, it seems the majority of people are aiming at Oct - Dec. That would make those months extra crowded, assuming (a giant ""if"") things return to normal by then.""My initial thought was to go over July 4th week, but not sure if that would be too hot, windy and crowded""Yes, July would be very hot and crowded."
"<""Why ask here?"">Agree - someone needs a crystal ball to answer the question on when to rebook for, without stating a wild guess or quoting speculation that we've read or heard in the news.  I also agree with Colleen ... it just discussion - same thing we always do here on the forum:)"
"Ah, I think it makes us feel better to plan (dream). We have no control, true, but we do have hope."
"I was wondering if it is helpful somehow for us to be planning, making potential bookings?There was an article about a small business here in Canada, (Coles note version) who not only had bookings that have cancelled, but no phone calls, emails, or inquiries about any intention to come in the future. The business owner can’t have any hope.Are we giving some business owners hope when we at least try to see a light at the end of the tunnel?"
"Idream - I would only make bookings that I thought I'd be able to keep ... e.g. if I was optimistic that it will be OK to go when I book for, and the cancellation policy is good, then no harm in booking. It might give the owner some hope ... but there's also the chance that the business might not survive this crisis even with the hope of future business. I'm not booking any travel now ... will wait to book until I think it's safe to resume travelling again."
"""I think it makes us feel better to plan (dream). We have no control, true, but we do have hope.""That's it precisely. It's tough to have nothing on the calendar to look forward to. Heck, I'm not even sure if a summer road trip (or the marathon along the way) will happen. Contemplating when I might book a flight is a way to look ahead and hope.~ Colleen"

"Good point Susan. I made a booking for December. I am hopeful but we don’t have any true or solid info to base our thoughts on, that by December this may be over or under control. I actually feel we are headed into such unknown territory there may very well be long term effects we cannot anticipate right now. Just being realistic. I have booked with Costco Travel and feel good with their policies for cancellations."
"Sorry, been bit hectic and missed the question there. Our flights were with Air Canada. At this time they require travel before Dec 31, 2020. I need to be optimistic and hope for being able to travel this year. Many things will change between now and next week let alone months from now. With the uncertainty in the air, I would rather get my money back, but I don't think that Air Canada has cash to refund the flights."
