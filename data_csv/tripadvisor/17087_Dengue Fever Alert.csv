"Keep in mind that seasons in Rio de Janeiro are the reverse of those in the Northern Hemisphere, so “next summer” begins in December:Spring: 22nd September - 21st December Summer: 22nd December - 21st March Autumn: 22nd March - 21st June Winter: 22nd June - 21st SeptemberDengue Fever information:http://www.denguefeversymptoms.org/"

Thanks for the info.
"Rio’s Secretary of Health, Sérgio Côrtes, said Monday that the city faces a new dengue epidemic.http://bit.ly/pzdn2D"
No doubt it is a very important Forum topic and advertisement.Thanks for that!
"Thanks very much for this info. I'm obviously way behind the curve on visiting Rio, but am trying to catch up! The State Dept page linked in another thread was also useful: …state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1072.html"
On Thursday the mayor of Rio de Janeiro said a dengue fever epidemic looms over Rio this summer. He warned residents against a potential outbreak of dengue fever as summer approaches in the Southern Hemisphere.http://bit.ly/tatuci
Dengue fever is always a big problem in many parts of Rio but there is no epidemic in the tourist areas.
"When is the peak of the Dengue fever usually happening? I am tempted to do on the last week od December 2012. If it mainly Rio that is affected or other areas as well? I was thinking about Paratty, Pentanal and Ouro Pretto (first two weeks of Jan)Thanks"
"The peak of the dengue fever epidemic in Brazil can be anywhere between late December and early March.Although Rio’s dengue epidemics are not as insidious in the areas frequented by tourists, they are a serious matter because touristic Rio is surrounded by favelas, the main breeding grounds for the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which transmits dengue fever through its bite. If you’re thinking about the Pantanal, you have another reason to be concerned: piranhas:Thousands of flesh-eating piranhas have recently infested the Pantanal river beach popular with tourists, biting at least 15 unwary swimmers. One of the bathers lost the tip of a toe during a frenzied attack.http://bit.ly/syULJyHungry Piranhas Attack Tourists For The Second Time (Videos):http://bit.ly/rvZGvm"
Great. Now all I am missing is snake invasion in Paratty:)Thanks fot the info MonteCD. I'll factor that in as well. Maybe Cancun isn't that bad a choice after all...
Cancun? No way! Don’t give up on Rio (or Brazil).General recommendations to avoid mosquito bites:Apply insect repellent sparingly to exposed skin. Wear long-sleeved clothing and long pants if you are outdoors during the day and evening.Avoid highly populated residential areas (like favelas).Spend time on beaches.
"I was planning on going to carnival, should I cancel? Perhaps I should check with the cdc."
Ohhhhh my goodness..... don't worry about this crap when visiting Rio. I somehow managed to survive more than 5 years in Rio without catching Dengue (or being bitten by Piranhas). What is the point of this posting?Just take some Mosquito spray if you are worried....
"Dengue in Brazil dates back to the mid 1800's. How many foreign tourists visiting Rio have become infected with dengue in the last, let's say, 100 years?"
"So far this year (2011) there have been over 5,500 cases of dengue fever in Zona Sul—the South Zone, where most of the tourists stay—according to Rio’s Municipal Secretary of Health and Civil Defense, who is stepping up preventative campaigns to battle an epidemic in 2012. How many of those cases were tourists the secretary hasn’t said, but perhaps, Marcio, you can find out by contacting his office. It’s possible, also, that he may have figures dating back 100 years. In any event, please let us know what you find out."
"Most tourists stay in Leme, Copacabana, Ipanema and Leblon and so far this year there have been 1,913 reported cases in these areas. If you throw in Flamengo, Gloria and Catete that's another 526 cases. Santa Teresa had 747 cases but it's not really considered south side. These are official numbers: http://tinyurl.com/chsbtd2Notice that zero cases were reported in these areas in the last several weeks and that there has been a reduction of 24% in the number of cases if compared to last year. http://tinyurl.com/btod6fe My guess is that the number of foreign tourists infected with dengue in Rio in the last 100 years is close to zero. Please let me know what you find Monte."
"“My guess is that the number of foreign tourists infected with dengue in Rio in the last 100 years is close to zero.”You’re joking, right? See “Rio Braces for New Dengue Fever Epidemic”:“In September, government media reports indicated a total of 67,535 cases of dengue registered in the city of Rio de Janeiro this year [2011], with 43 deaths. April was the worst month with 24,000 cases. Mayor Eduardo Paes, declared a state of alert and ordered a preventive action plan to deal with the possible epidemic.”http://bit.ly/nLVJL4"
"No, I'm not joking. I've only found 2 cases. How many have you found?"
"I guess someone is overreacting here. Dengue has been here, as RioTours mentioned for more than two hundered years.24000 cases of dengue, you should really know where, and why.5500 cases in Zona Sul...Don't you think that for the most part these would have occurred in the Favela?What is known of the aedes aegipty is that it's a low flying mosquito that likes humid areas and does not migrate much. Focos of larves will mostly be found in Favelas and not near high rises.I have lived here for 15 years, in areas where Dengue is indeed a high risk, and never got sick."
"I personally know of several friends who contracted dengue fever after visiting Rio in 2008, but citing such anecdotal statistics is no real indication of the risk to tourists.Keep in mind that it can take up to two weeks for dengue symptoms to become evident, at which time most tourists have been long gone from the marvelous city and not part of any “official” total. I do believe that most, though clearly not all, of the cases in the Zona Sul have occurred in the nearby favelas, but it seems to me highly irresponsible for anyone to self-servingly dismiss the danger of dengue fever to the traveling public.Mayor Eduardo Paes and his health secretary are certainly not over-reacting when they advise tourists to stay in hotels or hostels that are air conditioned or well screened, and periodically sprayed with insecticide."
"Thanks Monte. I agree that it's somewhere between silly and irresponsible to insist that Dengue is mainly in the favelas when the same thing can be said about crime. The favelas are right next door to some of the major tourist areas anyway. Given that a Rio tour operator quotes thus: ""Most tourists stay in Leme, Copacabana, Ipanema and Leblon and so far this year there have been 1,913 reported cases in these areas"" I think the really smart thing to do is go in the wintertime! Rio is never that cold anyway and I don't really crave hot weather, unlike most people.Finally, it's worth noting that there are risks anywhere. In most major U.S. cities there are seriously life-threatening conditions if you simply go to the 'wrong' part of town. And bug spray won't help you ;)"
