"Hi, my family were on the train derailment a week our so ago. I wanted alert those people also on the train that my son had come down with dengue fever. As you knew we were exposed to mosquitos without repellant on the early hours when these mosquitos are at the worst. If any person comes down with headache, high fever, lethargy please go to the nearest hospital to have a blood test for dengue fever. My son is now admired and being monitored."
"Sorry, my son is now admitted and is being monitored."
Very sorry to hear this. I hope your son picks up very quickly.That must have been a terrifying experience.Our sons both became seriously ill when we were last in Thailand - and it is a frightening experience.Will be thinking of you and hope for a fast recovery.Caroline.Edited: 7 years ago 
"My best wishes too, I had Dengue some years ago and it was most unpleasant. I hope he gets well soon. There is currently an epidemic of Dengue in both Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai."
"Thanks so much, it's god to hear kind wishes."
Thank you. Just hoping the rest of the family avoid it. Certainly the hospital seems very good.Edited: 7 years ago 
Hope your son gets well quickly
I am so sorry to hear that your family were involved in such a tragic event. I hope you are all recovering from the train derailment. What a difficult experience this must have been for all of you. Thank you for coming on the forum and letting the rest of us know about your son's experience with Dengue fever. It will certainly be a reminder to all travelers to take precautions against Dengue. I am sorry your family found yourself in a situation where you couldn't take such precautions. What a scary experience for all of you.We will all be wishing your soon a speedy and full recovery.Broder
"So sorry your son's ill, hopefully he'll get well soon and thanks for the warning for others."
"Thank you for the kind message. He is now out of hospital and recovering well. We are finally enjoying Thailand, the delicious food, the wonderful people."
That is so good to hear. Is he ok - would you say fully recovered..?
No not fully recovered. He was very weak for a few days. He had a bit of a surge of energy so came out with us and walked a little bit but the next day he spent the morning in bed. I think it may take a bit of rest yet to be fully recovered but I have never had experience with dengue fever so not sure. They do say however that they recover fast.
"Leesabeta, thats great news. Hope you and your family have a great time during the remanded of your holiday."
