"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but in case there are any UK residents still out there in the Maldives, and not aware of the news, it has been announced all UK residents are to return home immediately as international flights are to be suspended. ...AG"
"Just a note to add that this information applies to all foreign countries, not just The Maldives and to all short term travellers and tourists. It's likely that more and more commercial flights will be suspended and that some airports may close, possibly without or at very short notice, making a return home even more difficult than it is at present."
"Just to add to thisI am led to believe that all flights through the UAE are being suspended as from Wed for 2 weeks, this includes Dubai"
