"Hi, any news if we arrive on the 22nd at Johannesburg airport for Mexican citizens and leaving on the 30th ? How is current situation ?"
"Current situation: https://m.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/corona…There's stuff on travel restrictions in the live updates section: 17 March around 19:00. No restrictions on Mexicans entering the country, to my knowledge.Edited: 10:19 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"See the links at the end of the article, especially the first one. https:/…Edited: 10:30 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"In short words, and in my personal opinion, you should skip this, and any other foreign country for the next few months. Not for your own personal safety but for the safety of those you will be visiting. If not going through a self-imposed quarantine of 14 days, you will never know if you will be one of the virus carrier that are spreading the virus among local population right now.Do the right thing: do not travel (for pleasure)."
"Thank you xelas. I for one appreciate how you have been giving this message. We (not unlike Mexico I imagine) will have a huge problem if/when this gets into our crowded, immunocompromised poorer communities."
"I forgot to mention that i make a stop first at Paris airport for 3 hours then i make a stop at Nairobi to reach JohannesburgEdited: 3:53 am, March 19, 2020 "
"Stay home until the COVID-19 vaccine is available, or, better yet, until the virus burns itself out ( it will, eventually)"
I’d be very surprised if your flights to Paris and from there to Nairobi aren’t cancelled.
I just got notice that the Lipizzaner shows are cancelled/postponed until the “crisis is over”. There aren’t any other restrictions set to take place? I would postpone any trips in case things get dicey at home or where you’re headed. And flights are getting cancelled everywhere. But most importantly for reasons stated above.
"“ I’d be very surprised if your flights to Paris and from there to Nairobi aren’t cancelled.”I agree, and even if they aren’t then with more and more airlines cancelling more and more flights getting back home again on the 30th will be even more challenging. I really don’t think it is worth taking the risk on international travel unless you really have to.I just bought forward my return flight from Cape Town back to the U.K. and, although I have a flight as long as it doesn’t get cancelled between now and Monday, the process of contacting (and in some cases failing to contact) insurance companies and airlines was an absolute nightmare - “We are experiencing high call volumes and you are in a queue. We expect to service your call in 233 minutes” (yes, that is real!). That was the overload in my travel insurance contact centre. I ended up changing my flights at my own expense without consulting my insurance company except via as-yet-unresponded-to email and will sort out trying to reclaim costs once I am back in the U.K."
"There are new restrictions coming all the time now. Most tourist attractions are closed. Public parks in Joburg are even closed. Restrictions on bars and restaurants starting. National Parks still open, at least for now. I would not attempt to come here at this time unfortunately."
"“ There aren’t any other restrictions set to take place?”I’m afraid so. All restaurants, bars etc serving alcohol now need to shut at 6:00pm Mon-Sat and 1:00pm Sun and, while open, they are not allowed to have more than 50 people in them at any one time.Also, all gatherings over 100 people are banned which affects many shows, events etc."
just stay home
"Julian SI decided to rebook at my own expense too, and try and sort out when I get gone but as I booked early the flights were still a good priceGood luck getting home. I know several people who are leaving on Monday I’ve encountered strict sanitation today at a winery and restaurant, we all kept a distance from each other, no hand shaking etc"
"Hi, they were NOT cancelled but South Africa was going to reject us :("
"South Africa needs to protect its citizens, so we will be in total ""lock down"" for 21 days from midnight local time on 26th March.Be safe"
