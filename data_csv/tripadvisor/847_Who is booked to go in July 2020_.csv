"Hi all,Is anyone booked to go in July 2020? We are booked to go on the 22nd July from the UK and we are considering trying to push it back to August to see how the new guidelines play out."
"If you can make your trip in July with all the entry requirements you'll more then likely not have many other tourist around which could be a good thing. Perhaps an upgrade at no cost.What Island or Islands are you visiting?Please, if you do go in July post about your stay and flight/entry experience.We depart in late Oct. rescheduled from May."
We are supposed to leave July 23rd if I can figure the testing out.....
"On Holiday, that’s a really good and welcome point! We’re booked to stay at the Hilton Moorea and then the Four Seasons. We were meant to have a week in California for a road trip but that’s obviously not going to happen. So, for this trip to go ahead I’ll need to change my ATN flight to depart from Paris instead of LA ( my flights to LA have already been cancelled thankfully so I’ll get that refunded) I’ve found a private clinic in London where you can get the same day results from the test so hopefully that part should be fine. I’m also considering getting the antibody test soon as an extra backup document as I’m a teacher and think I might have already been exposed to it back in March."
"I'm supposed to leave the U.S. (Virginia) July 31. I have an overnight layover in Honolulu before flying to Papeete on August 1. I THINK I may be able to swing the 72 hour, negative test requirement; I'm currently looking for clinics that provide the test and same day results. I already have travel insurance, and everything's been booked since December 2019. I hope it works out for me"
The antigen test is available with results in less than an hour. The PCR test takes about 2 days. As per the Tahiti Tourism website the PCR test is required. I communicated back and forth and they could not confirm that the antigen test would be accepted. They did say that more info would be available at the end of this week.
Is anyone else's flights keep changing? ATN has moved my flights by days 2 times now......I have to keep modifying other connecting flights and hotels......
cucakelovah: I doubt your Hawaii layover will happen. You have to be quarantined in a hotel at your expense for 2 weeks to arrive in Hawaii. You had better check the current entry to Hawaii rules or you may miss your HNL-PPT flight.
"Hi Susiesan1,I wasn't planning on leaving the airport though. I would spend the night in the closed off area that is available. If for some reason I couldn't do THAT, I read on their tourism site that you only had to do the 14 day quarantine if Hawaii was your final destination. For those like myself who would be in transit, I could just get my food at the airport, go to my hotel room and stay there until it was time to go back to the airport....."
"The second paragraph of the governor's statement is what I'm going off of. Duration of stay in Hawaii. 1 day in my room, no walking around on the beaches, etc. Which is fine because it's only serving as an overnight layover:The mandatory 14-day self-quarantine orders are: Proceed directly from the airport to your designated quarantine location, which is the location identified and affirmed by you on the mandatory State of Hawai'i Department of Agriculture Plants and Animals Declaration Form. Remain in your designated quarantine location for a period of 14 days or the duration of your stay in the State of Hawai'i, whichever is shorter.https://governor.hawaii.gov/newsroom/latest-news/governors-office-news-release-gov-ige-orders-mandatory-14-day-quarantine-for-all-individuals-arriving-or-returning-to-the-state-of-hawaiʻi/#:~:text=The mandatory 14-day,to seek medical care."
"cupcakelovah: curious why you booked such convoluted flights. Are you sure Hawaii will let you stay at the airport overnight? I seriously doubt it, that they will let you sleep somewhere on the floor. Most airports do not allow this.You may want to check on FlyerTalk if anyone else has tried to do an overnight stopover at HNL."
"Susiesan1,How is it convoluted? I fly from DC to LAX that morning on AA. I then fly from LAX to HNL on HA with a mandatory overnight stay, to continue my trip to PPT the next day. That's the flight route that was available from HA. If I can't stay overnight in the airport (which I have done before), then I'll just get a hotel room for the night. It's no big deal. I'm more concerned with the 72 hour test requirement than the actual flight plan itself...."
"The issue with state mandated quarantines is that its very vague.For example, here in Abq we have a 14 day quarantine but it says on the airport website that if you come here on business just continue on your normal trip but wear a mask. Like how strange is that. MANDATORY QUARANTINE...but not if you are here on business."
"Starting August 1st, Hawaii will forgo 14 day quarantine if you get tested negative for covid-19 within 72 hours, just like French Polynesia."
Is anyone worried that the US or FP may shut down while we are there in July? All this time I have been worried about the test and now with the latest news I'm freaking out about being stuck there or having to leave abruptly to get out. Not exactly the relaxing vacay I was dreaming of haha
"SMK, I was thinking that over the last couple of days too. I spoke to someone who lives there though and they said if they shut down again they’ll go bust because the shut down they already had has crippled them."
"SMK, what is the latest news??!"
Yesh... nothing new but in the US we have rising cases and more acceptance that it isnt getting better so I'm just being nervous about shut downs on either side. I'm think FP wouldn't so soon after reopening but I spent last night googling honeymooners stuck in remote spaces when this originally hit earlier in the year. Hahaha. I need sleep!
"As someone who was traveling in Spain when Trump banned Europeans from traveling to the US, getting home won’t be the problem. I’m more concerned my trip will be cancelled because the border will be closed again.Edited: 3:17 pm, July 04, 2020 "
"The UK is a long way home from Bora Bora. But like you both said, I don’t think they will close so soon after opening but I have been googling air b+bs just in case we’re stranded as I definitely can’t afford anymore nights in the FS!!!"
"I don't think they can afford to do another shutdown. If anything, they may wait a month and may do a country restriction, like the EU. But to be honest I don't really see that happening. F.P. doesn't receive the heavy traffic other islands do; they need an inflow of tourism to survive. Just my opinion, though."
"Agreed cupcake. They cannot afford a shutdownBy the way, just tossing this out there. The CDC reported Friday the death numbers are declining such that they are dipping below the threshhold of a pandemic. But the cases screams the media."
"They won't shut down this summer. Today I saw on a the news how the hotels are all getting ready to re-open and install social distancing measures. I know the Hilton in Moorea is reopening July 20 but some are re-opening in the upcoming days for local tourism until international flights open. They are all very excited but nervous, right now end of July is 70% fully booked but they are very scared people cancel last minute. The hospital have increase its bed capacity and they have received 10,000 covid testing. So unless the hospital capacity is overwhelmed with covid cases after the opening of the border which seems very unlikely given the requirement to fly there, and the tracing of new cases they will have in place.... FP is better prepared for the pandemic than few months ago which is also why they had to wait until July 15th rather than opening in June... they struggled to receive new test, ventilators etc but now everything is ready if needed."
