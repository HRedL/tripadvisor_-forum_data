"Hello, I'm traveling to the far east in November from Canada and I have a long layover (12 hrs) in Vienna. I was wondering if I can leave the airport in Vienna for 7 hours. I am a permanent resident in Canada but will be traveling with my U.S passport. If I present a medical certificate confirming a negative molecular-biological SARS-CoV-2 test will I be allowed entry in Vienna? Do they disallow anyone with the American passport or if you're residing in the U.S? Who can I email or call to find out?"
November is a long way off yet in coronavirus preventative treatment terms. You would be better off asking this question closer to the date of travel.Greg
As indicated nobody can tell you what the regulations will be in November. Check nearer the time.
"Hi there, I'd think the best way for you to find out about travel restrictions to Austria is to contact the US embassy in Canada nearer the time.In any case, 7 hours in Vienna will give you enough time to get an impression of the city. To see key state buildings, take either the Vienna Ringtram from Schwedenplatz (for tourists, with LED screens and audio info) or tramways 1 and 2 which each partly tour Ringstrasse. A whole round trip takes no more than 25-30 min. Back at Schwedenplatz, head for St. Stephen's Cathedral (Stephansdom) and then take a walk through the city center (Kärntner Strasse, Graben, Kohlmarkt). Fingers crossed we'll all (continue to) get Covid-19 under control."
"Well, I would not worry that much because you will most likely reach your destination as intended. If you are allowed to enter Austria, without any constraints, then you should definitely make use of it and go into Central Vienna, even though seven hours is not much. www.wien.infoBut if not, well then you need to stay in transit, and kill time until your flight to Asia is ready for boarding. Unfortunately, Vienna Airport is not as entertaining as other hubs. www.viennaairport.comEdited: 2:50 pm, August 03, 2020 "
You haven’t actually indicated what time of day your layover is. Obviously that can significantly affect what you do.
