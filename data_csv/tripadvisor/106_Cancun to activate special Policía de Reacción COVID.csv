"From Riviera Maya News on July 30, 2020Quote...The city of Cancun has created a special police unit to deal with non-compliance of Covid-19 health protocols.UnquoteIt will begin operaing on 3 August. Their job is to create awareness about prevention and to monitor the correct application of health protocols.In the instances of non-compliance, fines will be imposed by a judge and in the event that it is not paid, an arrest will be carried out for a maximum of 36 hours.Full report: https:/…2020.html"
My understanding is that they will places at various points throughout the city including the hotel zone. Cancun is serious about wearing masks. Yesterday I saw the police confront a group of tourists outside Wal-Mart who were not wearing masks. This is the second time this week I've seen that.
"Its amazes me that people are still fighting this. Even if you think its useless, this is a battle you can't win. Just put it on. WHY is this so hard?"
It doesn’t mention hotels. That’s unfortunate. It’s clear that resorts need “encouragement” to increase guest compliance in their indoor areas.

"""It doesn’t mention hotels. ""Once inside the resort, that particular resort determines if a mask is necessary. Some say yes, in the common area, and some say no. No uniformity in this."
"Excellent news they are extremely strict on this and mean it just like me! I am celebrating, Love to see that and each of us should help the authorities here to report anyone who thinks this is a joke. Mikey from Florida and a few guys like Copilot in the forum will stay at home and not be here or else? Well they know what will happen to them if they decide to play a hero."

"Specialized Covid-19 police hit Cancun streetsBy Riviera Maya News on August 4, 2020The Policía de Reacción COVID-19 will ensure that all citizens and visitors to the city abide by the current health protocols.https:/…2020.html"
"Thanks for the updates. We are heading to Iberostar Maya in a week. I had previously thought about renting a car, but I'm leaning against it because it doesn't seem like there are a lot of places to go to at the moment. I'm perfectly fine with just chilling out in a lounge chair and read a book."
"Day one of Cancun’s Covid police sees nearly 200 lacking in health protocolsBy Riviera Maya News on August 5, 2020Full report: https:/…2020.html"
"The article linked by Mr. B evidences why the Health Director of Benito Juarez is concerned that people still do not understand that these protocols are in place to curb the transmission of the disease. He explains that the hope is to achieve yellow status by December, not green, and if people do not start complying and following the rules, the northern part of the state could revert back to red.

"Cancun Covid Police make first arrest: Combi driver for overcrowdingBy Riviera Maya News on August 6, 2020https:/…2020.html"
"Personally, I'm thrilled by this news. CombI drivers have been disregarding the law for many years. They drive way to fast darting in and out of traffic with no regard for the safety of their passengers. There's st least one accident a day here causes by their excessive speed that involved injuries to passengers. They have blatantly disregarded the Covid protocols allowing far more than 8 people in the combi and people without facemadks. It thrills me they are finally being held accountable. They need to learn they are not exempt from the laws."
"Yes, it is good.An arrest was also made in Tulum a few days ago. An unmasked person was warned but still refused to wear a mask, so he was arrested."
Mister b and Joan!I’m thrilled too! How hard is it to comply to what all other countries are doing as well? We all wear mask. Joan we spoke about how hot they get and sometimes uncomfortable but being sock would be way more uncomfortable than following the rules set forth. I’m all about it when I’m in Tulum next week.
