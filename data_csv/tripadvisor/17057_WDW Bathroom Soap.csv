"All this talk of flu and hand washing reminded me.I had trouble with the soaps in the Disney World bathrooms last year.Frequent hand washing and drying with paper towel maybe?My hands became so dry and cracked, I ended up having to stop by first aid at the front of HS.They gave me some small packets of aquaphor.I’d never had this problem before.Wondered if this happened to others?"
"Yes, I found the soap to be more detergent and less creamy. Also they changed the shampoo and it no longer had the cute little mouse ears. Maybe, that was just the value resorts but I missed the soap that we had the first time that came in the orange wrapper."
"I am guilty of hoarding some of the delicious smelling room soaps & shampoos.I would tuck some away & mousekeeping would replenish them.I am probably single handedly the reason they now have the large locked dispensers in the renovated rooms at Pop.It was the soap in the park restrooms that got to my hands. It seemed stronger?? Never had this problem till last year, in all my years going.May need to carry a travel Aquaphor in my bag.It was painful. In the knuckle area of my hands. Cracked and bleeding. I know, tmi."
"Moderates have changed their soaps and shampoos, no more little Mickey ears"
I still have a bar of the orange blossom soap that I keep in my linen closet. When I reach in for towels it smells like Disney!
Just bring your own soap( we carry a small bottle of liquid soap) and don't forget the hand cream.
"Mojo, you should have been visiting WDW way back in the days years ago when they had that awful powdered soap which you dispensed then had to get wet to get any suds at all...if you got any which was rare. It was like washing your hands with grit and sand, and probably not very ""germ killing"" either.They've actually come a long way from where they once were with restroom soap at WDW parks.As for the resort rooms, I also bring my own soap from home for use there, but I have the luxury of driving to WDW, so I can bring as much as my Tahoe will hold.Edited: 2 years ago "
POFQ new refurbished rooms only have large pump dispensers now. This is one of the reasons we have decided to opt-out of daily housekeeping and receive the $10 per night compensation. You can ask for clean towels and have your bins emptied and we will leave our housekeepers a tip when we leave as they will still have to clean our room then.
"Ooh, I hate those large dispenser things they started using thos at Great Wolf Lodge in Niagara Falls and then you didn't have any shampoo for your last free day and the pool showers. When I go to Disney I want my swag! Yes, little hotel bottles are like party favours! I liked getting orange soap and mouse ear shampoo it was part of the experience."
"One of mojomo’s other posts had me smiling. Now I find she’s responsible for a crime wave in WDW. A serial hoarder. I’m shocked. Shocked. I always take my own soap, shower gel, bath oil etc and buy more during the course of my trip, as I find it’s not just the soap that dries my skin, but also the water. I wonder what products Minnie uses. I’ve never liked to ask."
"Was at sports last June and had the orange and blue packet soap. Not had any problems and I have sensitive skin. I regularly moisturise my hands with aveeno after washing and during the day , maybe you could try something similar and see if it helps. I think you may be right about the paper towels, I worked in a hospital for 8 years and the constant wash and dry with paper towels my hands were a mess . Bit extreme but could you take a small hand towel with you to the parks , seems silly but you use your hands for everything so no point in putting up with it if you can prevent or ease it . And your hands will be silky soft for eating that dole whip !"
Susan is this a recent thing or has it been there all along and I have not realised ! And is it the whole period of your stay you have to give up for example you couldn’t have a visit halfway through your stay etc ? How do you get clean towel ? I’m intrigued !
Charlotte we were at POFQ last February and got daily Mickey ear products (some of which might have found their way back to Glasgow lol). I have just seen the newly refurbished rooms which now have the dispensers. It looks like the good stuff they always use but larger and wall mounted. I don't really mind and would rather have $10 extra each day:):)You can get clean towels and they will come and empty your bins at your request but its all or nothing so if you opt out its for whole stay.Just myself and hubby in November for 10 nights and we are not messy so I think we will manage and will get a gift card for $90:):)Edited: 2 years ago 
"Yes I am the exact same , not a messy family and the magic a baby wipe can do will never stop amazing me . I can vouch that Edinburgh also has a small stash of the good stuff, I’m not a “shoppy,gifty” person so I have no shame handing over a bar of soap on my return as a present . That’s good to know for next visit I will definitely be opting out . Thank you :)"
Mojomo keep them safe they might be worth a fortune on eBay in years to come ;-)
"They did make nice “gifts” for those who stayed behind.So not sure why I still have some, LOL.Will def opt out of mousekeeping. Can use the $$ toward a Pandora charm."
Mojomo that's exactly what I was thinking. Not sure what my hubby will think but then I will be the housekeeper during our holiday so deserve the booty lolEdited: 2 years ago 
People were happy and amused when we brought back our eensy weensy cutesy soaps back for them. When you are not bringing back things for little kids adults got a kick out ot them.
"The soaps in the Bathrooms are horrible. I am carrying my own little bottle of soap now. I have gotten sick just about every time we go to WDW with a cold or Flu. Even after Flu Shots and not even in Flu or cold season. All those travelers, getting off Airplanes that are teeming with germs. And I am convinced it is the AIR in the Bathrooms. I wash my hands, I use hand sanitizer and I never touch my face, eyes, ears or mouth while I am there. So the only way, I believe I am getting sick is the AIR in the Bathrooms. When you enter those enclosed spaces, it is just as bad or worse than going on an Airplane. There is no CLEAN AIR in those enclosed, germ infested rooms. When You walk in the Smell is horrible from people's body fluids. I don't know what to do other than wear a mask when I enter those horrible WDW bathrooms. My Dr has instructed me to take Zinc 3 days before and 1 day after going to WDW and I have upped my vitamins to include Vitamin C, B6 & A. If this continues with these other precautions, We will just have to give up our Annual Passes and stop going."
"Well 3 of us got ill back in 2013 and from what we heard lots of others did too (stayed at french quarter). Sometimes there are bugs going around, doesn't matter where you are, they are everywhere lol, in the plane, the hotel, the parks, think of all the people touching everything you've touched constantly throughout the day :)"
"I came down with strep one year just a couple of days after visiting WDW, and I'm convinced I got it there. However, I'm not blaming the bathrooms as I could have picked it up anywhere."
"O.K., back to the soap topic.Many of the WDW resorts are all being changed out from the ""portable"" small soaps bars and toiletries to the shower dispensers as renovations are taking place."
And it’s 7 months old!!!!Talk about flogging a dead horse
