We were in Key West last weekend and it was wonderful and a respite from the coronavirus panic. Despite the fact that we have less than 300 cases in my state (Illinois) things are getting crazier and there are rumors that the Governor will issue a shelter in place for the state. If I have to stay quarantined I would much prefer to do it in Key West than here in Chicago. I know that restaurants and bars are closed except for carry out and that I can live with but I'm wondering if hotels are still operating and are their pools and hotel beaches open and are the shops open? . Key West depends on tourism $$ and I am happy to share mine but dont want to come if everything is shut down and the residents are looking at me with contempt for brining my midwest germs. I appreciate all info and responses but please dont be too mean to me for asking these questions and sharing my views!
"Yes, please stay home."
If you read some of the other posts here the general feeling from actual locals is get out and stay home.
We faced the same decision because Ohio is pretty much on lockdown. Some things are more important than our KW vacation - a very short list - but it was an easy decision to make. It would be selfish and short-sighted to think this wasn't one of of those things.
"We have very limited hospital facilities and emergency care capability, so yes, please stay home. We are also the end of the road for supplies so if there are shortages,we don’t need visitors competing for limited supplies. Some hotels are considering closing. I know Orchid Key has and I’m sure other will follow suit. While our Governor has been slower to act than I would have liked, as the cases rise, he will likely take the same dramatic actions as your State.By the way, I grew up in Morton Grove. I hope you stay safe."
"I just got back from traveling, and everything has exploded in general. Just one week made a drastic difference in basic necessities available in a fairly large city like OKC. I wouldn’t make the same decision now to travel. Think what next week may bring. And like it was mentioned, they are the end of the line."
YES stay home. We are regular visitors to KW and could move down there right now but won't because it is unfair to put the residents at risk. Even if opened you solve nothing if you use a common pool. This might hurt KW even worse than Irma did. It might be months before under control. Just because of zero cases now does not mean it has none. Let KW first handle it's own. Might prove to be none but not betting on it after the spring breaker stupid kids. What did they leave and what did they take home ?
"Yes, please do."
"Rebook! We were supposed to go in early April for Spring Break - we are now going in October. Not worth risking the spread. And it will be so much more fun once the virus is over. Why go on vacation to sit in a hotel room and stress over eating, etc?"

Latest rumor is that all hotels will close at 6pm this Sunday.
Not a rumor https:/…article241349851.html
yes please stay home
Hotels are closing stay home. Listen to what officials and locals of Key West are saying
"Even if the hotels weren't closing, this is not the time to be traveling. We have the trip I've been dreaming about for years booked for next month - a week in Maui followed by a 10 night cruise from Honolulu to Vancouver. While the cruise line hasn't officially cancelled yet, we won't be going either way. It will be better for us monetarily If they cancel, but if they don't - we will. It's the socially responsible thing to do."
"Are you serious???? I cannot even.......... stay at home, at by that I mean stay AT HOME. I'm going to quite commenting right now b/c I cannot believe this question is even being asked."
Stay home and count your blessings. Shouldn't be too much to ask. No one is sending you to war. Good grief. What have we become.
15 said it perfect
"I'm sure the message has come through loud and clear from the previous responses. I just wanted to type this response because the whole thing has me depressed it makes me feel better to talk about it.My wife and I have been coming down there for a long time, and religiously every year since we moved from Miami in 97. It is a trip that we take once or twice a year, and there are times that I would say it keeps us going. It is a home away from home for us, and we hope to make it a home someday. We love it like no other place in this world. We were planning to be there April 4-10, and of course will not be making the trip. I'm profoundly sad about it, but it is absolutely crushing my wife. But we are not even thinking of coming BECAUSE we love it so much. Just lamenting the state of the world we live in, and KW has always been the best place to escape the world we live in. All we can do is wish that someone had seen the wisdom in starting to test our population in January like so many countries did. Alas, here we are. All we can do is hope that all stay healthy, and maybe we'll be able to make a trek down there in the fall. And when we do, we will be tipping bartenders, waitstaff, and musicians generously. Cheers."
Sorry your wife is depressed. Good thing she escaped the polio epidemic that ravished our country.I'm ashamed I'm even commenting.
"I meant, sorry you are depressed and your wife is crushed. Condolences."
"My question was asked before the entire country basically went on lockdown . Many small business owners & their employees will be devastated by the economic consequences of this & may never recover. No income = lack of access to healthcare, increased mental health issues, homelessness, .... My question was not meant to inflame or harm anyone & was simply seeking a polite response to my question about bringing revenue to key west at a time when it is needed. Instead I was met mostly with snarky vitriolic responses. Perhaps instead of attacking maybe we should all try to be kinder.Edited: 8:44 am, March 22, 2020 "
"Are things more important to people than income, it is called staying alive. The warning was given before your post. Come 6 PM the message will be very clear and the KWPD will have hands full with those that do not leave."
"Jbk, I saw very few snarky comments here. At the time you asked, the country was already beginning lock down and travelers were advised to stay home. At that time, kw was being overrun by spring breakers and we still had no tests. I think the responses were appropriate. If you can believe it, the snowbirds are still coming down to their winter homes because they think it is safer. It is not! Our shelves are bare and are hospitals are not prepared. As of yesterday, Higgs beach was open and crowded. I think key west is way behind the curve. Be glad you were advised not to come."
You should be ashamed. Now is not the time to be nasty. We are simply asking questions & expressing our thoughts. Key West relies on tourism $$ to support its economy which will be in dire straits when this passes. Alienating people is not a good look.
"That was nasty? I’m sorry you took it that way. I thought I was being realistic. I’m not worried, tourism will always return. I’m more worried about my fellow islanders staying alive than your vacation. I have nothing to be ashamed of, perhaps you should reread your original post. The selfishness was obvious to me.Edited: 10:27 am, March 22, 2020 "
"jbk - who are you calling nasty? I am missing something. If it was Valentine, I seriously think you misread."
"Thanks blue, I don’t think the OP saw the “ our shelves were already bare and our hospitals unprepared”"
"I agree not sure where you saw people being nasty. We were all being honest. Sorry if you took it that way but I agree with the locals on here, they need to keep their resources for themselves. We all need to do our part and stay put. The longer we keep disregarding what our leaders and experts are saying the longer this is going to go on."
"I think jbk999 was calling my response nasty.That's ok.I think they don't realize people are dying. They care more about their vacation. Key west is so special. Should be protected for the residents that live there.People treat it like Disney World. They should be ashamed. When I visit, I treat it with respect and acknowledge it's home to the people who live there."
Not sure what people in all locations around the country and the world for that matter are not getting...STAY PUT. Going on vacation or to your happy place is just stupid. Every time someone travels uneccessarily it is putting lives at risk. Do I need to type slower for some of you? Seriously
They need to understand that if the locals die then KW will never get KW back up to running again. So if you want to return to KW then we must save the locals. Nothing nasty about this. The OP asked a question and didn't like the answer.
"Agree 100% with harboringviews comment. Some folks just don’t get that people are dying.Before Monroe County ordered tourists to leave, Publix Key Largo a vacationer was saying how this was her worst vacation ever - how the grocery here was out of everything - how lines were unacceptably long - how inconvenient that restaurants were pick-up only - how she would never return to the Keys. This said as her shopping cart was piled high to take supplies back to where ever she was from."
