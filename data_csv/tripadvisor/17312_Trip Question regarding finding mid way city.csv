"Hi. I am flying into Dublin arriving at 11AM. I would like to go to Galway for three nights before going back to Dublin for 5.Because it is an overnight flight and we will be on limited sleep, I am thinking I would like to stop in a city between Dublin and Galway to rest overnight. Which city would you recommend? I like small towns, farms, green space and donâ€™t need anything fancy. With that said, since it is one of our precious nights, I would like a town that I can walk around, find dinner, and a nice local pub.  Can you please recommend a city for me to look into that is about half the way? A charming one would be great! Thanks."
"When are you coming to Ireland? Surely not any time soon because of the coronavirus epidemic...In the meantime you could have a look at Athlone as an overnight option.And yes, Mullingar would be a good choice, too.Edited: 3:31 pm, April 01, 2020 "
I am coming in August. Thanks. I'll take a look at Mullingar! Any other recommendations also welcome.
Will you hire a car or are you on the bus?
"I would just get the coach from the airport straight to Galway, don't waste a day in the middle doing nothing."
I'd probably go direct myself; it's only about 2 hours from Dublin.You could get the coach from the airport and pick up your hire car whenever you need it in Galway so you're saving on costs there too.
I think it would be a pity to miss out on staying in a midlands town like Mullingar (which has really come on over the years and is well worth a visit). And Belvedere House (www.belvedere-house.ie/) would be a lovely stop on the way to Galway the next day.
"I found Mullingar abit of a sprawl as its now a commuter town for people working in dublin it has had a massive population increase in the past 15 years some of it was planned well by the council, other parts were not. If you drive and decide to stop there lough ennel is a 15 minute drive its very pretty with a lakeside family campsite with cafe and small shop. The lake offers nice walks,water sports which can be peaceful. Athlone i would skip though as its full of traffic.Personally though galway to dublin takes 2 hours stopping off for me would waste time either side, but each to their own."
