"I am wondering if anyone who has been to Vietnam recently has experienced any problems leaving the airport due to the H1N1 virus. My friend""s-mother's-nail lady said (just like Ferris Bueller, I know) that people are being charged $200. and not being allowed out of the airport for 24 hours to prove they do not have the virus, and then they are being charged and additional x amount of dollars to get out. I do not believe this to be true, but I am hoping to reassure my friend. Thanks! "
"Hi, We were in Vietnam 2 months ago and all was fine even sometimes we were informed of the epidemic, but definitely not like what you've heard about.Scott "
"I came back 11 days ago and no problem. In fact its on arrival they check you, not departure. They were calling people over who were showing up hot on the display but I didn't have an problems. And on departure, no checks at all. Probably more gossip than fact....until I'm told otherwise"
"Hi,To prevent the spread of H1N1, Vietnam is fully prepared to deal with any suspected swine flu. If someone is realized with any suspect, he will be detained and isolated until having results of tests. However, It is no charge !!! If you feel well, why not you come to Vietnam? "
No I don't think that is true.Maybe she was getting mixed up with america!

"JCOSF - There is a huge underlying mistrust between the Viet Kieu (Vietnamese living abroad) and the current Communist backed socialist regime, so crazy stories abound. You can only imagine why. Anyway, what you heard through the grapevine would be a great scam and I am glad to hear the reports are down to only $200 - they were up to $5,000 a few months back. But, all of these reports are yet to be substantiated.Middle of September, I had to fill out a 'pink' form that asked health related questions and gave that to a health 'officer' before going to passport control. They were set up to do body temperature scanning, but nobody was being scanned, and come to think of it the health 'officer' wasn't even wearing a mask.Funny story on the mis-trust. A Viet Kieu that I know had gone home with a pre-authorization letter for a visa on arrival (he is a US citizen now). His air ticket agent got him the pre-authorization letter but failed to notify him that he would have to pay $25 at the airport to get the actual visa. The guy told me he fought with the immigration officers in Sai Gon for 30 minutes because they were trying to 'shake him down' for extra money. He kept getting more upset because he had tried to give them $10, but they said it wasn't enough. The guy thought I was a genius when I knew they didn't give him the visa until he had given them $25 - the legitimate fee for obtaining a visa on arrival. He had been bad mouthing the current establishment for 3 months before I set him straight. Granted, there are scams, but they are becoming fewer and further between, and the H1N1 airport detention isn't one of them.Have a great trip!"
"They only target ""Viet Kieu"" people (people who are vietnamese or speak vietnamese). They dont touch Caucasians. So if you are one, no worries. But if you speak vietnamese, they take your temperature, detain you for 4-6hours and make you pay up a hefy ""discharge fee"". The key is to only speak English and make no attempt to speak Vietnamese."
