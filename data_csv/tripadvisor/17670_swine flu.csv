"We are heading there next Tuesday. We hear nothing but bad news in Wisconsin about the flu, nothing lately about Mexico...what is happening there?"
It sees like all the news here in Seattle reports is record numbers of Swine Flu and regular Flu cases. Lol. I've heard NOTHING about Mexico. Just about Hurricane Rick.... More of an excuse to get out of Seattle and go to PV ;)
We got back from P.V. Oct 14. The ONLY sign of flu was the lack of tourists. The local business owners had said it is the slowest they had seen it in 40 years. Had a great time and planning a trip back in May.There was some storm activity off of California that was creating large waves that some of the locals ( I think) were having fun surfing in.
"Generally the swine flu in Mexico is at much, much lower levels than that in Canada, the U.S. and U.K. You must remember that Mexico took extreme measures when it broke out and that did a lot to stop it reaching epidemic proportions."
"And Mexico continues the preventative actions, much more than I found when I was in Vegas in September. Here, almost every larger store, movie theater and public venues, including many restraurants have hand santizers when you walk in and advise everyone to use them. The schools have been teaching kids of all ages how to properly wash their hands and more often...as well how to cough properly, not in the hands but at the elbow.Where I work, we have to use hand santizer when we walk in and get our temperature taken. If we have a fever, we are sent home.There are public announcements on the radio about how to keep it from spreading and preventative actions. I haven't met anyone here that had/has it but I know many up north that did or does."
5 of us just returned from PV - absolutley no problems - I would agree with earlier posts - tourism is way down and they appear to be taking more serious precautions than anywhere I've seen the Seattle/Tacoma area. There is hand sanitizer everywhere - enjoy your trip
"Swine flu is everywhere now and sure seems like colds etc. have started early here this year so I don't think any of the winter illnesses are avoidable right here in the US. No reason to avoid Mexico, in fact we're probably bestowing all of our stuff on them now."
"At the risk of sounding dumb - can you tell me if anyone is taking extra precautions on the planes, etc. - for instance, masks on planes, etc? I think that the whole swine flu is a bit blown out of proportion, but my daughter has asthma, so I am trying to take things seriously for her. Any thoughts would be appreciated."
When I travel on a plane I now use Carmex on my lips and in my nostrils. (I got this advise on this forum). I suck on a cold ease tablet when I first get on the plane. I also wipe down the arm rests and tray with sanitizing wipes. I have been doing this since we went to PV the first week of May at the height of the swine flu in Mexico. So far no flu or colds.
"Found this on another forum: ""According to the US Consulate General in Guadalajara, as of October 9, 2009, the Jalisco Secretary of Health has reported 1,955 confirmed cases of H1N1 with 24 deaths in Jalisco and 36,593 confirmed cases of and 248 deaths in all of Mexico. To keep this in perspective, according to the CDC inAtlanta, the number of hospitalizations in the US is 30,027 and the number of deaths is 2,827. People might be safer coming to Mexico."""
sag---what is carmex
"The Carmex I get is in a small tube often used for chapped lips but I've used it for burns, insect bites and now by reading on here, good for flying. I will try it for that also. You can find it in Rite Aid, CVS or drug store, it's the best!"
I buy Carmex and Cold Ease at Walgreens. It can't hurt. I know from years of experience that Cold Ease stops a cold if you take it when you think you might be getting a cold.
sag---if carmex is for chapped lips what benefit is it to use on lips and in nose---why do you use it like that? thx
When you are in a dry environment (like a plane) the nose mucus dries up and can't protect you as well from bacteria and viruses. I always carry a small tube of nasal gel (seclaris) in my carry on bag.
I was wondering what the Carmex in the nose was about too! I've never heard that... Interesting. Sounds reasonable that at least it would keep your nose moist and work much like vicks... Didn't know that nose mucus protects you from bacteria... You learn something new everyday!
H1N1 is world wide. It does not matter where you are. If you are going to get it you will. Its the flu. Im washing my hands a lot more & keeping my fingers crossed . As soon as Canada says its OK for us over 16/under 65 people to get our shot then im in there like a dirty shirt. Risks yes. But i just got in an almost head on crash today. Almost. now driving a nice rental. Yes. He was charged. Im lucky. I would hate for my wife to be receiving that news while in China on business.  Wash your hands my friends. LIG ITS.
ok---i get it---thx you guys
"Haangin, Thanks for the tip. I've been ""addicted"" to Carmex for years, but didn't know about using it on the nose on planes. It's much milder than good old Vicks Vapo-Rub. (A little glass jar of Carmex is always on my nightstand.)"
We canceled our May PVR trip as a precaution. Turned out WI had more cases than PVR. In Dec we are going... we need to get out of here and.get loaded up on some UVB induced vitamin D. :)
"I visited my doctor to see what preventive measure we could do prior to leaving , as I was worried we might pick up on the plane and come down ill while in Puerto Vallarta. He gave me a box of the Tamiflu and advise me to start taking it if I felt any sypmtoms. It is provided free from the Government.see if you can get some, it comforting to know that I have it on hand.I also got me a bottle of Amoxicillian for anything else. Better to be safe than sorry."
"My doctor said have a good trip, see you in December!!"
"I'm not worried about getting any kinda flu in Mexico, it's being in damn NY & NJ that I'm worried about. This people sneeze and cough all over you all day long and don't give a hoot about hygene. At least people in MX are following how to prevent spreading germs, these people here blow their noses and then continue working...WITHOUT WASHING their hands, ewww!"
