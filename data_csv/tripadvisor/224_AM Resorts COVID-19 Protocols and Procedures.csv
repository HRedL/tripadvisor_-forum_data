Thanks Cat!
Similar to what we have seen from other groups. Still showing same opening dates as previously. Likely to change obviously.
"Thanks Cat S. I knew they would have a safe, but unobtrusive approach. For me. the key is prevention when the guest enters. Similiar temp checks and questioning measures were taken during H1N1. They were completed at CUN airport. Imagine how reassuring to have it done at airport and resort."
who in their right mind would go now ...?
"I guess it boils down to personal tolerance. If you give yourself a Covid Test before you leave home, and/or some type of Health Passport is in place, AND you have taken your temp before you leave, I don't see a problem. I didn't feel it was problematic traveling during H1N1 either. I fear asymptomatic guests the most. I am willing to accept prevention and social distancing(keeping in mind groups are allowed to be kept together) before wearing a mask and gloves on the resort. I am not willing to have staff with a clicker counter to have limits on number of guests in a pool. I have to social distance to pick up medication. It is the new normal."
A group of us are going this Nov and I’m happy omg to see AMR Covid precautions they are putting in place
"Note that should they re-open in August or sooner, those rules may have changed by then."
What kind of Covid test can you give yourself before you leave home? Tests have to be sent to a laboratory as far as I know & take several days to come back. It could come back negative but you could have caught the virus whilst waiting for the results. .Checking temperatures at the airport will be ok but what if you have paid thousands for your holiday & aren’t allowed to travel & even worse you have a high temperature at a foreign airport & aren’t allowed on the aircraft. Can you afford to pay for another two weeks at the resort & possibly take two weeks unpaid leave as well? Depending which country you live in you may also have to take another two weeks unpaid leave to quarantine yourself when you get back home. I love my holidays but travelling this year is just too much of a risk imo.
"Each will have a different tolerance to risk and measures in order to travel or not. It is a personal choice. Most will likely wait until things are ""safer"", some may decide to travel regardless and even wear a mask at the resort. Again, personal choice."
Here! Here! SG. Glass half full or glass have empty!
"Me I'm more a ""glass has lots of room to put more rum in""... LOL."
"Thomasgran...In the US, we have a 15 minute test, that is quite like a home pregnancy test(for lack of a better description). They are $119. Current production is being accelerated. Medical clearance forms can be completed by your family doctor days before you depart. I would liken it to Pre Admission testing we(US Residents) have to have completed prior to surgery. Right now, it includes a Covid Test one must have 2 days prior to surgery. As far as trip interruption, that is what CFAR Insurance and Evacuation Insurance is for. For US citizens, traveling without both is fool hearty."
"It's Jamaican SG but ""Ya Mon""!"
I agree that travelling without insurance cover is foolhardy. Our health authorities here say they have found an antibodies test that works but it is not in production yet. All other antibodies tests so far have turned out to be inaccurate so have been abandoned. The test to see if you currently have the virus has to go to a lab to be tested here.
Personally I would prefer a temperature check because if someone is running a fever I would not want to be eating or near that person at the resort. This seems a better set of rules than the RUI ones though.
"HiPersonally, I think the problem that hoteliers will run into are with some of the guests who once they get on holiday and have a few drink they will let their guard down and either forget or even ignore the restrictions / precautions that have been put in place to protect them. fellow guests and staff alike"
"I agree with Flip. Many people think a virus can't effect them, especially when drunk. Vac insurance hasn't been covering the Pandemic unless you had cancel for any reason which is more expensive so check before buying."
