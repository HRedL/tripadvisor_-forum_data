"Nepal to ban travel from Europe, West Asia and Japan to be effective Fridayhttps:/…"
A notice to confirm this should appear on the official immigration website in due course:http://www.nepalimmigration.gov.np/scoodly
"Still not enough to be really clear, why not from everywhere else where the coronavirus circulates, that means more or less from the whole world ?.Well I understand Nepal cannot afford to completely ban travel from India and China."
"Yes it's true information! Soon notice will be everywhere and the governmet meeting already decided about it guys!Edited: 10:19 am, March 18, 2020 "
"####Well I understand Nepal cannot afford to completely ban travel from India and China.####Well... If China Covid-19 reporting is reliable (13 new cases, including 12 imported cases yesterday 17/03), the outbreak is under control. China is probably now one of the safest area around the word.Fabrice"
"In addition to this travel ban, Nepal government is taking strong confinement measures:- no more than 25 persons at one place (what about the bazar, the sanctuaries...).- schools closed. Same for cinema halls, sport venues, recreation centers...- wash your hands communication.With no declared cases (only one and recovered!), this is much surprising, let's say contradictory.For avoiding imported cases, travel ban would be enough, if respected.Most probably, the Covid-19 outbreak is already running wild in Nepal, obliging the governement to take this measures. I hope nepalese people will not suffer too much of this Covid-19.Fabrice"
"Yes from the start the Nepal government décisions on coronavirus are obscure. I share the question mark about some kept hidden presence of coronavirus.Edited: 4:45 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"If people truly believe there has only been one case of COVID-19 in Nepal they are very gullible. In Australia a couple of weeks ago, one of our cases in Tasmania was a Nepalese guy who travelled back to Nepal, returned to Hobart and developed symptoms of coronavirus within days. He continued to work and go out clubbing while he had symptoms and awaiting test results, despite being told he needed to self-isolate. I really strongly doubt he was unlucky enough to have come in contact with the one and only recorded coronavirus carrier in Nepal."
Non one believes. Even Nepali people don't believe.
"Australian government communications are no less confused and obscure based on trying to find the balance between economic control and the health system.The professional body of teachers sent out an email saying they were closing the office to protect staff. Mean while the teachers ( who they represent) are still in government schools, albeit with dwindling numbers of students. Independent schools are closing in general.One of the first things I read about Nepalese ways was that as general polite social process, a Nepali will just want to say ‘yes’...to directions for instance. Thus one had learn how to ask questions. Corruption aside, I do find it odd that at times, westerners want to have Western thinking in a Nepalese system.As to western thinking, well let’s see.....Trump, BJ, ScoMo and Dutton here in Ozz, the list goes on.To hide the odd fact might be a positive expedient, but to be sure, that is often nuanced and a leap of faith."
"All passengers, including Nepalis, flying in from Europe, the UK, West Asia, and the Gulf will not be allowed into the country until April 15. https://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/03/1…"
"""Movement from China, however, has remained inexplicably open.""WTF???"
ScoMo on Friday: You can go to watch football. I am also goingScoMo on Sunday: Crowds of more than 500 is banned.
Update: Chinese mainland reports zero increase in domestically transmitted COVID-19 cases @ xinhuanet.com/english/…c_138894480.htm
