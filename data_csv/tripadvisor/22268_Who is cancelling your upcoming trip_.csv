"We have plans to be in Japan from Apr 1-14, and just saw an announcement that due to COVID-19, Tokyo’s Nakamerguro district has made the decision to cancel the annual sakura festival, and no spectators will be allowed for NPB games through March 15th. I know a lot can change for the better or worse in one months time, but it would be heartbreaking to take this trip and not get the full experience. Are you waiting and seeing? Cancelling now? We have until mid-March before seeing cancellation fees on hotels- flights will be much trickier unless there are flight restrictions imposed."
"I wasn’t planning to cancel, but United is suspending flights to Tokyo already (now-april 30). At this point, I want to stay in the USA and visit Japan when everything is back to normal. The last thing I want is to stuck in Japan due to return flight cancellation."
"I haven't cancelled yet (flying out from Australia end of March) but it's looking more and more likely every day. My only cost would be a $200 cancel fee for the airfare, which might even be waived if Australia bumps Japan up to Level 3 (currently Level 2). I'm sad about probably having to cancel, but being an older person, and a teacher, it seems the responsible thing to do - both for me and all the children I spend all day with."
"We're due to fly to Japan from NZ in April, am watching closely. We haven't cancelled yet, but will if there's even slim likelihood of needing to self-quarantine while there or on our return."
"I was referring to information from United website. They are basically saying that they are suspending based on low demand, not virus threat, thus Newark is still on.If they don't cancel flights out of Newark, I’ll have no choice but go and enjoy Japan."

"I am scheduled to go to Japan (flying in to Osaka) this coming Wednesday, March 4 for a month. My daughter is studying over there and she has this month off and it would be my only chance to see her all year.Little by little, concerns about the coronavirus have been causing us to modify the original itinerary. Original itinerary included 10 days in S. Korea. Have cancelled that now and re-routed to an itinerary -- Okayama, Yamaguchi, Kumamoto, and Kagoshima. All those places, according to a chart of the coronavirus in various prefectures I read, have low incidence of coronavirus.However, the last week of the trip was going back up to Tokyo to help my daughter move out of her sharehouse, see her college, and meet her host mother, then finishing up with 3 days at Tokyo DisneyMade the decision to avoid Tokyo. I have just cancelled all the Tokyo parts and am about to reschedule the flight home, cutting off 1 week of the trip.I am hoping with these modifications will be okay, but am monitoring the situation. Really don't want to cancel. I wont' see my daughter this year if I do. But watching and waiting."
""" The last thing I want is to stuck in Japan due to return flight cancellation.""Yeah imagine having to stay a month due to it."
"Here's United's website. https:/…notices.html""Wait and see"" is the only sound advice these days. No one really knows what will happen. Meanwhile, everyone and their best friend (families with kids, teenagers with their friends, students, couples, singles, dog walkers , grandmas and grandpas) must be walking around my neighborhood train station! The 100 yen store, supermarkets, shops, restaurants are all PACKED! Not very many people are ""laying low"" and staying home. It's a too pretty of a day to waste on a February 29 that won't come around for another 4 years! Life goes on."
"I'm monitoring the situation right now and see how it plays out. i have 11 days of vacation coming up end of march/early april. my plan was for japan, i'm dead set on it even though i havent booked my flights or JR pass.i'm also looking into possibilities of going to europe instead of japan."
"""i'm also looking into possibilities of going to europe instead of japan."" - Given what is happening in Italy I would probably rather risk it in Japan!"
"If your flight is cancelled while in Japan, an airline will usually try to accommodate you on a different flight with partner. If United cancels your flight, they will try to put you on an ANA or other star alliance flight so I would not worry about flight cancellation. I would worry about being quarantined in your home country upon arriving from Japan."
"I am booked on a tour, end of March, not sure yet if they will allow me to cancel.Not going to be enjoyable with the Virus threat.Postponing my trip will be a great weight off my mind."
"As of now, my return flight has disappeared from booking details without any communication from ANA or United."
"HI allI have canceled my trip to Osaka for Feb 27 . It was very disappointing for me as I was looking forward to this trip for many months.I e-mailed 2 hotels in Japan and asked for a full refund (for my non-refundable bookings) because of the Coronavirus outbreak risk and thankfully they gave me a full refund. If you have non refundable bookings, just try to contact the hotels in Japan to request them to waive the cancellation fee. They will advise you to contact your booking agent (expedia, or Agoda, etc.) to cancel and the booking agent will in turn contact the hotels to confirm that they agreed to refund the money. After that they will refund your booking in full.I also bought 2 sim cards from Klook to be picked up in Osaka and they also refund my purchase after I requested it (eventhough it was supposed to be non refundable.)For my United flight, I received credit to be used within 1 year and a rebooking fee.To reduce your loss, just try to contact all the vendors and request a refund. The Japanese hotels seem to be very understanding."
"I bought ticket on Asiana, though they haven’t cancelled any flights yet, I am cancelling my upcoming trip (April 8-18). This was going to be my daughter’s much anticipated trip, unfortunately I don’t feel like taking her now is a good idea. Hopefully next year.Edited: 12:17 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"We are going March 30-April 9. Five nights in Tokyo and five in Kyoto. We are not canceling at this point. Tokyo has less than 40 cases with Kyoto having 2 cases. And it’s not been exploding like South Korea or Italy. I’m not overly concerned.Edited: 12:33 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"Our trip is planned voor march 9th , our country raised the traveladvice to level 2. you can go, but be aware...so KLM is not refunding at this point.Have contacted Agoda just in case, and JRP railpass ..If and when the traveladvice is elevated to level 3 , KLM will refund, JRP wil refund about 80 %, and Agoda will assist in refund from the hotels."
"I am scheduled to leave for Tokyo and Kyōto on March 22. For the past few weeks our family has been firmly in the “still going” camp, however since so many museums and events will be shut down we are reconsidering this trip. If we decide to cancel we will go next year!"
"We this week cancelled our trip scheduled for March 26-April 28. We've been planning this trip for months, had developed (with much help from TripAdvisor Japan board members) a fantastic itinerary. We are in our late 60s and mid 70s, and the US govt. is warning elders not to go to Japan. But the main reason is we couldn't imagine a Japan trip without onsen visits, without sushi restaurants, without museums and other closings. Next year!"
I and my husband are going to travel in Japan 20.03 - 03..04. I am waiting still what will happen but I think I will be forced to cancel the trip. As I saw today many of the museums will be closed till 15.03.20. Nobody knows what will be after that. I am loosing 250 USD for canceling the flight but I prefer to вулфн my dream trip in future :( Because if most of the interesting places will be closed I do not want to be disappointed with my dream vacation :)
"Up until about a day ago, I was still in the NOT canceling camp. But as others have said, the closures of many attractions has definitely made me reconsider traveling at this time (we leave the US on March 19). Right now it's a wait and see game.Just in case, I'm looking at options if I reschedule to mid June."
"Unfortunately, that decision was sort of made for us a couple weeks ago. I was so disappointed since this would have been my first time in Japan. I had a whole itinerary planned out. Thank goodness we didn't buy our JR Rail passes yet.We were to be leaving March 1st for a 2 week trip to Japan. A few days would have been for a conference in Tokyo. The rest of the time was ours. The conference has been postponed until the fall. Luckily, we were able to cancel our flight with no fees and we will not have to pay any re-booking fee when we reschedule. All hotels cancelled and refunded no issues.We definitely would have gone if it wasn't postponed. However, there were some things we were planning that were either affected by construction or closures due to the current situation.So, we're taking a short trip to Nashville to ease our disappointment. I've never been there either.I'll keep up to date on this forum in the meantime! Everyone is so helpful and nice to eachother here! Can't wait to reschedule!"
"We are coming over in June hopefully the virus scare is gone by then , I know Japan has Olympics this year and if it does not go ahead and ban flights luckily I paid by credit card so will be covered, bit worried also as was in Beijing June last year and my visa is still in date as China visas last for 2 years so if I do fly there maybe a high chance me and wife will get pulled over at customs and checked but hopefully they look at my exit date stamp"
"In the process of cancelling. Husband’s work currently has a mandatory 2 week quarantine upon return if he goes. We were leaving April 8th. 2 adults/2 kids. Hotels have already been refunded, even the non-refundable was accommodating. Airline (American) still has cancellation fees so waiting to see if anything changes with them."
"""In the process of cancelling. Husband’s work currently has a mandatory 2 week quarantine upon return if he goes"" - yea knowing that he would have to undergo a mandatory 2 week quarantine upon return makes the decision much easier."
@#27 disappointing but Japan is quite nice in the Fall as well so all is not lost! Right now with some of the closures etc you likely wouldn't have been able to experience everything you wanted. Hopefully this gets resolved in the next few months to the point where things get back into full swing.
"This is a list of closures so far https://www.japan.travel/en/news/coronavirus/castles/temples/parks are open , for as far as I know.Enough to see , the only park we cant see or need to rechedule is Universal Osaka."
Just cancelled but speaking with my tour guides in Japan i felt it was for the best i want to enjoy the whole experience of Japan without the worry of health issues and places that are closed i will re book in the future
"I'm still travelling towards the end of March. I'm concerned about the amount of things that might still be closed but as long as I can still see cherry blossom and visit temples, shrines, eat and go shopping then I will travel. (No refund available yet for the airfare so very expensive to cancel)"
"Still going, end of March. Don't really care for the things that are closed now and assume they'll start opening up again around then."
I'm in the same boat. Just watching and waiting. Hope we don't have to cancel. So much invested in this trip with my grandies but like you... Have responsibilities. We will be going unless the govt ups to do not travel. Insurance does not cover speculationn. Good luck. And hope things ckear up a bit in two weeks so we all can go.
"Waiting it out. We're leaving on April 3rd and returning to Canada April 17th. No plans on cancelling now though, given that there's only a Level 1 advisory in Canada. The next 14 days or so are the most critical to see how this will play out, so we're holding our decision until around March 14th. If it's a GO for us, we'll just take the appropriate measures - we planned on bringing masks, sanitizer and wipes anyway. Luckily I got travel insurance when I purchased tickets, and our AirBnB bookings are covered under their ""extenuating circumstances"" policy."

"We cancelled. Unfortunately, we have been sick with the flu, my oldest child has a history of pneumonia, doctor recommended for the children to not travel. But either way, we would have cancelled. This would have been our first time to Japan, and we want to be able to have the best time. As a parent, I would have been so stressed out making sure all three children washed their hands constantly, didn't touch their eye, nose, mouth, and I think I would crazy if I noticed any mild symptom of a cold. Really looking forward to be able to go next year."
"re: @#31 - red259- Keeping our fingers crossed they get a handle on this quickly. Just looked up the average temps in Tokyo in September and that sounds perfect!We were planning to visit Miyajima island so I think September will be best for sure.

"#41: And yes, September can have beautiful weather, though there can still be days with highs in the high 30s (Celsius) and humidity."
We too were coming for Sakura but made the tough decision last week to cancel when CDC went to Level 2. We are senior citizens and besides not wishing to take any unnecessary risks we also learned our travel insurance would not cover medical in Japan if it involves the virus. There is always next year and our decision is strictly for us and not a recommendation for going or cancelling.
"i was hopeful that I can go to japan, but looks like its becoming more dim. i told some of my coworkers that I might go to japan next month, and they were like, ""WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING, dont you know how dangerous japan is right now coz of the virus."" i just shook my head and facepalmed myself.I just rolled my eyes, and can't believe what they said. but there's a lot of mis-education, racism, and ignorance about the corona virus here in America, and i just find it really sad. and then there's a coworker who is going to England, france, belgium, and netherlands in the next couple weeks, and it's like the exact opposite. ""HEY HAVE FUN IN EUROPE, THAT'S GONNA BE ONE FUN TRIP""i'm probably not going to go to japan because my work involves me dealing with a lot of people in the customer service industry, and even though i feel safe to go to japan, i don't wanna risk and take a chance. it's not about me at this point, but for the customers i deal withEdited: 1:18 am, March 02, 2020 "
"@Lost: sad that you’re not going to go. And I agree there’s a lot of racism going on around the virus. Ironically, they said the virus might have come from Europe..."
"I’m on the fence about going. I want to, but also don’t want to want to catch it either. Latest death being in my age range from Ny. Only the person came from Iran. This was gonna be a birthday trip for me and my friend’s teen daughter. I told myself that I’ll ultimately decide next month if things don’t improve. I haven’t booked my trip yet, but watching this closely both online news, vloggers and cdc and travel advisories. Anyone think I should go? I was going for a kimono photoshoot. If all else fails, I’ll go this time next year. :( if outbreak stops by then"
"I've already cancelled my visit due to start 5th Mar, a few days away. Total loss was £500 (partial refund of airfare) but I was fortunate in that other stuff like travel insurance (expensive for us)Car to airport, foreign exchange and so on, I had delayed purchasing . My advice to anyone considering cancelling is check with your airline/agent/hotel - if no refund is coming, don't cancel until the last moment if you have nothing to lose. It may be that if others cancel, the operator may cancel, if you cancel too soon, you may lose out in that event."
"My partner and I are scheduled to arrive in Japan on the 14th of March heading to Hakuba for a week and then onto Hiroshima and then Singapore. Not sure what to think at this stage some people are for not cancelling and others not, is anyone in Japan at the moment that feels uneasy or has heard of any dramas getting back to Aus? So confused as to what to do"

"I cancelled 3 tickets 72 hours before my flight for a departure today for Tokyo for 10 days. I luckily incurred no loss for the 3 flights- as I had booked with points. Delta was even kind enough to reimburse all fees and taxes and waive the ridiculous $150 redeposit fee without me even asking!My only loss is 3 nights lodging in Tokyo via booking.com. I was able to cancel Kyoto lodging for free.I decided it would not be a stress free vacation, living behind a face mask and worry about every cough and sneeze. Japan will always be there- I will go back once the crisis is over.Edited: 10:30 am, March 02, 2020 "
I have an 8 week trip planned at the end of March and the only thing that is going to stop me is if governments tell me I either can't leave the UK or enter Japan or the airlines stop flying for the same reason. Assuming none of these things happen then I will look forward to a less touristy experience and will be happy to spend my money in businesses that maybe under threat from the hysteria that this virus is bringing. I could postpone the trip but then I could get stuck at home by the virus anyway! If I had a medical condition or was older then I would be giving serious consideration to postponement. Live your life!
"Glad to hear you're not put off Maria! We're in the same situation, though only going for two weeks. I've been a bit worried that Asiana Airlines might cancel our flight, as we're flying from Heathrow to Tokyo via Seoul, but everything seems fine so far.We also rebooked a couple of hotels as they're now coming up a lot cheaper and we've saved £300 !"
"Still on the fence here. Supposed to leave on the 18th. Currently everything is still non refundable but I got the impression from Hilton that they may be able to refund or at least postpone our hotel. It’s hard to cancel when we got so lucky the Sakura blooms early this year. Since we have to go when the kids are off school next year will most likely be too early to see full bloom. Also I purchased a lot of clothing for the 4 of us the trip (yes it sounds silly but we live in a very warm climate so it was necessary) and have been learning some Japanese. But there is currently a lot of fear and ignorance here. I have friends who have told me if we go they won’t hang out with me or my family for a month, and one who even threatened to make an anonymous call to my son’s school telling them he went (not that we are hiding it). So now we have the added worry that we will be ostracized upon our return. Silver lining at least I’m learning who my real friends are."
"@meliward413: That is very sad. Yes, there is a lot of ignorance (and racism) going on around the virus situation. When I come back from my Japan trip (hopefully that's going to happen), I will voluntarily isolate myself from unnecessary contacts for 2 weeks. But to have someone tell me they won't hang out with me or threaten to call my son's school, that's a different story..."
"I'm meant to fly out at the end of May for 2 weeks and currently the only thing that will make me cancel is IF:1. My flights get cancelled.2. The UK officially issues a warning against travelling to Japan.3. Tokyo Disneyland remains closed. (Cuz that's one of the big reasons I want to go haha)Hopefully, none of these things will happen and I can still go :) Guess we'll find out in the next couple of months."
"Cancelled ski trip in Hakuba in mid-Feb - flight to Tokyo postponed to May with a minor admin fee (option offered by the carrier). Host in Hakuba onsen hotel and Tokyo hotel did not charge any penalty to my late cancellations (< 72 hours) due to announcement by their Minister of Health on 14th Feb.Okinawa - flight in mid-March was cancelled by the carrier in late Feb with full refund in progress. Subsequently, have cancelled all hotel and rental car bookings with no penalty.I’d visit Japan when this epidemic is over. It won’t be enjoyable to worry/stress about all the potential risks/consequences, e.g. being quarantined in Japan or back home.ps. those who deem that the confirmed cases are lower in Japan might check out comment #43 by Dr. Shibuyakko on post titled as ""I'm still going to Japan""."
"At this point, high chance we will rebook to this autumn. Our travel dates are end of March to first week of April. If our government would announce a travel ban, would be better. We want to make decisions at the very last minute but we already have 3 contingency plans lol all our Airbnbs except for 1 are fully refundable."

">> I have friends who have told me if we go they won’t hang out with me or my family for a month, <<I don’t see that as unreasonable since right now, the best way to avoid getting the virus is to avoid contact with infected people and like it or not, you are exposed to that risk by travelling to a country with a rising number of cases and which is not showing itself to be very transparent or competent in its handling of the virus (in the Diamond Princess case, even MInistry of Health staff got infected which showed poor safety precautions being taken, not isolating Japanese passengers who disembarked, the low number of tests being done, etc).

We are still coming first June so far... the only thing that concerns us is having to self isolate on return as we have a very small business that cannot be closed for that time .....
We cancelled our trips March 22 - 31. Japan airlines put on their website free cancellation for eligible tickets and ours meet the criteria. What is the point of going if a lot of tourist attraction places are closed.
We decided to cancel when CDC raised level to 2. We are seniors and learned that our travel insurance would not cover if the virus was deemed a pandemic or epidemic. We have fortunately been able to cancel everything with no penalty and hopefully we will see the Cherry Blossoms next year.
I'm doing the same. I feel JAL and Ana will waive cancellation fees. Its not our fault. I was taking my daughter and two grandies on 20th..so upset at missing out but can't risk it. My health took a tail spin last week also so I can't travel now anyway. Good luck

"I was going to be in Japan the same period but have cancelled as a travel advisory was issued for non-essential travel to Japan by the Ministry of Health of the country I’m in.

"We were going to go leaving 26 March with Singapore Air to visit our daughter and grandchildren in Osaka.Our daughter said it might be better to delay our trip as they don’t know what will happen and at the moment have been told to stay indoors.Singapore Air won’t refund our tickets but we can change dates of travel for free up until 31 August. We’re thinking of delaying our trip to late May.I’ll lose about $300 AUD because the hotel in Singapore is non refundable, but I can cancel the hotels in Japan for free.I do wonder though if things will be better or worse by late May. I wish Singapore Air would just refund our fares like JAL has."

"Our cruise for May 9-25 2020 was cancelled early in Feb we received total refund from the cruise ship. Waiting on Air Canada to do something about cruise cancellations . Good luck with sites.Our cruise was from Japan, Beijing Shanghai returning to Vancouver from Hong KongEdited: 9:54 pm, March 09, 2020 "
that is so sad! let them be that way!
"My trip is not until mid July to Mid August (including Taiwan and South Korea). Coming to Tokyo for the Olympics and then trips to Kyoto and Osaka. So, all that being said, if things have not improved by then, the virus will be a global pandemic and it won't matter where you live. I am keeping my reservations until the very last minute!"
"We aren’t going till first week June hoping all this will be better, not worried about virus . Worried about getting stuck overseas or having to self isolate for 2 weeks"
"Same here, Lillybells. We just cancelled our trip (set for March 31 - April 17) not so much out of health concerns as out of logistical ones: having flights changed or cancelled and not being able to get home, having to self-quarantine after our trip (one of our party is a schoolteacher and was told by her job she'd have to self-quarantine for 14 days before coming back to work, at no pay), possibly getting stuck in quarantine while in Japan, etc. We also worry about the possibility of spreading the virus unknowingly to our community here at home, especially our elderly family members, so we'd feel compelled to self-quarantine after visiting Japan no matter what.While I'm sad to miss this long-planned trip (especially when I hear how there are no crowds!) I know we'll return when things are better. The many risks of going now are just too high."
"Laughingarcher, it's in your backyard already, so please follow the prevention procedure and take care anyway.https:/…Coronavirus"
We are about to cancel but wanted to ask if anyone travelling to Tokyo in April was able to secure a refund from Hoshinoya ? It’s a bit of a long story but it would be good to hear anyone else’s experience.
We ended up cancelling our trip to Tokyo this week largely out of fear of being caught in quarantine when we tried to return. Received refunds or credit on almost everything.Only disappointment was Tokyo DisneySea which while closed would not automatically refund dated tickets but required us to call Japan?!? Teamlab Borderless simply refunded. Why is that so hard for Disney?
"I didn't cancel outright but I did reschedule my trip to Tokyo from late April to late October. I was mainly more concerned about quarantine than actually getting sick. It took a while to get everything (flights, Airbnb, etc) rescheduled but was finally able to do it with all normal fees waived."
We cancelled ours 3 hours before departure. Was going to fly out on Mar 8. Too much unknowns. It wasn't going to be an enjoying trip if we had to worry about everything the whole trip.
"As WHO have categorised this as a Pandemic, it will make it easier for some people to cancel and claim on insurance. It is one of the requisites in a lot of travel policies."
"Finally made the decision today to postpone our April trip to August. Not ideal but I think it was the best compromise. Hopefully the panic will have subsided and people will start making rationale policy decisions by then (here in the U.S.). Also, hoping that Japanese baseball season is back on track by that point - a key item on our itinerary. Now I have to get to work on trying to get my current flights refunded (cross my fingers) and finding new flights that will work."
"Absolutely correct, Global. All schools in Seattle have closed as of today, most events cancelled (my daughter worked so hard on her Emerald City ComiCon costume!), retirement homes restricting visitors, etc. We're being very cautious. :-)I've managed to cancel all of our reservations so far without fees except for one: We bought JR Passes and Ghibli Museum tix from JTB USA, who are telling me if we cancel they will refund only 50% of our cost. This includes our JR Passes, despite the fact that Japan Rail has authorized 100% refunds. JTB USA's excuse is that we bought our passes as ""part of a package"" and so don't qualify for the 100% refund. Hmph.I just saw on the Ghibli website that they are not pre-selling tickets for April. Our advance tix are for April 6. I've asked Ghibli to confirm whether or not they'll be open then. If not, our tix will be null and void. Let's see JTB USA refuse to refund our money then! ;-)"
I'm surprised to see that the number of infected cases and that of total deaths by Covid-19 in the U.S.A. have surpassed those of Japan. Why?
"Why? In a nutshell...... because many people won't go to the hospital until the last minute because medical costs are expensive. If you wait too long, even the top of the art technology can't save you. In Japan, we all have National Health Insurance and wouldn't blink an eye about visiting a doctor if we feel sick. In the US, many people won't go because they can't ""afford"" it. It's not uncommon to go bankrupt because you are ill. That's one of the reasons there are so many GoFundMe sites."
US failed to test correctly potential cases.
"#101Mr. Abei, it spread at an elderly home. That is one of the reasons they are a lot of death. Americans have more chronic diseases than Japanese. Japan is No.6, but US No.3 in Diabetes."
"from Europe - Finnair allowed to change March flights to autumn, and small aparthotel in Kyoto was kind to also change dates (even when free cancelling time was already over)."
"I knew the difference in Heath Insurance System and many Americans cannot afford to see doctors easily, but I didn't want to be rude to Americans. Also, although it can explain the high mortality by the virus in the U.S.A., many Japanese physicians including me are not working hard for this infection yet, because those candidate patients are mostly seen at ""Hokenjo"" at first, followed by limited number of large hospitals. Even my ex-colleagues in the University Hospital are not seeing many of those patients. Thus, I thought it might be the difference in the lifestyle of ordinary Japanese and Americans, such as we don't usually shake hands but only bow each other which may explain the difference in the number of infected people."
"“But I didn’t want to be rude to Americans...”Don’t let this one fool you, people. The deflecting and excuses will keep coming. No matter how rude they are."
Our tour company we booked with is Wendy Wu and we heard today they are suspending all travel to Japan till 14 April. We were departing Sydney on 27th March. Don't know if we will get a credit or a full refund. We booked our flights with Flight Centre and have till the 31 May 2020 to either change dates for another flight or if we decide we want a refund we will each loose $900 each person. We are happy to rebook tour of Japan for cherry blossom season next March if Wendy Wu can give dates so we can re book our flights. Japan still on our list....Vicki
"Hi,I often wonder reading these posts what did people decide to do when the situation changed.So here it is - we were due to fly 25th March for our 8 week trip but things are escalating in the UK right now (my running club and Tri club have cancelled all training for foreseeable future and many, many cultural and sporting events are cancelled for example).We are cancelling our trip. AirBnB have a very flexible policy up until 14 April. JTB travel in London refunded our rail passes less £45 admin fee each. Kumano Kodo are processing cancellation as booking was more than 20 days in advance. This just leaves a couple of AirBnBs that would not be flexible for May (I guess it is still a little way off) so for these have asked to reduce number of guests to reduce cost and will raise with the travel insurance.I hope the situation changes for the better soon and people can travel without worry.Maria."

"I've cancelled all hotels and just waiting on the EU decision today in the hopes my flights (which is leaving on sunday) are cancellable else I will rebook. I'm flabbergasted anyone is considering making the trip in the next few weeks, especially Europeans considering the actions of EU governments in the last few days. I foolishly thought living in a remote village and being able to work from home would make it all OK. Got to do your bit to curb this pandemic. It's not just about my health but anyone I could potentially infect. No country is going to be able to handle it if we don't all stop non-essential travel."
"RE:#110, we are also planning to fly from LAX to NRT on 3/25 and bar government restrictions, we still plan to go. We have non-refundable hotel reservations but plane tickets that can be pushed out. I've been scouring the forums and life seems more relaxed and normal than in California so we're using the time to get away from the craziness here. We are healthy but plan to bring masks and sanitizers with us."
"People from California have to self quarantine for 14 days in a hotel on arrival, no? I thought I heard that last night."
"Keith,Even if the order is not in place, they should be quarantined. I don't understand why some people are still considering taking a non-essential trip now. The state of California is pretty much shut down. Almost everything is closed and we're asked to stay home as much as possible. Here are the guidelines from the county in which #112 lives:"" Less Vulnerable Populations:All those at lower risk should stay home to the maximum extent possible except when going to essential sites.​​Essential sites include but are not limited to:Health Care FacilitiesGrocery storesPharmaciesHardware stores/plumbers/electricians for emergency servicesBusinesses that provide food, shelter and social services, and other necessities of life for economically disadvantaged or otherwise needy individualsNewspapers, television, radio and other media servicesGas Stations and auto supply, auto repair and related facilitiesBanks and related financial institutionsPlumbers, electricians, exterminators and others who provide services that are necessary to maintaining the safety, sanitation and essential operation of residencesAirlines, taxis and other private transportation providers."" https:/…default.aspxThe vast majority of hotels in Japan would refund ""nonrefundable"" reservations in an emergency. So call the hotel and find out. Taking non-essential international travel at this time is irresponsible even if you're young and healthy. It's not all about you."
"Thanks Shibuyakko, I thought it was odd to see someone from a lockdown place still planning to ignore that and then come here. Yesterday’s shop owners and cafe owner making negative comments about European tourists was a new one for me. “Why are they here? Scary.”It’s nice that Japanese hotels are refunding rooms. My place in the Netherlands is still charging me for 5 nights in a country under lockdown this week!? Dutch thieves I guess?"
That really sucks about your hotel not refunding. I hope you get it back somehow!
"Yes, thank you, especially when I contacted them before the two weeks before cancellation deadline to say I wasn’t sure if I’d be going and wanted to cancel before they charged me and if I ended up going, I would rebook with them if they still had availability and they replied telling me not to cancel and I could wait and if I cancelled, I’d get my money back!? All of that was in the Booking .com messaging system but they can’t do anything even though the agent I spoke to said he read the messages and it was very clear!? “It’s up to the owner.”"
"For my May trip to Japan I was clinging on to hope very long, but in the past few days it became clear that this trip is not going to happen. Now the EU travel ban, Japan's quarantine requirements and FinnAir's flight cancellations have definitely put an end to this.At least I should get the money for the flights back and I don't care too much about the roughly 200 € I lose in non-refundable Hotel and tour guide bookings. These people will most likely be having a tougher time this year than I.Anyhow, I am looking forward to give it another shot next year and hopefully do my part in helping the Japnese tourism industry back on it's feet.Thanks to everyone who provided insight on this forum and helped planning my trip (even if you didn't reply to any threads directly started by me – I was reading a lot of older posts).Stay safe & healthy everyone!Edited: 7:30 am, March 19, 2020 "
"Yeah we're cancelling now for end of March, unless by some miracle the world is cured........Probably going to rearrange for red leaves season."
I've been trying to cancel our flights for two weeks.. Daily phonon ng it messaging and emails to Budget Air and JAL. Well departure is 4 hours from now.. Today and we are not in Sydney due to travel restrictions alert level four. Budget just sent me a message.. Please supply all booking details.. Sorry we have been busy etc.. Ahahaha.. Leaving it a tad late guys.. Guess whose going to have a Huge fight on. Their hands if I am penalised in any way. Advice? Book your tickets directly through the airlines.. You may save a few hundred going to an online agent but it just isn't worth the angst when things like disasters or Corona Virus are thrown in the mix. JUST SAYING!
"I agree with Jill in post 120- book direct with the airline. We made the difficult decision to cancel with JAL last week when the free cancellation came up for our dates. After a few clicks it was done. The next day, the full amount was back in my bank account.Next time I’ll be more than happy to pay a little extra once again to fly with JAL- great space, great service.Edited: 7:42 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"Our flight has been cancelled by JAL. Our whole state is in lockdown. So yep, definitely postponing... the question is when..."
Update? Budget rang me yesterday arvo.. Asked for all my details again.. Then explained I'd missed my flight. JAL would charge me $600 per booking missed flight fee!! That's $2400.. Spewin' I begged them to fight for me.. They did send an email explaining situation... Its up to JAL now if they don't refund I'm totally screwed.. $2974 down the gurgle...
"The final piece of a trip booked since October for the end of March/beginning of April is now cancelled and we have received a full refund from United. There have been too many what ifs leading up to this but a few weeks back when the Niece was told her Mom (who was not on the trip) would not be able to go to work at a drugstore for two weeks after we returned, we knew it needed to be cancelled and I slowly began dismantling the trip for us and 2 nephews. It would affect too many people adversely. Then with the Shelter in Place orders for SF and CA plus the horror stories of people unable to return to the US, we would have been extremely selfish to push through. We count ourselves lucky not to have been charged any cancellation fees. I hope everyone will come out as lucky and hope all stay safe and healthy during this uh unprecedented crazy time we are in.Edited: 1:06 pm, March 22, 2020 "
