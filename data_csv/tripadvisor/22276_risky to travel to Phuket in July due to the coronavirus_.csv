Lol. Come on. How do people on TA have any idea of what the situation will be like in July.
"You want thoughts and opinions from TA users on whether an entirely new strain of coronavirus (previously unknown to science) will be causing health problems in Phuket in July? 1) What kinds of answers are you expecting to get on here? 2) Have you done a forum search (or just scrolled through a few screens) to see the 300 coronavirus threads that have been posted in the last few weeks? Anyway, to answer your question - there’s unlikely to be a person on earth who could tell you whether Covid19 will pose a local or global health risk in July. If there is such a person, the Phuket forum page of TripAdvisor is probably not the best place to find them."
"The Thai tourist minister says this will all be over soon as the heat will blow it away. Maybe he is right.Who knows what the situation will be like in July, they don't even know about next week. I would check nearer the time."
"Just follow goverment advice,why anyone travels to Phuket from England in July amazes me you must like cold winters"
@kimwright191 - Phuket isn't cold in July - average temperatures are around 30 degrees C in the day and 23 at night. That is far from cold.Jx
"If you are worried, don't travel, as you will just spend your entire trip worryingPeople who are not worried are enjoying their holidays as normalI have just returned form a 7 week trip to SE Asia and looking for cheap Thailand flights for May. I guess you can say I'm not one of those worrying"
Think you should educate yourself with information from official sources.And then make an informed decision.
"And stop worrying.Edited: 7:01 am, February 24, 2020 "
"No need to make a decision right now. July, no shortage of hotels in most of Thailand. You can wait to the last minute to decide if you want to visit or not. Keep in mind that this Coronavirus thing is creeping across Europe. You are a lot closer to Italy and France than Thailand. Right now Italy has more cases than Thailand. Got a visit to Italy planned in the near future?? Has the count increased in the UK? https:/…-Put off making this big decision to fly to Thailand or not for a few months. It's July and not tomorrow you will be in Thailand! (If you actually go!)Edited: 7:12 am, February 24, 2020 "
Below recent ThaiVisa link has the current count for Coronavirus. https:/…Up to you.
This whole situation is very difficult for so many of us. We are needing to rely on what is unreliable news and information from a wide range of sources and then try to make some sense of it. Most certainly I wouldn’t be flapping about what might be the situation by July.
Maybe do a re-think if you were planning to visit some places in Europe as a substitute holiday trip. Hot off the press!https:/…link-6f2b7715
"Travelkat - you don’t need to rely on unreliable information or news reports. Rely solely on your home government’s official travel advice and, perhaps to a lesser extent, information from Thai Ministry of Health. Media reports, gossip, rumour, opinions from TA users and other social media should be absolutely ignored. Australian government travel advice for Thailand can be found here and is being updated regularly. https:/…thailand"
Other countries are banning their citizens from visiting Thailand such as UAE and Kuwait has suspended flights. Thailand does not have that many reported cases but maybe there is link back to Thailand in the cases in other countries?
Looks like Phuket maybe one of the safest places to be in july. Especially once the italians start travelling around europe.
