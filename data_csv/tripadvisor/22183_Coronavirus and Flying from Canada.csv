"I have already read many posts about people trying to decide whether they should still travel to Mayan Riviera in the next few weeks given that the Canadian government has recommended against all non essential travel. Most people say go for it. As much as I’d like to think lying on the beach with my family is considered essential travel, it probably isn’t. My concern really isn’t about actually getting the virus (maybe it should be). My concern is: what happens if the flights out of Mexico stop? Or back into Canada? As much of an extended stay in Mexico would be appealing to some, my bank account couldn’t support an additional week or two or three in Mexico waiting things out until we could get back to Canada. There are already some articles on the internet indicating that Mexico may be closing its borders to the US trying to prevent cases from getting in. Anyone else have these worries or just me?"
Your bank account should not be your concern. If you don’t care about catching the virus yourself (carriers may not display symptoms) at least take the means not to spread it and bring it back to the country. It’s because of irresponsible people that think only of themselves and ignore all advice that it had spread as it has and keeps spreading around the world. It takes an individual and collective effort to try to contain the disease.https://www.newsweek.com/young-unafraid-coro…
If you're in a high incidence area please stay put.
Your own government is basically telling you not to go. Why ask complete strangers what they think? You’ve indicated your back account couldn’t sustain you. Could it sustain you if you have to self quarantine for 2 weeks when you return?
"""Anyone else have these worries or just me?""With this latest development (the Canadian government issuing an advisory against ALL travel outside the country) and the very real possibility that if you leave, you may not be able to get back, then I don't think any of us with vacations scheduled in the next few weeks (at least) have much choice. Although I could afford to stay an extra few weeks at my destination, or even a month or two if it came to that, I don't think that's the point. Neither is the fact that waiting this virus thing out with my toes in the sand isn't without significant appeal. For me, it's the fact that I have a lot more faith in the Canadian government and, perhaps more importantly, the Canadian healthcare system than I do of the government and healthcare system of the country I'm scheduled to travel to.There's also the matter of travel health insurance coverage. I have a great policy through my husband's employer BUT I don't know if the fact that there's now an advisory in place that coverage is affected in any way. The only thing I can think of that would be worse that getting sick while away from home would be getting sick and NOT having health care insurance. As it's the weekend, I can't reach anyone to clarify this but at this point, I think it's academic.Good luck with whatever you decide."
"My entire family had planned to self isolate for 14 days upon our return. We had already taken into consideration how to do our part to ensure that we are not contributing to the problem, by potentially infecting others. So we were planning to do our part. When the trip cancellation insurance is refusing to pay, and the timelines for using trip vouchers are ridiculous. Currently there are already hundreds of thousands of people already on March Break... I was just wondering and throwing the question out there. I didn't expect to have my head bit off."
It is called working from home. :)
Thank you for your response. It was very helpful. I appreciate your insight.
Canada today has told its people to get home from wherever they are by whatever means possible while there are still commercial means. Hopefully that answers your question. Definitely not the time to leave your home country.
"JLL. the headline in my morning paper this morning read 'It's a Pandemic, not a Panic' Guess what, it is a panic. I thought it was a joke when I heard you couldn't buy toilet paper and had to take a visit the local Real Canadian Superstore to check it out. Rows upon rows of empty shelves. Unbelievable!!The Media and the government are not putting common sense into this but that's just my opinion and I'm far from being alone. I am not saying this is not a serious situation. The economic repercussions will be devastating to a lot of people along with the health problems that come with that. Trudeau now has an excuse for his economic woes. Imagine if this was the deadly 1918 Pandemic, what a mess we'ed be in with an actual reason to panic.Some will give you advise on here but a lot just want to tell you what to do, For me it's dammed if you do and dammed if you don't.Edited: 8:26 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"Sounds like you are trying to justify going, but there’s no way a “majority” of responsible adults would say “go for it.” Most Canadians I know (myself included) have cancelled their international March Break vacations,"
You can't seriously compare this to the 1918 pandemic. What has something that happened 100 years ago have anything to do with what is happening now?
"""What has something that happened 100 years ago have anything to do with what is happening now?""Because one killed millions and this one around 5,000. Yet people seem to act like this is a repeat of the 1918 Spanish flu."
We were supposed to travel to a Cancun today from Toronto and cancelled last night after there was an advisory to avoid ‘non essential travel’. Thanks goodness we did as my insurance updated FAQ’s and our medical insurance related to Coronavirus would not be void if I chose to leave the country after the advisory was issued!
"BeyondXYU, I never said I'd actually go and said that in another post. Being in Mexico at the best of times with their healthcare system worries me. So not trying to justify anything but saying maybe too much panic is siting in,  We've got two trips planned in U.S. One in Los Angeles in April to see Pearl Jam but that concert is canceled. Got our airfare back but sill awaiting on hotel because we booked through Hotwire. In the process of canceling out trip to Orlando on the 24th. Beachdog, again this is serious but not even close to what the 1918 outbreak was like especially with the death rate which is what Co Pilot just said."
No worries?  https:/…
Yeah and how many are walking around that haven't or won't get tested??
"Its not a case of panic, its a case of trying to prevent what happened in China, Iran and Italy where the sudden onset of sick people totally overwhelmed the healthcare system. Other countries are trying to make their citizens understand that if we curtail travel, reduce social interaction we can slow the infection onset. There will still be as many people who get sick but it will be over a longer period of time so that the hospitals can cope. There are a limited number of resources available in any healthcare system, no matter how big or advanced the country may be. Also, perhaps in time there might be a vaccine or more knowledge as to how to stop/cure this. We have to try to protect our most vulnerable who might get infected with this, because they are the ones who are not surviving it. From what I saw by travelling through the Cancun airport, they are not increasing screening or cleaning. I do not believe that they have the few cases reported as tourism is number one with them and if the actual number of cases came out that would negatively affect it.No vacation is worth risking the life of anyone and I wish a travel advisory had been in effect at the end of February."
"The “get home while you still can” announcement today sounds like a signal that international air travel and possibly even land border crossings to the US are possible closures in the next few days. As much as I like going to the sun in March, this year is not normal times."
I myself can not believe that people are still thinking of going after the last few days . Even if I had to lose the cost of my whole vacation I would not think about going. This is just my opinion but think hard of the people you may be endangering
"You are talking of going to Mexico? I guess taking a vacation to Toronto is so much better than going to Orlando, right?"
"Don’t go. As a country we need to work together on this, for the sake of elderly and vulnerable. Also for our health care workers so they do not become overwhelmed, like in Italy where they had to make terrible choices about who would get a ventilator and who would die without one."
"Sunwing just cancelled all flights to all sun destinations at 8pm tonight, effective March 17 to April 9. You can bet they are not going to be the only ones."
"Bars and restaurants are closing. Yes, I understand the problem but what is going to be the collateral damage. Big businesses will survive but a lot of independent ones will not. How many jobs especially the ones that involve tips etc. will be severely affected. I hope people realize that there is also health consequences involved with that.Edited: 11:44 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"WestJet has announced it is suspending scheduled commercial operations for all international and transborder flights, including the U.S., for a 30 day period at the end of the day March 22"

""".. unbelievably impossible ..""Quite believable. There are thousands of people all trying to cancel at the same time. Call centers have finite capacity.With westjet, I did not get a refund but I did get credit equal to 100% to the value of my trip valid for 365 days (wouldn't be surprised if that gets extended because they won't be flying many routes for a while now).I just hope they don't go out of business. We are going to find out shortly which businesses have deep pockets and those that don't."
Geordielass not even a credit to take a vacation within a year? I thought that’s what most airlines were doing
"We just got out of Mexico and people in CozumelWe’re starting to panic that they’d be stuck in Mexico with cut off insurance and no way home for weeks. Honestly,,, it was a relief when we took off . Rebook your vacation for this fall."
"Air Transat appeared to have revised their policy a little. I was due to fly to Cancun on April 4 on an Air Transat package. According to an email I received from them this morning, as their flights are being suspended, I have 24 months to use the trip credit"
Makes me want to give Air Transat my future business. What great news.
"Geordielass call back, maybe they’ll still offer you the 24 month credit? If not contact CBC and go public. Not fair to not offer you what people are getting 1 day later"
