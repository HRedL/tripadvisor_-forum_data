"I'm supposed to be flying to Oman next week. Does anyone know about the exact list of countries that might be banned, as according to this article?https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2…Since it looks like there are now 77 countries that have it, are all these countries banned or only the most severe countries? Just wanted to let if I need to last minute change my plans.Any updates would be great, thanks!https:/…locations-confirmed-cases.html"
"For correct updates, follow the WHO portal.There are no 'banned' countries, though some airlines have chosen to suspend flights in specific sectors. You have to follow your airline for such information. Oman has kept nearly 3000 people under quarantine, most of them self-q at home."
