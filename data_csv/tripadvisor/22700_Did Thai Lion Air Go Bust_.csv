"All flights cancelled for some reason. Hope they haven't gone under.Edited: 8:28 am, March 05, 2020 "
The same day that Flybe in the UK went belly up.
Their website is still active and I can't see any news about it.
"If you have any real information on this please tell us and cite your source. Or stop spreading this baseless rumour.There’s nothing – zilch, nada – in the Thai or other media. As above, website is active — I could book a flight for April."
OP just wrote a review about there flight been cancelled and then placed on a later flight.Not sure how a bust airline could place them on a later flight of thru no longer fly.Just another troll thread in a long line of troll threads of late.
Can someone please advise whether this has been confirmed or revealed as a mischievous rumour?

"Given the present issues due to the virus scaremongering, sadly many companies and organisations are battling to stay afloat financially, and this was the reason for my query."
