"I have two vacations taking place within a month:1) DH and I are taking a 5-day cruise Thanksgiving week to celebrate our 2nd anniversary2) The week before Christmas, my uncle and I are headed to NY for a ""bucket list"" trip--to see ""Madama Butterfly"" at The MetBut what am I doing, instead of nailing down final details for those trips? Spending every free minute I have on the VEGAS forum!!! My Vegas trip isn't until March, yet I can't seem to pry myself away from this forum, even though I have more pressing travel issues to take care of.....lolHow do I ""cure"" myself of my obsession with Vegas until my other two trips are finished? Anyone else have this happen?"
You dont lol
"Change the other two trips to ""Vegas Vacations""... problem solved!"
"I've already started planning my few days in Vegas for next August.I'm spending a few weeks through California and Vegas - but have yet to even venture onto the San Fran forums yet.I've just started understanding some of the acronyms like TI, V/P....Still - the thing that scares me most is the tipping and completely stuffing it up - which is why i have read every tipping thread there is.Edited: 8 years ago "
"Oh I know, I know. I'll be away from home most of the month of December, visiting four different cities, but you know I'll spend the entire month here instead of researching places where I'll actually BE. Vegas disease...!"
"Why would you want to ""cure the obsession""?????? Revel in it!!"
Slip a trip in next week...............HTR
"""- which is why i have read every tipping thread there is.""Holy Crap!!!! You must have started about 3 months ago!!!------mermaid, asking that question here is like walking into a bar and asking everyone if you have a drinking problem.Edited: 8 years ago "
"LOL!!! I need my Vegas ""hit"" every day."
"You seem to be suffering from a common syndrome known as selective obsessive-compulsive Vegasitis with a procrastination sidebar. Being in Vegas cures the itch but symptoms return upon boarding your return flight back home. Trust me, I'm your Doctor :) I'm prescribing a stat round trip ticket to Las Vegas and then continuous exposure to Margaritas and Lemon Martinis. Get well soon!"
"I'm in exactly the same scenario as you, we are going on holiday to tenerife in the canary islands 10thdec this year and new York on 19th december till Xmas day yet, every day I have to check the Vegas forum out even though were not going till march 17 2012. Roll on 5 nights in the bellagio can't wait :)"
What's wrong with you? How many votes to we get? Lmaoooooo<ducking and running>
"I love Vegas, but to see ""Madam Butterfly"" at the Met would be fulfilling, enlightening and memorable.Plan your third trip to Vegas :)I can relate: considering Bali next week, Hawaii first week in December, and South Florida for 2 weeks at the Holidays and I really want to squeeze a Vegas trip in there before I get to Vegas in January.We all need a little Vegas!"
"I'll tell you whats wrong with you, your you and not me. Im going to Vegas next week and your going on a cruise. Tough luck Buster! Only joking, at the moment i think anyone who doesnt go to Vegas on holiday is nuts. I have also got a week in Teneriffe to look forward to, dreading it! Kinda hope this Vegas fixation wears off really, theres so many other places i want to get to....... ....... Maybe just not yet though. Have a great time on the ship and NY."
There's a very simple reason for this issue of yours. We're a more interesting group of people so you'd rather hang out with us on here :)
"Selective obsessive-compulsive Vegasitis....lol!!This disease seems to be an epidemic!!Low, I've been waiting for that comment, and I had a feeling it would be you that made it.....thanks for not disappointing!:-D"
