"HiI am planning to settle in Germany on July 3rd. I don't have a job lined up, but will be freelancing, so no work contract to show to the border control. I'm a bit confused about the latest announcement from the German foreign minister. Does it mean that people currently living in the UK and Sweden will not be allowed to visit Germany from the 15th? If not allowed, does this apply to where you currently reside, or your passport? I have an Irish passport but I'm living in the UK. Thanks!"
"Yes, you can as long as you don't show any Covid-19 symptoms. Travel restrictions for EU and EEA citizens end June 15th."
"Mainzer, would the restrictions also end on June 15 for someone like me who is both an Irish and U.S. citizen and resides in the U.S. (as I have my whole life)? I assumed that given the number of cases in the U.S. restrictions against U.S. residents would continue regardless of the citizenships they hold. Thanks in advance for any insights you might have.Edited: 1:07 pm, June 04, 2020 "
"Well, that it's a bit tricky, Rutgers83. For American citizens the EU would have to recommend its member states to open the outer borders for tourists again - which is not even discussed right now except for in Greece it seems. But you could go through immigration with your Irish passport and wouldn't be bothered once Germany has all entry ways open again for EU citizens.Whether that's a responsible thing to do would be up to your good judgment, of course - and what restrictions the US may still have in place for returning travelers. The German government sees under 50 new infections per 100K people in 7 days as unproblematic and all European countries are currently below that mark (on average, as there are still regional or local hotspots with higher rates).Edited: 1:42 pm, June 04, 2020 "
"Yes, what you say is certainly reasonable; in fact, I would not travel at this point, hoping possibly by September. I actually think someone in my situation should not be permitted in, but maybe I am off base on that....Thanks for your help."
Does it mean that people currently living in the UK and Sweden will not be allowed to visit Germany from the 15th? --Are you confusing this for the Dutch regulations? The Dutch are not easing restrictions for people travelling from the UK or Sweden (to paraphrase Mark Rutte: We don't want you here) but I can't find anything official from the German government saying anything even close to that.
"Sorry, yes I am! I was thinking of the comment by the German minister warning against travel to the UK and wondered if that would impact whether they'd welcome UK citizens in return."
"The UK will require everyone to go into a 14-days quarantine from Monday on, that’s why the German government will keep up a travel warning for the UK. https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/0…"
"What I would say about the 14 day quarantine is that it is incredibly unpopular in the U.K. and not expected to last very long.There seem to be very little Scientific evidence that asking people to isolate from countries where infection rates are low will do much if anything to further reduce the current infection rate in the U.K.Also the quarantine itself isn’t really a quarantine. People arriving can still take public transport to their final destination which could potentially be at the other end of the country.Once at the destination there is only a 20% chance you will get a visit from a Border control official. The quarantine is due to be reviewed towards the end of June and most people tend to think that the restrictions will then be relaxed for Countries with low infection rates.Edited: 6:44 pm, June 04, 2020 "
"The quarantine is unpopular with the travel business. Maybe not so with the general population.However, as at the moment, today's figures she that the UK currently has 10% of the whole world deaths from Covid. Shameful, for a country in the top 5 or 6 richest countries in the world.Reallly, why would any country let anyone from the UK enter, as things stand?"
