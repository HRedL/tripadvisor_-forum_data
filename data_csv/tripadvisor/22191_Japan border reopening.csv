"Hello,I was wondering if anybody have some insider knowledge of Japan, about the timeline of allowing foreign tourists? I had a trip rescheduled from May this year to October so I'm hoping I would be able to make it. There aren't many official info that I could find so any help would be appreciated.Thank you, stay safe!"
Everything depends on below.https:/…countries
"No insiders here. Actually, even the insiders don't know."
"""Immigration authorities quietly published criteria that will allow some foreign residents to re-enter Japan despite a coronavirus-induced entry ban covering 111 countries . . .""http://www.moj.go.jp/content/001321982.pdfFrom the news today - the authorities are doing things ""quietly"" knowing they have messed up.As for general tourists or visitors - the MOFA page will get updated by the end of the month."
"At the end of the month, they will start with business people with Vietnam."
"No ""tourists."" Just business and work. Latest news says the travelers need to test negative for PCR before getting on the plane. This article is a few days old. https:/….Xua4gy17HsEDon't hold your breath for opening borders to tourists."
"The Japanese Government won't allow European tourists to come in until the COVID-19 infection decrease in Europe. They will start allowing business people to come from Vietnam at the end of this month, but few Vietnamese will wish to come until the infection become rare in Japan as in Vietnam. Actually, the incidence of the infection in both countries(Japan and the foreign country) might have to be similar for the foreigners to come to Japan."
Donat G is asking for October. Gradually it will open up so we have to wait and see.
"Indeed, everyone on this board is just guessing. Most of us agree that they likely will allow Southeast Asia and Oceania visitors first as long as those countries have their numbers under control. Even those folks are unlikely to be allowed all at once. There are many hurdles to clear. The currently expensive health tests could also deter potential non-essential travelers."
"Thank you for the replies. Who knows what will happen until October. I just hope they will make the criteria for each country separately and not for the EU as a whole, because Croatia has much lower rate of COVID-19 infections than the rest of the European Union. Of course, even if they allow tourists, Japan would need to discard mandatory quarantine.I guess we will just need to wait."
"They will only allow tourists who can deal with the mandatory quarantine.Put off your trip if you cannot deal with it.Edited: 1:14 am, June 15, 2020 "
You mean quarantining for 14 days when you arrive in Japan?
"Yes, that's right. The incubation period is said to be 14 days so it's done that way even who tested negative now.https:/…page4e_001053.htmlThere are some research after the fifth day you got infectious, one won't spread to others, so if that would be proved, it might become shorter."
"Me and my Fiancee also wanted to move our wedding from April to October and honeymoon in Japan in October for halloween events. We're basically doing a plan, so we're ready to book, but arent actively booking anything until we know what's happening. We've decided to wait until Mid-End of August and then see how things are by then. Since we'd only be going for about 14 days we obviously dont want to be Quaranteened for the whole trip. We're basically taking it every two months. If its not looking likely by August, we'll wait until October and plan for December, if not then, look at it in December and plan for Jan/Feb, etc. Until we can go without restrictions.Considering right now MOST places in the world have banned incoming flights, and then have a 14 day quaratine, we're not holding our breath honestly."
Well it might be hard from the UK this year considering the high numbers.
