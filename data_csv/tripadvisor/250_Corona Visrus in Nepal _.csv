"Good afternoon,in about 4 weeks my Nepal trip is suposed to start, this makes me very happy.I want to ask if something is known about CORONA VIRUS, soming from China to . . . ?Nepal has a border with China [Tibet] and this border is still open? This makes me nervous.For all the news, anyeay if bad or good news I am thanksfully.Toni S."
Hi TonyUnfortunately the Corona Virus has already arrived in Nepal and if it is as contagious as reported will spread rapidly through the population as there is only limited healthcare available and no infrastructure to contain it. EricMy Nepal Pages https://wanderingeric.org/category/nepal/
Here is the latest situation report from the World Health Organisation with only one case in Nepal and you are coming from USA which has 5 cases. If you are unconcerned in your home country it should be for Nepal as well apart from Nepal health facilities being less capable if an outbreak does occur https:/…The odds are you will survive as you are unlikely to get it however read the WHO site on precautions here https:/…advice-for-publicThe Nepal border with China has only mostly several road freight transport and does not get large numbers of the Chinese population free flowing so there is not the problem you think. The majority of 134000 annual average Chinese tourists arrive by plane and the overall number is not so large.
"Thank you very much for your responses and your advises. I'm now very much afraid and I don't know what to do ???Yes, I know the traffic from China / Tibet to Nepal is mostly for trucks which bring goods from one country to the otherone, and not so many tourist doming.-In my case I'll fly from Prague / Czech Republic to KTM, with a stopover in Doha for a few hours. In Doha I'm not planing to go outside the airport, I've only 10 hours time till my connection flight to KTM.Oh, my goodness, what can I do now?Edited: 2:31 am, January 28, 2020 "
"Hey Toni,Greetings from a former Alaskan from Haines. :)I spend half the year in Nepal and host dozens of travelers every season. I'm watching this unfold very carefully. Nepal has no way to respond to even a small outbreak. Infectious diseases have been known to rapidly impact tens of thousands of people in short order. Only dumb luck quells outbreaks in Nepal.Currently Nepal has some testing capabilities and just today announced special precautions for Chinese tourists arriving by road and air. Now, that doesn't mean much to me. What Nepal says, and what Nepal actually does is shockingly divergent. I think it's all just positive headline fodder issued by the Tourism Minister, whom I think is a giant idiot. I too am scheduled to arrive in a month, as well as my 30+ clients. For me the next two weeks will be telling. As soon as there are even a few dozen confirmed cases in Nepal, that will spell the beginning of the end. Last season Dengue Fever hit Nepal for the first time and caught 10,000 people on the back foot. The only thing to stop that outbreak....fall weather. And that's my concern. May and June usually see increases in flu and other illnesses. This is really an all or nothing proposition for Nepal. Unlike the US, that can isolate and contain these things, in Nepal, every illness is a runaway train. I would make sure you have good travel insurance. Chances are, we'll all be fine and have a great visit to Nepal, but what happens in the next 2-3 weeks will set the stage."
"I will also add, the problem in Nepal is not just with limited medical resources, which is severe, it has to do with Nepali people. They don't understand infectious disease....AT ALL. I commonly see people who are horribly sick, mingling and coughing all over their kids, family, and anyone around. There is a primitive awareness of illness in Nepal that allows diseases to spread so rapidly. We work with a team of doctors in western Nepal and this is their big challenge."
"Corona virus is a bad cold, deadly to very young, old and weak. IF you are none of those then do not be concernd to a great extent that it changes your trip"
"""deadly to very young, old and weak ""We don't know this yet... don't yet know the real statistics of novel corona virus 2019-nCoV"
"Hi Toni, I leave in a week’s time to go trekking in Nepal and am taking the perspective that the current situation re this virus is not serious enough to warrant any change of plans. Having said that, I have checked my travel insurance again to ensure my cover is appropriate should I be affected and I’ve added a couple of good quality face masks in case I need them. As post #2 says, the risks aren’t inordinately high currently. Risk management isn’t 100% foolproof but it may help you feel a little more confident than your present concerns. Cheers"
Directive issued to to arrange a separate checking facility aircraft flying from China.https:/…
Hi allI notice that British Airways has just suspended all flights to China. Maybe this is a little more serious than the common cold. Eric
This may not be as effective as it should be if other airlines are still flying in from China. All travel should be suspended.
"We just have to keep watching the WHO and other updates, current infections as of todays statement is about 4593 cases, 106 deaths, 50 odd outside of China. Some media sources saying 8500 cases and 130 deaths, so the death rate appears to be about 1.5 to 3%. The elderly and young/ infants often suffer more with such scenarios. The peripheral countries to China with 50 cases is far less and the current risk should be interpreted so.Learning from the last 2003 onwards SARS virus it was 8500 cases with about 9% overall death rate and about 50% among elderly and young/infants, which by comparison to Corona much more deadly. We all lived through that and mostly forget what all the fuss was about. Hopefully it will be similar.Putting it into context to global flu and respiratory diseases there are about 650,000 deaths annually https:/…The 1910 Spanish flu took 50,000,000 globally but 100 years ago different era, today with modern health care and prevention has much better chance.Over on the China travel forum its gridlock panic in places."
"Latest WHO figures 7818 confirmed cases, 170 deaths, 82 outside China, so about 2% death rate, 1% of cases outside China. https:/…novel-coronavirus-2019"
I hope February is still okay - I would be more worried of travelling to Nepal Mid March or later. I'm pretty sure it will spread worldwide - it's too contagious to be contained in Africa or countries like Nepal. But it took like 1 months in Wuhan from first cases (8. December) until the health system started collapsing (10. January according to quite a few sources hospitals started getting problems). Problem is more to get a flight back once the situation explodes....I am pretty sure that 90% of infections in Wuhan are not registered / people did not go to hospitals after Mid January and for a cold you don't go anyhow. I would guess if it arrives in Nepal - from first spread to say 10 people - it will take 2-4 weeks until situation gets out of control. I don't see country by country getting closed out from air traffic. Either worldwide air traffic gets suspended (except for evacuation back home) or air traffic excet to China will just be kept up.
Im supposed to volunteer in Nepal starting March 2nd as well and stay for about 3 weeks in total. Im worried as well and at a loss of what to do.
For those who say it's only a cold and dangerous to the old.https:/…
"If the infected aged death rate information in this is correct https:/…With China average percentage of people over 60 years being about 12%31500 cases globally, 99% in China638 deaths, only 2 outside China, 500 over age 60 years (80%), 138 under 60 years age (20%)14% death rate among those over 60 years age, much more significant than 2% rate generally quoted for all ages. 0.5% death rate among those below 60 years age, significantly different at 4 times less than previously thought compared to 2% rate generally quoted for all ages. If correct this provides some greater risk assurance for this age group, about 1 in 200 death rate compared to 1 in 50 death rate if you get infected. This will likely be skewed by how good or bad treatment and recovery in a Nepalese hospital would be."
"The picture appears to be more complex than this. The virus has the most devastating effect on those with co-morbidities, compromised lung function (eg asthma) and diabetes are the two conditions I have seen mentioned. These conditions will be more prevalent in older people.One suspects that in a country with both high pollution levels and a high number of cigarette smokers the virus is likely to have a more devastating effect."
"To all: Thank's a lot for all your responses.- Now it's still 32 days to my flight from Europe to KTM. I really don't know what to do - when I cancel my flight I will loose all the money for the ticket I payed already. - I think I'll wait little bit longer for some more new's?Thank's a lot . . .Edited: 11:04 am, February 07, 2020 "
"Fake News from TAAN, would be funny under other circontances ...( https:/… )"
"I'm still planning to go unless calamity hits. It's not there atm, and it hasn't taken hold anywhere else yet, maybe a little to much doom and gloom on this forum in regards to it. It's cold in Wuhan now, hopefully it's a cold virus , and as the weather warms it drops away. It should of spread like wildfire in other parts of the world by now, but it's mostly people coming from Wuhan. I'm cautiously optimistic, less so when I read this forum. We'll wait and see"
"I am not (in any sense) a medic. I well understand the comment in post 21 about there possibly being too much gloom and doom. As an aside, if people only read certain posters, it would be a wonder that anyone ever went to Nepal (scams, pollution, road accidents, altitude sickness, unsafe water/food, bad weather etc etc etc). One observation/question: if the virus spreads outside China in a significant way (so far the number of such cases seems to be very limited, though this may be changing...), would Nepal and the main trekking areas, be significantly more dangerous than staying in one's hometown? I ask because every week I am in London, usually 2-3 times, for work. London is incredibly international, and we deal with people from overseas. For example yesterday I 'met', at a distance (followed up by phone), a Chinese property developer who had just returned from southern China - no checks at all on his arrival in the UK... Unless somewhere like London is shut down, with the number of people and how busy public transport is, presumably huge numbers would be quickly exposed to the virus. Obviously developed countries have much more in the way of health resources than somewhere like Nepal, but my impression is that if there is a major outbreak, the health system just about anywhere will be overwhelmed."
"@22 The real challenge with Nepal and viruses has everything to do with a lack of resources, and an appalling lack of resolve. That's not to say they don't know how to leverage positive headlines. I spend my fare share of time in remote Nepali hospitals and working with small health posts. Even the major hospitals lack the tools needed to test, treat, and quarantine. The most complex issue is simply a matter of culture and communicable disease. In London, or most of the US, households only have 2-4 people. In the US and Australia, there's simply a lot of space between people. In Kathmandu, people are stacked on top of each other...literally in some cases in buses and tuktuks. There is also a complete lack of hygiene. We're not sure who has the bar of soap in Nepal this week. It's also common to spit, cough, snort, and basically dispatch disease like a germ canon.For the government's part, saving face means everything to Nepali culture. Rather than endure the shame of saying they are concerned, they would rather say...we're 100% safe, which they have done. One tour operator told me yesterday, ""Nepali people don't get sick like Chinese people."" To your last point, it would take thousands of cases to truly overwhelm the response capabilities in the US or most of Europe. In Nepal it could just be a dozen that does in tens of thousands.Edited: 6:06 am, February 08, 2020 "
"I don't disagree with most of the points in post 23, but if the virus is, or becomes, easily transmittable, then the crowded public transport systems in modern cities by themselves will do a fantastic job of spreading the virus. I understand the UK (and I assume most similar countries) can handle small numbers of affected people in special units, but thousands, let alone tens or hundreds of thousands, will completely overwhelm any system. Having stayed in the non-tourist villages on the two guides I trek with, and another (unrelated) Nepali (14 stays, for 55 nights in total 2011-20), hygiene practices, especially for food preparation, are very much a work in progress. However, I have never had stomach problems in their villages."
"@24 Some of this falls into my field of work. When viral outbreaks hit Nepal, the spread is always accelerated. Even the recent Dengue outbreak a few months ago was accelerated by virtue of ""domestic density"" or simply put, the close proximity of people in one room to get bit by one mozzy.Right now in Karnali, an outbreak of viral infection has killed to, and our team members in the area suspect it has effected over 1,000 people. In March of last year, we responded to a viral outbreak that overflowed patients at every hospital and healthpost near Jajarkot. Same again earlier than year in Banke, and again in Banke six months earlier. It's important to also consider, 50% of all Nepali kids are malnourished and imuno-compromised. I've visited more than 300 remote schools and we have seen...four...with hand washing stations. It's a recipe for rapid and lethal spread of communicable pathogens.This is why corona must NEVER get it. There's nothing to stop it. Call that fear mongering if you want, it's also a reality worthy of attention.Edited: 7:53 am, February 08, 2020 "
Hey i am from NEPAL. Till now there is no any such suspect has been found suffer from corona.its safe to visit Nepal.

"It’s understandable that lay persons not involved in or versed in public hygiene, health and sanitation issues both in their home countries and abroad and who dodged illness in their trips may view these discussions as too much doom and gloom. While those who work in the field might appear too alarmed. Often many people need to have a significant negative life experience and often enough until it sinks in to form a lasting change in outlook, even though the visual cues from what their eyes, noses and logic should be telling them should be very logical or is it a case of eyes wide shut.Nepal and in fact most of the entire developing world and particularly the Indian subcontinent experience all manner of public health and sanitation problems that were mostly resolved 100 years ago in parts of the world with enough resources and proper government. We in developed places forget and take for granted the gains in public health achieved in certain parts of the world over hundreds of years by the modern industrial societies and seem to think that is shared everywhere, when it is certainly not by two thirds of the world population.My line of work in Australia is in environmental health and even in as affluent and developed a place, behind the scenes from public view we deal regularly with infectious disease control, food and sanitation, fetid conditions of overcrowding in low social economic housing and apply the full measure of health laws against recalcitrant members of the public that cause these problems. There are also very vulnerable communities within Australia such as the Aboriginals who live in remote areas with very low quality housing and nutrition conditions similar to the worst of the developing world and it is a great source of shame.At work we deal with lots of people in the public who are totally unaware of such issues but upon explanation they very quickly understand while some do not. Likewise most tourists I have met trekking and travelling with extensively, even though they are not medics or well versed do in fact understand and accept there are issues and try to do something to protect themselves, while a very few don’t get it and are still pondering if it is reality at all. As the saying goes one can only lead a horse to water but not make it drink. Perhaps some view such discussions as doom and gloom probably because it will affect their total decision to travel or trek as they have difficulty balancing the negatives and positives.Edited: 12:48 pm, February 08, 2020 "
Hi allIf anyone even briefly thought that Nepal would step up to the plate during a health emergency check out this story. https://kathmandupost.com/health/2020/02/09/…EricMy Nepal Pages https://wanderingeric.org/category/nepal/
"#29 I can’t see any airport arrival quarantine accepting or needing that if a person is coming from Nepal unless they were resident in China less than 14 days virus incubation time. If it is in fact needed then the test and certificate date should only be as close as possible to departure date, highly unlikely.If the news report is correct it appears to be the lab taking advantage of the situation corruptly from Nepalese travelling abroad.Edited: 5:20 am, February 09, 2020 "
"I think this is about comparative safety - if the virus is or becomes very contagious, is it safer to stay at home, or will the risks be much the same if people travel (in this case to Nepal). If people live in comparatively isolated (ie less visited) rural areas in developed countries, presumably it is safer to stay put.However if they live in or near major urban centres, the risks of travelling are presumably not that different to the risks of staying put. As above, in any major, modern, urban centre, the sheer number of people and the range of places (internationally) they are going to and coming from, the densities of use of public transport and public spaces, means that the virus would, presumably, spread very fast. I have little (no) faith in the honesty or ability of the Nepali authorities, (one of the benefits of knowing some Nepalis very well is that one becomes much more aware of the realities of how things work out there, in a political sense). However the Chinese authorities don't exactly seem to have handled the early stages of the outbreak well, and as one of my posts above, a person flew direct from China (PRC) to the UK this week, without any checks at all, which raises question about the UK authorities abilities and motives (not to upset the PRC government?)."
"Taking the comparative risks as outlined in 32 at face value, I know where I would want to be if I did contract it and it's not Nepal.scoodly"
"If there is currently no cure for the virus, and 'treatment' consists principally of helping people's immune systems fight off the virus (or not), and with western health systems likely to be overwhelmed if there is a big outbreak (annual flu stretches the UK health system), how much real difference will the location make, if someone gets the virus. The local health systems in China appear to be more than stretched. This is probably something best addressed by those with real understanding of these things, so it would be interesting to hear from a such person/s."

"It would make a great deal difference where one is 'treated'.Taking the analysis of risk of infection as similar in the UK and Nepal at face value: then there is a comparison of health systems. If the somewhere like the UK helath care syatems would be overwhelmed then Nepal's would be to a much greater extent - and it would take nothing like the numbers in China to get to that point.As for the quality and access to care there is a world of differtence even if there is no cure. Travellers, assuming insurance does cover this outbreak - check policies carefully, would get better care than locals who (mostly) could not afford treatment in the better hospitals but i would still rather be in the UK than at, as examples, CIWEC and TUTH (both of which I have experience of).But here's a simple question for others: where would you rather be if you contracted this virus, in hosptal at home or in Nepal?I am not a doom and gloom monger about travelling to Nepal at this time (though I would consider it carefully) nor do I ignore the diffences between the UK and Nepal and it does not take, for example, medical professionals to inform me of this (though not to be ignored).scoodlyEdited: 7:21 am, February 09, 2020 "
"@33 I think you miss the larger issue. Western countries not only have a better support system to detect, treat, and isolate cases of the virus, the basic culture of daily life has proven to slow the rate of spread. Again, population density isn't the only factor. Facilities in Nepal are 40 years behind the West, and that's being generous.I'm with Scoodly. The cause for concern is if this virus ever gets in the door in Nepal. Whereas the West can beat it back quite well, there's nothing to stop it in Nepal. Think of it like a match to a hay stack. In the West, we can get appropriate care in minutes. In Nepal? Forget it. I would take Japan as an example. With the cruise ships folded in, they have more than 40 cases, but the threat to the nation is assessed as minimal. That many cases in Nepal, with nothing to abate the spread, would become thousands by week's end.Again, how do we know? Because outbreaks are common in Nepal. Like those going on now in Karnali."
"#31 there might be some forewarning in terms of comparative safety in terms of any new diseases coming from outside Nepal presumably spreading from unscreened quarantine airport arrivals, spreading in cities and then to countryside. Though less likely the nCorvirus might also enter from China to Nepal overland on the several truck freight and trade routes. In which case trek routes like Langtang and Namche via Tibetan traders might cause the spread in the reverse direction starting from trekking areas and places in eastern Nepal borders. The movement of people across the borders are very leaky and that is also a source of potential virus entry.A Trekker still needs to run the gauntlet in the infected cities upon airport arrival and departure so one is potentially still at risk.Given that trekking area lodge food and water sanitation are not good and general high rates of colds and coughs are common the conditions are ripe for spread of the virus. In such a case the health authorities would be focused in the wrong direction and the problem would be upon them without notice.In terms of food preparation a typical trekking lodge kitchen doesn’t even have a proper separate hand washing sink to attempt to reduce infections to customers so any instructions entrusted to the guide to guarantee proper customer safety couldn’t even be carried out as one of the health authority precautions is to wash hands.Edited: 11:29 pm, February 09, 2020 "
"Why are people so afraid from the corona virus ?When I read about it, sounds like a normal flu for regular heathy individuals, unless you have weak immune system or heart problems I am not sure what the issues is.The symptoms of most coronaviruses are similar to any other upper respiratory infection, including runny nose, coughing, sore throat, and sometimes a fever. In most cases, you won't know whether you have a coronavirus or a different cold-causing virus, such as rhinovirus.https://www.webmd.com/lung/coronavirus#2"
"Post 38: good to get some wider perspective, but we do live in the age of fear (or in the west we do). I write this from the UK, where we have had several years of Brexit fear mongering (off topic) and now the corona virus, which may mutate, but currently seems to be equivalent to flu (which itself varies). My 2 questions about corona and travelling were:Are the risks (probabilities) greater than staying home, especially for those who live or work in big cities in the developed countries. One person coughing on a crowded tube train will do lots of spreading.Is there a cure for the virus - I understand that there is not. 'Treatment' seems to consist of supporting people's immune systems, which either fights off the virus (in most cases), or not... The main response seems to be isolation, which is to (hopefully) protect others. If Nepali customs are so favourable to viruses etc, why haven't tourists got sick in large numbers in previous viral outbreaks? As for ""Whereas the West can beat it back quite well, there's nothing to stop it in Nepal"", the Chinese authorities' only effective response seems to be isolation, some of it enforced in a very heavy handed way. If there is a major spread in the west, and with no cure, is it likely that the west will preform a lot better than China?"
"@38 We have an epidemiologist on the advisory board of the nonprofit organization I founded in Nepal. His assessment, as it relates to Nepal, has to do with the unusually high infection rate of corona. It's a numbers issue. While most flu strains kill tens of thousands of people, it infects hundreds of millions and the mortality rate is rather low. Coronavirus has doubled the mortality rate in just 16 days. While the mortality rate is low, it's multiples higher than the average flu and it has potential to get much, much worse. With regard to Nepal, keep in mind, 50% of all children are under nourished. Health resources are beyond primitive. Have you ever seen a remote health post in Nepal? They're like big walk-in first aid kit at best. As our adviser said, the 3% mortality rate in China, could easily become a 20% mortality rate in an undeveloped country like Nepal. Our adviser also said, with 900 deaths reported, it's unlikely all of those patients were old, young, weak, or compromised. Statistically."
"Thanks Quitou for responding as someone with a real understanding of these issues.One of the differences I see between Nepal and the UK in terms of the spread is Nepalis do not have access to free health care so might not be able to afford so not seek care and be in the community. With free health care (at the point of delivery this is much less likely to be the case in the UK.Another issue is the chance of spread in hospital. As an example, on a ward in TUTH there was no water in the toilets. I asked to used the medics toilet and was allowed (foreigner privilege no doubt) there was water but no soap or towels - appalling. As a teaching hospital TUTH is probably one of the best funded government hospital in Nepal. I shudder to think what others are like. As for treatment and care, a one sentence description does not cover it. Even as a lay person, a quick read of the WHO guidance gives concern about Nepal's capabilities and convinces me (if needed) that in the event of an infection I would prefer to be in a UK hospital.I had an email exchange with an insurance company I have used in the past and a spoke with the one I used for my trip in January. The former was equivocal: underwriters may approve a claim now but may declare it a pandemic which is not covered. The latter stated coronavirus claims were not covered. Check carefully. Again, no intention to scaremonger.scoodlyEdited: 6:29 am, February 10, 2020 "
"@39 I realise that Nepal will have a higher mortality rate due to being a poorer country as a whole, I was talking mainly for tourists like me who come from UK or any other developed country. Why would people cancel their plans or holiday for a flu like virus that's dangerous to the 2-3% of the population, it just seems a bit too much overreacting to me personally.I might of course be wrong and It might be a lot more dangerous but just from what I have read doesn't seem like a major problem."
"I do agree that the media in many cases is making nCoronavirus more alarming than it needs to be.Here’s what we currently know of nCoronavirus and one doesn’t need to be an epidemiologist, it’s just simple level maths. I’ve done done several epidemiology units in my studies but I don’t need to apply fancy bio stats for this and this is why all the health authorities with their armies of epidemiologists around the world are worried. Currently 40,200 official nCoronavirus cases, 901 deaths = 1 in 44 chance of death across all ages or 2.2% death rate. Current season flu in the US has 20 million cases with 10,000 deaths = 1 in 2000 chance of death. Comparing the two, nCoronavirus is 45 times more deadly than flu across all ages. However, the odds are that a person will survive nCoronavirus if you are a healthy person.99% of nCoronavirus cases are currently in China and 80% of deaths are for those over 60 years age who generally have more underlying health issues. China’s percentage of people in this age bracket is about 12% so of the 40,200 cases there are likely to be 4824 people in this age bracket. 923 total deaths so far means about 738 people in that age bracket = about 1 in 6 chance of death or 15% death rate very high.This is based on Chinese people, who roughly have similar health and life expectancy to that of those in the USA. In less developed countries with lower health and life expectancy the death rate would surely be higher.If the above figures are correct, conversely for those below 60 years age the death rate is much less than the currently reported nCoronavirus 2.2%. It comes out at around 0.5% or 1 in 200 death rate, which is still well above flu of 1 in 2000 or 10 times more lethal.In summary the across all ages the death rate comparison is nCoronavirus 2.2% vs flu 0.05% or 44 times. If nCorona virus spreads like some flu have in the past to 20% of the world or let’s say just to China’s population there could be 280 million cases and 6 million deaths.Also, note since nCoronavirus official cases came to be officially reported on 20 January there was about 300 cases in only 20 days it is now 40,200 cases, in another month it could be around 3-5 million cases currently growing between 10-20% daily. If left unchecked in the month at 2.2% death rate that could be around 60-100,000 deaths and that in itself is only 2 months on and we still have about until June for this to play out."
"It is premature to postulate the case fatality ratios or characterize whether the media is being alarmist or not. There is a lot that is not known as yet.

"Here is some more detail on those comments from Zhong Nanshan, the Chinese government’s senior medical adviser.In an interview with Reuters, the 83-year-old epidemiologist who won fame for combating the SARS epidemic in 2003, said the coronavirus outbreak was hitting a peak in China and may be over by April.He said a forecast based on mathematical modelling, recent events and government action suggested the peak should come in middle or late February, followed by a plateau and decrease.“I hope this outbreak or this event may be over in something like April,” he said in a hospital run by Guangzhou Medical University, where 11 coronavirus patients were being treated.“We don’t know why it’s so contagious, so that’s a big problem,” added Zhong, whose previous forecast of an earlier peak turned out to be premature. He said there was a gradual reduction in new cases in the southern province of Guangdong where he was, and also in Zhejiang and elsewhere."
"#48 that’s good if the decline of infections going to be as predicted.As to why it is more infectious there is some recent information from China believing it’s not only spread in large water droplets from sneezes and coughs at 1-2m range where it settles out but it is possibly aerosolised meaning the virus is transmitted in smaller airborne droplets of water suspended in the air for longer and travelling further and increasing infection opportunities.This combined with people shedding the virus before they appear or feel ill gives it unique abilities to spread. With the aerosolisation factor it’s likely to mean that due to being carried in smaller droplets there is possibly less concentration of virus particles needed to infect someone, which is a third factor. This is how influenza virus behave as well and manage to spread rapidly.These virus adaptations are not great for overcrowded, unventilated housing and public transport conditions combined with lack of hygiene practices"
"The latest twist - Nepal's human rights council, itself a joke, pressured the gov to evacuate 180 people from Wuhan. Rather than heed the mandate of the W.H.O. to quarantine them far from large populations of people, Nepal, in their infinite wisdom, has chosen to place all 180 people in four facilities within the most densely populated valley in the entire country. And, the facilities are clearly not to W.H.O. standards. And, the regional hospitals have all said they lack the resources to treat more than a few critically ill patients. Maybe as few as 11, all without the ability to contain the virus in the hosptial.I have a meeting with the Minister of Tourism in two weeks. Maybe. Much could change in two weeks."
"Corruption and incompetence, plus denial (in its various forms) are not, in any way, unique to Nepal. As above, the response of the Chinese authorities seems to have left a lot to be desired (British understatement), and the UK government (last week) was letting in people coming directly from China (PRC) without any checks. I do have some direct experience of Nepali health facilities: I have been several times in the 'health' facility in my guides' village (Rasuwa district) - it is in a large, impressive looking building that has almost nothing in it, including no doctor. Interestingly, the (much poorer) village of the other Nepali I know well (which is in eastern Kavre) has smaller, but excellent, and amazingly hygienic facilities - a huge contrast. I went several times (early 2018) to a Ktm hospital - the younger guide had a very bad chest type infection (intravenous antibiotics) - hygiene was dreadful, effectively non-existent (we brought in stuff for him, and ran the test results past a UK doctor who has extensive experience in Nepal, since the 1980s). BTW what is the source of your claim that 50% of Nepali kids are malnourished. Experts (proper ones) were saying on the BBC this morning (radio) that it now appears that the corona virus can be spread by breathing, not just by sneezing etc - obvious implications for transmission in modern cities. NB mentioning 'treatment' is a bit misleading - it is mainly isolation and supporting the immune system - as I understand it, currently there is no direct treatment of the virus."
"""NB mentioning 'treatment' is a bit misleading - it is mainly isolation and supporting the immune system - as I understand it, currently there is no direct treatment of the virus.""Treatment is not misleading at all - read the WHO information about early supportive therapy (synonymous with treatment). ""Supporting the immune system"" includes using antibiotics where appropriate which WHO advises, among other things. This is treatment but not a direct attempt to treat the virus or cure it (no such claim made by me).scoodly"
"@recomments, the statistics on child nutrition and development are consistent when reported by UNICEF, USAID, etc. The ""national"" score for malnourished kids is really closer to 45%. But in 10% of the areas my organization visits, the degree of malnutrition is qualified as ""critical"" to ""severe"" meaning it will likely produce lifelong damage or developmental disabilities.And most hospitals in rural areas are either vacant or do not have doctors. That was just in the Himalayan Times today regarding the hospital in Jajarkot, a hospital I know well and visit often. Back to kids, illness, and treatment. It's rather common for me to meet kids in the spring, return after monsoons, and find they did not survive the season. This due to simple things like basic and even mild gastritus. Unleash something like corona in Nepal and it will make the devastation of 2015 seem manageable. By the way, there are currently two large scale viral outbreaks in Nepal right now. Untreated."
"“Aerosolization” of Corona virus in a previous comment meant it is airborne or more effectively carried in the air and for longer time period to be breathed in. While sneezing and coughing sprays out larger droplets of moisture but about 1-2m range.If you are sneezed or coughed on or within that range the droplets can still be breathed in and the spray droplets land on you and surfaces to be transferred to entry points into your body via mouth, nose and eyes. So washing hands helps to limit that transfer and masks reduce being breathed in.It has always been known by experts and well taught among all the medics and various allied health professionals that the common cold and flu can be transferred to people in all of the above ways but more often in the sneeze and cough range. What the experts are saying for Corona virus or the new name COVID-19 is that it has special ability among some other forms of similar virus to become particularly airborne and breathed in."
A UN article on malnutrition in the developing world with 1 in 3 children globally being under nourished https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/10/1049261What can seem quite misleading to the lay person including highly experienced trekkers and visitors is that the outward appearance of what is a healthy person or child does not translate to preconceptions of obviously healthy or unhealthy individuals standing right there before you. A malnourished child can be carrying body fat appearing healthy but is not.
"Yesterday Evening i heard rumours about an hotel infected and people running away when they wanted to quarantine it. Not looking good. Besides like 1/3 people in Kathmandu are coughing anyhow all the time. that plus no hygiene, I'm afraid I cannot make my flight back in 3 weeks."
"""‘Preparation to quarantine evacuees complete’Or maybe not:https:/…scoodly"
"#56 ""Yesterday Evening i heard rumours about an hotel infected and people running away when they wanted to quarantine it. Not looking good.""Excellent reporting. Yesterday evening in Khumbu I heard rumors that the Yeti had caught the virus in Tibet after a shopping trip over Nangpa La. He sneezed on a yak that later got in a shuffle with a donkey train that a Belgian trekker petted before boarding the KTM flight out of Lukla. Not looking good."
so kind of you KarlEdvard to post the most reliable up to date informationI wonder if the traumatised donkey train could be evacuated on a scam helicopter and charge it to the Yeti insurance companyI have just contacted my discount budget third party booking agency and asked if I can cancel my trip to Belgium as the flu is sure to spread quickly around a small country that you could sneeze from one end to the other
Well I personally met people who saw that scene. The only thing rumour about it is that it was because of Corona Virus.
"Post 61: ""Associated with over coming fear"" - it seems like some people will have a lot of chanting to do."
Pity the Dalai Lama doesn't have faith in the efficacy of the mantra in the real world (he's cancelled all his engagements).It's good and fine to have faith but it would be nice if all these leaders were as if not more vigorously promoting advice on hand washing.
"Namaste Betty,unlike Religion as such, Buddhism is more a scientific investigation of the mind with yoga and some ritual thrown in. If most of the punters in the crowd do not practice the yoga of reciting the mantra then not much any other individual can do. As mentioned in my post...it s up to you’... being the individual must practice rather than expect another to save them. In regards to Tara, a female deity, the term Namaste translates as ‘ I recognise the divine within you’. Thus the recitation of the mantra connects the individual with that aspect of their own divinity as means of healing and protection.Buddhism has very little to do with faith but a lot to do with practice and reason.As to the real world, what are you suggesting regarding the Dalai Lama and his positive influence around ‘the world’ .I dare say Indian officials etc would have had something to do with the cancellations as well. Hysteria in the crowd is rife....just read all the post here!Stories from Australia include a man of Chinese descent dying in the street of a heart attack as no one would go near him for fear of the virus.....thinking he had the virus simply because he seemed to look of Chinese Heritage.As to hand washing....I always travel with hand sanitizer....stands to reason....but the this virus is airborne is it not!"
HiI probably shouldn't have responded earlier but it worries me when we lose sight of the science.Handwashing/sanitising is critical in reducing transmission of the virus. This is one of most important messages that we need to take on board (clearly alongside all the other related advice e.g. sneezing?coughing into something rather than the air)Nil to add
"Seems like your suggesting I or Buddhist meditation masters have ....’lost sight of the science’. Living in Australia the science and experience of climate change have a direct impact on me daily at the moment.I teach STEAM being science, technology, engineering, art and maths, from the prospective of kitchen gardening.A major in comparative religious studies and history of religion at uni underlined the nature of Buddhism as a practical and in-depth science of the mind, meditation and experience being the microscope.Despite the above, numerous trips into the Himalaya has exposed me to a number of events I cannot easily explain to another unless they witnessed it too. Even then, individual interpretations of the same event never quite match."
"A new update from Ktm Post with some info on what's going on in Nepal WRT the Coronavirus and the one confirmed case... No indications of spreading (yet), but worth mentioning what the confirmed case said: “Ever since I was discharged, I have been meeting family members, friends and neighbours,”Nepal may need lots of Karma to get thru this one!https://kathmandupost.com/health/2020/01/31/…"
"@67 That post is a little old. In the last two days, two Nepali nationals, and one Chinese visitor, were admitted into the main diagnostic hospital for testing. The test results have not been announced, and seem overdue. The real bummer is a Saudi man who went to the hospital complaining of Cov-19 symptoms. He was tested, but left despite the hospital having legal authority, and moral responsibility, to detain him. He's on the loose.The borders remain open to Chinese visitors, with virtually no screening. At the Indian border in Nepalgunj there is a ""Health Desk"" tasked with screening for COV-19, but they not only don't have the tools to do so, they don't have any idea what to look for, or what to do if they found it.Lastly, we're still not sure if the government will approve the flight to Wuhan to evacuate 180 Nepali nationals. We do know, the quarantine facilities in place DO NOT meet W.H.O standards, and directly defy recommendations to place these facilities as far from major population centers as possible. Basically, Nepal has fubared this entire thing thus far, and been incredibly lucky. Only luck will save Nepal at this point."
"Quittou, how this can be: "" The borders remain open to Chinese visitors, with virtually no screening."" ???I have read that all the borders to China, including Tibet, are closed? What is the truth now?"
"My understanding is the borders with Tibet are closed (causing food shortage in the far west of Nepal). Quitou refers to the Indian border being open to Chinese visitors with no screening. I have not heard about any of the Indian borders being closed to Chinese visitors and would be very surprised if there was any screening given that the stated screening at TIA is not happening, at least fully.scoodly"
https:/…For what it's worth this is a report in the Himalayan Times today that the three tested negative
Mike T suggests Nepal needs Karma to get through this.Karma is action which has a cause.Quilto suggests Nepal needs luck to get through this.Luck is open to interpretation...not saying that karma is not....but then does luck have a cause? Or is it random?
"Despite the concerns about other border entry points, it would not appear there a lot of China visitors using those points, though it may only take several infected to spread but the risk appears low."
"Today at Boudha StupaChokyi Nyima Rinpoche and the monks of Ka Nying Gompa will be conducting a number of rituals and prayers for those who died from the virus and to decrease the fear and general emotional upset connected to it.From the Buddhist perspective, simply rejoicing that these practices are being conducted adds to their positive intent and bring benefits!"
John C - Can you open your own thread to spread the gospel of Boudha? By polluting this thread - you are giving Boudha and Boudhists a bad name. Could not care less about the Buddhist or any other religious mumbo jumbo on this particular matter..
"Although kavm, you do realise that Kathmandu is arguably the most temple rich and ritualised city in the world and mention of its cultural practice in dealing with this issue is hardly evangelical.That is not suggest an increased awareness of how the illness spreads and control through hygiene is any less useful to the people of Nepal.Edited: 12:41 am, February 15, 2020 "
looks like the tabernacle doesn't like the templemore hand washing please everyone
"It seems that the position with regards to the risks of getting the virus, whether in Nepal or elsewhere, is no clearer, and hence the question of comparative risk (ie being in Nepal versus being elsewhere, except say Wuhan) is no clearer.It is not even that clear as to what the survival rate is for those who become infected. It appears that most of those infected will get a relatively mild illness. There is currently no cure, or vaccine. Most of the stuff in the general media about the likely spread and consequences of the virus includes the key word ""could"" (which is logical, as so much is still not known). However the use of could enables large sections of the media to slant their headlines in a much more dramatic way - bad news and fear always sells. There is a similar situation with a number of the posts under this topic. No one can, at this stage, disprove any of the 'could' based suggestions and extrapolations, other than to point out the lack of balance. Though a totally different situation, exactly the same thing happened with Brexit in the UK (I am in the UK). There were thousands (probably tens of thousands) of dramatic, bad/worst case headlines and 'pronouncements'. Most were presented in such a way as to suggest that the doom foretold would happen (the could aspect being carefully underplayed). This mis-use of could provided a form of cover, though it was usually done in such a way as to not detract from the doom mongering headlines. Here also one could express doubt about what was being said, but it was impossible to go further, let alone disprove most of it, even some of the more extreme nonsense that was put about."
"As yesterday’s New York Times notes, we are hardwired to miscalculate risk:https:/…coronavirus-risk-interpreter.html"
"Post 81: many thanks for the link to the article, which I think is excellent, and which I would encourage people to read."
"@73 This is what we mean when Nepal is not capable of managing this type of scenario, or media messaging. I'm actively working with the NTB on this very thing. To say ""Nepal is in no danger"" creates even more panic and worry. Every country is at risk of exposure. The primary difference is the ability to respond. Even the head of the WHO said their greatest fear is this epidemic spreading to a country with a weak healthcare system. That, means Nepal.I interviewed the Deputy Director of the Himalayan Times, and they agreed their best course of action is not to continue to print ""Nepal is safe"" pieces, but to accurately report on the ACTIONS ongoing, and not the PROMISES and false claims of officials and random people with no experience or authority. Like the NTB and Mr. Bhatarrai, who said ""Nepal is safe"" with nothing to back it up.In 14 days I arrive with two video crews and four journalists. We'll see how prepared Nepal is."
"#81 - Thanks for sharing it. I, however, am as unconvinced by the ‘people overestimating risk and media hype’ crowd as I am by the ‘it is a pandemic’ crowd. The fact is that we do not know enough to know which is closer to the truth. It is considerably harder to estimate the growth as well as mortality rate at this stage. The NY Times article I shared in #44 is much more credible to the extent it points out what we do not know and is written by an epidemiologist engaged with this situation, whereas the #81 article is somewhat timeless observation about the irrationality in the human risk estimation and decision making. The two key issues are reproduction factor and mortality rate - and neither is totally clear. Sure we have seen one back-of-envelope logic right on this thread, but that’s all it is. The article in #44 points out that Sars virus mortality rate was underestimated due to poor math and the eventual mortality rate came to a much higher number. So, we know a lot but also too little at this stage. On one hand, the virus is largely limited to China and even more localized there. Yet, there remains a chance for it to become a pandemic as well. So, this remains a case of decision making under uncertainty - when the nature of the uncertainty remains, well, uncertain (with incomplete data to characterize it statistically). What is clear is that countries like Nepal are not particularly well placed to to handle it (not to say that more resourceful countries are much better placed). So, stopping the spread at an early stage is quite critical. But, I suspect the intrinsic characteristics of the contagion is perhaps a bigger determinant than the half-hearted efforts reported here.Edited: 10:54 am, February 15, 2020 "
"Post 84: the NYT article linked in post 81 focuses primarily on the perceptions, biases etc and the roots of these, rather than technical stuff about the virus. It therefore helps to explain the highly negative character of both many of the posts under this topic, and the tone and nature of much of the general public discourse, even allowing that media outlets have a product that they need to sell. With much still to be learned about this virus, cold 'logic' would suggest caution in people's views, especially 'forecasts' and 'extrapolations'.Post 73 is almost a mirror of some of the very negative posts, especially the (express or implied) prognoses."
"#85 - Thank you! I understood the NYT article in post 81, and am even familiar with the research of Amos Tversky, left, and Daniel Kahneman referenced there. In fact, here is an interesting New Yorker link to their story - https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/…Speaking only for myself, I am mostly interested in cold logic, as the people's behavior will run the somewhat predictable gamut.Speaking of that - a New Yorker daily comment on Coronavirus and viral pandemic is quite interesting and illuminating:https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment…"

Another NYT article on cognitive biases and the new conoravirus:https:/…coronavirus-fear.html
"Today Nepal evacuated 175 students from Wuhan and transfered them to a quarantine location in Bhaktapur. They're bound to be criticized for defying WHO recommendations to not place a quarantine facility near high densities of people, but that's pretty par for the course for Nepal, stubborn to a fault.It also appears as if the thermal monitors at TIA are correctly put in place, and hopefully staffed properly.As a harsh critic of Nepal's authorities, I am somewhat impressed with the proactive measures as of late. They are not up to Western standards, but seem to rise above the usual kid-like approach to these things in Nepal."

"I'm scheduled to arrive March 21 through Dubai and I'm starting to get nervous as of today. Even if there are no more cases by the time I leave, there could be more cases while I'm there and that could be a nightmare!

"It's sure not looking good for my scheduled departure for KTM through Doha is in 66 days.Given what we (reportedly) know about how the virus is transmitted, it seems like avoiding contact with potentially infected or exposed people is a key personal prevention tactic. Still, one has to ask questions about things like food and lodging. Who was in the beds we will sleep in? Where did they come from? With whom have they come in contact? The same can be asked about who is preparing our food.I am anxiously hopeful, but not optimistic."
"I'm in the same boat as you -- I'm scheduled to leave for Ktm on 19 April, and be in Nepal thru 25 May. I'll be in Dolpo, nice and close to the Chinese border!!I think it would be a risky proposition to be sure, and at this point I've pretty much assumed that my trip will need to be cancelled. It seems to me virtually impossible that Nepal will not become infected with the virus -- and given the health facilities in Nepal, I'd expect it to quickly become epidemic in the country."
"I am scheduled to leave for KTM on 27 March, do Langtang trek. So far I dont think about canceling my trip. I will see, maybe later situation will force me to cancel.

"Putting Coronavirus aside, I read the following list of vaccinations online today. Does anyone really get all these and if so, is there a recommended regimen or pace?The CDC and WHO recommend the following vaccinations for Nepal: hepatitis A, hepatitis B, typhoid, cholera, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, meningitis, polio, measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis), chickenpox, shingles, pneumonia and influenza."
"#100 you need to consult your own doctor based on what valid and current vaccination record you have. Here is a previous post discussion on that https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g29…Personally I would have all of those mentioned with less importance on rabies and shingles and many of those like tetanus, chicken pox , measles and rubella are standard travel and in your country any way."
"Whoa! That's a long list. I hadn't planned on getting any vaccinations but now I'm looking at the CDC recommendations and I may need to visit a travel clinic and see how many of these I really need to worry about. Again, at this point I feel like there's still a good chance I may have to cancel the whole trip depending on Coronavirus. Because 2 weeks from now we could be facing a whole new situation with this virus. So I feel like I'm in limbo."
"As Ali said, most of those we get in the States anyway (unless you're an anti-vaxxer). I live on a farm, so tetinus is always up to date!"
"#102 personally I would still go if in two weeks based on what we currently know of one infection case at present and in that time not likely to go exponential.One worry on the horizon is that countries west in Iran etc have an outbreak and it may enter via the land borders among communities via there regardless of any China visitors. This is likely to take time to spread from that direction possibly months.Edited: 5:57 pm, February 26, 2020 "

The coronavirus situation is still so unknown, and I’m pretty sure that I won’t have the answers I need over the next few weeks. Being a camping trek with full staff, I didn’t want to cancel at the last minute.Unlike most other injuries or heath problems that may occur while trekking, this disease has a very different characteristic... If I’m in Nepal and I bash up my body in a fall, or contract some serious disease, my travel insurance will fly me out to nearby cities (e.g. Bangkok, etc.) for treatment if warranted. So I’m good with that level of risk.But in the case of the coronavirus, evacuation to another country may prove to be entirely impossible due to entry restrictions of the various countries. That could mean that I’m relegated to treatment in Nepal, and trying to obtain respiratory supportive care in the midst of an epidemic in the country. My age doesn’t help either – I’m 62, so at the cusp of old age becoming a big factor. Even if I were to start my trek whilst everything is OK in Nepal (i.e. no confirmed cases), over the 30 days of my trek the situation could completely change. Given Nepal’s poor health infrastructure, an epidemic could occur very quickly.Overall, I really feel that (for me) going to Nepal now seems like a big risk to take. I REALLY hate to say it – I love Nepal, have lived there, and done almost 20 trips -- but just too many unknowns for me to consider taking the trip this spring. I have another trip to Nepal scheduled for the fall, and I’m still optimistic that I will be able to do that one. Certainly over the next few months we’ll learn lots about the virus, and it will be easier to make an informed decision about international travel."
"Hi Mike - You make a lot of good points. There's also the possibility that Nepal just doesn't have the capability yet to test and give accurate numbers about the spread of the virus. The testing capacity even here in the U.S. is very limited from what I understand. So I'm not convinced that we can be reasonably certain that the virus hasn't spread in Nepal esp because they haven't put any restrictions on travelers until this new visa restriction which doesn't even go into effect until next week!It just doesn't seem to be worth the risk. I'd much rather travel without the cloud of corona virus hanging over my head for a whole month. I too hate to postpone but I feel like I don't have a choice. I have to admit I hate the idea of potentially losing my large deposit and paying flight change fees. Ugh!Edited: 12:19 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"Clearly I have no way of knowing -- but it is definitely my assumption that the virus is currently in Nepal, albeit undetected.Lots of reasons that I feel this way: - Several confirmed carriers have been released back into the population: Per a recent article in Nepali Times, several confirmed carriers either walked out of the hospital, or were inadvertently released before their test results came back. I don't know how much karma Nepal has in the bank, but it seems to me pretty unlikely that none of these carriers spread the disease further... - Nepal has continued to allow flights in from affected countries (although there has been a recent announcement to curtail these flights). Per a recent article, 3000 travelers flew to Nepal from China just in the first three weeks of Feb... - Every report and post I've read on the topic has said that screening procedures at TIA were completely ineffective (although to be fair, airport screening only has limited potential effectiveness...) - The virus should be able to spread thru Nepal extremely easily, given the dense population, poor hygiene conditions, poor health facilities, and various cultural norms (e.g. spitting, coughing in the open, etc.) - The disease is virtually impossible to detect and track without appropriate resources ($, staff, test kits), and Nepal is certainly short of all of these. Even here in the US, with presumably lots of resources to apply, it now appears that the virus was spreading in the population for weeks before we detected it...I don't want to be alarmist, and I surely don't mean to offend Nepal, but I want to be realistic..."
"To correct my previous post (I can't figure out how to edit it) -- several ""suspected"" (I think that would be the correct term) carriers have reentered the population (not confirmed cases, as I had written). Here is the relevant passage from the article: ""The two sick Chinese nationals in Pokhara who were asked to stay under surveillance this month went into hiding and could not be traced. A Saudi Arabian tourist who arrived in Nepal via China also ran away from a Kathmandu Hospital where he was being monitored."" (from Nepali times article)SFAIK, there is still only one ""official"" case in Nepal. However, if I remember correctly, that person did reenter the general population before he had recovered (so he was presumably still contagious). I looked for but couldn't find the article about this one, so I'm not positive my recollection is correct."
I too think the virus is already here.I'm currently working in a hospital in Pohkara and I'm not sure what to do.I planned to stay until 27th March.
"Hello EricYou might want to consider the unreported, unaccounted and basically unknown death toll from human activity that pollutes the environment, particularly in China.And that is not taking into account the issue of biodiversity loss that keeps the joint in balance. In Australia we lost over a billion animals to catastrophic bush fires ramped by climate change, as a conservative estimate.Given I have communicated, from Buddhist masters, their advice, you could take that as a heart felt wish from me, that people remain physically and psychologically safe from the issue at hand.So in short, maybe consider the irony in the comment.And Hope that thousands upon thousands of humans are not wiped out in Syria in the next few weeks."
"Tony SI will assume you ment #119 as Eric at # 120 might have a different take on what follows!If this thing is a flu by another name that transfers easily, you could just go and ensure you have a very good medical kit and the ability to hold up in the hills if things get wild. It could prove an amazing journey at a pivotal time.If you are well travelled in particular areas, a certain danger follows like a shadow regardless.If our focus is on our self then we want to protect that and staying home is probably prudent. If we have the good fortune to be free of such a constraint then it is a ‘wide open road’Edited: 5:27 am, March 03, 2020 "
Still nobody have found corona virus and couple of weeks ago one guy habe found virus because he came back from china but now this guy also return back from hospital .otherwhise everything is fake news for corona virus in nepal.offcourse we have to very becarefull about this virus but we are in nepal now and some people from another country and read some fake news and said corona virun in Nepal .we don't know about tomorrow what happen about this corona in nepal but at this moment no more virus .Thank you ..

"HiJust back from a 15 day visit to Nepal, travelling Kathmandu, Chitwan, Pokhara, near Lumle, Bandipur and Kathmandu.Objectively it seems unlikely that Nepal has no cases of coronavirus, as claimed. We could not gauge how busy the place was as we had never visited before and we were visiting in the off season, but we heard plenty of reports that tourist numbers were down.We used masks largely for the pollution in Kathmandu but not otherwise save at the airport on our way home. We washed our hands and used sanitiser a lot and I gave up worrying how this appeared to others. We stayed in decent hotels and were reasonably careful about where we ate and what we ate and drank (no alcohol to boost our immunity). We had a great time, I think we benefited from Boudanath Stoupa (one of my favourite places) being less busy. I can't advise anyone about whether they should go, we stressed quite a lot before hand because we are at the older end of the spectrum. We visited at a time when I think there was probably a good chance of avoiding infection.Face masks were on display a bit more by the end of our stay but not routinely worn ( although the monks at Boudanath largely wore them). Masks are not a magic bullet in any event. The key we understand is to avoid crowded places, wash hands frequently and avoid touching your face at all.Thank you to all who post on this forum. TA continues to provide good useful advice thanks to the generosity of its posters."
"Thanks for the trip report, Betty.A minor point of clarification to post 131: there has been one recorded case in Nepal according to the WHO. scoodly"
"Walked to Durbar square on a side street with only locals, no tourists tonight (more or less straight down from Kathmandu guest house, then right, then continue straight down untill turning left for Durbar square. Long queues in front of all the pharmacies there. Most people wearing masks, many full n95 respirators. Not sure if they are crowded all the evenings because of being cheap/good or if covid-19 is responsible. Scared me a bit, but fly back tomorrow (well not to Italy as planned, as my connection got cancelled)."
"Post 132: the DM link is interesting (for me, at least). I was in Nepal mid Dec 2019 to mid Jan 2020 - I then returned to the UK. I picked up what I thought was the usual respiratory virus (a bad cold), which gradually eased 2-3 weeks after getting back. This was my 11th visit to Nepal, and I usually get a cold and have sinus issues whilst trekking, and am very prone to getting colds in the UK, especially in the winter. The sinus issues have worsened during my last 2 visits (was going to get them looked at, again, at some point this year).I had assumed that I was in Nepal before the coronavirus spread outside China. Reading the DM link does make me wonder if I should get tested. However, if I was exposed (and I may well not have been), will I still have any trace of the virus?"
"Going early April, so monitoring carefully and grateful for any info. Thoughts with the Nepalese who have recently suffered enough natural catastrophes. This sensible advice issued earlier today.. https:/…"
"The owner of the small trekking agency I've used for years reports very disappointing customer stats for this spring (do far): 11 group cancellations, 4 postponements, only 4 groups still planning to go, but all 4 currently considering cancellation..."
"People in Belgium or France, amongst others, wonder whether their countries will be added to Italy in the Nepal black list as the number of cases increase ...There is also the question whether the Middle East airlines that bring most European tourists to Nepal may cancel flights.Note that in Belgium someone cannot personally ask to be tested. Only suspected cases."
"Experts are saying that generally older people have been exposed to some previous form of Coronavirus which is a general term and one cause of normal flu however the current specific strain for Coronavirus Covid-19 is more serious.In addition to older people’s health generally being less able to cope due in part to greater likelihood of underlying health issues, their bodies are reacting violently to Covid-19 strain as previous exposure antibodies exist and a small but significant percentage greater than normal flu are unable to cope and dying. The offical figures are showing as high as 1 in 6 older infected people fatality in the older age group.If correct there was a recent media report from a Wuhan Chinese hospital doctor speaking out online saying the fatality in Wuhan is more around 5% vs commonly believed 2-3% across all ages. Higher Wuhan hospital fatality rates may be an indication of possible higher fatalities in countries with weak health care systems like Nepal.Anyway encouraging news from Quitou in another post saying Nepalese Government is currently responding well taking the right steps to reduce the potential spread."
"If you want the most up to date information you can read my post on the main forum page.I have met with various levels of the government including the Minister of Tourism, Mr. Yogesh Bhattarai, and the new CEO of the Nepal Tourism Board, Dr. Regmi.At the root of it, Nepal is actually responding more appropriately than many countries at this point. I find it very safe here at the immediate time. The people are so proactive, schools are closing, factories sending people home for a few weeks, and all gatherings, even in very remote villages, have been cancelled or limited. I'm currently here for the remainder of the spring. Our trips are still going forward, and our travel clients still coming."
"#142 -- I think the key words in your reply are ""at the immediate time"". While Nepal currently has no OFFICIAL open cases (and one presumably recovered case), my personal view is that it's highly, highly improbable that the virus has not entered the country. Nepal's proximity to both China and India, the large number of flights that have arrived from various infected countries, the several cases where potentially infected people were inadvertently released into the population, the very weak airport screening... Just look at what's going on world-wide with the spread, and draw your own conclusions.Once the virus does set foot in Nepal, it will likely spread quickly, and probably very ""quietly"" at first (as it did here in the USA). The dense population, poor sanitary conditions, very weak health system, and lack of funding will all contribute to a rapid spread thru the population. Long-term visitors need to be prepared for the possibility that during your trek the virus could hit and spread quickly. If this happens, it's possible that you may not be permitted to fly back your home country, or possibly even fly to a nearby country for treatment if needed. I think the situation in Nepal can change very quickly, and travelers need to anticipate and be prepared for this."
"@143 - I don't disagree with your observation.A couple interesting points to know about. There is a countrywide effort to brace for the impact of the virus. When I attended multiple meetings at the Nepal Tourism Board and even when I gave a press conference for the Nepalese media, everyone was maintaining a safe distance, not shaking hands, and half of the staff was working from home. The virus dominates every conversation from high government to rural farmer.Small factories have closed, and even rural villages that NEVER see outsiders are cancelling school, events, and believe it or not...using soap.There is a consensus everywhere that the virus cannot be allowed in. And I'm not entirely sure it has. I spoke with the deputy director of the Civil Aviation office and inbound flights were cut in February by nearly 75%. Every hotel manager I interviewed said virtually 100% of the group Chinese tours scheduled for February were cancelled. Just yesterday there were only seven international flights inbound. Down from 34 some days this time of year.As a huge skeptic of Nepal's government, I'm kind of impressed. They've made plenty of horrible mistakes, but none that exposed them to a greater threat. If anything, their actions have compounded cancellations, but protected the population. And they've just been really lucky.To be frank, I'd rather be here through all of March than Seattle."
"Yes, Nepal may be stepping up its response now, but I'd argue it's a bit too late...Per a recent article in Nepal Times, 10,000 Chinese visitors arrived in Nepal in Jan, and another 3,000 during the first 3 weeks in Feb. Add to that flights that have been coming in from other infected countries... Yes, Nepal did recently (or is about to) shut down these flights, but I'd argue again, very likely too late.You would have a very difficult time convincing me that among all these thousands of arrivals from infected countries -- that NONE of them were infected?? That seems to be consistent with the thinking of our inept President here in the USA, too -- he thought he could keep the virus out by implementing procedures that are much more strict than those that Nepal is undertaking. And we can see how successful we've been, I believe it has showed up in 19 states now, and all experts agree that it's much more widespread than we currently see...Look at how very rich and technologically advanced countries (e.g. Korea) have struggled to deal with the outbreak. Nepal has both hands tied behind its back in this struggle...Edited: 8:17 am, March 07, 2020 "
"I should add -- I don't mean to be down on Nepal (per my previous post). It's great that they are now stepping up, as Quitou points out. We can only hope that it's not too late and Nepal is able to avoid a major epidemic.Edited: 8:33 am, March 07, 2020 "
"I think the important variable has everything to do with inbound travel. There are thousands of inbound flights to the US and Europe daily. Inbound flights to Nepal were at a near standstill by Feb 5th.In that 30 day time, a well publicized outbreak of viral flu near Dolpo has come and gone. I contacted seven hospitals, or rather my assistant did. Nothing, and given the leaks of Nepal's big mistakes made, it's unlikely reports of corona are being concealed. Again, I see loads of misteps, but I genuinely think Nepal dodged a bullet in February. How that shapes March has me surprisingly optimistic, but I agree, the other shoe could drop soon.I also had a meeting with the deputy editor of the Himalayan Times, and they have three journalists tasked to corona and I'm impressed with their efficacy and restraint. They're producing reliable news. Unfortunately, my contacts at the NTB are leaking incorrect info daily.Things could change rapidly, but thus far, I'm wildly impressed by the state of affairs."
"This THT news report is worrying: ""Govt not to seek details of Spanish national who succumbed to COVID-19""...the Spanish authorities confirmed that the man had travelled to Nepal, the Spanish government would itself send the details of the man to the Government of Nepal even if the government did not make any request for the same...Nepal’s health ministry had not yet made any such requestshttps:/… Any death linked to Nepal, and both Spanish and Nepalese authorities (both working hard to mitigate COVID19) would want to share details to check for contagion that could have followed his journey in either country. Maybe I'm misreading?"
"Mike’s point is well taken. The real issue for those of us that are not in the high risk population is the possibility of being quarantined in Nepal for who knows how long, if we have symptoms. So we could be stuck there. We can’t predict what will happen once we arrive. It’s possible things could escalate quickly! Then we may have to get a physician’s sign off before we can fly back. That’s why I’m planning to get a visa for 60 days just in case. Hehehehe...."

"Post 178: I seriously wonder whether all these restrictions on movement are a waste of time. I can understand restrictions if they slow the spread of the coronavirus, and thus help to spread the resulting additional load on medical resources over a longer time period. Possibly also the hope, and I think it is only a hope, at present, that, in the northern hemisphere, warmer weather will itself stop or slow the virus.However it seems that the virus will spread far and wide. For example the German government has announced that up to 70% of Germans could (that word again) get the virus: https:/…world-us-canada-51835856In London today (in the City, the financial district) there were lots of people out and about, and the trains were very busy - given the lengthy (and it seems variable) incubation period, and the fact that people can be carriers without getting sick and hence realising, and with no cure or vaccine, avoiding restrictions on movement might speed up the whole cycle. Apparently Italy had banned flights from China before the major outbreak (in Italy) - but Italy is currently the worst affected country in Europe. Authoritarian China is apparently claiming to have significantly slowed the virus (or even declared ""victory""), but let's wait and see."
