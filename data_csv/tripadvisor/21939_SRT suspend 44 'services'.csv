"Shows that temperature testing is not that effective as high temperature is only at one stage of the infection, many infected persons are asymptotic and they can spread it as well.Edited: 4:29 am, April 02, 2020 "
"Something isn't right with that story, temp (checked ???) or not, shouldn't have been allowed on the train."

"Hey MrsS ... you here or in OZ ?From the 2nd linked story:""However, he was able to board the train with other passengers since his temperature was recorded at 36 degrees by a railway guard at Bangkok.Nevertheless, the guard had flagged the passenger since he was reportedly suffering from headaches ........and vomiting fits...... before he boarded the train. He was urged by the railway official to rest.""""Mr Anant had been screened at Suvarnabhumi Airport on arrival on Tuesday from Pakistan.""Edited: 6:30 am, April 02, 2020 "
"Been back in Oz since March 1. This guy was not in a good way...leaning on a railing for support while waiting to buy his ticket. Unbelievable that he was allowed to travel. They pulled him off the train at Thap Sakae....so close to home.Edited: 6:53 am, April 02, 2020 "
"Hi,Unbelievable and sad. The Ordinary trains from Bangkok to Kanchanaburi are still running with just 4 or 5 people in each carriage. I wonder when this service will be discontinued. Mrs S, I had planned on going to Ban Krut in April.Edited: 7:55 am, April 02, 2020 "
