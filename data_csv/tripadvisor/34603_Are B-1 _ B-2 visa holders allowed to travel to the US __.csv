"HiI hold a B-1/B-2 visa for the US valid to July 2023 and hold an Indian passport, living in Mumbai.I may need to travel to the US around Oct 15th - my son living in the US is getting married in Oct.As per the information below - it seems I can travel to the US:https:/…from-other-countries.htmlAs per the information below, it seems I can travel only on these specific flights - these are direct Mumbai to Newark flights (non stop):(scroll down to the USA part)https://www.cleartrip.com/travelsafe/…But as per this link below - they list out visas allowed for US entry and B-1/B-2 is NOT among these allowed visas:https://tinyurl.com/y2u69b4zThe USA part says this --->>==========Who are permitted in the US?.......6. Passengers with the following visas: A-1, A-2, C-1, C-1/D, C-2, C-3, D, E-1 (as an employee of TECRO or TECO or the employee’s immediate family members), G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4, IR-4, IH-4, NATO-1 through NATO-4, or NATO-6 visa==========This has led to confusion - can anybody advise how to find out the right information? Obviously, an official US government website is the best source of information.My travel is Oct - so still some time away - but trying to understand whether I can fly at all.....Thx in advance for all the help !"
I don't get your issue. Where have you seen that there are restrictions on travelers from India? As far as I recall India was never (yet) on the list of restricted countries.
I would not rely on a news webpage for official entry policy. A similar thread which may give you some info. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10…
India is not on the restricted USA list as far as I know.
"The safest would be to check with the embassy or consulate. And a lot can change between now and OctoberEdited: 8:50 am, August 10, 2020 "
"Thx all ..... I just called up United Airlines Delhi booking line and they assured me that B-1 / B-2 visa holders are allowed on these flights. They do have many such visa holders travelling daily on their non stop flights to the US - these are non stop flights from DEL to EWR. However, passengers need to go thru 2 weeks quarantine.My travel is in Oct - so hopefully restrictions will be eased further....."
I would not assume they will be eased and in fact they might be tightened. No way to predict
FSR - yes.... I get your point.... just wishful thinking on my part !
