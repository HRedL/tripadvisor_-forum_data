"Is there concern that since Cozumel is a main stop for cruise ships, and these passengers come to Playa del Carmen- There may be the potential for more Coronavirus cases in this area?"
There are already several threads on these forums; you might want to take a peek at one of those:- https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowForum-g150805…- https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g150807…- https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g659488…- https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g150809…
When is your trip? Conditions are going to change over the next couple months. You can find fear mongers or people saying no issue. Just use common sense at the time of your trip. Be sure you have travel and travel health insurance for your trip. I am booked May 2nd and unless American Airlines cancels the flight I am going.
"Cruise boats take this issue very seriously - the issue last week was handled quite well, where health officials visited the Cruise boat moored at Coz to check on the health of people. It was determined is was the regular fluBut you ask a correct concern - just like about your own local airport More tourists travel from the Cancun airport to PDC than Cruise boats from Coz. So it should be statistically LESS - Correct. Florida gets 50 times the cruise boats - so don't travel there as wellEdited: 11:23 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"@Vancouver, call me crazy but I leave March 11th for Miami. I will come back on TA if the airlines are taking any precautions or if the airports are taking any extra precautions. We did nix the idea of a cruise in May and went with a land trip back to Cancun. I don’t want to risk being stuck on a cruise because we all know my cloud black follows me around LOL."

"I definitely wouldn't be on a cruise. After this mornings news about all the cases in Washington that have nothing to do with overseas travel, I think short of sealing up the house and hiding out, we just take our chances. Not cancelling our trip to Mexico."
Thanks so much. My trip is in July. Best
"Agreed. Although cruises have never been of interest- I would not entertain the idea of a cruise today given the Coronavirus. Besides this the GI problems, lack of transparency- just such a solid”no”."
"We are headed to the RM in 6 days, and all I know to do is take my thermometer and ibuprofen with me and make sure I have plenty of prescription medication in the unlikely event we get quarantined. I think the odds are in my favor to be just fine, and my travel insurance was for a one time change, not a ""cancel for any reason"". Fingers crossed!"
Latest info - no Corona virus in the state of QROO
Not reported anyway. Different standards in different countries.
"haha - right - like only 3 possible cases in New York CityEdited: 8:50 pm, March 04, 2020 "
Well we don't know do we. Governor finally said the media is kind of blowing this out of proportion.
"But if someone caught the Virus in MX and brought it back to their own country, it would be well publicized"
I agree with you. Weird thing on national news for the past few days there has been no mention of China.
"We are scheduled to leave on Saturday, March 14. My family is coming from several areas across the US (New Mexico, Texas, Massachusetts, Colorado) and we all have decided to go. Our only concern is the return trip, if the governments close down the ports of entry into the US from Mexico. At this time, I don't see that happening."
"we are the same. 6 families leaving tomorrow and Saturday. So far, Mexico is very low and not on any CDC even LOW risk for COVID. And based on how they are handling Europe...looks like even if they did restrict travel from Mexico, they would let US residents return through specific airports....But again, less cases in all of Mexico than in the entire state of Washington."
"It's not only be able to return to your country but when one does return they might ask you to quarantine for 2 weeks as a precaution before going back to work, school, etc. Things are evolving fast. In Quebec they just said an hour ago that whoever comes back from travel (from anywhere internationally including USA, Mexico, etc.) have to quarantine for 14 days... So that basically means that it's recommended that nobody should travel outside of Canada. lol"
""". In Quebec they just said an hour ago that whoever comes back from travel (from anywhere internationally including USA, Mexico, etc.) have to quarantine for 14 days... So that basically means that it's recommended that nobody should travel outside of Canada. lol""No one should be traveling anywhere for now, in my opinion anyway. Unless it's actually a complete and total necessity- which would be very few cases.We just had our first confirmed case here in Sask and I just heard our first suspected case of an employee in my company- who is under quarantine at his home waiting for the test outcome (had been in Italy on vacation)."
"I must try one more time to convey the real danger with Covid-19 transmission.- It has nothing to do with the number of identified cases in Mexico.- It has EVERYTHING to do with the crowds in the international airports, in the planes themselves (miniature cruise ships, breathing everyone elses' ailments, trusting that the airlines are actually disinfecting all the surfaces...), the crowds in baggage claim, the crowds in customs, .... crowds in general, from who knows where ...- Maybe you will contract a dose and hopefully recover beautifully ... but how many people will you transmit it to that may not be as robust as you, that WON'T recover as beautifully.....This Is Going To Get Worse. I'm not crying Wolf; I'm reflecting the views of the vast majority of non-political medical authorities.Reschedule your trip until this clears up."
"""Reschedule your trip until this clears up.""That is as useful a suggestion as someone can provide.Then add in don't go shopping for food or hardware.  Don't go to movies. Stay 100 yards or more upwind of all people. Don't get gas.Don't go to work.Fearmongering is now useful."
There have been ZERO cases of COVID19 in the Yucatan either in Playa or Cancun. Obviously people need to exercise good hygiene washing hands and using sanitizer regularly which is also in abundant supply at resorts. That said fearmongering and trying to dissuade people from living their lives does not help either.

"Worldtraveler - There won't be any crowds due to the international level of hype regarding this virus. I've never seen anything with this small of international numbers (around 55K active cases worldwide right now according to John Hopkins map total - recovered ) cause stock markets to tumble and entire countries to cower in fear. It makes absolutely ZERO sense. I'm hopeful to travel on the 17th and wash my hands and avoid crowds as much as possible, which like I said will NOT be difficult with them thinned by fear.Edited: 5:16 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"Meanwhile, 5k people in the US have died so far in 2020 from the flue"
Hopefully headed there next Thursday.
"Guys most people who have this virus have not been tested because their symptoms are weak or non-existent, but they are transmitting the virus to others who might suffer or die. Also many countries have not done many tests yet or have not disclosed the real numbers to protect their economy or whatever. Believe me the numbers are much higher than we think. For governments all over the world to take such measures means that it's something serious. As for the flu, the % of mortality by number of cases is much lower than this virus AND they are also saying that this virus is transmitted much easier than the flu. So things can get bad very fast. Also the hospitals are not equipped to handle thousands of patients at once so many patients won't get the treatment like they are supposed to (for example respiratory machines), which is for example why many people are dying in Italy."
Today the Canadian government has advised against international travelhttps:/…
Calming news. Thank you.
Debating on cancelling our trip on the 28th. Afraid of the mandatory quarantine that may be put in effect when we return.
Sabrina F as of March 13 the Canadian government is requiring that children who travel to quarantine for 14 days on arrival home. So it’s a possible next step for US.
Edit to say it’s now all travellers retuning to Canada required to quarantine for 14 days
"Things are getting worse and more complex by the day. I wouldn't want to travel and by the time I have to return they might for example cancel flights and I find myself stuck in a foreign country. And even if I can comeback, once in my country they might have even stricter rules for travellers than something like 14 days of self-quarantine. I just don't think it's worth the risk. The goal of a vacation is to relax and have fun, not to stress about your surroundings, the news, coming back, etc."
i'm taking my trip.
"Ok but remember that your Canadian government said that it's at your own risk. If when you are ready to comeback they don't have flights anymore, they will not send you a private jet. Also your job will not necessarily pay you when you are back and in quarantine, because when you left you already knew the orders from the government. But hey you might get lucky and things can go better.Edited: 4:56 pm, March 14, 2020 "
Actually the Canadian government right now is asking all Canadian citizens currently abroad to comeback to Canada asap.
I’m not. It would not be a relaxing time worrying if I would be able to return to US.
"now that all the Canadians with dual citizenship are in Canada, the rest of us are on our own? And for them to announce this on a Saturday night after all the spring breakers left on Friday. Could our government be any more inept"
"I just cancelled my trip scheduled for tomorrow. The kicker is that I can’t guarantee getting home on March 23. I also would have to self-isolate if I get home. And the fact that prime minister Trudeau has not ruled closing the border? Where would I live on March 23rd? And how/when would I get home? At what cost? The “great deal” I got on my trip would dissipate as I spend an excessive amount of money on accommodations and flights if/when Canada lets me home if they close border. And the fact that I bought no cancellation insurance and Sunwing is allowing cancellations should tell you something. I lose $100/person. And get a voucher for remaining. I’m dreaming about a two week vacay in 2021 to make up for it. Would not be a relaxing trip. Those of you still going, are dillusional. Life is changing hour by hour. What happens while you’re away is really far away and evolving, too risky. Do your part everyone, stay home."
"We’ve cancelled our trip for 2 weeks from now. We love Playa and I’ve been there 30+ times since the early 70s. There’s no point in going there now. The Mexican government has been sluggish in testing people (even worse than the USA) and staying ahead of the problem. The chronically high level of government corruption - amusing when the stakes are low - makes any “official” statements questionable. And local hospitals, which provide excellent health care under normal circumstances, will be quickly overwhelmed. See you next year."
"Did you end up going? If so, how was the resort dealing with the coronavirus? We have a group supposed to go the end of April. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!"
"Been watching this unfold since mid Jan, the cases in mex by comparing to other international places are in all intents probably greatly higher, if you are considering making your trip you should rethink your actions as this is not a joke and forseeably going to get much worst before better, the time for being selfish has past and the time to be prudent is here, just my opinion, I hope I'm wrong."

We were due to arrive in 2 weeks but UK travel now not happening so our holiday has been cancelled.Very sad but maybe next year. I just hope businesses survive
People need to stop saying or suggesting that COVID-19 will not cause any problems in Mexico because it will not survive in the heat. That is not true!!!
"Marcus S, if you are directing that at me...I said I didn't know if it was true or not. Reread what was written and chill out."
"After listening to the president this morning, I think the concern is worldwide. This is a pandemic and that’s a serious issue. I would certainly check with the state department website and follow their advice. I know there are people on this website to see the state department is on reliable but I failed to see their position on it. Take this serious folks. This is a serious issue."
Not an attack on you but just an appeal for everyone to stop saying that CORVID-19 can't survive in hot climates. Yes you did say you don't know if it's true or not. Best to not bring it up at all as a possibility. Be safe and I hope you enjoy the rest of your stay.
"Thanx Marcus S, I along with everyone else, hope this is over sooner than later. I have debated more than once on going home, due to my elderly parents. It's a tough call, considering I'd be staying away from them for 2 weeks anyhow. No easy answers for anyone, on any of this. Just coming out of winter and being stuck home by no choice of their own, is no good for anyone. I truly wish everyone the best thru this and amazing vacations in the future."
"Just think of it this way, the virus is in other countries that have similar weather or even hotter than Mexico. Think Thailand, the Philippines, Brazil..etc. I think the confusion may have started when the President stated that “he thinks hot weather will make it go away”. I think he is mixing this virus up with the flu which typically takes hold during cooker months and then subsided until the next season. This virus isn’t acting the same way, so no..heat doesn’t seem to be slowing this one down. Take care and stay safe. No hat, just kindness from an RN working on the frontlines."
"Top experts (Dr Osterhelm is one I believe) were putting out hope that the US has a warmer than average Spring and that the heat may indeed help. The term Lou Dobbs used was “the Heavens coming to the aid of science” or similar...May be still too early to know, not sure,"
"Yep Thailand is generally always in the 90's and it did OK there and India. I think its man-made, got our of a Chinese warfare lab by mistake. That or they wanted to reduce their aging population, so weird it targets mostly airwaves of over 70's?!?!?Edited: 9:19 am, March 20, 2020 "
Laura you’re an idiot.
"Agreed, DO NOT TRAVEL NOW. Stop trying to find a way to justify it. This will only increase the spread. This is no joke. DO NOT TRAVEL!!!!!"
Yes for sure since this virus is carried in many ways. You should take measures not to be in crowds or restaurants.
"Laura: How can you post such non-sense? From the news “BANGKOK: Thailand recorded 60 new coronavirus cases in the biggest daily jump in the number of cases so far to take its total infections to 272, a health official said on Thursday (Mar 19).“"

"Seriously. Lou Dobbs? WTF? Oh, and Osterholm definitely did NOT say that. He said exactly the opposite. FFS, people. This is your brain on Fox..."
"Calling ppl names helps. You ppl are unbelievable, sit around and tell ppl to do what YOU think is the right thing and then criticize them when they don't follow your lead. I'm not talking about Government mandates. Tell me this....I was here before the outbreak was talked about,do I go home now, to be quarantined or do I stay here for as long as possible? Just so you know my intelligence or lack thereof. I listen to Limbaugh. Have fun with it"
"I’m not making fun of you. I want everyone to be Safe no matter what that takes. I have good friends who live in Mexico and I’m as concerned for them as I am for folks in the Us. I SM a nurse at a large hospital who is working directly with these patients. The issue still is that there is a lack of testing kits and labs to process them quickly. This is causing a ripple effect as the test can’t be offered to everyone as a “screen”. This is an unfortunate truth. Hospitals are given guidance by the CDC how to classify people as low or high risk. This is now based on symptomatic CS non symptomatic patients. My concern for you is that Mexico’s healthcare system overall is not as strong as the one in the US to begin with. I am seeing even our large system start to get overwhelmed and lack supplies. If this goes widespread in Mexico (and there is no reason to believe it won’t based on current spread and travel practices in and out of Mexico) the question only you can answer is where you will safer if the hospitals are overwhelmed and taking care of their citizens first. Also with the travel advisory in place atone point you may have no option to return. The choice is clearly yours as a free human being, I just want you to know that I care about you."

Clmeade you must be a loser listening to Limbaugh
Southwest Airlines just announced last flights from US in and out of Cancun are scheduled for March 22. If you are on Southwest with departure after this date you better give them a call.

"Thank you Senora Fabulosa, waiting on a flight change now."
"Marc M and WorldTraveler, please keep your politics for yourselves. Thank you !"
Hope you get home safe. For the record I’m a member of the liberal left but I’m more then happy to save political discussions until after a crisis is in check. There is no way to “unring” a bell no matter what your views are in what has happened in the US in the last few weeks. We all have to be present in the here and now for a crisis. If we do this there will be plenty of time for vigorous political debate later! Safe travels and stay well.
"Thank you again, you've been more than helpful and I also enjoy political banter. Just not under the circumstances...hopefully soon tho"
"I truely want to believe you are correct about the low number of cases, but the skeptic in me doesn't quite trust the whole story coming out of Mexico. If it hit the resort areas, and it got publicized, their economy would fold faster than a house of cards."
"To those posting “go and buy travel insurance “, Covid19 is not a valid reason to cancel unless you get it yourself. I bought the insurance from Expedia and found out the hard way"
Most travel insurance policies do NOT cover epidemics/pandemics and certainly won't cover it if you book knowing this risk already exists.
"I am in Mexico right now - Playa del Carmen to be exact. The numbers here are currently low - but it is essential you understand WHY they are currently low. This virus spreads ; that means countries are at different places in the virus cycle. Mexico is *just entering* phase 2 which is the spread throughout the population. It is during that phase that ALL countries see a rise in their number of cases. So, of course, Mexico numbers will begin to rise quickly now. Major resorts have shut down - including most 5* AI. But the lack of people at the resorts is the number 1 factor in those closures. It’s a money driven decision. Now, let me also say NO country has accurate numbers on this. Italy, for example, is not giving tests to people over 60 who display flu like symptoms, the exact age most susceptible and the symptoms the virus mimics. Same for France. So we can assume both countries have significantly higher than reported numbers of ill and of carriers. USA has more liberal testing restrictions do of course more numbers of each group. Mexico has neither the money nor the healthcare system to support what is needed to weather this pandemic well. I am here now. I have been for weeks. But I am leaving this week. Bats and restaurants are closed or closing early now. In another week, if the government is not totally irresponsible, they will be ordered closed. Less than 1% of the population has masks available to them. Hand sanitizer is gone and had been since I arrived. The beach yesterday was almost completely empty. Only Lido Beach Club was open and they had no food available. (Maybe Mamitas, I did not walk down that far) 1 in 5 off 5th Ave restaurants are closed. Most on 5th Ave are still open but less than 1/6 full. (They will close soon due to financial sense, I am sure) If I was not here, I would not come. They are getting g ready to enter the riskiest stage and I see little prepared to handle it despite the lo get ramp up notice they got. Just yesterday they began to look at reopening the closed Tulum hospital. That won’t be ready to open for over a month. This is a highly social society; they buy food daily or for no more than 2 days because many still don’t have means to keep it at home longer. Many are used to eating 2 meals a day out and have little to no saved resources to care for themselves and their families. And some here still don’t believe this is real or think they are genetically immune to Covid 19. This is going to move quickly across Mexico and it’s not going to be good when it does. That’s why I’m going home."
I am not a gloom and doom traveler. But I’m here now and this is what I see and believe.
