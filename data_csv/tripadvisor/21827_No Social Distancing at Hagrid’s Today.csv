"Read some of the comments, not true according to many who were there."
"Yeah this has been disputed on Twitter . If it happened Universal heard the backlash and responded.Or it could have been a ploy by the newly developed universal parks news today to get some attention, which they did get attention. Who knows but I still trust Orlando informer for Universal news."

Have a look at some of the YouTube videos and you will see what it was like.People weren't wearing masks and there was a real lack of social distancing.
I am not impressed with this new site Universal parks news today. Now they are posting from the Bourne preview after specifically being asked boy to post the show. Seems an intentional ploy for followers or controversy.
"If anyone goes to a normally insanely busy amusement park and expects there to be proper social distancing and everyone wearing masks, you're unrealistic. ESPECIALLY in Florida where beaches were open to spring breakers when the rest of the country was shutting down."
Virus numbers in Florida are rising sharply. Virus is beginning to rage again.
"#12..According to “worldometer” 7 deaths (though extremely sad) today. How does that make “Virus beginning to rage?”Deaths per million in Florida so far is 137 (again extremely sad)..Do you have different stats that we can't see??Edited: 5:21 pm, June 15, 2020 "
"Well today has not ended so I am sure that’s an estimate of deaths. But the poster is not discussing deaths The average number of cases end of May was less than 1000 in Florida, last confirmed day June 13 2581 tested positive in Florida.https:/…florida"
"More up to date/accurate numbers can be found at:https://floridacovidaction.comThis is the site started by the scientist, who was fired by the state, because she didn't want to under-report the numbers."
"Mike, many reliable sources show the virus spiking, If you look at the NY Times chart it looks like a spike to me.https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-liv…https:/…florida-coronavirus-cases.html."
"This one goes state by state over the past two weeks but note the scale on the y axis changes by state. Florida, Texas had to have the largest scales. https:/…"
"My teen boys rode this ride on Sunday, June 14th and again on Monday, June 15th and said most people were following the social distancing markers and rules, but just like anywhere we have been there were a few not following the guidelines. I have to say on a whole that I was impressed with the parks with their cleaning, employees requesting to cover your nose if it was not covered, etc., and reminding people to keep your distance. Universal was practically empty on Monday though."
"Maybe a lot of people aren't ready yet to go to a theme park? It isn't something I would do while we're still in the grip of the pandemic but each to their own!Edited: 1:07 am, June 17, 2020 "
