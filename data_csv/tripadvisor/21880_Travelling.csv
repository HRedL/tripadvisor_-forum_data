I'm schedule to travel from kansas to las vegas tomorrow. What's happening at the airport with Spirit airlines?
"“What’s happening at the airport?”In what way?Las Vegas is in the middle of shutting things down - concerts, shows, buffets, clubs, and much much more. Casinos *might* begin closing this weekend, or by Monday??However, that does not yet apply to airports, so not sure what you are asking.Best of luck,Hunt"
