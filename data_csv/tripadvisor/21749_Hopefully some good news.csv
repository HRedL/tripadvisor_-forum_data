"That's great news but it does say ""hoping"" not definite. I think every destination all over the world is hoping but Greece in its favour has had a low Coronavirus count.https:/…"
"Personally i think its too early to even think about travel. Staying safe is the number one priority, the front line workers have done an amazing job so lets help them out now and stay healthy and not to burdan them with us getting sick ."
"Now if i was looking at how to restart tourism i would look at countries below mine that visit the country and slowly allow them in.So for Zakynthos that may be Slovakia, Bulgaria, Albania, Croatia, Iceland.Now the reason i chose them is because i have had tourists in my bar from those countries but its better than nothing. For places like Spain and Italy that's difficult as below them there are many countries with high counts but they could choose much lower case countries to restart who visit Spain, Italy etc.Edited: 2:28 pm, April 27, 2020 "
"Kevin. I know you MIGHT be correct in your outlook but you are always looking on the bad side of things. I was due to go to Nessebar Bulgaria June but flight cancelled. I've also had 2 x Spanish holidays cancelled as well as a 4 day break at a Warners in UK. Inconveiniant & upsetting but not life changing. I have one more holiday left back to Zakynthos Sept. Please give me something to look forward to, If the Airlines start flying again, UK allows us to fly. Greece ecepts us into their country I will be on that plane,. First of all we've got to get rid of this virus for us all. KEEP SAFE"
"Its not the bad side, its the realistic side and its not a negative post as i stated Greece has a low virus count in its favour. Look at the UK, every 3 weeks a review of lockdown. I'd prefer them to say lockdown is until August then if its lifted early its a bonus.I myself would prefer it that way than a hopeful early date given then changed yet again till a later date.Also with Zakynthos doing so well with containing the virus do they really want to let tourists in too soon and devastate the island? The island has a very high elderly population due to the lifestyle. It's a tiny island and would take hardly anything to spread through every resort and village."
"What I'm saying is IF & a bloody big IF, The British government say it's safe to travel, The Airlines start flying again And last of all IF the Greek government says they are happy to recieve us all again I WILL be on that plane. BUT if any of these three are not applicable I will NOT be flying. I do not wish to contaminate Zakynthos or catch the virus on the way there. At this moment I am still looking forward to getting out there in Sept BUT if it don't happen maybe next year.Edited: 5:17 pm, April 27, 2020 "
"And as expected the event i was going to in June has just now been cancelled until 2021 which is fine as now flights can also be re-scheduled if cancelled or not, just have to wait a year."
How can we be sure theat next year will not have same problem? or other pandemy.
"#11I'm more sure of the concert going ahead in June 2021 than them saying its postponed until July 2020., then when July is a no go them saying August 2020 then on and on.The money for concert and flights already spent anyway and my apartment is cancel up to 48hrs before arrival and no pre-payment. So not really lost anything.So its roll on June 2021."
