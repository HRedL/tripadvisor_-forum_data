"We are considering a trip in august through Namibia with a two year old baby. We wanted to include the Etosha park, but I was wondering if there is malaria or not and also other possible epidemic diseases."
"Ira-If you read a post I started a few days ago ""when to start malarone tablets"" there is a discussion bu a very reliable source on there about the risk of malaria. Also, there is a link to a ""malaria map"" for namibia. It was helpful to me and might help you as well. To sum it up, there is a risk in Etosha for malaria and medication is recommended. As far as a 2 year old, you should certianly talk to you doctor about the appropriate medication. There is a pediatric dose of malarone, but I believe it is for over 2 year olds. A travel clinic would know for sure.A 2 year old would need to be up to date on all of his/her vaccinations. May need to get some extra as well. You would want to start this soon since some require a series of vaccinations (Hep A, B). Once again, an experienced travel doctor could tell you. I would ask now and get things started.I am traveling with my 2 daughters, but they are a few years older. They will be taking the malaria medication and had to get a couple of booster shots.Good news is no typhoid or yellow fever needed."
I am not up to date with 2 yr olds. (the terrible twoS!!) Watch the sun and cover up. As Stephen says Etosha is Malarial but in August it should be dry enough not to get too excited about that.You forget the map stephen.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/destinations/africa/namiâ€¦Edited: 8 years ago 
"Thanks for sharing the map mfuwe. Sorry I forgot it.I will re-iterate my opinion, with any child I would ask your travel doctor that has experience with kids.I did do some research. Malarone can be used safely in children to prevent malaria down to a weight of 24 pounds or about 11kg. It can be used to treat malaria in kids down to about 10 pounds or 4.5 kg. So the size of your 2 year old will make a difference. There are also some restrictions with liver and kidney issues, but any travel doctor will know those things. Of course, able to prescribe and your willingness to give to them are 2 different issues. Other anti-malarial certainly have issues with young kids as well.Something to discuss with your doctor"
"The risk of mossies is so slight compared to the risk from the tablets for a small child that there could be a case for not prescribing them. Just rely on covering up, some mild Anti mossie and keep under a net.I'm not saying you should do this but it should be considered."
"We took advice here in the UK when travelling to Etosha in their winter (July/August) and were told that prophylactics were needed. Thankfully our research using locals on the ground told us otherwise. All of the locals we spoke to as we travelled in Namibia thought that this advice was far too over the top. We have given our daughter various prophylactics in the past but did not on this trip.You might try to contact a pharmacist or doctor, etc in Namibia (via you travel company or a lodge?) who can give you current local advice. Most of what you get overseas is overly cautious IMO and will invariably suggest prophylactics whose benefits may be far outweighed by the risks associatied with using them at certain times/places."
