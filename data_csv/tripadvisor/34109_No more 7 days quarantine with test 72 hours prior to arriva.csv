"No more 7 days quarantine with test 72 hours prior to arrival.If a person traveling to Ethiopia is able to provide a negative Covid-19 test result that has been completed no more than 72 hours prior to arrival in the country, it is not necessary for that person to complete the previously prescribed 7-day quarantine. Travelers wishing to take advantage of the new rules must register an address (e.g. hotel, friend address, and relative or tour agency office) upon arrival.A person who does not have a certified negative Covid-19 test result will be put in quarantine for 7 days at a state-nominated hotel and an additional 7 days at a preferred address."
"Thank you this Information is available on UK travel advice.QuarantinePassengers arriving into the country are subject to mandatory self-isolation or quarantine.Passengers carrying a negative Covid-19 test certificate dated within the previous 72 hours are required to take a new test and to self-isolate at home for 14 days. All other passengers will be subject to 7 days mandatory quarantine, followed by a further 7 days self-isolation at home, where possible. Mandatory quarantine will be at government designated hotels. You may choose from a range of hotels at different prices, but cannot change hotel once your quarantine has started. Passengers are responsible for the full cost of their stay in quarantine. You may need to demonstrate that you have made a hotel booking for your quarantine before boarding your flight.Contact your airline for more details. Those in quarantine will be monitored by the Ethiopian health authorities and may be tested for coronavirus . You may be moved to an isolation facility if you develop symptoms.https:/…entry-requirements"
"Once you show your test result upon arrival, you can walk free out of the terminal. No body follow your address or whereabouts."
The new rules involving the provision of a negative test are not in until next Wednesday so you cannot be saying this from personal experience? it is still mandatory quarantine until Wednesday.
"Since Saturday, June 19, the government announced that it has revised some of the restrictions including shortening a mandatory 14-day quarantine of arrivals from abroad.Travelers arriving at Bole International airport with proof of a negative RT-PCR test within 72 hours prior to arrival that are free of signs and symptoms of COVID-19 at screening:Travelers who have family in Ethiopia with whom they can safely quarantine at home in accordance with Article 26 will submit a sample and be registered with health authorities. They are then permitted to complete their 14-day mandatory quarantine at their home, hotel, appartmemts so long as they comply with Article 25 ."
A link you may need to refer: https:/…
"Just to clarify, the changes really only effect people who live in Ethiopia or have family they can stay with. You still have to isolate for 14 days. It's just that now with a negative test you may quarantine from your home instead of paying for a hotel, or you may spend 7 days in a hotel without a test and the last 7 days at your home."
Yes that is correct you now avoid paying for hotel.
"Yes indeed information is correct.Here in London, test cost nearly £200. You get your results within 48 hours. Even Yellow Card holders need this certificate too.Mostly private doctors do the test.But is a great start for travel in magically nation.Edited: 3:30 pm, June 29, 2020 "
Its worth paying for the certificate as it would cost you more money in a hotel in Ethiopia. I will be doing my test closer to my departure date.
"As of today all travelers arriving at Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa carrying a certificate of negative PCR SARS-CoV-2 test, done up to 5 days before arrival, will be able to go out of the airport after giving samples upon arrival."
Hi I brought a test but they didn’t accept it and I am quarantined. My question is when I am allowed to leave I will go to Lalibela - how do they check the isolation??
How do they check isolation when you leave Addis?
"As I understand it and this appears on Ethiopian airlines website: All travellers arriving at Bole International airport who can bring a certificate of negative PCR SAR-CoV test done up to 5 days before arrival to Ethiopia, will be required mandatory 14-day self-quarantine at home after giving sample upon arrival. ME: THIS MEANS IF YOUR PCR IS ACCEPTED THAT YOU NOMINATE AN ADDRESS AT WHICH YOU MUST STAY FOR 14 DAYS BEFORE ANY FURTHER TRAVEL. THIS ADDRESS COULD BE AT HOME IN LALIBELA. All travelers with NO certificate of negative PCR SAR-CoV test done up to 5 days before arrival to Ethiopia as well as returnees will be quarantined at selected hotels including the Ethiopian Skylight Hotel for 7 days at passenger’s own expense or will be placed at different quarantine centers for 7 days. After 7 days, travelers will be tested and then self-isolated for an additional 7 days at home. ME: SO STILL 14 DAYS TOTAL . 7 DAYS IN HOTEL AND 7 DAYS AT NOMINATED ADDRESS WHICH COULD BE AT HOME IN LALIBELA. Again , as I understand it you give the home address at which you are quarantining on arrival if you have PCR or when you leave quarantine hotel after 7 days. The local health people will then check up on you. Ethiopia seems to be managing the outbreak better than many other countries so I think it behoves us arrivals , when we arrive, to respect the quarantine no matter how inconvenient and assume they will check."
"Yeah I assumed this as they have such strict measures at the airport but the comment board on this post suggests otherwise (ie that travellers are allowed to walk free from the airport?). I have somewhere to isolate in Lalibela but was intrigued how they will check given the size difference (and therefore facilities, budget and personnel difference) Between Addis and most other places in the country. Thanks for the info :)"
I think if you are going home essentially you do walk free from airport and are trusted to travel direct to address you give. I don't know how they check or how efficient but as is for general health and well being I would stay at nominated address regardless. I agree some posts imply end of quarantine if you have PCR ( I got equally excited when saw it too) but that means end of mandatory quarantine in hotel or isolation centre only . Stay safe
"Hi All, I have arrived in Addis Ababa Ethiopia safely I had my Covid-19 certificate and gave a new sample. The whole process took up to 1 hour. Straight forward and no issues. My recommendation make sure you have the correct test done SAR-CoV PCR take a colour copy of the certificate including the ""laboratory "" results."
"Thank you for update Khalid. Glad you have arrived safely and thank you for updating so quickly. Have the best time you can with your friends and family. Sharing your experiences of home quarantine would be useful if you feel able please. Above all, stay well."
No one check
"I flew from london Heathrow and flight was 7 hours. As long as you have the correct Covid-19 certificate things will become so easy.I had seen people with incorrect certificate and were placed in quarantine and they were angry and having arguments with health agents. I gave a new sample for Covid-19 once on arrival. I recommend to buy the visa online and print it out in colour this will save you the hassle and long wait for visa on arrival.There are frequent power cuts so bring a ""charging power"" device to store battery. Its rainy season in Ethiopia so hardly any sunshine and it would be good to bring a coat/ jacket and a jumper.The authorities have not called to check if i went out or not i don't think they are bothered as long as you have your certificate and give new sample. I went outday for fresh air. Please feel free to ask questions about my experience in Ethiopia."
Thanks Khalid. Did you manage to get travel insurance to cover you for any eventuality given Ethiopia is not on the UK approved list? Have a great time and take care
No travel insurance as Ethiopia is not on the exemption list. But not worried about it as I am only here for 2 weeks I am staying with relatives. And I work from home in the UK so self isolation will not be an issue.There are many great tourist destinations to visit but with the current political climate its not recommended maybe once things clam down. Also best to bring US $ dollars with you if you have pound £ sterling you will get a good exchange rate depends where you go. Also best to respect local customs and culture as Ethiopia is mainly Muslim and Christian country where everyone is free to practice and there is religious harmony which I really like. Also buy a Simcard at the airport its cheape as outside they will scam you and use prepaid 3G data internet bundle.
How/where did you get test and certificate in UK please?
"Google Covid-19 SAR-CoV PCR test and you will find loads. I am not sure where you live in UK. But I got my one done in Manchester, they have brance in London. Type in doctorcall they are professional and excellent service. Make sure you mention your travelling abroad and you need it. Result are sent out by email within 48hours they will send you a secure password encryption so only you can access your results.Make sure you download the ""laboratory "" results and ""certificate letter"" in colour you need both of them. At the clinic make sure you bring your passport as ID as they will use the passport number on the letter. The test took 20 seconds I couldn't believe how fast it was. They do a swab on the nose and throat. I don't have tonsils got it removed when I was in school so it was comfortable. If you have tonsils its a little bit comfortable but no issues."
i think City Doc does too but this may be postal depending on where you live.
Yes you will find loads on the internet
Thank you K..enjoy your visit.
"Hi Khalid, did you get any checkups on your quarantine address? And what about the sample you give on arrival, did you get the result back? Good to have someone with first-hand experience.."
"No they didn't even ask for my address as they will ask you this question if you get Visa on arrival its mandatory question they ask you. However I had my online visa which i already included the address and my friend number. I also printed and i showed my visa then they didn't even say anything.They will randomly ask people if they staying in hotel or address but its no big deal.After you give a sample on arrival they give you a ticket or receipt with your passport number ( make sure you don't lose) this as you will NOT be allowed to leave the airport and you might have to do another sample. No They don't give you any results at all. If they find your positive they will then call you.However nobody has checked up on me at all and I am free to roam around the city but I never go out without facemask.In there airport it can be a bit havoc as so many people and not many staff speak English so can be difficult to communicate.The ""Blue"" taxi are very old models and are the cheapest the ""yellow "" Toyota have a meter so they will charge you by the meter you can not negotiate. The yellow taxi are comfortable and modern but can be expensive. The blue taxi you can easily get a cheaper ride."
"Thanks Khalid, very good to know all this! I will have my own transport so no problems at all with taxis etc. :)"
"One more good news,Emirates has a new strategy for boosting passenger demand in the midst of a global pandemic: coronavirus insurance. If one of its passengers is diagnosed with COVID-19 during their journey, the Dubai-based airline will cover their medical expenses, up to €150,000 (about $176,000)."
The move comes as Emirates tries to boost passenger confidence and demand during the coronavirus pandemic — the airline is only flying about 10% as many passengers as normal.
@16 and 19. Khalid great information.
I will be back to United Kingdom in less then 2 weeks any questions please free to ask. As long as you have the correct Covid-19 certificate you will have no issues. Most people make the mistake of the incorrect certificate the Free NHS letter will NOT be accepted.
"Thank you very much for what you say, I am in Italy and I will travel to Ethiopia at the beginning of September, I ask here some information for the test of codiv, they do the test and after they give the result in 48h, and then the trip.... so maybe i go more then 72h... it is 3 days or 5 days?"
And the certificate must be in English? Here they do in Italian ... thanks
Italian is fine as well
Get English as the health authorities can read English and also speak it. If you can get both Italian and English even better. You don't want any complications so just get it in English. It needs to be valid 5 days so when you arrive in Ethiopia it should fall within the 5 days
Thanks
Make sure you print the letter in colour with the laboratory results this is important. They will not accept it if you show them email or on your mobile screen. Once they check your temperature you go to visa on arrival or if you already have visa online then you go downstairs to give a new sample on arrival. Once you do that they will give you a small receipt with your passport number PLEASE DO NOT LOSE THIS as you will DO another test. You give them your passport and recipet at the exit of airport.
"Hi everyone.I arrived in Ethiopia last Saturday night (01st of August) at 19:55h. Can I leave the country, due to quarantine, on a flight Saturday 15th of august, early morning (00:40h)?I mean, how do they count the days of quarantine?Regards."
Ask the airline...people on here unlikely to know...
Hi I landed back safely to United Kingdom from Ethiopia it was a good trip however it was constantly raining and no sunshine. Try and visit in the Summer you would enjoy it better.
July and August are always very wet in Addis
Yes that is true also on a negative note there where frequent power cuts we had no electricity for 5 days in the area where I was staying. I had to charge my phone near a hotel this was really annoying and ruined my trip. Most tourist place where closed even the traditional Ethiopian cultural centre.
What about the test from NHS at walkin or drive through centres? Now anyone can get the test done. Do you think rhey will accept a text or emailresult from NHS?
No they don't. Needs to be as described by Khalid as described here and in other posts.
NHS letter will not be accepted you need to do it at private clinics cost £150. Please refer back to previous post for more information.
