"Is there anyone in the same situation like us not receiving the “ cancellation fees”back for a trip/ tour to Kakadu Ancient Secrets booked for August 2020 and indeed we canceled it just because of coronavirus situation ?? The all tourism industry in the world did it without hesitation, why NT Australia act differently?? Thank you, Vivian& Gabriel"
Did you book directly with the tour company?
"If you look around the forums, you will find that many companies are charging cancellation fees. The pandemic is not your fault, but it is not the fault of the tour company either."
It is not the NT- it is a tour company. Yes- who did you book through?
"No the whole world isn’t giving refunds. Absolute nonsense. Look at the air travel forum or any country forum and you will see businesses that stick to the booking terms, others that gjve future credits and some that give refunds."
"You have not come back and said who you booked with. This is not a witch hunt, but my reading of this is that you cancelled before they did, and maybe inside of the cancellation date to get a refund!? Interesting as Kak will be open in June and maybe borders in August, so if I were a tour company i may be holding out that they can swing back into operation. How much are we talking about anyway?"
Well Lifes an Adventure have cancelled all of their tours to the NT and Queensland for this year They have rescheduled us for next June at the same priceWe also have a sailing expedition cruise booked in Indonesia for October. I am waiting to hear from the company. I expect we will be rescheduled there as well but I will not be cancelling anything. If we had cancelled our NT trip we would definitely have lost our deposit. That was the T&Cs we agreed to when we booked.
"AAT KINGS guided holidays did not cancelled any of their tours and they are the one that withheld $400. Yes, we cancelled well before the due date just because of this pandemic my wife who for years had chemotherapy and suffer with a rare immune disease can not jeopardize her health more than that."
"Totally understand why you did that. Same situation with us last year- one child broke ankle before ski trip- we had to cancel her trip- lost some fees, but I didnt expect that they lose out because of our cancelling."
"We ALL are in the same boat, to be complacent about rules, regulations, etc.Petty for our time to write somewhere or to someone to complain or to say about something. The “ square shape “ of an answer !!! Really??? Can WE step over it? Can WE ,like consumers , shout our dissatisfaction ?? The true “ color “ of some of those businesses come through like the oil from the water. Very disappointing......"
Whaaat? These businesses also have to survive and protect themselves- just as you are doing.
"Thanks for all those “good “ “” suck it up, cop it on the chin”” words. It’s very easy to talk when you don’t know the individual circumstances !!!How about their own insurance ? Being in a business ( at list in Australia !) you must have insurance.To be judgmental is sooooo easy.Once again, thanks ."
I think you are wrong. Most of the replies on here seem to me to be very sympathetic of the reason why you cancelled. Many of us also have a personal story and examples the same as yours.
"OP,Not sure where you call home and what it is like. I feel for you, I had a trip booked to Thailand last year, I only carry insurance for my Health care . At the last minute, a family issue I had to decide the day before not to travel. By the time I paid all the cancel fees , it was ""cop it on the Chin"" and move on.The company you mention would carry plenty of insurance , however that does not mean people who have entered into a contract and then decide not to proceed , that is for you to carry..Many people around the world have lost their life, businesses have closed , people unemployed. Some will go bankrupt.Good Luck"
