"Even if you ignore those numbers, numbers you can't ignore are how many people are here now. So. Many. Tourists. Everywhere. It's like there was an advertising campaign in the south telling everyone to come here this summer. Maybe go to a beach instead. If someone is willing to drive 15-20 hours to come to CO, they could probably get to a beach in that time or less."

"Beach sounds great. If only there was one in my county, Then I'd go. Sadly I am following the restrictions and staying close to home."
"We cancelled our CO trip and are hoping to go next August. We were supposed to fly from Newark (EWR) today and a week ago the flight was about half full and then when I looked on Saturday it was fully booked!!! We got a full refund (United). Clearly a lot of people on the east coast are flying out to Denver now which really surprised me. In NJ / NY there is a list of over 30 that states that if we visit, we'd need to qurantine for 14 days upon our return to NJ / NY. As of now CO is not one of those states so I think that may be the appeal?"
"Thank you bergenfamily for being responsible and canceling! I hope your visit next year is a good one.Edited: 11:17 am, August 03, 2020 "

"I wouldn't go to that overrun petri dish of disease right now if my life depended on it, and it probably does."
Incorrect. Numbers are actually trending down in every category.
"KAP, I don’t know where you get your info, but alli is giving accurate stats. Numbers ARE going up! Hospitalizations are the key number and it is up. Overwhelming the health care system/hospitalizations are the key number, especially in the smaller population areas."
"Aggregate numbers are going up (obviously). But daily numbers are, and have been for some time, trending down. Hospitals are not over capacity and are not ""overwhelmed""."
"Agust 13 data 51,756 cumulative cases, UP from 51,441 the day prior.6,685 cumulative hospitalizations, UP from 6,679 the day prior.1,875 deaths among those who tested positive for COVID-19, the SAME as the day prior1,756 deaths due to COVID-19, UP from 1,751 the day prior."

"Respectively Becky, I am not sure where you're getting your information from. All I see is the numbers are UP. Best case is one instance of the Same. I'll celebrate when cases start going down. I'll celebrate when our kids can go back to school. I'll celebrate if we have a ski season. Right now none of those things look like a given. Now is not the time for recreational travel."

"More perspective.....The US has 4% of the world's population, and now has 25% of the world's COVID cases. We obviously are not doing something right."
"Prepared by the Colorado COVID-19 Modeling Group Colorado School of Public Health:""Summary• COVID-19 hospitalizations have been increasing since late June.• The estimated effective reproductive number has increased over the past two weeks and is now at the highest estimated value since late March. Social distancing has declined since May.• Collectively, these data indicate that the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Colorado has changed over the past two months, from a curve of declining infections in May to a curve of increasing infections (Figure 3). Our most recent model results suggest the rate of increase has changed from slow growth to a more rapid increase in cases. There is still uncertainty about the rate of increase. The estimates will be more certain as we track the rate of increase over the next week.• If Colorado remains on the current estimated trajectory, we expect to exceed intensive care unit (ICU) capacity in early September. If social distancing continues to decline, we could exceed hospital capacity in late August. Under these scenarios, without additional interventions or changes in social distancing, demand could greatly exceed hospital capacity.• If social distancing is increased or other interventions to reduce transmission are implemented, the projected growth in infections and hospital demand is slower and, depending on the efficacy of these interventions, ICU capacity is reached in the fall or not at all.""For all my data science friends"

"One can only hope that everyone follows suit with the last paragraph. On a personal note, my daughter has been in the hospital in Gunnison for almost a week with some sort of viral infection. They are still doing tests to determine COVID. She had been working on a rural farm near Paonia, and had minimal if any contact with people. Had been in superb health and is an avid rock climber. My wife is flying out on Saturday for maternal healing, hopefully."
"Oh no, EricP. I hate to hear this."
"Thanks. Didn't mean to get personal, but it might be COVID, so kinda not off topic. I'll touch base at your other address with a good update."
"I'm praying for your daughter Eric. Hope we hear good things very soon.I do know one thing - schools are starting up here in our area this week. Dorms at universities are filling, classrooms are filling and I think our covid counts will go up."

"I have been closely watching Colorado data since we decided to visit. I am ready to cancel if the daily cases trend up. I have to say that I agree with Becky's analysis, that one needs to distinguish daily new cases and cumulative cases. The latter will always go up or stay the same, but the trend of daily new cases is what one should look for, as well as the positivity rate. The same goes for the hospitalization data.Colorado publishes excellent detailed data, much better than many other states. It also provides very good explanation of what each graph means, so no need for a data scientist to understand. https://covid19.colorado.gov/data/case-data. It clearly shows that the 3 day moving average cases went from 704 on July 24 (which is the same level as the Apr peak) to 254 on Aug 11, a clear downward trend. The positivity rate went from roughly 6% to 3% for the same period. I am sure the mask mandate and gradual reopening are the main reasons for the decline. They don't have daily hospitalization data, only cumulative, so one needs to look at the slope of the curve. The July rate is certainly higher than June, but appears to have slowed down in the last few days, with only 3 new hospitalization on Aug 11. Again, a good sign.Being a medical researcher, I take Covid-19 very seriously, but also will look at data objectively."

No need to focus on my profession (not that I will post my work ID here). Please focus on the data !
"I didn't Atl, you bragged about it. Data, sure Georgia has done such a great job getting kids back to school. Perhaps you have some tips for Colorado?"
Are some people that daft? Or just blinded by hatred and paranoia?
"""More perspective.....The US has 4% of the world's population, and now has 25% of the world's COVID cases. We obviously are not doing something right.""More perspective .... the US has tested far more than any other country (68 million+). More tests, more positive results. And yet still only a very small percentage of positive cases are serious or directly caused death.Edited: 5:45 pm, August 13, 2020 "
"167,000 dead Americans. ""It is what it is"""
We also have 23% of the deaths with 4% of the population. Seems like testing is in proportion.
"Good luck with your daughter, Eric. Hope she heals quickly from whatever ails her. I’m sure having Mom there will help."
"More perspective. The US has not tested far more than any other country. Total and complete lie that has become a baseless right-wing talking point.#1 in testing in the world is China at over 90 million tests completed.For tests as a proportion of the population, the US is currently ranked #19.There are currently only two categories where the US is leading every other country in the world: Total number of cases (5.5 million) and total number of deaths (170,000).Both of those numbers continue to rise and yet people are still planning a fun family vacation during a national state of emergency caused by a global pandemic that has already killed close to a million people."
Not sure why the post from LTdreams was removed?
"I agree. I thought the information LTdreams provided in reply #36 was very helpful and appropriate. Perhaps, LTdreams will repost it."
"Besides COVID-19, you should know that the main West/East interstate I 70 is closed due to the fires.""The fire has had a major impact on travel as it has forced a full closure of Interstate 70 and Independence Pass. Detours to get around are hours long.Polis said the highway cannot reopen until it's been about 24 hours without fire around it.""Literally the fire is right on Highway 70,"" he said. ""The best realistic scenario would be two to three days, but it really a case of when it's no longer on the highway. I want people to know this is closure because literally fire is on highway 70 in some places.""Polis urged everyone who is outdoors camping or hiking to be extra vigilant due to the extremely dry conditions.""I want to make sure it's message to campers and others to really limit activities that could cause fires as we go about our daily lives,"" he said. ""Likely continued dry conditions perhaps less winds in the next few days, but we're in this for the long haul."""
"Actually the interstate will not open until rock mitigation is done. The plants holding the rocks in place are gone so as folks who are familiar with the canyon know, huge boulders have killed folks in the past and will again if proper care is not taken."
Is it time for more Texans to recreationally travel to Colorado? There aren't really many posts expressing an opinion on this.
"Ollie, I get you're trying to be funny. But you should know that many people posting here are worried about their homes, livestock, and health. Im guessing your lucky to never have had to face leaving your home not knowing if it will be there when you return. Add to that having your small town overrun with people from hotspot states thinking is is a great time to travel. Not a care in the world and much to busy having a good good time to consider the consequences of thier behavior.Edited: 10:27 am, August 15, 2020 "
"Not sure what I posted that was unrelated to this topic. I see the inaccurate information in post #32 is still up, but I'm glad the xenophobic response to my correction was removed. I think it's important that visitors to Colorado have the most current information, since it's easy to lose sight of the fact that we're in a National State of Emergency cause by a global pandemic.Below is a link to the John Hopkins data site showing that the US leads in only 2 categories in the world; cases of Covid and deaths from Covid. Neither are statistics to brag about. https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-casesSpecific to Colorado, the IHME site provides an easy to navigate site with updated models of cases, deaths, and hospital resources.https:/…coloradoAs alli and others have pointed out, unless something drastic happens, Colorado is predicted to run out of ICU beds by early-November. Suggesting otherwise is like arguing that it's safe to keep the dance party going in a burning skyscraper because the flames haven't reached your floor yet. Either way, making jokes while 1000-2000 Americans die every day is the purview of sociopaths."
"Well said, LT. Thanks for persevering to tell the truth."
"Thank you alli, fv, and all the forum regulars who are providing so much helpful information during a very difficult time for Colorado, our country, and the world. You would think the state (literally) being on fire would slow the flood of visitors. However people taking fun family vacations --while more people die in the US every few days than on 9/11-- do not seem to be deterred by a little bit of smoke. So thanks again to you all for continuing to dedicate your time!"
Good to see post 36 reinstated.
