"We booked in February, before the Corona virus started, Anthena Studios in Skiathos. We did this via booking.com and it was a so-called non-refund. We went to Greece many times and never had any problems. Greek people are pleasant people, friendly and hospitable. Unfortunately, these Anthena studios do not. As usual, we paid in advance, the holiday would take place June 3, 2020. No one could foresee that there would be a global crisis and that the world would be turned upside down and locked. Similarly, Greece. It is still not allowed, to enter Greece. Our flight has been canceled. All other bookings for that month, in Greece, were not difficult and immediately returned our money, despite the nod-refund. But the owner of Anthena studios is not. Unfortunately, money only counts for them. This host indicates that we can cancel for the full price. In other words, too bad for you, but I keep the money you paid. He indicates that we should have known in early February that there was a crisis comming. Pretty clever from this host that he already knew in February what was going to happen. No compromise is possible. He literally indicates that he does not work in winter and that he has to earn money in summer. He now does this with bookings that cannot be made. How dare he call it 'earning'. In other words, thanks for the money, you can't come, but unfortunately whatever your problem, I have to think about myself, you won't get anything back. Scandalous. Yes, two days before departure, he indicates via booking.com that we can postpone it to next year, but only the date that Anthena Studios will arrange. Unfortunately we cannot. But he no longer answers mails. In the emails you only see what the true nature is, now in this bizarre time. Inhuman and therefore two faces.Booking.com is putting it on Anthena Studios. Booking.com even indicates that we can safely travel to Greece. Wonderful nevertheless."
If you book non-refundable then you take your chance. Not scandalous that's what you chose. Meanwhile there are millions of people who have booked refundable that haven't got it. All measurable risks not avoid the accommodation!
>>We did this via booking.com and it was a so-called non-refund.<<How can you expect a refund if you book non-refundable? You should be happy that the other accommodation owners did refund you allthough they were not obliged too as it were non-refundable bookings too.
"Wow, what a sense of entitlement! Non refundable bookings are cheaper than flexible bookings for a reason. As you booked before the onset of Covid 19, should you not be able to claim for this loss on your travel insurance. I presume you did purchase a policy."
"I’ll try again as you have had a few attempts at this. The family who own and run the Anthena Studios are lovely friendly people, they really are. You should negotiate with them to go next year, you will love it and will be missing out if you choose not to.As others have said, if it is non refundable then the owners are under no obligation to offer you anything. Stop moaning on here and trying to discredit them, those of us who are lucky enough to know them already know they are lovely, friendly people.They can’t do enough to help you. Take them up on their offer( if it still stands) because honestly if I was them, I’d remove the offer after this attempt to discredit them."
It looks as though Jackyboy is going to have to be told what non-refundable means as many times as it took for him to be told that he was referring to the wrong studios.
#5 Matt I’m not sure this thread should be allowed to stand tbh. People reading the title will think bad of the premises. It’s just not on.
Refundable or non refundable As the saying goes ^you pay your money and take your choice^It does exactly what it says on the label !
If the apartments are available on the 3rd of june and are open then unfortueately you are on a sticky wicket as the owner is within there rights to enforce a non-refundable contract.The onus is on you too make it to the accommodation. If they are not open then you have a right of redress as the the goods /service cannot be delivered and i would then look at how i paid the contract.Section 75 if paid via credit card or chargeback if paid by debit card are a starting point. Good luck in these uncertain times.
"You can say they are such nice people, but then I should let you read the emails. Normally, if it were my fault, I would have no qualms about losing my money. Would I break a leg or get sick or something, yes then I am unlucky with such a booking. I take that risk consciously and yes, I always read those small letters and I make a choice. But now, there is a world catastrophe, planes don't fly, boats don't sail, borders are closed and I have to say ""keep those few hundred euros, even if I can't come"". Moreover, the apartment is not even open. So putting it on Non Refund is very easy. To say, you can come next year, but just that date is easy too. If I can't, I simply can't. So then I have no choice. Now the owner nicely puts the money in his pocket. That's nice, right. A little thinking along, no, the nice owner does not. He could also say, I will deduct costs and you will get the rest back. Or you can come back next year, but indicate when you can. Would it be more expensive, I can pay extra. But no, these nice people, as you write, don't even respond anymore."
">> We booked in February, before the Corona virus started, Anthena Studios in Skiathos. >> We did this via booking.com and it was a so-called non-refund.The booking was cheaper as non refundable. I booked direct with accommodation for last October somewhere and could have got the same room for the same number of nights for abut €70 cheaper (total). I went for the more flexible option because non of us know what might happen. As it happens we went, it was great and will go back. But not likely non-flexible.I can see where the original poster is coming from. They can't go. But there are plenty of scenarios which might have meant they could not go and not get a refund apart from this SARS-CoV-2 virus. But if the accommodation is open but you can't get there it makes it more complicated and probably impossible for a refund.Have you tried to reschedule and hope for some good will?"
If you have a bought and paid for booking for 2020 but cannot get there but also an email with an offer to transfer the booking to 2021 but cannot make that date either why don’t you - donate the booking reference details to a friend/family or even a random stranger who can go... any takers?
If the accommodation is not open then you are due some kind of refund/credit note/ re-book and i would take this issue up with booking.com if the owners are trying to tell you anything different.The only caveat here is did you cancel the contract or have they cancelled because they are closed. The devil will be in these details and will affect what your ultimate outcome will be. Non-refundable only counts if you dont show or can't make it not the other way around if they are closed. If its open then you are at the mercy and goodwill of the owners as its non-refundable. That's why non-refundable accommodation room rates are less than refundable.Good luck and your not the only person in this kind of predicament at the moment.
#12...great informative post. I don't think this thread should be taken down as suggested in an earlier post because there is a lot of good info to be taken from it which may help other posters. I'm sure fair minded folk won't look on it as a slur on the accommodation but perhaps just a warning to be careful choosing your booking options.
why should it be taken down this C19 virus is an unprecendented event so I think it becomes a moral issue regarding repayments all this sticking up for the island is just weird its like ooo its the most perfect place on earth so biased
"I agree with 12. If the place isn't open, whether by Government decree or their own personal choice, then they should refund. End of. Let's say the hotel had a fire and had to close. I'm sure no-one would then say, oh you booked non-refundable so you can't have your money back.If the place is open then but OP can't travel there, that would be a different situation. But my understanding is that all seasonal accommodation is currently closed by the Government up until 15 June. So most if not all of OP's holiday would be when it is still closed."
"@ 10 yes I tried that. Unfortunately, good will is hard to find. I fully understand that this was completely unforeseen for both parties and that both parties are hindered by this. However, now I am the only one who is troubled. I have lost my money and they cannot deliver. The apartment is still closed. So a little settlement from their side would have been nice. I asked for a voucher, but they only do that for a week when it suits them. Unfortunately we cannot. Would they , you get a voucher and if it is more expensive in the period that you want to come, you pay extra. Then I had peace with it. But no, just don't respond and put the money in their pocket."
"@12 That's what I mean. Now I am called the bogeyman, while I have indicated that they can withhold costs or whatever. But unfortunately. I think it's bad to not respond, just put the money in your pocket and say, well you should have taken a extra guarantee. I'm sure many people buy a washing machine with no extra warranty, but if it breaks right after the warranty, they immediately complain that it needs to be repaired out of warranty. I find this fairly similar. If it was my fault I had no problem with it, too bad I took the gamble. But now there is so much that we cannot go and it is very easy from the accommodation to slide it on us. Let alone what booking.com does, just don't respond !!I'm sure some accomodation does the same, so beware!!!"
"The accommodation voucher is underwritten by the Greek Government, and should be offered as a credit against any stay in the same establishment. If you choose not to use it, it should be refunded automatically after 18 months. Ask booking.com for support on this.Cancelling before the hotel confirmed it would be unable to complete the transaction may be the problem. However, I think that would be unreasonable and booking.com would look into it.https:/…Edited: 4:23 am, June 02, 2020 "
brilliant post patricia bravo
"Ok so Jackyboy probably could have softened the comments about the owner but come on 99.9% of us who have booked non refundable or totally refundable accommodation would, given the circumstances, about “not getting there through no fault of his own” wanted something back.How I don’t know, maybe accept the weeks that are being offered and try to sell them on?? I don’t know Jackyboy but come on, apart from being a bit “ vociferous” in his comments ( bourne out of frustration) it could have happened to anyone who chanced their arm at non refundable. Personally I actually do not want to go on holiday when restrictions COULD dictate when I can swim, eat, bathe I’ll just wait until things get back to normal ThanksEdited: 7:25 am, June 02, 2020 "
"Today the owner canceled our booking, because now show ;-)) ( of course he kept the full amount)Let me tell you, it is no longer about the money, he can put it somewhere... that I do not mention the name of. But it's about the way he treats people and their money. I want people to know and be warned. I have a claim with the insurance. But it's just wrong what they do. They may have done that for multiple bookings!"
You went for the cheapest option and on this occasion it didn't work out.Get over it and don't try to blame anyone else.
Ditto!
"@ 22, you can put it that way, but I see the post below ""Easyjet flight return"" from you in another post:So uhmmm ... you are the first one to ask for the money back ;-))))""3. Spiderdog Re: Easyjet flight returnMay 26, 2020, 8:12 AMSaveOver the weekend, we received confirmation that our flights had been canceled by easyjet before the beginning of June.Chose a refund and we were told the payment would be refunded to us within 28 days.We will see!Also got flights for September, so I wonder what will happen next? "")"
Mhhh ... even the mail removed
"Yes. Chose the refund option on a full price flight.Did not expect return of payment on a non refundable booking option. What part of "" non refundable"" don't you understand?"
I tought you had a full refund through your insurance @jackyboy1969 so why you keep moaning about it.
I tought I taw a puddy tat? Only joking nicksy
"Anthena studios without doubt one of the best in skiathos, fantastic family will do everything to help you, I know two couples that had emergency health issues and anthena were so helpful, people have already moved to next year’s holiday at no cost from anthena"
"Yes, that was a stupid typo from my part david"
Anyone stayed here recently? Booked to stay soon and really looking forward to our first visit to the island.Cheers
"We are staying at Anthena Studios for 11 nights from 9th September This will be our 3rd time with them, great studios in a brilliant spot just off the main street so,no noise The place is spotless and the owners Stavros and Rania are lovely people and Ranias English is superb EnjoyEdited: 5:26 am, August 11, 2020 "
Brilliant... cheers Paul F
"#31 it’s the place we always try to get booked into not always possible as it has only eleven rooms.. Not been though for two years now. As has been said, great location for the town and harbours, walking distance to Megali Ammos beach. Spotlessly clean. Spacious rooms and modern decor.You’re in for a treat."
Great... cheers Gary
We’re staying here now. Great choice. Lovely people and central but quiet.
