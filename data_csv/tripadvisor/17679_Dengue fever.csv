I'm considering a last-minute trip to St. Thomas (late-March) and am aware that Puerto Rico health officials declared a Dengue fever epidemic last week. Does anyone know if there are elevated infection rates on St. Thomas as well?
Do a search above. There is a recent post from someone who just return from STJ.
well....now that just sounds great!
I've been here more than 2 decades & have never gotten dengue. You'll be fine.
"Sorry STT Thomas S:Didn't mean to suggest ""stay away"". I had never heard of it and we are going back for our 18th trip to STJ next month. I'm a bug magnet, but nothing will keep me away!!Edited: 10 years ago "
"Dengue comes and goes across the Caribbean. Best bet is to avoid the beach, the forested areas, etc. during the peak mosquito hours -- primarily late afternoon/early evening. If you have a ceiling fan, keep it on when you're sleeping. And, if you're especially prone to bites, use repellent. Dengue is no fun and some forms of it can be very serious, but the chance of getting it from a short visit is rare. It's not something I would worry about, but I would take precautions."
