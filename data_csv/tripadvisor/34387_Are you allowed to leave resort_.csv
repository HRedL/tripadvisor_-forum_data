"We are going to stay on the Cliffs in August and were told visitors from any state can't leave the resort. To those in Negril right now, are you finding that to be true? Typically we go to Alfred's/the beach a few days...also, has anyone been at any restaurants? We usually go to Presley's, Xtabi, etc. a few times. Thanks in advance!"
"Based on an MOH Press Release from yesterday, right now guests are required to stay on their hotel property for their entire stay.That might change by the time you travel in August. Download the jamcovid app to stay up to date with any changes in policies and procedures,"
"I’ve watched live videos in Negril and people are moving around.Live music fundraisers for local musicians are happening, Restaurants, book a Tiki cruise. Negril looks chill & safeTho with no more testing in the airport I remain concerned with travelers from the USAPEACE!Edited: 2:42 pm, July 19, 2020 "
"Busgirl, a friend of mine told me today the concern is the same in the USVI. I am concerned by the disregard by fellow Americans. We are still under ‘do not travel’ advisory so I am baffled by those from the US going anywhere right now."
"Can you provide a link to where it says this? I'm looking everywhere amd can't find it, but have read a lot of first hand reports that people need to stay on property."
"Can't find the link right now - someone posted it here in one of the recent threads.Bushgrl apparently and with the tacit encouragement from another site, people are not abiding by the stay on property requirement...or much other than that. Some are, I hope many and most are. I've seen the same videos from Bourbon Beach, sounds like a place to avoid at all costs.""I am concerned by the disregard by fellow Americans. We are still under ‘do not travel’ advisory so I am baffled by those from the US going anywhere right now.""Everyone has their reasons for traveling that are their own....don't be ""baffled"".As far as state department advisories, I never paid attention to them or I might never have gone to Jamaica. There are some countries who are requiring (not advising) their people not to travel to certain places, the US included. We are the bone-heads of the planet and we have cooties."
"Thank you...I'm on a few Couples forums and the current guests feel that, if I can get a cab and it's open, it's ok, as long as it's in the tourist corridor. Meanwhile, Sandals is being restrictive. People have 0 regard for the locals health."
Thanks all~ my husband and I love Negril and are frequent visitors; we were even married there! I was simply trying to get a feel in advance. Will absolutely be mindful and follow rules. Appreciate the responses. Stay well!
"Rasta is exactly right, there are others who are openly encouraging people to ""Come On Down"" to Negril where the ""Who cares what the guidelines are"" mentality is prevalent on their posting!!Although I understand how desperately Negril businesses need revenue I do hope that many of the small property owners there are holding their guests accountable. If the rules and protocol is that guests stay at their property then until that changes that's the deal.Edited: 2:30 pm, July 24, 2020 "
"I think that site is now holding their hands up to being confused about what the stay in zone order actually meansEven doing a google search you can find instructions from Holness and the visit Jamaica site which states stay in hotel for first 48 hours then move to freedom of movement around the tourism corridorThen there is conflicting info that states stay in your hotelI think that this is why guests are moving around in the tourist areas, depends on which info you have read.It needs clarifying soon"
"Its up to all of us individually , to stop this.The fact that US is bringing the virus to Jamaica, means nothing good for Jamaica.It's not going to help get tourism back.Canada is the second biggest tourist money , oops I mean was:(We closed our borders, to US.We are to expect a sight based on tourism is supposed to be our moral compass?How in the world can getting on a plane from the biggest corona outbreak in the world, sound like the right thing to do?Does any body watch the news?"
"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/aft…The article states ""The government is currently processing a backlog of ten thousand coronavirus tests. The health ministry claims that all specimens will be analyzed by the end of the month""So could it be that initially they planned on being able to let tourists leave the resort after the results came back negative. But now with the backup results are not in-and its changed to not leaving your hotel."
"They said on the plane and in customs that we are all limited to our resorts. The excursions aren’t open anyway, they got shut down. You can do water sports, including parasailing is all I’ve found but there is a guy on the beach offering Blue Hole and a ganja plantation tour with Rick’s. I don’t know if that means it is OK though.Edited: 8:57 pm, July 24, 2020 "
"islandlorna2,You're right again!! ""Does any body watch the news?"" Great question, I guess it depends on which ""news"" you watch!!! As I hope that you understand the chaos that exists in America at the moment!! It is beyond belief and it is far stranger than fiction!!""Are you allowed to leave resort?"" Who the F knows? Depends on which news you watch!!!"
"I'm not watching the news. I told you first hand information. There is no ""who knows"". I know current information from first hand experience.Edited: 7:32 am, July 25, 2020 "
"Island loreal and anyone else saying we are bringing the virus: In talking to others, a lot of people isolated. I myself quarantined 2 weeks except to get tested. It is possible to travel with good conscience. Should we have done it? Ithought so because i've beentaking every precaution and the hotel where I am at is doing a great job with sanitization. Anyway, this was a damned if you go, damned if you don't go, tripEdited: 7:43 am, July 25, 2020 "
"But unfortunately it was the Jamaican people who were damned if you go and damned if you don’t goEven if you quarantined for two weeks before you went like you indicate, that actually means you didn’t go out anywhere or have any contact with anyone you wasn’t travelling with and that means they were also doing the same.You then had to travel through at least two airports and sit on a plane for a number of hoursIf you have convinced yourself that this was without risk then I think you may be misinformed The reality is that you and many others chose to go, you accepted the risks and it is what it is. Stand by your decision by all means but I don’t think it’s right to be defensive about itAnd of course all those workers will have been overjoyed at sanitising all day to make you all safer. You don’t say if you wore masks in all public areas, as sanitising alone would be ineffective. Masks would help protect those workers and their families.Choosing to go on a non essential trip in a global pandemic from a country who does not have the virus under control is only meeting that individual travellers needs, no one can truly say they are travelling anywhere to help a country’s people or economy. It’s just about being honest with yourself ."
"Lisa, I understand that you did your best to minimize the risk. Unfortunately, the only way to ELIMINATE the risk of further spreading the virus around is to stay home. That's it. There is only so much that you can do to reduce risk while traveling through airports, and on planes. Studies show about an 80% reduced risk of transmission if everyone wears a mask. That's very good, and what we should be doing in our day to day lives at HOME. But 80% is not 100%. Even testing is not 100%. As should be evident by the 20 some odd new (identified so far) cases since opening, traveling will spread the virus further. It's just reality. The ONLY WAY to beat this thing is for everyone to do their part, and stay home."
Lisa - Thanks for the information. I appreciate how you traveled conscientiously.
"the only way to travel conscientiously right now is to eliminate any non-essential travel. vacation travel counts as non-essential travel.Edited: 11:02 am, July 25, 2020 "
"My husband and I just returned from a wonderful week in Negril. We flew in from Baltimore ( not our originating flight) and we not tested. We did a screening and were out of the airport in less than an hour. We were told not to leave our resort and we did not. We used the same driver that we’ve had the past 4 years and he followed safety protocols. We were free to walk the beach and move around the resort. We felt VERY safe there and their protocols were top notch! We met guests that had flown in from Texas and Florida ( connection flights, not states of origin) and they were all tested for Covid. They told us they were swabbed in both nostrils and throat. It took them about 3 hours to get through the airport procedures. We had a great experience in Negril and followed their safety policies. The workers at the resort made us feel very welcome! They were so friendly and it was great getting to know them. I look forward to returning again someday. This was our 6 th trip to Jamaica and 4 th time on Seven Mile Beach. I hope this helps answer some questions or concerns."
"Tourism is an industry that has to adapt just as all others do. There is no sign that this pandemic will end anytime soon, and the people of Jamaica need to generate revenue just like they do here in my touristy town in Michigan. Our area was relatively Covid free until the end of June when the tourists felt coming here was safer then Detroit. So now our numbers are rising, but hospitalizations are still flat. We adapt - masks, distancing, sanitation, common sense measures like reduced capacity. Studies show flying is relatively safe when masked as the air changes constantly. If you mask and sanitize at the airport after a negative test you aren’t bringing it in, except in super unlikely circumstances. We will test before our trip in October as required, and also do an antibody test. We will travel safely. We will stay on the resort this time. We will tip generously because we know the economy is hurting there. And yes, after working in medical clinics, home care and in general dealing with the stress of what will be 7 months by the time we get there we do need a vacation from taking care of our community (including some recovering cases). Stay home if it makes you feel better, I can respect that. I have already learned that there is risk in most things in life. All you can do is reduce it to a level you can personally accept."
Well said Dave! Peace
"A compelling argument for travelling Dave ACan I ask what studies you refer to on the safety of air travel, the only info I have seen is airline propaganda to bump start their business. You also contradict yourself with the coastal areas in your state having a spike in cases due to increased staycation travel. Well this is the risk a lot of us are worried about for Jamaica, who don’t have the testing capability , medical facilities or trained staff that Michigan hasThat along with increased risk of death from covid for people of colour and poverty and disadvantage may not mean ‘flat’ hospitalisation data there.Thank you for being an essential worker, but I am surprised you don’t have more of a concern for wider communities not just yourselg and your acceptance of risk, given what side of this pandemic you will have observed.I too am an essential worker and have had my first week off work this week since January. I have stayed home and relaxed with my family. we were due to travel to Jamaica in August for 2 weeks but chose to cancel for all the reasons I have already raised.The U.K. have taken Spain off our list of safe countries last night due to data received about a spike in their covid cases, which means U.K. people already there will have to quarantine for 2 weeks on their return and no flights there until the government says so.Jamaica should have the right to be as decisive and assertive and not feel that the tourism product is the head and shoulders of their country."
"Don’t let them troll you, Dave.Edited: 8:50 am, July 26, 2020 "
"To answer the question about plane travel. The CDC says ""Most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes."" A review of the scientific literature shows that on a flight, one is at a small risk of catching something only from those people within a few rows of you, but not from the entire plane (they have been doing studies based on tuberculosis patients for years.) It turns out that airplanes blow their air from above you and then off to the side, not from the front of the plane to the back, that way, the entire plane isn't exposed to one sick person. This makes a big difference on the statistics of contagion because your exposure is only to a dozen or so people around you, not the 100 or more on the flight. Of course, wearing a mask cuts that risk dramatically for your fellow passengers, some studies say by 80% and all airlines require masks. So, apparently, plane travel right now is relatively safe compared to time spent in the grocery store for example. Yes, there are reports of scofflaws who pull down their masks mid-flight, but you need to focus on the statistics and not panic about every individual infraction. If it is someone you see 6 rows away, quietly sitting in their seats, probably no harm done. If it is someone parading around leaning over people getting junk from their overhead bag, talk to a flight attendant, who has the power to ban the passenger from future flights if they don't comply.So, yes, scientifically, travelers who self quarantine before a trip are pretty benign to the world in general. Not zero risk, but very low risk.Now, two non-scientific remarks. First, I, like Tye, believe that Jamaica has the right to make their own travel rules. Unlike Tye, I mean it, and respect the rules that they have made, whereas he seems to think they have a right of self-determination only if they want to have rules that he approves of. Second, there is a lot of Canadian smugness on this forum. Given that the rates of infection in Canada are on a dramatic rise for the last few weeks, maybe a little less know-it-all declarations that the US is uniquely horrible would be in order. Like New York's Govenor Cuomo, who famously declared in March that New York wouldn't have troubles with the virus because they were smarter and ""tougher"" than the rest of the world, Canadians are demonstrating that containment is tricky and depends less on bold talk than on individual actions that in aggregate lead to reductions. Am I travelling these days, no, for a list of personal reasons, I rarely leave the house and yard at all. Is it possible to travel safely and responsibly? Yes, with proper precautions. Should I immediately assume that anyone who does something different than I do is stupid, selfish or both. No, to think that way would be stupid, selfish or both."
Im at Riu tropical and signed some type of stay at the resort document that applies to the dates 7/1/-7/14 I’ve left the resort twice. I have a rental car. No one seems to care or say a word. I’m traveling alone. There’s not many people here. Everything seems real laxef but you have to wear a mask to order a drink and when entering the dining area and gift shop.
The answer to that is not for 14 days: https:/…Hotel
"that's great, jon. you are a shining example for all in these difficult times. your family should be proud."
TripAdvisor should think about changing some rules. Only one post per topic should be allowed. This forum is for travelers to get answers to questions regarding travel. You might not always agree with other responses but don’t tell us about it. Some want to continue with their opinions over and over. We heard you the first time. None of us are perfect so get over it. Stay home in your bubble and zip up and tweet away.There are other places for your “ideas and thoughts” Peace
"I believe the OP asked if it was okay to leave the resort, not your personal opinion on travel. They’re adults capable of making their own decisions - they don’t need anybody else’s opinion to travel. If you want to stay home, stay home. If you know the answer to their question, by all means answer. Nobody wants to hear people’s personal opinion as to whether they should travel or stay home. If they wanted that, they would ask for it."
"Jon you are full of sh:t and chat even more sh:t. We are under a government mandate to wear masks in public and we do. Don’t lie to these people when you have zero idea what is happening in this island. People are being fined for not wearing their masks in public and you won’t be allowed to enter ANY business with out a maskThankfully it looks like many people on this site can see right through you.Edited: 6:24 am, July 29, 2020 "
"The workers in the stores I’ve been in don’t have a mask on, or is around their neck and not their face. Some stores have people at the door with hand sanitizer but I know what I see happening personally. Claim I’m full of “sh*t” all you want but I’ll provide photographic proof if necessary. NONE of the merchants on the beach have on masks just employees at the resort"
"Jon: go ahead post those pics (They’ll be staged anyway) ... you’re full of crap. I live here, masks are worn in public."
"Jon j, you signed paperwork to promise that you wouldn't leave your resort, and then brag about leaving your resort? Do you always disregard your promises and commitments. Do you dine&dash, shoplift, cheat on your taxes, call in sick when your not, go on to web forums and make stuff up? Just curious where you draw the line about honor."
"""Less people have died of Covid 19 than influenza kills each year.""That is of course a blatant lie. CDC estimates that about 34,000 died of influenza in the 18-19 season. And that's a projected number that assumes more deaths than are actually reported.Thus far 150,000 have died of COVID in the US this year and that number will almost certainly exceed 250,000 by the end of the year. And these number represent actual reported deaths. Using the same projection methodology CDC uses for influenza, the numbers would be significantly larger."
@electrical engineer.....bravo!!!! Well said!!!!!
Electrical engineer Not sure why you feel that I believe Jamaica has the right to self determination if it’s in agreement with my opinion.The difference between me and you is that I see Jamaica as a country rather than a holiday destination.And believe you me Jamaicans not employed in tourism products (who are the majority) would prefer the borders closed for now and are very worried about tourists floating about.
I so agree Tye:)Appreciate u
"Thanks, all! Very informative. I was asking so we DO follow rules, not so we can avoid. Just trying to get prepared as I am finding the websites to be confusing/conflicting. Thanks for all of the ""real time"" information."
"Hi Cara,Phase 2 for opening ends 7/31 so make sure you are watching the Visit Jamaica website to see if there are any changes in protocol."
"""The workers in the stores I’ve been in don’t have a mask on, or is around their neck and not their face.""Which stores? My friends that live there and shop in the local markets say ALL are wearing masks (patrons and staff) and in some stores you MUST hand sanitize before you enter."
"Tye,You said ""Jamaica should have the right to be as decisive and assertive and not feel that the tourism product is the head and shoulders of their country."" Which I took to mean that you want Jamaica to be forceful and assertive in making and enforcing rules that you want. But apparently you don't give them the respect to consider that they are a democracy and will make the rules that they want, and are constantly belittling the rules they have chosen.Not sure why you think I believe Jamaica is a tourist destination rather than an country. I guess you were just grasping for something derogatory to say about me. Everything I have said aligns just the opposite. I always encourage visitors to get out of the AI bubble and follow the local rules and customs.The Jamaican citizens and voters are real people who think and read and make choices in difficult times with the best of intentions for their families and loved ones. They are not children requiring your intervention on their behalf. They may make decisions that don't work out from time to time and then they will make corrections and adjustments, just like grown-up people in other places."
"Hey you don’t have to tell me anything about Jamaica , EE when my family largely still live thereYou have just got carried away with your own interpretation of what I saidI am just going to let you think what you think you know"

"<< ,You sign a digital document stating you won’t leave resort. >. << As long as you are not tracked, I think it might be okay. >>I guess your name and word is mud then, right ?"
"Robin: you are tracked: how do you think two tourists, not traveling together, got caught railing around the island? They were both arrested and move them likely isolated in a govt facility and deported. How hard is it for you or anyone else to follow the bloody rules??"
"I agree- don't break th he rules. You are fortunate enough to be there. Another country was kind enough to let you in. I dont support encouraging others to break the law. From what I just read you dont want to end up on National Geographics ""Locked up abroad"". Does not look to be fun. Appreciate that you are there at all"
WT* - Have some people lost all of their common senses!! I am completely dumbfounded that there are people who are so entitled that they think a countries rules don't apply to them. These must be the same people that think you get less oxygen when you wear a mask. UGH!
"Just read over on the Negril.com that the host of that site states that there are many tourists around in bars restaurants and excursion spots, that they are sticking to the stay in zone but not stay in hotel/resort. stating that it Seems to be accepted by locals and business owners and that locals aren’t aware that tourists should be staying in hotel/ resort and are welcoming them as normalSentiment feels like they are signalling this is okYes there is confusion over the protocols but just smh at this information.Edited: 3:34 pm, July 29, 2020 "

You must download the app which is called JamCOVID19 on to your cell and tracking always must be on . They also may randomly call as well as video call - the part of deal you agree to if your going to come into the country from foreign .
It is their money and their vacation. You got them there. They are on the island and living the event. Your job is doneDon’t need any of the shaming or bullying because of your beliefs and opinions Call me names. I don’t careI have the same voice as you Peace
What if I don’t have a phone or for that matter want one? I’m on vacation Peace

"negril1994, your posts on drugs, prostitution, and shootings, etc will continue to get deleted since they are not specific instances that involve tourists.

Come on guys this is suppose to be a travel site . Credibility doesn’t increase with repeated posts. A person asked a question. They didn’t ask for repeated grown adults arguing.
"honeybear63043, You are absolutely correct!! ""Re: Are you allowed to leave resort?"" The answer to the question by virtue of Jamaica's published declarations in NO......As such any tourist who is in Jamaica at this time and disagrees with this edict and violates it is breaking JA rules / law. Although as difficult as it may be to enforce it was implemented in an attempt to prevent the transmission of Covid 19 on the island. So far it has been quite successful!!Using this forum as a platform for personal discourse is wrong and unacceptable."

"Yes same here TIMMMAAY, lot's to talk about, photo's, video going back a long way. Life was far different in JA before guns and drugs... I still like going up in the Blue Mountains to spend time with some old friends and live a simple life."
"My experience in JA doesn't go nearly as deep as yours. I'm just your standard issue tourist, just enjoy getting outside of the typical tourist towns as much as possible. I've always traveled with my wife, so have always been a bit more ""on guard"" than I would had I been traveling solo, which limits what/where we would go. Things are very different there now (as you know) than 20-30 years ago. We only started visiting in the early 2000's."
"Is Jamaica Safe? (INSIDER Tips for 2020)https:/…I have been going Jamaica for 20 years. We rent scooters, walk the beach, cliff road etc. Last year we went to Port Antonio. Rented a car. Are we careful-yes. Are we aware of our surroundings-yes. Do we walk at night-no. These also apply to myself when I am home. No matter where you are in the world crime exists. Dont be foolish and make yourself a target. In my opinion you dont need to stay on a resort. That has been said for YEARS.Stated in the article""The tourist areas of Jamaica tend to be very safe and beautiful places to stay in. Crimes against tourists have been decreasing and loads of people go and have an awesome time, and so should you!""Let's not be fear mongers. Is there crime-yes. But you CAN and I WILL continue to safely travel in Jamaica. Its beautiful and it's people beautiful. And it is a destination that can be visited safely."
"81 John.. I can tell you wants happens. You’re taken to a govt quarantine facility, that you pay for, you’re tested for the virus, and sent home if it’s negative and kept in quarantine if it’s positive. And possibly put on a travel ban. I read yesterday that the govt is looking to monitor social media pictures to find violators I already mentioned the two tourists who were arrested for violating the order. They didn’t just leave the property, they went to the other side of the island."
"Iriestar, thanks for your concise answer about those who circumvent the laws and protocols put in place by the Jamaica Govt. I've read some articles from JA, and you can't always believe what you read, that say that JA military has assigned dozens of ""Wardens"" to monitor the resorts and roadway's on the island to assure compliance to the protocols.These articles have comment sections and I was somewhat surprised by what some Jamaicans commented. Many are very afraid and unhappy about opening up the island to tourism especially from the US. Some demanded fines and imprisonment for tourists apprehended for their conduct. That two tourists were caught across the island isn't surprising.Irie you may or may not be aware of (and I won't mention names as to not drive any clicks there) a person out of Negril who is encouraging tourists to brake the rules of the protocols by not staying on their resorts / hotels/ villas property within the designated zone. As a matter of fact he boasts that everybody knows what's going on in Negril and nobody cares. Perhaps he should be reported to the authorities for his inciting civil disobedience???"
"John.. I know who you’re referring to and boy it would be nice to send a little message to the powers that be . But they will get caught.., not if, but when. Jamaica is taking this quarantine stuff very seriously and I suggest every one coming to the island does the same."
"Irie, I bet he has his bags packed as we speak and any signs of a pandemic in Negril he's on the first flight out."
Hopefully he’ll get a formal escort

"I think this was said alreadySeriously forum members I think there is a person here who is dealing with something, as this has become very Irrational and fixated It is probably better to start another thread as this sustained campaign has swamped the ops post"
"Iriestar have you got that correct as I really don’t think that tourists in the hotels are required to download and register on the jamcovid app. The app is for authorisation of returning residents and track and trace for Jamaicans visiting home. It is also for tourists not staying in hotels, but private dwellings including villas and rentals Visit Jamaica is for tourist authorisations and processes.That is my understanding , so general joe tourist in the riu or sandals is not being tracked or have to check in through the app"
Hamster wheels and alcohol never did anyone any good
"Tye: yes, tourists are being tracked. GPS, phones and or video calls. I don’t doubt people are out and about, but it won’t last. MoH isn’t stupid... they’ll get caught.You might want to add some ganja with ratbat sh*t to last comment."

rasta you're right! I guess wishful thinking on my part. You know better than I about the current scene in Negril. I guess what pi**es me off the most is people trying to personally profit off others safety.I would guess your family and friends are fully aware of the BS games being played. AS I have said all along is if there is an out brake in Jamaica especially Negril there will be no way to contain it. The healthcare system is just too frail!!Those who brought it with them to Jamaica will just fly home to wherever and the majority of Jamaicans left behind will be screwed!! Let's collectively pray that doesn't happen!!
"Hopefully this well help... “Tourists staying in the resilient corridor – that is, travellers for tourism deemed to be high-risk, either based on countries visited or based on health screening, will be required to do a PCR test as well, and be quarantined in their hotel until the results are available.“If tested negative, then the stay-in-zone Order applies, whereby tourists are required to [remain] on the property for the duration of their stay. The tourist will be allowed to visit attractions within the resilient corridor,” the Prime Minister explained.https:/…"
"Maybe I am not awake enough and my coffee has not done the trick..but does this say two different things? 1. If tested negative, then the stay-in-zone Order applies, whereby tourists are required to [remain] on the property for the duration of their stay. 2. The tourist will be allowed to visit attractions within the resilient corridor,” the Prime Minister explained."
I read that multiple times yesterday and felt it gave two conflicting orders. No wonder there is confusion.
Here is the source quoted by post #108.https:/…
Also I would feel that the term attractions needs defining
Some might call Ricks or Margaritaville attractions. Just sayin....
"My wife is an attraction for me, but I don't think I want others visiting her. Just saying."
NeedBlueWater #113 - Hahaha. It's nice to have a lighthearted post here!
"Well,  It is all to much confusion.... Some are following rules, some are bending, and some are all out breaking the rules, with a i do not care attitude...This is a LOT of the governments fault. For instance, there is a planned DJ PARTY today , ( AND NIGHT )... with music, dancing, eat, and drinks.... at the Westender resort......I bet there will be lots of social distancing, and mask wearing there..... NOT ! ...."
"I would consider them to be, but the fact still remains that the PM, himself, has been quoted saying that tourists would be allowed to visit attractions in the Resilient Corridor. Those are his words...not speculation, so you tell me?"

I dont believe that those in these conversations are either. However I am aware, I am washing my hands etc etc and following the protocol/guidelines that I should be. Not even for myself but others. The protocols put into place by Jamaica should be followed as they are put forth to protect their citizens and country as a whole. To keep the cases managable and traceable. The FEAR that Covid could easily catch fire and devistate the country is legit."
Craig S - you are quoting from old information. That was when the Jamaican government was testing everyone at the airport. They haven't done that in a month.
"Negril 1994 - I should have figured lol. I actually knew this guy very well when he was first starting this thing and living out of one of those ""hotels"".And that's all I'll say except that I'd encourage folks to make phone calls, emails and check websites and the jamcovid app daily instead of relying on one resident's ""educated guess"" on anything with this thing.One thing is for sure - if caught defying government protocol Jamaica will deport you at your expense and might not let you back in for several years."

"rastagirl, Thanks for trying to keep folks live and updated on the current and correct information on the ground in Jamaica!!As you well know from all your years in JA what a huge undertaking opening the island up to tourism has been.

"I tried to find this answer throughout the forum and couldn't....instead of posting a new thread I thought maybe someone here would know. TIA!I am staying on the cliffs side for my stay....no beach access. Is there a resort I can taxi to and use their beach and beach chairs/amenities? Traveling solo and I feel more comfortable, especially during the pandemic, to be somewhere safe where I know I can go in the ocean and leave my stuff attended to if that makes sense. I have never been so not sure how the beaches are here with safety.Any help is greatly appreciated! Otherwise I will start a new thread or search again.:)"
"Two places come to mind, both eateries/pubs: Sun Beach ( jamaicatravelandculture.com/destinations/wes… and https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Revie… ) It is close to CoCo LaPalm and next to Sandy Haven.And Tony's Hut, a small place next to Wavz Event Beach ( https://jefferyjames903.wixsite.com/website/single-post/2017/10/15/NEGRIL’S-BEST-KEPT-SECRET-TONY’S-HUT-IN-NEGRIL )"

"To everyone who has posted on this Topic with many diverse answers, comments, etc... regarding leaving the resort you might want to read the following recommendation dated 8/6/20 from the CDC (Level 3 Warning avoid Non Essential Travel) Although it isn't about leaving the resort but rather you shouldn't visit at this time!!https:/…coronavirus-jamaica"
piggybacking onto @john g's comment...here's a link to the CDC's map of covid-19 risk by country: https:/…map-and-travel-notices.html
Well the CDC advice supports concerns that many have expressed on hereAnd the map illustrates that the risk is high for a good part of the globeSo anyone still thinking non essential travel ie a holiday is without risks are probably never going to reach a point where they stop with the denial of the hole we are all in from the pandemic
"The report on this in the Jamaica Gleaner has a lot of comments from Jamaicans who can’t believe the level 3 warning from the US against travel to Jamaica because of the risk of Covid in the country, being the numbers of cases and deaths and management of the virus in the USRightly stated, most of the cases in Jamaica have been imported from the USAnother example of the government there looking outwards not inwards, which influences the attitudes and thoughts of some travellers"
"The warning from the CDC sickens me. This once respected institution has be shanghaied by DJT and is now his political tool. This warning is nothing short of racist - and could very well crash the economy of a developing island nation.Maybe DJT is jealous of the Honorable Andrew Holness? A true leader who is well aware of the health-care deficiencies in his country and acted firmly and quickly from the start. The re-opening of tourism is being handled extremely well and I understand that steps are being taken to clamp down on tourists NOT abiding by Jamaican protocols. That's why Jamaica's numbers are (relatively) low and ours in the US are through the roof with no end in sight.Phun Phact: The spikes of cases in Jamaica are the worst right now in Clarendon, specifically Sandy Bay - a non tourist area outside of the ""resilience corridor"". Sandy Bay has been locked down now and for the next two weeks (as they did in St. Catherine with the Cluster outbreak). Unified and decisive action - oh, how I miss that in a government.I don't take the CDC ""warning"" at all seriously just as I haven't taken State Department ""warnings"" seriously over the past 35 years of travel to Jamaica. You all can decide for yourselves but I suggest researching it thoroughly.Edited: 4:41 pm, August 08, 2020 "
"almost every single country in latin america, central america and the caribbean has a travel warning. i’ve received 8 step notifications today for the caribbean, central america and se asia. most are level 3 for covid-19. a few are level 4 for covid and kidnappings/robberies. there’s nothing really different from the usual notifications. you can take them seriously or take them with a huge grain of salt, like most folks do. but i don’t see how this impacts the cdc’s reputation."
"Usually those warnings come from the State Department - when the CDC issues a warning for health reasons it has been, in the past, for a VERY good reason.Sadly Redfield is a Trump sycophant - the CDC issues guidelines the White House sends them back because they are ""too tough"" and the CDC then revises them! That alone sinks their reputation - this does nothing to give them credibility.Knowing the numbers as we do in Jamaica and the strict protocols they have in place, we know this warning is BS. It is not at all surprising that there are different levels of warnings for all Central American and Caribbean countries - I will never forget his comment about all the ""SH"" countries and this plays right into that thinking."
"it does, but at this point in time, i’d rather they send out “super scary messages” that will avert neophyte travelers from booking their dream ai vacations. even though in places like jamaica, the majority of cases are coming from returnees as opposed to generic tourists, it’s best to keep traffic down. you know how to travel there and are planning on returning for a long-haul stay this fall. i know how to travel there and would go to haiti (where i have family) before i’d go to jamaica right now.a lot of people who post here don’t really know how to travel there and right now is the time for them to not try. regardless of the immediate politics behind it all, i have no problem with it if those cdc messages and alarmist step notifications are dissuading casual vacationers and package-trip aficionados from hitting up the region."

"That was a very generic and typical gov warning. ""The CDC says older adults, people with certain underlying medical conditions, and others at increased risk for severe illness should consider postponing all travel, including essential trips, to Jamaica."" I mean, thats common sense. Email from state dept also said"" Jamaica has resumed most transportation options, (including airport operations and re-opening of borders) and business operations. Other improved conditions have been reported within Jamaica. Visit the Embassy's COVID-19 page for more information on COVID-19 in Jamaica.email also listed the usual towns and parts of cities to avoid. These are places most travelers would not go to. The US is pro Jamaica tourism and has a vested interest in gov bailed out US airlines doing well."
Many of the resorts are offering excursions and activities off the resort...So would that also be something a US tourist should avoid? Such as horseback riding or catamaran boat ride?

"Yes, cebakes, you are correctFor more information go to the ministry of health and wellness website and watch their most current video covering the protocols"
"Iriestar, good advice to all.. It is impossible to keep up with all the versions of the protocols and opinions floating around. Best to go to the horses mouth!!In reading the Gleaner and Observer lately it seems that the dozen or so new cases of COVID every day in JA are not specifically in the Resilient Corridor and not in Westmorland and Hanover which is great news for Negril. It seems by the available news that things are being handled well. Maybe you being on the ground you see things differently??"
"A lot of information floating around this thread, as well as the fluidity of the ever changing government regulations, coupled by what is actually being enforced adds a lot of confusion to the situation. I am back from a short stay and will provide some insight into what I observed and experienced first hand as an American traveler. YMMVAs of my arrival 11 days ago you needed a COVID test if you resided in one of four states. Other states were optional and since I did not want to be ""that person"" I elected to have a rapid covid test my day before departure. Interestingly enough, I used a driver well known to regular visitors and he was under the impression that all arrivals were required to show a negative Covid test. When I shared with him that was not the case he was shocked. I also explained you had a 7 day window to take the test and a lot could happen in 7 days. All US airlines require a mask to be worn in the airport as well as once onboard. You can remove it to eat or drink, and I observed numerous tourist taking advantage of this and keeping their mask off for extended periods of time. The airline lounge I used in Miami both outbound and inbound operated the same way, though they did a great job of social distancing, cleaning between customers, and only serving prepackaged food and drinks upon request. On arrival expect a longer line than usual. Club Mobay helped a little bit, but not as much as normal times. Each person's temp is taken and written on a piece of paper. You hold onto this until you get your individual interview, which happens right before you hit immigration. The interview is the basic questions you answer on your pre-clearance. It took maybe a minute and they give you contact information to self report in case you start showing symptoms. You are only required to download the tracking app if you are staying at a private property. Since I was not, I was not required and I will mention that no proof was required to validate where I was staying. Up to this point I should add that I was asked to use hand sanitizer twice.Immigration and customs was no different than previous trips and I was out in about 45-60 minutes using Club Mobay. I was reminded to stay within the approved corridor with no mention of staying on property 24/7. The ride to Negril was the same outside of maybe an extra check point or two. Negril was a bit slower that usual, especially since it was the same time as Dream weekend of years past. I left the property twice my entire visit and received no hassle or weird looks. From the locals I did talk to, most were anxious to get some tourist back and are worried they will miss out on high season. Mask wearing amongst locals was hit and miss, with a rough guess of about 10% while they were out and about. I hear most businesses require them, though I did not enter any so I cannot validate. I also heard the talk about authorities looking at social media to find those who could not play by the rules. The place I like to stay at on the West End was offering 50% off and I believe max occupancy was around 25% during my stay. It was the slowest I have seen Negril in all my years of going, however you did see some activity on the water. Ricks's appeared to be going full swing and the catamaran's were out with boats roughly 50% of usual capacity. Using a couple of delivery services I was able to secure anything and everything and had an incredibly relaxing time. Would I go again? I would with the right precautions. Get a rapid covid test, wear your mask throughout your journey, social distance, practice good hygiene. The country of Jamaica has handled this incredibly well so far and my fear is some careless tourist will diminish their efforts. Hope this helps."
"As of todays date -Aug 13th - I received email back from JTB stating tourists must stay at one resort during their stay.No multiple hotel locations or moving about the corridor.I wasn't planning on going to any ""attractions"" .But was planning on staying at diffrent places within the corridor.. Of course this is all fluid and can change from day to day.."
"I received a similar email today from the JTB!! Visitors are ""not allowed to leave their accommodation...they will be required to stay on property for duration of their stay."" I had inquired about leaving MBJ hotel for a villa which was not listed as an approved property on their site. I wonder if this includes leaving to dine out or grocery shop?"
Stay on resort means stay on resort. It does not say stay on resort except to go shopping or go out to eat or any other movement you can think of.You yourself typed the response from the JTB Visitors are not allowed to leave their accommodation...
"My advice,  Get a driver to be your beckon call guy, pick up at airport, run in mega mart and shop for supplies, bring you food to your resort, , and other things you might want.. i have a great driver, trustworthy, honest and dependable if you would like the info.......it is very slow, many will appreciate the chance to make more dollars ...!!"
"This may be the reason USA has a problem, do we really need rules to know w hats right?The majority of Americans are wonderful , but your infecting Jamaica.Some travellers don't really care.I'm thinking of how I'll get back and see the people I love .It's not pretty that Jamaicans can't go to there own beaches, because 25% of the worlds pandemic won't stay home, during summer.Your not supposed to leave your resort, but let's face it most of you don't give. A S hit"
"islandlorna2, I agree with most everything you say but I think that many times you group us Americans together unfairly. I know you say ""The majority of Americans are wonderful"" but the reality is any tourist American, Canadian, European is likely to not follow the rules especially in Negril by virtue of the setup and past experience there. No excuse I know it, not defending it, simply stating that many can't resist temptation as we all know so well. Human nature is to blame!!Although I would never visit Jamaica at this time for many reasons the island has opened for business so those who choose to visit regardless of nationality can do so. If COVID goes wild in JA then the government and those who spread the virus are to blame.I think the world of Canada and it's people especially you gals so this isn't some rant on Canada, but you have the disease too. Most rational Americans are trying to do the right thing throughout the pandemic here and the great majority are worried sick by all that is going on down here but most of us do give a sh*t"
"I don't know what rant the previous poster went on that TA had to remove, but it is a forum to inquire about travel information. In any case I won't be moving forward with booking a trip to Jamaica at this time due to these restrictions."
"""I had inquired about leaving MBJ hotel for a villa which was not listed as an approved property on their site. I wonder if this includes leaving to dine out or grocery shop?""As of today's protocol you will have to pick one place to stay - and stay there.If the Villa is not ""approved"" you won't be allowed to stay there regardless."
"John if I saw posts from Canada, going on foolish trips to Jamaica I'd call them out .I think most sensible people from all over the world wouldn't sacrifice a third world Country for a summer trip.My friends in Jamaica are pretty conservative , they wouldn't fly to any other country with a disease.They are judging most coming are being selfish Again my daughter and about 20 other family members live in your beautiful country I hope I can return to.Let's start with masks"
"john g thank you for your words, I hope you understand I love your country just not her actions right now"

I am here right now and there seems to be some confusion around 7mile beach being open or closed if you want to visit and are not staying at one of their resorts (I’m at Spa Retreat). They are looking into where I can go now because I wanted to get to the beach today :)So far everyone is super safe and following protocols.
"Included in the new protocols , is not being able to have two hotel, no split stays, so you cannot stay in a beach resort, then go to the cliffs for a different part of your stay. The main beach, 7 mile, in front of all the resorts, is open , but technically, if one is staying at the cliffs, you are suppose to stay put. If folks want to beach it, I would suggest to get a place right on the beach."
Treehouse is $10/ person with Covid protocols
"""Treehouse is $10/ person with Covid protocols""But with the reinstated ""stay at your hotel property"" protocols, no one can do this, right?"
"Right, what do people not understand about ""stay in your resort""? Sorry but this is getting tiresome."
Gail should know better.
It doesn’t seem the “must stay at your resort” is being followed by guests or the resort staff/drivers. But that’s just my POV.
"jenner,  Which is exactly why they have now tightened up protocols, some ruining it for all, just like here in the good ol USA."
"Maybe - just MAYBE they will begin to require tourists to download the tracking app. And for those that want to get cute and leave their phones in their dressers while they galavant around town make phone calls once a day - no answer, well you get a visit from a nice person from immigration who will help you pack."
"AgainCould not be bothered with all of thatIt would not make for any sort of vacation , stuck in one place, tracked and monitoredCan see why they could get to thisBut what are tourists getting out of that experience It’s a lockdown in the sun,,,,,nah lol save your money for 2021We had some great weather during the U.K. lockdown.. didn’t change a thing about being stuck in one place for days on end A gilded prison is still a prisonEdited: 3:24 pm, August 16, 2020 "
I am grateful for my situation there. Two weeks quarantine in my yard is awesome - being tracked for those two weeks - no problem....and then I'm free to go where I want (within the limitations set) for the next 10 weeks. For me - it's worth it.
"Tye: you are correct, but there’s a large number of people that come to Jamaica and never leave the resort. So for them, it’s not a problem."
"Hi, I read your question about being allowed to leave your resort. I can not believe why anyone would want to go away , when you are told you one must stay basically in your room and never leave the resort. I realize there is covid 19 but I think in time things will improve. Negril is a beautiful area. I used to explore Negril by foot and the odd taxi. Wait mon Wait"
"Hi, I love Negril and my late wife and I have been over forty times, staying at many lovely hotels. Yes you can sneak off the property but follow my advice. 1. Wait until the guard is asleep 2. Organize a taxi ahead of time but have him park down the street. 3. Try to wear black clothes so you blend in with the darkness 4. Get back before sunrise as they change guards and have roll call. Sometimes they may come to your room and physically shake you and check off your name. Be careful and discreet. Do not mention to anyone of your plans. Good luck."
"Hi Tye , enjoyed your response. Why bother with all those hassles (going to Jam) when you can stay home and drink a few beers, catch some rays. My place even has a pool. I agree Wait unti 2021"
"Pablo:Nothing says you have to stay in your room - you can use the beach/cliff area, swim in the sea, enjoy the pool and whatever else your hotel has to offer. You just can't leave the property. Some people can manage a stay in place vacation, many do in ""normal"" times. But if anyone feels they can't do that or don't want to do that then yes, I agree they may want to wait until things ""normalize"". I'm pretty sure your post #193 was a joke. As far as ""sneaking"" off the property you don't have to go through all that since the hotel will probably not be posting armed guards around the ""borders"". But if you are being tracked you run the distinct risk of getting caught breaking the rules which will mean a fine and deportation."
"@rastaWhy would you think he was joking? I guess you can judge him? Know what he is thinking? Of course you can I forgot who you are.@pablo was correct. Many security guards are many things. Dealers, pimps, and most important an ear! They know all and it’s important for travelers to realize that. I have met several that are wonderful men and women but others that have different intentions. Money talks as discussed in a current forum discussion. Tip heavy and you become a mark.Enjoy safe travelPeace"
@rasta“But if you are being tracked you run the distinct risk of getting caught breaking the rules which will mean a fine and deportation.”OuchThat sounds awful. What kind of world would it be if we were tracked and hunted down? Miserable But you have all the politically correct responses don’t you.Peace
Grow up Negril. If you’re coming to the island now you agree to be tracked by the local health dept.; you sign the order while in the airport. Don’t want to be tracked? Don’t come to Jamaica. Several tourists and residents have been arrested for violating the order. Don’t feel the least bit sorry for them. Stop trying to stir the pot.... again
He was very clearly joking. I'm not surprised you didn't catch that from the context though.
"While it’s true that in Jamaica money can buy anything. It doesn’t buy loyalty. So that guard that your dropped a few bills on will turn on a dime when you point dingers at him. So go ahead and bribe the guard and lie to the govt that “he said it was ok”, you won’t hear a peep out of him. If you’re coming to Jamaica please follow the protocols in place.. not just for our safety, but for yourself also."
@iriestar “ Stop trying to stir the pot.... again”The pot is always being stirred on this forum. Simply look at the tipping post.I just happen to stir the pot in a different direction and several of you don’t like it!And it certainly didn’t look like Madonna was being tracked. From all the images I have seen her and her entourage were having no problem getting around and enjoying themselves. Peace
"No, it's that you're not a very good person. Just go away."
Hi Teme sorry I didn’t respond to you! Enjoy your day.Peace
"Negril... have you ever been to Tryall? It’s a large property and you’re assuming things.. again. Yes, you’re stirring pot..now stop and go find something productive to do. You don’t want to tracked? Great! Stay home."
"""Why would you think he was joking?""Because I pick up on subtle/cynical humor? Hey, I'm a born and bred New Yorker, that skill is part of my DNA, what can I say.There is nothing politically correct about visiting a foreign country and complying with their rules. When you visit Russia, you are stuck to your tour and guide pretty much the whole way through. When you visit Jamaica during a public health crisis you agree to be tracked, you agree to the rules and if you break them you agree to be fined and deported. Nobody is hunting anyone down. If this doesn't appeal to you, if you have a moral or philosophical objection to any of that no one is forcing you to go. Whenever you travel to a foreign country you implicitly agree to abide by their laws, Pandemic or not. If you get caught breaking those laws you receive consequences.I'm simply posting the realities of the situation for travel right now. I'm sorry you don't like them but that is your right as a red-blooded citizen of the world.How's that for a ""politically correct"" reply? LOL."
"""And it certainly didn’t look like Madonna was being tracked. From all the images I have seen her and her entourage were having no problem getting around and enjoying themselves.""And you know this because....1. You were part of her entourage?2. You were telepathically with her every step of her vacation?3. You read People Magazine?There is no reason to assume Madonna didn't have to go through the exact same protocols as anyone else visiting Jamaica at this time. And these types never leave their villas or resorts anyway."
"Rastagirl.  '' And these types never leave their villas or resorts anyway ''...exactly !!! ( you beat me to it )............They has a beautiful villa, i am assuming full time, around the clock security, food delivered, full stocked bar delivered, misc delivered and a full time chef. I am sure she also had to do the test...etc..."
"Yup.. she was on Tryall Property the whole time. She had Covid recently, but she still had to submit a negative test and travel authorization like everyone else."
"We just landed yesterday. Offically, if ypu are from the US, Mexico, DR, or Brazil, there is a 14 day stay on resort/hotel quarantine. If you are caught, you risk up to $1,000,000 in fines and up to 14 months in prison. When you land, you sign paperwork stating you understand this. Tour operators are not in operation, and We were told by Island Routes that any travel off resort would be by taxi and ""at your own risk."" After consulting with our travel agent, we decided to stay on resort. Apparently she has had several clients get caught for breaking Jamaican laws, and the justice system is pretty hard core."
"Benjamin - as I understand the policy from the Visit Jamaica and MOH websites it doesn't matter where you are from, you are relegated to your hotel for your entire stay. I'm not sure why you'd even consult with your travel agent about possibly breaking the law in Jamaica at this time? Glad they talked some sense into you. Enjoy your vacation."
Benjamin were you surprised that you had to stay on the resort property? I suspect you were and that is why you confirmed with the travel agent. If that is the case you should have been made aware before travel if you booked everything with them. Thanks for sharing your experience.
Benjamin: this has been common knowledge for a little while now; it’s not new and I’m not sure you’re acting so surprised by this. Didn’t you do your own research or did you expect your TA do that for you? Didn’t you read the website when you uploaded your test and applied for you authorization?Thank you for confirming what I’ve been say on g: people are being tracked and they are being arrested and held accountable.
"Apparently, the rules had changed over the weekend, right after we submitted out entry applications. We were surprised, but what can you do? The resort is lovely and everyone is making the best of it."
"Benjamin..Thank you for on the ground confirming what many of us have said. While I will be waiting awhile, i can definitely see the huge appeal of getting away from the US right now. I would much rather be staring out at the beautiful sea, feeling the breezes, sipping a rum drink, and catching a nice tan, and enjoying some jerk chicken, than be here, with the over the top stressful politics, and of course the virus !!! Hope you are enjoying good nights sleep, with the tree frogs !! :)"
jamaicaobserver.com/front-page/…Update to the resilient corridor situation. Seems as it has been reversed due to pushback
Fast turning into poppy show
"Bk i saw that and it really irks me. I understand the spike in cases are from returning residents but if they allow tourists to venture out, we’re going to end with a lot more cases all over the island.. not just in one particular area. I also understand the need to make an income for bus drivers and attractions etc. but at what cost? Sigh. We cannot close the borders.. that’s just not realistic.. too many people depend on tourist dollars. I just ask that those who do visit, please follow the protocols, please wear your mask and kee your hands clean."
"But the article makes a correct reflectionThere has to be a balance as people will stop coming to Jamaica, simpleMost people like to venture out to shops and excursions at the very leastI am not a supporter of anyone travelling right nowBut Jamaica have to consider their tourist product if they are wanting tourists to pay their cash moneyFlip flopping on the protocols in short time is gonna confuse and frustrate travellers and gives the impression they don’t know what they are doing"
