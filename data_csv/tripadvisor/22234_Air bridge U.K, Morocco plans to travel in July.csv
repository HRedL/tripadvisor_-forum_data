"Hello, At the moment the FCO advises against non essential travel to Morrocco. Has anyone got plans to go if the air bridge is in place? I really want to book but understand that travel insurance will be void if the air bridge is not in place. What is it like regarding covid in Marrakech? Thanks in advance for any advice. Cheers"
"You won't be travelling to Morocco in July, especially not Marrakech.Check out the main Covid-19 thread, post #247 onwards, https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29373…"
I'm still hopeful there will be flights to Morocco in July - but I wouldn't book anything until there is an official announcementMarrakech has low virus numbers compared to UK cities but still high for Morocco at the moment
Thanks Tim for your help. I have looked at the links and there is some much information. It's hard to break it down with the zones etc. Is Marrakech in lockdown? I'm just a little confused as Morroco keeps coming up as a possibility that they will have an air bridge to the U.K. If a airbridge is in place does that mean that everything thing will be open for tourists and free to go around. I know still a lot of unknowns all around. Thanks again!
I really hope so also. Marrakech looks beautiful. Fingers crossed all around.
Marrakech is still in lockdown.
"Its not in full lockdown but there are still some restrictions - most offices are now open with many people back to work and some restaurants/cafes are now operating at 50% capacity, although the lack of tourists means many remain closed.Domestic flights have restarted and its expected there will be an announcement next week about International flights"
Thank you! I will keep my eye on this page for any updates.
Updates will be on the main Covid-19 thread linked in my first response.(I would love to be proved wrong about July)

^^ no Morocco content.
"Were booked for 20th Sep, booked a year ago, hope to still go,am worried about travelling without gov airbridges, i don't get why its not on the list, as marrakesh i believe has only had 50 deaths,and the whole of morroco has had 12,969 cases 229 deaths in total relatively low compared to here,there borders are closed until 15th july to the uk, so hoping they will get added to the list along the line once opened"
"I agree with your reasoning, Karen. I imagine the only reason Morocco isn't on the UK government's list is pragmatism—there's no point listing it when it's not accepting tourists at the moment.I (personally) can't see Morocco opening up in a few days time, but would like to think the infection levels in UK and Europe will be low enough by mid August to allow Morocco to start accepting tourists. However I can't see Americans (North and South) being welcome for a while."
I have took a punt this week and purchased flights for the 21st of September. Hopefully by then Morocco will have opened their borders. The signs are encouraging fingers crossef.
Fingers crossed paul
Thanks Tim! I am sure Morocco will reopen soon to tourist. I hope everyone gets the holidays they are looking forward to.
"Fingers crossed, we go in sep if goes ahead"
"Hi, booked our holiday back in January, we don’t want to travel now, as expected, but have been unable to connect to Love Holidays. Any ideas as we are due to fly on 26th July"
"Denmags If you don't hear from them to cancel, then unfortunately you are kind of stuck,and will have to go or risk losing your money..not having the airbridge with them is causing at alot of money problems for alot of people, we are in the same boat but not untill sep,however due to not advising travel only essential travel and the 14 day quarantine on return our travel insurance is invalid if we do decide to go, but if we dont go we risk losing £2000 if on the beach don't contact us to cancel it... sorry i can't be of more help, good luckEdited: 3:04 pm, July 05, 2020 "
Same with us due to Fly on the 20th of July. As its not part of the travel corridor I presumed I would been able to cancel but I've heard nothing. Around £5000 down.
"Everybody seems to be paying an awful lot of money for their trip to Morocco, I'm only £264 out of pocket on a cancelled Easyjet return flight from Glasgow to Malaga ( the cheapo route) and have been promised a refund of this amount by the travel agency, although it's going to be another three months before this cash materialises as a credit to my Visa card account due to a huge backlog of cancellations currently being processed, I've also received a 50% refund on my (equally cheapo) cancelled travel insurance policy.One aspect of the current situation which would deter me from travelling to Morocco until spring next year would be the expectation of all the extra outstretched grasping hands begging for money, and regular tricksters intensifying their 'louche' activities to compensate for inevitable cash shortfalls due to the sparsity of free-spending daft tourists.Just all too stressful for me!...."
"@KS: Given that most 'good' muslims don't touch alcohol, the type of Moroccans found in the 'louche' bars that you constantly mention visiting tend to be the dregs of society. So it's not surprising you seem to repeatedly encounter less desirable characters on your travels.@John G: If I understand correctly you have flights from UK to Morocco on 20 July. If Morocco hasn't opened its airspace by then the flight will be cancelled by the airline and you will be due a refund. If you have booked a package holiday comprising both flights and hotels on the same booking then you should be covered by ABTA. Otherwise you will have to rely on your travel insurance.Edited: 6:02 am, July 06, 2020 "
Captainsensible Our cost is a package price for 2 adults and 2 children all inclusive for 11nts. It is very stressful
"I expect we will hear official news about international flights this week, probably not until Friday thoughI can understand that this uncertainty will be difficult for many who had booked summer holidays long ago - I suppose the only thing you can do is keep calling whoever you booked with to demand a refund and speak to your travel insurance provider to understand where you stand"
"Hi Tim, thanks for your kind reply. Do you think Morocco will open its airspace on the 10th? I am concerned that it will resulting in me losing my money as I will need to quarantine in the UK when I return.I havd contacted my hotel and they informed me that they are reopening from the 10th of July and indicated they believed airspace is to be reopened.Any help greatly appreciated"
"Morocco is in the process of repatriating thousands of citizens who have been stranded abroad and is bring in about 5,000 per week with maybe two to three weeks more in this process. These citizens are being self isolated in otherwise empty hotels paid for by the state. I would love to be proved wrong but I just can’t see that foreign tourists would be allowed in without quarantine in the middle of this process. If asked to guess I would go for end July as the earliest."
"I hope for everyone this is solved soon, & everyone gets a much deserved holiday in these unprecedented times. Marrakech is an amazing place, I'm due to fly on 12th September, staying at Les Jardins De La Koutoubia, 2nd time, I would recommend popping in just for a drink."
"Were staying at Aqua fun, it will be our 3rd time there,we love it!!that's if all goes well..."
Fingers crossed Karen....Kids will be devastated if their holiday gets cancelled.
@ PogoSFCHave you tried the Indian restaurant in the hotel there?
"Yes, The Bala restaurant is as the most amazing Indian Cuisine you will taste, its on the rooftop of Les Jardins De La Koutoubia."
"I have been there3 , very good put pricey. I also like the cheaper Indian place behind the CarreEden mall. Though the food is very good the service needs improvement."
"I find Jardins de Bala quite overpriced and food just average - it is a lovely spot on the rooftop of that hotel though and Indian food in Morocco tends to be on the expensive sideEdited: 4:39 am, July 07, 2020 "
I tried the so called Indian restaurant behind carre eden and found it to be poor.Not sure the chef is Indian or if a local actually knows what Indian/Pakistani should taste like.Small place and service was good but the flavour & taste of the food is not authentic Indian I’m afraid.
Can theyNot reschedule?
Perhaps Meg can help? https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/horoscopes/
What about August?
"It's possible, but not probable. Who can tell what will happen in the next five weeks? I suspect Morocco will firstly want to see what happens when it opens the flood gates to the tens of thousands of Moroccan ex-pats who are likely to return for summer holidays. If cases don't go mad it might then consider allowing foreign tourists, but that will depend on the infection rates in the countries the tourists are coming from. Your profile doesn't say where you are from."
I'm from the uk
UK will be near the bottom of the list of who is allowed in when they eventually reopen to touristsAfter Eid (so basically August) is probably when it will happen but second spikes could change all that
"And if the regulations regarding testing remain the same, it won't be possible for UK passengers to travel as they won't get test results back within the required 48 hours. This is currently proving to be a problem for Moroccans stuck in other countries."
"Sorry, what is this 48 testing requirement?"
"Passengers are required to present both a PCR virus test taken within fewer than 48 hours of the flight as well as an antibody test, before boarding planes heading for Morocco.you might want to read.https://ma.usembassy.gov/25161/Although it is not as hard as this article portrays to get a test , it is true in many places there can be a great difficulty getting a test result back in time for the 48 hour window.https:/…"
Ok thankyou for your help.
Morroco has extended lockdown until 10/08/2020 i have been told by a friend in the leisure sector for international tourists and is likely to do so after that until end of septwmber
"No, Morocco hasn't extended lockdown, what it has done is to extend the state of emergency that gives government additional powers to 10 August. Lockdown has been gradually released in many parts of the country. However international tourism is not allowed. Your friend in the leisure sector is really just guessing same as everyone else but he may well be right that international tourism will not restart until October."
"Getting the PCR test done is quite easy. Just go online and book a drive through test on the NHS. You will get the results the next day. Best to do it 3 days before your flight in case the results are held up a day for any reason. However, the antibody test will need to be undertaken privately with BUPA or similar. Of course if air bridges are agreed with certain countries these tests may not be required. I would be pleasantly surprised if tourists were allowed back in August. September far more likely - even if they miss out on the peak holiday period."
@ noureddineIt is good to know now in the UK you can get an official test result back with in 24 hours of the test. Earlier it was a problem that it was take more then 2 days making the test result useless for Moroccan travel.Though your advice to get the test 3 days before your flight is very bad advice as you will not be allowed to board your flight if you take the test 3 days before you are leaving.
"Hmm.I wish things could be written in words of one syllable, TheUS Embassy website referenced in one of your previous posts states ""They must show negative results issued within 48 hours of departure of a PCR test and a serological test."". ""Issued"", not ""taken""."
Not sure what the US embassy website has to do with the Moroccan rules for entry into Morocco.
"A little taster of the real world situation for Moroccans trying to take a ferry back to Morocco... https:/…A more positive report: https:/…Edited: 4:53 am, July 19, 2020 "
@Comicman. Have a look at your post #46. You yourself referenced it as a source for the rules on entering Morocco.
That was for the person from the USA asking the question. The other link was from Morocco World a News ( ok they are known to sometimes report a bit sloppily lol).
HiHave a look at the Covid-19 master thread. The comments on the article linked by TimCullis are interesting.
Any news on when Morocco will open to tourists?
"At the moment the pandemic is increasing its hold, and medical facilities are in danger of being overwhelmed. So in order to protect the population, this rise in active cases first has to be stopped, then reversed. And then comes the other problem which is that undoubtedly alllowing tourists from even countries with low infection rates will likely start the whole process escalating again. For UK tourists the earliest I could think of would be November/December but UK figures could by then be worsening as winter approaches. For Americans possibly next Easter. A vaccine would help. So would a crystal ball."
"It's the way the Kaptain tells themHe is truly a fun loving observing Louis Theroux. The ""louche"" bar can be entertaining but there are many decent people just having an affordable beer.The professional beauty salons are very welcoming and great for a chat.My feet and hands have been cared for by Moroccan lady beauticians for over ten years. Moroccan music is a huge attraction and the way the Moroccan ladies dance is a fine art.The cactus fruit provided by street sellers is a lovely delight.How the vendor peels a cactus one after the other and you salivate with joy until you feel the need to stop.The assistance you receive when adverse things happen to you. It's an amazing space is Morocco where the mind can go into overdrive into the realm of adventure and fantasy unremittingly. Its Morocco."
Welcome back Mozart. I hope you are keeping well in these dark times.Very nice post but not sure how this fits in a thread about UK / Morocco land bridge. Maybe start a new thread with your thoughts on Morocco. More people would see it. Posted here only those interested in the land bridge see it.But I digress.
