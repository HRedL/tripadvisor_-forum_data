"Yes, I met American visitors in Croatia last week - you need a proof of paid accommodation and a negative test."
"Please be aware that #3 response isn’t totally accurate. As #1 states the test has to have been done within 48 hours of your arrival, if it was done before that it will be as classed invalid and you will be told to self isolate at your accommodation for up to 14 days.Edited: 4:50 am, July 20, 2020 "
"Dean, it is best done 48 hours before arrival as poster number 2 correctly linked to the Ministry of Interior""s announcement These persons are not subject to a quarantine / self-isolation measure if they present a negative PCR result of a nasal and throat swab for SARS-Cov-2 at the border crossing point, which is not older than 48 hours (counting from the time of taking the swab to arriving at the border crossing point).If third-country nationals have a test older than 48 hours when entering Croatia, they will be allowed to enter Croatia, however, they will be obligated to self-isolate and re-test themselves in Croatia at their own expense.Edited: 7:32 am, July 20, 2020 "

"@Eva, This is from the link you have posted yourself.If third-country nationals have a test older than 48 hours when entering Croatia, they will be allowed to enter Croatia, however, they will be obligated to self-isolate and re-test themselves in Croatia at their own expense.Hence a test older than 48 hours is invalid.Edited: 10:34 am, July 20, 2020 "
"Oh, you confused me by saying “it will be as classed invalid” instead of “it will be classed as invalid” - but we are saying the same thing so all good"
