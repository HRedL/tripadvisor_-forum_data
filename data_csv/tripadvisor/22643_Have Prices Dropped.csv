HI with the baht increase and alot less tourist i was wondering have prices dropped in regards to food/shopping ??thank you in advanced.
thais tend to increce prices as the trade slows down ----it's thai logic to charge more to get a similar profit to when its busy
"Baht prices for food ,never goes down except when items are on saleits 1,000% irrelevant if the baht is 31.5 to the $ or 50 to the $"
"What a naive logic ? Do prices drop in your country, when your currency has a higher appreciation ?"
#4 +1The only impact a stronger or weaker THB will have is on the price of imported goods.BTW the baht has weakened not strengthened against western currencies in the past few months.
"it has only weakened in the last 6 weeks, since the virus scare started,6 weeks ago $1= 30.16,( Jan 4th) , now 31.5Edited: 11:18 pm, February 21, 2020 "
"Yes, thank you coronavirus for saving me a few thousand THB LOL"
"Yes, my Dec / Jan direct deposit aren't as nice as Feb's. May the trend continue for March and beyond.Me me me ... On a retirement visa, one baht float is very noticeable:800k @ 30 / 1 USD = $26,666800k @ 31 / 1 USD = $25,806An extra 26,000 a year, over ฿2,000 a month. That's a few extra beers, or meals out.Difference between Dec's vs March' deposit, should be ฿2 bath......oh yea, now I can retire.........in styleEdited: 12:05 am, February 22, 2020 "
"@mrc. Lol yes of course, ultimately i am saving CAD, but regardless i find it ironic there are so many silly doom and gloom/should i cancel posts......thanks to those chumps, i can now afford to stay longer!"
"Yea, I'm not complaining either, OK, I am, about the trolls, but not the slide in the baht.Even more so, just took a few more satang hit, due to the one political party being banned yesterday. USD got another little lift.Awaiting the demonstrations in the street.....฿35 35 35 35 ..... 555OK, maybe ฿32, anything better than < ฿30, as Dec was ฿29.5 / $1 So looking at ฿2 jump for my March deposit."
it was not been 29.5 in the past 5 years and only in april 2013 when it rose to 28.67 and hit its peak.in the past 10 yearshttps://www.xe.com/currencycharts/…Notme;u seems to post BS more than many here
"I got 29.5 or .7 for Dec deposit, thank you. Remember they keep 1%"" Highest: 31.544 THB on 21 Feb 2020.Average: 30.463 THB over this period.Lowest: 29.695 THB on 31 Dec 2019 ""https:/…USD-THB-exchange-rate-history.htmlIf you don't know what you are talking about, then you probably shouldn't.Edited: 12:49 am, February 22, 2020 "

"Learn how to read charts, and look at the 1 yr, not the 10 yr, it's a bit easier.This from you link, but a 1 yr chart:""USD/THB close:31.57131 low:29.69094 high:32.07127""https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/…....I didn't say it hit 29.5, remember that 1 % int'l feeI said "" I got "" or close to it, as I don't pay attention that much, just ball park.

Prices have gone up if anything for food/shopping.
The THB was one of the strongest performing currencies in the world during 2019.During 2020 to date it is one of the poorest performing....and it’s getting worse because of Coronavirus and the negative effect this is having on the tourist industry.The only thing that I have noticed reduce in price in baht terms is accommodation. Several hotels that I book with on a regular basis have reduced their rates for 2020 with almost no arm twisting.
Yes some rooms are cheaper but many are still high. Walk-in prices are often cheaper than online I found. The baht has not dropped very much considering the drop in tourist numbers.
"Yes, and Thailand with a huge reserve of USDs, can make it float either way, which helps or hurts their exports.Tough balancing act keeping it at 30 ish / USD, without burning off too much reserve. I don't think they mind losing a bit of strength. Certainly the exporters and manufacturing sector doesn't.Never dips below 30 / $1 USD too long, before they step in.Edited: 6:10 am, February 22, 2020 "
"Yes MrC....but don't underestimate the contribution that tourism makes to the Thai GDP, isn't it somewhere around 20%.Falling exports because of the baht appreciation in 2019 now coupled with dramatic fall in tourism revenue contributing to the baht's fall. For the UK£ we're now 10% up on about 10 weeks ago."
And again yes MrC Thailand is indeed a very rich country. One family is actually the richest of it's kind in the world. How some in Thailand got to be so rich (for a developing country) is an interesting topic to debate.
"Yes, apparently a military career also, can be extremely lucrative."
"Me me me .... all good newsBetween the virus, and I believe more so, the soon to erupt political unrest, as the Unis are having not so quiet mass "" discussions / protests ' on campus, the exchange rate is looking good.............Well, for ME, and exporters & holiday'ers.Now at ฿31.7 ish / $1 USD, which is a whole 2 baht more than my Dec. direct deposit.Every 1 baht = about ฿2200 extra a month or more as it weakens. Looking at about ฿4400 more in the pocket next month. (based on ฿800k yearly ret visa requirement)฿29.7 vs 31.7.....Dec vs March, low of 2019 vs NowHope you EUR & GBP holders are getting the same bump..........................ENJOYEdited: 8:30 pm, February 26, 2020 "
"More good news....flight prices are dropping, have my eye on bkk-yyz for july, korean air prices are down $150 in just the past week for this route"
"I haven't seen any drop in flight prices from the UK (NCL) to BKKUnfortunately Emirates May prices are about 25-30% higher than normal May prices, and that was the case before the virus news started"
"Lots of flights are being cancelled, so something to beware of. Singapore has cancelled a load I’m hearing. No doubt other airlines will do to."
"Suspect you're correct, and a lot more will be cancelled. Damn expensive flying half full to empty air crafts."
