HI we are a group of 5 arriving in Barcelona T2 airport on Monday morning. Taxi fare I have calculated is €50. However I would like to use public transport as allows us to used to transport for the few days we are in Barcelona.I have downloaded city planner app which appears to be excellent. My question I see the T10 is available until end of Feb but Badelona is is not in Zone1. Would anyone be able to tell me what zone it is in? Also for us traveling into zone1 from Badelona everyday what would be the best ticket to be getting?City planner says 60mins public transport from Airport to BarcelonaA2 Bus to PL Espanyathen Espanya to Clot then Clot to Badalona60 mins for 5 people or Taxi €50 for 30 mins Advise appreciated please
"First, the T-10 has been replaced by the T-Casual. Until the end of this month, it functions identically to the T-10, although with a small increase in price over last year's T-10. (10 rides for 11,35€) Commencing 1 March, there will be a new T-familiar card (8 rides for 10€) that will be shareable and as of that date the T-casual will no longer be shareable. (i.e., each passenger will need their own card.)The zone system is confusing because there are two, one for the integrated system (which is what one uses the T-Casual et al within) and one non-integrated, just for the commuter trains. The good news is that the integrated system using the T-Casual includes both the airport and Badalona in zone 1 so you will need to pay only the 11,35€. Were you to buy individual commuter train tickets (which would make no sense in your case), they would cost over 4 euros EACH, and that is just for one way.I don't know what the city planner you are referring to is, but it is bad advice in this case. You will take the R2N train from T2 (this is the only train at this station) to Sants station where you have an easy connection to the R1 train to Badalona. All covered on the single fare each. The schedule (all of this info is at http://rodalies.gencat.cat/) varies between 45 minutes and just under an hour, including the transfer but of course not including any time you have to wait for the train at the airport. More questions, just ask and someone will help."
"That planners sounds like or uses the same information as Google Maps: it ignores the existence of the Rodalies trains and insists on using the Aerobus (A1 or A2) from the airport. (The Aerobus is not part of the public transport network, and does not take tickets like the T-casual.)"
"Hi! I have a related question. Our last trip to Barcelona was in 2014. We are planning another trip this year and looking at an apartment near the Collblanc Metro Station. Instead of taking the Aerobus to Plaza Espagna and transferring to a taxi (we have 2 20 kg suitcases) to the apartment, is it feasible to just take the Metro Line S9 that stops at Collblanc station? My major concern is getting from the platform level to street level in Collblanc Station. Is there an escalator or lift to street level? Thanks anyone."
"Follow up question. I checked street view on the map and it seems there is a lift to street level. But is there a lift to the platform level. In some major cities, there is a lift from street level to gate level and another lift to platform level. What does Collblanc Station have? Thanks again."
"First of all, for your stay it is better to choose a central area and not a place close to the airport metro.Collblanc is a neighborhood in the nearby city L'Hospitalet de Llobregat that boarders Barcelona. The metro is on the boarder between the cities and is located off center so you might be near the access to the airport but far fro the main areas that you'll be at during your stay.In any case, apart from a short list of old metro stations that were not adapted yet to people with reduced mobility all stations have elevators from street level to the main entrance and from there to the platforms. In the case of L9S it is also essential as in this are the platform can be up to 80m underground so an elevator is a must (there are also escalators but passing 5-6 flights is not very efficient).Be aware that you cannot use the mentioned cards (T-Casual and T-Familiar) for the airport metro.A single ticket to the metro to/from the airport is 5.15€.I suggest you find a more central location and we'll be able to suggest the easiest way to get there. The mentioned cards can be used for the regular bus and for the train.The train station is near T2 (from T1 you can get the free shuttle to T2). There is a train every 30 minutes (on .08 and .38 of each hour) and it stops in the city center station of Passeig de Gracia with an easy change to L3 and a very easy change to trains going to Estació de França (which requires you to stay on the same platform and wait for one). You can also make a relatively easy change (you'll need to change platforms) in Barcelona-Sants to get to the train station in Pl. Catalunya.The bus is very convenient, especially with suitcases, as it saves you going up down (which is still annoying, even with elevators)/ The 46 bus (from T1 with stops in T2) will get you to Pl. Espanya with easy changes to buses going to the center (by easy I mean, getting off and waiting at the same stop for the second bus).Be aware that on the bus you can only buy a single 2.40€ ticket that does not include changes (driver gives change but will not accept notes larger than 10€). In T1 you can buy cards at the tobacconist shop in the T1 arrival hall. In T2 you can buy cards at the train station but if you go all the way to the station take the train.The aerobús is a fas service with only 4 stops in the city: Pl. Espanya, Gran Via/Urgel, Pl. Universitat and Pl. Catalunya. There are plenty of hotels close to one of the stops so it is very convenient. This bus is not part of the integrated system so you cannot use any of the mentioned cards (or any other integrated cars). The current fare is 5.90€ one way or 10.20€ return (valid for 15 days). You can buy tickets online, from their website, from the machines at the airport or from the drive (gives change but will not accept notes larger than 20€)."
"Hi this sounds like great advise the ""Sants"" station you refer to is that Estacio Sants"" Many thanks for your helpful reply"
"yes, estació is station in Catalan."
now it all makes sense thank you so much
To me it doesn't. Collblanc is nowhere near Badalona...
that was a reply to another question not mine!!
yes we seem to have an epidemic of people piggybacking onto largely unrelated threads instead of starting a new one.

"In the past I tried to tell people that uses another post for their question to open a new one but it seems like a lost cause as people look at as a a conversation, not a question/answer so it's easier to answer instead of trying to change that. I will answer the OP's question first but in this case a good answer was given.As for the OP's question. I can add one suggestion, instead of changing in Sants you should consider making the change in El Clot Aragó which is a small station with an easy change.Depending on where in Badalona you´re staying it might be closer to take the L2 metro. You can change at Passeig de Gracia or El Clot-Aragó, just be aware that the change requires a bit of a walk."
