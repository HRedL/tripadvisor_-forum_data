"After receiving the latest figures from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for the week of Jan. 29 to Feb. 4, Health Secretary Lorenzo González declared a dengue fever epidemic in Puerto Rico late Friday.“According to the information received in the Department today and corresponding to week five (Jan. 29 to Feb. 4), 204 cases [of dengue] were reported to the CDC, and the epidemic threshold for that week was 139. This means there were 65 cases above the threshold of epidemic,” González said in a written statement.The most affected municipalities are Camuy, Arecibo, Bayamón, San Juan, Juncos, Humacao and Yabucoa.The Health secretary said that for the month of January, 210 dengue cases were positively confirmed, which is of concern when compared to the data of 2007, the last year a dengue epidemic occurred on the island. In Jan. 2007 there were 67 confirmed cases of dengue in Puerto Rico.González said the agency plans to carry out a public service campaign to educate the public about the best measures to prevent dengue. In addition, Health has approved the purchase of 10 specialized machines, at a total cost of $80,000, to fumigate communities islandwide. The agency is also in the process of hiring 10 vector control inspectors who will train and certify environmental health inspectors for the fumigation effort.Feliciano urged the public to remain vigilant and continue with preventive measures to minimize outbreaks of dengue. “As we have stressed in recent weeks, everyone has to do their part, eliminate potential mosquito breeding sites, remove trash around homes, check water meters, and above all, use insect repellent containing 20 percent DEET in exposed areas, mainly for children, among other measures,” he said.Since the start of the year there have been three confirmed cases of hemorrhagic dengue, which is more severe than classical dengue, but no deaths have been associated with the disease.Last week Health also said residents should be aware of the symptoms of the diseases, which in severe cases, can lead to death.The Director of the Prevention and Control of the Dengue Division, Marta Patricia Cano, said, “people have to distinguish between classical dengue and hemorrhagic dengue.”Cano explained that cases in which the patient has fever, headaches and muscular pain, pain behind the eyes, and skin rash, can be treated as classical dengue and suggests patients visit their primary doctor instead of visiting an emergency room.“It is like a flu that can be treated at home, but people cannot take aspirin because it will alter the coagulation process and can make the patient suffer a hemorrhage,” she said.However, “if symptoms include high fever, intense abdominal pain, if the fever is high and all of a sudden low and [patients] begin to have cold sweat, they would be entering a shock stage and bleeding can occur through the gums or nose. Women can have bleeding similar to menstruation,” she said.These dangerous dengue symptoms have to be taken care of immediately in an emergency room. “If in 24 through 48 hours the patient doesn’t stabilize, the person can die,” Cano said."

We are planning a vacation trip at the end of March to Puerto Rico. How wide-spread is the dengue epidemic in the country? Are there areas that are most impacted? How frequent are these epidemics in Puerto Rico and how long do they last?Thank you in advance to all for your responses.
"As stated in the article, the last time a dengue epidemic was declared here was in 2007. Also from the article ""The most affected municipalities are Camuy, Arecibo, Bayamón, San Juan, Juncos, Humacao and Yabucoa.""The epidemic may be ""cleared up"" but the end of March, or it may not. We'll have to hope things dry up, and the mosquito population decreases.Though it's an epidemic, the odds of contracting dengue are still relatively low. Take the indicated precautions."
Thank you for your answer. Let's hope it dries up.
