"""Cuba is a great place to visit"".Thats the first positive thing I've seen that you've written. Most people on this forum are either asking for advice about their holiday or providing advice from their own experiences, helping people out. Your input on the other hand isn't really helpful in my opinion. For example your post above, ""Cuba might be dangerous gastronomical experience"". No advice there at all. How about telling the OP about safe hygene etc?You're not alone here by the way, there are others who use the forum for their own agenda and yes I agree there are also the ones who won't have a bad word said in any event.Lets try to answer questions as honestly and factually as we can.Someone please correct me if I'm missing something."

"I wouldn't be worried travelling to Varadero, it's very far from where most of the cholera cases are.But someone I know who lives in Havana was recently advised not to travel to the province of Granma to visit family because of the cholera situation there, so I assume that it's not completely over."
"First of all, there is no cholera epidemic. Back at the beginning of July, there was an outbreak of Cholera in Granma Province. Rather than repeat myself, I would suggest you read my reply #39 at this topic, where I gave a summary of the events between July 2nd and 19th, as reported in various news media.tripadvisor.ca/…42501222Since the 19th, there has been no consistent news regarding number of cases. The last report I had seen, around 7/19/2012, had reported a total of 158 cases with three deaths (the deaths all being elderly people with existing health problems).A report from media located in the Cayman Islands has mentioned 236 cases, but examiner.com (based in the USA) has reported as of July 30 only 137 cases. Because of the inconsistency of these reports, it is difficult to know what is correct. But, as there have been no credible reports in the major worldwide media since 7/19/2012, it is likely that the outbreak has been controlled, and it is quite clear that it was localized to the area of the original outbreak."
"CJ - you are right, the outbreak stayed very localized (thank goodness!), and it is probably under control, but it would be nice to have direct local news. I can tell you that the advisory my friend received not to travel to Granma (near Manzanillo in fact, where most of the outbreak occurred) is very recent (10 days ago). At that time, there was still a ""situation"" in the area - but I have zero idea of the extent of the current ""situation"" though. I'll try to remember to ask the next time I'm in touch with this person.That being said, I would have no worries about travelling elsewhere in Cuba, even with my young child!"
Just checked the travel report on the Canadian Gov website and there are no warnings issued for Cuba!! Check out the website voyage.gc.ca/countries_pays/…Relax and enjoy your trip!!
