"Of course none of us know, but just wondering what everyone thinks about how long this state of affairs will last. Since this is a travel forum, I'll keep it in the travel context. I've been able to postpone most of my trip (hotels, flights, etc.) to August, but wonder if that's going to be any better. Do you guess that by summer we'll be back to life kind of as normal? Or do you foresee this dragging on month after month?I can't imagine we'll be all holed up at home and planes virtually grounded through next fall or winter. (Then again, I couldn't have imagined that we'd be where we are...)My guess is the next two months bring: (1) some better therapy options, (2) some minimal degree of triage preparedness (3) general acceptance of the virus (and its death toll) as a fact of life. Having weathered tremendous economic and social pain and achieved some degree of ""curve flattening"" over the next couple of months, my guess is that restrictions start to ease and life will claw back to semi-normal. I'm not sure, but I'm going to guess that this will turn into what I believe polio was like -- a horrible thing that we just have to live with until a cure is found.Of course, that is all out the window of the toll is much, much higher. I think most countries will grudgingly have to accept thousands of extra fatalities if either we or nature keep it to that. But if it starts running into the tens of thousands? Hundreds of thousands? Millions? Then I'm clueless about what happens in the next six months or even year. I guess maybe that's just beyond my imagining. So perhaps this is just my lack of imagination, but my guess is life gets back to normalish by early summer, and I'll see you all in London in August. Hope I'm right."
"I reckon October.But as you rightly point out ""Of course none of us know""Edited: 8:46 am, March 15, 2020 "
I would give it 12 months
"I thin k a hot summer would kill it off, we dont get flu epidemics in July."
"I think nobody knows. It seems so prevalent worldwide that it won't be eliminated easily. So the current lockdowns will only act on the first wave of infection, and more outbreaks will continue. Lockdowns can't continue forever without breaking the economy. Hopefully it will subside in time as we get used to reducing contact as we wait for treatments or vaccines.The UK govt plans talk about a peak of infections over a c 9 week period. I think it's touch and go whether you will be ok in August. Restrictions may have to be relaxed to avoid collapse of companies and banks.Edited: 9:14 am, March 15, 2020 "
"Lots of places with higher temperatures than the UK suffering, although it may reduce instances, I doubt a hot summer will kill it off."
"You don't need to guess. There are plenty of expert predictions out there. The most common theory is that in the UK it will peak in May and drop off significantly by Sept/Oct.Your assumptions are very wrong. We will not have ""some better therapy options"" by summer. Experts are predicting a vaccine is at least a year away. I have no idea what ""some minimal degree of triage preparedness"" means, but the facts are that there are a limited number of hospital beds and they will fill up quickly. You can't build new hospitals and train new doctors in a matter of weeks. I really don't understand why you imagine ""general acceptance of the virus (and its death toll) as a fact of life"" will improve matters. If large numbers of workers die or are too sick to work, then supply chains will fail and there will be specific shortages and closures.I strongly suggest you do not make any travel plans until there is greater clarity."
"Airlines will have gone bust and many businesses closed. Hotels will need deep cleaning. So not normal by summer, no. There will be a new normal. Maybe functional but less tourism within a year?"

"Knowbody knows but I think that almost all long haul international flights will stop in the next 2 weeks. Europe and the US will go into lockdown in 7-21 days. That lockdown could be for 3 months. The lockdown will start to breakdown after 3-4 weeks though as people wont be able to afford to not be at work. We might be back to normal in late summer. However by that time multipule airlines, hotels, restuarants etc will have gone bust and we will all be in a recession that will last for a couple of years. I don't think the death toll will be that bad, maybe 10k in Europe, same in USA. The economic impact will be much bigger than the physical impact."
"#9 This event will mark the beginning of the end of The New World Order. Globalization, no borders, outsourcing important products like medicines and equipment etc. to China, unfettered travel. When your life and you're family's health are at stake you get nationalistic, fast. This is the start of the pendulum swinging back to more protectionism, self reliance, paranoia of outsiders and nationalism. The days of opening your borders and having who knows who come in willy nilly with diseases or occupying that hospital bed that your daughter needs.....is OVER. Stick a knife in Globalization...it's dead!"
"There certainly are therapy options under study that may (may, possibly, fingers crossed) come into use well before a vaccine. Not silver bullets, but things that help. (Kind of like how we've learned to manage AIDS without curing it)As for triage, I mean just that. We humans learn pretty quickly. Sure, we can't build new hospitals by summer (unless we're the Chinese), but even rudimentary things like getting tents up can help. We'll be getting better at figuring out the course of things so we can triage more effectively who can stay home, who can be put in a tent or a gym with an IV, and who needs a full hospital room.Hey, I'm not Mr. Optimist here. I was way ahead of the curve buying up hand sanitizer, prepping food, etc. I even have home health equipment bought and ready to go. Just saying that we humans (for all of our faults) are pretty good figuring out ways to keep on keeping on. It's hopeful, and possibly not true, but not outside the realm of possibility."
"I remember being told we would add die from Aids/mad cow disease/salmonella from eggs/ nuclear fallout.Yes, it is bad, but' We never died a Winter yet'."
I very much hope so.But not as good a bet as Cheltenham.
"The scientific advisers said last Thursday that they were expecting the peak to be within 10-14 weeks - but the aim of current policy is to flatten the peak incidence and thereby extend it in time, so that would push the worst through into August and maybe part of September, with no firm forecast of what would constitute enough of a subsidence to lift restrictions. But so much is unknown about this thing: and one of the worries I've seen mentioned is that after seeming to die down it might erupt again."
"""one of the worries I've seen mentioned is that after seeming to die down it might erupt again.""I've thought about this a lot. I get the ""flatten the curve"" idea, but aren't we really just pushing the curve down the road than actually flattening it?!"
"IT appears to have been removed. I didn't see, but it looks as though enough people didn't like it to get it taken down, at least temporarily.As to the OP's question, I wouldn't even like to guess.Edited: 10:07 am, March 15, 2020 "
"None of us know when things will get back to normal or if the world will need to adjust to a ""new normal."" Staying inside is doable during the winter; however, when spring, summer & fall arrive, I fear being stuck inside will feel like I'm a grounded 15 yo."
"It's a tough call. So many variables involved, both health and economic related. Health concerns obviously need to be the priority for governments. But the harsh reality is that economies can only be propped up by governments for so long- and I'm thinking perhaps a couple of months, and then, if at all possible, they would need to strongly consider trying a gradual return toward ""normal."" Everyone's putting forward their best guess here, but I think that governments have to be at least hoping to begin at least a partial return by mid-summer (July/August). If not, that means things have not been contained nearly as well as they'd hoped and the world economies are really going to tank (long term) as well."
"Personally I’m not sure we will get back to ‘normal’ because the potential damage will drive a new version of normal. It difficult to see airlines, hotels, restaurants theatres etc surviving a prolonged shutdown, and even when HMG says it’s safe to go outside there might be a rush, but there might just be an excess of caution.Then there’s the death toll. Nobody knows how many died in that epidemic (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu) but the world was less connected then. Spanish flu was different though, it’s victims were mostly working age, Covid 19 is really dangerous if you are over 80, so countries with ageing populations may suffer disproportionately. Whatever arithmetic you do the idea of perhaps 10,000 deaths in Europe (post 10) looks like a a few orders of magnitude adrift.So perhaps in September we’ll see a world in recession, with less choice of things to do or places to go, far higher unemployment and maybe a structural shift in those things that do succeed in the years to come driven by population demographic changes and technology.But back to the OPs question, nobody knows, but even if the health care situation is relatively risk free by September I doubt a recognisable ‘normal’ will be around until early 2021. Let’s hope for Christmas."
"welcome,all you can do is to hope and guess like others are doing. I think the further out you can postpone, the better, but i also say that the bug has not finished doing its thing yet. Even with a ""vaccine"" i dont see it any better than what they have for the flu now. and its a crap shoot if they can guess what flu bug will be out and what vaccine will be given.You may want to look at the big picture too. Not just the vacation, but can you tolerate any quarantine? How about your job(s),? what will your employeer do if you are away for days or weeks beyond your scheduled time off?what about your kids? school or ?""...polio was like -- a horrible thing that we just have to live with until a cure is found...""sorry, but this is a no duh. Any new bug will do this. If we are unlucky, it has a high mortality rate. If we are lucky, all it does is to put you in bed for a week. Its life. Consider what happened to the Native Americans when the whites came to the new world and brought some bugs with them.Shoes on the other foot now.people have their head in the clouds and think everything is all rosy. Sorry to tell you the WORLD is a DYNAMIC system. Its not STATIC where things stay the same. its also nature at work too."
#11 Excellent news for the Native Americans.
#23...and those who lived under the boot of colonialism!
Indeed. Ironically today's anti-globalisation advocates do not see anything wrong with colonialism.
"I would nt book anything .....wait and see. I am inclined to think we will be very fortunate if things normalize towards end 2020. You have to remember, it's like a football match Mexican wave. It's all speed in the beginning but it continues on and on and then backwards til itfinally dies down. Only to restart later again.I am trying to save you spending money you may never get the benefit of..."
@23 and 24..Just remember what happened to your civilisations when they encountered diseases from Europe. Smallpox and Measles wiped out vast numbers of people without physical intervention. But Asia gave Europe The Black Death which killed somewhere between 30% and 69% of the entire European population.It’s easy to blame foreigners for pandemics but they don’t really discriminate.
"""I am trying to save you spending money you may never get the benefit of...""Oh, I know. I'm not spending any money. It's just curiosity at this point. I was planning an April-May trip and I have a fair number of sunk costs already - flights, hotels, etc. - that I've been working to move to a later date. August was about as late as I could move stuff under the current flexibility rules.So I might lose money -- but it's money I would have lost anyway,"
You should get flight money back via refunds or credit towards future travel or free date change. Hotels are also making exceptions but policies vary more.
"I'm due to visit again at the end of June and its just a case fo waiting to see what happens, it changes so fast.My hotel, train tickets and theatre tickets are all paid for so until the government says otherwise, i'm going! I can't get refunds until the officlal word to not travel, no mass gatherings or events is given, lockdown basically because my Travel Insurance won't pay out.Its 15 weeks until I travel, it could be past the peak by then and things are getting back to normalish or we could be at the worst and the country is locked down like Italy etc, who knows how it pans out. I honestly suspect we will be in a Spanish type situation with partial lockdown but i just have to cross my fingers and hope for the best.If thats what happens well so be it, can't do anything about it and just have to deal with it."

"The algorithm/bot that posts under the name ""regmaiche"". appears to be broken, or have gone rogue."
His contributions are oblique and must be deciphered. You will get it.
"Personally, I enjoy Regmaiche׳s sophisticated posts.Back to the topic: This remains the main question, no one can provide a certain answer for. Is it a flu? If it is, it’ll be gone by Summer. What if it isn’t?I’m following the news from poor Italy and Spain. Horrible.They say, UK is about to explode with number of cases... I can only hope, they’re wrong.I still hope my plans for Summer holidays won’t be ruined, but I’m preparing myself to the idea - they might be cancelled.Yuri.P.S. I was supposed to be in the middle of my flight to MAN now."
"COVID-19 is a form of coronavirus, it is not something completely new, just a new form of a well know family of viruses. A nasty one. When will it end? One useful bit of information is to look at the last Coronavirus family pandemic - SARS in 2003. It died out at the end of May. You have to dig into this report for the graph https:/…WHOconsensus.pdf"
"SARS only had about 8000 cases worldwide - we're currently around twenty times that, to give a sense of scale. I'm hopeful I'll be able to take my September trip as planned - a week ago, I was sure this would be over soon. Now I'm really not, but hopefully the preventive measures being put in place work."
"Its up to us wether or not things will be normal. South Korea found the true death rate of the virus by testing thoroughly and it is .7% or less. Twice that become ill enough to need hospitalization, but recover. That is something we can and have to deal with. Currently we are containing the virus to give hospitals time to prepare for the extra patients. But the fact is the vast majority of us will be fine and we cannot halt the economy for much longer or stay locked up in our homes, so things will go back to normal because they have to. Wuhan is already attempting to go back to normal. I think we have around 4 more weeks of shutdown then we will slowly go back to normal."
"Hi, my guess for the UK regarding travel to and from would be, back to normal late summer - August, possibly July if all goes well. Any booked flights etc booked before that I would be looking at cancelling. Very much a guess though. Best plan for holidays in your home country."
"I think the virus itself will have done its worst by July/August, but the question is what kind of country will be left after that? Will it be one in financial crisis? Political instability? Will the foundations of the tourist industry collapse? This is really an unprecedented situation, with official estimates basically implying we're looking at hundreds of thousands of deaths, so all bets are off on that. The UK's strategy is likely to ensure it sees a catastrophic situation early on (other countries - e.g. those in Asia that are having success with this - may see a worse situation later or may avoid serious turmoil altogether) so I would think it's highly likely we'll see a lot of countries place entry bans on anyone who has been to the UK. Those bans might last a while after the outbreak subsides - e.g. China is more or less over its initial outbreak now but there's no sign of countries easing travel restrictions on Chinese citizens. Perhaps by September, if everything goes according to plan, we're edging towards normality but if unintended consequences kick in then there's a non-negligible chance the UK isn't viewed as a normal travel destination for quite some time after that."
"To date, Taiwan (81 miles off the coast of China) has only 49 COVID-19 infections and one (1) death of 23 million residents. Lessons learned after the 1983 SARS outbreak.Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center was activated on Jan. 20, and between then and Feb. 24, it took 124 actions based on assessments gathered from the country’s integration of big data and technology:1. Border control from the air and sea, including travel restrictions and cruise ship bans.2. Case identification (using new data and technology), patients’ 14-day travel history integrated into the National Health Insurance Administration and Immigration Agency database.3. Quarantine of suspicious cases and electronic monitoring of quarantined individuals via government-issued cell phones.4. Proactive case finding.5. Resource allocation (assessing and managing capacity), such as setting up test sites and taking over production of surgical and N95 masks (more than 10 million per day).6. Reassurance and education of the public while fighting misinformation; investigated rumors that started a toilet paper panic and prosecuted a man for claiming cyanide wards off coronavirus.7. Negotiation with other countries and regions.8. Formulation of policies toward schools and childcare.9. Relief to businesses.."
It seems to me there is a choice : shutdown - which will probably save lives in the short term but lead to other problems eg breakdown of society/law & orderease the shutdown - which will lead to more cases and deaths but will allow society to function more normally for the vast majority of people
"My guess - and it's just that - is that by August we may have some slightly better treatments options. At present it doesnt look like they are going to be a lot better but if ACE inhibitors are a risk factor, as suggested, and it's possible to switch to alternatives then maybe smaller numbers will be severely affected. By August many people in the UK will have had the virus, hopefully most of them mildly. The government will want to let people in but the population at large wont be ready to do that and other governments may see the UK as a bigger risk than it will be. So uk businesses may well be reopening and life getting back to something nearer to normal but international travel probably not so much. It's likely to be next year before we get a vaccine and I probably wont want to take it then, the long term impact will be unknown.The economic impact will be massive, wish I could even guess at that."
"Countries like a Taiwan may also have a problem later in this year, or next, when their citizens start traveling again and come into contact with pockets of the virus elsewhere. When they come back to their own country, with very few people with immunity, the epidemic could hit again."
"> Countries like a Taiwan may also have a problem later in this year, or next, when their citizens start traveling again and come into contact with pockets of the virus elsewhere. <This statement is true for ALL of us, in every country, every city, every town."
"Our trip, like yours, is the end of June. I developed a list of everything on my itinerary with cancellation dates - some hotels require 30 days for full refund, others just 2 days. I've got about $1,800 that isn't refundable unless someone changes the policy. I'm washing my hands and then crossing my fingers."
