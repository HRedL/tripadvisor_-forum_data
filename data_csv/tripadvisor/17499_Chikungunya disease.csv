"I have just cancelled a holiday in the French West Indies where ChikV is at epidemic proportions. ChikV is a mosquito-borne disease, similar to/worse than Dengue Fever. Unless public health control measures are very effective, it is likely to spread across the Caribbean. What is the current situation in Barbados please?"
"I read recently that Barbados has the lowest infection rates for both Chikungunya and Dengue fever in the Caribbean region and that there had only been about a dozen confirmed cases, and of those confirmed cases the majority were of Caribbean nationals passing through the island."
"As I have heard, Barbados has been doing a good job of ""drying themselves out"". Use the search function. There are a few threads giving good Information on this subject. This is not a great problem on Barbados, because they have been working on it. And I am sure, they will continue to."
caribbeannewsnow.com/headline-Eleven-confirm…
"Thank you ASO! Even if there are confirmed cases, we see that Barbados are trying to do their best. I don't feel that there is a reason to panik. But we too have to do our part. No stagnant water, mosquito repellant, appropriate clothing - and all during the daytime. This mosquito is day-active."
"Although primarily a day feeder, aedes aegypti can and does bit at any time of day, especially at dawn and dusk. Also indoors and on cloudy days."
"Yes, we know. He's a hungry Little Monster. But all have to do their part."
"Does anyone know the true situation of Chikungunya in Barbados at the moment? The managing agents at the property we are staying at have freeked me out a bit. They say that a large portion of people on the island have had the disease and that we should make sure that we spray ourselves with repellant day and night. We have vape mats in the bedrooms, but apparently the supermarkets are selling out of repellant products - I have yet to see this for myself when I visit. I asked if the government is doing something about it and was told that they don't have the money to provide fogging. Is all this true or is it scaremongering? We noticed notices about the disease on arrival at the aiport - but I have to say, thankfully I haven't seen many mosquitoes as yet. This is all a bit concerning and I just hope the governmennt is dealing with the problem as we don't want a situation of epedemic proportions here, as on other islands."
"If you never worried about catching Dengue Fever, why are you worried about Chikungunya ?--------------it really isn't as bad as full on Dengue and you become immune after one dose, unlike Dengue which after the third dose can be lethal.  Many of my friends now tell me they have had Chik and it varied from an aching wrist or forearm to a full blown rash and flue symptoms . None of them thought it was worthwhile going to the Doctor as Paracetamol is really all he can give you. Just protect yourself as you have always done and stop worrying about it.  There is no point in ruining your holiday over something that probably won't happen ."
Far as we know Govt fogs in areas where it is bad - private establishments (such as our condos etc. and some hotels etc.) fog regularly too - mentioned on another thread was that the last official count was only 40 confirmed cases and many others suspected - but the thinking is that many people are self medicating - not spending money going to doctors and clinics - but that businesses are having staffing probs. - so probably those people are sick with something.
ASO They are still fogging throughout the Island as usual. I saw a notice in the Nation only yesterday.
Westie do they fog private properties or just open areas? Can you explain how it is done?
"The Government Trucks go round various Parishes and pump out a sort of vile smelling smoke like stuff that smells a bit like burning tyres, as they drive along. Children are encouraged not to follow the Trucks but House Holders are asked to leave their windows and doors open so the Fog enters the house.  One time there was a wedding at Mango Bay and the Truck went through Holetown as the bride and groom were exchanging vows , they couldn't see who they were saying"" I Do "" to , the poor things . Fogging routinely has been going on for years , but it is still necessary for all private homes / villas / hotels to make sure they are fogged weekly by private arrangement. as Government Fogging cannot be done so often and obviously cannot cover private gardens etc if they are too far off the road.Edited: 5 years ago "
Thanks for explaining Westie.
"Westiegal, you are wonderful!!! many thanks!!!"
"Yes you're right Westie, I've always been pretty calm about Dengue, but the manager was so 'full on' re Chik, describing awful symptons and telling me 60% of the island have had it! Just panicked me a bit. I guess I will just spray as I have normally done, but also use vapes. Good to hear they are fogging though.Edited: 5 years ago "
@Westiegal & ASOHow do you go about fogging your condos independently? What is used and how do you do it?
60% of the Island??? I don't think that that is fair to say.
If you read the Barbados Nation and Barbados Today that is what the are saying 60%
"@ Babiface -We hire a guy who comes in with his fogging machine and notifies guests and residents that he is about to ""fog' so if they object they can close up tight - but as Westies said - Govt encourages homeowners to leave doors and windows open so the fog can blow in - after it is in - we switch on fans and clear the air etc. Westie can get name of guy if you need him for your villa in Fitts - Haven't read the paper today yet - but can well believe it is rampant - but Govt statistics can only report those cases seen by doctors and clinics etc. - not those who stay home and self medicate"
ASOThank you. I do have the area around the house sprayed but I think fogging would be better. If you could message me with the guys name and number that would be great!
"@NC - guy walks all around the property with his fogging machine blowing out this burnt rubber smelling stuff - and thick white/grey clouds drift up and into the windows and doors filling the rooms (more or less) - we shelter in the room that gets the least smoke/fog - and hold a cloth over our nose - wait for the fogger to finish in our area of the complex - and then turn on the ceiling fans - and blow it out again - not sure that is how one is supposed to deal with it - but it is always just before dinner time - and unless we have dinner reservations it is a case of stay home and get air ""breathable"" again ASAP ....."
"Sorry, we don't get These newspapérs here.....If that is the reported rate, what is the real one??? I am coming home anyway."
@ Babiface - will email our neighbour unless Westie knows and does it first and then pm you
60%?!?! I absolutely just CANNOT believe any such thing! That would mean more than half the people I know would have had it and that's not anywhere near remotely true! Businesses would be temporarily closing down if over half the work force were out sick and that's simply not the case. I only know of a couple of people who have had it and that's only through other people.People here tend to get a cold and immediately tell you they must have dengue. These days they're saying its chickingunya...A storm in a teacup if you ask me.
@ASO Thank you.I also cannot believe that 60% of the population have been effected either. I cannot find this statement in the newspapers? Was it today?
InBarbados - I think you may be right. There has been a very rampant flu type bug doing the rounds in the UK - so could be something like that. But I guess it depends whether this supposed 60% have had blood tests. Seems unbelievable to me - but very concerning.
Maybe someone could publish the link - I couldn't find the article on it either - I found an article saying 49 confirmed cases and some 200 unconfirmed as yet - but that was all.If the people with suspected Chik are not going to the doctor - they are not having blood tests - they are staying home - so who knows what they have or haven't.... sunshinegirl sounds as if she has a point - do they have chik or do they have 'flu?
"Barbados Today on Oct 16th says 49 confirmed cases and 200 suspected. Hardly 60%! In my immediate family who all live here (husband, kids, siblings, nieces, parents and in-laws) not a single one of us, nor any of my friends or co-workers have had it. Oh I lie, a friend of a friend had it. She was out of commission for exactly 2 days. Btw this virus, which I'm not going to attempt to spell again, plays havoc with the old autocorrect! . Barely managed to get something like it down after fighting my autocorrect several times. It was utterly determined to have me type choking or chicken. In the end it was wrong anyway! Next time I'll just go for the ChikV abbreviation I guess..."
"Totally right In Barbados --------------a storm in a teacup and as I said before, if visitors never worried about Dengue then there is no reason at all for them to be worried about Chik.  However, someone has managed to whip up the storm and rendered the Supermarkets empty of BOP, Go and OFF . It couldn't be the makers of these products could it ?? If you listen to the radio adverts you could be forgiven for thinking that way LOL"
"If 60% of Bajans have/had chick I think the CDC in Atlanta would have declared an epidemic, and to my knowledge they have not. Canada and the US would have also put up a travel advisory. They have not.Edited: 5 years ago "
This link will show the number of confirmed and imported cases in Barbados as of Oct. 3rd. Hardly 60%http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?cx=014283770845240200164%3Aprvkaxcnku0&q=chik+Barbados&searchword=chik+Barbados&sa=Search...&cof=FORID%3A0&searchphrase=all&scope=1&option=com_search&Itemid=40145&ie=utf8&site=who&client=amro_en&proxystylesheet=amro_en&output=xml_no_dtd&oe=utf8&getfields=doctype&ai=41037#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=chik%20Barbados&gsc.page=3
"@ASO. Here is the link re Chik, from digital version of Barbados Today.…pagesuite-professional.co.uk/default.aspx…"
Babiface I have pm'd you
Thank you Westiegal.I for one have always been concerned about Dengue fever during the last couple of years as I know a few people who suffered with it and so I am also concerned about this ChikV. Whether the figures are accurate or not we should all take adequate precautions as best we can. Obviously most of the population of Barbados are taking it more seriously and so should we.
Thanks Melva - that was the one I read - nothing about 60%) 49 confirmed - 200 suspected chik
"I agree Babiface. Why take a chance? I think it's good that people in Barbados are taking this seriously and, frankly, I wouldn't expect any other reaction than to buy repellent to protect themselves and their families. Whether the rate of infection is 60% or 6% isn't the point."
"@ Babiface - guess Westie sent you infoYes if the population is taking this seriously - pity they didn't take the ""garbage situation seriously - therein lie the breeding grounds"
"@ASO, yes exactly. An excellent point about the government stepping up preventative measures, like cleaning up garbage, etc. there are also other things one can do like cultivating certain plants and herbs which repel insects. Certain varieties of bats consume huge amounts of Mosquitos."
I just got a response from our landlord and he says because of dengue/chick presence spraying has been increased around the property we rent. Nice to know.
Good to hear that other private owners are taking their guests' health seriously tooEdited: 5 years ago 
"I know a lot of people who have or have had ChikV. I guess it's not pleasant for most, which can be said for every flu or stomach bug! But one thing to keep in mind: it is very rarely dangerous. You may get some lingering joint pains off and on, but you aren't going to land in the hospital or potentially die. It's not like the worse strain of Dengue that you can get. Some people I know went to the doctor to get a slightly stronger pain reliever than what they could get over the counter, to deal with the worst of the joint pain. Others have found that Paracetamol/Tylenol was enough and they didn't need the doctor. It also lasts for varying lengths of time, depending on how badly you get it. My 14 year old son had textbook symptoms on Thursday and by Sunday he was back surfing. That's young joints for you!"
"From the descriptions I have been hearing many have stated it is worse than dengue in addition, the virus can live in your body for three years with symptoms coming on and off. Regardless once one takes the necessary precautions they should be safe."
Bajanswife - doesn't sound like something a 90 yr old who has bad knees and uses a walker needs!!!!
"Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. It causes fever and joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and sometimes a rash. These symptoms usually occur 3 to 7 days after infection but can be up to 12 days and last 7 to 10 days but longer in some people and they can be severe and disabling.If you are not tested for ChickV then how do you know it is not just another virus causing the same symptoms? In Canada and the US we have winter influenzas that have similar symptoms in most people. People at risk are those with underlying medical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, heart disease etc.) infants and older people."
"A poster on the Antigua forum came down with it and has had symptoms for month, including an extended time of absence from work. It sounded infinitely worse than a flu."
"Agree MelvaOntario,the review on the Antigua forum, Sept 10th, re Chikungunya virus,post 12 onwards.This woman took all precautions,like using Deet everyday,and still was ill,with the debilitating virus.I think that it comes down to pure chance,if you get bitten ,after taking precautions.As long as the fogging is really pushed out by the authorities,and people take all the precautions,they can ,there`s nothing else we can do?"
"Well I've made sure I've had my flu jab - so if I do come down with anything, at least I will know it is unlikely to be a flu virus. However, I still think if people don't have a blood test they can't be certain it is Chik. As I said before a massive number of people have had a cold type flu in the UK (with exactly the same symptons apart from rash) - my entire family included. These things are often brought out here from the UK & US."
"Agreed Sunshinegirl024, a blood test is the only real confirmation,the rest is supposition.Maybe a blood test should be mandatory,if you are showing any of the symptoms,and it should be Free.I have understood from other postings ,that currently there is a charge for a test,this should now be free,to at least remove the scaremongering,and help people that need medical care now."
"Hi, we stay at Sapphire Beach condos and have done so for a few years but during that time I have never seen any fogging done. The condos are privately owned so would it be best to contact the owner to find out ?Many thanks"
"Surely in Barbados (as in Canada) lab investigations are covered by the national plan and if you are a tourist then by your travel medical insurance. I came home with very similar symptoms in 2011 from Roatan, Honduras. The tropical disease specialist ordered almost every test in the book (all covered by the plan) including dengue but they were all negative. He didn't order chickV but then it wasn't in the Caribbean at that time... or so they think. I'm not sure how they would know if tests weren't ordered in 2011 and if one only understood the medical 'system' in Honduras. That's not to say I had chik but I had something they couldn't diagnose with the tests they ordered."
"That's exactly what I did kitchenlady, see post 39 and if over the two months we will be there I don't see increased spraying I will be asking why."
"Yes, I would say that the Owner / Management is the best person to ask. The areas surrounding the condos plus patios etc should be fogged at least once a week at the moment."
I assume less in Jan Feb March Westie?
"The rash is pretty obvious, and my son still has that symptom, and some of his joint pain has come back today, though it isn't severe or debilitating. He also had confirmed dengue last year and this is different, even the rash is not quite the same. I agree that this is tough on older people. I can honestly say that I am not afraid of it for myself. In fact, I almost wish to just get it now and get it over with. lolEdited: 5 years ago "
"Would imagine it will depend on the weather NC -if we have a rainy Dec Jan - etc. will continue to be needed - may well continue to be needed anyway - sometimes during the winter there will be an ""extra' spaying one week if someone feels it is necessary."
FYI - if one does get sick and are not feeling well enough to actually go to the doctor's office to be seen - IF you are saying in the Paynes Bay/Holetown area - Dr Merzena Khan - (super lady) will make *house calls* - her phone number is:432-1806 cell 825-2722
Thank you ASO. this is great to know.
Are we sure that all hotels are getting rid of stagnant water. The hotel we are going to has had numerous reportings recently of most people being badly bitten because the hotel has areas of stagnant pools by the dining and bar areas. despite this being pointed out to them they haven't been filled in.
That could be said of a few properties. Last I looked (March) the north pool (closed) at Almond Beach Resort had stagnant water sitting in it. I wonder if anything has been done.
"The draining of stagnant water is a key preventative measure. If anyone has been to Grand Cayman, you will have noticed few Mosquitos ( I did not have one bite), as all the stagnant water had been drained years ago."
"the 60 percent is in a story about Jamaica, not Barbados"
Thank you Dave (I asked about that 60% on Oct 19th - wondered where it had come from)!
"I don't know if this post will ever be shown but Chickungunga is rampant in Babrbados, so many people have it. The good thing is that you won't die from it unless you have an underlying disease. If you look at today's Nation newspaper, the poly clinics can't cope with all the people I'll."
nationnews.com/articles/…
"We had the chief health officer do a presentation today at work he noted many of the cases were not confirmed but rather self diagnosed. In addition, they will be doing extensive fogging next week they said as a consequence of the population being virgin to the disease it has the potential to infect 35-65% of the population. A plus however is that once you catch it you cant catch it again."
Has Health Canada or CDC issued a travel warning?
"Leaving in a week for Barbados, staying at The Crane, and reading all these posts concerns me a bit, should we be worried or just bring lots of OFF? This is the only update I found in Canada last updated in September - Level 1:phac-aspc.gc.ca/tmp-pmv/…"
"I have been in Barbados for just over two weeks now and many people I know have said they have it, but only one or two of them have been to a doctor and they have got over whatever it was pretty quickly.  I do think that more people are ( think they are ) getting it because it's ""new"" and no one has a resistance to it, however, I have been coming here for a considerable length time per year for over 20 years and I have never caught Dengue and never worried about. Dengue is more dangerous and can be caught more than once, whereas you are immune from Chik after one go. Why worry about something that may never happen? We all still travel in cars , trains , planes etc !!! I really can't see why anyone would cancel a holiday because they MAY get it. Just make sure that your accommodation is fogged and take precautions yourself. --------------------------We have had the condos fogged 3 times this week as it's been so wet , it's just a question of being sensible."
Oh that's Great Westie - i was going to check if we were doing extra fogging! - very reassuring news - now if only Cabral would get fluidizer access fixed - things would be seriously on the up :)(please check your email)
"Tripadvisor is one of the most powerful online advisors. Chickungunga is rampant in the Caribbean. Ok it doesn't prove fatal and if you have it once you apparently can't get it again but it is not nice. This virus is rampant in the West Indies, I think that it is quite wrong to deny that it is so prevalent."
"I don't think anyone is denying that it's here SJ, but there is dispute as to just how many people have really got it, or just think they have. I thought I had it last week------------for a day and a half , maybe I did , but then I was ok.  Still no reason to panic I believe and certainly no reason to put off a holiday for it. Maybe , if I got Chikengotya properly or if I caught Dengue I feel differently, but I doubt it very much. I love it here too much."
"SJPape I totally agree with you. It seems things like this, crime etc tend to be brushed under the carpet which is unfair as potential visitors should be fully aware of what might happen,"
"I would point out to everyone that I should , of all people, probably be more worried about Chic than most as a sufferer of Rheumatoid and Osteo Arthritis but the thing is, I virtually don't suffer from it here, whereas if I had to live in the UK all Winter I would be crippled--------------------it starts up virtually as soon as I leave Gatwick Airport when I have to be in the UK at Christmas.ps Jane , will you still be coming out shortly or are you here already ?Edited: 5 years ago "
You are very fortunate Westiegal everyone is not as affluent as your good self.
"So you are still coming Jane . Oh, and I so wish I was this affluent person you obviously envisage. I keep inviting you to come and see for yourself, but you never have ! Maybe this visit ??? You would of course be very welcome .Edited: 5 years ago "
"Yes I will be there very soon, thank you for the invitation but I don't do socialising with cyber acquaintances."
Thought not !
"@jane and SJ - see below what I read recently....!!!!!Mosquitoes in Canada have become more than just an extremely annoying nuisance. As vectors carrying disease, they can be of great concern. Certainly in Canada in recent years a species carrying West Nile disease has been a concern.Now in eastern Canada, even in the island of Newfoundland out in the North Atlantic, a new species and potential carrier of Chickunguya disease has been detected.-...... Have also read that it is now in the southern USA too....! So I think Westie was trying to make the point that this darn virus is pretty well getting everywhere -I'm certainly not making light of it - it is definitely in the Caribbean - most islands are having a much higher incidence of it than Barbados has - at least until recently - (whether that is because Barbados has been fighting both dengue and chik by fogging over and over -don't know) - haven't seen any up to date % figures for the island yet - but a lot of people have been off work - but as they are not all getting blood tests - hard to know definitively. It certainly sounds a very nasty thing to be taken ill with - but that said - when one has a home somewhere - what is one supposed to do?? - We live, as you know Jane, in both Canada and Barbados - so we will be heading south for the winter next week( DV) - and will spray with OFF - use BOP around the condo - be thankful that our condo manager is getting the complex sprayed 3 times a week - and keep our fingers and toes crossed! - Beyond that - in the hands of the Almighty!"
Would you invite folks to your home in the UK?Just hope e everyone stays safe from chick v not nice but it's the tropics after all.
sorry typo in #78 - wrote complex being sprayed 3 times a week - meant - *fogged*Yes - we still invite people to our home - one's home is one's home - doesn't matter where it is :)
"Of course Jane , within reason naturally, but then I'm a sociable person, and I can usually tell who I want to meet up with. I ""read people"" pretty well."
"I don't think anyone is sweeping this under the carpet.. but.. as Westiegal has said.. many of those who say they have Chik-V thing are self diagnosed.. I know many people who have had it.. and it has varied for all of them.. Brother in law had it.. hands and feet issues.. rash.. but after 3 days was coming out of it.. another friend has been suffering for 3 weeks on again, off again rash and joint pain. Knock on wood I haven't gotten it.. but then again.. I've had some finger and joint issues recently.. but at my age, maybe I'm just succumbing to those normal age related things.. Fogging is being done daily all over the island. the best person you, as tourist, can do.. make sure you put on bug spray or lotions.. keep it handy.. My sister is here from Israel, for 2 months.. has noseeum bites all over her legs.. but.. still up and walking .. no symptoms or issues.. again.. knocking on lots of wood....You will all need to make your own decisions.. but like crime and other illnesses.. it can happen anywhere.. you just have to take the proper precautions..and Enjoy your stay..."
(not to hijack this thread.. but speaking socially.. Westiegal.. The American Women's Club Pie and Treats Stall is in full effect at the Multi National Fair on the 15th November at Foursquare Rum Distillery ground on St. Philip..hope to see you there...)

Somebody must be bored again and feeling the need to personally attack somebody. I think that is very nice of somebody to invite you over but sadly you decide to hide behind the computer and be your anti-social self and continue with your smart (a) remarks. Will you ever quit? Lets get on with the topic and keep your personal feeling about others that you have never met to yourself. I think everybody is fed up with your sarcastic comments. Please be more respectful and contribute to the topics.
Hey everyone - could we knock it off please ?- no more bickering - we really detest it -Can we just get on answering questions for OPs..... thanks :) - I know we went of topic mentioning chik potential in Newfoundland - but this is supposed to be a Barbados chik thread -n'est pas? OK :)
I agree ASO this is happening to much and somebody needs to stop. I usually don't say anything unless it is about the topic but I am getting tired of one individual's games. Back to the subject of Chikungunya disease
Given the OP asked this question 2 months ago here and on the Antigua forum and has not followed it up he obviously is not interested in any of the replies so let's just close this off.
OK by us damasust - you are prob right - maybe the OP is just trying to wind us up and has been succeeding!
We need a like button damasust. Definitely not something to take lightly and should be carefully monitored though.

Glad I missed some of the ugly parts. Lol
I didn't think that what I said was ugly. I said that communicating in a social medium wasn't too different whether online or in person. That's all. I didn't think my comments were rude. I deleted them because they seemed to be causing some posters a problem.
"Sorry Almatt, since I didn't get to read the posts (and actually didn't read the TA message from staff) I assumed they were just more rude, unnecessary comments. My apologies. I agree, communicating in an online social medium *should* be the same as in person but for some people it is not. They find it easy to hide behind the computer screen and say things I am sure they wouldn't say face to face. Maybe they use places like this to ""vent"", who knows.Edited: 5 years ago "

Keep well protected in order to stay safe.
"@ Jane - yes - spray with Deet 24/7 - use BOP around the rooms - run fans, have as much cross ventilation as pos. make sure window screens have good fittings, and if you have the opportunity - sleep under a net - Babiface (I think it was) mentioned how one can buy a pyramid type net that doesn't need to be attached to the ceiling - think she said Amazon - but have forgotten! - Main thing is try to stay protected - we all love going to Barbados - so this year will just have to be more vigilant and still enjoy our time there -Edited: 5 years ago "
"Yes, you can buy the pyramid mosquito nets from Amazon, they also do single bed sizes.I have these in my house and they work very well. They fold down into a bag and do not weigh too much.Here is the link for anyone who wishes to buy :http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pyramid-Mosinet-Mosquito-Net-Double/dp/B000R2DPNU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1415276251&sr=8-1&keywords=pyramid+mosquito+net"
Thanks for re-posting Babiface (we have wooden beams in our ceilings so can use the hanging variety of nets)
"Don't forget, you can protect your room using BOP, but if the room maids come in when you're out and about all day, they can let mossies in again. We learned this to our cost the first couple of nights, but then we got wise to what was happening. At Tamarind, if you asked them to spray once they'd finished servicing the room, they would do it for you."
"Sincere Apologies to Almatt - re my post regarding bickering. - This had nothing to do with you - and we wondered why you had removed your very applicable posts - our comments were directed at #73, 74,75,76,77,79,86, 91 - Nothing to do with your post regarding socializing they way we used to do with pen pals - (have commented often to hubbie - how we've developed ""pen/cyberpals"" on TA and are looking forward to meeting them in our home in ""real life"" )- so apologies - things got out of context!"
"Thank you ASO and NC. There is no need to apologise. I removed my post about making friendships using social media etc as, though, it was in no way rude, I felt it might lead to more bickering and we can all live without that.I should add, in an attempt, to return to topic that I am well stocked up with an array of repellent products for our next trip to Barbados. From what I gather, most people are doing the same. If I was a Bajan mossie, I'd be very afraid!"
Almatt - our manager has bought us zappers too - beware mossies! :)
"Got sprays, creams, wipes all with plenty of DEET and just bought some Papaya enzyme capsules.Just to add, if it wasn't for this forum and another one i wouldn't have met such wonderful, friendly and hopefully life long friends."
"We are doing the same Almatt... buying up OFF, clip ons and patio lanterns (with OFF in them) at Canadian Tire before they put it away for the season. This year will require extra vigilance."
"If it wasn't for this forum I would be in blissful ignorance of this Chik disease, so, this afternoon spent a frustrating hour or so on the Boots website trying to order an assortment of stuff to pick up tomorrow (have been away therefore everything left to last minute!). Usually don't have a problem ordering stuff but the Boots website drove me nuts, or maybe I was having too many senior moments! Remembering what Westie said about Vitamin B, just been examining marmite jar, wondering if that will do re the vitamin B, could bring some out with Ryvita for wonderfully imaginative lunches! Thank you all for info and recommendations etc. Also have Avon SSS but it's 3 years old, hope it still works."
Anne - Westie is one of the rare lucky ones - none of the doctors we've spoken with say B6 works - however it seems to do so for Westie inspite of medical denials to the contrary - so if you can;t find it - not to worry. :)
"OK, ASO thanks for that. Will ditch the Marmite and stick to a Banks beer for lunch instead!"
Way to Go Anne! much better idea :) - (ps Marmite is great for feeling faint if one has dehydrated due to lack of salt - very easy to do in the tropics)
Post 91 was in response to damasust. about the OP not adding anything since they posted the original question. Also my comment about was that Chikungunya disease should not be taken lightly. Nothing to do with the other posts. Sorry missed your other posts before you deleted them. I like to get information from these posts for future visits especially this one since I get severely bitten every year. I apologize for 86 but tired of the usual bully by one member.
Sorry GEM -shouldn't have included #91 - but this all got on top of me - and agree - for goodness sake everyone - don't take chik lightly - if sounds very nasty - so DEET and BOP - and if the OP actually wants to come to BIM - fine - if not - the rest of us do - so we will all act with more vigilance and still have a good time !
"So sorry you have to keep calling me a bully Gem, I do have a right to an opinion"
"Peace,we are all posting for a reason."
"Ann ----Please do not disregard B6 because of Canadian or any other Medical advice. I was told to take it by a British Consultant skin surgeon and it does work for me, so maybe I am lucky, BUT, B6 is available at most supermarkets, it only costs between £1 and £3 so it has to be worth a try doesn't it.  I wish I could use BOP, I wish I could use Deet, but I can't. I have to rely on B6 and Citronella candles alone , so why not just TRY it.-----------------it could help you too . ps tried Avon SSS when I got here, now run out , but no difference detected . Anyone who can use anything, should try them all !"
"Thanks Westie - Think I'll bring some after all, could probably do with some B6 anyway. Not sure what BOP is. Have ordered sprays and wipes with with Deet to pick up tomorrow. I've been lucky up to now in Barbados and rarely had a mozzie bite and always go in November, 5th time coming up. Mustn't tempt fate!Edited: 5 years ago "
BOP is an insecticide Anne - can be found in insecticide aisle in supermarket - By all means take B6 - won't do you any harm and if you are one of the lucky one like Westie and it can help? - use it too!!!!
Ann Start taking B6 asap before you travel. Have a safe journey.
"It isn't the first time you have been so described Jane E. Your internet persona may very well indeed be completely different than the real Jane E, and it gets tiring."
Thanks ASO and Westiegal.
"I would like to look into the B6' Westie, do you know the dosage and for how long propior to going? Can't say I have noticed if it is available with the other vitamins....have seen B12."
"In the UK you can get magnesium and vitamin B6 in the same tablet. I have been taking magnesium for a couple of years to combat depression, and it's good to know that the B6 will come in useful as well. Of course I will use insect repellent too.There is some useful stuff on this subject on the St Vincent forum - particularly a long and detailed post about natural insect repellent which might be of help to people who can't use DEET for one reason or another."
"Thank you, Nerbican. I will look at that post straight away. I much prefer the natural methods, as I cannot tolerate chemicals at all."
"Melva , my vit B6 tablets are 10mg and are solely B6 . I take one a day every day without fail, but you should take it asap before you travel --------------- some say there is no proven ""build up "" but I found that not to be true when I foolishly stopped them for a while. Good luck I hope you find it useful too.ps I also take daily Cod Liver Oil Tablets with added Garlic --------------------some say Mossies don't like Garlic either, however I take it in the hope my heart stays healthy--------------------?Edited: 5 years ago "
livestrong.com/article/…Melva - seems some people find B1 also works
Here's an informative article on Chic-V https:/…
"Thanks for that robiv, it puts things in perspective."
Thanks Westie and ASO. The article was interesting. Will ch ck out our local health food store tomorrow.
"When I was out in October there was no Off available in Supercentre at Holetown (or whatever it's called now!). Does anyone know if it is available again - coming out in December, so maybe I'll get someone to buy me some bottles when it appears again."
"I haven't seen Off since I got back 3 weeks ago, but they are stocking Massey Stores in Holetown with Go and Bop ( same company )"
Hi Westie - never heard of GO - what is it please? - a replacement type of OFF? -i.e. Deet or icardin/picarin (sp?)-
"Many thanks Robiv for that very interesting article.I wonder if any local person(s) knows what the Barbados authorities are doing ( or are strongly encouraging land owners ) to clear stagnant water, which that article highlighted by Robiv and other articles I have read suggest is a risk factor for the breeding of mosquitos, I think especially in wet weather. To my recollection, the last time I was on the west coast ( May, this year ) there was such water in a gulley ( correct term ? ) close to the beach between Mango Bay Hotel and Surfside Café in Holetown and also close to the beach between Colony Club and Coral Reef Hotel, further north on the same coast."
"BeachandSea - If you have been following the Holetown Beach Restoration thread you will have heard about the "":fluidizer: "" - this is a system whereby pipes were laid from the gully into the sea - and from the sea into the gully - so there is an exchange of water - (haven't seen it in action yet as we are not due back for a few more days) - but any way - this is supposed to keep the water from becoming stagnant - and restore the fish etc. to the gully keeping it healthy - All the work has been done and finished as of Ofct 21/14 - the only outstanding issue is the poor design of the ""fuidizier steps"" - which are apparently too steep for pedestrians to easily access the gully from MB to DB - - however according to last post from engineer - remedial steps are to be undertaken to made the crossing safer and easier - (Westie took a fall crossing it a couple of weeks ago)"
Thanks Anothersadowner for this update.
"Beachand sea The Environmental health people are giving talks around the Island advising on how to prevent mossies breeding ,ie dumped tyres, and any other water holding receptacles ( see Alex's post earlier) . Fogging all over the Island has been stepped up as previously stated and private properties are hopefully also arranging a step up in their own fogging-----------------ours is now 3 times a week, but I have to say I have not noticed other properties close by doing this ! The water in the gully between Mango and Discovery is not stagnant due to the new Fluidiser pumping in sea water but I cannot speak for the other gullies you mention other than to say, we are at present having such high tides, that water is probably flowing freely in and out of them. The weather is , pretty wet on and off at the moment, so it is down to everyone to take their own precautions. The local community in my area , and everywhere else, I suspect, are very aware of what they should do. I hope Hotels are being as vigilant, as many guests are arriving without a clue about what's going on.-------------------Are Hotels warning them I wonder ????Edited: 5 years ago "

Seen a few people on Facebook asking for the recipe or the leaves so it must be doing something for them. Good to know just in case.
"ASO Sorry I didn't see your post . GO contains Deet the same as OFF. I have been trying to use it with a thick layer of skin cream applied first and so far , so good, but I am only using it sparingly twice a day."
I didn't know chik affected your platelets like dengue does. One would want to make sure their platelet count is low before increasing it by this method. A high platelet count can lead to thrombosis. IMO a doctor is better equipped to assess and treat disease.
Thanks Westie - glad you are able to use along with skin creme
I agree NC - I think I'd want my doctor's advice before I started altering my platelet count. I believe the papaya has a diuretic effect too and I'm not sure that'd be a good idea for everybody?
ASO. Thank you for the natural remedy. Will share with my naturopath!
Melva - I got it from the naturopath's facebook page in Holetown! (Laurens Maas)
"Westie and BeachandSea re creek between Colony Club and Coral Reef - I emailed the Manager of Colony Club as I was concerned about this stagnant water and the Chik disease carrying mosquito which might breed there. She said that necessary precautions were being taken to ensure that areas where mosquitos breed are being eliminated (her words more or less) and although the area between CC and Coral Reef are not on their property, checks were being done on this area. I know there is an intention to get rid of this creek or stagnant water area between the hotels, but I don't think anyone knows when!! It's water which runs off the hills into a stream and collects behind the beach, becomes stagnant and then when there is heavy rain it spills into the sea making it unswimmable for a day or two, from what you are saying Westie this may be happening now!"
Well if it has breached into the sea Anne - then the area will drain - and the potential mossie site will be eliminated won't it?
"Ann, I seriously hope that no attempt will ever be made to ""get rid"" of a gully with access to the sea. Rain water has to go somewhere and WILL drain into the sea some how. To block a natural gully, is to defy Mother Nature, and re route the flow of water which will ultimately then cause serious flooding elsewhere, probably where people live. ""Getting rid"" is not the answer I'm afraid. What they may do, if our Fluidiser works ---------------- ours is the first on the Island apart from one done privately by One Sandy Lane. and is very much experimental , is install another one by Coral Reef eventually. We can but hope."
"ASO - yes you are right of course, if the old stagnant water has now drained away it will be a good thing, although it will soon fill up again.Westie - sorry, a bad choice of words on my part i.e. getting rid of creek etc. Last year when much was on this forum to do with the Holetown Beach Restoration work, I remember googling it and this is what I read -""The only other structure which is proposed in this area is a system to assist in managing the drain outlet between Colony Club and Coral Reef. This will include the ability to pump water through a pipe under the breach for water level control and a higher level fluidizer for breaching the top portion of the beach. Designs for this system are pending"". So I wonder if it will be similar to the fluidizer in Holetown. It will be good when it's done, I suppose it all boils down to available funds at the end of the day!Edited: 5 years ago "
"Yes Ann, that is exactly what they have done on our gully. Lets hope it is successful, and that someone comes up with the money to do another one. I don't believe that this has been a cheap exercise. ! We can but live in hope and wait and see.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Anne - once the water has drained from the site - it is easier to manage to control - they can fog the area daily if necessary - or ""lavacide"" to kill off the breeding mossies offspring - either way - once the main collection of water is disbursed - and drained away - better to deal with. Yes - If they do as Westie says and put in another fluidiser there it will be perfect - but the prob. is money -Govt. need a few really great tourist seasons to bring in some much needed revenue!.... fingers crossed! :)"
"This thread is getting to be really interesting. We had visited Bds nine times and had no memory of mosquito bites being a problem. Then in February of this year, we spent two weeks in Speightstown and experienced many, many mosquito bites. (Sand flies too). We attributed this to the body of what appears to be stagnant water just as you enter the town from the North on Sand Street. It looks like a canal but it doesn't go any distance inland and, although my memory may be faulty, it doesn't appear to connect directly with the sea. Does anyone know if anything is being done to control this mosquito heaven? We liked Speightstown so much that we will be back for a month in February/March but I hope this holiday will have less bite........"
"Thanks for the info ASO - interesting. I would imagine priority now will be given to those stagnant water areas in the more public places such as the one finiston has mentioned, rather than the one I've been on about between CC and Coral Reef."
"Sadly you are prob right Anne - but CRC have ""money"" - (The O'Hara's also pay attention to those things that might affect their visitors ) - so who knows - maybe they will pitch in and contribute if they can get the Govt on side!"
"Well that's just what I was thinking ASO - plus Elegant Hotels would surely contribute too as Colony Club is part of their group. I think it's fairly uncommon for the water to get so high it spills into the sea (I've seen a trench dug to let the water out) but now with the additional fears of problems with stagnant water who knows? What I don't understand is why the two hotels don't get together and somehow ensure that all the rubbish is cleaned out of it, which of course eventually ends up in the sea."
That is a great question to ask to hotel management Anne - (the rest of us have no idea) - perhaps you can encourage them in that direction? - Have a go!
"It may well be cleaned out now, I haven't been there for 3 years."
"We have spent months in the last two winters in Sp'town and you are right finiston, that 'creek' does not empty into the sea. The sea builds the sand up higher than the stagnant water so it sits there (under the bridge) and collects garbage. Like you say a perfect mosquito breeding area. I also think of the stagnant water in the closed down pool at the north end of Almond Beach Resort.... another breeding ground not to mention the catch basin for runoff along the highway that are full of filthy stagnant water. Maybe the schools or sports teams could volunteer to pick up litter at the beaches and along the roads and playing fields."
There have been school kids doing clean up duties - have read about it in BToday - obviously more is needed - but some schools have been trying to teach both anti litter - and the necessity to undertake clean up from others who don;t care about the environment
"Thanks to the wealth of knowledge and advice here on TA., I went and picked up some B1 vitamins and garlic pills (we do eat a lot of garlic as well, in our everyday meals) which I started taking today (leaving for Barbados in two weeks!) Mosquitos love me, I don't like deet, and prefer a more natural way of protection. We do have West Nile here in Canada which can be fatal, but is rare. Scary still, though.I hope it works!"
"Northern Spirit, will you post how well the B1 works? We are leaving in about a month, and I am interested in alternative methods."
Northern Spirit and Melva - suggest also maybe taking B6 (that's the one Westie uses) - and Avon Skin So Soft bath oil - both are supposed to help (and I did read a very strange suggestion in a magazine at the dentist that said if one put a sheet of dryer fabric softener in one's pocket - that deterred them???) - No idea if any one these things work - B6 didn't do it for me (after hearing yrs ago from Westie -took it religiously for 3 mths before going and large amounts every day on island - and got bitten dreadfully - (so had to go back to Deet - that's when I checked with Doc who said only works for very very few people) - so maybe take some icardin?picarin? (sp??) if you can';t use Deet as well! - Enjoy your stay!! - lovely island even coping with mossies!
"Northern Spirit, by all means try B1 but my Consultant Skin Specialist recommended B6 only. Not Marmite, not B12, not B1 , not Vit B Complex, just B6 , but then again, as long as it is not harmful to take them all, try anything going."
"ASO, I would agree the magazine article suggesting that putting a dryer sheet in one's pocket is very strange. Dryer sheets usually are scented, and I thought that mozzies were attracted to perfumes?"
"Westgal 3 : Many thanks for your advice re fluidizers etc re gullies. The last time ( May this year ) I looked at the gully between Colony Club and Coral Reef it had quite a lot of stagnant water which must have been a haven for mosquito breeding.NON Deet product. My wife and I have successfully used a UK manufactured, natural product called Incognito available as a 100 ml spray or 50 ml roll on ( currently £9.99 and £7.99 respectively in Waitrose available in Boots ? ). They claim that there is nothing stronger and that it has been clinically proven to protect against the mosquito associated with malaria. They also state that it has been fully tested and met UK standards for safety and efficacy. Its main ingredient is "" Citrepel 75"" It claims up to 5 hrs protection though we apply it more frequently. A key message we have taken from this well informed thread is to protect yourself by day and not just at dawn/duskEdited: 5 years ago "
"dryer sheets have been recommended for our black flies and mosquitos for many years. Tuck in your pockets and the back of your hat hanging down your neck. I've tried it and it didn't work for me!I guess it wouldn't hurt to take the B6 as well. I wish I had a family Dr. to consult! I've been on a waiting list for 6 months and just call ""the call"" on Friday (naturally I wasn't home). I doubt I will be able to get an appt. before we leave. I will, however, check with the pharmacist. I don't take any medications, so no worries there. I don't like taking pills of any kind, not even aspirin, unless absolutely necessary. Mosquito protection is a necessary one, I will definitely post my results!"
Don't even bring Aspirin to the island - if you were one of the few visitors -( haven't actually heard of any visitors getting it?) - who did get it - bad news to take aspirin - Bring Tylenol - _aspirin can cause stomach bleed and- that you don't want if you by some chance got chikV or dengue !!! -
I have got my supply of Papaya leaves to make tea but I understand you should not take it if you have low blood pressure.
"Northern Spirit --------------------I doubt many Family Doctors in the UK would have a single clue about Mossie protection.other than what is available in pharmacists However, it was my family Doctor, who referred me to see the Consultant about the terrible reaction I have to Mossie bites, and worse still, Bee and wasp stings."
"Beach and sea thanks for the heads up about ""Incognito"" I shall look for it in Waitrose next time I'm in the UK."
Beachand sea - does Citrepel 75 contain citronella ?(sounds as if it might?) - reason I ask is that there was a Canadian health advisory recently taking all citronella products off pharmacy etc shelves as it had been declared to be dangerous for applying to one's skin (if I remember correctly? - I did write to Westie when I saw it and she will prob. remember) -
"Anothersadowner : Incognito does not contain citronella. Its ingredients are :Citrepel 75 ( eucalyptus maculata citriodora ) , organic bergamot ( citrus bergamia ) , camphor ( cinnamomum camphora ) , linalool, limonene, citral. the last 3 ingredients are described as "" natural components of the essential oils "". All blended in a unique process. They claim that it "" protects you more effectively than Deet, yet it is 100 % natural"""
Oh good - that should be safe then - (just thought I'd mention about the Can.Health announcement recently - we didn't know about citronella !)
""" protects you more effectively than Deet, yet it is 100 % natural""Not in my experience. I would absolutely not depend on it when confronted with a dengue or ChikV outbreak. No way is it more effective than DEET."
"Ok bp, but what would YOU use if you were allergic to DEET ?"
"Beach, do they offer a link to the study proving it to be more effective than DEET?"
"WG3,Try a thin coating of XO, applied directly to the skin ;-)But that could get expensive. So, as an alternative, look for a product containing icaridin (picaridin in the US). It's chemically different from DEET so you may not experience a reaction to it. Along with DEET, it's recommended by the CDC for effectiveness.Here is a nicely referenced article by a medical entomologist regarding common myths about mosquito repellents:http://tinyurl.com/lztsk7v"
"bpfife, If XO really worked if applied externally, I think it might actually be less costly than a repellant. A 100 ml bottle of Deep Woods Off costs just under $10 CAN, which is getting close to 1703 pricing. XO is way less costly lol. Heck, apply Silver liberally, for a fraction of the cost of OFF. I will volunteer to research this option next month, however the accuracy of the results may be hard to verify due to the variable of external vs internal dosages, skewing towards internal."
You can get a range of incognito at Holland & Barrett. I'm going to trial their citronella deodorant and hair and body wash.
"ASO, I can use Deet, I think. I just choose not to, unless absolutely necessary. I use, the term Aspirin generically. I always have Tylenol on hand for our visitors who over indulge when they are here visiting :) Thanks for the heads up on that, though. Good to know.Westiegal, what I meant by consulting with my family Dr., was regarding mixing different B's and in which dosage. And living where we do, and being exposed to the many mosquitos and black flies come May, he may know of some other means to ward them off. I'm hoping that B1 and/or B6 works for me in Barbados, and I will use it here at home as well, and spread the word! I'd be a hero!And, ASO, thanks for the info on Citronella - I hadn't heard about that!"
Northern Spirit - suggest reading bp's link in #176 - (BTW - you're welcome - hope everything is OK)
"bpfifle : post 173 : from your comment beginning "" not in m y experience .... "" I assume you have tried Incognito - so you still got bitten ? Northern Canuck1 : try this USA web page for further reference : www.incognito.us/"

"Yes, I used Incognito exclusively in the Grenadines one year and it was like I had used nothing at all."
#176 link is an interesting read. Thanks for posting it bpfife and ASO for pointing it out to me. I had missed it!
You're welcome! - stay safe!
"bpfife --------------------Well I just tried the XO option and had mossies swimming on my tummy. Think they drowned before biting, or maybe they didn't care enough to bother !!! Thanks for that."
"Westie, for research purposes, was that Mt Gay XO. or Doorly's XO? To accurately include or exclude either one as a valid mosquiteo repellant in the study, you should purchase the one you don't currently have on hand and apply liberally and report back to us."
Smokey. I have on hand only MT Gay XO so perhaps next time I go shopping I shall purchase some Doorly's to make a proper comparison.
"May I missed it, but would someone explain what XO stands for in repellent terms."
"They are just joking around BeachandSea, it is Mount Gay Extra Old rum ;o)"
"Thanks for enlightening me Uktripfan. !On a more serious note it may be worth repeating what I think I read earlier in this thread, and that is to apply sun cream first and the mossie repellent afterwards. Seems logical !"
Yes i was told apply sun cream or after sun and leave for 5 minutes then apply repellent.
"I frequently travel to the US Virgin Islands (but look forward to visiting Barbados in January) so I have been following this issue. Here is the link to the US CDC (Centers for Disease Control) site about chikengunya. There is a lot of info. http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/As noted, it is the same mosquito that spreads dengue fever which can be fatal. I will be applyling sunscreen, then insect repellent every day while in the Caribbean."
"Syracusenewyork : very useful website - thank you.The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office ( FCO) , advise that ChickV is in the Caribbean but also advise that Dengue is endemic to Latin America and the Caribbean and can occur through out the year. They advice applying protection during the day but especially at dawn and dusk. ( sun cream first if applying this cream ) - but not to use products that say they have combined sunscreen and insect repellent, There is a health website linked to the FCO :https:/…iba.htmIn it they recommend Deet based products at between 20% ( 1-3 hrs protection ) & up to 50% concentrationfor longer protection ( above that % Deet concentration there is no increased time protection ) . They say that proven equally effective are Picaridin ( Autan ) at 20 %, and lemon eucalyptus ( Mosiguard ). There are lots of quoted clinical studies.They DO NOT recommend :CitronellaCitrosa plant (geranium )Garlic, fresh or capsulesVit B12 ComplexYeast ExtractVit B1Tea Tree OilMy feeling is apply it frequently as the repellent products are of no use to you stuck in a bottle - it will surely represent a small % of your holiday costs !Edited: 5 years ago "
"Here's an article regarding Chik in today's Daily Mail: dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-2…My partner and I are travelling to Barbados with our 2 year old daughter at the end of this month. I have to say, I'm a little concerned."
That doesn't help tourists who have saved all year for a two week holiday in Bim and have no immunity. They could potentially spend their entire holiday ill in bed. There is not enough publicity about this danger.
I contacted Virgin this afternoon to check that my hotel had got rid of all the stagnant water lying around by the bar and restaurant. This has been a problem for a while and has been ignored by the hotel. I also suggested they contact people travelling to Barbados to warn them about Chik and take precautions. This didn't go down well as I don't think they want it advertised. There was a piece in today's Telegraph about it. They have promised to get the Virgin Barbados Rep to contact me to check whether the hotel has been fogged and stagnant water removed. We'll soo what happens!
"If you take similar precautions as those you take for Malaria you will be OK i.e. 50% Deet. So many travel without the correct protection. The elderly and vulnerable are most at risk, Take Ibuprofen for the symptoms as it is occasionally in short supply but prevention is better than relief. There is no cure."
"FYI as ibuprofen is one of the NSAID meds -that can cause stomach bleeds - it is dangerous if one has contacted dengue - (and since it may be hard to know if one has chik or dengue without blood tests ) one may be safer to use acetaminophen - (i.e Tylenol etc.) IOHOIbuprofen -* This medicine may also cause serious effects on the stomach or intestines, including bleeding or perforation (forming of a hole). These conditions can be fatal and can occur without warning while you are taking ibuprofen, especially in older adults*."
"Hi All Have quickly read through the thread as I am concern about this virus, mossies see me and think oh breakfast ,dinner and tea!!!!! and that's with mossies creams on. I booked a Caribbean cruise and the next day read about Chik...so immediately cancelled! a week on I am wondering if I over reacted to the newspaper article!So providing you put plenty of repellent on is it safe to go to any of the Caribbean Islands?Edited: 5 years ago "
"http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/noticesHi Elias - think this is something you have to decide for yourself - if you read through the cdc travel notices - you will see that Chik in the Caribbean is still only listed as s level 1 warning - and the more one reads through all the other diseases in other places - from dengue, cholera, ebola, etc. there doesn't appear to be any ;place ""that is ""safe"" from everything - -to the best of our knowledge - Barbados is fighting the outbreak harder than most Caribbean countries, it probably has considerably fewer cases than places like the DR - - Chik is now in the USA - South America etc - so if you want a holiday, you probably need to do what the rest of us are doing - keep well covered with Deet repellent, if you want - if you are particularly worried buy a portable bednet (pyramid style) from Amazon - (but the chik - ""aedes aegypti"" mossie bites 24/7 so that doesn't help during the day) - wear long cotton shirts and slacks.... in otherwords - take whatever precautions you can against being bitten - stay in accommodation where they take this seriously, fog, vapemats, repellent etc.... spray your room with BOP -. don't know what anyone else can advise - this is something only you can decide IOHO"
"Hi,FYI.....This is a recent report in the Indepedent Newspaper - UKindependent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/sho…We arrive in Jan 2015 for 3 weeks...sensible precautions required...Regards"
"Thank you for the replies, think I might give it a miss this winter and look again next winter."
I hear that there is evidence that Bird Flue is set to hit the UK again this Winter -----!
flu strains also expected this winter apart from Avian flu - are H1N1 - and Influenza A (H3N2) so make sure you get your flu shots!
Is the mossie situation likely to be any better in January/February when it will be drier?
"Yes of course - the less rain the less it can collect in litter left around (great spots for mossie lavae) - so the less mossies - plus the more everyone uses Deet - the less transmission -at least among visitors, the more fogging that is done etc. the less mossies around - Bajans don't seem to bother with repellents as much - prob. too expensive - but sooner or later they will either become immune - or they will use repellents and protection etc.... so - I'm no expert - but that would be our guess - better after the rainy season ends....Edited: 5 years ago "
"Another good, though longer - term preventative measure would be make sure you have a healthy immune system, by eating very healthy, getting rest, and possibly taking immune- boosting supplements. With it takes only one bite from an infected mossie, I would guess it is a bit of a crap shoot whether that one mossie will attract you, since all,the DEET in the worl cannot. Cover every part of you 24/7;so the healthier one is on the inside, the greater one's arsenal of reserves ( Not that one should not use use form of repellent, of course)."
Whats the point of going if one has to 'Cover every part of you 24/7'?
"---Whats the point of going if one has to 'Cover every part of you 24/7'?---What is the point going to the English seaside in the summer when you have to cover yourself with sunscreen lotion in order not to get burned?But to answer your question: to chillax in the Caribbean, enjoy good food, drink a cocktail or two etc."
"Reading these many posts,I cannot quite comprehend the foolishness of the many who are trying to play down the risks of catching this dreadful disease.Surely it would be sensible to defer travel plans until the risk has gone, speaking as I do as one who contracted the Dengue Fever while holidaying in Barbados."
"People travel to countries that suffer from Yellow Fever, Malaria et al.There is always a risk when travelling abroad, just as there is a risk when jumping in your car each day, taking the bus etc.Each person will have to weigh up the risk for themselves and make the decision whether to travel. There is no one solution fits all scenario unfortunately.Those that travel can take precautions to limit the risk of contacting this disease. Similar to belting up when travelling in a car to avoid serious injury if involved in an accident."
"Quite right interlog - ChikV has spread to the southern US,and we have West Nile V in the G Toronto Area in summer (this can cause meningitis and be fatal!) - but somehow the airports in both Toronto and Miami etc seem to be full of travellers! - Either one stays home, wherever that is - or one ""travels"" to places one enjoys- - Each to his own."
"Good point, ASO...JOhn, I don't know if posters are downplaying as much as trying to come to terms with it..there are diseases everywhere, even at home. If we were afraid of everything, then we would nt go anywhere. Plus, it is at the Level 1 stage of seriousness, according to the global disease control site. I considered not going, briefly, but then I thought, if I stay in Canada the odds of me contracting another nasty winter flu, are pretty high, as seems to happen to our household every year. Plus, as much as I do not wish to contract Chik, the alternative of giving up weeks of warm breezes, turquoise waters, and total relaxation, is motivated an a very pleasing option."
"I went down with Chik 5 weeks ago and have never had anything act that fast? I had a somewhat resrless night and woke up with sore muscles, but I had fallen 2 days preciously and thought that was the reason. So I went for a beach walk and a swim. Two hours later, I was flat on my back in bed with a fever and swollen joints and could only get up with extreme difficulty. After 2 weeks, I was feeling OK, so I went sailing but found that I did not have enough strength. The exertion triggered a relapse with sore joints. My experienceis typical. This is not like the flu. It is a hemorrhagic fever that can cause bleeding from the eyes and ears and internal lrgans in severe cases."
"After reading Robert M's post, I stand by my original comments !!"

"Were coming over christmas to the Caribbean on a cruise ship from the UK (Barbados, St Lucia, St Kitts, Grenada, St Thomas) - reading about Chikungunya disease is worrying me. Hubby will be off to play golf. I've brought some 50% deet insect repellant. It is worrying and worrying me even more after reading Robert M's post about bleeding from eyes etc."
"Goodness sake everyone ! Stop the panic ! Chikungunya has run its course through the islands. Come and enjoy your holiday and feel blessed to meet some of the warmest, nicest people on the planet. Relax and enjoy their hospitality."
According to the CDC hemorrhage is a rare complication of chik and not a usual symptom. cdc.gov/chikungunya/…clinicalevaluation.html
"I was in Barbados Nov 7-14. It was unusually rainy for the first couple of days. I still did not see many mosquitos and I tend to be a target for them. I might have gotten 2 bites. I didn't get sick with anything until I returned to Canada and ended up with quite the cold. I am more concerned with the airplane and all the germs there. Just like anywhere, weigh out your comfort level and risk factors. Take reasonable precautions and go from there. You can't live life in a bubble. I would have regretted not experiencing this wonderful island."
Sandra - when you say it's run it's course do you mean it has a cycle - more prevalent at certain times of the year? We come every year to the Caribbean for Xmas - yes I know all about the wonderful hospitality :-) That's why we come. I've never heard of this before - it is only because it was in the news recently.
"I wouldn't say its run its course, we're here now and there are still signs that it's around. On Saturday the car hire rep was telling me that a few of his colleagues were off suck with it and last night an almighty and very noisy truck drove through St Lawrence Gap fogging the area, it was basically acting like a huge industrial sized can of mosquito repellent dispensing a huge trail of smoke, it was so noisy that it set off car alarms. So there are definitely still signs that it's about and you should take the usual precautions to avoid being bitten"
"You are so wrong! People are coming down with Chikungunya here in Barbados every day and it is a crippling disease. We have just arrived to stay at our winter home. Ten of our friends who live on the island have had it. These are ten out of the few to whom we have already been in touch. Some got it as long as six weeks ago and they are still very ill. Our gardener is a strong young man in his mid forties. He got it three weeks ago and his back and ankle still ache and he is not himself at all. This is not something you get for a few days and it goes away. It may not kill you, but it changes your life. We spend our days lathered in Deet which is not good for you either, but it is better than the alternative. If I were a tourist planning a holiday I would definitely NOT choose the Caribbean - all the island have Chikungunya."
"Well Janet, I assume that as you are advising people not to come to the Caribbean, you will be going back home as well? What a terrible shame, it would take more than a few aches and pains to spoil my winter here. Or is this another case of a 1 time poster advising ""Do as I say, not as I do ""??"
"Well, suggestions for alternatives .... according to Health Canada - ... Cholera in Mex., D.R., Cuba, Haiti, Ghana, ... Dengue now in China and Japan..... ChikV in S.American, French Polynesia, Central America, American Samoa - Samoa - .... and as for West Africa...... ??? - having taken the trouble to fly down -we will take the necessary precautionary steps of Deet, BOP, bednets, fans, etc...... and enjoy our winter with our fingers crossed.... can't see flying back to frigid N America personally.....@Janet - are these Bajans who have Chik or N Americans etc???...... we seem to have noticed that the Bajans are not taking as many precautions - whether on account of cost of repellent, or belief that they are immune..."
"Janet W - ""all the island have Chikungunya"" .......... so how come if it's so crippling the island appears to be operating as usual - hotels, banks, shops etc. etc. Mmmm !!!"
"If it was that bad we would be advised NOT to go, and I haven't seen, or heard, anything about not going to the Caribbean at the moment. If I had a holiday booked for this time of year to Barbados, I certainly would not cancel it because of ChikV. As AnnePenrhos says above, everything is working as usual!"
"To my knowledge neither the Canadian, UK or US gov't has issued a ""do not travel"" warning for Barbados or anywhere in the Caribbean. The only warning the Canadian gov't has posted is to be aware and to protect oneself... same as it has posted for ages regarding dengue.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Exactly, so whoever is booked to go, and is worrying themselves silly about this, DON'T. Just take precautions, a bit more than you normally would with mossies about, and you will be fine.Go and enjoy the beautiful island that is Barbados."
Chick v has affected people however many people are also self diagnosing. I think with the regular precaution most people will be fine. Advising people to avoid the Caribbean at a time when most islands are struggling economically is not sound advice in my estimation.
"I am in totally and complete shock and what I've been reading. Are you kidding me.. Chik V is not a hemorrhagic disease.. there is one strain of Dengue that is but not with this one.. and as said.. it's likely that that the cause would be more from taking an ibuprofen rather than an acetaminophen or paracetamol medication... people are causing a scare that really shouldn't be happening.. many of the cases that are appearing, as Alex has said, are self diagnosed.. My husband swears he has had it, and it has recurred.. in the joint of his big toe.. and claims he has had fever.. but.. no rash, no completely flat on his back (unlike his brother who has had it for sure), but yet, my husband has never gone to the doctor complaining of these things and been tested. I don't wear much repellent. I do apply Skin So Soft every day..and have for many many years.. Maybe this is why I haven't gotten it yet. or maybe the mossies don't like me.. who knows.. I know people who have been flat in bed.. and still having issues 5 plus weeks on.. I know people who claim they have had it for 2 or 3 days and are up moving around, no issues there.. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE.. Don't think the government or health authorities in this island aren't taking this seriously.. Fogging continues (sat at Berts last evening and watched the fog from the fogging machine on the main road waft past..) Bring repellant.. cover yourself with it.. and re apply liberally, just like sunscreen. go to the beach, take a tour, enjoy the island. there is always something in every part of the world in all 4 seasons. Take the precautions advised but don't not take your holiday because if it.."
"I can tell you what you won't contract while in Barbados: rabies or lyme disease! Rabies is pretty rare, but every year lyme disease messes with the health of many people in North America. If you miss the ""bullseye"" rash and don't get treatment right away, it can really mess you up. Bad flu viruses also don't spread around to the same extent as they do in temperate climates because we live in fresh air all year round. The flu spreads much faster in closed-in, climate controlled areas like you find in winter. We also don't have some of the other bad boys: malaria, yellow fever, cholera etc. And no Ebola (yet?).Added to that, you won't get bitten by a venomous snake, a bear or a lion. You are also very unlikely to be bitten by a shark while swimming, though you might encounter a box jellyfish if you are very unlucky, or a stingray, but it isn't all that likely. You also won't have to deal with an erupting volcano or a major tornado.All that to say, there are dangers everywhere you go, and the dangers differ from place to place. Yes we have ChickV and Dengue here, but you are also safe from a variety of other things. The best plan of action is to know what you are potentially facing and take whatever measures you are most comfortable with to lower your risk. I really think that those downplaying ChikV are only trying to encourage some perspective to this whole thing."
Quick question:Is it all of the mosquito bites that transmit this disease or is it a question that if you do get bitten you have to be unlucky to have been bitten by a mosquito that is capable of transmitting?
"Sunnie, I don't wear repellent at all, and I have never contracted a mosquito-borne disease or anything remotely resembling one, unless you count the few days of moderately sore joints I had a few weeks ago. It is quite possible to randomly miss these things as I have done, having lived in Barbados my entire life."
"interlog, you have to be bitten by a certain type of mosquito first of all - only the Aedes Aegypti and the Aedes Albopictus (they are black and white stripy/spotty). Then, that particular mosquito that bites you has to be infected with the virus. Mosquitos don't have a terribly long life cycle, so they don't carry the virus around for that long."
Thanks Bajanswife :-)
"Bajanswife, I know there are jellyfish in Barbados waters, but please tell me your reference to box jellyfish was in error. I thought they were only found in the Gold Coast waters of Australia.........."
"Thankyou Sunnie and Bajanswife for the clear, concise and thoughtful response to the Chik problem. Thankyou for refraining from sarcasm and admonishing people who are afraid of contacting the disease. Something that has perhaps been lost in the concern over getting chik is that some travellers may have pre- existing health concerns that make them cautious, whether it be an auto immune disease, a skin sensitivity to repellents or breathing difficulties acerbated by fogging etc. and as such they have every right to question the suitability of a vacation in Barbados at this time. They deserve an educated and reasonable response.Shame on the posters on this forum who have belittled, bullied and rudely told them to stay home."
"finiston - They are not the same as the ones in Oz - not so dangerous. Google it, I did it some time ago as I had a bit of a 'thing' about sea snakes and box jellies."
"MrsBB.. many years ago I used a product called Natrapel as a mosquito repellent. I ended up with a rash all over. I have had issues with dishwashing liquid (no I don't use gloves).. slight itching. I don't consider myself an allergic person, but I do have a couple of quirks that way.. usually an antihistamine works, but sometimes it takes more. People simply need to ask questions, know what the symptoms are and work with that info. Scare tactics don't help anyone. This is NOT something you die from.. you might feel like it.. but.. One of the Gentleman out at Berts with us last night, watching the fogging machine go by, said he got it last Thursday.. down for the count for a couple of days.. bothered an old injury in his left shoulder.. and was back at work and having a couple of beers with us last evening.. so.. This thing effects people in many many different ways..And yes.. as Bajanswife has said.. We don't take near the precautions, living here, that people really should.. but that goes for just about anything, just about anywhere.."
"@Mrs BB, a good post .I will chuck my ten pence worth in.We have just returned from three weeks in Holetown (hopefully with no ill effects)This is what we did. We bought an electronic anti mossie machine for our bedroom, not something we would normally doWe used repellent candles and coils on our balcony on an evening, something we would do normally.We used a Deet (20% strength) repellent spray on exposed areas on visits out and about, again this is something we would normally do but we were a bit more vigilant this trip.We stayed away from some places we would normally visit that have largish areas of standing water, don't know if that was called for or not but we thought it prudent this visit.I wore long trousers more in the evenings and OH was more aware of covering up as well.We were bitten a few times, don't know by what but we always get a few bites and with our extra precautions had less than we had last year. Speaking to many locals in shops petrol stations bars etc everyone has a chick-v story, they have had it or know someone who has. But who is to say what is Chick-V and what is a normal ailment that shows similar symptoms. It seems a bit of a badge of honour at the moment and I bet other ailments have dropped when people come to phone in sick.All travellers should do their own research and knowing their own medical history make a balanced judgement on risk versus holiday location. If you are high risk due to a pre-existing medical condition then it may be wise to look at an alternative venue for your holiday.We only found out about Chick-V after we had arrived on the island, personally I think a little more could be done to make people aware, a small leaflet tucked into your passport on arrival perhaps, giving us tourists a chance to arm ourselves from day one.We had fogging carried out at our resort, I also saw the big truck driving round Holetown fogging the streets in general.My message would be this.If you are generally a fit person with no health problems that are likely to be exacerbated by this disease then carry on and enjoy yourself, take a few more precautions than normal but don't let it spoil or overshadow your holiday."
"AnnePenrhos, thanks, I am reassured."
Hi. Just to say we have been here for 10 days now and not one mozzie bite. Doing all the things JG DerYak has mentioned PLUS bringing all non perfumed toiletries including shower gels. A previous poster mentioned incognito products which are deet free and these appear to be working perfectly for us.
"The box jellyfish have stung a few locals, but you won't find them close to shore in the middle of the day when/where visitors tend to be swimming - they seem to like the early morning/late evening, and tend to be slightly further off shore. They also seem to come in waves - they aren't here all the time. They do cause a nasty reaction, but it can be treated."
MrsBB I do understand that some people have a higher chance of getting a very painful case of ChikV and that they have to think long and hard about whether coming to the Caribbean (or South America or Africa) is worth the risk.
"Mosquito Repellents : I have just been looking at the instructions for use of Boots ( UK) Deet version as ""Repel"" ( spray, roll on or wipes ) and they suggest "" for best results apply and allow to fully dry before applying sunscreen "" - which seems to be contrary to the accepted advice that you apply the sunscreen first and then the repellent.What do poster think ? I will see if I can e mail their help desk for further comment."
Jungle formula advises application after sun cream gas dried. Reapply after swimming and if you have been sweating a lot.
Bajans wife - are you certain they really are BOX jellyfish? The reason I ask is that box jellyfish are lethal and can cause death within 60seconds.
"That is what I thought too, such as the box jellyfish in Australia."
"Northumberland-lady, thanks to AnnePenrhos, I googled Box Jellyfish and found that there are many different species of this creature, one of them in the waters off Florida and in the Caribbean. This species is not nearly as dangerous as the Australian Gold Coast one, the Sea Wasp, but it can cause irritation and some pain. However it is usually found offshore in deeper waters, not in the shallow beach areas.There is another nasty creature increasingly found in the Caribbean. It is the Irukandji jellyfish and its sting can be fatal. It is extremely small and very hard to see, but again it is rarely found in shallow coastal waters. It's been around for a while now and I don't recall any reports of serious jellyfish stings in Barbados waters so I'll still be snorkelling off the west coast in February and March.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Hate to say this, but the last two days I have forgotten to take my B1 and garlic pills, and have not applied any repellent. Not a single bite. I am loved by Mosquitos at home, but here they don't seem to be anywhere around. Haven't seen or heard any! Same with hubby, although he rarely gets bitten at home, as they prefer me! I am not suggesting you don't carry on with precautions, as some people with underlying health issues may have a problem, I'm just saying enjoy your vacation here!"
I understand from family friends that live on the island that you should postpone your trip to Barbados which we did when we heard that there are now thousands of cases and thousands more unconfirmed. We are traveling with 3 small children and to us it wasn't worth the anxiety and risk associated with Chikungunya.
"Northern spirit - if you have been taking the B1 &agaric for some time you will have built it up in your system so one day without wouldn't have made much differce, irrespective of its efficacy."
Another sky is falling One-Post wonder. . Sheesh. Anyone check if there are similar threads for other Caribbean islands on TA?
"Of the forums that I have seen chik is being discussed in Florida, T&C, St. Maartin, St. Kitts, St. Lucia and Grenada or did you mean a thread regarding cancelling a trip because of chik?"
NC you mean it isn't being mentioned on the DR? - thought that place was the worst of the worst according to Health Canada - Anyhow - they are not T-Rex -with luck and lots of Deet - hopefully we will all survive. LOL
"Smokey 66...I agree with you, unfortunately some mis-informed folk are panicking, and potentially making things worse by feeding the beast and making things sound worse....there may be 'thousands 'with the disease...but I think we would have read in the press if things were that bad.Normal precautions and common sense should prevail!!!Edited: 5 years ago "
"ASO, I hadn't read the DR forum but after checking, yes they are discussing it. I doubt there are many places in the Caribbean and Central America where it is not being discussed."
Thanks NC - thought they Must be!
Been here ten days and touch wood not had one bite and with all the rain we had we are near a lot of standing water still which has panicked me a bit but all ok (not happy about this but water works are being carried out in our road) my husband had a few bad bites on his back on 2nd day only diff being between us and it might be a coincidence is I have taken vitimin b1 and he hasn't.
We are at the crane dec 13-27th. Very nervous about chikungunya. Can you please tell me if you got it while there or if you noticed the crane stepping up there fogging?

"I'm going to stop responding, because obviously I'm an idiot.. As said.. every where in the world has one issue or the other.. so we might as well just stop traveling all together.. to anywhere..TAKE THE NORMAL PRECAUTIONS...even if you were coming here and this thing wasn't about.. I'd still say it... get repellent.. take the B1 tablet .. apply the repellent often.. The island is doing what they can to get rid of mosquitoes, but they will never go away.. No.. I haven't had it.. neither my 3 children, nor my husband.. (I was told on another forum that a nurse practitioner not in Barbados suggested that we have built up an immunity.. to what, I'd like to know.. mosquitoe bits or the Chik-V think. Some of us thing we have had mild symptoms but have been told it's just old age.. haha.. yes.. I have had friends and relatives who have had it.. and yes.. it's not nice.. painful for some.. bring lots of Paramol and Paracetomal and tylonal etc..(don't bring Ibuprofen type medications).. (and yes.. you can get these items in the stores here)..Even the Chief Veterinarian on the island said yesterday that the ""epidemic"" has subsided (and yes.. he has had it..).Come to Barbados.. Come and Enjoy the sun, sand and sea.. and our island.."
"Wise words Sunnie. We have just returned home after two weeks. As ever, we used DEET based repellent - this time during the day rather than only in the evenings. I only saw one mossie during the two weeks. I did get bitten by something when I was on the west coast one day - could have been something other than a mossie? Not sure. No ill effects to date. I got one more bite on the last day so will wait and see. I know people who have contracted ChikV. I think it's all about being sensible, doing what you can to reduce the risk etc. Aside from our hotel fogging everyday, we saw the authorities fogging common areas. ChikV is around in many parts of the world so it's important to keep things in perspective. Many worse diseases are also prevalent elsewhere so just go and enjoy your holiday and be sensible.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Sunniebgi - well said ! There have been outbreaks of Chikungunya throughout the world. Let's draw a line under this and enjoy ourselves in the beautiful Caribbean sunshine. As for standing water after rain: these are puddles and, correct me if I'm wrong, but daytime biting mosquitoes do not breed in puddles."
Nice one Sunni...why doesn't everyone just calm down ..and adopt common sense approaches.I am amazed that people are even cancelling holidays because of this. As far as I can see from literature Normal precautions are sufficient..there are no warnings from U K Department of Health or Foreign Office against Travel
We agree - no serious travel warnings from Health Canada either.Thanks for calmness Sunniebgi -Glad you got home OK Almatt -
"Rix4. Wish I was you. Would love to have a 14 night stay at The Crane in December.Relax!Let's put this in perspective. The mosquito which spreads ChicV is the same species which can spread Dengue. As such people should always have been taking the precautions now suggested for years. ChicV is new to the area and I think is catching out locals who tend not to take precautions. It is less dangerous than Dengue. I find, in general, you are less likely to get bitten at The Crane because it is on the Atlantic Coast so you get plenty of wind which keeps the Mosquitos at bay. It will depend on the type of room you have. Park and garden rooms will have more mozzies than ocean view rooms.The Crane has always fogged twice a week, no doubt they will have increased this given the current concerns.If worried, spray deet regularily and use plug ins etc.As has been said, whilst one should take precautions I can't understand people who make one off posts saying they have decided not to come? Indeed the person who started this thread 10 weeks ago has not even had the courtesy of speaking again after over 270 comments!Come, spray and enjoy."
"Day 6. I haven't had a mosquito bite since being here. Sorry, I did have one. Nor have I seen one. Hubby did! And he smacked it! After day one, I forgot to take my B1 and garlic. I have not been using any repellents. Sorry, but I just don't like them. Nada. Not bite not a sighting. Relax everyone. Coming from West Nile Land, I tend to relax and carry on with life. I don't like chemical stuff, so I throw caution to the wind. I don't recommend that for everyone if that's not your cup of tea. Relax, don't worry. Life is good down here in Barbados! However, I don't have any other health issues that may be a problem."
"How true Northern Spirit - ( from West Nile land ) - I wrote about that months ago .... actually got asked if I was inventing stuff!? - non Ontarians don't seem to know about it - - yes - West Nile virus can be a ""killer"" - and how does it arrive in our fair Province? - Birds! >mossies > people - anyone would think we are being invaded by man eating ""T Rexes"" here in BIM! - sure it would be nasty to get it - but with care - hopefully it won't happen :)"
"It's far too risky to take children there with this risk.I have been forced to cancel our holiday with no support from airline, hotel or travel agents!"
Any Brits returned from Barbados with Chikungunya Virus?A friend of ours is hospitalised with it on an IV drip
"ASO, I haven't heard anyone of late with West Nile, have you? Maybe it's a dying breed and the same will happen with ChikV?? Fingers crossed."
"Vince5, neither the DOH! nor the Foreign Office, nor the Government of Barnados has issued advice to people not to travel due to risk of Chick disease, hence why your airline, travel agent, etc will probably not refund, or your insurance company. It is similar to other parts of the world ...you just need to follow good practice and spray yourself...just as people have been doing for years. Use common sense.Think about it many thousands of people holiday in parts of the world where they can catch malaria far more easily.....they just take normal precautions ..malaria tablets...think how many people go to Inda on holiday!!! It is a pity you have cancelled...you have missed out on a lovely holiday."

"@Northern SpiritHubbie got a mild case the first year -2002- went to emergency - docs didn't even know about it - suggested he had hives?! - ignorance - it was only later that there was info on symtoms written in paper that docs (and we) found out what he'd had - No, not recently - all the Govt lavaciding of the catch basins seems to be working in controlling it - haven't seen a lot of dead birds either - been here since Nov.13 and sprayed reg. and so far so good! - hope you had great trip -safe flight home"
"Read in Barbados Today about the 162 cases of chick diagnosed, in UK tourists returning from the Caribbean.Leading Doctor ,a specialist in this field, has said that a small number of cases result in death and that 10% of patients will suffer from arthritis, joint pains, fatigue and other complications including Mycardilitis.Not a health issue to be taken lightly, as others have commented.Regards"
"Or you could get run over by a bus, fall under a train, be in a car crash, catch pneumonia.......etc.etc.We take chances everyday with our health and wellbeing.It will not stop me going, I will just be extra vigilant."
I have to agree Jill. Am I nervous about it? Yes I am since I get bit all the the time plus I go hiking off the beaten path. I will take extra care and apply spray during the day as well as at night. There are so many things can happen on holidays or at home. Does this mean will stay at home? I risk the chance of getting Lyme disease from ticks every time I go riding in the forest. I love to riding and will continue to ride. I'm not saying not to take this serious but we can't always live in a bubble.
There is no problem sharing information but some people are going to the extreme and trying to cause more fear than promoting common sense and how to take precautions. It is great to know ahead what symptoms to watch for and to take tylenol instead of Ibuprofen. All very helpful information. Some people have gone to the extreme with cancelling holidays. It's not just Barbados that has this problem.
"We sprayed DEET quite regularly, especially round the ankles and wrists so took no risks.There was a two and a half day tropical downpour the other week and almost every where had floods in one way or another so there was a lot of standing water for a few days, yes saw one or two people with bites but nothing over whelming. I knew two friends who did contract Chick and both had different reactions to it. One had it for around 10 days and one had it for about 4 days. Both were exactly the same symptons but the one who had it for 4 days was quite a fit person so guess being healthier the better.So just spray on a regular basis and hopefully you should be ok. I didn't let the thought of catching it spoil my holiday.Just to add about the two friends of mine, i know quite a lot of people on the Island so two out of many, many people is a very small percentage.Edited: 5 years ago "
Good to know Brett
"The following is taken from an article in the Guardian on Aug 5th this year, it refers to the Ebola scare--------------------------As planes get grounded, communities are stigmatised, and mildly sick people fear for their lives, it’s worth reflecting what the biggest threat to our collective wellbeing is: rare tropical diseases, or our terrible coverage of them.-----------------------------In his article he mentions the 800 people who had died at that point from Ebola so far in 2014, he gave figures for TB (some 600,000 deaths) and malaria (some 300,000 deaths) but nobody seems to care about the big numbers. These numbers are estimated by the WHO as no accurate numbers can be gathered.Dengue fever has been around for years and it too can affect a small percentage of people in a bad way but we don't really give that much coverage.If you are travelling overseas there are bound to be illnesses that can be caught that you wouldn't encounter at home, all you can do is take reasonable, sensible precautions. If a person knows they are in a high risk group and thinks that a dose of Chick-V could cause them severe health problems then it may be prudent to choose a destination that doesn't suffer with Chickungunya. But Chickungunya is spread far and wide and areas that don't have it may well have other problems (I'm thinking Australia with bugs, snakes, spiders, sharks, crocodiles.....)Its a numbers game really, there are plane crashes most years, that doesn't stop me flying. Same with driving a car, I could avoid both those risks entirely by not flying or travelling by car but it would make my life both boring and difficult.Its up to each individual to evaluate their position on this, just do't get sucked in by the media. The population of Barbados is generally in good health and I bet they don't take many precautions."

Clearly, many people responding on this thread have considered all of these things and made the decision to continue with their holidays - that was the right decision for us (she said whilst counting down the incubation period for the bite I got on the last day!). Others may decide differently and that's right for them."
And yes I think all that can be said has been said Damasust - no more from me (unless I develop ChikV and I'll let you all know!)
"Damasust I entirely agree, unless there is new guidelines from DOH or the FO, there is little to be gained from regurgitation of the same information. Take precautions and enjoy the island everybody."
"Indeed there could be some points repeated, but they reflect various opinions from those who wish to share on this site. Is that not the point of this forum? I like to extend courtesy of listening to others and being open-minded to what everyone has to say. Now others may feel that their views are not welcomed."
"BlodwenLancz I would certainly take a risk if it was just me and my wife travelling, but I would not expose my 7 and 9 year old to that sort of risk. We have spoken to people who have contracted this and it is certainly not pleasant.Many of the reports coming from 'travel agents' and 'tour operators' are biased to say the least. My travel agent certainly doesn't see our point even as though we have spent a fortune with them over the last 3 years!Lets face it, the FCO and the DOH would cause hell if they recommended against travel there at this stage.FCO is not warning against travel to Madagascar on health grounds as an example, even as though there is an outbreak of plague!!I am sorry but I absolutely don't agree with your comments. As a father I have a duty to protect my children and listening to the distorted advice of a people who have a financial interest in holidays is really not an option"
"Its pretty simple. Use appropriate repellant and you'll be absolutely fine. Same thing at home or here. No spray, you'll probably get bites."
"VinceF5 - children, with young joints, don't seem to be suffering to the extent that the adults are. They have the acute phase for a few days, the rash and some sore joints, but my son and all of his friends that have had it seem to have missed the chronic phase. My son was completely recovered in a week, with no residual weakness or pain. He was much sicker with Dengue fever. I honestly think that older adults are at the highest risk for longer-term pain and suffering than young people, based on everything I've seen so far. The chronic inflammation aspect of the disease affects older or injured joints far more than young, healthy joints.Edited: 5 years ago "
"I'm in Barbados now and can only report anecdotal evidence. SInce I got here I have not seen a single mosquito nor much of any other flying insect. My suspicion is that the attempts to eradicate the mosquito population have had some success. I am, incidentally, staying at a place where I have been many times before and where I usually get a few bites every night. It's been very rainy this December, but if it dries out as it usually does in January that should also be a big help."
"It does depend on the person, some are fortunate not to get bit some do.My friend is on the Island now and she's been there for 3 weeks and has had quite a few bites, hopefully she will be Chick free. I didn't get one single bite from my recent trip so maybe i was lucky."
"Google shows cases up to about 40 or mor by this past summer. US CDC lists Barbados as having Chikungunya. www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/geo/index.html. So does US State Dept, which gives good advice and links to CDC and WHO. Bottom line: I'm wearing a DEET product to be safe.Go to …state.gov/content/…barbados.html for updates and CDC and WHO web links: ""Chikunguya and Dengue are mosquito-borne illnesses that are becoming more frequent in tropical and equatorial climates around the world. Symptoms can include fever, rash, severe headache, joint pain, and muscle or bone pain. There are no specific treatments for Chikungunya or Dengue and vaccines are still in the developmental phase. Preventing mosquito bites is the most important way to prevent these illnesses. Avoidance and prevention techniques include: reducing mosquito exposure by using repellents, covering exposed skin, treating clothing and tents with permethrin and sleeping in screened or air conditioned rooms. You can also reduce exposure through mosquito control measures, including emptying water from outdoor containers and spraying to reduce mosquito populations. The Aedes mosquitos that carry these illnesses are primarily day biting and often live in homes and hotel rooms especially under beds, in bathrooms and closets. Travelers should carry and use CDC recommended insect repellents containing either 20% DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535, which will help diminish bites from mosquitoes as well as ticks, fleas, chiggers, etc., some of which may also carry infectious diseases. For further information, please consult the CDC's Chikungunya Virus Website and Dengue Virus Website.""Edited: 5 years ago "
My family and I plan to go to the Silverpoint hotel in the south for Christmas. Does anyone know if the chikungunya situation is getting better as the rainy season passes? And when more precisely does the rainy season end? Also any knowledge about where the situation is worse - south coast? West coast?Thanks
Personally don't know the hotel - but would guess the windy location (wind surfing/kite surfing) should be good for keeping the mossie population down - less than some other places - plus it is reasonably isolated - need taxis or buses to get to The Gap etc..... so probably as good or better than some other locations where there are more people..... the more people the more attractive to mosquitoes as far as I've heard..... - Only a guess ....?
"I had been VERY worried about ChicV before i came to the island as my hubby was bitten many times last year and felt a little untoward with the bites. So after reading this thread i stocked up on Boots Repel with 50% DEET (look at the ingredients), spray and wipes. We had heard that taking Brewers Yeast tablets helped too so he has been taking 6 of those each day as well.He's only had 3 bites, which looked angry to begin with, but we brought Sudocrem with us for sunburn and he's used that on the bites, which disappeared very quickly and he hasn't been dabbed since. We also spray the apartment with insect spray if we've had the doors open.Our accommodation fogged yesterday too for about 15 minutes.Take precautions and you should be fine."
Thanks. I'm counting on the wind being good for our cause.
Thanks. What part of Barbados are you in?
"We are Canadian ""snowbirds"" who have been wintering in Holetown (west coast) for the past 26 years! - Frankly all this talk of ChikV isn't comforting to very elderly arthritic people (hubbie is a WW2 vet - turning 90 this month) - but neither is the frigid arctic vortexes that seem to becoming commonplace in Ontario! - so we use repellent religiously! LOL"
We arrived back in London on Tuesday. I went armed with jungle formula and other repellents. I usually get bitten and react badly but I came away with only two bites (on my right foot). Boyfriend wasn't bitten at all. The only day I wasn't religiously spraying myself was the day I got bitten but that was now nearly 2 weeks ago so I think I'll be okay!
This is absolutely crazy..I have been going to the island for 26 years and have never used any mosquito repellant ...suntan lotion yes but this need to bask in deet day and night every day is ridiculous ...someone there please tell me why a vacation to Barbados is warranted before I sent my final rental payment for our March vacation. I keep reading this tread and I am thinking that our future holiday destination is not worth the fear of Chickv or dengue fever...Edited: 5 years ago 
"I have just been to our local health food store and purchased lemon eucalyptus essential oil drops (Can't bring spray because we only pack carry-ons). I will let the forum know how it works. Also, it worries me all these people spraying themselves with deet, as it is a strong chemical.As ASO comments, what are the alternatives to not going? Gettting the flu in the cold north? Andylulu, I would go ahead with your trip and don't worry."
"Andylu - did you get dengue during the past 26 years ?- we didn't - When there was a bad dengue outbreak some years ago - it didn't seem to warrant this this ""hysteria"" -( maybe too strong a word but don't know how else to describe it) - and from what we understand dengue is more dangerous - it is the panicky tone of this thread we personally find so unnerving...... - As Melva says - come back and relax and enjoy your vacation - from what we have seen nothing much seems to have changed - the weather is fine, the folks are lovely, the food is good ..... come back.... may as well enjoy it - Canadian winters are not for the fainthearted! LOL"
Andylu.......in the words of the immortal Michael Winner..'Calm down dear'.....
"I truly cannot believe all this fuss ! People actually cancelling their holidays because of an outside chance of getting something that's no where near as bad as Dengue ? Why ? This Island has never been so mosquito free with all the extra fogging and spraying ! Talk about mass panic . I said it before, and I'll say it again. Chikengunya is not as bad as Dengue, so for those of you who have come here for years and never bothered for a second about Dengue, what is your problem now ?  The majority of locals who have contracted some form of it or other NEVER, EVER use mossie sprays of any kind. Most wouldn't even if they could afford it because of the ""chemicals on skin "" fear ( myself included ) To hear that some people are cancelling their much looked forward to holidays is , to me, very sad for them, and very sad for the people of Barbados who can be proud of their efforts to keep visitors safe because they rely on Tourism so heavily.  Out of the thousands of visitors who have come here since the outbreak, just how many have actually caught it I wonder ?  The dry season is upon us and with that, I expect this not so terrible virus to die down to nothing. Please consider carefully before you exchange your holiday in the sun for a depressing time in the cold and snow. Personally, I didn't think twice about being here, even though I suffer from Ostio and Rheumatoid Arthritis and CANNOT wear DEET and rely on B6. The drugs I use daily, as I'm sure do fellow Arthritics , are those used to combat Chik anyway . and the simple fact is, when I am in the cold , I am in constant pain , when I'm here I don't suffer. Surely a ""risk"" worth taking ...............?"
"Been here five days now, and i have NOT seen or heard one mosquito, and i have been tramping all around the Island. I have sprayed with the Natura (avail. At MEC) eucaplyptus oil. As previous poster said, stay home and have a chance at getting the flu (and that kills hundreds of Canadians every year) or come to Barbados where the chances of meeting ones maker from ChikV are zero."
"IMO this has all been a lot of *hype*. Much like safety... use common sense! Spray with DEET or use whatever to protect yourself just like you *should* have been doing to protect yourself against dengue. I am at a loss when I read of people cancelling vacations because of the chance of contracting chik. Dengue has been on Barbados and through out the Caribbean for decades so why have considered Barbados in the first place if chik causes you to cancel? Doesn't make sense to me but that is only my opinion. We are *not* cancelling but we will be vigilant about spraying just like we are about using sunscreen.I must agree, I really think this thread has run it's course."
@Canby -sorry to hear about you getting the flu - we had our shots in Oct and hadn't heard anything about it mutating! - Hope you are OK now.
Was that this year Canby? You talk about Canadian winters I can't see as how a UK winter can be that much more pleasant...Yes I was looking for the rum (Extra Old of course) as well.... I think I know where it might be. lolEdited: 5 years ago 
"NC1, I left the UK many years ago because it has two seasons: One when it might rain and one when it will rain! Even after fifty years of Ottawa Valley winters,l I have no regrets. I still love the UK, go back there every two years or so, but the four seasons of Canada are marvellous.As to rum, I'm off to replenish my stock of Extra Old, but sadly I only have about two ounces of St. Nicholas Abbey left so I'll be bringing the empty bottle with me in February for a half-price refill. I agree that this ChikV thread has outlived its usefulness............"
"I returned a week today, all was well until Monday when I was struck down with the most pain I have ever known, there was not one part of my body that was not aching, high temperature and a rash on my stomach. It lasted until yesterday, my GP did some blood tests which have gone to be analysed. I did use Deet day and night and was only bitten a couple of times. Just be careful folks, won't put me off returning but I will be extra vigilant."
"I hope you recover quickly, Jane. It sounds horrid. I used DEET day and night too and still got a few bites (where I think the repellent may have rubbed off) but so far, so good and I returned a week today too. A couple more days to go until the incubation period ends.... and counting. Hope you feel better soon."
"Thank you Almatt, I hope you don't get it, really it is probably like a bad dose of flu. Have to add glad that I was in my own bed!"
"Hi Jane,Sorry to hear of your suffering and wish you a speedy recovery.Your symptoms sound similar to mine when I suffered from Dengue.How do you know that you did not get dengue rather than Chik?Will be interesting to know the output of your tests.Kind regards."
"JohnF, my GP said my symptoms were consistent with Chicv, I can only go by his professional diagnosis. I may well have had dengue but I await the results. Thank you for your good wishes."
Thanks for your reassurance everyone...when your sitting in Canada and your reading the comments about Chickv and Dengue on this tread it is somewhat alarming. We are again off the Barbados in March for our 26 year and we will have Off with deet packed and ready for those little critters. Our villa is on the south coast in Hastings and it has a grand front patio facing the sea and we enjoy our days and nights relaxing there so we will bring with us the necessary protection so we can enjoy the outdoors. Thanks again everyone for your insight.
"Hope you are making a speedy recovery Jane. It sounds pretty nasty.Visitors should know about the existence of Chickungunya and of Dengue, perhaps this recent outbreak will raise awareness of both.""Hysteria"" someone wrote, I have seen no hysteria, I have seen people taking sensible advice.If there are prospective visitors who have underlying health problems they need to make a balanced decision as whether to visit or not and in order to make that decision they need to know about both chikungunya and dengue."
"JGD,Very balanced comments, which I share entirely. Well done.Regards"
"Hello Jane, I wonder if you caught Chik in Barbados or on another Island, as I understand you were not here for very long before you flew to St Vincent and another Island ?  I don't believe that other Islands are being quite as vilagent as here in Barbados . I Hope you soon recover, it usually seems to last around to 5 days.Edited: 5 years ago "
"to the person who ""wouldn't risk his children traveling because of this situation"" and ""cancelled the trip and no joy from the airline, travel company, hotel etc... 2 things.. 1. as stated before. .there are no travel warnings.. so no refund is required to be giving, unless the tickets you purchased are refundable, etc.. and 2. what would you like us to do with our childre who live here ever day of life.. not just 7 and 9 year olds but 1 day olds and 18 year olds..?? should we send them to the north.. or out of harms way?? this is just really getting out of hand.. Common sense people.. seriously!!!!"
"@westiegal3, I was not bitten on the other islands I visited so having conferred with my GP (West Indian) and discussed the incubation period, he is of the mind that I did contract Chicv in Barbados, however he is open minded and will wait for confirmation, as you probably know this has to be reported to the relevant authorities.I am very pleased that you are interested in my travel itinerary but I do think that what is revealed in a private message should stay 'private' I guess the jungle drums at Palm Beach Condos are forever beating.Thank you for your good wishes I appreciate that."
"Hi Westigal,I do know and appreciate the excellent job Barbados is doing in attempting to reduce the impact of Chik.However, as a point of information with reference to your comment that the effects of chick would wear off in some 5 days, when I contracted Dengue Fever back in . 2009, I felt so poorly, I really thought it was the end of me!!Further, it me some 6 months to fully recover, although it has not put me off visiting a beautiful Island and I have returned again and again, without any further problem, glad to say."
"Hi John -- Dengue is of course much worse than Chik v , and I do not envy you having to go through a bout of that. In my experience, from the many people I know who have contracted Chikv , the symptoms generally seem to last 3 to 5 days ( as is also stated in a good article today in the Nation written by a victim of the virus ) I know of only one person who has suffered longer because her immune system is low following a surgical procedure and it has sparked off her Gout , but she is the only one of many. As I said in my last post, now we are in the dry season and all the standing water left by the November rains is rapidly vanishing, I would think this present outbreak will soon diminish and take it's place along side Dengue filed at the back of our minds as ""something we know we could possibly get, but cannot see the point in worrying about it. "" I am a fatalist and believe that if we spend our lives worrying about what MIGHT happen, we have no life.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Just FYI for anyone who does get ChikV and suffers from the chronic phase with swollen joints - a short course of steroids really, really helps tremendously from what I have observed. My mum was a different person after just the first dose! ChikV triggers a prolonged inflammatory response in some people and their joints remain swollen and painful after the acute phase is gone. For people like that steroids and acupuncture are both things that have helped a lot to counter the inflammation. I have seen people suffer needlessly when there are things that can be done to calm the body back down."
@Bajanswife - good to know thanks - hopefully not needed - but there is an acupuncturist in Holetown so could visit them.
"Well... We arrived Monday evening. I've have taken every precaution known to man! I've applied anti-mosquito spray since landing, showered with Avon Skin So Soft, sprayed with it too, used citronella oil and yet more antimozzie sray with DEET, I've even used ultrasonic devices and wrist bands, yet I've received 7 bites from the little blighters - and I don't normally get mor than one or two in an entire holiday. Everyone I've spoken to so far (locals) reckons they've had it - but I'm wondering if they've really had it diagnosed or if it's been a bit of 'man flu'Will keep you all posted!!!,"
"What do you recommend to do while at the beach?Are mosquitoes prevalent on the beaches?I know we want to sun bathe and swim, so any DEET applied will not last long once in the water..."
Which part of Barbados are you staying at?
Northumberland-lady - you mention you were using a deet product already? - what were you using may I ask? -( OFF works as you have discovered) -
"Northumberland Lady, you have really made me laugh regarding Man Flue ----------------------We are all saying that ""man Chik"" appears to be a lot more incapacitating than "" woman Chik "" -------------------funny that !"
"I have had full blown chikungunya disease.The pain was dreadful and my joints were sore and aching, it also resulted in me getting a chest infection which was treated with antibiotics. The rash has almost gone but I am still very tired and suffering from headaches, could be a combination of the change in climate. It has not put me off returning to Barbados, hopefully I am now immune."
So the lab results were positive Jane and negative for dengue?
"NC my GP phoned me to say that the school of tropical medicines had confirmed his diagnosis and I had indeed contracted Chikungunya, he did not mention dengue, I don't see any reason why he should."
"Hi Jane E,Sorry to hear of your on going issues with Chik and again wish you a full and speedy recovery.Others have almost attempted to trivialize Chik as being no big deal and hardly worse than flu, perhaps affecting one for just a few days.What would you say to them, based on your own recent experience of the disease.Glad to hear it has not put you off Barbados , nor did the dreaded Dengue in my own case.Kind regards."
"Jane, I included dengue because the symptoms are the same for both diseases until you go into chronic phase for chik or hemorrhaging for dengue (if it goes that far). As far as I know it makes a difference if you have been infected once with dengue as the second or third infection can be worse. I assume he would have tested for both (since that is usual and recommended by the CDC) but then I don't know your physician or the health care system in the UK."
"NC my West Indian GP visited me at home as I was too poorly to get out of bed, I had a high temperature, a rash had developed on my stomach and because of the pain I was in I could barely walk or hold onto a cup. I had just returned from Barbados, he was aware of chikungunya therefore that was his diagnosis, he took a blood sample, told me to take pain killers, drink plenty of fluids and rest. 2 days later I developed breathing problems which turned into a chest infection. He has made no mention of dengue.John F I have never had flu, I have never had anything that made me bedridden for 4 days and sick for 7 days, not even childbirth."
Jane I'm so sorry to hear how unwell you've been. Hope you're well on your way to making a full recovery.When I made a reference to 'man flu' I was not in any way trying to trivialise the effects of ChikV - I was merely appertaining to the fact that pretty much everyone I've spoken to claims to have been infected with it - when in actual fact it clearly wasn't Chik V - I spoke to a man yesterday who said he had it but it only lasted for 2 days - clearly this wasn't Chik V.For those who really do have the virus I'm sure it is extremely painful and debilitating and I wish you a speedy recovery!
rheumatologist-chennai.in/about-chikungunya-…
That is very clear and answers a lot of questions. Thanks for posting GEM.
Yes - thanks for posting GEM - I have copied and saved it
A Bajan friend of mine posted it on FB. He was unlucky enough to just get it. Thought it would answer a lot of questions.
"No offence taken Northumberland-lady, my husband very often suffers from 'man flu'. Hope you are having a fab holiday,"
Good link Gem
"I've just returned home from Barbados, love this part of the world and have been there several times over the past 10 years. I stay at some fantastic villas on the south coast. A fellow resident at the villas, an elderly Swiss gentleman warned me of this disease chikunguya, and warned me to be careful and prevent mosquito bites, ok I thought, being a well seasoned traveler I used repellent and requested a net from the villa staff.Regardless I was bitten numerous times, and like the prevention bulletins state, was bitten several times during the day. I'm a 52 year young active male, and surfing and kite surfing was why I was in Barbados. However I could not understand why I was feeling so stiff every morning, and old injuries from rugby, squash and running were feeling worse than if i was at home on a wet cold February day in Wales!After returning home 10 days later and after a night flight back home, I started to feel very unwell, by the evening I had a soaring temp, and every joint in my body was aching and painful to the extent that I couldn't walk. When I was helped to bed by my partner, my joints were so sore I could even turn over, it was quite frightening! After having a feverish sleepless night I found myself in the same state the following morning. My partner called the surgery and informed them of how i was, and of what we assummed was the prognosis. Speaking to the doctor on the telephone he requested that i make my way to the surgery, however i informed him that i couldnt get down the stairs, he then informed me to call an ambulance. I refused and somehow got down the stairs on my behind and was examined at the surgery, where simple paracetomol and ibrofen was prescribed.I continued feeling the same for most of that day, that was until the evening when It disappeared as quickly as it came.This lasted just 2 days, however I'm led to believe that elderly or sick people can have these syptoms for weeks or even months. I felt I had to write this long report as the whole situation of the disease in Barbados is either being brushed under the carpet or being ignored due to commercial reasons, which is of course a concern.What I'm saying is, if your fit and healthy and you contract this disease your going to feel really I'll for a few days and you should recover as I have, I just hope there's no long term issues. If your elderly or have a long term health problem then it may be a problem, just be careful."
"Northumberland lady, are you a doctor, or a medical practitioner who know something about chicungunya? If not you really need to carry out some research, as the journal states that it CAN effect certain individuals for several days and up to months and sometimes years depending on your general Well being.I have just recovered form it (have a read of my post dated today), believe me you won't confuse this with man flu, that I can assure you."
"PhilipP, so sorry to hear that you got the virus; hope you are feeling better now."
When were you in Barbados wjen you were bitten?
"Phillip P, you obviously haven't read any of the previous posts. I live in Barbados, as do several other Destination Experts.. The government is NOT sweeping anything under the carpet.. Fogging is going on, trying to education the public on what to do regarding stagnant water, and other means of getting rid of Mosquitoes has gone on for years, likely because we also have Dengue Fever which by accounts is much worse, depending on the strain you get.. I'm sorry that you got bitten and ended up with this virus. Did your doctor test you for this virus?? It's not that I don't believe it's what you had, but, there are many people in Barbados who have claimed they have had it, but have not been tested.. and yes.. continue to take the meds your doctor prescribed.and I'd likely , if I were you, notified the villa owner or manager to advise them, so they can make sure they step up their preventative measures around the property.. and strongly encourage them to make sure guests are aware of this virus before heading to Barbados...."
"Philip P - did you inform your doctor that you had returned from the Caribbean? - curious - because we have been informed that under No circumstances should one take ibuprofen or any of the Aspirin related drugs as they can cause stomach bleed, which if you have contracted a form of dengue instead of ChikV, could be dangerous - did he do a blood test? we were advised to only keep acetaminophen in the house for safety sakeEdited: 5 years ago "
"ASO,In my own experience, the dengue effected me for months and not a few days, so Phillip's symptoms appear to be Chik.Feel Barbados is taking the issue seriously and rather unfair to suggest that the authorities are sweeping the problem under the carpet as others have suggested.Regards."
@ John F - Hopefully you are right - it just seems strange that a doctor would recommend ibuprofen in stead of acetaminophen when he does not know for sure what the patient has
"Sunniebgi, I have read every post on this trip advisor topic and was up until the early hours this morning doing so due to my concern. You state that the issue is being addressed by the local government, however I spent 10 days driving the length and breath of Barbados and in doing so saw 1 banner overhead the road leading into Holetown. No pamphlet at the airport, hotels, tourist Information to be seen anywhere!As for fogging, I'm well traveled and have witnessed this technique in south East Asia, Central America and East Africa so I'm familiar with what it's looks like when taking place. 3 tanks of fuel in a Moke vehicle visiting every surf break on the island and I never witnessed this once.Was it really chickungunga, my doctor was very concerned with my condition and wanted to admit me to hospital, only when I informed him of the disease, he made inquiries and was convicted that is what I had. The symptoms were exactly as the journal described, down to the fact that it was my hands, ankles and fingers which were the most severe.I love Barbados and will be going back there in the not to distant future, I just feel people need to be made more aware of this."
"When I got Chicv mid November, I was already taking Diclomax for my Arthritis and Co Proxamol pain killers for my back as necessary. I am convinced that the fact I was already taking Ant Inflammatorys lessened the effect of the virus from the outset and stopped me getting the fever, I had to take 8 pain killers a day for 5 days,and double up the Diclomax to twice a day. the fact that I could not get up and down stairs or worse, to be a bit too graphic, get myself off the loo, without anything to hold on to, was not much different for me than before I had my knee replacements ( except they were done a few years apart, so I always had one good leg ) My incapacitation such as it was, lasted 4 to 5 days , the worst being the first two and I have had no relapse. No I didn't go to a Doctor, so I wasn't tested, but it hit me big time, out of the blue when I awoke one morning, and was painful , especially in my shoulder the second day---------so what else could it have been.?? So what I'm trying to say, is that having Rheumatoid and Ostio Arthritis probably saved me from getting the virus in it's worst form. Personally, as I cannot use any form of Deet on my skin, so use nothing to protect myself apart from B6, I now feel confident that I had it, and therefore now have immunity so I won't be worrying for the rest of the Winter. .Edited: 5 years ago "
"It is rather odd that this thread goes on and on and on when dengue, which is generally speaking more serious, has been around for years and is carried by the some skeeters. Mutating viruses have been around since the beginning of time (half your DNA is contributed by virus from tens of thousands of years ago). For some reason there is a fascination/hysteria focus on ""new"" illnesses, be it ebola, bird flu, or chic. Not to deprecate but it's not like malaria pre modern drugs. Use caution or spray if you must, mind the gap and don't step in front of the bus."
"I agree entirely DEA I only posted to try to stop older people or anyone suffering with Arthritis worrying about their holidays. I don't use Mosquito protection so I suppose it was inevitable I would get it. Most people can help themselves and prevent it.  I also believe that now it is the dry season, it will virtually die out with all the extra fogging going on .Edited: 5 years ago "
"John FYes your correct, I'm in error stating that they are sweeping it under the carpet, what I really meant to say is it's miss information/ lack of information that concerns me. I don't want to harp on about it, I'm a healthy keep fit type of guy and 2 days in Bed and a stiffness for a week is just a bit of an inconvenience. I'm no expert, but what about the guy from the cold countries who's taking his elderly mum out to the sunshine for Christmas to alleviate her arthritis.Just make them aware, it's they're decision after that. You wouldn't take your pregnant wife to visit someone with chickenpox would you!"
She's not my wife and she's not pregnant.
"tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g147262-i230-k80…this thread tells about the Govt issuing an ""advisory to visitors"" about the virus, and its efforts at eradication and what steps they should undertake for prevention"
What is the incubation period for ChicV?
I agree it helps to know before you travel about chikungunya. I can't understand if you do your research why you wouldn't know. As a result we were careful when out and about in the day and at night and used deet. I do however feel it needs to be put in perspective we have just returned this morning from another amazing three weeks in Barbados and neither of us had one bite. We didn't use deet when at the pool or beach at Port St Charles where we stopped I couldn't stand the thought of having it on all day and knowing that neither of us had been bitten before in the day there in numerous visits we took the chance. We spoke to friends on the island who had it and yes one young fit guy had it for a month and was really ill so it isn't nice but he admitted not wearing deet. I think if you take precautions you will be unlucky to catch it. Please don't let it ruin your holiday worrying about it.
"The rate of infection has dropped quite dramatically apparently - I got it at the end of October and as someone who lives here, am sure the main reason I got it and many other residents got it, is because most people living here hardly ever use repellant - we are so used to living with mosquitoes all year round.It is not a nice illness and I still have a few aches and pains associated with it 7 weeks on but on the whole am pretty much back to normal thankfully.For anyone coming over for holidays just take sensible precautions and you most likely will be fine."
"Re Ibuprofen, I used Panadol for the first 4 weeks I had Chikungunya and went to see my doctor here in Barbados as the aches and pains were really starting to get me down - he prescribed Ibuprofen and it worked a treat - within 2 hours of taking my first tablet I was pain free. I think once it is established that you have ChikV rather than Dengue there is no problem with Ibuprofen."
Good to know Scary - wait until it is confirmed to be Chik before using ibprofen

"I agree with Phillip, there should be more information available about dengue and chickungunya.@uktripfan, having been to Barbados before I didn't feel the need to research into any new ailments that are about, I arrived in blissful ignorance and I'm sure many other visitors did the same."
WestigalHave you tried incognito I don't think it contains Deet and it certainly worked for us over a three week stay on the Island - just a thought :)
"Thanks for that kitchenlady, but I find B6 works for me in general and I'm in Barbados too long to be putting stuff on my skin all the time. Anyway, by all accounts I'm immune to Chic v now. I will remember your suggestion if I ever start getting bitten a lot though."
Surely you have to be bitten by a mozzie to get Chicv.just saying
"Of course I was bitten Jane There were far more mosquitos around in November than usual as we had more rain than normal, and I did feel one or two bites around my ankles in the early mornings, but the B6 seems to stop me reacting to them so I don't really worry about them.  My experience of Chik v was of course, no where near as bad as yours, but as I said , I was already taking the necessary medication when I contracted it , which I believe tempered the affects considerably."
"On the 6th of December WG wrote ""This Island has never been so mosquito free ""On the21st of December WG wrote ""There were far more mosquitos around in November than usual""Well which was it I wonder."
"Sorry, but what is ""incognito?"""
"MarnieRiley, it's a bug repellent, which is more natural than DEET. I don't think you can get it in Canada. There's also another natural one, which is citronella called Buzz Away, which also is not available in Canada. However, it is available in Barbados; I bought it a vitamin/health food shop in Bridgetown."
JG - considering it was November - it was less buggy than it might have been owing to the constant fogging - so there were less than there could have been under the circumstances - but none the less - owing to the excessive amount of rain - there were more mossies than there would have been otherwise due to the fogging campaign
"I've been back four days now. I had one bite, which I think was a sand fly bite, my husband had none. We didn't see a single mozzie on our whole 10 day trip. This is unusual, so the fogging must be having a strong effect. Looking at the people on the beach and hotel we stayed in I only saw one person in that 10 days with 2 noticeable bites. I was looking !We really drenched ourselves in deet and it seemed that everyone at our hotel was aware and did likewise. We're already booked to come back next year with kids and I'm sure if we use the same precaution it will be ok.Generally I always got badly bitten on all islands I've visited, I mean really badly bitten. Now I've started the deet regime through the day I will always do this regardless of Chik V or Dengue. We started on Boots 50% deet aerosol and when that ran out bought Off 15% at Masseys in Holetown. We found the aerosol was much easier to apply than gel or pump action. You tend to use more with the aerosol but hey it was worth it !!!First holiday without mozzie bites ! Why didn't I do this before ."
"JD --------------. I contracted Ckicv v the second week in November when we had a good bit of rain followed by 2 and a half days of constant rain some of Monsoon proportions, and despite constant fogging by the Government and ourselves privately 3 times a week , inevitably there was much standing water around on our lawns and flower beds . As you must realise, things dry out pretty quickly in the hot sun, and by the third week in November our garden was as dry as a bone and mossies were virtually un-noticeable. Despite all the outside precautions taken ( even down to not filling our individual foot baths), there were , inevitably, more mossies about at the time I was obviously bitten, and as I am unable to use repellent and use only Citronella candles in in my sitting room of an evening , I fell pray to one. -----------My condo is in our very verdant garden which also probably didn't help. I hope this answers your question .Edited: 5 years ago "
"westiegal,How bad was your ChickV? Do you still have symptoms?"
"@pineapplepunch, this is why I keep saying there should be greater awareness of both dengue and chickungunya, leaflets given to visitors on arrival perhaps. It would give everyone the chance to prepare."
There was an info in the papers - that Govt advisory to visitors as you suggest is now occurring -leaflets being given to hotels to give to visitors we understand
"I don't really know what else can be done to inform future visitors of this virus. In the UK we have info on the Foreign Office travel advisory website, we've had multiple articles in the national papers and we've got this amazing forum and super informative thread. This is where I found out about and suitably drenched myself in deet. I smelt bad but I didn't get the dreaded mozzie bites.Maybe there could be something at the port of entry. It could be possible to pass flyers to the incoming travellers at the airport and seaport. I'm really undecided and unsure as to who holds responsibility to inform.All I know is that when I arrived in early December every single person I spoke to in Holetown was aware of the virus before they arrived, and sought protection as advised.I hope lot's of future travellers come to this thread and see how easy it is to be protected. Spray, spray and spray again !!!! Merry Christmas xx"
"""Maybe there could be something at the port of entry.""At least as of mid-November, there are two large full-color posters in the arrivals hall at GAIA warning of the virus. One at the start of the immigration queue and the other in the baggage claim area."
"I didn't see anything at the airport but then I was barely awake. I was awake enough to spray myself in the line at immigration, as were numerous others."
"Like you said, pineapple punch, it's hard to know what else could be done to tell people before they leave home."
"If I'm travelling to somewhere outside of where I live, I expect to take responsibility."
"I totally agree Almatt. So let's just keep the message going. Spray, spray and spray again. It's really that simple. No need for drama just simple precaution."
"Exactly, no need for a drama. I went out early November and there was nothing at the airport to inform of chikungunya, we found out in the bar that night, went out next day and geared up and had no problem.Its good they have now put posters up.Local Govt and tourist associations etc must be in a bit of a quandary whether to inform or not as they could put off visitors which would then have an adverse affect on the economy (which is a bit shaky anyway). Almatt, I agree that we all take the ultimate responsibility but a little help doesn't go amiss. We advertise flu jabs in the UK to remind people to get shots if they want to, I don't consider that to be causing hysteria, I consider that to be good practice. On the motorway I read the matrix signs warning me of potential hazards further down the road, I am still responsible for my vehicle but I have had a chance to prepare for any possible unexpected hazard."
"We just returned home from 12 days Barbados (west coast) and 7 days Royal Clipper. On the Island, we used repellant when going out in the evenigs. We lit a mosquito coil for the guys who might have come in with us thru the door (did not let it burn all night. Just a 2 - 3 hours). We used the A/C when not in the room in the evening. We had a net at the balcony door for the night. We had not one mosquito bite. We didn't even see one. I am happy. But we also did our part.Happy Holidays!!Edited: 5 years ago "
"Beantonka, that's pretty much what we did, only extra was an electronic vape machine for the bedroom. We had no problems."
FYI all - There have been notices up at the Grantley Adams airport for the last few months...
I have just returned from 10 days in Barbados. Stayed at Almond Beach. I was aware of Chikv from this forum before travelling. I saw the posters clearly displayed at the airport. The hotel fogged regularly and we sprayed with 50% DEET throughout the day. For the record we didn't see one mosquito and we had a brilliant time.
It's good that there are now posters at the airport. Shame it took so long to do it !
The posters at the airport were there when we arrived in mid November.....? - see post #403 & #395 tooEdited: 5 years ago 
"Holy smokes! I didn't know this disease was so serious and nasty. I ran across it two months ago, and read it hasn't reached Barbados yet. Oh well. I'm not gonna cancel my trip because of it. I think that's a little extreme. There are diseases everywhere. But I really do not need to catch it, especially since the symptoms can last up to a year.But I was in Puerto Rico in December, and Aruba in April, and didn't see a SINGLE mosquito. But my uncle went to Dominican Republic and came back with Dengue Fever. Are they only out certain months?This really makes things complicated. Now instead of site seeing the first day, I'm gonna be shopping for mosquito spray!"
"Buy Off in any US drugstore before you depart - put in luggage - then you have it here - and buy repellent ""wipes"" too if you can find them - keep those in your hand luggage -We've been here (Canadians from Ontario) since mid Nov. - using Off - no problems - Enjoy your trip"
"We're only bringing carry ons, and I don't think they will allow it, as they confiscated our sun screen last time we flew.But it sounds like the whipes would be okay. Do they have Off in Barbados too?Whatever. If we catch it, we catch it. We'll have a great story to tell."
Yes you can buy Off in Barbados. Wipes are good for carry on bags though.
BrianS we have just returned and had a trouble free time using repellent I am sure you will be fine. Agree with Almatt we found the wipes really useful to carry in my bag whilst out and about and at least they will keep you going until you get chance to shop. Have a lovely trip!
"Find Off and similar products in the supermarkets in the aisle with ""repellents"" - you can also use insecticide spray in your room (BOP or Baygon) against any errant mosquitoes that may have entered... spray under the furniture and in the closets."
Look for Ben's insect repellent wipes - made byTender Corp. Littleton NHwww.bens30.comphone 1-800-258-4696
Do they sell the wipes in Barbados or just the spray?
"Thanks ASO, first time I have seen After Sting for jellyfish stings although it is out of stock. I have used the Ben's wipes before in Ontario and they seemed to work ok for me."
"Another more natural repellent, and which is supported by the CDC, is Oil of Lemon Eucalpytus: They are essential oils which one dilutes in water; I bought them at my local health food store (a tiny bottle goes a long way). However, I just found many esssential oils in the pharmacy section at Massy's in Holetown. They seem actually cheaper than at home.We have been using this and touch wood, have had no problems. Also, it seems to be getting much drier, here (we are in BB now) fewer showers, and we rarely see insects, other than a few flies and sand flies."
It is there. My mother-in-law was just diagnoised with it and she lives in Barbados.
"ASO wrote""The posters at the airport were there when we arrived in mid November.....? -""I arrived early November and I didn't see any posters but regardless of exactly when in November they went up the fact remains it is about a year after chikingunya came to the island so way too little and way too late."
Takiyah W nobody is saying it isn't there. Some of the people that have posted in this link have had it. The issue is being aware that it is there and to try and prevent it as much as possible. Hope your mother in law has a speedy recovery.
"JD----- I'd be interested in hearing what evidence you have that Chikengunya was in Barbados a year ago? I was not aware of it until I returned in October and I was there until the middle of May and back in in August and half September. I did not hear of one single case at that time, .and none of my friends had contracted it , whereas when I returned on 14th October everyone was saying they had it , diagnosed or not !Edited: 5 years ago "
"As reported in many sources, including the one below:http://tinyurl.com/p33lj5q""The first case of chikungunya recorded in Barbados was on June 3, in a visitor who had travelled from another Caribbean country."""
"Thanks for that bpfife. I knew it wasn't there a year ago and certainly none of my friends who live there had heard of it or anyone having it in August, It seemed to take hold in late September., early October, hence the signs only going up at the Airport in early November when ASO arrived.Edited: 5 years ago "
"'@westieIn December 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported cases of chikungunya in Saint Martin. Additional cases were reported in other islands in the Caribbean. This is the first time that local transmission of chikungunya has been reported in the Americas. CDC recommends that travelers to the Caribbean protect themselves from mosquito bites.from the CDC website"
"Ok I stand corrected only 5 months to get a couple of posters up, that's a lot better.It's still an epic fail in my bookI don't understand why you residents get so defensive about chikingunya, people need to know !!"
"I don't think there is any doubt at all that people DO know JD That is unless they never read a newspaper or of course TA ! However, I think enough has been written on here now, and continuing to labour the point serves no real purpose.Edited: 5 years ago "
Apart from to keep this thread at the top of the list to be read by future visitors.Bajan authorities will have known about this disease months before it finally arrived on the island and did nothing. And really two posters at the airport is pathetic (but better than nothing) bearing in mind how many millions of dollars gets spent on the island each year by visitors.
Excuse me JG - not quite accurate -the Bajan Govt has been fighting mosquitoes for years with the fogging program - long before ChikV was ever heard of - simply because the aedes aegypti mosquito carries Dengue fever - a far more serious disease which has been on the island for decades I believe.
As someone who who has suffered from chikungunya and is still suffering from it I find it difficult to comprehend how folks try and trivialise the disease.
"I think you were very unlucky Jane . I have had no further problems whatsoever. Maybe I was lucky. I found it better to keep going throughout the 5 days I had it to avoid stiffening up further, but then I had no fever. and I suppose having been around horses all my life I have a pretty high pain threshold-----------."
"If the comment about ""trivializing"" was directed at Me - sorry- I am not trivializing anything - certainly both ChikV and Dengue must be very nasty and painful - However I had heard -possibly in error??? that Dengue was more likely to prove fatal if one contracted the strain that causes internal bleeding."
"There are 4 strains of Dengue.. one being hemorrhagic which can cause death and has.. Children to old people.. I don't believe anyone is trivializing ChikV.. however.. and I don't think there are ""millions of dollars spent by tourists on the island"".. and to be honest with you, that income doesn't go to the government health services, who would be people people dealing with this issues,.. what would you like us, as a country to do.. stand at the airport and hand out flyers.. that cost money that the government doesn't have. Maybe the Travel Agents and websites that book your travel to Barbados can assist by advising clients of the potential dangers of this virus (along with that of Dengue) .. The hotels can put a little flyer in your room, or the villa's.. but again.. who's paying for it?? out of who's budget?? (it shouldn't even be a question.. but it will be)As said.. The government of Barbados has for many years had a mosquito program in place.. Fogging, stagnant water.. they do send Health Officers out to check out peoples homes as well as businesses etc... They are vigilant.. unlike some places..Knock on Wood. I don't use any repellent.. hardly.. I put Skin-So-Soft original oil on when I step out of the shower. .. I'm pretty sure I haven't had ChikV.. (and most people I know have said I would know, except a nurse told me it's possible to have it and not have all the hard aching symptoms..). I would like to see a requirement that everyone who has claimed to have it, needs to be tested.. the same with Dengue (which both my husband and I have had.. our children, who live in the same house with us and don't use repellent on a regular basis, haven't had it either.. and know.. we haven't ""built up a tolerance.. just doesn't happen)What we don't want, is people running for cover and causing a mass panic.. Calm sensible conversations is what it should be about.."
Thanks Sunniebgi for a great post - Merry Christmas
Well said Sunniebgi......it's all about keeping a grip on reality and getting on with life and adopting common sense approaches. There is already another thread where some advice is being given about only using bottled water........what next !
"Hows about walking around with a Mosquito net over your head Blodwent.  Seriously I believe fresh Barbadian water is a damn site safer than bottled water -------------------who knows whats in that . Now London water, that's a different kettle of fish all together ,"
Oh and well said Sunnie from me too merry Christmas .
"Sunnie!!! Thank you for the posting. People Forget, they also have a responsibility to inform themselves. 10 years ago, that might have been difficult. But nowadays with Internet - no Problem. Thank you again. Merry Christmas to you and yours!!!"
The first time I went to Barbados I had a horrible reaction to sand fly bites on both legs. It was so bad that a local bar owner took me to the local doctor who prescribed some antihistamines to soothe my itchy madness. He also told me that I was now immune to further bite reactions. I am heading down in three weeks for my 14th visit because the major attractions of the island overwhelm the downsides for me.
"Treepug.. I have a brother in law from New Zealand.. when the family came to Barbados a few years ago, it was amazing how covered from head to toe he got with bits.. sand flies?? Mosquitoes?? whatever.. and it almost didn't matter what he used.. it just happened.. I took him to a pharmacy and had the pharmacist look at it.. He did an anti itch medication all over treatment and was covered up most of the day and night. (besides the fact that he looked terrible.. it was better for him.. ).. but it doesn't happen to everyoneRe the water.. I was soo incensed by the CDC Website last night (christmas eve..) that I sent a message to the CDC and asked them where they get their information or do they simply think that every small island developing state has a water issue.. I drink bottle water.. but only because I'm out(and have forgotten my water bottle) and need something to drink at the store and would rather have that then a softdrink... so I asked them to come.. have it test and try it.. Better than some of the water surrounding Atlanta GA where they are located.."
The water in Barbados is definitely better than the water here in ATL.
"Water in Barbados filters through coral and limestone....it,lol do for me!!!"
JG see LMR's post - she is obviously completely aware of ChikV- and is headed back to the island tomorrow! tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g147262-i230-k80…
"Sunnieb, Tourism is big bucks for Barbados and certainly goes into millions of dollars, just look at the number of restaurants and bars. (is it Sandals that are spending 64 million on their new resort?)There are about 500,000 land based visitors per anum plus around 580,000 cruise ship visitors. If they all spent just £1 each thats over 3million bajan dollars.businessbarbados.com/industries/…file:///C:/Users/User/Downloads/barbados2014.pdfI think a leaflet at the airport giving advice about dengue and chick-v would be a good thing, tuck it into a passport an arrival while doing the passport thing. It's up to individuals what they do with that info but at least they will be aware.Surely the minimal outlay of this would prevent some cases of dengue or chick-v and cut down costs incurred by health organisations on the island. Prevention is better than cure !As for mass panic, I don't think I have ever suggested anything of the sort, just some sensibly worded advice so people can take care and enjoy their holiday."
"The problem with too much advertising is that if one gives a warning to the public, then it can be interpreted very literally: One sees the word ""warning"" or ""health"", ""caution"", and the situation can snowball out of control; the final consensus could be that Barbados is a dangerous place to visit, health wise, which I don't think it is, anymore than the northerncountries in winter. This issue really has to be handled with sensitivity; if tourists are unduly scared off, the economic ramifications for the people here could be devestating."
JFDerYak people could just read their countries travel advice which is kept up to date and is easily changeable unlike a leaflet which once printed cannot be altered and then if advice changes will be redundant. People should also check with their doctor before travel regarding vaccinations being up to date and I am sure it would also flag up at that point too. It is no different to the precautions that people should have been taking to avoid dengue for many years. I think we all now understand that you feel that there should be a leaflet etc etc etc...maybe it is time to move on....

"Are you intending to keep this up all Winter JGD ? Anyone would think you had contracted Chikengunya, and I don't believe you did .?"
"Further more, I think you have just been rather rude to one of our valued Destination Experts who posted an extremely sensible reply to you. That was not necessary. You are becoming obsessive IMO"
tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g147262-i230-k80…This thread reports the Govt advisory - and that leaflets are being given to the hotel etc to put in guests' rooms
"JGD.. our government is broke. those lovely numbers you so kindly posted above don't equal what is needed to keep this country running..solely based on tourism dollars.. tax payers (me and my fellow Barbadians) will end up paying for those leaflets that are handed to you at the airport.. and promptly thrown in the bin at the first opportunity.. Instead of leaflets how about electronic notification, social media, message board, posters, signs and word of mouth could be used at a far less cost.. it's starts with educated travel professionals when you book your holiday and information via the online booking sites as well.. Maybe something the airlines can do when you print your boarding pass..(too late for the information to get to you, if you have any thought of not going because of it.) But once here.. as I said before.. the hotels, the villa's etc, should and could provide the much needed conversation with the visitors.. There are meet and greet personnel at the airport.. there are hotel check in desks.. etc..  As a traveler myself, it is ultimately MY responsibility to read and digest what is out there. and so it should be for every traveler.. Want more info.. this thing has been out there since 1952.. www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs327/en/ it's in the US.. but mostly from people getting it from somewhere else.. but.. there are a few locally contracted cases in Florida.. Common sense must prevail in all of this...."
Totally agree with you Sunnie...I have travelled all over the world and on each adventure I did my due diligence in finding the necessary info about each destination that we were taking. The Chickv issue is not limited to Barbados it is everywhere and with minimal precaution it is controlled...I think we have exhausted this threat to the point where some readers are now overreacting... enough already.
"Sunnie,The total contribution of Travel & Tourism to GDP was BBD3,395.3mn (36.2% of GDP) in 2013,and is forecast to rise by 1.9% in 2014, and to rise by 3.3% pa to BBD4,770.2mn (37.9% of GDP) in 2024I'm sorry that you find nearly 3,500,000,000 tourist (bajan) dollars not enough as a contribution towards your economy. Having read the countries financials perhaps you would be better off saying nothing about chick-v at all and I now understand why you locals get so defensive about it. If Barbados takes too hard a stance on it they will lose trade to another island perhaps.As you say previous poster we are all masters of our own destinies so lets just leave it to rest and say that as a tourist make sure you do your homework before you travel.I'm done (you will all be pleased to know lol)Edited: 5 years ago "
"I'm soo happy that you have taken the time to concern yourself with our countries financial reports.. Obviously I haven't.. (except that I live it every day..)Back to the story at hand.. we haven't swept it under the carpet.. just because you think so, doesn't make it sooo.. How many times does someone have to say.. Our Government is trying to get rid of the problem .. the Mosquitoes.. They have put up notifications.. people are being told.. it's only become an issue on this side of the world recently.. and it effects ALL Caribbean Islands.. at least we are trying to do something about it..and yes.. Dear Tourist.. Do your home work.. Learn about the island you are going to.. don't assume it will be like home, because it isn't. Read what you can.. the info is there..Enough already.."

I thought you were done JGDerYak.
"JGDerYak, that was an interesting but disturbing article; I had no idea Barbados was an offshore tax haven."
"""You know"". No he doesn't know. A thing. Barbados is not an offshore tax haven. The existence of Canadian banks is evidence of a fair and transparent banking system. In fact, you know, Canadian banks have been pulling back from their Carribbean operations due to the poor economy. Hardly an indication of a lucrative tax haven. Seriously?!!!"
"JGIf you are that worried about catching it, don't go. Stop quoting figures at us and insulting residents by inferring they are 'covering it up so that tourists will keep visiting'. Stay at home in Surrey, where you might catch a bad case of the flu, similar symptoms I believe to ChikV. No more please, you are getting boring now!"
"In relation to JGDerYak, really thought in the season of so called good will, he would be allowed to give his comments without receiving such hostility in return.Personally, I found some of his facts and figures of interest and question whether his various posts needed deletion in a forum that should promote healthy debate.Kind regards."
"Jill L----I am at present in bed with flu in Surrey, and I can assure everyone I feel 100 times worse than I did when I got Chik v AND it's well below freezing here! Roll on January when I can go back home to the sun."
"Healthy debate yes, but JG has been given good advice from locals and tourists just back from Barbados.My relative, a Bajan who retired back home and has been there for 17 years now, has got ChikV. She went to her doctor to get it confirmed, has been given anti-inflammatories and apart from having aching joints is able to carry on! And she is not a spring chicken either! So you see, no great drama?!As for receiving hostility on here, please, people are just defending their homeland. I am sure you would do that too, John F? We are just trying to get our point across, and perhaps to some people that comes across as hostile, if read that way. It is difficult to gauge someone's tone when not actually speaking with them.If JG doesn't want to risk it, a very small risk, then he should stay at home, end of. There are plenty of other places he could travel to, but when he starts researching them he will find things he is not happy with, no place on earth is perfect.We will be out there in April/ May for the cricket, can't say we are bothered, I will just use more repellant than I usually do!"
"Surely this 'debate' is going off course.....instead of just factual, helpful advice on common sense precautions it has turned into a 400 + ramble. The government is fogging and giving out advice......regular commentators on here are saying protect yourselves with DEET. We don't need financial facts and figures and arguments.Doubtless someone will follow up arguing 'freedom of speech' or healthy debate.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Apologies Jill L. For any replication,..you have stated far mor eloquently than me, what I was struggling to say at the same time !!"
"@suzieQ, I am done talking about Chick-V@treepug, Oh yes it is @johnF , Thank you@JillL, thank you for your concerns over my health"

"Oooh a new name lol Thanks Jill . I really do feel YUK . Loads of people have got It so I expect I picked it up in the good old Supermarket  My Chik v never stopped me doing anything except stairs and going on the jet ski for a short time. . Mind you, at least it's warm in bed ."
"Crikey, this thread refuses to die. To add my two-penn'orth; I've followed what has been said on here and have researched other sources. I had planned to visit Barbados in March for 3 weeks. On balance, and based on the evidence laid before me so far, my personal decision is, given the choice between the UK where it definitely will be cold, miserable and depressing, and visiting a tropical island for 3 weeks where I might bet bitten by a mozzie, which might make me a bit ill, it's a no brainer. See you guys in March :-)"
"Just to clarify and not intentionally prolonging this topic, Chicv can affect people in many different ways, mine has resulted in prolonged joint inflammation and respiratory problems which I am assured will recede given time, In fact in the Nation today the QE hospital has suffered through staff being infected.If anyone is suffering from influenza I doubt they would even be able to sit up and use a computer/I pad."
"I guess the flu can also affect people in different ways. It is usually a couple of days where you don't want to, or can't do anything, after that you should be able to use a laptop or iPad while lying in bed. Happy 2015 to all, and happy hols in beautiful Barbados!"

"I have no idea why some posters have to be so provocative.I know others have asked. but, could we not put this all to rest.We all have mega information on Chic V and can make our own decisions!!Please, please, lets move on. There are so many wonderful things about Barbados we could be talking about........sun, breezes, beautiful waters, wonderful people, great food, heat..............."
Hi thereI have just read your post. Did you go to Barbados? If so what was the situation like? I have tickets booked for Feb but am unsure of what to do.Thanks
Really ? Only advice from the Foreign Office would make me cancel a holiday.
Hello I have just read your post re Barbados. We live in Cornwall and have two young children and a holiday booked to Barbados. I usually throw caution to the wind but I have read some awful facts about chikungunya. As someone that has had it what would you recommend we use if we go. I am less bothered about myself and more about my children. I love sunbathing! Would you recommend keeping them in all in one suits on the beach? Any other advice would be really appreciated. We have been to Barbados twice before and love it but I am scared for my children as they are so young. Thanks
Normally I would too. I have 2 small kids that make me worry!
"Hi Tashertourmaline The virus is slowing right down now, but do read the previous 471 posts for information on everything you could wish to learn about Chikengunya to enable you to make an informed decision. Personally, I cannot wait to get back on that plane and get away from the UK asap. I am in bed suffering from Pneumonia contracted during my visit here, and have 22 days left to make a complete recovery. I caught Chik in early November and was over it in 5 days All you need to do is take the precautions I didn't .Edited: 5 years ago "
"Tashtourmaline, I can quite understand your anxiety regarding your children, it would be awful for them , or indeed yourself to contact it. Nobody wants to waste well earned holidays being ill or looking after sick children. I have had Chicv and it is not nice, however I am booked to return to Barbados this year so it hasn't put me off returning. I would speak to your pharmacist or GP regarding suitable spray for the children and make sure you use it on them and yourself - chances are you will be fine and have a wonderful holiday.My friend has just returned and recommends mosquito nets for over the beds/cots."
"I'm not even going to respond, because I'll likely get thrown off the page..."
"www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs327/en/Chikungunya has been identified in nearly 40 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and also in the Americas.What are people going to do when it moves to Canada and the US? It is only a matter of time. We will use bug spray and try and take precautions as we will do on holidays.If it made it's way to Barbados it will make it's way to another place. It is already on other Islands as well so I guess the only option is don't go on holidays and stay home and hope it never comes to the Country you live in. Other option is use bug spray and hope it works. I can understand worrying when you have young children but we need to use common sense."
Tashatourmaline. There are almost 500 posts about this subject in this thread and many more in other threads. What more information do you need?
"I understand people are frightened of catching Chikungunya and I took more precautions than ever before on our trip in December but dengue has been about for years which can be life threatening, and people never seemed as concerned about that as they appear to be about chikungunya . I think perspective is the key. If you take precautions and use deet repellent I am sure you will all be safe. Also please don't worry unduly I think people are probably spoiling the excitement of their holidays by getting the threat out of proportion.That article is interesting Gem and I agree with your observations."
"Hi, I caught Chikungunya in Barbados at the end of October, while staying in the Rockley resort near St Lawrence Gap. I had the diagnosis confirmed on my return to the UK. There was at least one person in the immediate area with Chikungunya, but I think the epidemic is being kept under wraps as much as possible. I am still very ill and in a lot of pain over 3 months later. Anyone visiting the Caribean should keep mosquito repellant on during the day as that's when they bite you."
"Sorry to hear of your illness. Fortunately it appears to have abated quite a bit, likely due to the end of rainy season."
"Sue M, I'm sorry that you have this and are experiencing the after effects.. Trust me.. there are friends of mine who wake up every morning wondering which joint or ache or pain will they be inflicted with that day. Not sure what you are doing about this, however, and I'm not a medical doctor, however.. one of the issues with this virus is that attaches the joints and previous conditions. Friends have taken anti-inflammatory medicines that have help greatly with the pain. but these are things that your doctor needs to talk to you about. As someone living here, It is not under wraps.. the information is still out there and to my knowledge the government is still fogging and checking potential sites for mosquito breeding (someone just the other day has been charged with having too many open containers of water and mosquito breeding) but I can say there are many less ""cases"" then were reported several months ago."
"I posted a message in mid December 2014 having returned from Barbados with chickV, at the time I complained that I didn't think the local authorities were disclosing it correctly as I saw just one sign in Hometown, nothing at the airport or my accomadation.It seems this virus has a funny way of manifesting itself, I have read that 60-70% of people that contract chickV have no symptoms. It seems the symptoms vary so differently in the individual.My partners symptoms were quite mild, sore Achilles tendons and arthritic fingers. My symptoms were typical, heavy fever for 3 days, followed by intense joint pains for the best part of a week, rash after fever resided.I also read posts from people playing down, saying ""a few days fever and some aches and pains and that it, what's all the fuss about"" NO! NO.. I'm 52 years old and used to train 5 days a week, the reason I was in beautiful barbados was to surf and kite surf. I'ts now two months since I contracted chickV, for the first month I slept 12 hours a night, I had to get down the stairs in the mornings on my behind as my ancles were to sore to walk on. I'm constantly fatigued and mentally it has caused me to question my overal health as I keep asking myself what the hell is wrong with me. This has led to me visiting my doctor to have every test possible to find out what's wrong with me, only to find they are all negative, thats of course apart form chick V. There is a massive psychological effect that contributed to the desease, which is also confirmed by the medical journal.Last night I again tried to play the game I love and have participated in for over 25 years, Squash. It resulted in me smashing my raquet on the floor and walking off court in shear frustration due to the fact that my joints hurt so much that I couldn't change direction.Chick V has ruined my life, and I don't know for how much longer as medically there's not enough information to confirm this. I'm sorry, but I'm really peeved off and want my life back..."
"Hi, I stayed in 2 apartments in Rockley and the 2nd one in particular was infested with mosquitoes. We bought all sort of things to deter them and put loads of repellant on. What I needed to know, which would have prevented me from catching this awful disease was that these mosquitoes bite during the day. It is not very helpful for people to say they didn't suffer very much from Chikungunya or that it attacks people predisposed to arthritis etc. I also had blood tests for arthritis and they were negative. I'm normally a very a active person, but this has left me unable to do hardly anything. Even carrying shopping bags causes pain a day or 2 later. Also it was 3-4 weeks after infection when I started to get pain. I had none with the initial infection. I only visited Barbados in October, but saw no information on Chikungunya by travel agents, airlines or resort management. If you research Chikungunya you can find info on it, but it is not provided to you. ThanksSue"
"I just need to say.. please do not blame Barbados for this Virus that has attached your body.. it's in more places than Barbados and while you may view it as the authorities not doing what they could to warn people.. 250,000 plus people live on the island.. and not everyone has contracted it. if I sound pissed it is because many of the posts are making, maybe with out be pointed, it sound as if it's the fault fault of the island.. and it's not.I have had a virus since January.. flu/cold whatever.. Up to this morning I still have not had my voice back to me properly in 4 weeks. (and as I work in sales.. this isn't doing me any favours) Until I forced myself to return to an exercise class last week, I have felt like crawling into bed every day after work and staying there till I had to go to work.. It's not Chik-V.. but an airbourne virus I got from others.. brought to the island?? lives here?? who knows.. it's winter and it happens (maybe not to me) ever year.. and it happens all over the world.. to Phillip P.. it has been shown to also attach preexisting conditions.. as an athlete.. or someone who participates in serious activity (ie surfing, squash).. you may be feeling in the parts of your body that take on the most stress through those activities. Again.. NOT A DOCTOR.... but please talk to your doctor about what you are feeling.. treat the symptoms. I have friends and relatives who do this on a daily basis.. taking Anti-inflammatory medicines they wouldn't normally take just to get rid of the pain. Unfortunately for some this can go on for up to 18 months (or so it is said).."
I had read about this virus back in April of last year being on another Island. How it had found its way to one and it was a matter of time before it would reach the others. Like in previous post a person travelling did some research on what is out there they could decide if they should book or not. Is it being advertised in DR? I'm sure it's a lot worse there then in Barbados. Unfortunately the after effects of Chick are not nice for some. Each person reacts different same as with the common cold. I also have a friend that lives on the Island that is very active and he has been suffering with it for a few months now. It's like everything else in life it's a chance you take. I have at least 8-10 bites which I assume are mosquito bites. If I get Chick then it's something I will deal with. I was well aware of this long before I booked my return trip. I also know there are many other things that can put me out of commission for short or long periods of time. It's call life and how the environment is changing. It's not Barbados responsibility it's the travellers responsibility to be well informed. How do you think the locals feel having to live with the chance of getting it? They didn't ask for it to be on the Island. Did you know it is in 40 different countries? Maybe yours is next.
"I'm sorry, but did I blame Barbados? I provided a factual account of what happened to me while on holiday there and vocalised my concern about the lack of information - this is targeted at the people who provide holidays, health organisations, governments etc, not the people who live in Barbados. The Caribbean as a whole has been affected, but action taken by the Government of individual islands has varied. I will be returning to Barbados, but I will ensure I go to a resort which takes action to minimise the number of mosquitoes living and breeding there."
"Sue M -honestly (we are not Bajan's just Can.""snowbirds ""who winter here) -don't know what more the Govt can do - they have published info on the subject - put up banners - provided handout to hotels etc..... they are running a major fogging program....they have health inspectors checking private properties etc on carelessness with regard to standing water..... Individual property owners have been fogging too (our complex now fogs 3 times a week instead of just once a week) - ...even posters on TA have been begging visitors to use repellent spray 24/7 as the chikv mossie bites during the daytime unlike the reg. mossies that bite dusk to dawn - and to spray their homes and rooms with insecticide as the chikv mossie lives indoors too - so not sure what else can be done to warn or protect visitors ?- it certainly is NOT through lack of trying to get the message out - newspapers and TV have carried reports in other countries on this problem too - so apart from the lack of info being passed out by travel agents or airlines ( and one knows why they don;t do it - as it might damage their trade) .... what else can be done...?? - Do hope you will feel better soon!Edited: 5 years ago "
"Sue M I am very sorry you have contracted this disease. That being said I must ask.... before your trip did you consult the UK travel medicine site https:/… the CDC or Health Canada sites? Chick has been on this island since last spring and has been discussed on this forum since Sept. To my knowledge the three sites mentioned have offered advice regarding the disease since the summer as well. Did your travel agent tell you what vaccinations you needed to keep up to date? did they discuss dengue, a much more serious disease that has been throughout the Caribbean for decades? Personally I would never rely on a travel agent or airline (or anyone who stands to make money from my travel) to advise me of local health concerns (or even safety concerns). I know working people don't have a lot of time to research travel plans but IMO people must take responsibility for their health (and safety).Please don't feel that you are under attack, that is not my intention.I hope your physician can come up with a treatment plan to reduce your pain and increase your mobility."
"Sue, Very sorry to hear of your illness. Which 2 apartments in Rockley did you stay at ? We just returned from 4 weeks in Rockley and didn't see any ""fogging""-either by the government or by our apartment owner. Having said that, in the 4 weeks we didn't see a single mozzie or get any bites, even though it was quite wet the first week of our stay. We did use tropical strength deet on arms and legs day and night just to be sure.We did see a notice about the virus posted up on the door of the Massy supermarket, but had read about it on this forum anyway before our trip."
"I ma due to go to Barbados in April, is the disease dying down now due to time of year? do i still need to take precaiutions re spraying deet during the day ontop of suntan lotion?"
It has definitely calmed down a bit but yes still take precautions.
"Don`t forget at night too on all exposed parts.We took some Deet wipes,which were very effective."
"Yes at night too for comfort - but the aedes aegypti mosquitoes that carry dengue and ChikV - ""feed""/bite during the daytime - so allowing for the day to night and night to day change- make sure you are sprayed with repellent - at dawn and at dusk too - have a great holiday"
"I agree, spray morning, day, evening and wash off before going to bed. Rent accommodations that have screened windows and use fans (or AC), the mosquitoes do not like moving air. If you have open doors during the day (we don't and we ask the maid to keep it closed when cleaning) then spray your place when closing up or burn a mosquito coil. We have been here since Feb. 1st and have seen *very* few mosquitoes(brown) and no aegypti (black with white dots). We have a few bites but I think they are more likely no-see-um bites rather than mosquito bites. That doesn't mean there are *no* mosquitoes, it would be foolish not to take precautions. Don't fret over it just use your head and enjoy your vacation."
"We were in Hastings from 7 until 14 Feb and didn't any mossies. We followed the advice of putting on sun tan lotion in the morning, letting it dry then spraying with deet. We sprayed before going out in the evening, used a plug in device and Incognito soap and shampoo/shower gel and didn't get bitten by anything. I frequently get bitten in Europe and even at home in the UK in the garden.We were worried before we went and as it hit the press in the UK about 10 days before we were due to pay the balance on the holiday, we seriously thought about not going. I am so glad we didn't cancel as we had a brilliant time."
"I've been at Rockley for 2 months and have only seen one or two ""mossies"". I've used a ""Vape"" plug-in, spray the bedroom at night and use a repellent when walking in grassy areas or areas with trees and bushes, especially at night. We've also left the ceiling fans running 7/24. Rockley has certainly cut back the greenery, bushes etc and are spraying them and fogging on a regular basis. It seems to be working, although I have to admit that having stayed here for the past 5 years, I've not encountered many flying insects at all in the past."
"NorthCanuck, our house has no screens - opening the vented windows always creates a breeze. We do use vapes, sprays, etc, and the bedrooms have AC. I've never been close enough to distinguish skeeter ""markings,"" but if I do, I'll let you know. And I do realize that it's only the females who suck blood, and only then to nourish their young, and that the various viruses aren't their fault, Accordingly, I smash them whenever I see them."
I smash them too! lol Sorry if that offends animals lovers. Normally I don't bother to differentiate between species but this year is slightly different. We found one brown one on the inside of the screened window and one brown one in our lettuce (as we washed it). That's how I can say no aegypti seen yet!The mosquito can only pass on the virus during the first 7 days of host infection. Eventually a form of herd immunity should exist and the prevalence of chik will decrease much like dengue. If the number of people with active chik (first 7 days) is reduced ( the host becomes immune after first infection) so is the spread. IMO Barbados has done well in controlling the mosquitoes and in reducing the spread of chik and as a bonus the presence of dengue should have been reduced as well since it is the same mosquito species that spreads it. Hopefully a vaccine will be developed to control the spread of both dengue and chik... as long as people get vaccinated!
Today is the 6 month anniversary of this post. The OP posted a similar message on 3 Carribean forums on the same day. Despite 500 posts he had posted nothing since..... except he visited Barbados in January. His only review was on the Graeme Hall Nature Sanctury ( which he loved) but probably one of the worst places for mosquitos on the Island. Chickungunya was something which needed to to be raised however this thread started some real arguments. It's a shame Colin didn't have the courtesy of coming back and acknowledging the pages of advice and giving us the benefit of his experience when he visited earlier this year..The subject should be kept to the fore and people should continue to take precautions. However no one can read through 500 posts so hopefully this thread can finally be left to die!
I doubt it will die damasust because people find it easier to ask a question than do a search. At least the hysteria has gone....
"I spent two months in a villa on the West Coast (Fitts Village - Dec 2014 and January 2015). Admittedly that's the dry seasonbut the mozzie situation wasn't bad - better than the same months in previous years due to Goverment spraying program, I suspect. I was extra careful with mosquito repellent (used wipes on ankles and elbows after morning shower, and sprayed carefully before sunset). I didn't have one bite the whole time. I suspect Dengue and Chick will flare up again when the rains start in July/August, and the mozzies start breeding again, but I think common sense precautions will keep visitors safe. I also spray my bedroom afew hours before going to bed, by the way and keep those doors and windows closed after spraying. Lots of people I spoke to by the pool had never heard of Dengue or Chick and were taking no precautions (which I thought was mad). Barbados is almost the last place in the Caribbean to get these nasty inflictions - they are on all the other islands as well..Edited: 5 years ago "
"thanks for the advice everyone, I am staying at Waves hotel on the west coast so will ask maid to keep doors closed when cleaning. Where do i get Incognito soap and shower gel? not heard of it.will take the advice of letting suncream dry then spraying with deet before going out during the day and then at dusk."
I got the Incognito products from Holland and Barrett - From memory I got the soap and moisturiser in the local shop and the shampoo on line (from H and B) which arrived promptly. The products have a citronella smell and I shall use them again. Ironically I have been bitten by something in the garden at home this week!
"thanks, i managed to purchase some from amazon and they have arrived so will be taking them with me.thanks for everyone's advice and I will post on when I return to let everyone know how things are"
I don't know of any Hotel that allows the Maids to Keep doors and Windows closed while cleaning.
Beantonka - our maids at PBC keeps the door either closed (if it is very very windy) - or ajar - when cleaning (not the patio/balcony doors - but the door the wind blows through - otherwise she would never be able to leave the floor absolutely clean
We are in a villa not a hotel room so it is not an issue. We simply asked and she smiled and said 'allright'. Why would a hotel insist on a maid opening windows while cleaning?

"Here we go again! A one off post by someone who apparently has not visited Barbados. 1) You cant get Lymes disease from the mosquito in question (comes from ticks)2) It cant be spread, person to person so you cant 'bring it home'3) The mosquitos which cause the infection are already in Canada.4) Cases in the last few months are negligible."
"Damasust, unfortunately I can not read the post before yours as TA has decided to delete it. If in your #3 you are saying the mosquito that can transfer chik (and dengue) is in Canada, to my knowledge that is incorrect. It/they are in the southern US though. If in #2 you are saying that chik or dengue can't be spread person to person it can but only by the two mosquito species that can carry it.It's too bad TA deletes posts... it makes it very difficult to follow the conversation."
"NC - the mossie that damasust is referring to I think is the one that is on Labrador or Nfdland - and it is not the aedes aegypti - but another one whose name I have forgotten - something alike ""albo..."".? it was mentioned some time back as being a *potential* carrier at some stage - in other words it *could* carry the virus - unlike the anopheles which can't ....as for the delete post it was weird - said something about going blind (heard that about other things too! LOL!!!) - as well as the Lyme ""tick"" stuff..... - just as well it was deleted :)"
NC to be honest I think it was a troll.It didn't make sense.Noted re type of Mozzie. I think I picked that up somewhere among the other 500+ comments on this laborious thread. I wish TA would close it down it is by now far to difficult to make any sense of and is a magnet for mad comments!
"From the Public Health Agency of Canada:""The mosquito species known to transmit chikungunya—Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus—are not known to reside in Canada at this time...Recent studies suggest that the climate in most of Canada (except for southern coastal British Columbia and some locations in south central and southeastern Canada) is not suitable for long-term survival of the Aedes albopictus mosquito. There are rare reports of this mosquito in Canada, but there is no evidence that it has become established in any part of Canada."""
"Ahhh, after a little research it is the Aedes Japonicus species that is in NL and is capable of transmitting the virus. Thanks for that ASO and Damasust... one can even learn as a result of a rogue post that has been deleted! hahaEdited: 5 years ago "
"Aedes: A. albopictus - aka the Asian Tiger mosquito - apparently adapts well to many environments, even snow; established, or at least found, in Switzerland and Germany. Weak flyer, so dispersal is mostly as a hitchhiker to shipped goods. Also carries yellow fever. On its own it is invasive, pushing out other mosquito breeds, but fairly easy to control. Responsible for chik outbreaks in Italy.Take notes, there will be a test at the end of the week."
Will it be a True or False - or can we have a 'crib'/(cheat sheet) for assistance? lol
"""found"" <> established"
"NC,The post by the troll roughly said that someone lost their eyes and legs to chik, load of rubbish of course."
Blindness and paralysis can be a complication in children ( www.patient.co.uk/doctor/chikungunya-fever ) but whether the post was true or not who knows.

"Thanks to most of the contributors to this topic. The incidence of the disease has dropped from 1,800 cases in Barbados last year to 80 so far this year[1], mainly due to 'hurd' immunity. Are visitors, who are not immune through previous infection, just as vulnerable? Should they continue to take special precautions? Advice from a Public Health expert would be appreciated.[1] source: CDC stats"
"Good news in respect of Chik V.Not so good news regarding the Zika virus now apparently already in Barbados which is now among the 23 countries the CDC have advised travelling to, if pregnant..Regards."
tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g147262-i230-k91…
"This disease shouldn't be underestimated and symptoms vary from person to person. I had Chik V very badly and 15months on am only just recovering. Prior to the infection when I was in Barbados I was very fit and healthy! Alongside the initial fever, rash etc I had terrible eye pain and couldn't stand an light at all. As I recovered from the fever, I had terrific join pain which went on for a year. I can understand someone saying a person went blind and lost the use of their legs. Pleased the cases are getting less though."
Very worrying as the British Government are now also issuing warnings regarding the horrible Zika virus
Zika is apparently very mild in comparison and I believe I have already had it as was covered in a rash last Monday - felt a bit poorly the prior Sunday but was fine Tuesday. The main concern for for unborn babies.Re ChikV - it's horrid I got it in October 2014 and am just about back to normal - it's incredibly debilitating.
"I have read the travel advice, I'm not worried about me or my husband getting the virus but for any lady who is pregnant or becomes pregnant within a few week of contracting this horrible virus the results could be very very serious indeed."
