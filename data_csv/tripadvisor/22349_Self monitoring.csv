UK has been added to ongoing transmission list saying that travellers need to report symptoms into the reporting system. Has anyone had experience of this? I’m due to travel in two weeks so wondering what to expect when arrive at airport and what is required to report symptoms
It only just started today I believe so we will no doubt get some reports soon. I believe you use an App. To report.
"Hi jessica, I’m flying in 11 days and would also like some clarity on this . I also find it interesting that it has not been mass reported , so I’d keep an eye on the facts."
"We are scheduled to fly back to BKK from CDG and I'm also wondering about how this will work-obviously it was announced before the details have been thought through. (No surprise there!)The real problem will be when the UK and other European destinations graduate to Disease Infected Zone status as they surely will. I'm thinking of routing back from Spain through VIE rather than CDG to avoid what shapes to be a major logistical and administrative disaster.Edited: 8:48 am, March 14, 2020 "
"Self monitoring is one thing, but the UK is likely (just my opinion) to be classed as a ""Disease Infected Zone"", in which case you have to be quarantined.Once 1000+ cases are in the UK, for 14 consecutive days, we're classed as a Disease Infected Zone, making it pointless to travel to Thailand for a holiday.We were at almost 800 yesterday....We're sure to fly early April, but I just don't see that being possible with mandatory isolation being in place."
"Indeed. The question becomes how those who have to transit Bangkok to get home without being whisked into detention!Patrick to do you (or anyone else) have a link to show the definition of Disease Infected Zones?Edited: 10:04 am, March 14, 2020 "
"Page 3 of this PDF has the definition:https:/…q_a_travelers110363.pdfhttps://ddc.moph.go.th/viralpneumonia/eng/ is a good website to be monitoring, as well as:https:/…"
"I'm presuming this won't apply to travllers in transit? I might have to go straight through from CDG to MEL with a 2hr break in BKK, rather than overnighting in BKK as I usually do."
"You'd think not, if it's just a transit without a visa to enter the country. Can't find anything to say for sure though."
Yes I agree that we will be listed as disease infected. I’ve been watching Malta on the FCO website who have just imposed a 14 day quarantine and they are now advising against all but essential travel. So I hope this would also happen for Thailand if we do get listed as disease infected and allow for me to get a refund/postpone my trip.
"Good spot with Malta - yes, you'd think the same thing will happen with Thailand then."
This is also a useful site: https:/…countries
Just adding to this thread...they mention taking your own temperature twice a day and reporting it. I presume you can buy thermometers there. I have tried all options (Amazon/Argos/chemists) in London and cannot find one. Are there shortages there?
"I’ve seen I another thread that they are 250bht so guessing you can buy them there. Have you tried some online baby shops, maybe independent ones as they may have some still available"
My family and I are due to fly to Phuket on 5th April. I'm petrified that when we land one of us will fail the screening and be forced to self isolate for the entirety of our holiday. I'd cancel however having checked my insurance i'm only covered following a travel ban which hasn't yet been imposed. I'm really at a loss
@ Vanessa there are plenty of thermometers available on eBay.
Tbh that’s the main concern I have Kirstie .. we are due to fly 1st April. Not worries about going. It’s the self monitoring and what would happen should one of us have a temperature.
"Travel ban could happen if we are added to the ""Infected Zones"" list which seems probable now by end of March. There is a possibility that the UK will lockdown, so no one will be flying anywhere if that happens.Self monitoring is just advising your temperature. Yes if you have a temperature, no doubt you will have to have test and be quarantined."
I’m due to fly 26 March and have exactly same concerns. I work from home normally and have a tendency to catch anything when I have to go into the office and be close to lots of people. worried about catching something in the airport and then being put in quarantine. I can cancel but lose all my money or just hope the FCO take things out of my hands and advise against all travel. It is changing so quickly.On a plus what I have seen about the self monitoring process doesn’t seem too bad it’s just what happens if I get nay kind of symptoms
"Incubation time is surely more than travel time. Would think any fever would show up days after arrival. Though leaving could be an issue.Edited: 7:56 am, March 16, 2020 "
I don’t get how they are going to be able to check. Do you have to be witnessed by a nominated person? Twice a day? ...
It doesn't look like we'll be going anyway :( Gutted!
"I am gutted and relieved at the same time. Just got to sort things out, get money back and plan it all over again"
Our flights have been cancelled!
