Hi. Our Airbnb is on Moonstone Beach drive. We are driving from LA on the 101. We would like to purchase meats and grocery before checking in. Where can we find a Ralph’s or von’s or Costco before Cambria ? Which exit is best to get gas/grocery? Thanks
How far ahead? There is an Albertson's at Morro Bay.
Costco from the south is on Los Osos Valley Road in San Luis Obispo.You should not be doing this during pandemic times.
"No big chain store in Cambria thank goodness. You can stop at the places mentioned before you get there or support the local economy and go to the Cookie Crock. It’s Cambria’s supermarket and they will have everything you need. It’s just above Main Street in West Village on Knollwood. When I travel I like to shop stores I wouldn’t normally to get the real feel of the place I’m visiting. https://www.cookiecrock.com/You can get gas at the Shell Station on Main Street too. If you need an extra sweatshirt it’s the place to go too or a Cambria shot glass. No need to take extra exits before getting to Cambria.Edited: 10:16 pm, August 02, 2020 "
"We made the best BBQ hamburgers from the market in Cambria. There's a Farmers Market on Friday,or there was prior to SARS-COV-2.And Linn's has their great pies and other specialties. Make it local! Save Costco for concreteville.Edited: 11:43 pm, August 02, 2020 "
Farmers Market has resumed on Fridays 2:30-5pm. Cookie Crock is small and more expensive than some of the larger supermarkets in Morro Bay (Albertsons) or Los Osos (Ralphs). There's also a small store in Cambria's East Village - Sotos True Earth Market ' that is focused on high quality produce and meats. Across the street from them you can get ollalieberry pie and other desserts at Linns. Please be diligent with distancing and wearing a mask. Our COVID numbers have been going up steadily since the influx of summer visitors.
"The Shell Station on Main Street for gas, be sure to go in the store and look around for souvenirs. My little granddaughter loved shopping in there. Bring a face covering and social distance. Have fun! :)"
Those of us who live in Cambria fill up with gas in Morro Bay. It can be as much as a dollar less a gallon there. There are three gas stations as soon as you get off Hwy 1 at Morro Bay Blvd.
