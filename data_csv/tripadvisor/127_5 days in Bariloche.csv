"I will be going to Bariloche for the first time the last week of november and I need help planning my itinerary. I will be there for 5 full days. I want to do some hiking, biking, if possible. What do you recommend? I was thinking 1 day trip to El Bolson, 1 day trip to SAn Martin de los Andes. Should i spend the night in San MArtin de los Andes? Do you recommend Villa La Angostura? What other things do you recommend me to do during the 5 days in Bariloche?"
"We only spent 3 days there, but really recommend all of the below as a starter- Nazi walking tour- Dinner at Alto el Fuego (best meat we had in all of Argentina)- All the Cervezerias both in the city and in the hills, like Berlina/Patagonia- Hike to Refugio Frey"
"Hey,There is some really good hiking around the area, really depends if you want to do day or multi day hikes and your abilities.As mentioned Refugio Frey is a nice one day hike.There is also a multi day hut to hut hike which is good but more demanding.You could also go to Pampa Linda and hike from there around Tronador, there are several routes including a popular one called Paso de las Nubes(most people take 2days) and another more demanding longer hike that ends in Colonia Suiza.If you just want to do one day hikes then there is alot of options in Bariloche/San Martin de dos Andes area.You should be able to find all the information at Club Andino in Bariloche.Happy hiking!"
"Hi,We were lucky enough to have 5 days in Bariloche earlier this year.We are a big hikers, so we can recommend the following:Day 1 - Refugio Frey day hikeDay 2 - Cerro Campanario & Cerro Llao Llao day hikesDay 3 - Cerro Tronador Multi Day Hike Day 1Day 4 - Cerro Tronador Multi Day Hike Day 2Day 5 - city exploring - great chocolate stores & barsLet's hope the pandemic finishes soon, so you can go on that trip.Cheers, Dan & Beck, Travel Made Me Do It"
Let's hope for all this COVID-19 to pass soon! Cheers.
