"Hello, with this post I would like to ask you Sri Lankan experienced people: How do you write a Sri Lankan address? Sri Lanka has two official languages: Sinhala and Tamil. But the addresses always seem to be written in English. What is the usual spelling? Can the taxi driver read an English address and take me to my hotel (museum, sights, ...)? Background of my question: In China I had to find out that only the taxi drivers at the airport speak (a little bit) English. When starting from the hotel, one has to ask the hotel clerk to note down the address in Chinese. And don't forget the (Chinese) name card of the hotel ;-)So... How's the situation in Sri Lanka?Greetings,Liese"
Sri Lanka has 3 languages. So everybody speak English and the most can read English. No worry.
"Yes and don't emphasize the postal code too much. It does exist, generally indicating a quarter/area within a town (nearest post office), but most locals hardly use it. Just make sure you write the FULL adtess, which could e.g. be for Sandya's birth adress 5 levels* House number, sometimes even a name* Hamlet (often part of a longer road; could also e.g. be '5th mile post' (interesting in a country that for the llast 70 years does not use miles but km, but traditions fof adresses are hard to change)* Area/zone* Main village for that zone* Main city, in her case Kandy< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"Most people can speak a few words of English but note that most cannot read English, especially outside Colombo and main tourist areas.Also keep in mind that Sri Lankans, when asked for directions or about an address, hate to say that they don't know. If they don't know, they will come up with some explanation, most common being ""It is just a couple of miles/kilometers down the road"". It seems that most people think that they look pretty bad if they are asked for direction and they don't know."
"A few corrections to #1:""Sri Lanka has 3 languages."" Only Sinhala and Tamil are official languages. English is a link language, but in practice, English is heavily used due to colonial legacy and because many Sinhalese don't know Tamil and vice-versa. "" So everybody speak English and the most can read English.""This is stretching it. If you take the country as a whole, most people can't speak more than a few words of English. However, urban dwellers (especially in Colombo) and people in the tourist industry know English pretty well. The reading ability in general is a lot better than the speaking ability as English is taught as a subject. But still, don't expect most people, especially older people, to be able to read English in rural areas.Edited: 10:28 am, July 02, 2020 "
"Thank you all for your replies! As scoobyscoobydoo said, ""people in the tourist industry know English pretty well”"", so I assume there is no need to get the Sedamo address for each tourist spot, as I did in China. (Pretty helpful, by the way!)Now, we just have to wait for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and the journey can begin :-DGreetings from Salzburg (Austria)Liese"
"Hi, Don't worry, you can use English without any problem. Most Sri Lankan can read some English. If, for example, you send a letter to Sri Lanka, you also have to write it in english. Just follow this way, if you write an address:NameHouse number and streetVillage (only if it belongs to a city)CityCountry Concerning Covid-19, the situation in Sri Lanka is on the way back to normal. Airports will open for tourists in near future."
"Dear Dasun,Thank you very much for your reply! You wrote:> If, for example, you send a letter> to Sri Lanka, you also have to write> it in english. That really surprises me! I think Sri Lanka is the only country where the postal language is not (one of) the official language(s). > Concerning Covid-19, the situation > in Sri Lanka is on the way back > to normal. Airports will open for > tourists in near future.Sorry, but I cannot agree! ""Back to normal"" would mean that no-one is carrying the virus any more. The situation is ""safe"" would mean that all patients have been separated from the public which is clearly not the case. I am a member of The SOS Card Project which, by the way, warned on 28th of December 2019 via its network. Don't believe the lulling official statements of the governments! The SARS-2 pandemic will not be over until over 2/3 of all people have been vaccinated. Which hopefully will be the case somewhen in 2022..."
