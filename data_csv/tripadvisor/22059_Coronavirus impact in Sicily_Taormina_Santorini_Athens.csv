"Anyone with ""boots on the ground"" that can tell me what's going on in Taormina and Sicily due to the covonavirus? Are the tourist areas in Taormina and others areas such as Agrigento, Piazza Armerina,and Siracuse open? What about restaurants, ferry and other services? I'm also scheduled to visit Santorini and Athens. Flying Delta, KLM, Olympic Air and Aegean Air plus ferry service. If one of these legs falls apart i'm toast! My travel insurance won't cover cancellation....only covers me if i get sick. Any feedback would be helpful and appreciated."
"In Sicily schools are shut, and theatres are closed. HOwever museums and archaeological sites are all open. Basically places where crowds can be or you are in close proximity to someone else are discouraged. Shops, restaurants and bars are all open. This is all in place for a couple of weeks. Nobody knows what will happen after that."
"hi, in greece the virus problem does not exist.in sicily there have been few cases and the situation is under control."
Would it effect the international Taormina Film Fest 2020 from june 28-july4 2020?taorminafilmfest.it

"Schools are closed throughout Italy, not just Sicily.Vagabonda"
Thanks for the responses. Just learned the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asks anyone traveling to countries with widespread or ongoing community spread (Italy currently falls in this category) to self quarantine at home for 14 days once returning home. I've decided to postpone my trip for now.
Yes...https:/…coronavirus-italyThe quarantine factor is a primary consideration.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18789…Vagabonda
"We still plan to keep our plans for Sicily unless things change greatly.The situation in Greece, as elsewhere, changes by the hour.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian…"
"It is low season, and so typically a quiet period, but there are fewer tourists than usual.Weather's been mild....Vagabonda"
"I have been in Sicily since 4th March. In most places we have been the only two tourists in our accomodation. )Palermo/Gangi/Pollina/Etna/Noto/Stromboli.A lot is closed, partly due to the ‘season’ only starting in mid March. On Stromboli at the moment only one restaurant open, we were told this is because of the low season and also the Coronavirus. As far as we know only 4 tourists here and we are the only one in our hotel. So ironically it feels pretty safe in terms of contagion as we see almost nobody. In Milazzo everyone staying 1m apart and wearing gloves but restaurants open. All museums closed. This could change."
"This is a useful thread, thanks. Booked to fly to Taormina for a week on the 19th March. The hotel we booked have contacted us and said they're going to close because of the Corona impact so have offered us alternative accommodation. My biggest fear is not so much getting the virus but that we'll get over there and everywhere will be closed - all the nice coffee shops, restaurants, bars, museums, tourist attractions etc. It's not sounding good from what people are reporting here. I think because of the significant change to our booking (hotel change) it qualifies us to get a full refund. Really torn with what to do, was really looking forward to going for a lovely romantic break but doesn't seem like there's any point if it'll be a ghost town. Any updates to the situation would be greatly appreciated, thanks"
It has changes as all of Italy is now red zone.https://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/coronavirus-…Vagabonda
"Hello Vagabonda and others. My understanding is that the speech by Prime Minister Conte extending the restriction of travel to all of Italy is directed to the citizens of Italy. It is unclear to me how this will relate to short-term visitors such as tourists who may have several internal destinations, some of which are needed to depart the country.chietitoday.it/cronaca/corona-virus-spostame…If you or others have relevant official information, much appreciated if you would share.We have a visit to Taormina and other destinations in Italy in September so are very interested in the longer term implications of events that are playing out today. Our arrangements were made before the situation blew up in Northern Italy. While we are hopeful that the situation will improve before too long, it appears that we are still on the ascending portion of the curve."
"Hello cicimo,It's impossible to predict for September, but for now....https:/…105955325Vagabonda"
"My dearest Vagabonda,I can read in Italian now, so I have read the announcement in the link you posted and my heart stopped for a moment. My thoughts are with beautiful Sicily and Italy. Of all the people, you know very well how I love La Bella Italia...I hope you and your family are OK. I am thinking about you every day... please stay safe and healthy...With all my love and gratitude,Nora"
Too early to tell. I forecast the whole of Europe will be on lockdown before the end of April with travel severely restricted if allowed at all.UK likely to be on full lockdown by the end of March.
"Very much appreciate your well wishes Nora, and yes, thankfully my family is healthy.Italy has been bold with this necessary lockdown to halt the spread of this virus, and testing is ongoing. Many regions have been more significantly impacted than Sicily.Surprisingly family members have indicated that the lockdown doesn't feel as terrible as expected, and some were involved in the initial red zone lockdown long before the National lockdown.May you also stay safe and healthy.Vagabonda"
"Italy is certainly setting the standards for other countries, not only on what to do in very hard times, but also on how to do it with a positive attitude, style and imagination. I’m sure it’s not easy but we all know if Italy can get through it, we can. Sending all warm thoughts from Ireland, we are grateful!"
"hi, my husband and i also have an extended trip to sicily booked for september 3. i guess it is a wait and see at this point, we also booked our trip way before this began, praying this passes soon, stay safe"
"hi to all, my husband and i also had a trip planned to sicily leaving september 3, everything booked on january 7th,(hubby kind of had no choice but to take an early retirement) so decided that we would take an extended visit to our homeland country. we havent been back in 40 years. my heart is heavy for the world, hard to believe what has happened in such a short time, i realize it is too early to predict what will happen for september....i did have hope that it would turn around now not so sure. i feel that this will change people for awhile, the uncertainty of a second wave? stay safe everyone"
For time being Santorini is locked down. Not even Greeks from mainland or other islands can travel here. No hotels or restaurants are open .

"n consistence with the Italian Government measures and the Sicilian Government statutes, all residents and visitors need to: Limit voyages, except if it is for work reasons, fundamental needs (social insurance and food supplies), wellbeing reasons or to see family members. Regardless to move from a spot to another, you should consistently fill and sign a self-confirmation structure and take it with you. Remain in any event one meter away from others and maintain a strategic distance from swarmed places. The restriction on open and outside get-togethers is still set up Wash your hands regularly Arm yourself with reasonable individual defensive gear (veils, gloves). On the off chance that you have a fever over 37.5 degrees, you are emphatically prescribed to remain at home and cutoff social contacts however much as could be expected. You ought to likewise call your primary care physician. Individuals who have been isolated or have tried positive for COVID-19 are completely denied from leaving their home."
"Keen to hear about the current situation and how it's looking for the coming weeks/months. We would like to travel from the UK end of July to Taormina, Alitalia is flying but not all hotels are taking bookings. What are the chances of us being able to visit and enjoy near normality if that's possible these days?"
Hi Eeva. Did you travel to Taormina? I have just booked to go in September and just wondering if most of the bars and restaurants are open and what the rules are? Are they taking cash or just card payments?
"Thanks BBcanada123, just seeing your post!Hi JonnyK1274, there are several running threads about Taormina currently if you were to search.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18789…But continue to stay abreast of updates and possible changes in regulations as numbers indicate a slight upward tick.VagabondaEdited: 8:17 pm, August 11, 2020 "
Hi Vagabonda. Thank you so much for your reply and forum link. So helpful and very informative!
"All helpful messages here. Does anyone know how restrictive the government is when you arrive in Sicily? We are Canadians, planning to visit at the end of August and I'm concerned that we'll be locked down in our villa the entire time?Does anyone restrict travel outside the villa? Obviously, we've tested ourselves as a group, to ensure we're healthy. And we wear masks as we do here at home.Edited: 1:08 pm, August 12, 2020 "
Prego and best wishes JonnyK1274!Vagabonda
"Canadians are permitted entry, but required to self-isolate and quarantine for 14 days.Vagabonda"
"I would expect that it's the best it's going to be at the moment, and further restrictions will be inevitable, so continue to consult official websites for updated information.Vagabond"
Any updates on the situation in Sicily?For what it's worth my family and I have recently returned from a holiday in the Venice area.No restrictions on travellers from the UK.Masks mandatory in shops (largely enforced firmly but politely) and then became mandatory when moving around bars/restaurants after 6pm the night before we left.IS the situation the same/similar in Sicily?Planning to book Taormina for late September.
"Hi Dave,Just returned yesterday, sound similar to Venice, everyone wearing mask indoors (Apart from restaurants where its just staff).I would say less than 5% of people are wearing them outside after 6pm (even in the crowded areas). This rule really doesn't look to have had an impact.Apart from the Masks you wouldn't notice any difference to a usual Italian holiday tbh."
Thanks Lidds.All booked up now and quite excited.My 5th time but first for over ten years for some bizarre reason...
