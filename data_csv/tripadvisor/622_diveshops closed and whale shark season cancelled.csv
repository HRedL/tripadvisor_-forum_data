Please be sure to advise the sharks.
"They were Q'ing up to leave the Gulf........ Fish & Game doing health checks, so still a bit of a bottleneck"
Will sharks get a refund or a voucher?

"I find it sad that the trolls are taking pleasure in the island closing down, and amusing that they think whalesharks are in the loop about covid19.  I think the best time for whalesharks is May-June, so hopefully they'll reopen by then. Quarantine has me looking at all my old Tao pics, can't wait to go back."
I think June would be really optimistic. Actually September might even be. CV19 hasn't even run its course here yet.
