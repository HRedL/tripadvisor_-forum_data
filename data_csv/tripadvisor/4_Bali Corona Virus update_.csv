Hi my family and I are booked to travel to Bali via Thailand on the 13th of March. I will be travelling with my parents and my young children (1 & 7). I was wondering if it was safe to go to Bali at this time and whether there being zero reported Corona Virus cases was true for Bali?The company that I have booked my villa through have been following up with me for my balance payment and assure me that Bali is safe but it would be great to hear from other travellers that are planning to visit or already there.Thanks in advance.
"Hello Vishal,If you believe the latest statistics being 3 cases in India, 35 cases in Thailand and still none in Bali. You are safer in Bali than anywhere else. I’m in Bali atm and life is as normal here.Edited: 5:35 am, February 18, 2020 "
"Hi Glenn,Thanks for your response. For me it was a bigger concern when I read that Bali/Indonesia has zero cases as the virus has reached parts of Europe as well which is much further away - is it really true? Some say that it’s because they don’t have test kits over there, others say it’s being hidden so it doesn’t hit tourism...I hope you have a safe trip in Bali and do share some updates if you hear anything.Thanks again"
We are also travelling to Bali on the same day via Bangkok and really worried about the situation .
"On a positive note , I havent read of any Australians returning from Bali infected.I think by now we would of heard something.Goodluck"
It is very much a personal decision as to whether to cancel or proceed with travel plans. Perhaps you could consider that statistically there is a much higher percentage of risk of catching various diseases and/or being involved in a nasty traffic accident both in your home city or anywhere else in the world.
"When SARS happened, Indonesia was zero SARS patient and nowadays also zero positive Covid-19 patient.Every year there are 1.4 million people go to Middle East for Umroh, Haj or working there, so Indonesia is always aware of Corona Virus such as MERS. Indonesia is also aware of Bird Flu virus of migrant birds from north and south hemisphere, however Bird Flu virus is different with Corona Virus. So, Indonesia can easily detect the viruses, if any."
Does no reports mean no cases???
There are about 50 Covid-19 suspect patients. Even who get common cold is checked and all of them are negative of Covid-19.
"LeeLou, have a look at the other threads on this subject - there's been much debate about just that. So far, I've not read any details of what kinds of tests are being used, their accuracy and under what criteria they are being applied. The thing that does reassure me is, as LimitedEdition points out, there don't seem to be any people reporting symptoms coming home from Bali."

"That is true, they cooperation with Kobe University and have found the reagent for identify Covid-19. For common all Corona virus, Indonesia has do testing more than ten years. If positive, so the sample will be tested in Jakarta for assay, so will know what kinds of Corona Virus, needs about 2 days for it. With reagent needs only hours."
"Until nowadays there are no Covid-19 positive patient in Indonesia.There are one Indonesia citizen got Covid-19 positive in Singapore and 4 of Indonesian citizens got Covid-19 positive in Diamond Princess Cruise Ship as crews from 78 Indonesian crews means about 5 percent. But more than a fourth or more than 25 percent of the 1,700 passengers got Covid-19 positive, means high risk to use cruise ship. Most of the passengers are old persons, whereas most of the crew are young persons. So, if you are healthy and still young, you are more safe than if you are old person."
"Thank you for the reassurance Sarwa. It’s promising to know that people returning to Australia from Indonesia are free from the virus, that’s a positive. I will be traveling via Singapore next month and plan to avoid contact with people as much as possible. We don’t have a single case of the virus in SA so it is definitely possible not to have it and l really don’t think anyone is hiding something."
"You must take safe action outside Indonesia and outside SA, because 2 positive Covid-19 patients has been found in Iran. Until nowadays Africa is still safe."
"Follow-up to my previous comments - just to let you know came back from Bali last Thursday evening after 10 days unscathed except for damn mozzie bites from being at the Villa - take your Aeroguard or similar. If you want to feel safe on the plane and airport then get your family the right masks but it's the hand sanitising which is more important (as it should be anyway). I was the only one that I saw wear one on way up in plane and didn't worry on way home - not many people even in streets etc wearing them there.Read up on the Virus symptoms and how to catch it. I read it was only 4-5 hours window and mainly from surfaces and then you touch your facial orefaces and bam you MAY get it, so just watch the public things.I only saw one young woman in Matahari with a head cold and she is the one who should have had a mask on.Only person on my home plane trip who had a mask on was an elderly lady and me being 67 not much older than myself. The local are feeling the pinch from people cancelling and are struggling again. The Hotel where I stayed initially - The Green Garden - said it was quieter than usual and same with drivers and taxis I used while there.So go and spend lots of money as their economy needs it too. I also heard Singapore is very quiet on the streets too so all this drama is having an effect everywhere.Enjoy your time with family and if you feeling uncomfortable around someone coughing and spluttering (which may only be a cold) just do normal cautions.ENJOY!"
PS sorry - stayed in a Villa in Jimbaran Village area and wasn't really in a lot of Public places often like general shopping malls etc so your isolation there may be okay. Just buy some Glen 20 or similar when you get there and wipe things down that bubs may touch or lick just as a precaution.
Glen 20 is a good idea travelynnemiles.
"I’m here at the moment with 2 kids. There were a few people at the airport wearing masks, but that’s it. I have no concerns about Coronavirus over here. I’d be more worried about the transit through Thailand - I’d wear a mask there. We brought P2 masks over with us (we needed them at home with the bushfires) but haven’t felt the need to wear them in Bali."
vishal cIts safe you can visit Bali without any tension.but better to carry mask you never know anything can happen as many Chinese tourist travelling Bali and other Asian countries.
"I agree with Dipen N. So far no announcements have been made about coronavirus cases in Indonesia, but probably it is a just a matter of time. It's starting to spread globally now and Indonesia is one of the only countries in Asia not to have announced any cases despite there being a lot of contact with China and lots of Chinese visitors. Unfortunately it seems many people are more concerned about being quarantined than about having the virus.Anyway, it sounds fine to visit Bali for now, just bring good quality face masks just in case (they will sell out almost immediately if any case is confirmed) and bring plenty of hand sanitizer."
The one thing to be aware of is does your travel insurance cover you? Otherwise go for it!
"One thing to be aware of is that most travel insurances exclude pandemics from coverage so if WHO does declare Covid-19 a pandemic, it will not cover any coronavirus-related expenses."
"Further to Robin’s post (# 22), I checked with our insurance company, Insure & Go, this morning for our trip later in May. They advised that we’ll be covered if the Australian Government issues a Do Not Travel advisory. Otherwise, there’s no other cover. Fingers crossed that it doesn’t come to that and this somehow settles down. Cheers"
"Hi Baileybum , I am travelling to Bali in May and my travel insurance provider has issued a blanket ""No"" any pandemic/epidemic.Can you please confirm that your insurance provider will only cover you if the Australian government issues a ""Not Safe To Travel "" warning. I thought that warning would have negated any form of travel insurance.Edited: 10:09 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"Hi Limited Edition, that’s right. We’re only covered by a Not Safe to Travel warning. No mention of pandemics whatsoever. I’m going to contact Luxury Escapes (who we booked through) to ascertain their position on this as well. Cheers"
"Hi Baileybum , That is an interesting clause. A few TA members are fortunately covered by Insurers such as TID and Southern Cross.1 Cover werent that compliant.Goodluck with enquiries!!..Safe Travels"
"Thanks LE, same to you. Cheers"
"BailyBum, can you please post the reply you get from Luxury Escapes, please, as we are booked through them for an 8 night Bali stay in June, and I am getting a bit concerned. We have one chance to change accommodation bookings outside of 45 days before check-in."
Me too - but we are more concerned about being in an aircraft and airports than in Bali coming from Oz. I'll be masking up I think.
Yep - agree.
"Will do, Kevin. Luxury Escapes have warned it might take some time to reply to my query due to the number of inquiries people are making. Cheers"
"Singapore Airlines have cancelled some of their flights to and from the USA, however l got an email from them yesterday telling me of their huge infrastructure that they have put in place to keep passengers safe, pleased to see they are scrubbing down all aircraft beforehand, keeping passengers in safe areas in transit and everyone gets screened on arrival in Singapore. Luckily SA doesn’t have a single case of the virus and people are going on holiday as normal, hope someone doesn’t come back with the virus."
"Bali is safe, at least is for China Tourists who will stay longer in Bali, Indonesia.For the second time Indonesian Government has given Special Visa to almost 1,000 China Tourists who will extent to stay longer in Indonesia for the next 30 days. One month ago more than 1,200 China Tourists apply for Special Visa and all has been given.Previously there are a plane want to pickup China Tourists from Bali. But only about 80 persons do it. The plane is very empty, because the capacity of the plane is about 300 passengers."
"Post 33, please be honest in your posts. You know that Bali is at risk as much as anyhere else in the world. What we all need to weigh up is mass infection, and the capability of a country's infrastructure to cope with this."
"Singapore Airlines, as great as they are, cannot control the virus or it's spread. It's no secret that Asian based airlines have had many cancellations, so all are doing their best to try to reasure existing passengers while simultaneously attempting to minimise substantial financial losses. If you want an example of what it really takes to disinfect a large aircraft, have a look at what Qantas did recently after they collected Aussies from China. Compare the two and then rethink just how effective SIA's measures will actually be. Cheers"
Scary.... FP - l can only hope for the best and lm happy at least they are doing something.
"From the Financial Times this morning: Headline - ""Bali doctor: if there is a coronavirus patient, I'll be infected""Medical workers have warned that the Indonesian holiday island of Bali is severely underprepared to deal with the deadly coronavirus, threatening its 4m inhabitants and a tourist industry worth billions of dollars each year.Interviews with staff at the three Bali hospitals earmarked to treat victims of a virus that has infected more than 80,000 people around the world point to a lack of equipment, staff and infrastructure required to deal with an outbreak.“I’m not convinced,” Ni Ketut Pande Sri Widnyani, senior doctor at Sanjiwani Gianyar hospital, one of the facilities, said of Bali’s ability to handle such a crisis. “Right now we’re not up to the required standard,” she said of the hospital. “There’s a lack of facilities and I pray we won’t be infected.”Indonesia, the world’s fourth-most populous country, has yet to report a single confirmed case of the coronavirus despite its strong economic ties with the rest of Asia and especially China where the illness originated. Given that the virus has quickly spread to almost 40 countries, international experts question whether this is credible.“The fact that Indonesia has not reported any cases is highly unusual,” said Ian Mackay, a virologist at Queensland University in Australia, noting that Bali was a top destinations for travellers from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak. “In a major destination for visitors from China we would expect to see infected patients.”Bali is considered particularly exposed to a virus outbreak because of its popularity with mainland Chinese who accounted for 1.2m of its more than 6m international visitors last year.After China declared the outbreak in January some of these tourists extended their stay in Bali rather than going home. A large number of Indonesians also work in China, often as domestic helpers...https:/…56159baa-569d-11ea-a528-dd0f971febbc"
"Hi guys! My fam (husband and 1 and 3 year old) are due to go to Bali with a Luxury Escapes deal on the 14th March. I called luxury escapes, long hold time, and was advised it’s at the hotel’s discretion if they allow us to change dates as we are inside of the 45 day allowable period. Luxury Escapes contacted our hotel, cc’ing me, and the hotel have said that while Bali is safe, they will allow me to rebook up until Dec this year. Tail watching and waiting, but I think I’ll change our dates to go later in the year."
"Thanks froweoverseas, we’re still waiting to hear back from Luxury Escapes re our May holiday. It’s good to hear there may be some flexibility re current bookings. Cheers"
Hi just wanted to maybe offer some advice I'm only flying in September to bali but have been keeping a careful eye on the spread of the Corona virus I found the best up to date truthful unbiased report is on the w.h.o websiteAnd it gives all the stats confirmed cases etc...maybe this will help you.
Hello guys please tell me the update of corona virus in bali...
"Hi,The president said today that they have two confirmed cases of corona in Indonesians who were in contact with the Japanese tourists who came to indonesia with the virus. There may be more cases but it’s not clear from the statement how extensive the tracing of contacts is. CheersEdited: 1:01 am, March 02, 2020 "
"As of this morning we have decided to cancel our visit to Bali. Sadly the villa company “Asia Holiday Retreats” has said that they cannot refund our money or allow us credit to use this in the future, which is sad. I know the hospitality business has been hit bad but to hold you ransom when the world is on the brink of a global pandemic is just silly."
NayanBest to check the w.h.o website for all up to date information.
Vishal can you not claim against your travel insurance?
No intention of canceling my Bali trip and don't quite understand peoples 'panic' (probably because they are the first 3 and last 2 letters of 'pandemic').Pandemic means widespread. Does not mean epidemic. I am more worried about the Italians at work who travel back and forth to Italy every weekend.If it was prevalent in Bali despite the 'iffy' Indonesian reporting of cases I'm pretty sure given the number of Ozzies traveling to Bali every week if some had brought it back to Oz we'd know about it pretty quickly.
https:/…12016802Here you go!
"I am travelling to Bali in June and from what I read on the net, the Virus might well be around after the flu season is over. I have non refundable Air Tickets pre booked with Singapore Airlines. So I think I am going to go and tell myself that it is as likely to infect me in India as in Bali. 2 cases reported today in Indonesia and 2 cases in India as well.Please tell me, friends, that I am taking the right call :)"
"Thanks Luigi! That was as comforting as it gets , lol!"
Hi SantanuChYour post was so refreshing as it is what I have been mentioning to your fellow countrymen all along. I most sincerely hope that you have a great time and very much enjoy your holiday.
I've been travelling Asia since Dec 8. I've been asked so many times if people should cancel their trips.I made a little 9 minute vlog about what I've seen and my thoughts on going vs cancelling. If you have a few min... Take a look. Hope it helpshttps://youtu.be/SdZzhd1yH6YP.S. In Bali now (for almost 2 weeks) ... I realllllly wouldn't worry about it. No one os wearing masks. Not a single person has so much as sneezed around me. Wash hands often. Try not to touch your face and you'll be fine.
"Luigi, a quote from Master and Commander no less, ""lesser of two weevils"". It sticks in my mind."
Thank you. We have a spring break trip leaving SFO and flying via Taipei to Bali at end of month. Hoping we don't have to cancel - mainly concerned about quarantines when returning back to California.
"Hi Vishal, just wanna ask you that you are still planning to go as I have also planned to Bali on 11 mar and confused whether its safe or not."
"Parul V, Vishal advised that he / she has cancelled in post #43."
"Hi Parul and welcome to Trip Advisor.Are you aware that cases of people with this virus have been recorded in India? If so, why would you think that Bali would be less safe than your own country?"
"@travelkat88 - India now has over 28 confirmed cases of the virus. Bali lists only 2...Its not about Bali being safer than India - its just that when you travel, you tend to go out more - visit public places - eat out at busy areas and come in contact with far more people than you would on your average day being in your home country. The bigger worry is to go through air ports and such because of the number of people that go through them everyday. If it were not for travel, the virus would have not spread outside of Wuhan in the first place.Just my two bits."
"@Parul - I have gone ahead and cancelled my trip, I know many that are still going ahead with their travel plans, so I guess its to each his own...I just felt it was not worth the risk, especially as I had my parents and children on this trip with me."
"I didn't know that Bali had any confirmed cases. I know there are two confirmed cases in Jakarta which is nearly 1200 km away. However, it seems that Indonesians are becoming more concerned and getting worried. Vishal, each to his own, and with young kids and myself not so young anymore I would probably do as you have done."
Funny as from current reports young kids aren't at risk. Kids under 10 don't seem to be susceptible (quite how a virus knows your age at that age I don't know). Kids More likely to just be carriers than suffer anything of the affects. Basically the older you are the riskier it is.
"It's definitely to each his own. No one should be judging anyone if they decide to postpone their plans.What we know so far is that this is hitting the body harder than the regular flu. Also, the mortality rate is higher than the regular flu. It's rubbish to say that if you aren't scared of the flu, you shouldn't be scared of COVID-19... On the flipside, there shouldn't be sheer panic.Yes, I did see initial reports that say it seems that kids are less susceptible for getting sick. Again, scientists and health officials are still learning about this. It doesn't mean that kids are less likely to carry the virus. Hell, it could even be the opposite. Kids can still carry and spread. Some kids aren't showing symptoms even though the have the COVID-19. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/03/who-says-cor…https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/w…I decided to include news articles from credible sources when I post facts, so people can read the articles for themselves. I like to do what I can as to not spread innuendos and misinformation."
Hi i have also planned to visit bali on march 11 so did you decide ? Whether you are going or not ?
Ignorance is bliss.....if anyone thinks Bali is coronavirus free you need to rethink your life. It will be a mess once the truth is out. For the person who said you could get it at home!!!!! Well at home better health care. Bali increases 55% of complications due to very poor health system.
I'm leaving Bali on the 10th...it's perfectly safe in my opinion.. I've seen like 8 people wearing masks.. I personally wouldn't postpone
"Post #64... Most sees are mild (81%) you have a higher chance dying from the flu. It's fear and hype.. Trust me, been in asia since December.. You dont get to see how normal most countries are here... I completely understand the fear and concern, so of course you need to do what's right for you and your loved ones.. But honestly i see how things are here.. No need to be afraid"
"Mickey, there's a higher chance of dying from the flu simply because more people have had the seasonal flu vs the COVID-19. COVID-19 is very new and still unfolding...COVID-19 actually has a higher death rate than the seasonal flu. You can look at my previous posts for my sources or Google that information on any credible news source. So what you have repeated isn't an accurate statistic. I'm not trying to get into a debate, but I just had to clarify that"
"NotaPigsty: you wrote “Pandemic means widespread. Does not mean epidemic”. That is incorrect.The WHO has this definition: A pandemic is defined as “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people”."
"Hey Cat,Fair enough. I based it on a few different articles I read. Including this one: https:/…coronavirus-reasons-to-be-reassuredI agree theres a lot of info and at the same time lack there of. Not to mention the misinformation. It's hard to know whats right, even from solid government sources which then is the corrected/update. No debate here. Gotta do what's right for you. My perspective, it's more of a threat to elderly people and those with underlying issues. I know fewr sells subscriptions.. Good news, not so much so people are jumping on the fear wagon. That's my opinion. I very much respect yours and hope you and your loved ones stay healthy and well :)"
"I doubt that there are zero corona virus cases in Bali. It may be true that there are zero DETECTED cases in Bali since the majority of COVID-19 infections are harmless and remain undetected. The fatality rate of around 2% only applies to the (largely elderly vulnerable) people who are already showing symptoms and sometimes suffering from serious complications such as pneumonia. But this is almost certainly only a small minority of the actual number of infections. The danger of COVID-19 seems similar to seasonal flu. The real danger is the mass hysteria which is promoted by irresponsible media and government officials who are worried about being seen as indecisive!Edited: 1:02 am, March 08, 2020 "

Here's another article;https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/…In summary - a woman from Jakarta was diagnosed in Melbourne. Seems very likely she contracted it in Indonesia. Jakarta and Bali are miles away from each other and certainly parts of Australia have many cases themselves. I do feel though that once you start exporting cases it becomes a lot more difficult to claim you only have four cases nationwide with any credibility.

Hi SoulwaxThere was one case reported yesterday in Singapore of an Indonesia woman coming in already infected. Indonesia is doing a good job in hiding facts and not preventing the spread of Covid-19.You definitely deserve a medal from the Indonesian govt.
"Soulwax, I agree that is fairly evident that Indonesia absolutely does not have widespread coronavirus in the thousands like Italy, Korea and Iran. But there is a fairly big range between 6000 and 4. Indonesia does indeed appear to have been lucky thus far (considering their lax testing and contact tracing) and I sincerely hope their luck continues, but as you say - time will tell."
"Hi JanceI got no idea how to rationalise that with a grand total of 4 reported cases, Singapore already had one imported case from Indonesia?"
"sing6363 there are no reports in the Straits Times or elsewhere on searches to support your claims. What is the source for your statement.Edited: 9:12 am, March 08, 2020 "

sing6363 my query in post 80 refers to your posts 75 & 79
"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapo…Singapore has just announced a second import case of Covid-19 from Indonesia. See Case No 147 in attachment and case 148 would also be of interest. As at today, Indonesia has 6 reported cases. How on earth can Singapore have 2 Indonesian import cases when Indonesia supposedly has only 6 in a country with a population of 200+ million.? My guess is there should be at least 10,000 cases in Indonesia for 2 of them to have been imported in Singapore."
Smartraveller have just posted that Coronavirus in Indonesia and that Bali medical facilities will not have infrastructure to cope Also no testing in Bali Travel advice not increased but does advise about lack of medical care to manage
"So many gullible posts here. I would bet London to a brick there are hundreds of cases in Indonesia and Bali with the amount of Chinese travellers they had in Dec, Jan and part of Feb. Being in denial will eventually come back and bite. When someone catches the disease they wont know because they can't test for it properly. When someone dies, they will call it swine flu or something else - anything but coronavirus. It's all about the $$$ folks.Just as I don't for one second believe cases are slowing in China - absolute nonsense. They tell you what they want you to know - doesn't mean you need to believe it!Edited: 9:28 am, March 08, 2020 "
If it is rife in Bali why isn’t there plane loads of Australians coming down with it
"Hi MichelleMaybe not so rife in Bali as compared to other cities in Indonesia. But it is a matter of time before plane loads of aussies return back with the virus., as long as Indonesia refuses to acknowledge the spread."
In Indonesia there are more many cases of Dengeu Fever than Covid-19. Because mosquito can fly a hundred meter and no need close contact among the victims. Covid-19 usually needs close contact among/between the victims.
"Amit. There is no way that anyone who are travellers just like you, would be able to answer your question.I understand that you don’t want to make your own decision and would prefer that others make that for you, however in this situation, you will have to decide for yourself as difficult as that would be."
"Further to Travelkat’s advice, Amit, you firstly need to consider whether anyone in your travel party has any health issues that may place them at risk should they contract this virus. Seek advice from your medical practitioner, read your government’s travel advisories and check the advice from the World Health Organisation. Cheers"
"There are at least 11 suspects of Covid-19 in Bali, but all are Negative.Jakarta has more suspects of Covid-19 and nowadays there are 6 positive Covid-19 patients. When there are initial 2 positive Covid-19 patients, there are panic situation, but nowadays not anymore, however some of them, not much use masker. Myself not use anything, because I have no close contact with any Covid-19 patient."
+1 LeeLou
"sing6363 - Regarding the cases you quote in your post 83, namely - Sing. Govt. case 147 and 148. You have used the intro of ""Singapore has just announced a second import case of Covid-19 from Indonesia. ""Case 148 is linked to a cluster of infections that occurred at a private dinner function at SAFRA Jurong in Singapore. Actually I believe it is the largest and most well known Singapore clusterhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/safra…Case 147 is an Indonesian national who arrived in Singapore yesterday, 7th Feb, and tested positive today, 8th of February. There is no mention of which country he arrived ""from"". As for being the second ""import case"" - that can only be referring to the already discredited story you posted last week about people from another small enterprise cluster of infections in Singapore who took the ferry to Batam island and tested positive some days later. Their prior links to numerous infections at ""Wiizlearn"", their place of work in Singapore, are highlighted in the government records."

"Can anyone here comment on access to testing in Bali? And how much it costs? I read from a minister or head of health authority announcement that the quick test is available in Bali but for the more sensitive test, samples need to be sent to Jakarta.I've been advised by other countries through their consulates that I should carry test results with me when I leave Bali so I won't be denied entry.Thanks in advance."
"There are many suspects of Covid-19 in Bali, all are foreign tourists, but all are Negative.Jakarta has more suspects of Covid-19 and nowadays there are 6 positive Covid-19 patients. there are 3 steps, first step is patient in monitoring, there are hundreds of it and second is patient in supervision, there are only 10 patients of it, third step is positive Covid-19 patients and must stay in isolation room until 2 times negative test."
"With all due respect BB, the corrupt WHO would be among the last group I listen to re coronavirus. Remember, they were dead against any country stopping flights from China and they still refuse to label COVID-19 a pandemic despite the virus being present in 109 countries and rising. CheersEdited: 5:15 am, March 09, 2020 "
I would definately agree that the credibility of the WHO needs to be seriously questioned.They are obviously serving the needs of corporate multi nationals and corrupt NGO's.
"Interesting... #97 + 98 it’s amazing that people could compromise human life over money, shocking."
"Okay, ignore advisories from WHO but ensure you seek appropriate government and medical advice."
Totally agree my fellow Perthians. WHO are a bunch of YES men. Bowing and scraping and back slapping the leaders of the nation where this all started. Work that one out!!
"Nowadays there are 19 positive Covid-19 patients in Indonesia, include 2 foreigners, but the release not mention the citizenship. It is increasing a lot from 6 positive Covid-19 patients. And there are 21 persons as Covid-19 suspect.In China, new cases are declining and who get well are more than in isolation. So, Disney in China is already opened, after several days are closed due to Covid-19."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapo…Case 152 and 153 in article above proves Covid-19 is widespread in Indonesia.

"We are travelling to Bali on 13th from Australia and everything is booked and paid for. Our insurance does not cover us for Coronavirus. Can anyone please give us the true picture of Corv19 in Bali? We have been told that the hospital system can not cope with an epidemic and that the Governor allowed Viking Star cruises to disembark passengers to fly home to Australia or take tours on the weekend. Apparently, all passengers and crew had temperature tests done before they left the ship and the authorities took all precautions but we are still wondering whether to travel."
SG - that’s pretty concerning. Looks like Indonesia’s luck might have run out.
Were the 19 cases in Bali or elsewhere?
I think these temperature tests give a false sense of security
"The latest import case to Singapore is a rich Indonesian who was already diagnosed of the virus in Jakarta, but decided to hire a PRIVATE plane (to avoid the stricter checks at airports) to get treated in Singapore, which is well known for its high quality healthcare with zero deaths so far, despite having 150+ cases of Covid-19. Only 0.001% of the Indonesian population can afford to hire private plane. And if someone from this 0.001% segment can get infected with Covid-19, even a 1 0 year old should be able to figure out the extent of the spread of Covid-19 in Indonesia. It should easily exceed 10000 cases,"

How is Bali doing? Still busy?
"@105 Chrissie, I am flying to Bali on Saturday. I have been weighing things up almost hourly and if before then I really feel I am at greater risk than here at home, I just won't get on the plane. But right now I feel comfortable continuing with my travel plans.There are posters who flood these threads with conflicting news, most just googled and claim they are all facts. They are not all fact. A WA tourism official has said Australian's should not go to Bali because the money could be better spent in WA. He did not say don't go to Bali because it's dangerous.Don't ask others what they would do, just do what makes you feel ok,"
I think possibly the concern is more for the flight than being in the actual country.
Sarwa give it a rest - pleeeeease !
All facts must be declared transparently. Are you hide something?
Nothing to hide in Oz
"Sarwa G is the precise epitome of ""Lord Haw Haw"" during WW2Propagandist."
"So, Sarwa, can you provide a link regarding fee free treatment at these Bali Hospitals?"
"Baileyburn can you give a link that BIMC give free treatment for the patients. I heard by myself from the Health Minister that all Covid-19 are free, because all hospitals in Indonesia which more than 100 and can handle Covid-19 are Government Hospitrals."
"Sarwa, don’t be a smart alec. I politely asked for a link to the government’s advisory re hospital treatment allegedly being free. This is important for travellers to Bali. They can’t rock up to a hospital and tell the staff “A bloke called Sarwa said there aren’t any fees”, can they?"

"I know that the testing for Covid-19 is free at government hospitals in Indonesia as long as you have a letter from a doctor, but not sure if that letter can be from any doctor or specifically from a doctor at the government hospital.The government call centre hotline is 112 to get information about Corona virus, and 119 if you feel you may have it or know someone who may have it. But I have no idea if they speak English."
Free for tourists ? I'd like to see that in writing.

"Thank you, Sarwa. For the benefit of forum members, the translated section reads as follows:Diseases caused by COVID-19 are not covered by BPJS Health but directly by the State. This is because BPJS Health's funding sources come from temporary participant contributions because COVID-19 is included in an outbreak, the funding must be directly from the State with funding from the Ministry of Health, Regional Government, or other funding sources deemed valid by law regulations. I think SurfingWild’s advice in post #124 is certainly helpful."
The Call Center even has a Chinese speaking person.
"Just want to share a link , mealtime update about COVID 19 all are the world https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Indonesia has 27 case of COVID19 Stay healthy keep clean , guys Cheers D"
Additional 8 cases are 3 from domestic infections and 5 are imported cases means when they entered Indonesia there are great possibility that the patients are in the incubation period.
"I'm going to Bali in a couple of weeks with my family. Much safer there, than here in Europe. It seems that the Indonesian authorities are taking this more seriously than here, with screenings and sanitizing the Denpassar Airport etc. Of course they have to, since they are so dependent of tourists visiting.Here in the more developed part of the world (northern Europe) we still see people arriving from northern Italy (Corona epicenter in Europe) without being screened or anything. Upon arriving in the airport they are free to roam and can head straight into the airport subway for example.Edited: 4:07 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"In case of emergency during your trip in Indonesia , please follow the link below List of 100 Covid-19 Referral Hospitals in IndonesiaFrom ACEH to PAPUA https://indonesia.go.id/layanan/kesehatan/ek…Stay healthy keep clean , guys Ps : no worries the link in English Cheers D"
"I really don’t understand the extreme panic, travel as normal, we always wear face masks in the airport and on the plane, and use disinfectant etc. that’s been our normal routine. I honestly don’t know why you would get on a filthy plane with recycled air without any sort of respiratory protection, yuck."
"An aviation expert on tv this morning was detailing how air in a plane is 50/50 fresh/recycled and is pumped through hepa air filters which destroy 99% of contaminents and bacterial agents and is only in a cabin for 2 min before replaced again so in actual fact the air in a plane is very clean, I googled it and appears that is quite true."
Thank you
"Someone that coughs or sneezes in Seat 45B can project airborne particles many many rows in front...before it gets to the HEPA filter. Also when passing through airports you share the same air as people from many unknown origins, and also make contact with taps, handles, counters etc, as same people. This is why getting to the destination can be more dangerous than the destination."
Add to that paying with credit or debit cards and using ATM machines....it all increases the risk.
Only quoting what he stated.
"Just quoting what I think Dianne, not having a go. I have kept out of most of these discussions, cos my opinion doesn't matter.Doesn't matter if a destination is Covid19 free, getting there is not......and cash SurfingWildEdited: 3:18 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Point taken Greg I get what you're saying but I do think the whole thing is becoming a bit hysterical, the constant media dramatic coverage is just causing for the majority of people unnessary panic."
"Agree with you Dianne W The era of internet is so open for everything, back in time when the world attack by others virus, that moment still less internet user , such as social media etc ... less drama etc Cheers D"
"That's exactly right, we're just saturated with doom and gloom 24/7 whereas in days gone by with anything like this you got a half hour of the gloom on the 6 o'clock nightly news and an article in the daily paper."
"This virus was kind of non-existent about 10 weeks ago, it is now in 115 of 195 countries, (105 yesterday) that is WITH containment policies. This is big, and only in its infancy.The good news is, that if you had to have a virus/pandemic, this is a good one to have compared to most others. It's not like it's Man Flu!Edited: 4:05 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Yesterday i went to night safarivery surprised to see its still pretty crowded (around 100 pax, 90% of them international tourist ,mostly australian i think )no one was using mask, just i can see many put hand sanitizers on their table when having dinnerso from what i see , tourism in bali is still on till today .. although news says its down by 50 percent compared to normal days."
"BTW , covid 19 first death was just recorded in indonesia (in bali) 53yrs woman from england.. news said she already had diabetes and longtime lung diseases beforehand"
"Qures, was the lady a tourist or an expat? Which area? Thank you in advance."
"How sad for the lady and her family.It seems she was a tourist. https://7news.com.au/lifestyle/health-wellbe…Edited: 5:29 am, March 11, 2020 "
I read today there were two foreigners included in yesterdays new cases. I'm assuming the unfortunate lady was one of them. I also noted that in the report Achmad had refused to disclose the location of the cases. I find this a little unsettling.https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/03/…
"I read the same, Sarah. If authorities refuse to disclose this location, it will hardly be reassuring - particularly given they’ve previously identified other locations such as Batam and Depok."
"Apparently she is British, 53, and died in Bali."
"Apparently several of the people infected with the virus have asked the government not to publicize their names, where they live etc as it created so many problems for the first confirmed in Depok. In western countries it might not be a problem, but here in Indonesia giving out too much information can be dangerous to those people with the virus as others might take matters into their own hands."
"#151 Its actually just the location we need, the province or the district, in first case they tell names and address, that was very wrong"
"Extremely sad for the womans family, and scary that infected people fear retribution. I don't necessarily think that this fear is isolated to Indonesia however."
"And please refrain from posting about the womans travel history and whether she was infected in Indonesia. It is irrelevant. The fact is she was infected, and there is a chance she infected others on her travels, be it in Indoensia or any other country."
Is this the same Health Minister Achmad who said that only by the hand of his Allah has Indonesia not had any positive infections?
Achmad leads the Ministry of Health's Directorate General of Disease Control. The prayerful Minister is Terawan Agus Putranto.
Thanks for that clarification BB.Cheers
I couldn't agree with you more about wanting to know the location of the confirmed cases. Here in Bandung we suspect that there are probably many cases and it's just frustrating that we do not know for sure.
She and her family were staying at the four seasons hotel
"you may read it,12. Re: Quarantine at ImmigrationMar 11, 2020, 9:20 AMthe woman is 53 yo, quarantine at sanglah hospital since 9 march 2020 and 2 days later pass away.until nowadays there are no result of the test which must do in jakarta. the patient get severe chronic disesases, diabetes, hypertension, hyperthyroid, and chronic lung obstruction. there are possibility the patient get positIve covid-19 and it will worsen the severe chronic diseases."
"No one has an immunity to this virus and yes, it will have its greatest impact on the elderly and/or those with existing health issues, but it will also be the very young who also will have little ability to fight this, so we need to consider all those who will be most affected during this health crisis. It is not like a regular influenza season, this is something entirely new.. Very little is still known about how it might change, how long it will remain and when we might see some immunisation protection available.We all need to take care and I dearly hope we see some good news soon in regard to this virus's spread."
"Hi Sawa G,I’m reading that Jakarta confirmed that the patient was Cov19 positive to the local hospital.Cheers"
"Great words, Sue"
"paulosussex. yes, it make me confuse, maybe they make the second test, because maybe there are positive false, it is common for the test, however the accuracy is high.when indonesia evacuate 89 persons indonesian crew of diamond pricess cruise ship from japan, all have been tested use pcr and all has negative result. evacuation use airplane and landing at kertajati airport near midnight, when all passengers and most airport employees have stayed in their houses. use buses to go to indramayu electric port and then use navy hospital ship to sebaru kecil for quarantine. the trip need only for hours, but the ship disembark after several days and only for 68 persons. one persons has gone and after several days later found in perhabatan hospital for quarantine, he got positive covid-19. there are great possibility he is in incubation period when he is evacuated.so, for release someone from quarantine need 2 negative pcr to avoid negative false. negative false is more dangerous than positive false."
Hi. Did you go? We are going on the 21st. How are the kids? I’m curious to know what experience you are having. Thank you
who has stated covid-19 as global pandemic.
"This is extremely concerning!! 'A 53-year-old foreign woman holidaying in Bali became Indonesia's first COVID-19 fatality on Wednesday, but local authorities were only informed after her death that she had tested positive for the disease.'https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/03/…Hear no evil, see no evil. And people are willing to put their life in the hands of the Indonesian authorities who keep dangerous secrets from each other??Edited: 5:31 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"A very reasonable observation, FP. It’s also concerning that CV tests have to be sent to Jakarta for results confirmation. It would be interesting to know if this is the case for all of Indonesia?"
"Well said Sue C, your always very level headed and pretty spot on with your advice. Karen D. Yes I think your decision not to go ATM is very sensible , I too have deferred my trip in 2 weeks and will now go at Xmas ,that is if its all good by then.Take care everyone and if you choose to go please be very careful with hygiene, I personally think it is only a short time away before Airlines stop flying there.Edited: 8:31 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"there one person in jembrana has status as in monitoring, but has been isolated. the other 2 stages are under supervision and positive of covid-19.in indonesia nowadays there are 34 cases of positive covid-19, one person pass away and 4 persons are get well.most of the patients are imported cases, 19 persons mean they get the virus from outside indonesia, but when enter indonesia can pass the thermal scanner, because the body temperature is lower than 38 degrees celsius."
"Given this latest report, concerns are certainly heightening https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/03/…"
"USA has closed visitors from mainland Europe, exclude UK. Kuwait even stop all flights from/to Kuwait. Seems imported cases are more dominant than domestic cases infection.The most busiest international route is Jakarta to Singapore vv. Whereas in Bali is from Australia, whereas there are no flights anymore from mainland China.If Indonesia, Singapore and Australia can handle the Covid-19 well, so the countries do not need follow USA action or even Kuwait extreme action."
"Interesting report, Baileybum.I see QLD have just reported a case where the person recently returned from Indonesia (no indication of where in Indonesia)."
"Sadly today 12th March we have cancelled our 21 day trip to Bali. We had saved for 12 months for this and were so looking forward to it but given my conversations with friends living there and the fact that WHO have upped it to pandemic we felt we had no choice. Better to be safe and sorry at home than away particularly with my husband having a medical issue and insurance not covering for Coronavirus. Even locals are not sure what is occurring as news is very scarce. Expect to say that hours have been cut and many locals are worried. We have lost money but better this than the alternative. We will just support the island later .See you later in the year Bali and we here hope you are all ok...Edited: 2:59 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Don't feel sad Christine, you are not alone. I was 2 weeks away from going, and now just hope its all over on October/ November. Yes better to be safe than sorry. I actually following a call to my airline was helped no end to change my flight to a later date. I think Airlines are being very flexible with this and need to keep customers, as they know it will end at some stage."
"I have thought about my trip hourly but have decided to go as planned on Saturday. Looking at how it is in Australia shows it is rife everywhere.I can read and do so constantly so really don't see the need for people to keep,posting media links here. Especially as most just want to post the negatives. We are not all doomed to die.I will probably not have facials and will not be going to busy centres but I think I can relax around my pool and eat at good restaurants .My choice :) I fully understand those who made a choice to cancel."
"Have a great trip Hunter, take care of yourself. I’m getting over all this stuff too. Hope I’m right for June!! X"
we were due to go in just over 4 weeks going to try and change flights and hotel to june/July hoefuly hotels and flight price difference wont be too much
"Latest update from DFAT via smartraveller.gov.auIndonesia Indonesia has confirmed a number of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases. A foreign tourist with COVID-19 died in Bali on 11 March 2020. Consider carefully your need to travel to Indonesia, including Bali, at this time if you have an underlying health condition that may put you at greater risk. There is limited availability of testing and infection control facilities. The risk of transmission of the virus is increasing. Critical care for Australians who become seriously ill, including in Bali, is likely to be significantly below the standards available in Australia. Medical evacuation to Australia may be not be possible and, if it is, very expensive. It may not be covered by travel insurance. Be prepared for travel delays and disruptions, including taking into account what this might mean for your health, and your family, work or study responsibilities."
"HNR I guess as I'm here now arrived on the 7th didn't want to start a new thread so posting here.Plane from Brisbane was 95% full, a bit slow through immigration as had to do the yellow form but not to bad. It is certainly pretty quiet in the Kuta/Legian area, some of you will get this but two times in the last two days I have cruised down JL Legian on my scooter from Legian to Kuta at 30 kph without stopping, just had to swing around a few taxis.. yes it’s quiet.Hand sanitiser doesn't seem to be available, Ive tried a few good places with no luck.We have enough for now and are using it regularly along with hand washing with soap and water when we are home.Generally life here is pretty normal, no panic buying or anything like that.I jut want to comment on the news I’ve been reading, long lines and punch ups over toilet paper?I mean really, get real people, there are other ways.But the world has changed rapidly in the last four weeks, travel bans, stock market crashing etcJust a bit tongue in cheek though, I just read a Bunnings store in WA is going to be serving Vegan sausages for their sausage sizzle!!……….. whats the world coming to?I'm half expecting an earthquake tomorrow and Agung to start erupting again next week.Cheers."
Case 25 died on Tuesday in Bali. I posted it on a separate posting however members or TA closed it which is very bad move personally. Members at large should have a clear picture of what is happening.
I agree. I have no clue why that post was closed. I think it's relevant info according to TA rules.It's important to keep people informed.
"Number 182,the WHO Protocol do not allow to transfer who get positive Covid-19 to other country until negative test result.Because it is pandemi, so Indonesian government will treat the patient of positive Covid-19 for free.You may read number 126."

"Good to see some are still travelling and I am sure when you listen to the news too much you become paranoid as negative sells. In saying that I, my wife and 9 month newborn are due to fly out on the 22nd and I am most likely going to postpone. If it was just my wife and I then no problem I would go and take advantage of 5* corona discounts but not taking the risk with new born although young people seem not affected anywhere.The main reason I see is that I have never been to Bali so I want to explore everywhere. To go to a place for the first time and be constantly thinking of not touching this and staying away from crowded places including restaurants and gatherings I think would take the shine of the trip. Going to cost $300 to change flights with Jet* but some friends of ours cancelled their 5* organised trip to Cambodia and Vietnam and lost 50k so plenty of people worse off including those in the poor tourism industry."
"I am booked to go to Bali in 2 weeks. My husband and I are in our early 70s and my husband is a type 1 diabetic .I am very concerned about the quality of health care in Bali for those who become seriously ill, and also the poor testing for suspected cases .We are staying in a private villa and can isolate ourselves in the villa but my grandchildren and their parents who will be with us, would find that difficult and could possibly infect us . I feel I have no alternative but to cancel but I would be interested to hear the views of others. Thanks"
"Wendy, I travel to Bali on average twice a year. I was due to fly today but have cancelled. I am no sook - I work in the mining industry, outdoors in the hottest part of Australia. However, common sense in this case just had to prevail.Firstly, as I have stated before, guaranteed that Indonesia will have thousands of undetected cases. Luck plays no part in how this virus spreads. Being in denial is dangerous. From all accounts they don't have the facilities to test or cope, when they can't hide it any more.I would only believe the numbers coming from my own country, Western Europe, UK, Scandinavia, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong (basically IMO trustworthy countries) And even their numbers wont have captured all cases. The rest of the world's figures you can take with a grain of salt - also my opinion.Unfortunately, there are a couple of people on this post that dribble misinformation taken from their local newspapers and do it consistently and they may be sincere about what they are sprouting, but they can be sincerely wrong. Don't go."
"Wendy, you have to do what is best for you. No need to ask for anyone else's opinion.Good luck with whatever you decide. The most important thing is to get medical advice from your doctors. Not the peanut gallery on social media, lolEdited: 7:13 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"As Cat S states, you have to do what feels right for you and no one should be telling you don't go or do go.I m not in denial and I have been following this so carefully but I am flying tomorrow and I am feeling ok about it. Of course this virus has spread but that does not mean we are all in absolute danger.Thee are quite a lot of people living in Bali and are not dropping dead hourly. :);I saw my GP yesterday and was given the same advice most intelligent people give. Keep clean, be vigilant and stay safe. The main concern is of course the medical facilities there and I am aware of this .It is a really hard decision to make, but one only you can decide."
"number 191,Indonesia even better to test positive Covid-19 patient than USA. USA only test the patient once, whereas Indonesia do twice, first is Covid-19 test and then genome assay test.USA use lock down system to certain area. Indonesia trace one by one to close contact person with Covid-19 patient in cluster or sub-cluster.For who get type-1 diabetic you can visit hospital with medical doctor with the name as Dr xxx Sp PD KEMD. It is more than internist, but internist who learn more to get specialist of KEMD, Consultant of Endocrine, Metabolism and Diabetic."
Sorry Sarwa but that’s rubbish.Friends of mine just back from a quick 3 days in Bali and they didn’t get tested at all.Not saying they don’t do it but they are pretty slack as with most things in Indonesia unfortunately.
Sadly Indonesia is still bogged down with denials and 3rd World ethics and procedures and it will come back and bite them in time to come.
"Hi Wendy, the advice from posters, subsequent to your post, is very sound. My partner is immunosuppressed due to medical issues and, in considering the risks of contracting the virus, we sought a medical opinion from her treating medicos. In short, they advised us to cancel which we have consequently done. Seeking medical advice is paramount in these situations.Respectfully, poster #195 is not an epidemiologist or medical expert in these matters."
"You must learn more about it.There are many stages of test.You may read number 115,In monitoring stage, maybe they not testing anything, because based on anamnesis and clinical sight you are not Covid-19 patient.Are your friend a Covid-19 patient or he/she is still healthy. No use to test healthy person."

I've just finished reading an article in 'The Australian' newspaper where Bali authorities have said they have not ruled out temporarily locking out tourists to the island as they are not ready to deal with an outbreak and need their own laboratory for testing instead of the slow process of sending samples to Jakarta.
"Dianne, I cannot understand why the Indonesian government has not set up a lab for testing for Covid-19 in Bali, especially since it's where so many foreigners are coming into the country. This is getting a bit ridiculous.And agree totally with taking advice from so-called experts here in this forum on the Coronavirus. Anyone can quote from google or detik.com or any other news source without actually having any real knowledge or understanding of Covid-19, nor knowing the true situation in Indonesia.If you have any doubts just check with your GP."
"""I cannot understand why the Indonesian government has not set up a lab for testing for Covid-19 in Bali""You are a smart human. You understand precisely why they attempted to downplay COVID-19, as do the rest of us. It's a shame that Indonesia are now about to take a major hit in the hip pocket mainly because they refused to be transparent, let alone proactive. Now they are being called out for the cover ups and secrets. Chickens coming home to roost. CheersEdited: 5:16 am, March 13, 2020 "
"In the meantime former General Prabowo Subianto is quietly awaiting the opportunity to once again create civil unrest due to a fragile economy, superstitions and lack of virus transparency.Pass the popcorn as this is an evolving situation"
"I feel very sad and sick to my stomach , but at the midnight hour have decided not to go to Bali in the morning. My travel companions all decided not to travel right now so we have pulled out."
"I’m sorry to read that news, Hunter. It’s a bit disappointing to cancel with clear cut medical reasons but must be gut wrenching when you’re in good health and the risks are more grey than black and white. Hope you can reschedule soon. Cheers"
"Chickens are indeed coming home to roost, Fresh Prince, when the Jakarta Post publishes this:https:/…"
"Can understand people taking a logical approach and recognising, regardless of government advice, that traveling isn’t a good idea.Not Bali but I was supposed to go to the UK yesterday to visit my parents. This weekend is Cheltenham festival and dad/brothers big horse racing fans and although don’t go to the festival meet up for the craic. Dad (and mum) although not ill has basically put himself/themselves into self isolation to avoid people in general. Parents are in higher risk group anyway especially my dad. Me also. Didn’t help that my brother in law recently returned from “europe” (working trip) with a cold and fever."
"Yup, this has been my sentiments for the past several weeks.It's all about trying to protect the tourism dollars instead of doing what is morally right. A lab hasn't been set up because why report numbers when that will hurt tourism. If you don't have ample testing, then you don't have to report confirmed cases.It's like the old saying ""Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies"".I'm just glad that people are starting to take off the blinders and realize that things aren't making sense in Indonesia. Again, it's not about causing panic and doom or trying to ruin someone's vacation. But as inhabitants of this planet, we all need to be truly aware, informed, and educated to flatten the curve of this pandemic."
"BB, yes very telling. The piece admits that the government were paying social media and other 'influencers', to portray Indonesia as being open with nothing to worry about, theby leaving a pretty clear impression that tourist dollars were placed above health & safety. It's not a good look."
Not the least bit surprising though
"It's what I tried to day in my first post #7 on the 19th Feb, over three weeks ago. Bali contributes hugely to Indonesia's GDP, so they don't want to lose that. Of course it's all about money and it always was.Hunter, you won't have any regrets by cancelling. It's the sensible thing to do under the circumstances."
"My country has just issued a travel ban, so I will not be coming to Bali in a couple of weeks. So sad, but understandable. This is going to get much worse."
"I have a flight scheduled from Croatia (Zagreb) to Bali on 27 April, do you recommend waiting another month or so and then deciding?"
That’s a bummer Hunter. Take care of yourself x
"Zeki, personally I would postpone your visit if possible until the situation improves. The number of cases of coronavirus in Indonesia are going to increase more and more over the coming days and weeks. However, it really is up to you. Many people are still visiting Bali with no intention of cancelling."
"Just a heads up that a regional health authority has confirmed an Australian tourist in Queensland (Australia) has returned from Bali and tested positive to Coronavirus. Unfortunately, the link is via Facebook and I can’t post it. Cheers"
"Singapore has 10 imported Covid-19 cases from Indonesia. With an Indonesian population of 220 million, it would be fairly accurate to project that the total number of Covid-19 cases in Indonesia, should be in the region of 50,000."
"What people aren’t talking about and what I find super interesting is that Asia (besides China, Korea and Japan) is less affected than most other places in the world could it be the warm climate? According to WHO Australia currently has more cases than Malaysia, Singapore, HongKong, The Philippines, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam so are these countries all under reporting too?"
"Ivan A absolutely yes. You don't have to decide now. Things may change by then but I doubt it. No amount of money is worth catching this or transferring it to loved ones. Just because you could be in the ""safe"" age bracket, you could also be one of the few that catch it. It's not worth the risk.A friend of mine is the president of the AMA (Australian Medical Association) in Western Australia. Dr Andrew Miller - he is a practising Anaesthetist and a Lawyer. A very wise guy and I trust implicitly his direction. Google him and read his comments and you will be left in no doubt."
"As I said in number 199, There are many stages of test.People want test in the first stage also, but it is not necessary, even in this stage they are not in the isolation room, at the second stage they are in the isolation room, tests will be done, not directly test of Covid-19, but test of corona virus, if negative you will release from the second stage, if positive you will in the 3rd stage and the sample will be tested in Jakarta. Airlangga University in Surabaya can do it also and maybe will test it also soon. If the Covid-19 test is positive, there are the second test and it is called Genome DNA Assay Test to avoid False Positive of Covid-19 test. I do not know the other countries do also Genome DNA Assay Test or not.Usually in the second stage from 8 persons, only one is positive Covid-19 or even from 7 persons no one with positive Covid-19. In the second stage if someone has clinical sight of Covid-19, so without wait for Covid-19 test result can be transferred to third stage."
"Really, Sarwa, all you are doing here is muddying the waters. The simple fact is that the Indonesian government has been deliberately deceptive in downplaying this situation and is woefully unprepared to effectively manage prevention and care strategies."
"Related to number 115,Indonesia has add from 100 hospitals to 132 hospitals which can handle Covid-19. The previously 100 hospitals are available since 2007 when there are Bird Flu cases which the mortality rate is higher than Covid-19.Addition in Bali is Buleleng hospital in the northern Bali, from 3 hospitals to 4 hospitals.Addition in Jakarta from 3 hospitals to 8 hospitals."
"Sarwa you just have to succumb to reality, it's playing out exactly how we all aready knew it was going to."
"Just been announced as of midnight tonight anyone entering Australia compulsory isolation for 14 days is in force like NZ has also done, so obviously will also effect residents returning from holidays."

"Sorry to burst your bubble, Sarwahttps://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/03/…"
Sarwa G: you had better come up with some better propagandfa now that the australian Government has introduced mandatory self quarantine for returning Australians.If you thought the situation was bad it just got a whole lot worse and i fear even worse to come when Indonesians realize the gravity of the situation and that they have been duped.
And about time too Dianne.
"In all fairness, I believe the Indonesian government is trying to keep the situation under control. The last thing it wants is a panic situation because that is when people start looting the supermarkets and attacking wealthier people and worse. It's a fine balance that they need to keep. They do not want a repeat of the riots in 1998.Edited: 12:40 am, March 15, 2020 "
Be aware and prepared for civil unrest
"I’m seeing lots of fear but not much facts to back it up.I’m here in Bali at the moment and not worried about the coronavirus at all.Actually, I’d much rather be here than in my home country (US) where there have already been a lot more cases and deaths.I may be wrong but I don’t know of any hot/humid country that has had a bad outbreak of this coronavirus.Southeast Asia has an extremely close link to China and this region had detected cases of coronavirus long before Europe and the US, but it never blew up here the way it currently is there.Actually, the virus has been a complete joke in this part of the world. I’m much more worried about car accidents or dengue, which still kills hundreds (thousands?) every year.I’m also worried about the absurd knee jerk reactions from SE Asian countries locking down unnecessarily, like the decision from Cambodia to close after spotting only 7 cases in 2 months (and 0 deaths).I realize some of you think Indonesia is undercounting or covering up coronavirus cases, and that may be true to some extent, but it would be absolutely impossible and absurd to suggest that the virus has been catastrophic here the way it has been in Europe or China. And it would be equally absurd to suggest that every country in Southeast Asia has been doing some masterful coverup of mass casualties from this.Are you guys really trying to say that Singapore has had thousands of cases and deaths like Italy, but they’re hiding it? That is completely insane and paranoid.And what about Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, etc, where the virus has been detected in small quantities for months now but the effects have been undeniably mild?Things could change, but so far the FACT is, the virus has already been here for months and evidently it’s just not capable of doing much damage in this climate."
TA I have the same thoughts/questions as you in my post #225
"To number 234,Are self quarantine is allow for who visit Indonesia only or from other countries too. It is must clear, because when Saudi Arabia closed the umroh, who has many posts in TA mentioned that Saudi Arabia closed umroh from Indonesia, because the country afraid from Indonesian visitors, the truth is the country closed the umroh for all countries, even after several days closed also for own people."
"If I understand your question correctly, Sarwa, the self isolation applies to all travellers entering Australia from all destinations, residents and tourists."
"That is clear picture Baileybum, sometimes people only read from one source only and until nowadays there are more than 150 hoaxes in Indonesia about Covid-19.Pompom is also mentioned about self quarantine,All arrivals into Australia must self-isolate for 14 daysMar 15, 2020, 1:11 AMSaveNo matter where you are travelling from and includes Aussies. The government has just announced this and it kicks in tonight."
"Sarwa, is it a hoax that all schools in Jakarta and Bandung will stay closed at least for the next two weeks? And that all public parks, museums, sports stadiums etc will also remain closed? I also heard that Kota Tua area in Jakarta will be closed, and Ancol is already closed.You are local Indonesian and living near Jakarta and must know. Are these all hoaxes or are they real?"
"We must learn how to identify it is hoaxes or not. You may got the original source. If about Umroh you can check with the country sites or you can check with the ambassador in the certain country. You must also learn about Fallacies, most fallacy in TA are generalization.The governor of Jakarta and West Java have mentioned about closed - not lock down - of the schools for two weeks. Certainly it is not hoaxes, because I see their orations, original source. To close museums and also National Monument are also true. And the important thing, control your emotion, because with emotion you cannot thinking well."
".Edited: 4:03 am, March 15, 2020 "
"Did you go I am going in April and want to know what to,expect. Hope you are well"
"What Sarwa has failed to mention is that the Indonesian government pleaded with the Saudi's to be exempt from the umrah ban becuae Indonesia was covid-19 free. I agree, be aware of hoaxes, especially from the Indonesian government.Edited: 6:26 am, March 15, 2020 "
"And with only 96 cases or so of confirmed Coronavirus infection, since the government knows exactly where every one of those patients are, why is there a need to close schools and museums and public parks and mosques and churches aswell as parts of Jakarta for two weeks...? Perhaps just as a precaution? Or perhaps they have no idea how many people have got it and where they are, but enough to seriously concern them?Edited: 6:45 am, March 15, 2020 "
Sarwa G - you need to stop dribbling.
The FCO have just advised against all but essential travel to all of Indonesia.
"Related to number 227,Until nowadays, test of Covid-19 is done in Health Research and Development Body under Health Ministry in Jakarta, but since March 16, 2020 the test can be done also at Airlangga University, Surabaya and Eijkman Institution, Jakarta."
HiAny suggestion for those in Bali. My daughter is back packing with a return date in few weeks.Is it best advised to try and return back to the UK ASAPThey were in two minds but worried flights out would dry up.
Hi Mad - Foreign Office advice applies here and that's to contact the airline/travel agent and travel insurer for advice.https:/…travel-advice-novel-coronavirusThe airline will be best placed to advise on how this is affecting schedules.
Cheers matey
"Hi Janice . Have you made your trip as yet , we are also travelling via singapore to bali and leave on Wednesday ."
"There are 8 provinces from 34 provinces in Indonesia got Covid-19, Banten, DKI Jakarta, West Java, Central Java, DI Yogyakarta, Bali, West Kalimantan and North Sulawesi. So, all Java got Covid-19, except East Java. DKI Jakarta has the most number, from the latest data from additional new 17 Covid-19 patients, 14 are from Jakarta, and one each for Banten, West Java and Central Java. These is most active area in Indonesia. So, for outside Java including Bali do not panic.You may read,102. Re: Corona Virus Situation At BaliMar 15, 2020, 10:18 PM2 days before the match, the governor suggest, but maybe insist to cancel or do the match without soccer fans, the tickets have been sold out and the match day is Persib Anniversary, so the match is still happen with full of soccer fans with hand sanitizing at the entrance gate. In Bandung, only a few people use mask and also in Bekasi, in Jakarta is also no panicking. People know that possibility to get Covid-19 is less than get Dengeu Fever and Covid-19 is less dangerous than Bird Flu."
"Sarwa, you keep repeating the same information again and again.And, why repeat the information about a soccer match between two teams in Bandung? It is totally irrelevant here and in no way useful to the thread.And your advice ""for outside Java including Bali do not panic""....that would seem to mean those living in Java should panic? Great!"
"Panic and afraid maybe a little bit, even in Jakarta. There are no rush anymore. People follow government suggestion to reduce activities outside, the consequency, malls, department stores and supermarkets less visitors, so the tenants agree to open the shops in the malls initial at 11am, one hour later than usual and certainly the service charge will be lower. In Australia, Woolies supermarkets even open one hour advance to facilitate senior citizens and disabilities, because they cannot compete with other younger people in usual time. In Indonesia it is not necessary, because most of Indonesian family are extended family.When I go to supermarket there are limitation to buy maximum 3 kilograms granulated sugar cane, I see only one person buy it and only buy it, maybe he need to make coffee in his shack/warung. All stocks I think are adequate include antiseptic soap and alcohol 70 percent, but still lack of mask and hand sanitizer."
"The important fact the virus deniers continue to ignore is that Indonesia has only done around 1,100 tests. Of those 10% have been diagnosed as positive."
"After Singapore ban, Malaysia ban all foreigners to enter Malaysia and nation wide lock down is done from March 18 to 31, 2020. All Malaysian residents enter Malaysia have to self quarantine for 14 days.Indonesian President has mentioned that lock down is authority of Central Government. Until nowadays there are no Covid-19 in big island in Sumatra and Papua."
That is highly unlikely Sarwa. What you actually mean is officially there are no covid-19 cases in Sumatra.
"Yesterday morning a male came from Malaysia with temperature 36 degrees Celsius, but seems has dificulty to breath, so he are suspect of Covid-19 and got hospitalization and in the night he passed away. The patient has chronic kidney disease and the Covid-19 test is not yet finished.Previously all 5 passed away patients with Covid-19 have multiple chronic diseases each."
"What’s your point in post #263, Sarwa? Was this an Indonesian patient who contracted the virus in Malaysia?"
"The point is, if you have no chronic diseases you may still alive.Most common symptons are fever, fatique and dry cough, but the patient above has only 36 degrees Celsius, fortunately the officers saw he had difficulty to breath. Shortness of breath is also happen for some patients of Covid-19.From Malaysia means imported cases and the patient not go to anywhere, except Malaysia, if the test result of Covid-19 is positive, Indonesia must give data to Malaysia for tracing."
"So, what does that have to do with Bali, Sarwa?"
"Until nowadays, Bali has only imported case means detection, treatment and tracing in Bali is good, so no spread out from the patient to domestic people.Jakarta with high mobility has some domestic cases, so tracing in cluster and sub-cluster are very important, who are have close contact with patient, must be check one by one, maybe has Covid-19, but most of them are clean. It is hard to do, but it is better than lock down which lock down will ruin the economy, you can imagine for low income people without income for 2 weeks. South Korea do as Indonesia do and successful.I have monitored Bali since WTC attack, Bali Bombing I and II and Bali can survive. Because maybe there are no notice from their countries, so Bali economy move first from domestic tourists, Singaporean, Malaysian and China and as I know and remember Australian come later."
This is so tiring
"I hope this thread self destructs or changes the title to ""Ask Sarwa"". It's well past travel related ."
The virus deniers are in full force
"Maybe you can ask to Angela Merkel also,German Chancellor Angela Merkel said 70 percent of Germany’s population could become infected.Indonesia is also anticipate it, so Indonesia is making hospital for 1,000 patients in Galang Island. There are also possibility to change Atlethic Apartment to be as Covid-19 hospital and make the Sulianti Hospital as merely handle Covid-19.There are no one country in the world, if there are spike can handle all Covid-19 cases altogether, so experts nowadays talking about 'flatening the curve'."
Can the mods please ban Sarwa?
"Frankly, Sarwa, the Indonesian government is way behind In developing preparations in Bali which is the relevant concern for discussion on this forum."
Don’t worry as the world shuts down because Bali is the safest place to be apparently. By the way I have just managed to change my flight home to arrive in Brisbane on the 19th and my hotel has given me credit for my next trip for the balance of my stay. I will gladly reply with what is happening on the ground here as I read the next few posts. Richard.
"Sarwa, you post #272 has nothing to do with Bali.Also, can you please consider using Google Translate because honestly I have difficulty trying to understand half of what you are saying.And can I make a suggestion that you start your own thread about Corona virus news and information. You could call it ""Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Covid-19 (But Were Afraid To Ask)"".CheersEdited: 4:38 am, March 17, 2020 "

"Indonesia and South Korea certainly different, although both are not make lock down, please read number 268. Certainly Indonesia do harder than SK, because Indonesia is not rich as SK, but Indonesia is not developing country anymore.As per February 10, 2020, the US officially removed Indonesia and a number of other countries—including South Korea, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam—from the list of developing and least-developed countries.Maybe you do not understand about 'flattening the curve', so I will give example, if a country has capacity of 10,000 beds for handle Covid-19 and there are 20,000 patients of Covid-19 at the same time, so the country cannot handle it, and no one country in the world can overcome the situation like it. So must be flattening the curve means avoid break out from the beginning, so if the 20,000 patients are come gradually in 6 weeks, so the country can handle the Covid-19 patients.In google you can type 'flattening the curve',https:/…coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html"
Troll.
"Oh, I expect we all understand flattening the curve quite well, Sarwa. The question that concerns most people on this forum is what, exactly, is the national government doing anout it in Bali? Nepal is a very poor country yet has taken much more serious measures to address this. So, please, give us all a break and either post Bali specific information or set up your own blog."
"Certainly Bali has priority, so Bali has 4 Covid-19 hospitals, whereas West Java only has 8 Covid-19 hospitals for almost 50 million people, West Java is also 8 times larger than Bali."
"Covid-19 hospitals in Bali,RSUP Sanglah, Denpasar. Telepon: (0361) 227911-15 RSUD Sanjiwani, Gianyar. Telepon: (0361) 943049 RSU Tabanan Telepon: (0361) 811027, 819810, 811202 RSUD Kabupaten Buleleng, Singaraja. Telepon: (0362) 22046, 3307744"
"Ogoh2 parade can be done, although it is not a must. The parade is from 5pm to 7pm on March24, 2020 without viewers/tourists. But can the authority control there are no viewers/tourists to see ogoh2."
"Sarwa, thank you for the list of hospitals that can handle Covid-19 in Bali, that is useful."
"Yes, that is useful, but hopefully the local people can afford to be treated in those medical facilities. It won’t be needed for tourists, as most of them have been banned from international travel."
I think Sarwa has previously advised that the Indonesian government announced free medical services re Coronavirus.
"Hi,I’m not sure if that’s still the case, but despite his assurances that Indonesians were some how immune, Indonesia now has the dubious honour of having the highest number of deaths from the virus in SEA. Cheers"
"The news of indonesian being immune was about a monyh ago by some public figure who is clearly wrong,indomesian govt was very slow in.response to this virus.. and at first they were underestimating this virus by large scale..Now hospitals are clearly overwhelmed especially in jakarta..so 19 death are not a surprise really.. more is still to come in weeks,"
"Why overwhelmed,I suggest go directly to above hospital, number 284, if you have main symptoms, temperature same or above 38 degrees Celsius, DRY cough. You do not need endorsement from other hospital, if you have main symptoms as above. The problem is frequently people without endorsement go to these hospitals, because they afraid with Covid-19, although they have no close contact with positive Covid-19 patient and have no main symptoms, it make hospitals overwhelmed and moreover they said they have not got any test. Even though there are stages, in monitoring stage, without more severe symptoms, you will not get test of Covid-19, under supervision stage, you are suspect of Covid-19 and will be tested first with corona virus test and usually from 7 patients no one have corona virus and if the corona virus test is positive then test of Covid-19. So, from a thousand of patients, there are only less than a hundred will be tested of Covid-19.After additional from 3 hospitals to 8 hospitals in Jakarta, Sulianti Hospital is not open 24 hours anymore and only serve until 9pm, certainly emergency is still 24 hours.Private hospitals are also can handle Covid-19 patients, Mitra Keluarga, Bunda and Siloam asap. In Bali there are also Siloam Hospital too, but which one and can handle in monitoring stage, under supervision stage or even positive Covid-19 patients or only certain stages are not clear.At end of March hospital in Galang Island with concrete panels will ready to use, the capacity is 1,000 beds include 50 isolation rooms. This is to anticipate more Covid-19 patients which the curve is still hike."
"The problem with that is that many doctors are saying keep well away from hospitals and pharmacies because that is where you have a higher chance of picking up the virus. So anyone who worries they might have Covid-19 but doesn't may in fact catch it from a visit to a hospital.Pushing the buttons to call a lift or inside the lift, touching the desk at reception when registering at a hospital. It's things like this that are dangerous. The virus can live for up to 5 days on plastic, 4 days on glass, 2 days on steel, 2 - 8 hours on aluminium. And that's assuming everyone is wearing a mask."
"Jokowi, the president of Indonesia has admitted that they haven't been transparent about their Covid cases to avoid panic - https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/03/…Whilst I can see that panic is almost as bad as the virus, it means that we can't trust what is being reported (as is possibly the case for many countries). Also the preventative messages don't seem to be getting through - certainly up until yesterday, I saw very little evidence of any social distancing in Bali and I was still getting lots of massage invites. I think it would be very tricky to be a government in these times and I don't envy them the thin line they need to tread but I think we can safely assume, for our own safety, that what we're getting told isn't the full story and plan accordingly."
"There are several concerns,Hospitals, if the cases break a thousand number, hospital beds maybe are not sufficient, Athletic Villa/Apartment in Kemayoran, Jakarta has facility up to 1,800 beds. Until nowadays more than 50 percent cases are in Jakarta and only one in Bali.Medical persons, midwives and medical students at final level will help medical doctor.Financial, Finance Minister stated that Indonesia is ready for it.Logistics, 2 to 3 months before fasting month usually producer increase the production, there are a lot of biscuit, etc. and Indonesia is exporting biscuit to Europe and Africa, without export, the biscuit in Indonesia will abundant. And the most important thing, rice reserve is enough."
Sarwa you are floating in the clouds if you honestly believe there is only one case in Bali.
"The fasting month isn't really relevant in Bali, Sarwa, as you no doubt know it's Hindu, not Muslim. Please feel free to post useful information on what is actually happening - for instance that rapid testing will start taking place to accelerate detection and perhaps give us a more accurate idea of the actual numbers in Bali. https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/03/…"
"Sarwa, I am happy to know that Indonesia is increasing their biscuit production and exporting biscuits to Europe and Africa, and also that without exporting those biscuits that they will become abundant in Indonesia. But if there is a dire food shortage I really doubt that my family and I will be surviving on biscuits and I also doubt that hotels with tourists will be serving biscuits three times a day. Please get real.Edited: 3:22 am, March 19, 2020 "
"And just for a follow up to my last post, foods such as noodles, pasta, bread, tofu, potatoes and so on are good alternative to rice compared to biscuits..Edited: 3:43 am, March 19, 2020 "
"Indonesian consumption is move from rice to other carbohydrate food, so you can see more many bread shops and also more bread producers and there are also encourage by government for diversification, because importing rice is more difficult than importing wheat, although bread is still more expensive than rice, but the economy is increase, so many more people can buy bread, certainly not for main everyday meal.There are one person from Europe died suddenly on the street in Bali, and people think it is Covid-19 patient, before it advance check/test, a friend of him tell that he has chronic stomach disease and also hearth problem. If someone is positive Covid-19, Indonesia will test it for the second time with Genome Assay Test.Rapid Test is not so accurate, because it will test your blood for the immunoglobuline and it is only can detect after the patient has 7 days positive Covid-19 in the body. So you will missed the patient with 6 days positive Covid-19 in the body. So, cannot depends on the Rapid Test only, but this test can make the people happy, because they had the tested."
Dr Sarwa
"The issue of a potential rice shortage is not so relevant to tourists and more to do with the less affluent part of the Indonesian population. Therefore not really relevant here as we are more concerned with tourists, Incidentally, I buy bread and pay Rp16,000 for a large loaf of good quality sliced bread."

"I wasn't being serious, just a lighthearted comparison. I rather enjoyed his posts actually, can't understand why this one is still active though."
"I was at Bali Jaya mart in Kuta today opposite the morning market, it was about 10.00am so the market was basically closed apart from some street vendors,at least 14 black vans there and lots of officials standing around, I asked the question to my partner and she said they are Government , look at the number plate, then a lot of guys with bottles on their backs holding hoses came out, the market place was being disinfected. They quickly moved on to somewhere else."
"Related to number 299,Bali positive Covid-19 patient became 2 persons with one fatality to death.Rapid test will do at more sites with the priority who have contact with positive Covid-19. More easy to do, so all Indonesia can do it, the result can be got in several housr only. If the result is positive then must do the second test with throat DNA swab."
"The real problem here is that they are not testing enough people. It's pretty obvious that if they test many more people then the number of covid-19 infected people is probably going to skyrocket. Clearly, the more you test the more you are going to find.The suggestion made a week ago that Indonesia along with Singapore and Malaysia had a relatively low number of cases because they were better at handling the Coronavirus is totally wrong as far as Indonesia is concerned and very misleading."
"Absolutely, SuefingWild (post #311). This quote from Anne Barker, the ABC Indonesia correspondent bears out your point.“ Indonesia has done 1,727 tests for coronavirus in a population of about 270 million people. That would be the same ratio as if Australia had done only 160 tests - 160 in total - for the entire population of 25 million”."
"This is a very interesting item from ABC news yesterday, explaining how easily it is to spread this virus, with devastating results for all of SE Asia.https://tinyurl.com/sth9rwg"
"Further to Kevin’s post #313, the ordination of a Catholic Bishop in Flores went ahead with 1,000 attendees yesterday. It’s of some comfort that the Governor of Bali is attempting to manage risk factors within the limitations of his authority."
That pretty much drowns the theory from our resident 'expert' on here that the reason cases are so low in Bali (apparently) is the virus maynot survive in tropical weather. I think that just flew out the window.
"Yes, Dianne, I expect that the armchair epidemiologists might need to reconsider their previous opinions."
Good morning everyone. On Tuesday morning I was ordering my coffee at McDonald’s Kuta beach and the barista said Coronavirus won’t come to Bali. The reason is that they drink lots of Arak. Maybe the doc will confirm this as preventative medicine when he responds. Richard.
"Is the barista related to Donald Trump, Richard?"
Maybe Bb I think he was from Tanah Lot.
"Related to number 310, With coordination of Indonesian Trade Commerze and one of religion body, government will receive at least one million rapid test kit and others.This rapid test kit is from South Korea and has been successfully used in SK."
One million in a population of 270 million is a speck in the ocean.
"Sarwa, you're referring to your own posts. What is the plan for Bali, specifically? How many of these kits will Bali receive and is there any information on how the testing will be rolled out? What are your sources? Your information seems at odds with what the Jakarta Post is reporting, that the government is still working out how to get kits and distribute them and has no mention of what the plan is for Bali."
"Another question for you, Sarwa. There are reports that Indonesian hospitals will have to pay the government owned PT Rajawali Nusantara Indonesia for kits imported from China. Can Bali’s hospitals afford such costs? If not, what happens then?"

"Import by government certainly different from I mentioned in number 321.Certainly one million is not much, but not all must be tested. Government has made 'halodoc' application. I'm not install it yet, usually I install something in the midnight for better transfer rate. If you have installed and opened it, you can share it here."
#326 many people who are coming forward for testing are being turned away. Hence why the reported cases are basically non existent.
Thanks Snooky. So much for that supposed free treatment for foreigners. I hope your friend recovers soon.
I was always sceptical the free treatment would be for foreigners anyway.
Thanks Snooky. Are you able to tell us the age and health of this person.
"I think the most relevant part is that if you have no business being in Bali urgently at the present time, get out and don't risk clogging up their struggling healthcare/hospital system.I made that point in another thread but the usual self appointed forum Sheriff was sure to determine I couldn't give my opinion and had it removed. Too bad for them.I hope your friend makes a full and fast recovery, Snooky.Cheers"

In TA Forum with title Bali should I go home immediately to UK number 16 I have mentioned about Quinine Phospate and before it I have mentioned about it in TA Forum with the title Chloroquine Tablets In Bali number 1.Nowadays we cannot find anymore Chloroquine in the pharmacies. But Indonesia has ready with 3 million pills of Chloroquine which Indonesia is one of the producer and also want to import 2 million Avigan pills from Japan.Chloroquine has been used at least in 3 countries to inhibit Covid-19.

"Chloroquine Is being tested as a possible treatment, not being used as definitive solution. Quite what that has to do with Bali’s situation, I have no idea. Anyway, to get back on point - the Jakarta Post and other media are reporting that 3 new cases have now been diagnosed in Bali, including a doctor who worked in Sanglah Hospital. Not many to be sure but I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect this will eventually escalate."
"Indonesia is preparing 3 million pills of Chloroquine, but this pills is harmfull for kids.Totally there are 4 positive Covid-19 patients in Bali and one get fatality to death."
"Chloroquine production has nothing to do with Bali, Sarwa. Please stay on topic."
"Today in the AD newspaper, Dutch guy was hospitalise with high fever 2 months ago in Bali, he was traveling in Asia and back in the Netherlands the tests showed that he had the Coronavirus.Edited: 1:42 am, March 21, 2020 "
"He is lucky, if he got the positive Covid-19 2 months ago in Bali, so he is surviving for 2 months. But the virus has self limited life, usually after 2 weeks or 3 weeks, so I think he got the virus after Bali. Tracing is important."
"It has just been reported by an Australian foreign correspondent that a second foreigner, aged 72, has died from coronavirus in Bali. Apparently, this is one of the four cases earlier confirmed on the island. Despite passing away on “15th or 16th of March”, Bali’s taskforce is only revealing this news now, with no details yet on the person’s nationality ."
"He was in hospital in Bali and they didn't know what it was, now the tests showed that he had the virus.There must be so many cases like the rest of the world, even the parade is not canceled, they just don't get it there"
If the authorities were serious you will find thousands are currently infected. I arrived in Kuta March 12 and changed my return flight to March 19. During my stay many of the staff and some guests were constantly coughing and sneezing. The government should make available free testing and cover wages for the locals. The end result if left undiagnosed will result in many Balinese deaths that could have been prevented. Richard.
"Hi,CNN have just reported that an Indonesia woman was the second death in Singapore from covid-19. She had been in hospital in indonesia with pneumonia and travelled to Singapore where she died. Clearly there is a lack of testing in Indonesia. Cheers"
"The case number 4 is a woman with age 53 yo, she came from abroad with severe condition and got hospitalization, receive hearth treatment and also swab of Covid-19, and the test is positive, so it is imported cases and tracing in Bali has been done, but not so many persons have close contact with her, because she got directly hospitalization. Due to positive of Covid-19, so there are more treatments and she has diabetic, hypertension, hyperthyroid and lung problem.Based on the statistic in the world who get fatality to death almost all have more than one chronic diseases and less than one percent have no chronic disease at all."
"Sarwa please explain the reluctance to test. Every country is doing it. You are in Badung and there is a problem in solo. I don’t need google as I have indo friends that live in solo. You should get on citilink and go to Bali and see what is really happening. Don’t reply with flattening the curve BS as I am currently in 14 day isolation after returning from Bali yesterday. The fact is my many Balinese friends can’t understand why I have to stay in my room after I have left Bali. I explain it is a government rule. Their reply is better stay in Bali and you can go out anywhere,no problem. My rant is over and I don’t believe your response can justify my first hand experience. Richard."

"I’ve withdrawn my post #347 as I wrote the wrong gender. The second death, as reported in the Jakarta Post, was a 72 year old man. Why you’re repeating the details of the 53 year old British woman who was the first fatality, Sarwa, is beyond logic."
"Sarwa, just a little correction on your words, please google the meaning of ""hearth"" as I think you will find that it is a brick-lined fireplace. You've used that term often but I think you have the wrong word.Yes people are wondering why foreigners can have Covid-19 in Bali but the local Balinese have not one single case....it seems like a miracle."
Surfing wild I said on another thread that I was informed on Tuesday by a barista at McDonald’s Kuta the virus does not affect Balinese because they drink arak. Richard.
"Richard, many people maybe not smart as you are, you are in self quarantine, maybe because there are government rule, and you know what is the reason. A medical doctor got positive Covid-19 and he quarantine himself, although there are no rule for it previously, because he know about Covid-19.Bogor major go to Turkey and he is tested of Covid-19, the result is positive and he is in the quarantine. In the vlog he said it is necessary to be quarantined, although I only have a small cough.A group of local congress from a regent go to abroad and when back will be tested of Covid-19, but refuse it.I think Balinese are also must be educated of Covid-19, although there are advice from the Balinese elderly people when there are sick season you must stay in your home, but maybe Balinese are not yet feel nowadays is a sick season.Indonesia has many cultures, if you still do not understand the Balinese, you may visit other area of Indonesia, so you can understand, why they and why they not. You cannot make a generalization for all of Indonesia with more than 700 hundred tribes."
Thank you surfing wild it must be heart.
"Yes Sarwa it's heart. You are most welcome.Yes Richard I saw your post yesterday.And I am not sure that I agree with Sarwa that the reason that the Balinese do not have a single case of Covid-19 is because they feel it is not the sick season yet. I find that unbelievable and frankly a bit ridiculous. Obviously if a Balinese is sick he or she is not going to wait until the ""sick season"" before seeking treatment.Edited: 4:16 am, March 21, 2020 "
It's not the sick season in Australia either.

"So, the lack of effective testing is no longer due to a non existent “sick season” but, instead, it’s due to alleged religious fanaticism, based on the behaviour of some Muslim adherents on a totally different Indonesian island?The fact remains that the national government is woefully unprepared for the spread of this virus. It has, to date, failed to ensure enough testing kits for its population, has still not established a timely means of establishing results of tests undertaken in Bali and is scrambling to catch up with many of its SE Asian neighbours."
"Hi,There is something quite shocking about the 72 year of Frenchman who became the second covid-19 death in Bali. I’m sure some of the details will emerge but again the initial information about the death were wholly misleading. Cheers"
"Sarwa, according to you you are a pretty much self confessed know all about all.You spend so much time devoted to an English speaking forum (which you are not good at by the way), I wonder where your experience comes from.The topic is bali corona virus update and all I have heard from you is googled information about anything but the topic.At the risk of getting my post deleted, Sarwa it is time to pull your head in and take a break.You have tried to dominate this virus topic for far too long."
"Like button, Lynne, it's like ground hog day."
"Lynne, you are saying what I suspect 99% of readers and posters here think. The problem is Sarwa cannot see that he is the problem and that it would benefit this forum if he just took a long break. His long and persistent ramblings just confuse the issues and make hoping to find some relevant and helpful advice here impossible. It gives me a headache seeing his posts.Can't the administration do anything about this?"

"Hi,Some hopefully useful info that I don’t think has appeared yet on this thread as it started properly today, 21/3. Starting today, Sanglah Hospital Is holding mass rapid test. For people who want to test, they can come at 8am - 4pm.. It’s open every day except Nyepi - 25th.

One death today in Bali for virus. I think this is the tip of the spread.
"Hi,Actually the death was last Sunday unless this is another one. They have just revealed that post mortem results showed the person was a positive case of covid-19. Cheers"
"Finally, tradition of ogoh2 is prohibited by Bali Governor, but ritual of melasti, tawur kasanga and pangrupukan can be done with maximum 25 persons.Tradition and ritual is different."
"Stay on topic, Sarwa. You might want to add this comment to my earlier post about the Ogoh Ogoh parade as an update, I think it would be better in there."
"Sarwa, please take note that your contributions to this forum are not appreciated. Please do us all a favour and go away."
"Soon, Sanglah hospital will has laboratorium for swab testing, so do not need anymore to send the sample to Jakarta or Surabaya, whereas Udayana Army Hospital will do rapid test, all experts to both hospitals are on the training.Rapid test is only for on the under supervision stage and not for in monitoring stage, who get the positive result of rapid test will do swab test.Monitoring stage and under supervision stage can be read at, 115. Re: Bali Corona Virus update?https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29422…"
"Priority is for patients in under supervision stage, if have more rapid test, so the rapid test is also used for who in monitoring stage.In Jakarta priority is for South Jakarta with most suspects and then to other area in Jakarta. In Bali 96 patients are under supervision, 73 patients have been do swab test with the negative result is 70 patients."
Weeks have passed since Jokowi finally admitted to the positive COVID-19 infections and there's still no lab in Bali capable of processing the samples. They're still working out the logistics?? It's like a sick joke!!.
"Logistics and equipment are sadly lacking, Fresh Prince. Singapore had to send Personal Protection gear and ventilators to Batam last week. This doesn’t augur well for Bali when the outbreak comes."
Meanwhile patients (who are not local) in designated hospitals in Bali in isolation being 'treated' for corona virus are being kept in the dark!! they are not given results of their tests and not being told the cost of their hospital stay and treatment costs. Disgraceful!
"Snooky, I'm guessing that your information is directly from someone who is in hospital in Bali?Does anyone else have any additional information on what's happening on the ground in Bali as well?"
Are you still in Ubud Janice?
#375 yes first hand information which once again the self appointed TA zapping committee have deemed it necessary to report my post. Seriously stop.
"Snooky 100% agree this is important information we need from people on the ground in Bali as many of us are concerned for people stuck or living there.Edited: 8:51 pm, March 22, 2020 "
To the people who keep reporting posts everyone knows who you are. If information does not meet guidelines then TA moderators make the decision to remove such posts. Those who insist on reporting unnecessarily and attempting to delete posts for their own personal purposes should stop as people want to receive correct information.
I wholeheartedly agree with Snooky. Go play childish games elsewhere. Deletion requests should only apply to posts that are abusive or plainly stupid at this point of time. We can bypass information that isn’t helpful or debate false information but don’t delete posts that address issues such as hospital/ health facilities. Be a responsible adult.
"So Snooky, were you saying that a person you've communicated directly with, who is in hospital in Bali with COVID-19, is not receiving information on their health status nor any information on their costs? Are they able to contact the Australian Embassy for help?"
I also agree with Snooky. Please stop reporting important posts just to gain some self gratification by trying to get back at someone. We all know who you are. Stop this childish behaviour and be united and supportive in these hard times .

#390. Thank you for posting. The post of mine earlier that was removed by the self appointed forum police was giving an example of how there is a cover up and that there is underreporting and testing and those who are tested are being denied results. Perhaps now those who see fit to continually report information that is true and informative will stop doing so .IF valid honest information is left on the forum it will benefit people who either don't realise or choose to remain in Bali holidaying. There is a real danger there just like many places in the world but truthful information is vital. No one wants to stay somewhere that cannot cope with this situation.
"Scary stuff BB but should come as little surprise to many of us who could see the wood from the trees early on. If Indonesia had been transparent & honest about the situation, there would have been no Australian or overseas tourist visiting Bali for at least the past month!! This was calculated and shows that $$$ comes before safety in some corners of the globe. Indonesian propaganda & cover ups. It worked. I lost count of the numerous ""You have a better chance of catching it in OZ' type comments, that I saw from Australians trying to justify why they should not cancel.It doesn't look good for Indonesia. As usual, salt of the earth type folk will pay the price for incompetency and lies, not those in power and making the decisions. There will be an ICU bed available for them should they need it. Rest assured."
"News just in:Imagine how many people he treated.......  ""A Medical Resident studying to become a specialist doctor contracted the novel coronavirus while on assignment at Bali’s Sanglah General Hospital between 2 - 15 March 2020.The infection was confirmed by the head of Bali’s Health Department, Dr. Ketut Suarjaya.The unnamed resident (senior medical student) is now hospitalized undergoing treatment at the Dr. Soetomo General Hospital in Surabaya, East Java.The Doctor has been confirmed as infected with COVID-19.Health officials in Bali are now retracing the movements and contacts of the Resident during his 13-day assignment in Bali.""This article is able to be shared."

"Interesting that some of the most articulate and vociferous supporters of Indonesia's safety posted only half a dozen times on this forum, if not the rest of TA. One wonders if Indonesias initial response to the virus i.e. paying social media influencers to post positive stories about traveling to Indonesia, seeped into TA.I fear for all of Indonesia, as it is about to get a lot worse. I had better shut up now, as I might get accused of working in the travel industry."
Thanks to all especially Snooky for the info. I have friends in Kuta and they are scared to the bone with what they are told but get no news from local info.I do know that most by now will not have a job and the future is very uncertain for them. I just wished I had got my friends back to Australia before all this went pear shape.

"Indonesia now has a 9.3 per cent death rate from coronavirus — the highest in the world — after the death toll rose by a quarter at the weekend, to 48 out of a total of 514 confirmed cases.Quote from a news article. As I alluded to on my post # 7 way back on Feb 19 and a few more along the way. I am really sorry if people were ignorant to this and many others comments too and now find themselves in a predicament.Hopefully, Sarwa will shut up for good now, because like we said, he has been wrong all along. I just hope no one was stupid enough to pay any attention."
"Yes it is very sad. This reported high death rate is most likely an indication that in fact the real death rate is probably about the same as everywhere else and a lot more people are infected than reported. As many Balinese do not go anywhere near a doctor their entire lives, the rate of infection is probably even higher especially as the Balinese live closely packed together. This is clearly a world wide problem, but I do think it will hit the Balinese harder than in many other places. Keep safe everyoneEdited: 6:01 pm, March 23, 2020 "

How did they test it?
"Certainly using laboratory, use reagant to test the sample. All laboratory persons can do it, after training and they have been trained yet. This test is only for in observation patients, because it is expensive test. For illustration, from 100 patients in monitoring stage, there are only 10 patients in observation stage and only maybe one or two or maybe nil of Covid-19.Many people want test of Covid-19, but it is impossible. Even South Korea not test all its people with Covid-19 test."
Clear as mud. Thanks
Of course the testing will only commence after Nyepi. What's another day given how sloth like the authorities have acted to date?Clearly they have their priorities straight.
"Even if they do have testing available in Bali (which is what I interpret Sarwa's somewhat obtuse post to mean), there seems little point if people aren't isolating and social distancing, nor if they don't have access to hospital care even if they do have it. I can understand the challenge though - how practical is it to expect people to stay home and earn no money when there's a chance of getting something and putting food on the table? Objectively we will see the impact that the differing approaches have - isolation and economic hardship in the Western countries and herd immunity and high death toll in Indonesia. Unobjectively it's heartbreaking to think of the thousands who will die."
Quite correct. Thousands will die owing to their governments incompetence and lax attitude.

Cannot Sarwa be put on hold? His comments are totally wrong and of no use. Just spreading falsehoods.
"People just have to be very careful of what the media report on confirmed cases (Western and Indonesian) The stats are not correct. Numbers of confirmed Covid-19 in indonesia will never be known, same as Australia. People are dying from from a wide range of issues and are being reported as having Covid - 19, which is not confirmed and is only a guess.The sooner we let this virus burn out , the better. All in all Indonesians are 10x better at washing and keeping clean compared to westerners."
"What size tin foil hat do you wear, bungale?Edited: 7:39 am, March 25, 2020 "

Heartbreaking.
"I don't understand . My hat size has nothing to do with covid-19.Tests have already been produced to test for traces of the antibodies in peoples blood. The current test that checks for the active virus was rushed through production. Testing proves nothing at the end of the day because results are not found until 2 weeks after the patient had been contagious. by the time results are in 98% of patients have recovered and are not contagious. All governments actions are two weeks late in every instance . This is simple virus logic . There has never been cures for the 50 other virus's the human race has , apart from trying to prevent contact in the first place. Anybody with kids would know that a healthy person receives at lest 3 virus' s each year, most go unnoticed and the older you get the less it affects you."
Sad to watch Snooky. I was in Yogyakarta just before Christmas and have never been anywhere so crowded. I imagine most of Java is the same. This virus will run rampant in Indonesia and scenes like that will sadly become more common. How long until they kick out the foreign media?
"Number 421,Most of Indonesian take a bath twice a day, certainly use soap, it cannot be done in country with winter time."
"Number 414,The priority is as number 412 and then migrant worker who come back from cruise ships to cut imported cases, and then who work in hospitals mainly who handle directly Covid-19 patients, receptionists and cleaning services have no direct contact with Covid-19 patients, so it is in the last priority. It is swab test for Covid-19 and certainly different with Rapid Test."

Hi Ginny I hope you are the pied piper and playing the flute loud and hard! But I think some people are deaf.i hope not! Richard.
"Bravo, Ginny. He obviously wants to participate but it's just not coming across all that successfully."
"Soap or without soap is different. The Covid-19 virus has 'skin' of fat and soap will destruct the skin, so the virus has no protection anymore. Not only soap, everything can decipher fat can be used to protect you from the virus."
"Sarwa G,Are you reading any of the responses from other members of this forum.?????They are asking you to 'stop' posting.Please, please stop."
"Give it a rest, Sarwa. I’m sure our respective governments are quite capable of issuing washing advice."
"Why was my post in Bahasa indonesia asking Sarwa to use Google Translate before posting and to stop saying stuff such as people in cold climates can't adequately wash . taken down??? HE IS DRIVING ALL OF US INSANE!!! He doesn't seem to understand English and certainly can't write in English. I thought if I took the trouble to say this pretty politely in Bahasa Indonesia he might understand. My post has been taken down and Sarwa G is BACK with more barely understandable garbled comments about corona virus. Can't someone STOP HIM!!!Edited: 5:00 am, March 26, 2020 "
"i think we all have to just stop trying to stop him, its futile. Unfortunately Sarwa has made himself irrelevant many, many posts ago. Just pretend he is not there."
"I think it's become a bit of reversed psychology, the more complaints the more kicks Sarwa gets out of posting. Perhaps if no one responds whatsoever as if the posts are invisible he might give up, wishful thinking I know."
"Hi,It’s hard to remember what this thread is about sometimes, but to those of you who are maybe still stuck in Bali and may not have heard this latest news from the governor. The closures For Nyepi that were extended to today the 26th, have now Today been extended until Monday the 30th. The order is to stay at home and this will be policed. Exemptions are for food shopping and for medical supplies etc. Cheers"
"This is in reply to Post 429... Virus are the most common form of illness in humans. We build up antibodies to most of them while we are still very young due you high probability of catching in daycare and school yard. just to list a couple of common Virus:BronchiolitisChickenpoxGastroenteritisHand, foot and mouth diseaseRoseola infantumSlapped cheek or fifth diseaseMeningococcal infection Some of these still kill children yearly by do not affect older people because if antibodies and vaccines to 90% of the world received when they younger. Covid- 19 is a mutated form of Corona Virus . Corona virus it self is harmless and has been around for close to 60 years in many forms. At present Covid - 19 is treated the same a HIV and pneumonia because it attacks identical areas of the body."
"Getting back to the main subject. Its too hard to know the true impact of the virus in indonesia at the moment. But I can bet my house on it that USA america will come out the worst in the world , health care in america is worse then indonesia.Trump is saying alot and doing nothing Widodo is doing alot and saying nothing"
Bungale and Sarwa will stop when they catch coronavirus.
"Hi,There were 103 new (identified) cases today in Indonesia and a further 20 deaths, mostly in the hotspot of the Jakarta. Meanwhile 20+ flights landed in Bali from Jakarta today. This doesn’t inspire confidence. Cheers"
"One of the survey stated that Indonesian are more optimistic than the other. So you must be optimistic and do not hate the other LeeLou. Balinese has also optimism and always attempted in the center, so I think is like confucianism. Immunologist says that optimism is important for immunity.I have mentioned before that USA handled incorrectly of Covid-19 and nowadays some experts said that USA can be a new epicenter of Covid-19.When Yogyakarta get earthquake, there are foreign volunteers that also help in New Orleans hurricane and they said Indonesia do better, because Indonesia has 'gotong royong' - you can search it in Google, but the meaning is more than it.In USA there are also panic buying of gun and bullet, because they afraid of unrest happen, so logistic is important and I have also mentioned about it."
This is not looking goodhttps:/…155241464c102d00dd7e325bada0c393
Sarwa you told us some weeks ago that the reason Indonesia has very few Covid-19 cases is because Indonesia like Singapore and Malaysia handled the situation better than other countries. It seems you were telling us wring information. Do you still believe it?
Sarwa read link in post 452
Dianne that is very scary.
"Another gloomy report:https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/co…Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand have all closed borders to visitors, for a reason. The Covid epicenters have shifted to Europe and US. Imported cases are the concern, even for China. When I last checked my Flightradar24 app, flights are still arriving into DPS from Amsterdam, Moscow, Vienna, among others."
SurfingWild could be very tragic
"Somehow, I don’t think optimism is the prevailing feeling in Indonesia right now."
"Unfortunately Sarwa has been pedalling untruths for months. His only supporters have been first time posters who are most likely to be paid social influencers who post 2 or 3 times then disappear.The positive in this, is the world has recognised that Indonesia is likely to be the next epicentre of covid-19 and there is no one on this forum who believes him anymore.. Let him post his fairytales, and the rest of us can stick to the factsEdited: 7:59 am, March 27, 2020 "
"Indonesia only has 2 intensive care unit beds per 100,000 people, the lowest proportion in Asia.https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/03/…"
"I feel so sad and helpless, so many of the lovely people I have come to know and now call friends are in such a bad situation. My thoughts and prayers go to Bali and the rest of the world."
"Hi Bailey, I would guess that it's less than that even. I wonder if people know that Joko Widowo's mother has died. I haven't read it in the press, Only spotted in an Instagram. Corona?"
"Related to number 451.On Friday March 27, 2020 positive Covid-19 in USA is more than 85,000, whereas in China is more than 81,000 and in Italy more than 80,000. So, USA definitely is new epicenter of Covid-19."
"Joko Widowo's mother has died, because of 4 years of cancer."
"^ The US has a high infection rate because they have a very high test rate and their reporting is accurate.The same cannot be said for Indonesia no matter how hard you try to spin your rubbish. Indonesia has literally tested no one in comparison. You have a similar sized population. Your government were slow to act and tried to look the other way hoping Allah would solve the problem.When Indonesia have conducted as many tests as US, come back and let us know but until then stop with your propaganda."
"Good Morning, Ripley. Sujiatmi Notomiharjo had throat cancer for the last 4 years. Cheers"
I’m starting to think Sarwa is a descendant of Tokyo Rose.
"Sarwa have you actually read the links in #452, 456 & 460 ."
"To number 466, related to number 464.You must read first number 195.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29422…"
"Sarwa 452, 456 & 460!!"
"Sarwa, you need to read #197 which I completely agree with and 2 weeks later on has been found to be correct. You managed to avoid the most important part of my comment comparing the number of people tested and you intentionally steered to topic towards the type of test being conducted, which I didn't even raise!!!Edited: 5:10 pm, March 27, 2020 "
"In number 195, when I know USA do only one test, I have already think it is dangerous, because there are Positive False and Negative False. And the carrier can make infection to the others and with his/her mobility can infect in vast area, without know who is the carrier. Indonesia ensure it is positive or not first and if positive will tracing to close contact. It is hard worker and time consume, if the positive Covid-19 has high mobility and many close contact.So, you can read,so, for release someone from quarantine need 2 negative pcr to avoid negative false. negative false is more dangerous than positive false.The complete post is in number 166.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29422…"
Conclusion - Sarwa is a spam bot. He/she/it doesn't respond with any emotion and randomly assembles words interspersed with links and references to past posts. I have appealed to him/her/it privately and got nowhere so perhaps consider reporting his/her/it's posts as spam from now on.
Sarwa are you avoiding my question in post 471 for any reason ?
"If you have access to administator, you can read first number 473."
"Indonesia reported 109 new cases of coronavirus on Saturday. Total cases have risen to 1155 - up from 0 cases as recently as March 2. Also, there were 15 more deaths which takes the total to 102. That’s the highest death toll in south-east Asia.Indonesia, particularly Bali, still doesn’t have enough test kits for its population. As access to testing improves, I think it’s safe to say that these numbers will obviously increase dramatically. If you don’t test, you don’t know."
From NSW Health: Seven cases have been confirmed from a wedding in Bali on 21 March.https:/…20200327_00.aspx
"From 3400 positive Covid-19 in Australia, 67 percent are linked to travel, but we do not know how many of percentage portion go to Bali, because there are many Australian go to other countries besides Bali and nowadays some of them stranded in India and fear of running out of food and water.More over Ruby Princess cruise ship cases without mass testing is same or worse than a cruise ship in USA and nowadays USA has number one of positive Covid-19 patients.https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/l…Previously, After a cruise ship cannot disembark in Semarang and Surabaya, the cruise ship can disembark in Benoa, Bali, after the passengers has been tested, but we do not know what kind of the test, but not all passengers disembark and still stay in the ship. So, there are possiibility same case as in USA and Australia happen in Bali, but until nowadays in Bali after several days the number is still same with 9 positive Covid-19 patients."
"BB that certainly seems to show that it's getting around but to balance that, I left Bali on 18th March and I've had a test which was negative (husband didn't have test but on day 10 of our quarantine he's not showing any symptoms). Of course it may just have been that I wasn't doing any mwah mwah and avoided body massages for the last 5 days or so.This is the first cases I've read of that have been traced back to Bali - has anyone else heard of someone who got it there?"
"I was surprised to see this, Mel, as it hasn’t had any coverage in the media that I know of. Mind you, there are some rather serious issues being reported now so it would likely just be a blip on the media radar right now."
They'll dig it out if there's a lull in covid stories.

Hilarious the many threads where people were chastised for being concerned about traveling this spring.
"Almost 254,000 foreign tourists left Bali between I-26 March. Then again, more than 169,000 foreign tourists arrived on the island. Travellers from Australia, Russia & the United States topped the list of visitors, according to a government official. Unbelievable.https:/…"
"Hi,Also explains why some people found it hard/impossible to find a seat on a departing flight. Cheers"
Are these people nuts??
"Hi,9 new cases identified in Bali today. Gilimanuk to java ferry limited to Indonesian ID card holders only. Cheers"
"Where are you getting the info from, paulosussex? Not disrespecting you, just curious as most of the news locations I see are for Indonesia as a whole."
Beaches closed too https:/…
"Hi MelMMMM,Balipost, Balitribun, Kompas, https:/…covid19Etc.Cheers"
"Thanks, I'll keep an eye on them."
Another Australian has been diagnosed with coronavirus after returning home from Bali.https:/…2020-04-02-two-nt-women-diagnosed
"Not that there was any doubt, but it's definitely getting around. Our quarantine lifted this morning (we came back on the 19th) and we don't have it so maybe it wasn't too widespread. Or it might have been because we were careful in the airport and stayed most of the time in the Garuda lounge."
They let 300 Indonesian citizens that worked on an Italian cruise ship into Bali Airport and said no one had the virus because they all were temperature tested at the airport. Oh boy watch this space.
"After seeing how many people weren't social distancing at the supermarket in Sydney, I think it'll be a race to see who gets the most cases. 1.5 metres seems to be a pretty difficult concept for some people to grasp."
"This isn't about Bali, but interesting news nevertheless. They started drive-thru testing for the Covid-19 virus in West Java yesterday and already detected about 600 confirmed cases with 300 or so in Sukabumi and around 200 in Bandung. That's a big number for one day, so heave knows what the true number must be across Indonesia for those who have not been tested."
That and the pastor and his wife of a church in Bandung died and 226 out of 600 of the congregation have tested positive for Covid-19. So many people in this country really are not taking this seriously.
"Sadly, it all comes down to “if you don’t test, you don’t know “."
"Hi people just checking back in after 14 day compulsory self isolation. After calling Sarwa out 1 month ago I see all all of my predictions ring true. I am in constant contact with all of my Balinese friends and sadly they don’t get it. I am scared that when I return I will have families that are missing a parent or parents. Maybe a child or the entire family is deceased. I pray daily for my friends of 20 plus years but as most of you know the resilience and religion will overcome all issues,I hope this is true. May God bless you all and stay safe. Richard."
"Glad your 14 days are up Richard. There's pretty dire news coming out of Indonesia these days and sadly fear there's a lot worse to come, very scary."
Thanks Dianne. I just wish that they can supply enough test kits to get the real numbers.
"Hi,This was posted on a local expat page. It’s obviously not vigorously statistically proven but probably not far from the truth. “An often made comment related to the spread or impact of Covid-19 in Indonesia is that there’s not more people dying. Well, in Jakarta the number of funerals in March has increased a whopping 40%...On a side note, of ALL conducted Covid-19 tests in Indonesia more than 25% was positive. Draw your own conclusions...”Cheers"
"Some further information re your post #507, Paul.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…"
If Sarwa doesn't have egg on face yet he should have.
That's so comical isn't it.
Indonesia has one of the lowest testing % per population in the world.It seems that there will be a tragedy of epic proportions about to unfold.
I tried to
I don’t think it’s right to gloat about Sarwa being proven wrong. He is as much a victim of his government’s propaganda and inaction as every other Indonesian. I wish the best of luck and the best of health to him and his.
"Oh that's hilarious about Sarwa. I wonder if he knows he is now becoming a source of comic relief! Somehow I doubt it! He'll eventually be deleted so many times on the Australia forum as well that he will move onto another one. Let's see where he goes next! The guy may be a victim of propaganda but .....Edited: 9:10 am, April 04, 2020 "
"I love Bali. But thanks to the Indonesian govt's ineptitude in handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, the earliest i believe, i could visit my paradise again is in 2022.Sarwa is an Indonesian govt's planted spam bot. Let's not waste our time on this bot.Edited: 9:13 am, April 04, 2020 "
"Number 501,300 positive is tested by Rapid test in police academy dormitory.Learn first about specificity and sensitivity, if you cannot ask your medical doctor, you can learn from wikipedia, I think there are no propaganda there.If all have positive test of swab Covid-19 test, it is a big single cluster, but not yet spread out. It is different with Ruby Princess cruise ship which has more than 650 positive of Covid-19 in entire continent and more than a half is outside of the origin area.I hope you have more informations, 24/7, than me. Many Indonesian live in Perth, Melbourne and Sydney. Informations can come from everywhere."
"Sarwa, how much are/were your government paying certain individuals to spread propaganda on how well Indonesia has dealt with this pandemic? Not a trick question as this has been widely reported, except for the pay rate. Hoping you can fill in the blank."
"Given the Indonesian government’s continual flip flopping over issues such as Munduk, you’re sadly going to see a massive escalation of infections, Sarwa. It remains that there are not enough test kits, of any type, available for 270 million people so the spread of the virus will continue unabated."
"Just watching news articles ,which I might add stretch the truth at times ,I feel so sorry for people in Bali as they are not being told certain important information on this virus. I have friends who only find out how bad this is by contacting me. Lots of Indonesians are very scared and the other lot have absolutely no idea how bad this has got and will get worse soon."
"Yep, all his posts have now been deleted from the Australia forum although some of the replies are still there which are quite inventive.HaveYouEatenYet, it's commendable what you said and yes, it's not nice that Sarwa was proved wrong through the Balinese and Indonesian suffering, but he hasn't made any effort to mediate his posts, either in improving his language, cutting back on the propaganda or posting more relevant stuff. I assume that, like me, other people have PMed him as well without any change so I think people's frustration is showing."
The Balinese and other Indonesians haven’t a hope when their central government contains a jackass like this Minister https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/04/…
"I also seriously doubt that it's going to make much difference. I tihnk the biggest threat to Indonesia now is Mudik since the government has not banned it. I know lots of Muslim friends who believe that Mudik should be banned this year. However, enforcing it is something else. I can just imagine with so many Indonesians who work in Jakarta returning to their home towns and villages throughout the country, how the virus could spread."
"A 65 year old foreigner has reportedly died from Coronavirus in Bali. https:/…Unfortunately, the news article linked to in the tweet is in Indonesian."
"Just read your thread Baily, yes this guy is dreaming. He has the same idea as my neighbours kids ,that we are all going over the top with this and there is nothing to worry about. Oh boy a lot of people are living in a glass house."
"On April 5, 2020, Bali has 38 positive confirmation of Covid-19, 18 is get well/recovery, after 2 negative tests and 2 got fatality to death with at least with 2 others chronic degenerative diseases.Recovery rate in Bali is more than 50 percent, the best in Indonesia.No one pay me, I only give facts/data, because no one can beat the facts/data."
"Sorry, almost 50 percent."
Indonesia has been taking this so seriously that they've managed to conduct just 36 tests per million population. Then the propagandists among us try to describe the low case rates and how Indonesia are on top of their game regarding the virus when the rest of us know that nothing could be further from the truth.
"I'm sure Sarwa will find a way to justify the substantial increase in the number of funerals in March and let me predict, it will be put down to sheer coincidence and will have nothing to do with any virus. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…Edited: 3:51 pm, April 05, 2020 "
"Bali has a population around 4.3 million people. That just 38 people have tested positive simply indicates that not enough testing has been undertaken to date. Time to start citing your sources, Sarwa."
"Hi,The Jakarta governors directive that all citizens should wear masks when going out has now been extended to Bali. I am confused about the figures being quoted. I counted 3 deaths in Bali, a british tourist, a French tourist and lastly an American in Kuta, but I guess we will have to wait a week to discover whether it was C-19 or some other condition. Cheers"

"Covid 19 fight in indonesia is very bad.., so little test, untransparentngoverment, long result time, unaccurate rapid test , slow govt response , mudik is not prohibited. Its all fact, and the official count is just a camouflage ... i really hope bali is spared from this virus.. otherwise economy can become disaster in years."
"Indonesia is still test until finish, however the patient of Covid-19 get fatality to death, before the test result is not yet finish. It is important for tracing.However, the corpse will use kafan/shroud and then use waterproof plastic to cover it, disinfectant, before get into the coffin and then disinfectant again, after the coffin is closed. All persons do this use hazmat suit and also the driver and who buried it.In Makassar there are family want to buried by their self, but based on previous experience, they open the coffin and open also the plastic, even they kiss the corpse.In Banyumas, the ambulance must turn back to the hospital, because people do not want use the funeral. Even if use government land, they refuse it.Finally, use government forest land far from the people as a funeral.Medan and Palembang make funeral special for Covid-19.No matter in Bali, because they will take the corpse later for ngaben.There are possibility spike of positive Covid-19 patients from migrant workers in Bali, mainly from the crew of cruise ships, if they come back by themselves, but if they are evacuated by government they will do 14-day quarantine in inhabitant Sebaru Kecil Islet. And I have posted it at number 166."
"Sarwa, fatality always means death when talking about people. You don't need to say ""fatality to death"", just say the patient ""died""."
"No point saying anything to Sarwa - He never listens anyway and clearly he has no interest in using Google Translate to make sure his English makes any sense at all. Think he is swapping between forums telling the world what to do Englonesian.. Might as well just accept him as entertainment.Edited: 2:07 am, April 06, 2020 "
"Qures Y, it's refreshing to have a local being willing to call things out for what they are and countering blatant propaganda.Amazing how Sarwa's view is so diametrically opposed to everyone else on this forum regarding Indonesia's handling of this pandemic. Yet he persists."
"Like the bloke that's had too much to drink and now finds themselves offending rational peoples sensibilities, maybe it's time he was escorted down the stairs and shown the door for the repeat offending?"
"I'm reporting all his posts as spam, in the hopes that the bouncers will escort him off the premises."
On a serious note my friend in Bali just called to say that Grandma has just passed away. She has always been fit and healthy and they can’t understand why she just died. I can’t reply other than to say my condolences. Richard.
Haven't bothered looking at this thread for about 300 posts and nothing has changed...Sarwa in denial and defending the undefendable.... lol
"Sorry to hear that Richard, very sad."
Thanks Dianne. It is extremely difficult trying to explain what they are in for especially when trying to also explain why I left early from my holiday. I wish that the Indonesian government along with the Balinese governors would explain to their citizens how serious this is.
An almost impossible task probably. A lot of deaths put down to something else will be the norm I'm anticipating.
True!
"Sarwa is on another planet, just scroll on past the nonsense."
"Sarwa is now posting his drivel on the US forums, hoping that they will be more open to his dangerous trivia. Unfortunately for Sarwa they are about as receptive to his posts as we are in the Indonesian forums."
"Given Indonesia is testing just 29 people out of every million, it’s unsurprising that the caseload of positive test outcomes and deaths are so low and unrepresentative of the reality of this virus’ impact.https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing"
"Thanks Calla. Given the bluntness of some of the US forum members I’ve seen, this could be interesting."
"Disclaimer: following post is my opinion and is not the opinion of the masses.The most important thing we must be doing is to take precautions, don’t travel , don’t meet anyone not living with you and cook all food through.I feel the testing should only be for high risk individuals. If we are taking the isolation precautions then there is no risk of us infecting anyone else. Living in Indonesia through much of the recent virus you learn to take these precautions quite serious.#iamnotatrollEdited: 7:51 am, April 06, 2020 "
"God bless you guys, I don't know why you continue to battle Sarwa. It is clear that he doesn't know what he is talking about and he is on some type of misinformed campaign.Sarwa says that Wikipedia is a credible source. That's everything that you need to know right there. It's actually comical. You guys just need to keep your stress levels down as to keep your immune system up to stave off this virus. Stay safe, healthy, and well.  My Bali July 2020 trip will be postponed until July 2021. I'm getting daily updates from U.S. State Department/U.S. Embassy in Jakarta that tells me that things are looking very bleak in Indonesia. Today's email was actually more alarming than previous emails.The U.S. govt is urging Americans to come home now while they have a chance. I think the chance is already small as it is. Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong isn't letting non-citizens through. These are where most of the connecting flights from Bali to the U.S. would happen. Also in bold print - ""The U.S. govt doesn't anticipate arranging repatriation flights from Indonesia at this time"".Seeing the very late response that Indonesia has taken with all the denials, I fear that this virus is going to hit them like a ton of bricks with many fatalities. Very sad. Not that the U.S. response was any better. We definitely have a leader that doesn't lead and is completely inept. However, the U.S. has the money, resources, and a better health care system vs Indonesia."
"Hi,7 new cases identified in Bali today bringing the total to 43. Cheers"
But how many people are being tested? 43 cases surely that is not an accurate figure. Look at what is happening all around the world. I feel very sad and concerned for the people of Indonesia as I do for every country battling this terrible virus. I wish everyone well . Hopefully we will all get through this.
"#556 Cat, unfortunately there are people still in Bali who should have either delayed going on their holiday in the first place or left long ago but they were determined to have their 'holiday' . They ignored all warnings and recommendations and some who did decide to go home left it far too late, just trying to squeeze a few more days in before booking a flight found themselves facing cancelled flights and closed airports. Some of these people are now regretting their choices and face a very extended stay in Bali. They will have many challenges as many hotels, restaurants, shops and necessary services are closed and those that are still trading are not far from closing their doors. Those who are left now have plenty of time to reflect on their decisions. Seriously they don't have their heads screwed on straight. It is not only US citizens who are in trouble, other countries have closed their airports also. The health system in Bali is very strained and far below standards of other countries and has no hope of coping. True numbers of cases will never be known. There will never be enough testing carried out, and like other illnesses ie Dengue the locals usually don't seek medical assistance and hence the number of cases are far from the truth. Correspondence I have had with someone who was in hospital in Bali being 'treated' for Corona virus described that even those in 'isolation' wards were being kept in the dark in regards to their test results. The government is covering up as they don't want to cause panic and fear. Sarwa is in his own little world talking to himself, no one is listening."
"Snooky, Yes, I know of this. I was going around like the town crier on various FB travel groups with the U.S. State Dept warnings. People definitely dismissed me as a Debbie Downer or said: ""my president told me not to worry"". Now those people have to deal with the stress, worry, and financial burdens of their actions.Of course, I know that borders are closing everywhere internationally. My response was for people saying that Sarwa is going to the U.S. forum with his campaign, lol."
Cat keep safe and keep on warning people. A few people on this and other forums were also dismissed when they reported information and some posters were boasting about their travel plans and that basically nothing would stop them. It is difficult to watch the news at times and see that there will always be people who disregard warnings and continue to put others lives at risk. The same people then expect authorities to help them out. In the end as you say they will have to live with the implications of their decisions.
Amen SnookyStay safe as well!!

"Even if you test negative for COVID-19, assume you have it, experts sayConventional diagnostic tests for the novel coronavirus may give false-negative results about 30% . Very disturbing. Stay home if you are feeling unwell doubly so if you have traveled."
No mention of Bali itself in this article but I think it’s not unreasonable to extend these issues to there as well.theconversation.com/indonesia-was-in-denial-…Hope everyone is keeping safe. Cheers
"That is extremely worrying for Indonesia including Bali, but I think we all knew it would eventually come to this."
"It would be a challenge though to steer Indonesia through this. It's always easier to simplify it - the government is putting money before people - than to look at all the permutations - the difficulty of changing a very socially close society quickly, the added complication of religious sensibilities, how to support everyone when the safety net has always been family, the lack of the vast majority to work from home, communications when most people rely on the local grapevine rather than the Internet. Do I think they're doing a good job? No, but I don't underestimate the job they have to do."
I agree Mel. Added to that is pressure from religious organisations and politicians with vested interests. It must be a nightmare.
"The true extent of the current spread and eventual deaths caused by corona in Indonesia will never be known. Whatever figures are published can be taken with a grain of salt. Burials take place very quickly, causation is rarely investigated. I am very worried about the months ahead. It will take a long time to recover from this. Social isolation is very difficult to practise when people live in such crowded conditions and when so many people rely on petty trading to put food on the table. No social safety net apart from family in Indonesia."
"Related to number 522 and 533.Please differentiate between Screening Test and Diagnostic Test.Rapid test is screening test and not diagnostic test means positive of rapid test is directly must be confirmed by diagnostic test of Covid-19 test use swab test, whereas rapid test use your blood and test the immunoglobulin, your immunity. So, rapid test, test your immunity as general, but what is definitely infected must be confirmed.If you get blood test and your leukocyte is high mean you are infected, but what kind of infection, must be test further.Based on Jakarta rapid test, from 27, 000 rapid test is only 3 percent is positive and are not mean all have Covid-19. So, from 300 positive rapid test in Sukabumi there are only possibility maximum 9 are positive of Covid-19.I have mentioned also about sensitivity and specificity and you can read at,https:/…Sensitivity_and_specificityAll tests have also False Positive and False Negative, for illustration you can read about Diamond Princess here,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavir…"

"That article sadly paints the picture so perfectly, Snooky and makes a complete mockery of Sawra's attempts to convince folks otherwise. Indonesia would be among the last places you'd want to be right now during this pandemic if you should happen to need hospitalisation. Add to that the stress you would then place on an already inadequate healthcare system that cannot possibly cope. This is precisely why responsible governments were urging their own citizens to return home ASAP.Edited: 2:48 am, April 09, 2020 "

It might ruffle a few feathers within the Indonesian government. Big loss of face to have countries withdrawing their diplomats.
"#578, thanks for posting. Common sense prevails to get home if you are not a resident and have no worthwhile purpose to remain. It just makes you wonder why there are stubborn selfish people who ignored all sensible, responsible advice to return home and have stayed on.

They have no idea what they are doing to the Island. My friends who live in Bali are almost too scared to even go to the shops. They don't understand and only get stuff from the TV.Edited: 11:47 pm, April 09, 2020 "
"I've reported that spam message.Good articles, Snooky. Thanks for posting.It does seem that Indonesia will not only have a very high death rate, but it may also experience a slow ramp up of returning tourists if the virus is uncontrolled."
"Hi,My understanding is that certainly ferry transport from java (and from lombok) is limited to only essential services and Balinese KTP holders so certainly it’s getting harder for people from java to flood into Bali. Flights are also massively reduced from most cities domestically now. Cheers"
"Because there are no lock down, so mobility/transportation is only about 20 percent from the normal, not Nil as in totally lock down.You can read about PSBB, not lock down in Indonesia forum.Mudik is not allowed, so for Bali the problem is migrant workers, mainly who works in cruise ships and not mudik, because only a few Balinese work in Java."
"I read your government paid propaganda piece in the Indonesian forum. Indonesia has no chance of flattening the curve the way they are handling this at the momentEdited: 3:26 am, April 10, 2020 "
"Sarwa says ""Bali and East Java have good recovery and maybe will flattening the curve soon.""I'm not certain Sarwa understands the meaning of the word 'soon' but if he does, he's living on a different planet to the rest of us."
Space Cadet comes to mind.
"So today, Sarwa, Indonesia reported 26 deaths in a single day, and 219 more cases, taking the total to 3512 cases and 306 dead. Yesterday, there were 40 deaths reported. That’s not flattening any curve."
"Flattening the curve is when new cases is same with recovery plus died. For Indonesia is certainly not yet.""Bali and East Java have good recovery and maybe will flattening the curve soon."". Recovery needs from 2 weeks to 6 weeks, so if flattening the curve can be done in 2 weeks, so it is good.Data April 10, 2020, cumulative positive Covid-19 patient is 3,512, died 306, so mortality rate is 8.7 percent, still high, but has slightly drop from 10 percent. You must focus in recovery rate, because recovery rate will increase, but mortality rate will decrease."
"I mean,Flattening the curve is when NEW cases is same with NEW recovery plus NEW died, so the patients in the hospitals are in a stable number and it means the hospitals are sufficient and no need to add.Related to number 282 and 284,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29422…Across Indonesia has also sufficient hospitals."
"So far, Indonesia has now tested 19,500 people out of a population of 267 million. There is a very, very long way to go until “flattening the curve” can even be considered."
"19,500 people is only for the swab test include who has died, because Indonesia still tracing to detect close contact in incubation period and asymptomatic persons.Rapid test is more than 100,000."
"Just report the posts as spam and don't respond - maybe if we social distance him by doing that every time he pops up, we can eradicate the virus from this forum. I have no idea why the admins don't just ban him."
"Australian media outlets reporting this morning that our borders will remain closed until at least the end of 2020. This ban on travel could last for TWO YEARS or more, depending on how the coronavirus threat is progressing in the rest of the world. Bali is in for a long period of economic pain because of this. Unless Indonesia fully eradicates the virus, Australian citizens won’t be going there. Period."

The media has a vested interest in telling us bad news so don't expect them to balance it with any good news.If this situation has shown us anything, it's that we don't know what's around the corner.

"I had a 15 night cruise planned for Christmas with 5 Indonesian ports of call. I already made the decision to cancel almost a month ago based on publicly available information (not necessarily news reports). Things are really bad in Indonesia and other parts of the world. The Indonesian government in particular were too slow to take it seriously and thereby too slow to act. Now it's going to bite them on the bum, ten fold. Regarding hope for a vaccine, it should be understood that to date, there have been no vaccines developed for the other coronaviruses or even HIV. That's with all the squillions of dollars that that have been tipped in to develop a solution. It's going to be a long ride and we've only just buckled up. Cheers"
"I read an article on Kompas. com last night which estimates that around 32,000 people are infected with corona virus in Djakarta alone. This estimation has been done taking into account the relatively few number of tests done and the death rate of detected cases.

"Basically, the less accurate the statistics and testing and the more corrupt the government of a given country, the longer the epidemic will remain and the more widespread it will become. Secrecy and misinformation is a friend to this virus. This is why Indonesia is in such big trouble. No country is going to take at face value infection numbers published by a government who’s own foreign minister promoted the idea that ‘prayer’ would keep the people safe. Countries that have managed to bring Covid-19 under control will simply not risk opening their borders anymore to ones which can’t guarantee the safe passage of travellers. That means that until a vaccine is found the Bali-Australia tourism relationship is frozen in time. Indefinitely.Edited: 6:43 am, April 12, 2020 "

"Sarwa, you are dangerously deluded if you truly think that Bali is handling this pandemic with the same amount of transparently and competence as Tasmania."
"Oops, that should have read 'transparency'."
"Erm, FreshPrince, that link you posted to the Asia Times news article, ""Bali’s mysterious immunity to Covid-19"" , actually gives credibility to Sarwa's contention.The Asia Times author is somewhat bewildered as to why but acknowledges that the Bali status with the virus is consistent with published numbers - i.e the Bali government is telling the truth. He pads the article out of course with speculations and pans the Indonesian govt. but we are where we are so those are just opinions.Given them's the facts then quantitatively as of 15/04/2020 Bali with 98 cases and 2 deaths is doing better than Tasmania with 165 cases and 6 deaths. Having 8 to 9 times the Tasmanian population and Java as a neighbour amplifies matters further. Qualitatively they seem ok too because all but 13 of the cases are imported from overseas workers or Java. Even the 13 cases look to be properly contact traced back to the imports and the follow up done properly.Their Ruby Princess moment is however about to hit with shiploads of returning cruise ship workers starting to arrive at Benoa from tomorrow. That will be a huge challenge but at least they have the experience from elsewhere to draw on - even if it's how not to do it, that's still valuable."
I was very aware of the content of the blog post that I shared. The reason for doing so is that the author appears to be as deluded as our friend Sarwa. It's basically paid government propaganda. The goal is to carry on downplaying the situation in the hope that tourists will start flocking back sooner rather than later. General theme being that Bali is somewhat under control or no worse than many other more developed countries.
"The important thing is how many local transmission is happened. Most of Covid-19 in Bali is not local transmission. If local transmission is a lot, so it means the tracing is done maybe, but do not do until finish. Maybe they found only cluster, but how about sub cluster or sub sub cluster."
"Sarwa, I don't know why you find it hard to understand that the issue is all about credibility. Meaning, just how reliable the figures put out by your government are. Much of the scientific and medical world disputes Indonesia's statistics related to Covid-19 but you keep repeating your governments lines without ever having questioned the accuracy."
"Indonesia has the highest number of Covid-19 fatalities in Asia excluding China but its testing numbers continue to lag its smaller neighbours. The fact remains that, until testing is comprehensively undertaken across its population, no one should entertain thoughts of a holiday there. 30,000 tests across 270 million people is not an adequate gauge of the existing level of the virus’ spread."
"“ There are only 12 hospital beds on average for every 10,000 people — Australia has more than three times as many. And Indonesia has only four doctors and three intensive care beds for every 100 thousand people”. https:/…12145562"
"Lets not bother with figures any more. I would only trust the numbers coming out of Australia anyway, because they are basically honest and in control. Indonesia on the other hand is not controlled (in many things) and they are not honest. You only have to see how they handled the Bali bombings to know that. Nothing has changed since then."
"Hi,Post #615.“The important thing is how many local transmission is happened”There are since yesterday’s figures now ‘officially’ 98 people with Covid-19 in Bali, are you seriously suggesting these cases are all foreigners? Of course there is local transmission, You only have to look at the areas these new cases are occurring to understand that. Cheers"

"Rapid test is accurate only for positive of Covid-19, whereas if negative is very dangerous, because there are Negative False.An Indonesian and an Indian as founder of Self Sensing based on Singapore has made rapid test of Covid-19, but he says it is pre-screening. The sensitivity is good 92 percent, but with all test using blood or test the immunity the negative false is very dangerous. This test maybe suitable for country with many positive patients as USA, but for country with still not too much of positive patients as Indonesia maybe will make many useless cash. As I know from rapid test in Indonesia, we can screening only 3 percent of positive. Or with cost USD 10 per test, we must disburse USD 1,000 for 3 positive patients. If make tracing well and then stratification with under monitoring, under supervision and then test 10 patients with swab test or PCR, will get 3 positive patients or more with cost relatively cheaper or less. Remember, positive of Self Sensing must be test again by swab test or PCR, so there are additional cost 3 x USD 100 = 300.This video will tell you about sensitivity of Self Sensing, but also tell you about negative false.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw8aGzYmNhA"

"To all fellow travelers, At this hardship time, i think that there is no point on arguing on what is right, what is wrong. As a business owner in Bali myself, even though our corporate office is not in Bali, i would like to share a little bit of my thoughts. I was born in Indonesia, studied high school in Perth then college in Seattle so i have mixed experience on how they handle things in each country. Indonesian health care is not as good as other countries that is the truth. Lack of testing is also must be admitted by everyone. However, i believe that Indonesian weather and our daily life help us a lot in this matter. Hot weather i believe is not going to kill the virus, but at least it will make the virus less active. The problem is that in Jakarta our hot zone at the moment, have too many people. They all live in very very crowded areas so even though the virus is less active, i believe it is still spreading but not as severe as our fellow european/american. People's life in Jakarta is very tough and they already get used to on below healthy standard living. Their immune system is much much better i believe. If you look the pictures when flood came in, those children are swimming on the flood. Just think on how much virus/bacteria, etc on that water ? Bali is a little bit different and i believe the reasons on why there is only a little infected is because Bali is not as dense as Jakarta / Java Island. And that helps a lot. This moment of hardship will strengthen the bonds among us, whether families, friends, partners, communities. Think positive and let the world bring back our glorious travelling time."
"I appreciate your sentiments Ryan, but I am only listening to science based facts. Opinions on climate, population density and so-called immunity are precisely why the rest of the world do not believe the Indonesian government"
"Interesting article in the Jakarta post, that Indonesia is running out of testing kits, only 35,000 left.Interesting that they are running out of supply of reagents. According to Sarwa, Indonesia is able to produce their own reagents, something that even more advanced countries are unable to do. Just another reason not to believe our resident propagandist.You can read it here:https:/…"
"@Calla2005, I truly believe that our government lacks of everything but when i said about climate and everything else, it is basically our only hope. I am sorry if what i wrote implicate that tourists should come to bali now. it is totally not what i meant."

Singapore is having a very substantial COVID outbreak right now...I guess it must be pretty cold there?

There are media reports this afternoon that a tourist returning from Bali to West Australia has subsequently tested positive for the virus. The WA Premier announced that this person had travelled over to Bali in March despite warnings re the pandemic. He was explicit in his press conference that the tourist contracted the virus during his holiday there. It will be interesting to see if this is an isolated case (no pun intended) or if a pattern starts emerging.
"Hey folks,We were scheduled to travel on May 19th but flights were cancelled. we are not sure what's best course of action is for us. Should we reschedule for like August or do you think it will still not be possible to have tourists there on August. (Coming from France). Our other option would be to get a voucher but we really want to make this work if possible!Take care all!"
Get a voucher. There's no way of knowing when any of us will be able to safely travel..
"May is way too early to travel to Bali. Mid June is the best we can predict at the moment. On my businesses experience, those travelers who did cancellation on april/ may they re book to July onwards. Safety is the most important thing at the moment. No matter where you are.

"Ryan, you have cross culture. I do not know where are you live in Indonesia and where are you born, so I cannot predict about your culture, because Medanese, Javanese, Balinese, etc are different.I appreciate Balinese with ethical work and discipline, maybe you can feel it. And discipline is important for social distancing.Perth is in West Australia, not busy as in NSW with many Covid-19 positive patients. And between Perth and Sydney is also not too busy as Sydney and Melbourne. Australia get advantage that there are no land border with the neighbour.Whereas all states in mainland USA, except Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico are relatively can be accessed easily by car, not train, and most family in USA have at least a car and one of their hobby are visit camping grounds.About health care, we must differentiate between insurance individual health care and insurance government health care, BPJS which cover low income people. Indonesia learn it from Cuba which Cuba is not developed country, but has the best health care in the world, besides Japan as a rich country. I have relative in USA and work for the insurance, so I know about insurance for low income people and why there are Obama Care and then reduce the fund by Trump and nowadays Trump cut fund to WHO.Jakarta has only about 8 million people, but in work day time there are 11 to 12 million people, because of commuter people from surrounding Jakarta, so no wander if the Covid-19 patients in Jakarta and surrounding are a lot, but Thousands Islands certainly in Jakarta have no Covid-19 patients, because is and islands and the traffic between Jakarta mainland area and the islands is not much.The immune system is depends on the antibody. The antibody will increase if get infection by nature or by vaccine. If we get used with something dirty, so the antibody can increase, as example give bread/biscuit to cleaning service on the street and he/she only wipe his/her hand to his/her dirty clothes and then directly eat it. The question are we want to be a cleaning service, stay at modest dormitory with maybe not all the guests are healthy or stay in Nusa Dua Resort Area."
"Hi Snookystraveltips,Re post #641. Yes, Thursday saw an increase in cases but the Official breakdown is that only 3 of these were local transmissions. Bali has a number of cruise ships docking this week and it’s the disembarking Indonesian crew who seem to make up a number of the new cases. The good news - if there is any - is that numbers are reducing again and yesterday saw 11 new cases and today just 7, although one more death has been announced who appears to be not Indonesian. Whilst the level of testing here should not breed any complacency I can assure you that the authorities and local banjars are now taking this pandemic very seriously, and enforcing masks wearing, and hand sanitation stations or disinfectant gels are appearing everywhere still open. Additionally the governor has annexed several large hotels for the quarantine of returning crews so whilst not a good situation I feel it’s not as bleak as many are implying. Lack of food and work for many however is a really pressing need now. Cheers"
Good to hear returning crew from cruise ships will be quarantined!
Yes it is correct and they will quarantine in the hotel. Not self quarantine on their own village. https://bali.tribunnews.com/amp/2020/04/18/8…I truly proud on Bali government steps on doing all these. If Jakarta can do this since the beginning then I guess Indonesia won't have as much positive case.

They have limited the number of tests per day in order to minimize groups and possibly complicate the spread of the virus. The Bupati has quarantined the entire village, no entry in or out. They plan on conducting similar activities in Karangasem around the location of the other returning PMI who left quarantine and infected 4 others."

"No worries Ginny. Jackie Pomeroy has created an excellent Facebook group to give daily updates on the situation in Bali. Very factual and no nonsense information. Search for Bali Covid-19 Update on Facebook. It is a public group, but you need to join to read the news feed."
"Thanks for that Facebook connection, Calla. Jackie’s Mount Agung posts are really informative so I imagine the Covid - 19 information will be as well. Cheers"
how’s bali beaches right now? can they still be accessed and enjoyed?would relaxing at the beach give you coronavirus?
"Hi,Beaches are closed in most parts of bali. Cheers"
"Interesting - my husband's friend who lives in Canggu has just told us that he thinks his family had the virus in January. His wife went to Lombok for a weekend away with a friend and encountered some Chinese tourists across the breakfast buffet who seemed to have a heavy cold. She and her friend joked about the virus but didn't think too much of it. She comes home, gets the runs and the shivers, he catches it but they end up getting better and the kids didn't seem to get it at all. Now a lot of their friends in the area are saying the same thing - they had some kind of fluey thing at the beginning of the year. So I am thinking that the theory that the virus has already had a first wave in Bali might just be true. Ideally they would get tests to see if they have antibodies but apparently that's just not possible so we'll probably never know but it does make the low numbers now seem more feasible...And he said that shops and restaurants are slowly starting to open again.Edited: 3:23 am, May 08, 2020 "
"Hi,Yes, this is one of the many rumours circulating in Bali. The numbers are remarkably low with most cases stemming from returning workers. There are now no new cases amongst foreigners and low numbers of local transmissions. What is even more striking is that the recovery rate is very high so that of the 279 cases in Bali only 100 are still active, the rest have recovered. I also felt pretty bad in early March after a trip to Malaysia and certainly had a cough for a week or so. At the time only Sanglah was testing and it wasn’t advisable to go and add to the burden, so I’ll never know what it was. What is true is that March and April were hot and humid and that probable helps with lowering transmission. Further to my last post, Gianyar is reopening some beaches but mostly for local fishermen. Beaches on the north coast remain open.Cheers"
Is there some information available when Bali could open up again?
"Hi,One of many reports: https:/…Cheers"
"I was hoping for July but that seems wishful thinking, I guess.."
"There are articles circulating in the West about how Bali is going to reopen to tourists in October. I take this as the official word of the Indonesian govt. If someone can clarify, I've read that it says welcoming tourists from June to Oct. Is June and July more for domestic tourism? October is more for international tourism?Edited: 6:43 am, May 18, 2020 "
"Sorry, it's early here in NYC lol.I see that a promotional campaign for tourism can start from June to Oct.."
"Hi Cat S,Yes, the idea is that if it is safe to do so then domestic tourism will be encouraged to start first, and then from ASEAN neighbours and finally from those countries that allow international travel by the end of the year. Jakarta has talked about giving the Indonesian “upper Middle classes” incentives in the form of discount vouchers etc. to stimulate demand. CheersEdited: 7:56 am, May 18, 2020 "
