"Covid-19 Testing in the State of Quintana RooAs of Sunday March 30, 2020:141 Tests24 Ongoing42 Positive1 DeceasedStay safe out there"
Very little testing . Last population figure I saw of the state was in 2015 was 1.5 million. Not much more. Not going to try to calculate a percentage tested but almost nothing considering the population.
"That is very true Robert. Just wanted people to know that the virus is there and IMO has been there for sometime... but some wanted to deny it since there was no ""official"" acknowledgement."
"I'm with you Robert, I'd like to see a testing clinic on every municipality. However, it's neither practical nor feasible. We're just slowly learning tha facts. The science behind Covid-19 testing states that is unnecessary testing people without symptoms. The results will be negative. It's an urban myth already that people test positive during the incubation period. Symptoms need to be present. I can find the sources if in doubt. Here's the link to the official Covid-19 site in Mexico:https://coronavirus.gob.mx/Edited: 12:35 pm, March 30, 2020 "
"We expect 3 more to be listed as deaths in the next couple of days. The have been less than straightforward with the cases of Covid 19 and they control who gets tested and who doesn't. So by not giving tests, they can keep the numbers down. And they aren't allowing private medical facilities to do any testing at all."
"""And they aren't allowing private medical facilities to do any testing at all."" I knew this But seeing it in print just reinforces the idiocy of it."
What's the point of keeping the numbers down? That gives residents a false sense of security.
I think part of the concern for testing is validating the tests. There’s a high false negative rate. But I am sure they are trying to keep numbers down too. https://www.google.com/amp/s/api.nationalgeo…
"I don't think it is just in Mexico that this is happening, however. I think it is world wide, starting with the lies that came in from China. Look at the 17 huge tents NOW in Central Park in New York...yikes!!!"
"So so sad to say....New Orleans and the surrounding parishes (my parish) is not taking the standard procedures that should be taken. Today, Billy Nuggeser, not sure what he is, but he's a government official said that ""Toledo Bend"" is being closed because, last weekend it looked like a 4th of July party with all the people gathering. People........This HAS to stop"
Billy Nuggeser is your Lt. Governor. I would not know that but saw him today on the news.
Not much testing and you can understand why. It would destroy financial environment of the area.
"Apparently the tests are taking the same route to the lab as the often proposed and oft rerouted Mayan Tren.In the US, this would be called, ""slow walking the sample""."
I am in the hospital almost every week and I have to give a shout out to the nurses and doctors there. They are incredible heroes. Love 'em. sam
"""I am in the hospital almost every week and I have to give a shout out to the nurses and doctors there. ""For sure, Sam. Although you really do need to take better care of yourself LOL.Couldn't help it, mi amigo......"
residents and tourist money...false sense of security ...take care
