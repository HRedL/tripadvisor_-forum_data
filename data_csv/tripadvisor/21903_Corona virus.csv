It has been reported that there are 5 persons who are being tested in GC. Anyone have more info on this?
It has been reported by whom? Source? Link? Throwing out “it has been reported” really doesn’t benefit anybody.
See link below:https:/…
Thank you. Interesting. Sucks that it takes 6 days to get the results back. Ugh.
The same info is also in the Cayman Compass
"5 people, one a visitor, are being tested for POSSIBLE corona. MOST who are tested do NOT have it. I am thinking that anyone who has an occasional cough or sneeze is going to be considered in need of testing."
Unfortunately Marl Road has lost credibility with many locals as there has been some very questionable reporting and most recently an ugly incident with inappropriate photos. I didn’t see the article in the Compass but that certainly doesn’t mean it wasn’t there. There has been speculation about the sick passengers taken off the cruise ship one of whom is said to be in Health City. I will believe it when I hear it from a credible source.

Sending samples because of flu-like symptoms may well be... the flu.I won't start thinking about changing plans until we start getting the results.
"Thanks for the link. I agree with TB. I was sick for two weeks and my business partner right before me. That was all within the last six weeks. If I had gone to the doctor, I might have been in quarantine as well. It is the time of year when people are sick but not all will have Corona. Totally understand the need for caution, but not going to be worried until there is something to worry about."
"There are 5 people being tested. All are quarantined. It will take 6-10 days to know the results. I live here. Trust me, the US influenza is killing many more. This has no bearing. I live on GC and have no fear."
They won't know for 6 days it says.
"AnnS, are you the same person as ""Anna S"" that has been posting news stories about the dump fire?"
It is true. From health authorities
"Good catch, TBNY. If someone attempts to create multiple screen names and play games with TA they will be busted, as others have learned."
As they should.B.
Is there any fear of allowing US visitors into the country if flying to GC if not ill. Have travel plans for April and really do want to go.
rugermojo - I am in the same boat. I really do want to go on my vacation in April. But worried about getting turned around because they are not letting people on to the island in 5.5 weeks time.
"Most flights from the US to GC are 4 or 5 hours. For many who have connections through Miami, Charlotte, Atlanta, etc., they are only a couple hours. Chances are good that if Cayman was to restrict visitors the word would be out there before you board your flight. For an upcoming trip to the States we are monitoring email updates from the airlines which have been very good so far. I expect that we will know if we will be denied entry before we get to board the plane.Edited: 8:39 am, March 11, 2020 "
"That makes sense. But I have until 30 days before my trip to get my condo deposit back. that would be March 17th or 18th. I did buy trip insurance, But it was on Jan 23, which was after Corona virus was a named event. if I wait until closer to the date we leave, i am not sure if trip insurance would cover our condo deposit. its not the end of the world, but I was really looking forward to this vacation. I think i'm probably safer in Cayman since I'll be outside swiming, etc...rather than stuck indoors with other people here in VT."
"The problem is that we have no way of knowing how quickly or where this is going to spread to, or what actions various countries are going to take to try to contain it. Everybody is just guessing right now.So far there have been no cases in the Cayman Islands. That may change. There have been many many cases in the USA, and authorities there are starting to take action against it.There really is no way of knowing. Our guesses on here are about as useful as anyone else's.Some questions to ask yourself:1. Are you in a high risk category (over 70 or with a compromised immune system)2. Are you currently living in an area where there have been outbreaks?3. What is your risk tolerance level?Those are the main ones - nobody can really answer these for you, especially not the third one.Are we likely to lose some discretionary money if we change (or are forced to change) our plans? Yes. Is that really annoying? Yes of course. Is it the end of the world for you? Probably not.These are trying times, and they are likely to become more trying before they get better. All we can do is try to stay as safe as we can, while still trying to enjoy life."
"We are following this closely as well. GC originally ordered tests from the US, which were faulty and never arrived. Now the UK government was supposed to have tests there by this past Monday which would allow for testing done on the island within 24 hours... I guess those tests have not turned up yet. And they have to send all tests off island which can take anywhere from 5-10 days.Edited: 11:42 am, March 11, 2020 "
Cayman Compass. No confirmed positive cases yet. Just self quarantines.https:/…
Why are people posting links to the same news article in this thread over and over again?
"The craziness is astounding! For example, 3 students at Brown University (our 3 all graduated from there) were in isolation and being tested for Covid-19. Today, the test results proved negative for all three. YET they must remain in isolation for the upcoming days per the recommendation of State health department officials. So just because one*might* have it, makes no difference when the test says they do not. Either I am missing something or this is nuts."

"<< ""What would you do? My kids are 5 and 5 months."" >>Personally, I'm not sure I'd be traveling to a foreign country right now with a 5-mo old."
"I am scheduled to fly out on Tuesday with my teenage sons for Spring Break. We're trying to ""hang loose"" since the situation is fluid. Hoping we'll get to make the trip."
A good up to date resource is Cayman Resident website which is the go-to for people who live there: https:/…
"Not yet, I live here and they are taking every precaution."
I talked to my VRBO people today for my upcoming trip and they advised if my flight is cancelled they would refund my money for the condo. Very very nice gesture and puts me at ease a lot more. American Airlines has no change fees now so I am still planning on coming if my flight is still flying. At least I have some peace of mind knowing that I won’t be out the cost of the trip if I can’t go. We’re scheduled to leave April 13 so who knows what will happen by then.
My family will be heading out there 3/24 -3/30 and I'm starting to get very concerned. We booked nonrefundable flights and if we cancel.. there goes our $2500... Staying 5 nights at Ritz booked via 3rd party and i didn't purchase an insurance.just kill me now.
"Well that is terrible but for the many folks who will be losing their jobs and may not be able to return to their homeland with the travel ban things are much worse. It is not going to take food off the table the table for you but it will for them. There are so many workers in the hospitality industry alone who support their entire families in their native countries it is heart breaking. Those retirees who live off invested savings may lose those savings. Bigger issues than losing vacay $ are definitely part of the picture now. Lesson for travelers, shell out for insurance and count your blessings."
"Currently there is no ban on travel from the USA to Cayman. There is now a level 3 warning for travel anywhere abroad. The main point is if you are an older person and/or have underlying health issues the advice is to stay home....note, it is ADVISE. Make up your own mind based on your own situation and level of comfort. As many have aptly said, all airports, airplanes, rental cars, etc will be cleaner than ever before!"
"It is now a pandemic and therefore will be under ""force majeure"" so you should be able to get credit or refunded for all."
That is a clause which removes liability....it does not provide compensation.
From the Cayman Compass just now: Government will be holding a press conference at 4:45pm for an update on the coronavirus. Visit the Cayman Compass Facebook page for live coverage of the announcement.
Is tourists still being aloud there from the states? We fly out next Friday and I just was told that Cayman isn't letting tourist in.
<< “ I just was told that Cayman isn't letting tourist in.” >>Told... by whom?
Here we go again! Look at gov.ky or even the Cayman Airways home page for a link on developments. Not saying that will not happen but it is not currently the case.
"I just love the random quotes of “I was told.” Told by whom is right. If you’re going to post, please post accurate information including sources so as not to spread false information or hearsay. It benefits NOBODY to just causally pass long information that you heard. That’s cool that “you heard” but people are more concerned when “you hear” from a legitimate source. We are all trying to make important decisions about our vacations and most of us have spent hard earned money planning and preparing for upcoming trips. Providing accurate information would be greatly appreciated moving forward. Thanks. Sincerely,Everyone"
"Unfortunately it will be all around us & for those with travel plans I think you have to do what feels best for you & your loved ones. I was too anxious with the latest that it is airborne after all and after hearing & reading certain comments on the live conference, we cancelled our trip tomorrow. Very very sad but also a bit relieved... vacation should be relaxing and I would be worried on a daily basis what might happen next that might affect our return... or what might happen in a matter of days- while we are there- that might make people panic and essentials willStart running out, like it’s happening here ... anyway... prayers all this resolves quick and everyone can return to a normal life again."
Unfortunately it is there now.https:/…
At least the good news is the infected person is doing well and did not tour the island. He was transferred straight from the ship to the hospital. Very isolated incident.
Not sure where your info is from. There are a number of health workers who have been out and about who worked at the facility where he was which is now closed. Posting misinformation helps no one.
"My info was strictly based on link below that was posted by a different user. if the article is full of sh?t, then I do apologize but i haven't read an article about health workers being out and about. https:/…"
"That’s why cutting and pasting isn’t always best. Some people are notorious for it. No worries. If you want the best up to date info go to gov.ky, their FB page etc. often when stuff actually gets in print down here it is already stale news. This situation is changing rapidly. We are awaiting announcements on the new situation now. Most of the regular posters on here read the Compass, Cayman 27 News, Cayman News Service and to a much lesser extent Marl Road. Right now locals are looking on official sites not social media for timely and hopefully accurate info. For people worried about flight restrictions watch the Cayman Airways page for updates. They will know immediately of any government bans or travel related relevant updates. Yesterday we had two personal emails and two emails to the business within minutes of the gov press conference. They are on top of it."
"Now at our place on Grand Cayman. To be clear, the ""facts"" here are changing quickly and it is really not necessary to bash people who post info when you have later facts. This is a real-time event.Here’s the latest, but be aware revisions are always possible.The 68 year old Italian gentleman was moved from a cruise ship along with his wife on February 29 (not March 9 as reported earlier). He was taken to the medical facility on the South Shore due to a sever cardiac issue. That has stabilized but on March 9 he was tested for SARS-CoV-2 because he developed respiratory symptoms a day or two before.The test was returned on March 12 as positive for Covid 19. I have seen no announcements as to whether he was in or not in isolation for the initial few days, but there are 30 healthcare workers under quarantine so draw your own conclusions. The facility has been closed for two weeks as well. Government Is meeting today to decide on addition countries to add to the “do not come” list. No info if the US would be on the list, but unlikely in my opinion.Those are the current facts, but who knows what tomorrow may bring."
Thank you much for the info. Just read about the flight passenger that coughed. Decided to cancel this month's trip and postpone it for few months. I will continue to monitor these news path.

We are in a similar boat. Two young kids. We are fine and healthy.
My family has plans to be there next week. How are restaurants and grocery stores being affected?
"Grocery stores are not affected but restaurants are limited to 50 people. Have no idea is that 50 includes both staff and patrons.Edited: 7:53 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Do the current Coronavirus restrictions, and closings on Grand Cayman also apply to the Sister Islands of Cayman Brac and Little Cayman?"
They apply to the Cayman Islands as a whole - I didn't hear or have seen anything that is specific to Grand.
Sadly we have canceled our trip too. We will definitely visit when this clears up. Hopefully late summer.
"We're still trying to figure out what to do, we have family scheduled to fly in from NYC and Colo. Regal Beach Resorts has been great in changing their cancellation policy to let us postpone our trip without losing our money. We're waiting on ShangriLa B&B, the other place we have reservations at and had paid in full to see if they will let us postpone. We've always used TA to pick our hotels but are learning a lesson about travel insurance. Hope everyone stays safe and healthy. Will report back when I hear from ShangriLa and please keep info coming from the Caymans."
Are the beaches impacted by the 50 person rule? We are supposed to be arriving from the US tomorrow morning and staying at the Westin 7 mile beach. I just want to make sure we can actually enjoy the beach. In prior years there has always been more than 50 people out on the beach.
"Hi Julie, we are also arriving at the Westin tomorrow. :) I read on the government site that the 50 person rule doesn't apply to the beach unless you have arranged a gathering of 50 people yourself (like a wedding group, etc)."
"We are in the same boat stuck in Georgia, VT holding our breath that the island doesn’t extend their 3 week flight restriction. We all need some Cayman love as long as we are healthy."
"I honestly cannot fathom that people are still not cancelling their plans to travel from the US. I’m sorry, but that just might be the dumbest and most selfish crap I’ve ever seen. Cancel your vacation people. Your life won’t end if you have to reschedule. My god."
