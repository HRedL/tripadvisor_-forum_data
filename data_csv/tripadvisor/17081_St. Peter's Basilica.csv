"Hi, am I right in thinking entrance is free? Unless you want to skip the line? How do I book to go up the dome? Do I do that on the day or can I purchase online?"
There are no tickets for St. Peter's Basilica - admission is free.Tickets for the Dome Climb are bought on the day of visit. They only accept currency and coin - no cards are accepted.
The ticket kiosk is #11 on this map:http://stpetersbasilica.info/floorplan.htm
"Entrance is free to enter the Basilica.To go up to the Dome you have to que for the tickets on the day. Its 10 Euros by elevator or 8 Euros to walk up 550 steps. Beware even with the elevator you get to the Dome but you will need to climb up 220 steps to get to the Cupola. It is worth the effort as the views are amazing.Edited: 4:46 pm, March 01, 2020 "
