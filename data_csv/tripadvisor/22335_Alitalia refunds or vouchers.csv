"Good morning I haven’t tried calling Alitalia in over a week and at that time they weren’t budging. We are scheduled to travel March 27- April 6 from the US to Rome. My employer (a hospital) is not allowing us to travel to Italy and i completely understand. I was waiting for hopefully a travel ban from the US so that we may be able to get a refund as we are three weeks out still, or a cancellation of our flight to get a refund. I wouldn’t mind a voucher but we cannot fly again until October as we don’t have the time off of work until then. Does anyone know what Alitalia is offering now as of today for people scheduled to fly in the next few weeks? It seems the US airlines are making rebooking a little easier. Thank you for any info"
"https:/…info-flights.htmlI anticipate that Alitalia's waiver policies will change as the Coronavirus situation deepens and spreads further south. New cases of Coronavirus are DOUBLING EVERY 2.6 DAYS. The statistics at the end of March will be completely different from today.As for flying with Alitalia in October, you may need a fair amount of good luck: nobody knows what will happen after May 31:https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coron…There is speculation in some Italian media that Alitalia will need to be nationalized (again) in order to survive."
Thank you. And i know it’s a long shot that hey will even be in existence in a few months. Just hoping the refund policy changes over the next few weeks
