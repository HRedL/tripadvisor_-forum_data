We had a trip planned for end July into August and with the 14 day quarantine we made the difficult decision to cancel our trip. If there are any Mainers who need a house in downtown Bar Harbor I can give you the name in a private message. The rental agent we've worked with has been so nice so I'd love to give the company an opportunity to re-rent the home.I called the resort in Boothbay Harbor today to cancel our 2 night stay there and I felt SO bad for the gentleman I spoke with. I could hear the sadness and frustration in his voice. I felt guilty by having to cancel.This whole thing just sucks. I'm saying a prayer for Maine's economy through this and all the small business owners who are feeling the pain from the restrictions.
There will be no 14 day quarantine in July/ August. Sorry you cancelled because of that.
"We are under the impression that the 14 day quarantine is in effect until August 31st. Without any assurances that it will be lifted we don't want to take any chances. We were told we could go into the park but had to mask up and wear gloves, we couldn't eat in restaurants or do curbside pickups, we couldn't go shopping and to be honest this just isn't a chance we're going to take."
"Justbreathe - is there a reason you didn't wait this out a bit longer to see what happens? Things are changing daily and weekly. We are scheduled for late September with a bit of hope that all will be ok with travel issues, Maine quarantine restrictions and whatever current virus situation is at that time, but not ready to give it up now. Do you have cancellation restrictions. I would think rental contacts would be working with people."
"Calypso, I'm curious how you can make that statement? Do you have definite knowledge or are you just predicting?"
"@Linda We'd planned a trip to the Canadian Rockies for 2 years as a graduation gift for our granddaughter and her best friend that we had to cancel due to the border closure. This was our Plan B and with the way things are going in Maine, we just don't have confidence the governor is going to loosen the restrictions. Our rental agent isn't confident either. We've not cancelled the house yet and we still have flights from Bangor to home. All we'd have to do is book flights to Bangor to salvage it. We wanted to have a Plan C in place because of the location we picked flights were going fast and we really wanted to have a solid trip for the girls to look forward to. Maine just doesn't feel like right now. We will give it 2 weeks but we're not holding our breath.The limitations on what we can do while in Maine just seem not worth it to us."
"I understand. So sad for all of us. We had to cancel 2 week trip to St. John in late March which seemed devastating at the time, but we got through it. If our September trip to Maine works out it would be great, but if not, we'll get through that also. Good luck to you and your family and stay safe and healthy!"
@Linda We also gave our granddaughter the opportunity to decide what she wanted and she chose the for sure option over the maybe.
"Am curious where Calypso (Post # 1) is getting their information that ""there will be no quarantine in July/August"" The Plan to Restart Maine's Economy announced at Governor Mill's April 29th news conference clearly stated that the 14-day quarantine requirement for visitors, or for Mainers returning to Maine from out-of-state, would be in effect through the end of August. In news conferences as recently as the end of this past week, health officials have indicated that the quarantine remains their ""best weapon against Covid importation from outside Maine."" A court suit has been filed seeking to have the quarantine declared illegal and the federal Department of Justice has called it illegal as well, but as recently as the end of the week, a federal judge declined to issue a restraining order banning enforcement while the case made its way through the court system. As of now, the quarantine, and its original schedule, are still in place, unless Calypso knows something that hasn't yet been announced by Maine's governor or Maine CDC. Absent definitive, authenticated evidence to the contrary, saying definitely that it will be gone by any set date is, at this point, wishful thinking or possibly misguided optimism. Nobody, inside or outside of Maine likes the quarantine, but it remains our only real protection against importation of the virus from other parts of the country where it is far more prevalent. Sorry that your trip is a casualty of Maine's need to protect those of us who live here, JustBreathe."
"We are scheduled to visit the island at the end of July and are trying to wait it out until mid-late June, with hopes the restrictions will be revised. We will likely cancel our air tickets very soon and now drive the 12 hour drive, if the Island does away with the quarantine. We have a lodging deposit and I hate to cancel on our inn keeper, so am waiting as long as possible. But at some point we need to decide. I keep checking in here to see if there is any inside information."
"We are canceling our trip as well, in Sept. I know there is talk of it ending by then, but I don't want to wait that long and then be out of luck and other places not be avail.We were just in Hilton Head this weekend, and while it was relatively under-crowded, it was certainly active. And seemed relatively well-layed out in terms of safety. Some of the restaurants we ordered out from, were using some safety features I liked and had not yet seen in the Charlotte area. I guess I'll wait some time to see if there are any significant sickness outbreaks identified to originate out of the travel there before finalizing plans...but thinking now we'll just do HHI again this fall instead of Maine. The restaurant owners and shop owners I spoke to were extremely happy with decisions made by state and local leaders to open up with limitations to protect safety but also financial stability..."
"Laura B, Post # 9 -- In addition to checking back here (and other Trip Advisor Forums) where information may be anecdotal or only partially correct although well-intended, you may want to also check Maine State Government's official Covid-19 Information website at https://www.maine.gov/covid19/"
"We are moving ahead with our plans to visit Bar Harbor and Acadia in mid/late September at this point. We were supposed to currently be in Yosemite this week with accommodations inside the park, but obviously that wasn't going to happen. Our back-up trip will be Bar Harbor/Acadia in September for my birthday.We're praying no further restrictions will be imposed and, for those who had summer trips planned, praying current restrictions are eased very soon. The rest of the country is getting back to somewhat of a normal situation for travel, and so should Maine!! All areas of the country shouldn't be treated and judged the same as some of the ""hot spots"" for Covid-19."
"951 new cases in New York State yesterday 5/31 in a state with 19.5 million population.43 new cases in Maine yesterday 5/31 in a state with population of 1.3 million population.So the new case rate is about the same for both states. If you're Mainer, you're more likely to get it from your neighbor at church or in the meatpacking plant you work in than from a visiting New Yorker at whatever hiking trail the New Yorkers congregate on."
Thank you for the link Mainer-On-The-Go. I appreciate the solid source and will check in a few weeks.
"Randall....yep, but the governor and CDC director there couldn't figure out how to protect its people from what we keep being told here. So the economy tanks and small business owners will lose pretty much the entire summer. Even Disney World --- and they certainly draw from all the places Maine is worried about -- figured out how to do it safely."
"Randall and Wafrye -- Interesting to hear folks from hundreds of miles away trying to tell Maine officials how best to deal with Covid-related tourist issues in our state. No danger of catching Covid at church because (unlike some other places where it continues to spread) we're still doing church services on-line or in safe outdoor settings where we can observe social distancing -- and indoor church service guidelines have been issued for resumption of indoor services soon. Part of the reason our new-case rate remains where it is relates to the fact we have the highest per-capita percentage of older residents in the nation; meaning more of us are more highly-susceptible to contracting Covid if we come in contact with it. We also have a high number of cases related to nursing home and assisted living settings as opposed to spread through the general population, so who's to say our current methods aren't working. Given our demographics, the fact that we're ""about the same as other states"" may be a sign that interdiction measures are, in fact, working.The most effective method so far for protecting the majority of Maine citizens is to reduce the odds we'll be exposed to it. And the way we've chosen to do that is by establishing quarantine requirements (which have been proven effective almost everywhere) and other measures intended to cut back on importation from outside the state. It may not match other folks ideas of what should be done, but it's the way our officials have chosen to reduce what could be an even greater influx of the virus with fewer or looser restrictions in place. And June 1st marked the relaxing of a number of earlier restrictions as part of a reopening of Maine's economy in stages, except, interestingly enough, in the counties in southern Maine; the same places which experience heavier daily and weekend influxes of travelers from outside Maine; and the same places where ""community transmission"" of the virus remains the highest... maybe from visitors ""congregating"" on popular hiking and walking trails or beaches without proper masking or social distancing?Officials are already aware of the tourism and business impacts and continue to reassess the situation daily. For example, today's Maine CDC media briefing reported they are actively working on guidelines under which cruise ships will be allowed to return to Maine ports.Edited: 4:25 pm, June 01, 2020 "
"""So the new case rate is about the same for both states.""Maybe I'm too stupid to understand, but how is 48.9 per million ""about the same"" as 32 per million? Based on my recollection of 2nd grade math it sounds like the rate in NY is 52% higher than the per capita rate in ME. But again, maybe I'm just too stupid to make a reasonable comparison."
"Mainer: you mean from places where tourists are already entering? First, you act like allowing tourism is going to turn ME into the scenes from the Lake from the Ozarks. Nobody advocates that, and authorities would be wise to shut that kind of thing down quickly.BTW, I think you'll find just about everywhere is similar to ME in that the predominant # of deaths are in retirement centers. NC where I am is 2:1 congregate care death to general population. Very sad, but probably speaks to the fact that people living normal lives (especially with social distancing) is much less a cause than receiving intimate personal care in congregate care facilities? I wonder if that is why places like GA - where all the media predicted catastrophe, have been doing ok after reopening earlier than anyone?Maybe your officials should check with leaders in places like the Yellowstone NP corridor -- similarly low population centers with limited medical facilities who bring in people from all over the world, but effective today, have relaxed all quarantines? Or places like the FL & SC coast, with large groups of visitors from out of state, who have been flowing into some of the beaches for weeks and at least have not been reported any significant outbreaks. You keep saying that your leaders understand the business impact (devastating) but can't think of anything better to do than keep people out. Are other state leaders just less caring? Or do they trust local leaders and business owners to smartly implement social distancing so that they can (1) stay healthy and (2) stay in business?Edited: 5:38 pm, June 01, 2020 "
"If you think that Maine is making incorrect decisions and is following a bad model, then feel free to go elsewhere. We're doing the best we can. You might agree with our governor or you might think she is completely wrong, but in the end, she is working for the citizens of Maine.If you could drive/fly into the state tomorrow, you would not necessarily find what you are looking for. We are still lining up for groceries and hoping we find Lysol /Clorox wipes (not likely), our preferred brand of toilet paper (we've learned not to be picky) and some meats. We all have lists that our friends share so we can buy for each other when the rare items are sighted. Some Hannaford stores just re-opened their seafood sections. Ironic, right? Funtown/Splashtown is closed for the summer, the summer theaters aren't doing any plays, the Sea Dogs aren't playing and restaurants may/may not be open or are only serving outside, take-out only, etc. Lobstermen may or may not be going out and I could probably cut a deal to swap the already-mentioned toilet paper for lobsters in certain parts of our state. Our hospitalization rate is headed back up. So yes - we can enjoy the great outdoors and breathe some fresh air, but Vacationland is not ready for everyone to show up, especially if they're not Covid free. A lot of our neighboring states have similar policies, but I do not see the level of complaining on their forums that I have seen here. Canada isn't letting any of us in and they're right next door, too. To those of you who understand and are patiently waiting for things to get better, thank you. We're waiting, too."
"FWIW, we cancelled our Fall trip from Socal to New England as well. Yes, disappointing for sure. But in the event of a second wave or continued COVID issues, we didn't want to find ourselves suddenly quarantined a long ways from home. On one of the locally owned properties, we donated a portion of our deposit to help cover some of the lost income. We hope to re-make this trip in a year or two."
"I think CB sums things up pretty well in Post # 19... especially as it relates to travel and vacationing conditions in Maine right now. Thanks, CB. Your comments helped remind me that Trip Advisor is intended to be a travel information site, not a political forum (there are plenty of other websites for that elsewhere).Regardless of whether or not we agree with the current travel rules in place in Maine, they still are the rules for anyone (visitor or native) wishing to travel into or around Maine. Nothing we say about them here on Trip Advisor will change them, much as we might sometimes wish otherwise.No one in or outside Maine is totally happy with the current situation, but it is what it is. And I am happy to do my best to answer questions about the current rules, travel conditions and other travel-related questions. But it occurs to me that lengthy politically-based discussions don't belong here. They interfere with people being able to get help with travel-related information they need to make good travel decisions. Hopefully I can do a better job of reminding myself of that going forward.To would-be Maine visitors who have decided not to come, I'm sorry. And for what it's worth I share your pain, having cancelled two 2020 trips of my own due to Covid-19 considerations. Hopefully the coming days and months will produce a safer, more travel friendly environment for all of us."
"""We are still lining up for groceries and hoping we find Lysol /Clorox wipes (not likely), our preferred brand of toilet paper (we've learned not to be picky) and some meats.""This is also happening in states which have completely reopened too, so you're not suffering any more than any of the rest of us. However, life goes on, and it should be allowed to go on in Maine just like other places have already done.We want to come and visit; we want to spend our money there; we want to enjoy what Maine has to offer that we can't get where we live. We're plucking down big money to visit with airline tickets, hotel expense, car rental, food, etc. I guess mindsets are just going to be different, but if other states can pull off reopening and welcoming visitors without the world coming to an end, I would think Maine could do it as well if they really wanted to."
"Hey Cubs fan. New Hampshire requires that you quarantine for 14 days *before* you arrive. You're free to roam upon arrival. The White Moutains offer some great hiking opportunities, and they have beaches there too. New York requires no quarantine at all....the Adirondacks and Finger Lakes are lovely in the summer.Both of those states seem like they are in a more welcoming mood, and will gladly accept your money."
Can I ask the practical question of how a quarantine will be enforced? Is the hospitality industry going to make you prove when you crossed the border? And how would that be proven? We have an outdoor funeral / burial trip planned in 3 weeks and we are not canceling it (nor will be quarantining). Practical thoughts requested please.
"Randall,While those are fine alternatives, we have our hearts set on Acadia and Bar Harbor this September for my birthday after having to cancel our Yosemite trip scheduled for this week (May 30-June 6). Obviously, if we can't make this work in a reasonable time beforehand, we'll have to look at alternatives, but when flights are involved, planning isn't as easy to do last minute as a road trip would be. BTW, we do have a road trip to an alternative location a little closer to home as a back up for September, but hoping we don't have to resort to that."
I guess the OP shouldn't have scrapped their trip and I guess Calypso knew what he/she was taking about.https:/…
Grrrrr.....I'm so torn......we've made other arrangements that can be changed. Gotta figure this out.....
"RE: Post # 24: Enforcement of whatever rules are in place (currently a 14-day quarantine with alternatives being discussed but not yet adopted) is a multi-level affair. On one level, because it was put in place by an Executive Order of the Governor, law enforcement at all levels (state, county and municipal) are charged with enforcement responsibilities. On another level, innkeepers knowingly allowing violations may find their government-issued lodging licenses revoked or suspended. They also have an incentive to participate because no innkeeper I know wants their property to become known as ""the place that had Covid virus"". And perhaps even more importantly, they don't want to have to bear the brunt of resentment (and worse) from friends and neighbors as ""the one who allowed Covid to come to our community."" Most Maine innkeepers have enough integrity, and enough respect for the people who live in their community, to do what they're supposed to do."
"I read and re-read the article and then spoke with our rental agent and she said that it's not implemented at this point and has no idea when/if it will be. So, we're sticking with our plan to cancel and come to Maine when things are better."
"JustBreathe, Maine will be there when the state and you feel the timing is right. Sounds like you're comfortable with Plan C and now you can relax. Enjoy!"
"Thank you Linda! We are very happy with plan C. We were in Maine last May so we know the beauty! It's not going anywhere, like you said!"
"I would appreciate some clarification from Maine residents.  We will be in a 'rural' county per the Maine Reopening beginning June 29. From the documents on the state's website they have already began to reopen. I interpret that on July 1 these rural counties will no longer require quarantine? Since we arrive before July 1, how do we 'prove' we have quarantined for the previous 14 days? Is there some place to 'check in'? Have they set up stop points at the borders? Am I correct in my interpretation that the quarantine requirements are before we arrive? I want to be in compliance with the guidance.Thank you!"
"Lodging in Maine, in rural counties, has opened June 1st but only to Maine residents. As of July 1st, lodging is open to Maine residents and those who have quarantined IN MAINE for 14 days prior to their lodging.There is no place to check in and no border stop points, that I know of. Kind of an honor system."
"""Kind of an honor system""No really - per the Governor's memorandum:""Individual violations of this Order may be charged as a Class E crime subject to a penalty of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. Additionally, any lodging, park, or campground operator who violates this Order may be construed as violating any license, permit or other authorization to operate and be subject to appropriate penalties.""So not only the out of state tourist faces charges but the proprietors of the Maine lodgings would not want to run afoul of the dictates from their Governor."
"You cross the border and get into the state on the honor system. If you get caught, there is a punishment."
"In addition to tourist that ""cross the border"" per the Governor's mandate it is a Maine proprietor providing lodging that needs to be concerned if they run afoul of the dictates from their Governor they can be ""violating any license, permit or other authorization to operate and be subject to appropriate penalties."""
"Our rental agent said we could hike and exercise while visiting but we had to wear masks and gloves outside, complete and total social distancing, no shopping, no tours, and no dining out while in Bar Harbor."
"Does your rental agent represent the State of Maine and / or the Governor's office? Thought not. If your travels take you to Maine during the quarantine - and you do not isolate for 14 days - be prepared to pay the fine ($ 1,000) and do the time (up to 6 months in jail). Your ""rental agent"" should be prepared for the ramifications of renting to an out of state guest during the quarantine as well.Edited: 9:45 pm, June 06, 2020 "
"""Our rental agent said"" ....Ask him again as the rules are expected to be updated this week"
"Maybe this is what the rental agent was referring to:CDC officials say people in quarantine can go for a walk, but they must wear a face mask and stay six feet apart or more from others. But they do recommend people in quarantine avoid going for walks along heavily traveled trails and be ready to keep their distance from others during chance encounters.https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/news…"
"Thank you, RVA, that is exactly what our agent was referring to. We're not going now but this could be good information for those who choose to go even with these diktats in place."

"Read the article a little further:""That means no shopping, going for takeout, picking up supplies at a hardware store. Anything that would expose others at risk.""""The CDC guidelines also point out if you have to come to Maine, and bring everything you need, and don't interact with others, it wouldn't violate the quarantine order if you stayed in Maine for fewer than 14 days."" Perhaps Maine will begin easing some of these restrictions soon to invite tourists back to the state !"
"We will be packing up our grad student in Boston and want to take a week in Maine at the end of August. We will be coming from Louisiana and doubt we will ever be back that way. Do you think it’s going to be possible. We know all about the 14 day quarantine with trying to visit TX and FL, but those were lifted. You think it will be possible to come there?"
tarilyn: I'd keep my options open and my eyes on the quarantine in Maine....It might be lifted by the end of August but right now it's through August 31st. I'd not book anything non refundable.
"I've mentioned in a couple of posts that there will be no dining in no curbside or delivery, no shopping, no tours no nothing but the ability to go outside to get some fresh air...with restrictions.....masking up and gloves. Maybe I was too vague and I apologize for that."
https://www.maine.gov/covid19/These are the guidelines from the Maine government website.
"]Susie,That website has been linked and discussed previously in this thread. The governor will decide when the state will open up to visitors without restrictions.Edited: 2:39 pm, June 07, 2020 "
We have booked lodging for July 4th weekend and hope the quarantine order is gone by then or we will have to cancel.
"Unfortunately, Northern Traveler, you are not alone. Dozens of other would-be visitors in the same boat. The Governor, the state Dept, of Economic Development, and the tourism, lodging and restaurant industries are currently reviewing and discussing a proposed revision to the 14-day-quarantine requirement that would instead require medical certification that visitors had been Covid-free for 14 days prior to coming to Maine. Still very much just a proposal, so wouldn't base any non-cancelable plans on it... but at least they are still actively reviewing and discussing alternatives. The bottom-line for the Governor and her administration, and for many industry folks as well, remains protection for Maine residents and those who work in tourism-related industries. Stay tuned."
"I will.Funny thing is, the first place I wanted to book I had to call as their reservations site was down. We have stayed there before and they know I am out of state and they were happy to book us in without any warning about these regulations. Only turned it down as they had a multi day minimum that we couldn't meet, and then I found out about these rulesEdited: 8:07 am, June 08, 2020 "
There is now an alternative to the 14-day quarantine requirement.See https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g28940…
"The alternative should help some travelers, especially business travelers, and I completely understand the reason behind the 14-day quarantine to begin with. For our family of 5, I am not sure we can be certain of being able to obtain a test and a result within 72 hours of pleasure travel. In our area, they have just started wide spread testing and I need to check if we are at the stage of ""anyone who wants a test, can get a test."" Since we need to cancel our lodging 21 days in advance for a partial refund I am not sure we can take the risk of being sure we can all just go get a test, and they will test us all, simply because we are headed on vacation. Am I missing anything on this (i.e., home tests are coming out etc.)?"
"We can easily get tested in our area, but no way we'd get results back if the test has to be done within 72 hours of traveling.We travel on Saturday, thus we'd need a test by at least Wednesday or Thursday. Results of tests in our area are routinely taking a week to get back. How's that going to work?"

"In my area, my local walk in clinic is offering a 20 minute rapid result test. Just thought I'd share -- you might want to call around and ask."
"There is no way to tell you about August right now. Several states that opened up before Maine are already experiencing a shortage of hospital beds and a spike in virus cases. By the first of August, Maine could shut down again faster than it re-opened. Too bad wishful thinking doesn't get rid of a pandemic, we'd be in the clear for sure."
"I'm still fine with us having cancelled our trip for July. Sad, but fine. It was just too stressful to wonder if we'd go, we wouldn't go, could we get take-out, did we have to just stay at the rental. We just needed something to be finalized to take away what's already a very stressful time. Now that the quarantine requirements have changed as some thought it might, there's still no way that we'd have results of testing back in 3 days and we're in a State that has testing easily available. As our State has re-opened, more people are being required to be tested regularly and has slowed down the resulting process. I, for one, wouldn't be comfortable getting a ""rapid test"" (don't know of any available here anyway), but with the lowered result accuracy, I wouldn't take a chance that it was incorrect and come to Maine anyway. Oh well, that's just us. We're already starting our countdown to next summer and I've been doing some shopping online from several Maine businesses. Stay well, Mainers!"
Willow: I feel the same...I'm sad but we're very happy with our new plan and just knowing something is concrete is so helpful!
"We are in the process of moving forward with booking a place on the island. We received the updated quarantine information from the real estate company. It indicates that the quarantine does not apply to those visiting the state who've tested negative for the virus, as long as a negative test result is recorded within 72 hours of arrival. Children under the age of 18 are not required to be tested. With the availability of testing increasing, this seems like a workable solution for us."
My problem is booking a flight. I don’t want to book a flight for a week and then realize we can’t go.
"What I don't see is a way to stop someone from taking a day trip to Maine. We're canceling our hotel but were considering a drive up along the coast for some lobster rolls. I expect if we were sick (we aren't) and weren't wearing masks (we will be) that we would be just as ""dangerous"" to others as if we stayed in a hotel.Doesn't make sense to me"
"Tarilyn, I do understand that. We've booked and re-booked and canceled so many flights it isn't funny. Thankfully we travel quite a bit and can use the vouchers for future flights. You'll have until approximately 2 weeks before you have to leave to book flights before the costs go up. Just keep checking the fights and wait until you get closer to book."
"Flights are also our problem. If we wait to see if the quarantine goes away for September for sure, we may miss out on flights we need as our dates are pretty set in place and non-flexible. We also won't be able to do the ""72 hour testing"" thing likely either, as they are not doing rapid testing in our area and results are taking a week or more to come back.if we rebook already cancelled flights, we run this risk of having to cancel again, then be charged or penalized because it's the 2nd cancellation we've made.Just open up the state and let us come without restrictions, and we'll gladly come and spend our money there.Edited: 11:19 am, June 11, 2020 "
"Kats_Cubs_fan - I believe you said the same thing in another post about opening up with no restrictions and you will be happy to spend your money there. Unfortunately for you, you are not in charge of deciding when a state opens up in order to keep it's residents safe and healthy. Who knows, you could spread Covid-19 around along with your dollars.As someone else pointed out earlier, there are many beautiful places that are open with no restrictions and if you booked in one of those areas, you could make all of your plans and relax a bit.I understand the frustrations we are all dealing with, but these are the times we are living in right now.We also have a trip for late September planned and hope for the best, but we will totally understand if the trip doesn't work out depending on the current situation. I have lodging booked that I can cancel within 5 days and booked flights with AA at a very reasonable price which we can change for a later date. It would not surprise me at all if there is a second wave in which case everything would pretty much shut down again."
"We've already cancelled flights with AA for California for last week once, so any booking we do for Maine would be our ""rebooked"" flights from that; they won't let us cancel and rebook a 2nd time from what I understand as any ""credit"" for cancelled trips get just one shot at rebooking.Sorry, but we are pretty much open for business everywhere now down South, and we plan to keep it that way, regardless of a so-called ""2nd wave"" coming..and it will of course, but live and let live is my motto. If you're in a vulnerable health situation, stay in and avoid getting out, but if not, let the rest of us go on with our lives and live as we will."
"Hey Cubs Fan:1. Weren't you eligible for a refund from American? As you may recall, we cancelled our trip to California as well, and got full refunds on our American Airlines tickets.2. It sounds like you may want to vacation in the American South, where perhaps more people share your philosophy. If not, there are plenty of other places around the world that are opening back up, why not pick one of those places? I bet California might even work again, in September.3. It appears that Rapid COVID testing IS available in your state. And if not yet available in your town, it seems likely that it would be by September.https://cvshealth.com/newsroom/press-release…4. The Cubs suck. Their fans are the biggest bunch of obnoxious bros of any fan base in baseball.Cheers!"
"No, we were not offered a refund from American which is what we wanted; only a credit for future flight was offered.I've vacationed in the American South all my life and would drive there if we were so inclined to do that; we want to go where we've not yet been. I've been to California (Yosemite to be specific) in the fall before so we don't want to go there again that time of year; we wanted to go in the spring or not go there at all.Yes, while rapid testing is likely available in Atlanta and in some of the larger cities of GA, it's not in my rural community that I'm aware of according to my doctor's office when I recently checked.I won't respond to your Cub fan comment as it's not worth responding to."
"It seems like if you were flying to Maine, you'd need to fly from a larger city in Georgia. Not from your rural community. Stop by a place that has the rapid test on your way to the airport. Make sure you give yourself enough time. Or even drive the day before, take the test, and stay in a hotel near the airport the night before your flight. Bingo, problem solved. Then pray you don't pick up anything in the busy airport or on the high risk flight.Now, if someone can just point me to where i can get a free, rapid test when not exhibiting any symptoms in northern VA.Edited: 2:44 pm, June 11, 2020 "
"I'm a bit confused. I know several groups of people (not me) that have booked motels and campgrounds on the Maine coast (York, Scarborough, Old Orchard Beach). When calling the campground and motels asking about the 14-day quarantine, they were told NO quarantine. These groups are going at different times throughout August. They also are return guests year after year.As a side note and I'M NOT SAYING ITS RIGHT, I've been told that there is no way to monitor who is and isn't quarantining when coming from out of state. It sounds to me that businesses are in jeopardy for fear of losing their business and are encouraging people to come."

"harleygal - the information from the campground/motel is incomplete. If you do not plan to quarantine, you must arrive with a recent (within 72 hours) negative Covid-19 test (all adults age 19 and over). Also be aware that Maine is projected to go from 50 positive cases daily (in June) to maybe 2000 positive cases daily in mid-August and 7000 cases daily by the end of September. This means running out of hospital beds at some point, possibly as early as mid-August. So the rules might get even tougher before they ever go away, and you'll have to keep yourselves up-to-date on the current regulations. Note that NY appears to be a much safer bet for August and beyond: https:/…maine"
"I am calling your bluff-you don't much care about vacationing in Maine. This last post shows that you just want to espouse your political commentary. Stay in Georgia with your own, live your life down there, and don't spread your rhetoric on travel sites since travel is not your real agenda!"
"Jac p, if your comments were aimed at me (I'm guessing they were since you mentioned Georgia and I'm the only one I've seen here posting from that locale), you are dead wrong in every sense possible.After having to cancel a trip to Yosemite for earlier this month when I'd been planning for such since autumn last year, our very first thought was let's try for Acadia and Maine this autumn instead. If you took the time to read other posts on this forum, you'd see I have detailed plans for this trip already in the works, including already booking my lodging and rental car. The only thing we've yet to book for our Maine vacation is our flights.I do not in any way just want to ""espouse my political commentary"" in the least! I want to come to Maine this September and have a wonderful time. Just because I don't believe in all this ""shut down the country"" nonsense, and that all this is strictly political at its roots, doesn't mean we don't want to come and enjoy ourselves in a beautiful location.However, if the state of Maine wants to turn away business in one of it's main industries for its peak time of year, I guess it will have to live with the consequences, and we WILL go somewhere else and spend our money there instead.Now, if anyone can suggest rational and logical travel information and facts, I'll be glad to receive the information. We plan to arrive via Bangor Airport on Sept. 19th and stay in Bar Harbor until the 26th. We plan to spend several days in and around Acadia and MDI for photography and hiking, as well as driving the coast for some lighthouse visits. As for the statistics quoted by TomMalley about 7000 new cases daily in Maine by September, if you really believe those numbers, I have some swamp land in the Smoky Mtns. I'd like to sell you."
"""Now if anyone can suggest rational and logical travel information and facts""....For mid-September? I don't know how anyone can do that right now. We don't know what's going to happen in July and August. The governor of Maine has already stated that the ""stay at home"" order could re-surface if and when Maine sees a major uptick in virus infections or just a shortage of ICU beds. P.S. The ""statistics"" were just projections by the University of Washington, and they have changed those projections drastically since they were first posted on June 12th. Current projection for Maine has the curve flattening and staying flat but that could change. Current projection for the state of Georgia however is for between 10,000 and 20,000 new infections per day in September....so don't make any non-cancellable travel plans, you may want to stay the heck out of airports in September....and Maine will definitely want you to quarantine upon arrival. As for ""all this shut-down the country nonsense""., it seems to me that making decisions based on the advice of scientists and doctors is a much better way to deal with a pandemic than ""wishful thinking"". Or are you calling this ""nonsense"" based on facts of some kind? P.S. the guidelines come from your White House, www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/"
"Kat Cubs FanI don’t think Maine or any other state for that matter “wants” to turn away business, why would they??This is a once in a lifetime (or two) PANDEMiC and the government has to make hard decisions.I’m wearing masks, staying away from people outside my family and listening to the scientists first, mainly because I want to do this once and do it right. I hate living this way but I understand why it’s necessary and I try not to whine too much about it.In the meantime, I too am making plans to travel and dreaming about spending lots of my tourist dollars in Maine when it’s time, it’s my favorite place in the world."
"The president of our country, who once said this was ""like a flu"" and would be gone by Easter...has since prohibited all travel into the U.S. from Brazil. I don't see why so many seem to think it odd that a state like Maine, with a very low infection rate, would also do whatever it could to discourage travel into the state from covid-ridden areas of the country and the world."
"Personally, we can't wait to spend a week hiking and biking and kayaking in Bar Harbor starting July 4th...even if we could only dine outside or make family meals in the downtown cottage we rented. I actually hope crowds are down so I can give my teen daughters an even more bucolic experience.FYI, I am not aware that Hancock County has any dining restrictions remaining in place - just a question of the decisions restaurateurs are making. In Portland, some owners have emphasized takeout and outdoor dining and don't plan to reopen their indoor dining at 50% capacity, especially smaller places. Biggest issue that I am currently aware of here in Maine is staffing - the bone-headed Federal unemployment benefit raises the unemployed's wages to up to $26/hr, making it such that rural workers, where prevailing wages and cost of living are lower, become (temporarily) better off not going back to work. In a state where 1 in 7 work in hospitality, the governor has throttled the ability of business owners to generate revenue during the already-short tourist season - such workers will likely have less businesses to return to next year if the tourists don't come this year. When eating out, be grateful and expect slow service, yet tip well (even takeout) - such workers are taking a risk and have lost weeks/months of income.So I say come to Maine - I can certainly empathize with the increased risk of those with pre-existing health conditions or over the age of 60 - if that were me, I'd hesitate to travel this year, keep your money in state. If you live in the NYC metro area that has been the epicenter of the outbreak, don't be a stereotypical New Yorker - be courteous and don't travel unless tested (only 0.6% of Americans and 2% of NYers have tested positive, so probability is on your side, but be an individually responsible human, get tested now, buy trip insurance, then get tested within 72 hours of travel). Always wear a mask where the locals shop and if a retail shop owner chooses to request all patrons to wear one, respect their risk management - it's your choice not to go in if you don't want to wear one.PS: Gov. Mills has admitted the 14-day quarantine is effectively unenforceable - some NYers and Bostonians who work remotely or retired are already here.Edited: 6:54 am, June 19, 2020 "
"""the governor has throttled the ability of business owners""I think the pandemic did that, not Maine's governor. Indeed there are several states that re-opened too early and now have businesses that will be suffering a lot more than the businesses in Maine. The Carolinas may never recover. And how, really, do we weigh the ""benefits"" of keeping businesses open when it means that more of our nurses have to die?"
"We are of fortunate that of our millions of health care professionals, including my sister, a critical care nurse in Anchorage, AK, very, very few have succumbed to the disease, estimated at but HUNDREDS GLOBALLY. But just as she doesn't fear going to work everyday, let us not ourselves live in fear. By all means, take Individual Responsibility to follow the recommendations I posted below, to get tested before traveling or don't travel if at greater risk - yet I am confident that all of us as Individuals can assess their own risks (or lack thereof). It was in such a spirit that I listened to others, then chose to leave the tourist resort zones, rented a car, drove responsibly, and visited the Dominican Republic's remote, but beautiful Samana Peninsula...and have returned again and again. I can think of no better place to get away from it all right now than Maine, just as our ancestors sent their families away from the heat and disease of cities to the country in past generations - I myself have been walking around and enjoying takeout in Portland for months, XC skied and hiked all over Maine's mountains, sat inside Sunday River Brewing Company soon after the owner opened in protest, enjoyed multiple Portland area beaches and just had my first 2 1/2 lobster of the seasonat Five Islands Lobster Co on a beautiful near-summer day, knowing full well that of Maine's 1,345,000 residents there have been:- only 2,610 confirmed cases (0.2% of the population); nearly 2,500 of these have been in Maine's 3 southern coastal counties...and only 14 in Hancock County, where Bar Harbor resides- only 333 hospitalizations (0.02% of the population); the average daily load STATEWIDE is but 3- only 102 deaths (0.0075% of the population), a supermajority over the age of 70 and half who resided in nursing homes and thus were already end-of-life.Off to brunch, the beach and drinks with self-responsible friends..."
"Thank you for your positive spirit! (and as a fellow healthcare worker, thank you to your sister). One of the difficulties is that we are still in the first wave of this virus. Florida and North Carolina aren't in their second wave - they are still in their first. It's possible that another wave could be even worse. I don't live in fear. I live with vigilance. I can't imagine going through what we've been through already another time. (I live in Upstate NY) My children are essential employees. I do worry for them. Stay well."
"""Only 102 deaths"".....yeah because the state shut down (had more warning than poor Rhode Island did) and because the vast majority of people stayed home instead of prancing off to Sunday River Brewing Company trying to make some kind of a statement. ""Only 102 deaths""....yeah but unfortunately death is not the only outcome, suffering with lung damage for the rest of your life does not sound like any fun either. No better place to get away than Maine? So you are opposed to the government's ban on travel in from Brazil? Let the Brazilians escape to Maine this summer?"
"Just for the record this statement: ""a supermajority over the age of 70 and half who resided in nursing homes and thus were already end-of-life."" is very insensitive. Just because a 70+ year old has less years ahead of him or her than a 40 year old, doesn't mean one need be cavalier about ending that life gasping for breath, intubated, and heavily drugged on a ventilator. In any case, the majority of virus cases in Maine have been in people under 50."
"Interesting to read your post...we are from HHI and are currently in Maine. We left HH beginning of June to travel in Maine in our RV. HHI (SC in general has Seen huge spike since we left...much due to our states early reopening). I have been very impressed with the restrictions up here but have to say no restaurants/attractions have restricted us due to being out of state. We have our mask and have respected all rules. We have quarantined and are traveling with only our family of 4 and dog in a camper and only ate at 3 outdoor restaurants in the last 3 weeks. If you have a Maine trip scheduled, don’t cancel. You can do a covid test within 72 hrs of arrival to Maine and exempt the Quarantine (at least as of July 1st) but some of our campgrounds have accepted that as of now."
"So, assuming I'll be able to get a test and negative results within 72 hours of flying to Bangor for my trip (very unlikely I'll be able to do this, but if I could), what about getting exposed and contracting the virus at the three airports I'll be traveling through, not to mention the two planes I'll be traveling on to get there? How's a negative test 3 days ahead of time going to help that?Most folks in our area who are testing positive at this time are asymtomatic and have no idea they have the virus. I could be one of those after contact in the airports or on the plane. Assuming I can get tested and results back that quickly, what if I test positive two days before leaving? Too late to change plans/cancel flights most likely, so what then? Loose my money on flights and hotel?I still feel this is useless to require testing this soon before arrival if the real possibility of contracting while traveling is high.Maybe by September, things will be easing up somewhat, but maybe not."
"And what would be a better plan? Just let everyone come? Everything you said is true and it's why many people are canceling or not making travel plans this summer, especially by air.. It's way less risky for you and for Maine to just stay home."
"If restrictions don't lift more or if they re-tighten, I may have no choice, but I'm coming if it's allowed. I just think these regulations are pointless if exposure can happen prior to arrival in any timeframe. We've already cancelled one trip this year to California and Yosemite, and Bar Harbor is our back-up trip for the year. I don't plan on cancelling another one."
"It's not pointless. That's like saying it's pointless to wear a seat belt in your car on the way to the airport. After all, your plane might crash, you might fall off a cliff on a hiking trail, you might get run over crossing a busy street. With the testing regulation in place, at least Maine knows you weren't infected when you started out on your trip."

Hopefully you won't have to quarantine when you return from your trip. Boothbay is gorgeous - one of our favorite places!!
"You say you quarantined while in Maine, but then say that you went into shops, restaurants, etc."
"We’ve been grappling with our travel plans to York in mid July, but we’re going to take the risk and get tested and bring the compliance forms. We’re both essential workers so we are not quarantined, but knock on wood we are both healthy. I feel for the sake of my mental health I need to get out of NYC and be in a beautiful place. We were considering Montreal. I am Canadian, but my fiancé is not. Maine seemed more realistic, but not so sure anymore. Just keeping toes and fingers crossed!"
"Are there some new mandates in the past few days I've not heard about visitors to Maine? I've been away from the computer and the news.Still planning to come to Bar Harbor in September.Edited: 11:06 am, July 01, 2020 "
yeshttps:/…index.shtml
"There has just been a change: Residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will now be treated the same as those from New Hampshire and Vermont. They are not required to quarantine and/or get the test due to low positivity numbers in those states. I believe this starts Friday, but please check maine.gov for the details.Also - be prepared to put your mask on in the coastal towns and larger ""cities"" in Maine. People have had enough with the violations, so Governor Mills is making it a bigger deal.Details are here:https://wgme.com/news/coronavirus/gov-mills-…Edited: 2:28 pm, July 01, 2020 "
"Just hoping they don't put any travel prohibitions based on certain states between now and September!! My state has tons of cases mounting up, but not in my rural area where it's been very limited thankfully. It's Atlanta and some areas of south Georgia where the big spikes have been, and I think it's very unfair to judge an entire state based on regional problems within that state.My traveling partner is from Tennessee, and again, it's been bad there in certain areas, but NOT in the area near where he lives.We booked our flights today, so being very optimistic for our trip!!Edited: 3:03 pm, July 01, 2020 "
"Hello all, Just wanted to provide some info —-My family ( from R.I.) are in Bar Harbor now for a short vacation. We did get tested before we came (all negative). We wanted to come and support all the businesses we have loved to visit over the years. It is quiet but lovely. Everyone is wearing a mask and social distancing. The restaurants have plenty of outdoor seating and our favorite hotel - West Street- has gone all out to make sure their guests are safe and comfortable. We are enjoying ourselves and happy we came."
"""I think it's very unfair to judge an entire state""Maybe so, but it's *practical*. And I can just imagine the noise from the idiots who show up without masks to whine about things if states were trying to devote resources to enacting restrictions based on county or township.https:/…"

"Oh come on Steve. I'm in the Finger Lakes where its stage 3 isiting family. NYC is in Stage 1. Dividing up the state is totally appropriate. I'm coming from Northern VA where we thanks to taking it seriously things are much better.

"""Dividing up the state is totally appropriate.""You know the subject is quarantines for people from out of state, right? It's far easier to enforce rules simply based on the state than to enforce them based on regions or counties."
We are looking for a rental just not sure what type and where in Bar Harbor. Who did you deal with?
Bulldog: I sent you a private message
Bulldog: we are long-time renters on Mt Desert Island. Not sure if you are looking at hotels or rental homes. We have used VRBO and also local real estate agents who handle summer rentals. We've found the real estate agents to be most helpful in locating homes to rent that met our interests and needs.
"I have a trip booked end of month. I’m from MA & Unfortunately, I think we’re going to cancel & go to VT instead. I don’t want to have to set up a test & worry about getting results in time. We wear masks in public & have zero positive cases in our area right now. Hoping maybe something will change in the next week but if not, we’ll plan a trip to VT instead. We were looking to do a small yoga retreat in Aug in Maine as well. But we just booked in NH instead. Really bummed. Had wanted to visit Acadia for years.Edited: 8:13 am, July 07, 2020 "
"As for using VRBO or a real estate agent when looking for rentals, just be cautious about using Craigslist. Every year there are scams where people lose large deposits on rentals that are stolen. Someone uses the pictures from a real rental and books a week in a home that they don't actually own. I know of two cases like that already this year."
"In agreement, Bonnie - I would never use Craigslist for a rental. I prefer using the local real estate agents as they are reputable and knowledgeable about the area and the properties they represent."
"What is the current COVID situation in Maine. We're planning to come either the weekend of Labor Day or right after. We are coming from CT and now have the lowest #'s in the country from what I understand. We had planned a trip to come in May, but ended up cancelling because of COVID. Hoping to be able to come in September."
"Please pardon my lack of knowledge about this situation, but I am planning a trip to Maine because quarantine has been lifted... but I guess that depends on the state you're coming from? Do I need to scrap my plans too? I will double check Maine's tourism site now I guess."
"Residents of Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut do not need to quarantine or provide a recent negative Covid test to visit Maine at this time. All other states need to do one or the other."
"If you have proof of a negative covid test 72 hours prior to your arrival, you don’t have to quarantine."
I am planning a trip to Bar Harbor during that time. Can you please give me the rental agency? Is there a min stay?
"There are a number of real estate agencies all over the island - you can do a Google search for Mt Desert Island real estate agencies. Once on their web pages, click on 'vacation rentals'. In the summer season, most homes book on a weekly basis. Difficult to say with the circumstances this year, but some who own vacation homes might consider renting for less than that period of time if they currently have openings. The real estate agent can assist you with that."
