"Back before the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy was called (I'm in Italy under lockdown at the moment) we had booked a trip to Malta. Ryan Air canceled our flight due to the virus. We thought we would take the ferry from Sicily instead, but then the Italian lockdown was announced. Now, granted, we did book a hotel with a no-cancellation policy (not ever doing that again) and when I sent a cancellation to them through Booking.com I asked if they might reconsider the no-cancellation policy considering the circumstances. They replied that they would not make an exception and I should ask Ryan Air to refund the hotel cost. Then Malta closed its borders to Italy and anyone from Italy trying to get into Malta would be hit with a €1000 fine. I emailed them again and pointed out that even if we could get out of Italy we would be fined by their government. Their reply? ""I understand your situation but you have bought a non refundable fare"" I would say, if you are planning a trip to Malta and there is any chance whatsoever of your trip being interrupted DO NOT book with the Isola del Mar Hotel."
"Bit harsh, for how is one supposed to check into a hotel if one cannot even access the country said hotel is in?Personally I think as I have said in numerous postings, and lambasted for in the main (but someone has to adopt a common sense stance) all these very draconian measures of population movement have been adopted very quickly, and no doubt legislation will be slow to catch up.I would hope that, in due course these hotels will be forced to give refunds , due to these unprecedented and rather annoying circumstances we find ourselves in."
"Hopefully this should be covered by your holiday insurance, together with any additional expense as a result of your extended stay in Italy. I’m sorry that your trip to Europe has been so negatively impacted.I only ever book non refundable hotels last minute, when there is no chance of cancellation since I have been stung in the past. Flexible rates are more expensive, but offer some peace of mind. Yes the rules are very draconian."
I bet that this hotel won`t be the only one to stick to their no refund rules . many others will do it. Graham
"If we knowingly book non-redundable bookings, we run the risk of losing our money. Rooms are often at a discounted rate.It's all very annoying but they are a business.I've been burnt recently but thankfully it wasn't too expensive.Edited: 6:58 am, March 12, 2020 "
I often book non refundable rooms when I book cheap Travelodge or Premier Inn last minute rooms but would always book refundable for expensive rooms a long time ahead. Graham
"Do you have travel insurance, if so contact them, you should be covered, if you paid by credit card contact them, as some will refund you in cases like this, as there insurance covers them.A privately owned hotel on Malta doing this, dosent suprise me to be honest, it may be worth checking with the maltese government also, as they may of made a temporary law to cover tourists who have had cancel due to them closing there borders to Italy, but let's be honest travel insurance is all ways needed when travelling abroad hopefully you've taken it out and they will refund you, hopefully. Eileen"
I hope you are right Eileen but insurance companies try anything to avoid paying out. They may say this is an act of God . Graham
"Graham depends how good insurance they've got, ours covers natural disasters such as volcanic Ash etc, it also covers things like this, but it's not cheap as we had to add it on, but too me we did it as its better to be able to get the thousands back you pay for a holiday, than nothing at all, swine flu and volcanic Ash taught me this, A friend got caught in both, and lost thousands due to it.Our basic insurance is free with my bank it comes free with my account, but I've paid to add things on, disasters etc, upped medical and money and luggage, so I know if its still going on in September when we're due to go on holiday and say if Malta or UK went into lock down, I'd get every penny back. Eileen"
"Graham Just to add your correct tho, lots are refusing now to cover it, or too pay out.Eileen"
That comes as no surprise . Graham
"That's true Graham, it was similar with swine and bird flu, but it may seem they may make it a permanent thing not paying out or covering epidemics/pandemics, as it said on the News the insurance companies were meeting with regulators to change it.Eileen"
