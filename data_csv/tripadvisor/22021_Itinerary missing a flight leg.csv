"Trying to figure out if our Latam flight from LAX to Lima is cancelled for June 1st. When I try to check ""my trips"" on the Latam website it shows the leg from Seattle to LAX then from Lima back to LAX and LAX back to SEA but no flight from LAX to Lima.... I checked and they are booking flights for that day so I'm not sure why it is not showing. My original email confirming my trip has the flight on it so it was not just an oops...forgot to book.... I wish they would just tell us whether the flight is cancelled or not without having to wait until just a couple days before we were supposed to travel! Any ideas?"
The Peruvian government has said that international flights will continue to remain cancelled during June and July. I'm not sure why airlines are still selling tickets for those months. I've heard of people buying tickets for June/July without checking the news first and now they don't know what to do.
Is there a website that we can verify this? I am having a hard time finding any info re Peru border closure.Thank you
