"I have a 2 week holiday to Sardinia (Isola Rossa, in the worst affected Sardinian province) booked departing 13th June, due to Coronavirus/Covid19 I'm contemplating postponing till 12th September, is there a lot more rain in September than in June? I know that July & August are the driest months but I was wondering how June & September compare. I really don't want to wait till June 2021, & I have a holiday to somewhere else booked for March - so those holidays would be very close together (well by my standards anyway)."
"I have found the later part of September to be wonderful. Good weather and smaller crowds, if that matters anymore. I look forward to crowds in Italy."
I am not a fan of crowds - one of the reasons I don't holiday in July/August aswell as the higher costs.
"July and August its holiday time for Italians 30 days, they mostly flock down south to the beach it's very hot and humid for me in the north big cities, did you cancel Cuba? but I would wait to hold off on booking anything for Italy at this time for your dates there on full lockdown, who knows when they open for tourism."
I am going to Cuba in March 2021.
September is possibly the best month out of the twelve for a holiday in Sardinia. Fewer Italians with kids around good smooth weather ( normally ) and most important to me less wind at the beach.
"My favorite time in Sadinia is sóend of May and beginning of June. Visited the Island many times but only once in September. That is actually the same for weather temperature, but the only difference is the vegetation: At the beginning of June everything is so fresh, all plants, flowers blooming, there is everywhere the scent of jasmin..etc. However at the present situation you can not know if it would be possible to travel in June... Well, we aslo have tickets for the 10th of June. Bought in last November, but not yet booked hotel, who knows..."
"Well I have postponed till 12th September, TUI announced that they were waiving the £50 per person amendment fee for holidays departing before 30th June which a) is good value and b) the fact that they're doing that leads me to believe that they very much doubt holidays before July starts will happen."
""" doubt holidays before July starts will happen""Me too :(No worries for yourself, mid Sept is a great time of year here.( Although like Szofi76, my fave month in Sardinia is June but sea temps can still be a tad nippy for some then)"
"yes hoping that September will be okay...want to wait till really safe and before the ""next wave"" which most say will come with winter 2020/2021. Until a tested and effective vaccine is available travel will be risky."
"I don't think tourism will be possible in Italy this year.First of all Sardinia is not only in lock down as the rest of Italy, but nobody can currently reach the island without a permit from the Autonomous Region Government and it's allowed only for residents and for family, medical and work purposes.In addition i think that the next step that will do Italy when the epidemic ends (before the rest of the world) is probably blocking the access of people from abroad, as China is doing now, to avoid new epidemic outbreaks inside the country.Edited: 12:16 am, March 27, 2020 "
