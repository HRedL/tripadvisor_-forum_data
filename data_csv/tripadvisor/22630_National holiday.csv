"Hi we are travelling to Budapest fri 13- until Monday 16th and i believe Sunday is a national holiday. Can anyone advise if there will be shops, galleries etc open on this day or do most places close? Thanks"
"Shops, stores, supermarkets will be closed. Museum, galleries will be usually open, and in some museums there is a free entry on the national holiday."
"Usually open, but given that the coronavirus just started spreading in Hungary I wouldnt be surprised if the museums will get closed and not only on the 15th.The celebrations have been already cancelled.https:/â€¦"
"More and more.olaces are staying open. If there is a specific.place.you want to go, you should call. Family run places are.often closed on holidays."
Thanks for the info
