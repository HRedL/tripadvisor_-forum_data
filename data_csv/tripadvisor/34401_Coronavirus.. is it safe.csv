Am travelling with my 2yr lo and 60 yr old mom... I am travelling from India.. Is it safe to travel considering coronavirus... I know it has not orginated in Singapore but 3 has been identified and wandering in the city.. Any suggestions for places to avoid?
Stay at home is the safest.
"No one is ""wandering in the city"" as you out it, they are hospitalised. The rest of us are just continuing as per usual. Ministry of Health advice is to maintain good hygenie practices by washing hands etc: https://www.moh.gov.sg/2019-ncov-wuhanEdited: 5:44 am, January 25, 2020 "
"No one can say what your chances are since you will come in contact with travellers from other countries and who knows who they have come into contact with. With an elderly and a young one, I would avoid unnecessary air travel at the moment.Edited: 8:00 am, January 25, 2020 "
"Flying is perfectly “safe” until......... if one stops to rationalise every part of life, we’d never leave home. How can anyone tell. For example over 600 people die, on average, from “flu” every year in the U.K. does that stop visiting numbers, do most people even think about it? I doubt it and rightly so."
"It is a personal decision. To put things in perspective, flu is preventable by having updated vaccinations whereas there is no vaccine currently for the coronavirus."
"None of us have the expertise to give a definite answer, and the situation is changing daily.Staying at home may be the safest option, but we have no idea how far this will spread, so who knows.If you decide to come, practice good hygiene procedures, washing hands carefully before eating.As yet, it looks as if you need an extended period in contact with an infected person to catch the disease, but this could change if the virus mutates.In the end, it's your choice."
"Hello Compass! I would suggest you monitor the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Singapore Ministry of Health websites for updates and tips. The news has reported a case in Singapore’s Sentosa Island however the hotel has taken steps to disinfect the room. Rest assured, the Singaporean government and hospitality industry is taking precaution. In the mean time, practice good hygiene such as washing hands regularly, do not touch your face, wear a mask and stay away from wild animals and livestock markets. I wish you safe travels."
"Heaps of people wearing face masks here, bring them with you as they are selling out here."
"being from Perth Aus, when you say ""here"" do you refer to Aus or Singapore ?"
"Masks are selling out in Singapore. If you havent left yet i would advise buying before you leave. Were taking surgical masks, hand sanitiser and antibacterial wipes. Can never be too prepared!"
Singapore.. heaps of people at Changi Airport wearing masks
"Masks are sold out everywhere in Singapore but suppliers are trying hard to replenish. Problem is a lot of the replenished stocks are purchased by Chinese (sending them back to China). Singapore situation is still ok as there are 4 cases but all quarantine. Another 92 are quarantine. Accordingly to some experts, it is not easy to transmit from human to human (don’t know how true)Nowhere is safe since many Chinese are already everywhere...."
"Thank you, Mllycolly we wish you a safe trip. Would appreciate a brief report on your return on the situation in Singapore from a visitors perspective and how concerned people are becoming.Edited: 4:09 pm, January 27, 2020 "
"Travelandunwind. Thank you for your information. Your comment that it does not seem to be passed from human to human goes along with what is being seen in Aus. The people who are sick are those that have arrived from Wuhan. So ""how""is it being transmitted. I am starting to wonder if they should be testing the water in China , surely all these people could not have eaten at the seafood market."
"From what I have read so far and based on the numbers published in China, human to human transmission is present. However I believe the conditions in Wuhan is rather bad with limited medical support and supplies (no one know the real true). I had friends in China as I have previously worked there. Many said the situation is very bad especially in 2nd/ 3 tier cities with many avoiding outdoor activities. I guess situation in China is already quite serious hence coronavirus is spreading like wildfire. Once it hits 2700+ (current numbers reported in the press), it is almost beyond control. Some suggested the winter situation is not helping in this epidemic. Singapore at the currently moment is still well controlled. No Singapore in close contact has shown any symptoms which is pretty positive. Government has also setup necessary precautions to isolate close contacts. No one knows the situation moving forward. Experts shared that you need close contact (example: in planes with long duration) for human to human transmission. No one knows the answer. Some suggested this virus can spread before symptom. When this happen, I think it maybe unstoppable. Can only wait to see how things progress"
"Thank you, TravelandUnwind very informative . We are heading to the UK via Singapore and then having a 5 day holiday on the way back in Singapore. Not going until late May, but becoming increasingly concerned, considering the time frame sitting on a plane, and the rapid spread of this virus."
"If you are on a plane, try to book upper deck of the A380 (some flights have economy seats on upper deck on a 2 x 4 x 2 seating configuration. Can try to put on a mask as precaution."
"Hi, our government and everyone is also taking precautions in Singapore although there isn't much infected so far as I know, consider safe to visit our country I should say. I wear mask everywhere I go and I am still feeling ok. Enjoy your trip!!"
I'm going to Singapore in 10 days on a business trip... will have to stay there for 6 days … 2 of which will be at fairs with few-ten thousands people in sort of closed spaces … I'm a bit more than worried right now. Really don't think I should go. Any thoughts? I won't be able to practice good hygiene in that kind of situation and definitely will be in a super crowded place for extended of time.
"Obviously only you can make the decision to go or not go, and no one can predict the future. That said, as of now neither we nor our kids are wearing masks or have made any changes to our activities. I don't feel concerned.You should check with your company re any travel restrictions. At the moment mine is only saying that travel to China requires prior approval - no other restrictions on travel within Asia.But ultimately you should stick with what you feel comfortable with."
"Everyone's kinda spooked (my sister texted me this morning saying she saw MRT commuters quickly moving away from a coughing passenger on the train).But the current reality is there's still no domestic transmission here as yet. Those who became sick were all Wuhanese after they reached Singapore. They were asymptomatic on the plane (the thermal scanners would've otherwise detected them), didn't affect other flight passengers (the contact tracing would've otherwise connected the dots), didn't affect any local or foreigner while in town (we're quarantining high-risk close contacts as a precaution). FYI Our health authorities have defined 3 tiers of possible exposure: the high-risk (typically family members & travelling companions) who were in close proximity (2m) for longer periods (over 30 min); the moderate-risk (typically service staff who interacted with the infected) who weren't in close proximity for longer periods; & transient contacts (other pedestrians or commuters) who had walked past the infected in public. The 1st tier are physically quarantined; the 2nd tier are subject to daily phone monitoring for 14 days (& advised to see a doctor if unwell); the 3rd tier are reminded to practice personal hygiene (washing hands regularly, wearing a mask if coughing) as with normal flu prevention.At the moment, only 3 Asian countries (Vietnam, Japan, Taiwan) have currently reported coronavirus patients who didn't visit China prior, of which only the Japanese case (a tour bus driver) wasn't a family member. None of them are ""super spreaders"" yet, nor have there been any fatalities outside China.But the WHO has now declared the Wuhan virus outbreak an international health emergency, so it's better to obey any corresponding travel advisory issued by your home country. Unsurprisingly, the virus has now spread to every China province, given how 400 million migrant workers were heading home during the ongoing week-long CNY holidays over there. (Here's the daily escalation chart from Jan 22 to 30 if you haven't seen it https://i.imgur.com/a/wLMr0bG ) At the same time, China has banned all outbound group travel since Jan 27 &, adding the 2-week virus incubation window, the hope is to break the chain of overseas transmission by Feb 11 or so. It won't be easy, given the scale, possible virus mutation, people slipping through the cracks, & foreign countries suffering their own coronavirus outbreaks. Touch wood.If you're attending trade fairs here, try to find out if the organizers have prepared thermal scanners to screen people at the venues. As of Jan 29, Singapore has also imposed travel restrictions (mandatory quarantining, stopping visa issues, disallowing entry/transit) on all travelers from Hubei. But this doesn't cover all visitors from China as yet. So if the trade fairs have Chinese exhibition booths, check with the organizers if they've taken extra precaution (eg. verify the exhibitors' travel history, medical clearance, etc.). If the MRT anecdote is any indication, a lot of people is going to play safe & avoid close contact."
"The New York TimesThe State Department tells Americans not to go to China.The State Department on Thursday night issued a travel advisory telling Americans not to travel to China because of the public health threat posed by the dangerous new coronavirus. The department set the new advisory at Level 4, or red — its highest alert, reserved for the most perilous situations.“Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice,” the State Department said. “Commercial carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China.”"
"Well, I'll be in Singapore between 7th and 9th Feb and I'm a little concerned about it but I guess we just need to be sensible and not to panic too much (it's not on red alert....yet) - wash your hands thoroughly, take some antibacterial wipes and wear a mask"
Advice is masks if you are unwell to stop spread not wearing to prevent infection. Other measures like good hygiene more effective to prevent infection.
"Here's the current breakdown of the infected cases here, for perspective.01 66M Jan 20 (was with 03)02 53F Jan 21 (was with 13)03 37M Jan 20 (was with 01)04 36M Jan 22 (was with 11)05 56F Jan 18 06 56M Jan 19 07 45M Jan 23 08 56F Jan 19 (was with 09)09 56M Jan 19 (was with 08)10 56M Jan 20 11 31F Jan 22 (was with 04)12 37F Jan 22 13 73F Jan 21 (was with 02)14 47F Jan 30 (part of 92 SG evacuated)15 31M Jan 26 16 38M Jan 22 China banned outbound group travel on Jan 27.Singapore banned/restricted inbound travel from Hubei (epicentre) on Jan 28.Singapore banned/restricted inbound travel from all of China on Jan 31.The WHO emergency declaration, while non-binding, usually prompts more-cautious governments to take further discretionary measures, & Singapore has indeed done precisely that since my last post yesterday.My thoughts (optimistically):- There's still no local transmission/community spread here yet. All 16 were imported cases: asymptomatic (i.e. not sick) during the flight, symptomatic after arriving & promptly isolated.- The Singaporean (1st local infected case) was among the batch of 92 emergency evacuees on a specially-arranged flight after China imposed its travel ban. She become sick after landing, so all those on the same flight would be isolated/quarantined.- Other than her, the most recent imported case landed here on Jan 26. Touch wood, there's been no new infected arrival since then, after China & then Singapore basically started closing borders.- We're now cautiously managing the 14-day virus incubation period of those who arrived here before those cut-off dates, as well as the relevant close contacts (mandatory quarantining for those high-risk exposure; daily phone monitoring for those medium-risk exposure).- 8 of the 16 infected cases here were traveling family companions. They haven't spread the virus to any ""outsiders"" yet (local or foreign) as yet.- The most multiple cases (12 of the 16) happened between Jan 19 & 22. The earliest (13th) was on Jan 18. If nothing adverse happens, the close contacts involved with those arrivals will start being released from quarantine after this weekend."
"@ compass what did u decide ? I too traveling with a 2 yr old and 2 elderly to Australia, transmitting through Singapore. So confused and worried right now as what to do! Leaving on feb 3rd"
"Singapore is now not allowing anybody from China to transit through the airport, or enter Singapore, although you might encounter a few leaving the country.The UK government has decided that they only consider the risk of infection if somebody has been within 2m of an infected person for 15 minutes or more (I personally think you need to be close for a much longer period)Your only possible risk is if somebody has spent a few days in Singapore without showing any symptoms, sits near you on the plane, and then develops the infection.In the end it's up to you."
I wouldn't worry about it - take normal precaution. More people die from the flu each year.
"Life doesn’t change much in Singapore. Some people wear masks on public transport, malls or on the street. Government encourage us to wear mask if we are unwell only. People are paying more attention to personal hygiene such as washing hands with soap frequently. Chingay parade (annual activity during Chinese New Year) continued as per schedule( 31 Jan and 1 Feb). It drew around 12k-16k spectators(ticket holders) and 6k volunteers each day. Many believe government allowed such event because there is no local/ community spread of Coronavirus in Singapore.If you do come to Singapore, just put more attention on personal hygene."

"OK guys. I just got back to England a couple of hours ago from Singapore. My hotel was really close to Chinatown, not far from China Point shopping mall and the MRT. Yes I have seen many wearing masks but I've come back feeling fine. Yes I did wear a mask at times in Singapore especially in crowded areas such as MRT, tourist areas and Chinatown and wash my hands regularly, and carried antibacterial liquids with me. Just take the necessary precautions and you'll be fine.Edited: 6:01 am, February 11, 2020 "
"@ TopKingofKings - delighted you’re home safely and that you had an exciting time!Get the latest updates herehttps://www.moh.gov.sg/Edited: 6:09 am, February 11, 2020 "
"Thanks for the link BillI heard the number of cases were growing in Singapore while I was there for 3 days but it is a small number in comparison. If there were maybe well over 1000 people infected with the virus in Singapore, I would consider cancelling it. At the moment, I feel the risk is low but that could change in a few weeksEdited: 6:26 am, February 11, 2020 "
"TopKingOfKingsLet’s hope the growth trend declines! Why would there be more cases in Singapore than Hong Kong?Edited: 6:52 am, February 11, 2020 "
"There is a very simple explanation. Due to the protests in HK, many mainland Chinese were not welcome in HK so they avoided travelling to HK."
"That explains it minxbaby.I was close to Chinatown - I stayed at Holiday Inn Express which is a few minutes to China Point close to Chinatown MRT and I did see many people in masks but then again I did see as many people wearing masks at Heathrow T4 departure before I flew to Doha, then Krabi in Thailand then onto Singapore. I didn't wear a mask in Krabi but used it a lot more in Singapore when I needed to, especially in crowded areas but I took it off in areas that were less crowded - just use common sense and carry a small actibacterial liquid to use frequently.About 6 weeks ago during the XMAS break I went to Saudi Arabia with my family and came back just before the New Year with a nasty virus but that has now cleared just before I went to Thailand and Singapore. Even with the virus I had in Saudi didn't prevent me from going to Singapore and Thailand - the risks of catching any kind of virus in Saudi is far higher as you get people from all over the globe bringing these viruses with them."
One thing that still intrigues me.I have read reports this evening that 2 unfotunate patients have been discharged from quarantine after failing to exhibit any continuing signs and symptoms for several days.All good and well but didn't the recent carriers also fail to show symptoms but all the while they were contageous and unaware to authorities.Let us hope that those recovered are well and truly free of the virus and not unwittingly carriers.

"I just watched one of the video's you kindly provided. He refers to Hawker markets - get in and get out and go home . What about Bay of gardens, and the light shows on Sentosa ?? they are just as busy if not more so ?"
"We've eaten several times in hawker centres in the last few days. We always sit at the edge to minimise infection risk.We agree the ideal is to take the food away, but that's not often practical for tourists.GBTB is a lot quieter than normal, and there are almost no tour groups. There are temperature checks as you enter the domes, and inside you're in a huge area, so I reckon they're quite safe.Edited: 7:28 pm, February 12, 2020 "

Thank you. You have eased my worries. Arriving in Singapore Monday for a 10 day cruise and will be staying in Singapore for 2 days at the end of the cruise. Are most of the attractions still open?
"planning to go there to in the 21st. Was planning to cancel but our flight, hotel and attraction tickets are nonrefundable. And reading from people's posts, it's not so bad. So far upon checking the Facebook pages of the attractions, they have statements saying they are open with precautionary measures being taken. Hopefully nothing changes over the next few days :)"

"All attractions are open. USS have reduced opening hours,Marina barrage has turned off all water features, but that won't affect most visitors.Some shops and restaurants on Sentosa have reduced their opening hours.Those are the only changes I know about.The good news is that attractions are a lot quieter than usual, making them more fun.At Resorts World we used to have to queue 5 minutes for a taxi back to our hotel at 10pm, now there's a long line of taxis.So in many ways, you can have a great time here."
We have been here for 7 days and leaving to go home tomorrow. We have been careful and the tourist numbers being down there are no queues. Taxi Drivers and hotel workers behind reception are wearing masks and so are some shop people. Mostly tourists out and about and we have managed to get to all attractions with no or very little queues Temperature checking everywhere and I feel as safe as I can feel and the restaurants and hotels are taking this very seriously and providing all the precautions they can. Sad to leave Singapore tomorrow but will be back again next year. I just feel for the people who live here who rely on tourism to support their families
