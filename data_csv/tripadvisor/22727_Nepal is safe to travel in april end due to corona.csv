Okay Thanks
Is there any one who has plan for nepal in April end around 25th April
Should I cancel my travel plans in light of the coronavirus outbreak?
"Only you can make that decision, Anuja.scoodly"
"Read the posts here from informed sources close to the action and make your own decision. If you are over 60 years of age with an immune system compromised by an existing chronic illness, then canceling might be for you.I am scheduled to fly on May 2nd from Texas to KTM via Doha. If I'm allowed to go, I'm going. It seems that the potential for forced cancellation increases with each passing week. The latest being Qatar's prohibition of travel from Nepal into Qatar. It appears - for the time being - that I will be allowed to pass through DOH as long as I don't leave the airport, which I have no plans to do. If that policy tightens to prohibit all passengers from Nepal. I'm screwed."
"RE #8: If Qatar Airways suspends service to Nepal, you could fly Turkish Airlines."
"Thanks, Ling. In flying Qatar Air business class on miles. My options are limited, but I remain cautiously optimistic."
