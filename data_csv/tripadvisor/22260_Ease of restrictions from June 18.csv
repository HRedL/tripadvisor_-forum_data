The government announced reduced restrictions from June 18 on a number of activities https://gulfnews.com/uae/government/dubai-co…
I note it states they’re allowed to operate at 100% capacity for pools & kids clubs - there seems to be mixed messages and I can’t help but feel they’re putting economics over people’s health.Not sure I’d be letting my child run free around a kids club but hey ho it’s each to their own
Yet restaurants are operating at 40% capacity!
"Realistically, most of the activities listed will not reach 100% capacity until they allow tourists back and no sign of that yet."
"Pools have the potential to become busy with staycations, ladies days and beach clubs"
"Emiratis and residents are allowed to travel abroad now but with certain guidelines to follow and adhere to such as traveling to places that are not considered dangerous to travel to, having travel insurance, testing for Covid19 before flying, quarantine after return and more. I see opening for tourist with restrictions coming probably early July! https://gulfnews.com/uae/government/uae-trav…"
"Yes Shaun, the Tawajudi has just been a nightmare. Took my daughter weeks to complete it - it's not an easy system to navigate. Hopefully though, they may have resolved some of the teething problems now (or not)."
Breaking....List of countries UAE citizens & residents can travel to from 23 June. UK not listed at low or medium...https://english.alarabiya.net/en/coronavirus…
Whilst I’m not defending The UKs appalling death toll I’m surprised to see Belgium on that list of ‘moderate’ risk as they’ve had the highest number of cases per population ratio in Europe! And their ‘R’ number is still similar to The UK. I appreciate countries measure their cases differently but some of those countries on that moderate list have similar reproduction rates as The UK so I’m intrigued by some of those on the list!
"Yes, you would think the current R rate would have been the determining factor.Bit of a blow though for UK tourists hoping to travel anytime soon."
"UK has taken over Belgium this week and now has the highest number of deaths per million.Germany reported more new infections than the UK yesterday at around 1,800 and 1,115 respectively.All countries are currently making decisions on whether or not to allow tourists on an economic rather than public health basis."
"I'd also suggest the scale of the effort is a factor too.Far easier to process say, Belgium's number of potential outbound travellers and airports than to UK. However, one look at Emirates's 'hopeful' list of outbound flights to UK destinations gives an the idea of 'hope' (relatively and cautiously mind).Overall, I think it comes down to the sequence,Sort the systemic issues with approvals >>> start filling seats on flights >>> get back the residents >>> decide on tourist protocols >> Dubai goes live again as a tourist destination.Whichever way one looks at the tissues, the root cause of the problem comes down to process.Edited: 7:55 am, June 18, 2020 "
"Being an Australian we have been advised by the travel minister yesterday that our borders will remain closed for overseas travel until sometime in 2021. (Unless approved for compassionate reasons) Was hoping to travel to Dubai in April/May next year but we may not be allowed out of the country. Think Australia and NZ looking at a travel bubble in maybe September. So even though our numbers out this way are so low we are still incredibly restricted, too keep it that way I guess. Could be much longer than people think before holidays and travel are up and going again..Sadly ..."
"This information is confusing, as Emirates have already announced they will fly to UK and flights are scheduled on their booking site."
"@ Bernie - I can see how it could be confusing, but Emirates and the routes they're actively flying to doesn't automatically mean that people can travel.Emirates were previously flying repatriation flights, and have continued flying routes for cargo also. Emirates then scheduled flights (as slots are filed months in advance) and also ramped up allowing bookings.UAE Gov last week announced protocols for travellers, then outbound residents and Emiratis can travel (subject to certain conditions).UAE Gov today confirmed the risk levels for relevant countries.So, take, for instance, yesterday. Emirates flew DXB-MAN and returned, and have started a once-weekly schedule. As it stands today, no tourists can enter Dubai from the UK and officially no-one can leave to UK from Dubai under the measures announced yesterday & today.Hope that clears up the confusion, if not try this - just because Emirates fly a route, doesn't mean people can travel on it. Which is why there will be all sorts of pressures to either 1) ease some conditions or 2)sort the backlog of approvals to allow more people to fly.."
"The U.K. may have overtaken Belgium for its death toll but The ‘R’ number remains similar Whilst the death toll in any population is horrific however small it is the number of continuing new cases and reproduction rate that should in effect determine if a country is deemed low risk.The Republic of Ireland has had 25k cases as opposed to our nearly 300k but given we have a population over 13 times larger they have had a slightly larger reproduction and ratio to U.K. yet they’re are deemed low risk! If a visitor or tourist visits a country with a high death toll such as ours it doesn’t mean they’re more likely to die but if they visit a country with a similar ‘R’ number but with a much lower death rate then they’re just as likely to catch it which to me is what should be taken into consideration. I understand what you’re saying Shaun and I don’t think The UAE should be welcoming U.K. tourists any time soon but equally I think it’s too soon to be welcoming many from the lists they’ve published. I don’t blame Australia & NZ for keeping their borders closed, the rest of the world should have done so months ago but I dare say it’s perhaps easier as they don’t have the number of people transitioning through or airports like LHR. I totally understand the economic strain, I live in The North East of England where unemployment is high to start with and my company had to furlough many staff who in all likelihood will be made redundant in coming months but I really worry that all people are bothered about is their summer holiday and we get a second peak and countries that aren’t as affected end up with high rates also and the whole thing flares up again..."
"Under promise & over deliver is not a phrase The UAE is familiar with.... Eeh Shaun - fancy having a dig at Jumeirah Janes. My Mam is the epitome of a Jumeirah Jane and is one of the originals , I’ll have to check if she’s been on Facebook although I doubt it as she spends too much time in Gerard's cafe with her Jumeirah Jane counterparts lol..."
"Hannah, I understand entirely where you're coming from. It is a very difficult controversial balancing act (economy v safety) with many countries relying on tourism but I can assure you that I am not just bothered about getting my holiday.  I am bothered about my daughter being stuck in Dubai with a new baby having to self isolate as considered vulnerable and her husband being stranded overseas without any prospect of getting a flight back until July, hopefully.I am desperately concerned for her and find these posts, especially Shaun's, very helpful in keeping me abreast of the situation which is constantly changing - This is a travel forum after all and I am keen to travel as soon as it is safe to do so whether that be in October or next year."
"So, thanks Shaun, for all your posts, keep em comin!and thanks also Hannah for your posts which I have also found to be be very informativeEdited: 10:19 am, June 18, 2020 "
"Chrissie, I was in no way having a dig at you, I understand your situation entirely and even for those folk who do just want to get a summer jolly, I also understand that too. I myself have a holiday booked for October and would love nothing more than to get away but I’m fearful of govt’s & officials particularly The UAE downplaying things as they have a habit of doing so anyhow.It’s a fine balancing act between health & economics and I wouldn’t want to be a politician at the minute but I am concerned when I see numbers increasing in countries that previously had it under control and as soon as air travel resumes to somewhat normal levels I fear the whole scenario is going to play out again!!"
"Apologies Hannah if my response come across a bit strong, that wasn't my intention. Just ignore me, I'm a bit over sensitive at the moment.If my daughter and new grandson were not in Dubai there is no way I would even be thinking about travelling until at least next year but of course realise that others may feel different and that is fine.  I am doing my first supermarket shop this evening, mask and gel at the ready!"
China among the low risk countries :)
"No need to apologise Chrissie, strange times and it’s very stressful. Fingers crossed we get some clarity soon. Maher - I know, the mind boggles!!"
"I’d love to be going back to Dubai this year However , as long as there is any risk of a country having another lockdown , I won’t be travelling anywhere...The thought of being stuck anywhere abroad fills me with terror ... I’m thinking a lot of people will feel the same as i do and will stay home until a vaccine or this virus is under control I’ve worked through out the lockdown so I’ve had some sense of routine , but I understand those who were stuck at home are not going to want to have gone through that for nothing and therefore won’t travel , go to concerts etc for a long time I feel like live as we all know is changed for the foresee future unfortunately"
Stop reading the Daily Mail!I can’t believe all the negativity.
"What negativity are you referring to dartanian?? I’m not aware The Daily Mail invented Covid 19. Whilst I believe there is a fair bit of propaganda and media bias in the way this pandemic has been reported particularly in The UK, however it is a real virus with potential dire consequences so you cannot blame anybody for being cautious or negative as you say.Unless you have a crystal ball I don’t think anybody knows how this is going to play out and whether folk are desperate to get away or want to stay put that’s their choice.If Dubai opens up & everyone gets away ( who wants to) and has a great holiday whilst staying safe and keeping others around them safe then that’s brilliant but if people have genuine concerns then that’s also understandable.There’s no right or wrong approach here"
"Haha, Shaun I knew you were joking... I wasn’t though lol.I love my Mam to bits but 42 years of living a relatively privileged lifestyle in Dubai has somewhat distorted her views on reality. The worst part of Covid 19 for her was being unable to meet up with her fellow like minded Jumeirah Janes for her weekly coffee mornings & Canasta sessions!! The horror of it.As for FB, I can’t stand it as it’s full of useless posts that I’m not interested in ( can’t see why people feel the need to post pictures of their lunch etc) although I do annoy my husband and ask him to look at it from time to time on my behalf!"
"Well my prediction for early July to open up for tourist was correct. Just announced today that tourists can visit again with conditions from July 7. https:/…dubai-to-welcome-tourists-from-july-7Edited: 1:50 pm, June 21, 2020 "
"Only Dubai residents though, for the time being"
