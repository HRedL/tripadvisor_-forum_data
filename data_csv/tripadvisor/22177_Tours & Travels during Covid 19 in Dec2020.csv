"Hello, How is the situation in Frankfurt for international travel ? Is quarantine in effect for international travel tourists ? How long?Based on the situation, I need to cancel my current Lufthansa bookings in dec 2020"
Till now the borders are closed for any tourists from outside Europe. So Americans are not allowed to come in. But nobody knows the situation in December.If I was you I'd try to cancel.
"Way too early to guess what's going to be the rules and travel bans in December. Keep an eye on the website of the US embassy in Berlin https:/… , the FAQ on the website of the German Ministry of the Interior https:/…doc13797140bodyText3 and the German Foreign Office https:/…coronavirus"
Thanks for the info . I plan to cancel Lufthansa ticket
