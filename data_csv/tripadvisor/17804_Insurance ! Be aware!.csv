"We have a 4 week trip planned for May. We read the very, very fine print on our travel insurance and it says we are not covered for a pandemic and so won’t get a refund and lose many $$$ that we have already paid in deposits and flights AND if we decide to go and then catch the virus we are not covered for Any hospitalisation while we are there. We are covered if we should break a leg but not virus related. So check your insurance policy everyone!!!"
... just wanted to add that our trip was 4 weeks from Venice to Sicily. It is a risk that I don’t think we can take..
Pity. But May is at least 8 weeks away. You can't predict situation.
"I would say most policies would be the same, you wont be covered if you decided not to travel yourself. If the airlines cancel or the Government declares not to travel to that area you might have more of a case with your insurance. We are due to travel to Athens in a month and are still planning on going. May is a long way out yet - just wait and monitor until closer to the time and hopefully the situation will improve."
"Although it doesn’t get you the best deals and maybe has limited choice I always buy a package all at once so if one aspect is covered they all are.My trips are June, Sept and October so I feel it will either be controlled or the airlines/holiday companies will be defunct so I hopefully will be covered with insurance/ABTA/credit card."
Good advice. If you are an EU citizen bring your European Health Insurance Card with you too.

"I always buy insurance with ""cancel for any reason"" It costs a bit more, but...."
"I bet that even that has exclusions!,"
"Just a reminder that the European Health Insurance Card is valid also for UK citizens, until the end of the year.If you don't have the EHIC with you, you can apply for a Provisional Replacement Certificate by calling the NHS Overseas Healthcare Services.So in terms of hospital bills we don't have to worry about it. Not until next year at least :(Edited: 10:19 am, February 28, 2020 "
"As an Australian you are covered via Medicare for any hospital treatment etc. as Australia has a reciprocal health coverage arrangement with Italy. Make sure you take your Medicare card with you.I agree re travel insurance..... I read the PDS on 5 travel insurance policies and all of them exclude things like pandemics.Edited: 3:49 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"In Italy you, from anywhere, will be treated without charge in the public health system. But in present circumstances no one is to go to a hospital or family medical practice with symptoms or concerns about COVID-19, you must call a free number, numbers set up by regions, take a wander through https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g18…This discussion thread established in the Venice forum, would be better in the Italy forum, where you will see the myriad local discussions that have been set upAs regards insurance, no, policies are not all the same. But one requirement likely to be in all is for people to go through their bookings and follow all the cancellation procedures. We will suffer some charges in cancelling flights in September-November SYD-Milan, return from Rome, but get most of it back. Airbnb we get it all back, flexible bookings, if cancel, but if it comes to that then we plan to share some of the financial pain of hosts, people with whom we have had happy correspondence. We would lose deposit on Citroen lease booking. All up, cancellation losses under AUD1000 say EUR600 for over two months travel (not including idea of sharing pain with airbnb hosts. We don't know what our own situation may be by September). I'm also conscious that if we do travel, the costs will be way way up! Our insurance kicks in when Smartraveler says don't gohttps:/…italyThe word pandemic does not appear in our detailed policy documents. IF someone has contrary information on Tick insurance please say. Note that we bought cover before all this blew up.Edited: 4:10 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"That’s a shame...but if you still want to cancel, check with airline and hotels. Exceptions and cancellations policies are changing everyday in times like these..."
"Hi Aussie_traveller. My insurance is the same as yours. We have flights book and tours in June. If the tour company cancels you will get your full refund, same as the airline, if they change the flight schedule etc.I have all intentions of going at this time, and will wait and see. My thoughts are this corona virus will hit Australia in clusters very soon. Winter is approaching and weather in Europe will be sunny and warm. You and I have a bit of time on our side to wait and see. Surprisingly it at be a better option to leave the winter..No one knows at this stage. Your tour company may also be able to put you on a other tour in another location..Get a plan B and C That's what I have done"
"Re post #10 - ""As an Australian you are covered via Medicare for any hospital treatment etc. as Australia has a reciprocal health coverage arrangement with Italy. Make sure you take your Medicare card with you.""This statement is incorrect. You MAY be covered for SOME urgent medical care if assessed, by Italian authorities as needing urgent treatment that can not wait until your return home. Not ALL treatment is covered by Australian medicare.Greg"
"The reality now is that the Italian health system is stretched beyond the limit in the north and from the south resources are deployed to the north. Expectations about foreigners' entitlements must be put aside. Recommendations from every reputable authority that travel to Italy be avoided should be heeded. The situation in most of the north is now that casual travel in is prohibited, any exit prohibited. Speculation about what may be the case at some future time is, um, speculation."
"I e just checked our insurance policy and if FCO advises against all but essential travel, we are covered. If something happens whilst there we can claim back additional accommodation expenses.If we just decide not to go, we are not covered if the FCO is not saying that.As EU citizens we do have EHIC cards."
It is quite interesting how insurance vary by country. I paid using my Credit Card and as such such my bank includes basic insurance. This I can then upgrade to a higher level at a smallish cost.Now this insurance is offered by AIG and it covers pandemics in so far as it does not specifically exclude it in the fine print.Do unless Emirates cancels my flight I will land 23 April. If they do...well there must be other routes in.
"#16 you are now covered by UK insurance, as at 18.45 this evening FCO advised against all but essential travel to affected zones."
"Yes, I know, thank you."
My flights sew cancelled but my hotel is non refundable and insurance not paying out so really wonder what is the point of having cover!
"Check insurance again, mine has updated and it appears we are now covered, even though we chose not to go today."
Kim BI would double check your insurance too as ours says they won’t pay out if there is no FCO advice inplace saying they advise against all but essential travel. If you cancelled before the FCO advice they may not pay out.
It is at the hotels discretion to refund bookings.
My insurance company did not cover me for a epidemic or pandemic. I just took out extra medical insurance to cover for the virus. Hopefully never have to use it. But I wont be covered if I travel to a area stated not to travel to.
