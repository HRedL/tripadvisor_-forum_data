"Hi allI am visiting my friend in Paris for holiday and planning to bring some foods to boston. i guess factory-made products (like bon maman jams and nutella) and macarons are okay to bring back, but am i allowed to bring cheese, saucisson and jambon? would it be okay if they are vacuum packed?Also can someone tell me where's a GOOD boucherie for saucisson and jambon cause i only have a marche franprix near my friend's place."
"No, you cannot (legally) bring back cheese or meats.This link might help further:fda.gov/Food/…default.htm"
"Saucisson and ham are not allowed, but I have taken such things dozens of times without incident. When it is intercepted, they just take it away -- they do not fine you or throw you in prison. My biggest tragedy was getting 2 kgs of country bacon confiscated when I was taking it to my parents. On my very next trip at the same airport, no problem at all.Naturally, I do not advocate breaking the law. As far as I am concerned, it is merely a matter of interpreting the law. I feel that the spirit of the law is ""no nasty disgusting things from questionable countries"" and not at all ""no wonderful meaty treats from the completely sanitary first ally of the United States."""
"There will be a section on the customs form you fill out on the plane that asks you if you are carrying food products. ""Yes"" means that you will go through a Department of Agriculture inspection and there are restrictions on what you can bring into the US. This link might get you started on how you might prepare yourself:cbp.gov/xp/…agri_prod_inus.xmlWe've done this, but I would avoid it unless it's something you REALLY want to do and can't get the products stateside. You'll be surprised what you can get through the internet from licensed importers."
"This also might help. It's a copy of the customs form that you will fill out on the plane and ""Agricultural and Wildlife Products"" on the backside has good info.cbp.gov/xp/…sample_declaration_form.xml"
"No beef products at all but other meats in a jar or a can is not a problem in my experience. Put it in your checked bags, not carry on. On many occasions I've brought jarred and canned meats from CDG into Logan. Just about any type of jarred/canned pork or duck product you can think of. As for cheese I'm not really sure what the rules are. Personally I wouldn't want to be eating cheese that's been unrefrigerated for an extended period of time. If you bring it it needs to be in airtight packaging but there may be restrictions on non-pasteurized cheeses and such. Can't help any more than that with the cheese."
"I have always checked ""no"" on the form regarding bringing food into the country. It would be insane to check ""yes."" That is only for people bringing icky things from nasty countries, which I never do. The customs officials and I understand each other. So they wouldn't think of opening my baggage."
Bonne Maman products are readily available in supermarkets all over the US as are many other imported jams --There is a reason that sausage is not allowed -- the last outbreak of hoof and mouth disease in the Northern Hemisphere was caused by discarded scraps of sausage brought back from Europe that were fed to pigs -- it has been awhile since this occurred but just as home grown fruit is considered a danger to agriculture so is farm made sausage or other farm cured meats.
"I have often brought back ""declared"" cheese from France and The Netherlands. At Customs they have asked or confirmed it was hard cheese and never any inspections or confiscations. I am guessing the soft ripe cheese might not have the proper processing."
"Pork products are prohibited, unless processed into a terrine or pate, and hermetically sealed into a can or jar with an expiration date at least three years from the date of purchase stamped onto the packaging (not handwritten).Raw-milk cheeses less than 60 days old are also prohibited, although stories abound of customs officials looking the other way on small amounts (obviously for personal consumption and not for resale).as always, please use the Customs and Border Protection and the FDA websites as the final authority, not the opinions of non-government posters on a public forum.Edited: 8 years ago "
"Ah, so nice to have upright citizens to make your decisions for you. Common sense is so overrated! No law is ever obsolete or discriminatory, so all must be followed without question. Your own brain in superfluous.Otherwise, prepare to rot in prison.Edited: 8 years ago "
"K2, have a bad morning or something?The rules are generally there for the protection of the agriculture of the country into which you are bringing the food, not for an arbitrary reason.Diseases such as BSE were in the UK (nice clean friendly country) and have to be kept out of other countries unless you want Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Even so, there were still some confirmed cases in the USA.In Australia you will have luggage xrayed and searched if necessary, in front of you, and you will be fined. If you declare stuff they will inspect it and make a decision based on the safety of the food. For example, no honey, as we don't have brood disease here.Yet time and again on a show called Border Security we see people bringing in raw sausages, plants in soil, cheeses, fruits etc, all ticking the ""nothing to declare"" box and all having the stuff confiscated and being fined.tv.com/shows/…The restrictions for America are actually pretty mild and shouldn't cause problems, though check the meat section carefully.http://tinyurl.com/6hvlb5bEdited: 8 years ago "
"k2, I couldn't possibly care less what you or anyone else carries onto an airplane, or what happens to you if you get caught with something you shouldn't be taking across borders.I quoted the regulations, and added a disclaimer lest some nitwit use ""but Sunshine said it was okay"" as a half-baked excuse.Just remember this conversation when some invasive species is introduced with disastrous results into France, mmkay?The laws apply to everyone traveling from every country, no matter how high and mighty you might think your developed-nation status might make you."
"Meats are not allowed. I asked at customs a few months ago about cheese. I was told by an inspector that up to 4 lbs is allow of any kind of cheese (any kind includes those not otherwise available in the USA).From Lynn B's US Customs link above:Cheese- Solid cheese (hard or semi-soft, that does not contain meat), butter, butter oil, and cultured milk products such as yogurt and sour cream are not restricted. Feta cheese, Brie, Camembert, cheese in brine, Mozzarella and Buffalo Mozzarella are permissible"
"Tinned meats as in pates ARE allowed, I have brought them back openly. Sausages , salamis,,etc, are however a no no,, although it is hard for me to understand the words ""left overs"" and ""discarded"" being used in same sentence with my lovely sauissons.."
There is a cheese shop located at the Metro Maubert Mutualite that will vacuum pack your cheese to take home. I've done this several times and declared it at customs in the US with no problems.
"I don't have time to read current regulations but here's my experience at Logan about 4 years ago. I had a whole suitcase full of canned and jarred pork and duck products. The customs lady asked if I had any food. Confidently I replied ""No"". But since she was training a new employee she used my suitcase as an example of how to search a suitcase. When she opened my suitcase I said ""Oh, you mean THAT food"". She told us that everything we had was perfectly fine, to which I replied ""Of course, that's why I said no"". She said as long as everything was packed in a jar or can and didn't have any of what she referred to as boof (boeuf) we were OK. This whole incident did lead to some marital problems, however, since my wife said I was so convincing when I replied ""No"" to the customs lady she wondered how many I've lied to her. She'll never know. ;)"
"My experience agrees with most here. Meats a no no, solid cheeses ok. Most of time the canned stuff is ok too but once we had some dear canned pates confiscated from us. It was near time of avian flu scare and one woman heard the word ""goose"" and cried foul fowl. So there are at least two people interpreting the law here, you and the inspector."
...and YOUR interpretation bears no importance whatsoever -- only the interpretation (and the mood) of the inspector.
"Sunshine817 is right...anytime you go through customs, you have to hope that you don't get the agent who is having a bad day. Regulations are open to interpretation and the agent makes the call...just be ready with your pleas and receipts. I was armed with a whole envelope full of back up when we traveled to Mexico for my daughter's wedding. Items made in China in quantities that could be considered for ""resale"" are contraband there, and with the load we were hauling in the hands of the wrong agent, we had numbers that could have been interpreted this way. Try to plan a wedding without favors, bags, gifts etc. that aren't made in China! After reading about one bride who had everything taken by an agent, I frantically cut out and covered labels and gathered receipts. This wasn't food, but these items were subject to confiscation as we're discussing here. In the end, it was all for naught, and I was even able to get her bouquet through US customs on our way back home (live flowers, but no dirt!). Go figure... It's always a good idea to know the regulations, decide how important bringing the items back really is to you, and have things packaged, labeled and documented in a manner that you can present your case if challenged."
"Just as we know that enforcement is selective, the other side knows that observation of the rules is also selective.It usually works out in the end."
"Haven't read all this thread (but I think I get the gist of it. :-) ). This is a frequently discussed topic in travel forums. In my opinion, the US import laws are completely ridiculous. I read somewhere online (you can probably find it with google) that Prosciutto producers in Parma really expected that with the election of Obama that restrictions on the importation of Culatello (mankind's finest ham) would be removed (I thought this was a pretty funny expectation, like people in America even know what Culatello is), but I digress...Jullian, the problem with bringing food into Logan is that the Beagle, who I have seen sniff out a single green apple, will undoubtedly find your sausage. So beware! You will not be arrested because you forgot to declare it, but you will not get to keep it."
"With all due respect, nobody cares what anyone's opinion is of the regulations for the US (or the UK, or France, or Uzbekistan or anywhere else on the planet).The regulations are there for some reason (obscure as it might be) and it is not up to the traveling public to decide what is and is not applicable to them...Carry whatever you like -- but be prepared to lose it...be prepared to face the consequences if whatever the gremlin-of-the-day is should be tracked back to whatever YOU carried illegally across the border...and be prepared to have it taken even if it meets every letter of the law.Please ask the hundreds of Florida and Brazil citrus producers who, a few years ago, saw their groves being bulldozed and torched when citrus canker was introduced to the state by illegal imports feel about border controls. Many of these families have lost their groves and their livelihood -- all because somebody thought that it was no big deal to bring in a bag of fruit from a quarantined nation."
"Feel free to provide us with horror stories of epidemics or parasites spread by foie gras, sausage or cheese while you're at it.You seem to have missed the point, Sunshine. (But I really like you anyway -- don't forget that!)"
"Foie gras (prepared) and cheese (as above) are legal -- moot point.Unprepared foie gras (or even mi-cuit) won't survive without refrigeration that long -- so it's not a good gamble anyway.and here's the link on pork products: http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D9117.PDFScroll down for the French version -- boring, technical, and lists all the reasons why you shouldn't carry it across borders.Google ""pork products import risks"" for enough to put you to sleep within minutes."
"Just adding a quick story since I was always asked at customs if I brought in canned Sausage (Leberwurst, Schwartenmagen) as these will get confiscated. I never dared, but they always asked while I had a German Passport (when I was a resident).... now that I am an American they don't ask anymore LOL. But I don't try - I would be too upset if they'd take it away from me."
"sunshine, by your logic, nobody would smoke marijuana because it's illegal!"
Marijuana doesn't typically carry the potential to introduce harmful invasive species with the ability to destroy the local agriculture. It must have been a pretty fat one to be able to draw some line of logic between sausage and pot.
"Thomas. No A lot of people do not smoke pot just because it is illegal. People do not do a lot of things because they are illegal. Laws are there to be obeyed and fortunately if you don't agree with them, we, you, and the French have a democratic process to change them. Laws keep society together and give some semblance of order. Otherwise somebody could just come and rob or murder you because the didn't agree with the lawEdited: 8 years ago "
"I don't know how this suddenly became the drug thread, but French teenagers are the biggest cannabis consumers in Europe, according to EU statistics. This is attributed to the repressive policy and the subsequent ""forbidden fruit"" attraction.Nevertheless, casual users still get off with just a warning in at least 90% of the cases."
I was of course joking. Everybody knows that smoking plants should be illegal!
