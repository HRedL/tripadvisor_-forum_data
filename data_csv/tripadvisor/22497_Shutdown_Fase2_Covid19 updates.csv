"I am putting this up so that we can keep information in one place. As of April 7th, Acapulco (and the rest of Mexico) is in Phase 2 of quarantine. People are allowed out, but not to congregate in groups. All non-essential businesses have closed, including bars and clubs.Most hotels are closed, and have furloughed workers.Occupancy rates have fallen below 5%All public events are cancelled. The beaches have been closed. Alcohol sales are permitted in Guerrero.The local government has begun limited disbursement of essentials. Some of the government employees have been robbed of these essentials and their trucks burned. Security has been deployed to prevent looting. There have been at least 4 attempts of organized looting, and rumors persist online. The government is threatening 16 year prison sentences for those who participate. There have been demonstrations by numerous groups, street blockages and disruptions as these groups seek government assistance. The politicians have committed to a 50% pay cut (not including bribes, I am sure)They have started tuition assistance and disability assistance. They have set up a mental health line. They have sent up a bank account at Bancomer for donations.There have been 32 ""confirmed"" cases, and 1 death. Testing is still practically non-occuring."
"""There have been 32 ""confirmed"" cases, and 1 death. Testing is still practically non-occuring""Then how did they found those 33 people, volunteers?"
"Exactly. Volunteers. Not like the Mexican government is being proactive like South Korea or some other nations.People have been asking for testing. But there are only 2 sites in Acapulco that require testing, and they are rejecting most. Only those showing the full range of symptoms have been administered tests. With about 20k tests performed in the entire country with a population of 90 million as of yesterday, I think ""practically non-occuring"" is an accurate assessment."

You took time and effort to post this information and many of us don't know the depth of it. I just take issue in what we don't know. I haven't read much about our ""delay"" except from foreign sources and this mostly from opinion pieces. I haven't heard of a single Mexican Citizen turned away to be found infected after.

"@flygt ""a symptom of a larger problem""Please tell me how this gives you the right to ridicule it with your attempt at sarcasm. While you're at it, tell me of the many noble things you're doing to correct the problem at a global level instead of using it as an excuse to condemn Mexico on a travel forum.I'll wait."
"Miguel A, I was not trying to insinuate a Mexican/US comparison. The US response has been poor in comparison to South Korea, as well. Believe me, I am not holding the US in any high regard in this situation, with the exception of a few governors who are desperately trying to catch up to and control the epidemic in their states. The testing requirements vary by location. In my state, the drive up requirements do not require headache/pain behind the eyes, but are very strict in using fever as an indicator along with cough. Some days testing is limited to only Medical/First responders. Other states have started to try random testing as well as testing those showing symptoms. The random testing is still very limited. I am far from an expert on this topic, just sharing what I do know, along with my opinions to a travel board."
"Yeah, that sounds about right. I realize Mexico is far from where we should be in terms of responding to a world pandemic. I know the US is behind as well. I just think that if I went let's say to the California TA forum and start disparaging elected officials on the matter, my guess is I'm gonna have a hard time validating my points to Americans even if they agree with me, being a Mexican, wouldn't you say?First thing I would be demanded is to maybe launch a FundMe campaign and open my own testing site.Next thing I would be demanded is that I ""go back"" to wherever I come from, even if I'm a resident.Please tell me I'm wrong"

Sorry @flygt I fail to see the humor.
Fiesta Americana closed yesterday.
"Miguel, I wish I could say you are wrong, but I'd be lying. You'd absolutely get it worse than most. But then again, if you want to the Cali board and made sure your criticisms were directed at the Federal level and not the state level? They would be happy to let you join in. If you read through my posts, I am not a MAGA hat wearer. I am not, will not defend the US on their handling of this, especially on a Federal level. But saying ""the US is behind as well"" is a dangerous game - you set the bar very low. Almost every country could have done better, from China to Iran to Italy to the US to Mexico. The only one who set a ""good"" example - one of being proactive, responsive, and aggressive in its testing and tracking was South Korea, and a few other Asian countries - mainly because of previous experience. But if you want us to compare bad situations, take NYC and Mexico. Both had their first Covid case around the same time - February 28/29th. Since then, NYC has done 283,612 tests, with about 72,324k being positive, 3,485 deaths, and 4,604 in intensive care. As of Monday night Mexico has run a total of 20,475 tests, with 6,295 :suspicious cases.So NYC is running about 25% positive with rigorous testing, and Mexico about 30%. We are running about 1.4% ""grave condition"" and Mexico 1.6%. SourcesMexico https://www.unionguanajuato.mx/articulo/2020…New York https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/new-…So we are seeing a similar correlation among testing rates and positive cases. You say you haven't heard of anyone being turned away who later turned positive. Now here's the problem to me, which as you know, has been hotly debated. The spike in ""atypical pneumonia"" deaths in Mexico. Now I don't have statistics on this. An article here, an article there. But they are happening, and it seems like unlikely coincidence that Mexico is facing two potential epidemics. So wouldn't this lead you to believe that maybe these cases be undiagnosed Covid 19? Maybe this is a bad example. I know that the Federal government calls this ""fake news"". But I don't have any more faith in your Federal government than I do in mine. https:/…So even comparing bad apples, Mexico is coming up short where it counts, on testing. You're not alone. Our president is more focused on his re-election campaign and the economy than anything. What has been accomplished is more or less in spite of our administration. If you took out NY and NJ from our stats (who's recent improvement in combating this is the result of the Governors), the rest of the country would look a lot similar to what you are facing now. We were worse than you - as a country we had our first case in January, weeks before it was in Mexico, and did nothing.  And we both look a hell of a lot better than Brazil, where Bolsonaro still doesn't think this is.a big deal. So if I am critical of Mexico, its because people I love live there, and I want them safe. If I seem a bit strident about it, I apologize, I have been cooped up in my house for 3 weeks. I am not doing any of this because I want to pick on Mexico, or I am trying to say America is better. I wanted (and still want) Mexico to have learned from our mistakes and our ignorance, if there is still time."
"Fair enough. You raise some good points. No one's gonna read our posts, a bit long lol. I would say first that you have much better insight than good sources. Especially that Coahuila journalist. Is not a matter of language, the guy can't even quote, let alone provide hard facts.""saying ""the US is behind as well"" is a dangerous game - you set the bar very low"" No I do not. I just wrote it as an example, I have no business standing behind that statement because I don't even have the data to support it.You said on a previous post that you're not drawing comparisons between US and Mexico, but you do lol!Not only do you compare but you continue your fervor with SK handling of the problem and that's cool, no one is arguing that but I think it's premature to throw flowers at the contenders.You started a good thread, but like many posters, in this forum people won't be happy without throwing a jab at Mexico somewhere in the text and the funny thing is that it's such an ingrained stance it's hardly even noticed.I never thought you're a Trump supporter and frankly, I couldn't care less if you're an R or a D. I can assure you there's a wide swath of conservatives in Mexico and in this forum and that doesn't bother me one bit because many of them love Mexico maybe even more than I do and also they have the sense to refrain from making indelicate remarks and they're old enough to pick their battles.Keep posting, I'm comfortable debating with you.Edited: 9:06 pm, April 07, 2020 "
"Miguel, to be clear, I did not bring the US into the conversation as a comparison until you brought it up in regards to testing. ""Did you know that in the US you can only get tested if you're ""showing the full range of symptoms""? I'm willing stand corrected, since I'm not an ""expert""."" It was only then that I used it as a point of reference, specifically in response to you. "" I know the US is behind as well."" I took you at your word on that. Now you are saying you don't know, you just wrote it as an example? You are the one who brought the US into the mix here. Regardless of why you went that route - trying to deflect culpability by pointing out potentially worse examples. We call it ""what-about-ism"" here - its a BS political game that is all the rage here. It's a copout. A failing. When someone wants to improve, you look to the good example. When someone wants to skate bye, they point to the bad example to deflect blame. Both our countries can be better. Let's compare ourselves the country the rest of the world seems to agree on as having done a good job. You are more than welcome to withhold your praise of South Korea. The rest of the world is holding them up as the good example, as they kept their infection rate to a minimum. They had their first case in the middle of February. They had a plan in place ready for an event like this. Their diligent efforts - over 350,000 tests, and tracing contact allowed them to contain the virus, and their continued efforts have resulted in a situation where they did not need a general lockdown to do it. They did close down schools, which are set to open this week. No other country can say that, except China, who many believe are hiding both the size and the severity of the original outbreak. https://www.barrons.com/articles/south-korea…https:/…My sources on NY and Mexico are rock solid. You don't like the reporter from Coahuila, that's fine. Here are more publications, Cancunhttps:/… Zacatecashttps:/…139108Puebla Statehttps://www.elsoldepuebla.com.mx/local/estad…I understand that the atypical pneumonia is a debated topic - the secretary for health for Chihuahua is saying they had less cases not more. But once again, we are back to my original point. Testing. Mexico is not doing enough of it, despite seeing how effective it is (South Korea) and how not doing it until its too late (Italy, US) is a bad idea. ""I just take issue in what we don't know. I haven't read much about our ""delay"" except from foreign sources and this mostly from opinion pieces. We know. All easily found on Google. Search ""First Covid date"" or ""Covid Testing Timeline"" and the country. South Korea first case Jan 20. 7 Weeks later over 200k people had been tested. First US case was Jan 20th, 7 Weeks later, less than 6000 people had been tested. First Mexican case confirmed Feb 28th, you are just shy of 6 weeks, and 20k tests. I do see and agree with your point, about the jabs. Not helpful. I do appreciate you sticking with the thread though. OK, this thread has gone way off topic - which was to have a central ""Acapulco Covid info"" point of access about what's open and not, the general state of affairs, as AcaResident had suggested. I will start a new one in the morning."
"Jesuschrist you're longwinded.First things first: I mentioned the testing thinking you're an American bemoaning our testing parameters and pointing out the similarities. I'm not here to ruminate on US health policies, there's literally millions of webpages on the subject and moreover, we both agree it leaves more questions than answers. ""My sources on NY and Mexico are rock solid"". See, when you type this you loose half your audience. I bet you could write a much better article than the sources you share and that's not even a compliment.You may be right, but Atypical Pneumonia is not something I'm willing to discuss because I know nothing about it. I will let you in on a well known fact and a less known fact. US and Mexico follow similar protocols when listing a deceased person's 'cause of death'. Many people dying in North America today may have died of a Covid-19 related complications yet their 'cause of death' may remain 'respiratory failure', 'atypical pneumonia' and what have you. Italy may be the first country (don't quote me) that has began to list their deceased patients with Covid-19 as the 'cause of death' in their certificates. This is part of the reason why their pandemia death rates are so high.Years from now, we may learn that many more died in Mexico as a result of the pandemia or misdiagnosis, today comfortably listed as a myriad of other causes. I will just leave you with the question of what's being done about this in the United States since we follow similar 'cause of death' listing protocols as opposed to say, Italy. Enjoy your evening.Edited: 10:31 am, April 09, 2020 "
"So, in brief - The US entered the conversation at your prompting, not mine. You are not here to ruminate on US health policies. It seems that there are no sources you trust, will make an argument on, or will cite. Atypical pneumonia is not something you are willing to discuss.To answer your final question - what's being done in the US? (aforementioned declaration aside) The answer is simple - more testing. The 6000 number of tests at the beginning of March has grown to over 2 million. Some states have started random testing in limited trials to identify asymptomatic carriers. Deceased suspected to have died from Corona in some states are being tested for Corona post mortem. This has been part of the spike seen in places like New York, where backdated deaths are added to the daily tallies."
"Um ok yeah, basically. Can you please source your last paragraph?"
"https:/…https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/04/ohio-…As for backdated postmortem data, you can check the guidelines on the CDC website regarding provisional estimates. ""The numbers differ in part because of a lag in reporting, and because the code for recording covid-19 as a cause of death was not announced until March 24, weeks after the first known case of an American dying of the disease caused by the coronavirus. Death certificate data will be part of the CDC's new effort to estimate total covid-19 fatalities.""https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/…"
Enough already. There are plenty of websites where you can get all the information you need. There are also the off topic forums either here or on Facebook that you can continue your discussion. This is the Acapulco forum and you have totally left the building on this one.
"Hahaha somebody needs a snickers bar. Look I would normally agree with you jane, but there's only so many things you can say about a closed beach. Thanks for the links RFNJ, they're recent and sourced. Something good about this thread is two adults have a civil conversation in a forum where normally people are daily at each other throats and I can see why. Now back to our regular programming.Edited: 10:33 am, April 09, 2020 "
I can't say I learned anything but enjoyed it. :)
Alrighty then. Sanity to the rescue.New update today.https:/…
https:/…60 HOTELS now closed in Acapulco (or more)
"As there were people ""keeping the party going"" at La Quebrada and La Sinfonia - two popular hangout spots - people park and basically tailgate on weekends, these areas have now been closed to traffic to prevent people congregating. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNHd6TD0Zm8"
The cathedral in the zocalo has also closed until further notice. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxiCnLGMh1Q
"RFNJ - the news a couple of days ago showed how beautiful the Sinfonia is.....clean sidewalks, no litter. That's probably a first in a long time. As to the cathedral, were those two gringos walking by????"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEnK9crpkc8
"It looked like two gringos to me. At least they are better behaved then the gringos in PV at the moment. I am hearing reports (unconfirmed) that there are still tourists arriving to Acapulco, in spite of everything. The police, in addition to the blocking of Lopes Mateo, have been doing sweeps along the main streets shutting down the bars and spots that should have closed days ago. As of the governor's briefing today, 171 hotels have closed their doors."
"Its a ghost town in Costa Azul, and although I haven't strayed far from my place other than the market i do have a view high up in all directions. Have never seen this place this dead. Some of my younger local friends were not taking it as serious 2 weekends ago and were out at bars/clubs, last weekend and this week have been responsible..... My building has hand sanitizer and tissues in the elevators and every entrance/exit, thankfully..... Some of the older folks here are not leaving their condos at all, food being taken up to right outside their front door. As far as beachside, I have a view from the naval base to santa lucia (mostly unobstructed) and i see 2 people on the entire beach. As far as the other side, I still see some people playing golf, but not many. A friend from Acapulco but who lives in Mexico City arrived here yesterday around 6pm via Bus to be with her family after she lost her job and said it was 30% full. I would say from what I can see, overall, people are taking it more seriously than I thought they would. - Could care less about debating on this topic - just some notes from on the ground. Thanks for posting the updates, RF"
"I’ve tried to figure out if a gringo refers to all foreigners or just Americans. If it’s the latter, those gentlemen in PV were identified as Canadians from BC."
"Sorry I missed my edit. They were not ""gentlemen."" Wrong word choice.Edited: 3:31 pm, April 10, 2020 "
Nick thank you for real information from the ground here! It is much appreciated rather than third and fourth party reports! Stay safe my friend!
"I am glad that your friends are starting to take things more seriously. And I am glad your building has the essentials - the administrator of my condo said they ran out of gel, and they were having trouble getting more. Amazon to the rescue on that one. Some of my friends still don't get it. Hopefully they will realize that quarantine means all the time, not just when you have nothing to do."
RFNJ...I know someone here that thinks it is spread through the soil. He's telling people to put Mentholatum on their feet and they will not catch it.....now that is scary.
"Ok, that wins. Just one question. Why not just wear shoes??????"
Yeah shoes work lol. Can't say i heard that one Dray too funny.
