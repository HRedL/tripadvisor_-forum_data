"I heard that there’s a quarantine period for Australia. If it’s for travelers to Australia, how much extra will it be usd? How likely is it that the quarantine period and fee will still be in effect throughout next year at minimum? Even if there is a vaccine I still think there will be questions about how much they’ll be able to make and how long it will take to make them."
If there is a vaccine next year... i suspect the only requirement for entry will be proof of vaccination - similar to how schools / child care in my state require me to send a vaccination certificate for my daughter before she can attend their site...If no vaccine - i doubt very much that international leisure travel will be a thing for some time... the USA is still experiencing 60-70 000 new cases daily - and only 4 million infected from a population of 330 million means this could be going for a loooooong time..
Australia is not accepting any travellers apart from Australians returning from other countries. Tourists from other countries will not be admitted in the foreseeable future. The CEO of Qantas thinks that international travel will not return to normal until July 2021 at the earliest.
"Australians returning from overseas currently have to quarantine for two weeks. They have to pay for this themselves - it varies from state to state, but from about $2500 (that's Australian dollars) including food. Locations also vary from basic airport hotels to inner city hotels, or, in the Northern Territory, to a resurrected mining camp behind a barbed wire security fence. This is not a 2 week vacation. In the hotels, you are mostly confined to your room, with food placed outside the door - not room service food of your choice, either.This quarantine is for returned Australian citizens, plus a very small number of compassionate cases. A significant number of them do test positive for Covid 19 during their quarantine. I can't see the Australian government allowing anyone else from overseas in to the country for some time, quarantine or not.This is the government advice on quarantine: health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coron…Edited: 11:41 pm, July 27, 2020 "
Also for the record I plan to visit Queensland.
"Traveler, you are not getting the message. The border is closed. Unless you are Australian, or married to one here, you cant get in, and there is no news on when the restrictions will be lifted."
I understand. I’m just wanting to add specifics.
"Australia currently has a limit on arrivals in Australia, and this focuses on citizens and permanent resident holders, though there are exceptions in a small number of circumstances, such as specialised workers or for very specific personal reasons. The quarantine period is 2 weeks, and in Queensland the price is around $3000, which includes stay in a hotel and meals, but the cost of security is met by the Australian government. I believe they are still providing free COVID-19 healthcare to non-Australians, but best to make sure you have travel insurance to cover this."
"Pretty well summed up in the posts.Very hard to really say what might happen next week in Australia .We just wait and see what the Government announces ,then something happens and it gets changed.However , when it comes to a Vaccine , it will take a long time once ,or if it happens.If it does happen , people travelling will probably need to prove to they have been Vaccinated.I doubt that looking forward that the ""Tourist "" will go into Quarantine , it is just costing too much. We do not know how much the full cost is. That said it would be around 10,000 AUD to do a cost recover.Good Luck"
Re #4: Currently lots of Australians who are not allowed to visit Queensland.
Visit Queensland?We're not even allowed to visit neighbouring suburbs in Melbourne
"Queensland is closing its border to people from Greater Sydney from this Saturday. It is already closed to people from Victoria.I would not anticipate that overseas leisure travel will be allowed in the near future. Even if you are prepared to pay to spend 14 days in policed hotel isolation, it is highly unlikely that there woul dbe the capcity to do this for tourists. There are already limits on numbers for returning citizens and residents, who also need to pay approx $3,000 (AUD, you do the math)"
