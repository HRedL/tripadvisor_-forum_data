"Is anyone worried about the corona virus in Myanmar or is it just me. We go in a couple of day. Going to Yangon,Mandalay,Bagan and the beach at Ngapali."
No one is worrying. It's just you !
"Then it is safe to go,the time to think about cancelling is when the UK gives out an advisory to only travel to Myanmar on essential business-then your Travel Insurance would be invalid.SSThere are two confirmed cases now in Newcastle Hospital but no warnings about travelling there..."
Definitely wont be cancelling. Was just a bit worried thats all! Thanku for your reply.
"I have a trip this week. I have read foreign commonwealth advice as I'm from uk but I wanted insider's feedback please.I wanted to know what the situation is there locally please because I read about there being inadequate healthcare there, tests for coronavirus needing to be sent to Bangkok and taking 7 days, face masks being sold out and concerns about coronavirus emerging through Chinese land border.I wanted to know:1. Are people wearing face masks daily?2. Are masks sold in shops?3. What's the situation like for people over there?Thanks"

"I can tell you direct informations from my friend in Mandalay: A lot of Chinese came in through landways to escape Corona in their country. The health care system is absolutely unsufficient. To be honest, it even frightenes me to think of those hospital facilities I visited. Third world standards, without money no treatment, dirt, infections. Masks are sold on black market with sky high prices. People are not worried because there is nothing to worry about (official version). In my view, stay at home, be happy to know that you get a competent treatment if you would need it nearby and postpone your trip."
I totally agree with your viewpoint. No point taking unnecessary risk sometimes especially with Myanmar or other Asia countries. I cancelled my trip and switched continents.
I cancelled my trip.Someone posted today.Take masks from U.K. if you're still going and lots of UK medication.Be mindful that travel insurance won't cover you!
"Yet cases in the UK are higher than Thailand and Myanmar put together? Where did you switch to?Many countries are issuing restrictions, even China has. You even find the UK is on the list soon."
"KatrupaHow can you possibly give advice about a country you have never even visited before?I'm currently 2 weeks into a 3 week visit, and the country is still virus free, unlike my home county in the UK which now had 4 confirmed cases. I'm so glad I'm in Myanmar, where no one is remotely interested in the paranoia, rather than being at home in the UK where people are planning for Armageddon !"
"Yes you are right about the paranoia in the UK over it, I wish I had stayed in SE Asia longer. I think this maybe affecting the OP's judgement.So you cancelled and lost your money?Edited: 12:20 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"Understand your concern I felt the same before travelling. Been here 2 weeks no sign of anyone sick, coughing or sneezing . Noone wearing masks except in airports. We have been in Mandalay, Bagan, pindalaya, inle lake and now at Ngapoli. Amazing country . Dont be scared or worried. All seems ok. Safer than UK and countries in Europe. The Burmese people dont seem to travel far and are really pleased to see you."
"Ha so true! We are in MM at the minute. Towns are ghost towns. On the upside, nice to have the temples pretty much to yourself with only a few locals."
Some people wearing masks but latest (scientific) reports are that masks do almost nothing to prevent infection and that they can actually increase the risk (as more likely to touch face with mask on)... Advice is to wash hands well and avoid touching your face.
Myanmar Government say there is no coronavirus case on his territory https://www.mmtimes.com/news/three-deaths-no…
