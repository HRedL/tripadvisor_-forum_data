"All news to me..I was there in August and still alive to tell the story.That said they spray when I was there ,but they do every August.Chok Dee"

"Ok, lets forget the numbers, percents and so on :-) anyone knows what is the status in Chiang Mai, now as the rainy season is over, is there still an outbreak or has it taken off?"
Thanks MrCycling.Anyone else who has been recently or is in the Chiang Mai area now?
More dusibfirmation from Mr Cycling An outbreak is an occurrence of disease greater than expected at a particular time and place.
"More dis-information from Mr Cycling An outbreak is a clearly defined term; an occurrence of disease greater than expected at a particular time and place.An epidemic is a large outbreak affecting a larger region or country.The thresholds for these definitions are not a fixed number that applies equally to every disease, they are set relative to the numbers of incidents expected. This year the numbers are a lot higher than expected …So a relatively small increase can be classified as an outbreakThe risk to a visitor to Thailand or any region is relatively small. But as a foreigner, you may be more susceptible to catching the disease as you are unlikely to have all the antibodies. Tourists are also less likely to take appropriate steps to avoid the disease.The main factor is how much care you take to protect yourself against the disease.If you are not aware of how the disease is transmitted and the natural history of the particular aedes mosquito in Thailand, you are at a disadvantage and more likely to succumb.Actual dengue lasts for about 5 days but the dibilitating after-effects can last for days or weeks, so easily destroying your holiday.I would be very unlikely to cancel a holiday anywhere just because of dengue but regardless of the mathematical risks, i would take thorough precautions…. Lets face it ….. .it isn't so much the risk, it's what's at steak the counts.Edited: 10:08 am, October 21, 2019 "
"One needs to bear in mind that Mr Cycling has a vested interest in the local tourist industry and does not like anything that may criticise his business interests such as questions about dengue, animal welfare, or anything that upsets his apple cart"
"To cut through everything, you are fine to come to CM. Just take the ususal precautions for protection."
"Agree with #12.Usual precautions esp around sunset and sunrise, should see you in good stead."
"Surely the numbers are the most important thing, so why aren't you interested in them. If the risk is 0.06% as quoted then to me that would not be a risk worth considering. You would have to move the decimal point 2 places before I would be more careful with applying repellent etc."
"Would that be 6 cases per 10,000 people?600 cases per million people. I have no idea if that is good or bad.That seems"
"Bad if you get it, good if you don't"
"""Surely the numbers are the most important thing, so why aren't you interested in them. If the risk is 0.06%'m""Its not the risk so much as the stake.Unlike many activities, you have got limited control over whether or not you get the disease or not .If you do get the disease then it can be anything from mild to FATAL.It can take a chunk out of your holiday or even a chunk out if your life and can result in added expenses. Thailand loses millions of working hours to dengue every year.Dengue can occur in hotspots and clusters so the riks are not evenly distributed around the country and many are unaware that it occurs more in densely populated areas....e.g cities and holiday resorts.Thailand is very bad at compiling or releasing reliable and detailed statistics.... for instance how many foreigners catch or return home to get dengue. so gauging the risk numerically is not really possible.I wouldnt recommend cancelling but to poo-poo precautions is foolhardyEdited: 8:27 pm, October 28, 2019 "
"Just got back....sure hope i don't get it, but i spray"
