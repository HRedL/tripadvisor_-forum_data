"Just wondering if Australians are still flying normally for domestic travel? In US, nonessential travel for business is way way down. DC looks empty compared to other years this time. Cherry blossoms at end of month...hmmm."
We all got ours last week. Same as if snow or hurricane predicted.
"Shopping for TP is the new sport - carefully plan and time your visit, bring a friend to get more rolls, be prepared for disappointment on arrival as empty shelves for first half of the game, at half time do the other shopping (rice, pasta, UHT milk, candles, batteries, soap) and then a come back in the second half when a new pallet comes out with TP and you grab 76 rolls - victory for the home side."
"My SiL works for a large global firm with its HQ in London. He travels interstate regularly for work and had an Asia/Pacific regional conference scheduled for Bkk later this month. The company has made a worldwide call - no travel so it's all off, they're using video conferencing for the domestic meetings and he is still waiting TBA for what will happen with the Bkk conference.dy - missed out on the tp during last nights weekly grocery shop - 76 rolls to the home team was nothing compared with what happened in front of us. Can you carry 6 jumbo packs and still see where you are going?Edited: 3:35 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"I haven't read anything in the media that domestic travel is down ... I assume most holiday type flights are booked way in advance and from what I can tell no one is cancelling. It's possible business travel is curtailed.My partners business partner heads to Seattle for a conference next week ... that is still going ahead.If I could I'd head to Venice right now ... webcams show St Marks Square almost deserted, looks like a dream time to visit.Edited: 4:26 pm, March 05, 2020 "

I'm with Able - I'd really love to be in Venice right now. I've never seen it so empty.I had shoulder surgery in December and am facing 6-12 months recovery. The one thing that has turned out well is that I had to put planned European travel on hold.

"Flew domestically Jetstar for pleasure last Sunday Plane was full. Airport was busy - no obvious sign of anything not normal.All my business travel is cancelled for the next month at least.

"On the other side of the fence, there hasn’t been any noticeable drop off in domestic inbound, and if anything there has been a slight uptick in volume, which is due to significant rate cuts across the CBD.It’s a good time for local weekenders, with some five star hotels advertising under $200 per night on Friday and Saturday nights In regards to toilet paper, we’ve spoken to industry suppliers and they are having a hoot. They said that this current level of panic buying can continue for 12mths and their stock levels wouldn’t deplete - and that’s just their stock level, not taking into account what they can produce over that time period"

@14 The Australian Pix ah I was too young to be allowed to read it during the '60s but my uncle always had copies of in the little room to assist in mediation etc. A more higher class version than the Melbourne Truth which itself was far better than those TV wedding reality shows which are on now.
We have a stupid amount of toilet paper in our house all the time even without the Great Toilet Paper Panic of 2020. This is because we have more toilets than people - as is our right in modern Australia (eye roll emoji) No toilet paper at all in Coles East Bendigo this afternoon. Just some staff talking about how often they get asked about it when working in that aisle.
"I bet that Toowoomba family is re-messaging that purchase. Who’s got foresight, eh, eh."
I wonder how long this is going to go on for. And when it starts to go to deodorants and things. Is anyone taking odds on the next rush?
"my sister gave my elderly parents a box of TP from ""Who gives a Crap' at xmas https://au.whogivesacrap.org/ ... much to the mirth of the 3 late teen grandsons.Wonder who is laughing now?"
"Im still flying domestic for work twice a week and also came back on weekend from Brisbane for a party. Planes into Darwin were a little emptier, but its wet season so thats usual. Planes out of Darwin were full to busting. We are a small place and sparser population anyway, so we all dont live on top of each other like the bigger cities which may be an advantage in times like this. But please dont hog all the deoderant down south. We need it, you guys dont lol."
"If the situation continues to escalate, and I had to take a punt on the next rush, it’ll be frozen items."
I'd bet on Panadol
Panadol is important because its not able to be completely manufactured here BUT we have a huge TP manufacturing plant right here in SA currently working 24/7. We will NOT run out!
You don't need kitty litter except to put under the BBQhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvyjZIDuzEM
Businesses are taking precautions and banning non urgent travel especially when they can use alternatives such as Skype. Also people will drive instead of driving I expect.
"Hate to confess it but we're already panadol and nurofen hoarders as well... and I've already grabbed a pack of pseudoephedrine from the chemist while i was there buying the stuff I forgot to bring away. Today going into a tourist site here in Bendigo they did the usual and asked where I'm from. ""Sydney"" I happily reply... then followed with... ""not the part of Sydney with the virus "". and we all nervously giggled. At that stage I hadn't seen the news about the dopey doctor in Toorak.Edited: 1:47 am, March 07, 2020 "

Hubby's managed to score 2 spots on a 4 night cruise Sydney-Sydney. Departs this Friday. Should I be worried? Great time for him to decide to try cruising!
"To be honest Loki I would be mildly concerned cruising currently, but I’m probably a bit paranoid due to the high profile cruise cases recently. We’re booked to go on one mid July and I’m not sure it will be happening to be honest."
"He's like a little boy with excitement; I'm less enthusiastic. It'll be Aussies only - the cruise company has put on three cruises for first responders (police, firies, ambos, SES) following the bushfires. Hubby got onto the third cruise. Here in Ballarat I'm not worried at all, but going to a big city then on an enclosed ship gives me pause."
Loki I’ve got two domestic cruises organised this year both will involve internal flights. I’m not at all concerned at this stage although if they were international cruises I might be. We’re just going to get our normal shots up to date and practice good hygiene while on board which we do anyway. Cruising is not for everyone but we’ve found it addictive.Cheers
"Re my comments in #54: I ran out of time to edit. I’ve just seen the other comments FWIW I’m like a big kid with a bloody big toy and as happy as Larry when I’m doing a cruise.Edited: 6:01 am, March 07, 2020 "
"I like getting out in nature, bird watching, snorkelling, bushwalking, gardens. I don't like movies, dining out or dressing up. I'm happy reading but my couch is as attractive as a cruise ship for that. I told him I'd give it a go, expecting he wouldn't get a spot. I'm also not comfortable with last-minute things as I'm a planner, but I said I'd go if he got a place..."
"Have folk not been filling their chest freezers with bread, buying UHT milk and baked beans by the truckload yet? That’s standard panic buying over here along with TP.I don’t go to grocery stores over here so no idea what folk are doing. I got berything I ordered in my last online order (no extra TP but did get 6 litres of UHT milk for the cupboard - don’t want to risk going without my flat whites, now that YorkFoodie taught me how to do them right!)Work has now banned all international business travel. Can’t hold N event with more than 100 people and can’t be from same business area. We’re testing all working from home one day next week to see if the remote access will hold up or not. They’re also talking about contingencies of half permanently home working. Looking forward to that conversation with my mob. So which of you want to work in the office and risk getting the virus, whilst the rest of us stay safe at home???It’s a waiting game for sure. We’ve already had an airline collapse over here (they were on shaky ground anyway) and I wouldn’t be surprised if a few more follow. Have 6 trips planned for this year. Won’t be too bothered if I have to cancel a few of them but will be gutted if I can’t get over to do the Kimberley’s cruise and the Bungle Bungles tour in May."
"I experienced what has to be the ultimate craziness yesterday.My local BBQ chicken shop gave a free roll of TP with orders! Laughing. I haven't checked on quality yet.Checking flights to visit my brother is Brisbane. He assures me it's changed a little since my last visit - for Expo 88. How much can change in 32 years?Edited: 12:31 pm, March 07, 2020 "
I haven’t checked everywhere I have been but there have been some reports of runs on baked beans and tinned fish and UHT milk. Hubby picked up some tinned milk (he likes that anyway so a good excuse) and some sweetened condensed milk for his coffee. I did notice all but light UHT and the tiny UHT milk sizes were gone at our local supermarket before I came away. Was glad I grabbed some before everyone started to panic.
"Hi,Woohoo as a self funded retiree my shares in Kleenex have sky rocketed.Thanks to Dean Koontz and ""Doomsday Preppers""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/0…Cheers,"
"Current status:In AustraliaAs at 09:00 hrs on 7 March 2020, we have 63 confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19), including 2 deaths, in Australia.28 in New South Wales11 in Queensland6 in South Australia1 in Tasmania6 in Victoria1 in Western Australia10 associated with Diamond PrincessFurther details:15 of the initially reported cases in Australia all had a direct or indirect travel history to Wuhan, China10 cases, including 1 death, are associated with the Diamond Princess cruise ship repatriation flight from Japan16 cases are reported to have had a direct or indirect travel history to Iran12 cases are reported to have had a travel history to countries including Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, Europe, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, the Philippines and Taiwan10 cases, including 1 death, do not have a reported history of overseas travel5 of these cases are associated with an aged care facility in NSW. 1 resident of this facility has sadly died.3 cases are either directly or indirectly associated with attendance at a workshop."
"Other statistics to consider before panicking.From Healthdirect.gov.au""It is estimated that each year influenza causes an average of 13,500 hospitalisations and more than 3,000 deaths among Australians aged over 50 years, which suggests more than double the number of deaths from motor vehicle accidents can be attributed to complications from influenza.The highest rates of hospitalisation are seen in children under 5 and the elderly."""
15 in Queensland ... just this morning a woman who traveled London to Brisbane via Dubai ... it's out there ... nothing will stop it.
"An Australian Defence Force member with coronavirus recently undertook day return flights from Sydney to Canberra, travelling initially on Qantas and returning later that day on Virgin Australia.It's all over the Australian media so I won't repeat it but some stories suggest even Federal Members of Parliament could be affected.So yes, to answer your question, many Australians are still flying domestically but apparently the four major airlines have suffered a drop in bookings, which is pretty much a worldwide occurrence. By how much bookings have declined is not yet known, but some multinationals have cancelled all staff travel. This often depends on the attitude of corporate risk insurers, and there's only a limited number of these in a highly specialised field."
"#63- yes from all accounts it’s out there but from all reports from Health Dept officials, the aim now is to slow the spread so as to give hospitals and Medical people The resources to cope with severe cases. Especially if the CV virus collided with the seasonal flu.So if we can all do our bit to slow the spread we can help the vulnerable plus the elderly who seem at greater risk -so if they do get really sick there will be not overloaded hospitals and overworked doctors and nurses.Edited: 3:10 am, March 08, 2020 "
"Also meant to say that family members who work for big mining companies here in Perth have in place working from home edicts in case of sickness and all non essential air travel has ceased. Imagine the same for all big companies- so to the original question, with fewer business people travelling then flights have been cut. Though of course the actual flights could be full!For a number of reasons I’m just choosing lots of road trips ( driving safety- I’m aware of big risks on road) and walks this year in beautiful WA for my travel fix!Edited: 3:42 am, March 08, 2020 "
"It's disturbing to me that the community closed the Hobart thread regarding the coronavirus. Fortunately, I just happened to see it before it disappeared, and there was enough information remaining in the thread to source the situation elsewhere. Tomorrow I expect to be cleared to travel after having postpone my trip for a month. If so, next week I would be flying into Melbourne/Hobart, with my first stop currently five nights in Hobart, a trip built around being there on a Saturday for Salamanca Market. Reading the article, yes, I'm second guessing the trip right now, even if I'm cleared to travel. Or considering if perhaps adjusting my itinerary at least. I was thinking in the back of my mind doing that anyway - holding Tasmania and Melbourne for a future trip - because with the delay it's into autumn now instead of late summer. So this is something additional to think about.Please everyone, please don't close threads with relevant information. I understand not wanting to cause fear or panics, and the situation of business owners, but traveler's need the transparency and freedom of information to assess the situation for themselves. That is why the forums are so important. Those of us that use them put an amount of trust in others that do also. Granted I'm probably no more at risk -- or as much at risk -- having to fly to LA from the east coast, be in two airports, to fly 16 hours to Melbourne. Or for that matter going to Starbucks in a few minutes two minutes from my house in a state that has no confirmed cases. Because the virus is probably here whether or not any cases have been confirmed yet. Well, assuming I can travel, I have a week to decide anyway. That's the soonest I was able to re-book my award ticket. And who knows what the situation will be anyplace a week from now. :-(Edited: 6:35 am, March 08, 2020 "
"And, scratch what I said about Virginia having no cases. First case last night. Along with first in DC.Well, I just purchased my Award ticket back from Sydney to the states for late April. My hold expires today and since it's an F ticket, I didn't want to loose it. Worse case, if must cancel, a $150 fee to redeposit miles. We'll see what happens over the next week.Incidentally, there are a good number of Award tickets available to Australia from the states, when usually there are next to none. Oddly though, almost no Award tickets available from Aussie back to the states. Kind of curious. No idea why. But I grabbed the flight now, just in case."
"I am due to be flying in to Melbourne in 2 weeks. I appreciate this thread bc, in addition to not wanting to spread illness, I’m curious if Australians in general are cancelling their autumn holidays within the country. I don’t want to be gallivanting like a doofus around the great ocean road when the nation is diligently keeping social distance by staying home"
"We, for 1 are still gallivanting around but taking advice as to touching, handwashing etc.There may be some hysterical people buried in their homes but apart from what the sensationalist media wants you to believe with their constant updates and running statistics, most people are travelling as normal.In fact, I would not be surprised to see domestic travel increase due to the putting off and cancelling of international travel."
"Mia, thanks for posting that link. That's a good, well structured and informative site and I've bookmarked it. I commend Australia for having put together a much better site than the comparable sites in the states. Far superior to the US CDC site and others here IMO."
Mstr9- you’ll have a much more relaxed trip along the Great Ocean Road if there are fewer other tourists & locals on it!I doubt we will all be hiding away like hobbits. CT Breezes - hope you have a great time here.
"I have made it as far as Lorne On the GOR and if there’s usually more tourists than this, you wouldn’t be able to move. Monday of the long weekend though so fingers crossed there’s fewer people around tomorrow. Certainly the traffic heading to Melbourne seems heavier than that heading away, so fingers crossed."
"Thanks for the feedback. Veering OT but it has started to get weirder here in the past few weeks, we have much more community spread than you guys but over 65s are being asked to stay home and not fly or go in large groups, unis are cancelling tours and preparing to go remote, we are all working from home- it's getting real!I'm doing my part to keep everyone safe by not going to the gym ;) no community spread near me but safety first."
"Snodge,I just spoke to a friend who has gotten home from Lorne. He said not as busy as Christmas but the good news is NO tour buses!"
Good for whom???This country is about to go into recession. How can decreased business be good for anyone?
"#80, don't schools use one-ply toilet paper? It's gotten more desperate than I thought!"
"I've got my toilet to hand in case public facilities have run out of loo paper, but so far I haven't needed it. I guess those who need to supply these places buy in bulk. I've got a little backpack to carry it in. Female travelling alone, you don't want to walk across a car park carrying such a valuable commodity out in plain sight, naturally. Yarramar, that's true, I've not seen any coaches, so in that respect it's been a dream run to Apollo Bay. Christmas level crowds sound pretty extreme! Apollo Bay when I came through at 4:30 was much quieter than Lorne and I've had no trouble just winging it for accommodation."
"School toilet paper you'd have to treble to get the same thickness as one of the old aerogrammes. Totally not worth the effort of stealing,"
"I saw a post on facebook today from a butcher with a sense of humour. They have brains on special this week, just for all those people who are panic-buying toilet paper. Free installation."
"I am on my way to my last round of doctor's appointments, that had delayed my trip this past three weeks. Unless something very unexpected occurs, I expect I'll be cleared to travel. I booked an Award flight next weekend (first one I could get) and have the next ~ 18 days mostly mapped out and reserved in Tasmania & Melbourne. Everything at this point is fully refundable through the end of the week. Except the $150 fee to redeposit my miles, which I'm not concerned about in the scheme of things.The thing I'd like to ask about is this. Are folks there sensing a shift in attitude about tourists? That there may be a growing fear of having them in close quarters and what they might unknowingly bring? That it has become selfish for one to travel in the current situation if not completely necessary? That in spite of needing tourist $$, right now they are becoming a burden in the midst of the looming virus crisis expected?One of my big concerns traveling now is not so much catching the virus. If that happens it happens and could happen anywhere at this point. But more so if my trip becomes a trip in vain. That I arrive in Australia just at the tipping point where pubs and restaurants are closed, activities such as boat cruises on the Gordan River or Wineglass Bay cancelled, etc. I don't even know what I'd do at the point. Would it come down to going to a grocery store to try to find something to eat in my hotel room? I don't know the answers and no one here probably either, at least for sure. But I welcome any insights/suggestions if anyone thinks or senses this is where the next few weeks will go and what tourists would do. It seems like unless I could quickly alter my trip on the fly to one of a self catering accommodation the trip would largely be in vain at that point and ruined."
"I guess I'll just prepare as if I'm traveling and make a final decision the day before my flight. I could live with some cancellations of excursions. But the restaurant and pub closings becomes really problematic. None of my reservations are for condo type units. They are all hotels & lodges, with every meal planned to be had out someplace. It'd be different if I were traveling with someone, and a set-back was a just a small misadventure. But traveling alone and not having dining options and being among people, except room service or grocery stores, would be horrible. At least for me, for a 5 week trip."
"Most rooms have small refridgerators. Pack a lightweight bowl, plate and a set of cutlery. Even if nothing goes wrong we always find that comes in handy. Maybe also one of those sharp little knives with a sheath to protect the blade - in checked baggage of course.Edited: 4:12 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"I was out and about yesterday and so it seems were many people given that it was a long weekend. Everything seemed business as usual. There was no discernable difference from any other busy public holiday.Not so sure, though, about tourist type excursions. I did hear as can be testified by Snodge. The busses along the GOR seem to have dwindled."
Clorox wipes from home.
It may be moot. Qantas just announced cancellations and equipment changes on many routes. My return flight is one of them. It's a partner Award flight so not sure how that's going to play out. Calling them now. Hopefully it's an easy fix.
"The Chinese restaurants up here as still fairly busy though, as it is the Wet season it is the low season as far as tourists go. Hotels have reported an increase in cancellations due to travel restriction from overseas. Haven't been to the airport so cannot say if the planes are full or not but normally at this time of the year the airlines have fewer flights once the school holidays are finished. Like elsewhere there is a shortage of toilet paper,"
Social distancing and hygiene are the only weapons we have to limit contagion and the duration of the pandemic. Safety and health to us all. See you when it's over. Or on the other side.Love you.
