"I'm sure there are many out there (including myself) who want to get this virus behind us so we can make travel plans. For those of you who buy travel insurance, keep this in mind. Most new policies now being written have an exclusion in them for Covid-19 illness. Gotta read the fine print. Not only will you not be covered while on vacation, but you may also not be covered should you have to cancel your trip ahead of time because of the virus."
"ted61,I think I you mistitled your post as it seems to be more about travel insurance than anyone eagerly waiting to return to Mexico. Anyway....Â¡Diviertanse!"
"Good point, and something to be sure to look for!!Keith"
"Someone posted on one of the east coast Mexico forums that Allianz has a policy that will cover travelers for the medical fallout if they contract Covid-19 on vacation but not the travel related expenses due to Covid-19 (being stuck there, cancelled flights if things shut down again, etc.). No idea if accurate as I am not planning on traveling for likely a very long time, sadly.."
"Ris...the upside is that while your waiting for that travel, your hair will look fahb-ulous!!"
Good to keep in mind. I'm thinking of booking for December-- as long as my accommodations have a good cancellation policy just in case.
"WTF, cases in Zihua have more than doubled in the last 10 days. When things should be getting better, they appear to be getting worse. I'm hoping that it's because they are doing more testing. However, in Canada there is one case for every 22 tested. In the US there is one case for every 12 tested, and in Mexico there is one case for every 3 tested. Not sure about Canada, but in the US right now, cases are on the rise in at least 20 states. Some of that is from social distancing being relaxed and a lot of it is the large numbers of legal seasonal immigrants working on farms."
"Our numbers have been pretty good here- but we currently have an outbreak at two Hutterite colonies in the south part of the province- up to about 40 cases and counting now just in those two communities. It really was just a matter of time before that happened at a colony though, with the way they live. Too bad. Other than that and an outbreak following a wake and funeral up north, things have been pretty flat here. Knock on wood it stays the same. I think there are only about 9 active cases as of today in my city of 250K."
"It's kind of like trying to grow a healthy lawn. You treat and pamper it to keep the weeds out, but it's a constant fight because the nextdoor neighbors neglects theirs and the weeds creep over the lot line into your yard."

G...F*coking Brilliant!!!! He and his fartcatchers are going to flip.
"No Babba, the Robettes have got their head buried so far up his butt that they no longer can see the light of day."
Brilliant..was wondering why someone hadn't done this before. Went on his site a few times and was taken  aback by his consistent anti America theme and his perceived role as the savior of Zihua. Personally just thought he was a nut case. We've been coming to Zihua for the last 4 years In Feb. for about 4 weeks and love it. Generally don't mix with expats or tourists if we can at all help it.
