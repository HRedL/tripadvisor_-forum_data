"We are in Antalya and my son got it today. Doctor in the hospital said it's enterevirus and to know the exact type we could make an analysis in the University hospital. But results come in a month (!) so we decided not to do it. Currently the assumption is Coxsackie. It's highly contagious, so i assume it's epidemic."
"Hi, Please could you let us know in which part of antalya you are now. , what was the name of the hotel. many thanks."
and please could you let us know how your son got it ? did he used swimming pool or kids club.please up date us with information as im traveling to antalya in 10 days time. thanks .
"never even heard of it, imagine if you get it over there airline wont allow you to travel back, a bit of a worry if taking small children, or people with low immune system, Is it a serious virus"
"some Russian papers saving antlaya unsafe for tourists are they trying to scare monger,who do you believe this is all turkey tourism needs after showing signs of recovery.Can see cost of holidays increasing especially with so called compensation companies, if you ever been ill on holiday.Suppose FCO best point for information"
"Russians love Antalya because of all the A.I Hotels. This is the sort of hoiday that is most popular with them, a hotel they can say in all day and not leave. I suppose being in these hotels and not leaving and using the pool eating the restaurants the chance of any infection is great.Perhaps now is the time to try resorts where you have B.&.B and get out and see the local area, use the beaches and eat at the restaurants. Lots of resorts like this all around Turkey.Edited: 3 years ago "
"Three friends of mine were infected with Hepatitis type A after eating at the local restaurants around Antalya, Kemer and Göynük in the last few years."
"I would always recommend a Hepatitis A vaccination before travel, especially if you like to eat seafood."
