Does anyone have info on the airport closure?Our Air Transat flight 982 from Toronto was cancelled this morning Sun. Feb. 16.Runway damage at Cayo Largo airport was cited as the cause.I assume that means no flights can leave and Cayo Largo hotel guests are stranded.Our rescheduled 6:15 am flight tomorrow morning Mon. Feb. 17 is also cancelled as the runway damage has not been repaired.....Awaiting further clarification from Air Transat tomorrow.Any info on the runway situation would be greatly appreciated....
Employee plane apparently landed today but it’s much smaller. Heard something about repaving the landing strip. Lenny
Sad news Trotter.Better to be stranded on Cayo Largo than to be stranded trying to get there. Hope things work out for you.
I'm supposed to fly in on February 28 with Sunwing. I'll be watching this closely.Thank you for posting.SS
From FB posts it does seem to be an issue with repairs to the runway. It's a bit of a rough strip so perhaps something was found that required repairs and on CL materials and workers may not be easy to deploy. I follow a few CL pages and will pass on any concrete info.
Muchas gracias Borracho for your rapid response to our crisis!It is amazing that TA members like you know more on this than Air Transat reps!Hoping the runway will get fixed soon so we can get there maybe Friday.Any updates you can provide with your intel would be greatly appreciated.
"When things like this happen it's a lot easier to accept if given accurate information. Sadly, airlines don't seem to understand this. Just tell me what the problem is and the expected timeline to resolve it. The not knowing just exacerbates things. Hope you are on the way to paradise in the morning."
"This was the statement Air Transat gave us:""Due to runway damage at Cayo Largo airport, we are under the obligation to delay your flight to ensure safe operations""Air Transat is now saying they cannot fly us there until Friday, Feb. 19 at the earliest.....we're hoping that will be happening if the runway gets repaired rapido....Any info you guys can gather is mucho appreciado!"
Well that just sucks. At least they are providing the information they have. Seems to be beyond the control of Transat.
"The runway as I remember it was the roughest recycled asphalt, crumbly mess but it worked. Since there is a paving operation on the island this year, why not do the runway?"
"My mom was supposed to return yesterday, flight delayed until today. I see it is now cancelled outright. Hope they get it sorted out. Thanks for sharing info! And yes, better stuck there where it’s warm!"
A guest there just posted there was a hole in the runway that needed to be repaired.
Our son just messaged us to let us know about the delay. He and his fiancé are stranded in Cuba. Not many details on that end either. He said it looks like a minimum of a couple of days delay.
I'm here in Cayo Largo with the second day cancellation of my flight. The 19th is not Friday? So this does not seem very real?
I'm one of those stranded people here in key Largo and feel very sorry for the ones that are trying to get here. But we also have no information
"We r in cayo largo. Are being told that air transat is arranging a ferry to havana with a plane waiting.They said tomorrow for the ferry.Air transat wint update holasun passengers??? Wesre told we must contact holasun??!! Same plane, same issue, . Customer service is a little lacking here"
Did they tell you it is a 4hr ferry ride from Cayo Largo to Batabano and then about an hour bus ride after that ????
"Take Gravol for the ferry ride. They use the big tri-marans for that run, don't they?"
"Yes, holds about 250 people. Bring something to eat, etc. as nothing is available. No alcohol allowed. You get a seat and that is about it, there are tv screens if they are working. There is a snack counter at Batabano, terminal building is small, maybe holds about 150 people."
Sure to be some horror stories when all is said and done .....Es CubaLenny
"No kidding. Doing some rough math, if they are actually going to do the ferry option - from when they leave the resorts to when they walk out of the airport in YYZ will be about 15-16 hours."
I would insist we stay until the runway is repaired. Maybe an excuse like sea-sickness?
We are on the 5.25 pm Sunwing flight on the 28thHope they get it sorted outThe staff are keen but without materials there is notMuch they can doJust hurry up and wait .
A friend of mine who is there just posted and said that a catamaran is sailing out to Havana tomorrow with 150 canadians. I suspect the damage will not be repaired for quite some time. Sorry re your trip being cancelled. Truly sucks
"We were booked on the cancelled Sunday flight from Pearson. Waiting to hear from Transat what options will be available for usIf any. Cayo Largo isn't the type of destination that lends itself well to large scale challenges. Unfortunate for those of us waiting to arrive and /or needing to leave.Edited: 10:50 am, February 17, 2020 "

"I feel so sorry for all of you who are stranded. It might be paradise there, but not knowing how you're going to get home would definitely be worrying! Rest assured, it would be in many airlines' and hotels' best interests to get this resolved asap. And air transportation safety is huge. Maybe this will highlight some gaps, or lack thereof, in CYO's runway maintenance practices. Thank goodness it was identified and the worst case scenario did not happen...I am booked for Feb 23-Mar 1. Air Transat just advised to wait a few days - if the airstrip is not repaired by Friday, I will be entitled to a full refund. But can also book a later trip at same hotel for no cost difference. They said they are monitoring closely and to call back each day for updates.Good luck to all the Robinson Crusoes! I hope your return to Canada goes as smoothly as possible - what an adventure!Edited: 11:15 am, February 17, 2020 "
"for all of the people stranded there, are you stuck at the airport, or do you get to go back to your hotel?"
Amazing what the impact of social media can do huh? A lot of us have friends there also so I find it does help a lot as well. I am really sorry you are missing out on the chance to get there this time but I also think that it is much safer that way for you and your family.

What a waste of comment and so not compassionate for the people involved.
We have received a full refund from Hola Sun and are searching for another destination....Who knows when the Cubans will get this runway repaired. and how well will they fix it....Cayo Largo is not the place to go with this uncertainty...
"i was told that it may reopen Feb, 26th. I was scheduled to fly out 16th and then 17th and I am on hold with Transat as we speak. Seems like a very unusual reason. Too bad."
"Like Florida, Cayo Largo is limestone and has sink-holes. At the very least, the runway is so close to sunken portions of the island that the occasional soft spot shouldn't be considered unusual.Alarming for some? Yes, but it's the nature of the geology that also gives us those glorious beaches.have a look:https:/…article232235667.htmlEdited: 1:11 pm, February 17, 2020 "
"That's very nice and considerate of you Solo traveler :)for the person that asked we never had to go to the airport we've been here are beautiful Bella Isla Hotel inner same rooms for the last 2 days. I've been wondering around going to the beach and generally enjoying Paradise a little longer than I meant toAnd to the other person who commented yes it is very frustrating not knowing . Whence they let you know you have the day, not so bad!! But it's going to be difficult for my workplace for sure. I had planned to have an extra day buffer after I got home since last year it took two extra days to get home from Varadero as well because of a ice storm in Toronto we ended up in Fredericton for two nights! So nothing against Fredericton but I'd have to say this is better."
Lucky you are in Cayo Largo. Anywhere else in Cuba they likely would have bused you to the nearest working airport and you would be home by now.
We are hoping to leave tomorrow on the ferry to Havana. The Italian group did manage to leave this morning in all.
Apparently there is a section of the airport that got damaged. They closed the airport. We get to use the same room for the last 2 days. It's nice to be stuck here but we are anxious to get home
"it's not a big deal for me if I was stuck in CL, as long as I at a resort for my stay."
Oh no!! Where are you? I'm at Bella Isla. Did the air transit rep just tell you that?I was wondering if they were going to make us wait until more people would fill a ferry... Yikes
Oh no not again... this is like groundhog Day! it would be an improvement to find out today we don't go tomorrow rather than waiting to find out halfway through the day tomorrow. Who told you that? The air transit rep?
We are at Sol. The rep just told us. They still don't have the ferry for us TS983. Promise 9pm update again
You mean to fly here. I don't think so.
A pretty good-sized plane just took off and flew over my building!
Friends of ours were to fly out fri from To.stayed for two nights in hotel. They are home now awaiting.
will it not take about 7 hour to do 100 nautical miles by sailboat into Havana from CL? doing 3 to 7 knots per hour depending on weather and how good the crew is?
HC check #16
the Air Transat rep this morning said the people in Toronto would have their vacations cancelled refunded or given an option to go somewhere else no Jets will be landing here anytime soon
"hc, I would think that the boat has an iron headsail, aka a motor."
Hola chica When they say catamaran I think they mean twin Hull ferry and I'm guessing it would go to a Batabano
"my guess is they will ferry them into closest mainland port from CL and bus into Havana airport if they're flying out of there.Edited: 5:51 pm, February 17, 2020 "
It's still a long trip. Hope everything works out for them.
"I am also booked on the Feb 23 flight from Pearson, staying at the Villa Marinera. I hope everyone is safe and gets home in decent time. I also hope it's all fixed by then. Although I am doubtful it will be repaired by then."
My sister was supposed to leave Saturday - they have been told today no flights for the entire week.
"We have friends are that are scheduled to fly to CL with Sunwing on Friday Feb. 21 and with Air Transat on Sunday, Feb, 23....Both airlines will not tell them if the flights will go as scheduled,,,,they say check with us tomorrow,,,,,brutal communications by the airlines.One thing is clear, no one knows when the runway damage will be repaired to international standards and be approved for heavy jet airplanes.Has anyone gone to the airport to actually observe the runway repairs that are supposedly taking place?  ie: workers, shovels , big trucks in motion, excavators?"
"How is your money and your clothes hanging out . If your like me and the wife we only take so much cash ( for my smokes, and tips ) and only so many clothes. I mean , sooner or later you start running out of clean shirts and underwear."
"Debbie which airline told your sister this? Sunwing is denying any alerts of repairs and won't let customers change their travel plans yet. :(Edited: 6:57 pm, February 17, 2020 "
That's just Sunwing's way to keep their bookings.
"Absolutely Twotter,We need some one there to report back, in a responsible way!"
Here we go with the Sunwing BS ..... ??None of the airlines that fly into CL can tell anyone anything because they don’t f***ing know anything. It’s another Cuba communication problem not the Canadian airlines !! Lenny
Hola sun just posted on their website that flights are canceled on 23rd. I'll have to wait until I speak to our travel agent tomorrow morning.
"hola :) Thanks for the lol, reply #62. It is like they forgot they are in or going to Cuba, lo siento. buen buen dia! :)"
Materials equipment and manpower are all key items here. If they don't have one of these the other two will have to wait. I am assuming this was an unscheduled event. Let's say they they don't have the materials to affect the repair. So now they go to the guy that gets them he goes to the guy that has them then they have to get them there. Lot's of people involved here and let us not forget it is Cuba so the government would also be involved. As said above the airlines would not be kept in the loop only in the dark. As far as that goes the people in Cuba doing the job likely don't know how long. The only true indicator I see is people leaving the island on a boat. That would leave me to believe it could be awhile before the airport is operational again.
There you go at least Hola Sun appears to be a bit more on the ball with some info. As said above we need boots on the ground to give us a report of the damage.
most of the info on this issue is posted on Facebook page cayo largo airport updates.
"I don't have Facebook. I've called the company that sold me the vacation package and they are unable to provide any information regarding my Feb. 28 flight to Cayo Largo. It's a holiday and most staff are not working. I hope to receive more information tomorrow when they are back in business. However, it sounds like they won't be able to provide an answer for that date. I'm all about safety first. I would just like to know if I need to move my vacation to another location. The wait is killing me.I wish those who are still on the Cayo all the best in your travels home. Safe journey to all.SS"
and the travel companies won't know much for a few days.
According to the “ International Civil Aviation Organization “ the airport will be closed until February 26th. This was posted on the Pelicano FB page. Lenny
Thank you so much Lenny.SS
"Departed Cayo Largo to Toronto Fri Feb 14th after midnight.. Three flights were leaving that night and I was on the last Sun Wing flight that was 2 hours late leaving Toronto. When the plane got to Cayo Largo the runway lights were turned on and then they were turned off shortly later. We sat for another couple hours with the usual no information and the display boards all showed everything on time. The plane landed ~4 hours late and the captain later advised the passengers that they diverted to Varadero for fuel as they did not have enough fuel while the runway was repaired. Guess we were the lucky ones, then again sounds like we probably should ntot have taken off."
"I'm sitting here waiting for the update from air transat rep, I'm really hoping we can leave tomorrow! There are older people here, not sure how they are going to manage on the ferry. I heard it's pretty cold in open sea water, over 4 hours + one hour bus ride to the airport. My husband gets very sick on the big cruise ship so I am pretty nervous."
Just wondering what would happen in this situation with travel insurance that had been purchased for a certain time period. I suppose you would need to call and extend your plan?
Depending on the travel insurance your coverage might buy you a small plane transfer to Havana and your ticket home.
"We were told once we get off in Toronto. Air transat will give us the form to put our claims in. There are people with connecting flights to Germany, Vancouver, Calgary...We will be missing # work days, not sure how many days now :("
"Possible, but I would also want coverage for any medical emergency past the date I purchased for."
First I want to wish everyone well and I hope you get home safe and soon. Sounds like many will be traveling by boat and for those I wish you calm seas for the vogage. Some I'm sure are making the best of it but I'm also sure it's difficult on others.We left Cayo Largo just 9 days ago and if it were us I'd roll with it and enjoy the extra days. My wife on the other hand would be having a difficult time with this. Take this as a reminder to always take several days of extra medication with you. And extra cash. Since everything comes in by boat that could really cause an issue if there is equipment or materials that they do not have on the cayo to make the repairs. This may explain why it's going to take so long.
"So the rep didn't come back tonight which they said they would, we were waiting! Yes,there are people running out of their medication and cash! What frustrating is the uncertainty! There is also rumors that they might shutdown the resort soon."
I heard from my parents that said a group of Italians were ferried to the mainland to catch a flight out of Havana but had ++ trouble with the port authority. Anyone know if they made it to the airport/home?
"I did hear that a group of Italians left by boat today but nothing more. I figure there about 1300 rooms on Cayo Largo. Things were pretty quiet during the first week of February but there has to be at least 1500 people that need to be evacuated. If that's going to be by boat, that's at least 6 trips. Even at 2 trips per day thats 3 or more days. Or perhaps they can employ more than one boat?Edited: 10:00 pm, February 17, 2020 "
"The port authority has much more stringent rules, you are travelling Cuba to Cuba within their territory and their rules not getting on a plane and that particular airlines rules. The Cayo is no where near capacity so the numbers are considerably less. There are 3 boats, 2 are running at this time, however there is the daily maritime transportation from Isla to the mainland to be considered as well for specialist appts. etc, that the same is used for."

"Wouldn't surprise me, shortly before or right before flight cut off. Deals maybe to be had."
My estimates were based on 60% capacity. Good to know that that there are 2 boats running. That should get people moved out in short order. My first thought was that they would move people to La Isla and fly out of Nuevo Gerona. Must be a reason. Could be a good deals in your future Kelly. Perhaps in mine.
So far Villa Marinera $718 with no ss. Was 718 no ss then changed to $688 plus ss to equal the same @718. The pricing dept at all the tour operators and airlines are vicious scumbags.
"We were told last night that there are logistical problems we might have an update at 8 a.m. but don't worry about having your luggage packed. So I don't know what you're talking about, there being two boats running?"
"We still can't go today :(. The Italian group still at the airport, apparently they got into a hotel last night. With the way it's going we might be here until Friday. Not good at all!"
"That's definitely not professional. We were to fly out Feb16th. Arrived at the airport to discover this episode. The airport limo took us home (2 hours away) free of charge then advised us to return the following day. The whole time no updates on Air Transat website. In fact it still showed the plane leaving Toronto. The following day instead of driving back to Toronto, we called Air Transat. We were told ""no flights"" this day either. Watching this forum, talking with Air Transat and Hola Sun tours, we are now making other vacation arrangements. Unfortunately we booked Cayo Largo for 2 weeks...now were down 3 days waiting for any kind of news. I don't blame the airline for the mishap in CL, but i do blame them for not keeping passengers informed of delay before we all drove to the airport. I online check in a t 3pm on Feb 16, with no word of any delay. Even at the airport waiting to be told of conditions in CL, Air transat website, where they tell you to check your flights, was still showing the flight was leaving and on time. That was the frustrating part....lack of communication or no communication by Air Transat before getting to the airport."
I think the problem lies with the Cuban authorities. They work so slowly. They can't arrange the ferry for all of us since Sunday. We didn't know about the runway damaged until Monday morning.
The lack of communication is quite often related to the information they have been provided. If Cuba isn’t providing info how are the airlines to pass info along ?Lenny
I would rebook to go to another place if I were you. We get very limited information here as well. Absolutely they can't fixed the runway in a week. The small private plane still comes.
@91 Ditto
"Time to enjoy a day at the beach...no more news on going home, no narcotics in Cuba, docs in Canada can only supply so many, can’t give us “extra” to bring. So those who say “bring extra medication” well I brought all extra regular daily meds I could. If anyone has any extra pain narcotics they can “spare” we would love to chat because we are limping around. We are doing our best at managing but my special cream that I could not bring for jail reasons that helps me immediately I could really really use right now. Unfortunately they don’t allow that stuff out of the country either. We will make the best of it...yoga is at 9"
@94 Commiserations Enjoy the yoga at least!
Bring a bag of concrete with yiu
"Why is everyone putting blame on airlines ,it's Cuba they have to boat in equipment and manpower safety first extended vacation on island no big deal"
Some of us can't afford not to work hola chica
You guys are making it sound like your stuck on a cruise ship quarantined in your rooms enjoy.
"It seems to be the lack of communication that upsets people. Even telling them that there is no news as they are waiting for Cuban authorities to update is better than reps not showing up and flights still saying on time. However it is what it is. Not sure if we will make it in a few weeks as the Pelicano Facebook page mentions talk of Transat cancelling remaining few flights until fall. Hope that is just rumour. I feel sorry for those stuck on the resorts. For some it’s a welcome extra few days of vacation, but those that have children at home being babysat and for those running out of meds, and the people like me who don’t get paid if you don’t work, it’s a worrying time. Hope it’s resolved quickly. I heard there is a boat with supplies and labourers on its way."
"It's the uncertainty that's upsetting, I'm sure. If I was told I'd be delayed for 3 days, I'd be able to make plans, stretch medications and adjust my home schedule. and try to enjoy our extra time in paradise."
I would take Cayo Largo over a cruise ship any day.
102Is it really impossible for you imagine any situation where this would cause a problem for some people?

"Exaclly. Air Transat ""totally cancelling all flights"". Sunwing say ""pending"" for this Friday/ Saturday. How can that be? They"
Sunwing is terrible. We r booked to go Friday 21st .We know 100% we will not be going. How can all other tour operators cancel but sunwing won't. This is how you piss alot of customers off.
"Has anyone gone to the airport to actually observe the runway repairs that are supposedly taking place? Instead of speculating from the resort, can someone please take a taxi over to the airport and see what is happening....ie: workers, shovels , big trucks in motion, excavators?"
Tried to book for the following week.All flights cancelled.
For 100 CUC I'd be on that plane in a heartbeat!
"@109) just get on that small plane...lol......did that in Jamaica, from Port Antonio to Kingston...I was in the back, husband and pilot in the front...had my head down the whole way...we get close to the Kingston airport, pilot says see any planes in our way....boy that was fun.."
"@109, don't sweat the ""small"" stuff. Light aircraft have advantages, witness the fact they can get in and out of Cayo Largo airport despite the current conditions. Most are pretty STOL (short takeoff and landing), so when there is a problem they can put down in much shorter space than a jet, plus they are a lot better for sightseeing. I would jump on the chance to do that Cayo Largo/Havana trip just for the enjoyment of it! ;-)"
wish this happened a month ago when we were there - I'd gladly wait it out as long as they'd like to keep us at the resort!
I'd expect some super deals from Varadero and Havana this week.
We are booked for the 21st also. Sunwing said wait for a call from them to say it’s cancelled. Could be 10 minutes or 3 days.
No one should be adventuring out on the runway. We are tourists and let them do their jobs. I dont think that is a very good idea
"hola :) i no shouldn't butt. No one seems to be saying 'adventuring' out on the runway. You go at night, wear dark clothes put coffee grounds on your face, sneak around the airport and see what is going on with that runway. lo siento. buen buen dia! :)"
There's a public road that runs a good length of the runway starting behind the Casa del Habana (rum and cigar shop) just past the turtle farm. Anyone can rent a 4-wheeler and check out the runway work.
That's a crazy one Manitoba man :) I guess a visual is important but you could get shot or at the least attacked by a Cuban Shepard :) It's also a crazy one in Cayo Largo with no airport and somebody in Cuba has to fix it asap :) A small plane shuttle to a big plane airport looks like the only option right now...hopefully somehow it's just another week tacked on to their vacation :)
"If one wanted to look at the runway, could likely get that done with binoculars, or a superzoom camera, at least enough to see whether things are being worked on...."
"As others have said, that airport is very easy to get a look at without going somewhere that you shouldn't."
It will be me sneaking around the runway at night next time down to put a bigger hole in the runway. For me a few extra days in Cuba for free would be like the promised land. You could easily get right up to the fence alongside the runway. Get one of those quads cooler bag full of cristal and make a day of it.
"Good to hear. Hope you have calm seas. Should be an interesting adventure and I hope all goes relatively smoothly for you!Did you see post 15? Looks like a sweet ride!Edited: 5:27 pm, February 18, 2020 "

"HC.., I believe a boat that size holds a lot more than 100 people."
Actually holds about 250. As I said the boats are the same just 10 years older just like the resorts.
ok 250 people ^^^
"Good way to put it, 13."
"Im supposed to fly out of Mtl on the 21st bound for CL, called sunwing this evening because I heard about the runway issues. they were not aware of any problems and told me my flight was still good to go. I told the lady to check with air transat due to what id heard (buddy is an agent) and she then informed me that sunwing would email me tomorrow morning to let me know what my options are and that my info was correct. No flights from or to CL until feb 26th earliest. frustrating when your carrier is not even aware of the problems and you're the one to report it to them!!"
I have a Facebook message from sunwing as I inquired with them about my trip for the 28th of Feb and they told me it will be canceled and to have my agent call them about getting it changed.
"Sunwing is notorious with not knowing. In 2012 after hurricane Sandy, our favourite resort Bucanero in Santiago was destroyed. I already saw pictures of whole resort being gone and Sunwing rep on the phone was absolutely sure we are still going there and nothing wrong with our reservation."
"They were a little more concerned about the clients IN Cuba than the ones checking on their upcoming trips IMHO. LennyEdited: 10:20 pm, February 18, 2020 "
Perhaps sunwing was having to pay for the extra days in the resorts. Canceling your trip down they already got your money for doing nothing.
Our February 23rd flight down was canceled today! Very disappointed.
"Got a promised full refund from Air Transat today. Booked an AC package to Cayo Guillermo leaving on Tuesday. Looks just as desert islandish as CL. Let’s hope!I’m glad the return is being resolved, at least for some! Love the fantasies about checking out the runway repairs. Don’t let the local law enforcement catch you ... remember Midnight Express!!!"
"I have sent official Cuban and Canadian documents to Sunwing. Both documents showing the closure of Cayo Largo airport. Also have sent them the cancellation from both Air transat and hola sun.and finally if this wasn't enough a note from our friend and manager at the sol of the closure. We r booked to leave Friday and still nothing from Sunwing. Absolutely disgusting customer relations with Sunwing. Will be sure to let everyone on social media, all Canadian newspapers and of course all Canadian television news stations about how terrible this Canadian Company treats their full payed customers."
A totally despicable company that seems to go above and beyond with the worst customer service on the planet.
"Spoke to a couple of friends that were leaving this week, and next week looks like everything should be fine by Feb. 28th"
Maybe yes - maybe not lol!
The report I saw on Facebook last night says to contact your travel agency or on ground representative who will help you. There isn't a lot being said other than it's repairs needed.
The hole in the runway has been getting bigger for days. Runway is now closed to large aircraft until Feb 26 for repairs. Guests will be taken to Batabano by ferry and bussed to Havana for their flights home. Emergency and domestic commuter aircraft may use the runway safely.
"I just read a Canadian Government statement, stating. The runway is in need of repairs and will not be fixed till February 26th."
My brother has been calling for 2 days. They told him to show up at the airport and if the flight was cancelled they would give him another destination. WTF???He told them HE would like to pick out his vacation. They obviously don't like the fact of returning peoples money.
@152 you seriously believe that ????I wonder how many people whining about information actually booked with a travel agent ?Lenny
"Wow I just read the notice put up at the Pelicano by Transat. Departure from resort. 1.30pmDepart Cayo Largo on ferry which holds up to 300 people and will serve food and non alcoholic drinks 4pm trip will be 4 - 4.5 hours Coach to Habana 1 - 1.5 hours Flight departure 11.45pmArrival Toronto 3.25Total travel time 14 hours !That’s a long day , pretty sure I would take the $100 flight if available. Lenny"
Believe me everybody would like to take the hundred-dollar flight if it was available!! I'll just have to embrace the adventure like everybody else on the bus/boat/bus/plane.Even people who had booked excursions to Havana on smaller planes were cancelled as one airline for locals is flying in and out but not the slightly bigger plane for excursions.
The Canadian government site says estimated reopening for this airport is Feb 26
"just had to cancel our trip with Air Transat for Sunday departure , the opening on Feb 26th date is not firm , Cuban Time. Why AT tried to direct us to Varadero and then want to charge us $300 more is not customer service so we took a full refund. Not going back with Air Transat again and we used them for Greece last Sept and enjoyed the long haul flight."
"Wow. I'm now reading about sunwing and how they are getting customers TO cayo largo. Apparently (and this could be a rumor) they are flying them from Canada to Havana, then by bus, then on the catamaran to Cayo Largo. So that 10 minutes from airport to resort is now, what...something like an extra 7 hours travel time? You might have to be a member of the group to see the pic though, they are dressing up the marina...why, if people are leaving is what they're saying: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php…The fb group is : Hotel Pélicano Cayo Largo les voyageurs"
"hola :) I'll say it, but i'm just sayin it. That runway might not be open to large planes for maybe 6 months maybe even 1 year. Maybe. buen dia! :) ps - hope the ones that are there get home safe and sound."
"I'm at the airport, just checked in our luggage and sitting in the waiting area. I guess we will wait here until our ferry time in 2 hours in an air conditioning room. I did try to look out to the runway. I don't see the damage part, could be at the other end."
Safe travels !
All the best for your journey home VandDMom.SS
"@159 I would think its faster for Sunwing to fly in from Toronto to cayo largo via Cienfuegos or Trinidad airports ferry across to CL, but what do I know about logistics.Edited: 4:59 pm, February 19, 2020 "
"My parents were supposed to fly home to Toronto last Sunday. Today, they took a ferry to the south of Cuba's main island, then a coach to Havana. They are supposed to be catching a flight from HAV to YYZ at 11:45 PM tonight getting into YYZ at 3:25 AM. Apparently, smaller planes (puddle jumpers) are able to land at Cayo Largo's airport. Not sure what is going to happen with the people that got there on Feb 9th for 2 weeks... I hope that Transat compensated you nicely. Doesn't seem like they gave you much of a chance to rebook another trip?"
"Info re: SunwingWould imagine their alternate offering my contain the word ""Memories"" in the resort name.https:/…"
"Surprisingly there’s not a Memories on the list !!!SCG , MJDR or Valentin in Cayo Cruz. Lenny"
Must be more cheaper to purchase rooms at those hotels than putting people up in their ( so to speak) resorts.
"MJDR is a Big Resort the others not so much.MJDR is offered very cheap from our neck of the woods, Scares me !"
"Actually, Lenny , you are correct . Caribe was not offered, certain weeks, sold out"
"Not to put a damper on everything, just got a message from CL, that while waiting at the airport after leaving the resorts and waiting to go to the boat, one of the clients had a heart attack and passed away. A very sad ending for all that has transpired for that group. I wish it not to be true."
Terrible news. Those poor people ....Lenny
"Oh My gosh! I can't Imagine ,Very High anxiety! Hopes and Prayers !"
That is all so terrible!
Welcome home....one to remember I'm sure :)

"Sunwing is lying to you, as my brother was to be on your flight. I was to be on the a flight this past Sunday and that is when we were told. I let my brother know and he immediately called Sunwing and that was Monday....they have known. They just don't want to give you your money back and book somewhere else with another carrier. They are gonna wait till the very last minute and offer an ""exchange"". That way your still on the hook of using them."
Good on you for your sympathy - others here are focussed on missing out on their holiday departure but what you describe puts things in sad context.
"Yesterday, I booked mar. 20th for $819 total 7 days single rate from yyz at Villa Iguana. Didn't know about the airport then and nothing was said by transat. Keepig finger crossed. Wondered why it was so cheap."
"Really sorry to hear the news of the passing at the airport of that gentleman. That is a terrible tragedy and my condolences to his family and friends.,"
"A tragic outcome for sure. And a wake up call for anyone who thinks they will get immediate medical care in Cuba, or for that matter any vacation destination that doesn't feature modern hospitals and ambulances. Yes, take more medication than you need in case of incidents, and be aware of your stress tolerance if things go awry on your vacation. That said, you can never be sure that the outcome would have been any different with prompt medical attention. Doesn't always work out in real life the way it does on TV shows."
"This is a wake up call for those that travel with medication and general conditions where one is travelling to, regarding medical care. A very tragic ending, RIP"
Glad you are finally back home. You've had quite an adventure and thank you for having us follow along. It's been an interesting story and you've also provided some good information along the way. Salud!
Only heavy equipment at the airport there is for gardening. And a fire truck. There’s a crane at the marina to lift the sea cans. Don’t let anyone fool you. No repairs are being done yet.
And the freighter from Isle of Pines hasn't been reported as arrived yet.
"This tragedy left an affect on both my spouse and I as we trevelled on this Cuba flight. We are sorry for this gentleman's family and friends, and his journey's end. Prayers and thoughts."
Working on the runway now. Hopefully repaired sooner than later. Gran Caribe don't need any more bad publicity.
I was reading this morning on a newspaper from Montreal people that are in Cayo Largo complaining because it will be a long ride in a Catamaran to Varadero and some are scared they will get sea sick I can understand its not fun for some tourists but I guess some people will never be happy with whatever the situation is .You want to get home get in the Catamaran and you will get home sooner .What do they want Transat and Sunwing do fix up the Airport themselves .
"It's a long thread to read for the answer.... was it a sinkhole like Spunky mentioned earlier as a possibility?Edited: 3:43 pm, February 20, 2020 "
"Cayo Largo is a rather remote destination that we are fortunate to be able to visit on a direct flight from Toronto and Montreal. Fixing a runway in Cuba is difficult enough but on Cayo Largo the problem is multiplied. It does seem that people were left in their rooms, told to try to enjoy their day while a plan to get them home was worked out. Not an easy task from Cayo Largo as there are no easy options to get the large number of people involved back home. The logistics of finding the solution could not have been easy and certainly a couple days to muster the resources was reasonable.Edited: 4:01 pm, February 20, 2020 "
"About 5 or 6 years ago the fellow in my neighboring room passed away after experiencing a heart attack. We had been on a tour at the time and were told of this incident upon our arrival back to our room. Incidentally this incident happened in Cayo Santa Maria but, unfortunately had the same results.I have been a Red Cross First Aid / CPR / Defibrillation instructor for the last 10 years of my retirement. After discussion with our butler we found that very few resort workers knew how to perform CPR. So, after hearing this I proceeded to instruct our butler and maid on how to perform CPR. I also sent them a first aid book for them to learn and teach others.I will teach whomever wants to learn. You never know when it will be needed - maybe for yourself."
I have not read any updates on the issue is Sunwing planning to bring booked customers to cayo largo this week via a ferry ride from Varadero or Havana? or did they Canx bookings.
Info re: Sunwinghttps:/…
Going by what I see here at least Hola Sun and Air Transat made some attempt to keep people informed. Didn't see no letters from Sunwing in the article.
"After reading the article and just seeing it on CityNews, you would think that those with medical needs would be the first to leave the island."
Someone said earlier that they seen some construction equipment on the dock in Cayo Largo. Hopefully the trucks were carrying material to make the repairs.As I said before it will be a logistics nightmare. Even getting everyone home I do not recall ever something like this happening before. On the big island you could have just been bused to the nearest operating airport.
@208 I would have taken it one step further and got one of the smaller planes to bring in any required medication. The lack of facility's and infrastructure on the small island is now out in the open for everyone to see.
Does anyone know how long it takes for a runway to cure? Something tells me it won't be opened on the 26th...
"Maggie, when highways are re-paved here, it only takes a few minutes before cars are driving on it."
"Of course, but 100,00lbs of airplane slamming into one spot is a bit different."
We were on the flight down the week before the plane hit so hard we all kissed the ground when we got off. Even the traditional hand clapping upon landing did not start tell the thing got slowed down.
"Just to reiterate, you really need to bring enough medication with you in case of such a situation. You cannot rely on being able to get what you need in Cuba, or indeed anywhere, as one's prescription isn't likely to be filled in a foreign country without consulting a local doctor and getting a new script.As far as runway repairs, count me among the people who think it will be awhile...."
"People were understandably upset, however their situation pales beside that of folks stuck on a cruise ship in Japan. I wonder how many of them will be up for another cruise anytime soon??"
"It's always been a rough runway and I'm really curious about exactly what the problem is. Is it a bad patch that can be repaired or does the entire airstrip need to be redone? Questions with no answers anytime soon I'm sure. We'll be back again assuming that flights eventually resume. If there's a place where I have a high tolerance for putting up with things, it's Cayo Largo.Edited: 7:42 pm, February 20, 2020 "
"#217 Yes, but that's a seperate issue and not relevant here."
"#218, my understanding is a concrete slab has shifted in the runway effectively shortening it from 3km to 1.2 km due to the location of the damage. It's not a ""pothole"" and plans are to resurface the entire runway and at the same time do major road repairs on the island. So no, I highly doubt it will be open again this season."
"@207, if you didn't see the cockroaches then you weren't sitting on the right side of the ferry! They were so many of them near the washrooms. In my opinion the ferry crew did try their best under the circumstances."
For asphalt it is more a matter of cooling not curing. Depending on the mixture the outside temperature and the compaction two days should be enough. Actual curing will take up to one year.
"#221, You obviously missed the sarcasm in that... Yes. There were many cockroaches. Far too many cockroaches."
"Also @221, yes, I agree *almost* everyone did their best under the circumstances, Cayo Largo airport staff excluded, see earlier comment, the problem lies with those that created or allowed the circumstances in the first place. Several years or complaints about the runway being ignored to the point planes can no longer land, poor communication between the tour groups and their reps, lack of information through official channels in the Cuban authorities... the list goes on. I understand, it's Cuba. But when you are relying on tourism you should make every effort to look after the tourists."
As more information becomes available it only gets worse. A sink hole is just a hole. Remove any unstable material around the hole repair it. Shifting that's different why did it shift how much actually shifted will more shifting occur in other parts of the runway. This will require engineers to determine the correct form of action to be taken once they start digging it up.
"Magg, I think you would need geologist first to take soil samples if there is a sinkhole in runway to assesses the situation at the airport in CL, a good size crew with modern machinery working day and night I would think 5/7 days to patch it up ready to go, but I'm not an engineer just a wild guess.Edited: 8:33 pm, February 20, 2020 "
Cockroaches survived the ice age. They are hard little buggers to kill.
Has anyone thought that this damage might have resulted from the earthquake that occurred a couple of weeks ago? Just wondering.I just read an account of the return nightmare trip reported by CTV. My heart goes out to everyone who endured the horrific trip and especially to the friends and family of the man who passed away. So tragic!
Dig test samples dig test samples and repeat till the engineer signs off. Someone said it was a shift in the concrete this makes the process ten times worse than a simple sinkhole. First question are they going for a bare bones quick patch that will not last or something that at least has a chance. Minimum i would say one month could take as long as one year. Everything has to come by water just to get the materials there. Would you use just in time or stockpile. The list goes on. Best guess is to not guess at all just go with the flow and hope for a miracle.
"#226, the geologist would find it is coral limestone. A sink-hole or any sunken depression is a big deal on a coral island."
Sorry it is just a sinkhole. Drilling test holes will determine if there are any more cavities under or around where the sinkhole occurred. After that a compression test is done to determine the compaction of existing material. If there has indeed been a shift an earthquake may just be the reason behind it.
I think all you experts should hop on next flight to assist.Just kidding jajajaja. I do enjoy the speculation since that's all we have right now.
I am not just speculating I have built more roads and foundations than I care to remember. But I would gladly take up the invitation to go down and assist. Be the best damn runway in all of Cuba. Trouble is if I was to stay there till it was finished it would take forever to complete.
I would never claim to be an expert on anything but I know someone who is. Calls himself the full package. Just ask him about anything he'll tell ya.
"But we don't have an assessment of the condition of the runway and what prompted the closure. Therefore everything is speculation. But I do appreciate the expertise and opinions. No disrespect intended.Edited: 9:19 pm, February 20, 2020 "
None taken. I would gladly go down and provide a full and accurate assessment for room and board and of course a few cold beers.
"I think that building a road or a runway on a coral island with no real soil or gravel is a challenge. Add to that, the runway is partially built on a filled-in lagoon and has two distinct water courses that were filled in with either coral or sand or both. Anyone who's ever taken the road to the big beaches knows you go up a coral outcrop and down though a sand filled hole and repeat 6 times.But, I'd volunteer if Ratwalto wants to come along.LOL"

For sure Spunky you read up on coral I will do the rest. Okay with swamp clay limestone shale etc. but coral would indeed be a first for me. Maybe Mike can join us should take a couple of weeks for Mike and I just to sort out the sinkhole thing. If we gotta go might just as well milk it.
Having circumnavigated that airstrip several times I understand what you are saying. To most it's probably just an uninteresting chunk of rock. I've always had an interest in geology so if there is an expedition in the planning - count me in!
We will just include a supply of scrunchies and toothpaste in our materials request. Anything is possible with me and Spunky runnin' the show.
We would also need K down there for security.
We will put it on a container ship out of BC. Should take about what two months or so to arrive. We will have to wait.
"That would be 2 weeks, Cuban time, eh?"
@ 243 You can be the big word guy. If we all draw a blank and can't figure out what to do next you can throw around a few that nobody has heard before. That should give us another month til they catch on.
Everything we be in Cuba time for sure.
"I'll walk around and talk confidently. Should buy us a couple weeks at least. That will give us time to figure things out and they'll be amazed at what what will be accomplished, by Cuban standards and timeframes.Edited: 10:01 pm, February 20, 2020 "
We will be called the white hats from Canada.
"Selfless volunteers working up to 6 hours a day to save the Cayo from financial ruin and protecting the livelihood of hundreds of Cuban workers. It's a noble cause.Edited: 10:14 pm, February 20, 2020 "
Che would approve!
It's an ugly job for sure. We will all have to endure the harsh conditions for such a noble cause.
Perfect
Were the white hats Mike we don't use anything especially shovels. We only tell other people how to do it.
"Some of you may be members of a Facebook group called ""Repeat guests of Cayo Largo"" I just want to make it clear, this is a PR page run by a sales manager for Gran Caribe. Any negative posts will be removed and the person will be removed from the group."
"I’m really sorry this has happened and feel kinda responsible. It was our Transat flight that landed down on the 26th so damn hard we put a hole in the ground, started an earthquake and pretty much set the tone for the week! What a Vacay!!!! We did however make it out and I’m sorry for those who didn’t. As much as I did not want to leave, at least I could."
"My understanding is an Italian plane was the last to land and fly out. I could be wrong, and it really doesn't matter. The runway there has been in a state of disrepair for years. Our pilot commented just before landing to be prepared, the runway is rough."
I don't go on facebook but if I was to it would not be on a sugarcoated PR page run by anybody. I really don't see anything negative here anyway we are just having a little fun.Speaking for myself I would and likely will return to Cayo Largo. Her charms outweigh any small speed bumps you encounter along the way.
"Oh, I reread your post! Now I'm laughing! Yes, you caused the earthquake! It's all your fault! Although I don't think it has anything to do with that.... lol"
Too many cervesa one day and passed some gas. I think that may have caused the earthquake. So I guess I am to blame sorry.
"@263 have you read this entire thread? The more recent posts, the last 40 or 50 or so, are way less... meaningful? First 200 or so posts much more serious.Then, like most online forums, it degrades."
Everything has pretty well be said so now we just have a little fun. If you wish to call that degrading them I respect your right to do so.
@261 we were on the same plane. I was glad he got er stopped in one piece.
"@Rat, I know right ! It was nerve wracking, drank all week because of it . Who needs vacations like that? I’ll still go back tho."
The plane went dead silent after the hit. No clapping til we were halfway down the runway and the thing was slowing down. Too funny. What does not kill you will make you stronger.
Large Italian jet landed hard and damaged runway
So many theories- so little facts

28 at a time. The usual commuter prop airplane used for Havana and Varadero runs.
"What ? Really ? #279 says ""Finally we have some real news on the runway"". Question ? Is your friend the managing director of civil aviation in Cuba ? How else would she know this information ? I'm just curious. I believe this is nothing more than propaganda seeded by the same Gov't that did not release next to any information of the doomed Cubana flight # CU 972 when it crashed in 2018, as well as the damage suffered in the horrific cat 5 hurricane Irma thru Cayo Coco & Cayo Santa Maria in 2017. Come on....the authorities of Cuba are well known notorious liars / fibbers / deceivers / miss informers thru and thru to protect their tourism industry that is dwindling every week and month. They are a communist regime that suppresses most everything and refrain from issuing any negative news.I especially feel sorry for all those elderly folks and families with kids that have suffered a disastrous ending to their vacation in Cayo Largo as well as the man that passed away, probably from the anxiety of the stressful situation. RIP. Just brutal. I am just very sad to see the decline and deterioration of a beautiful country I have visited 18 times."
Were supposed to be leaving tonight.... they also keep changing the time so who knows! So far it's just Sunwing offering this as another group left this afternoon by ferry

1 of 6 is basically nothing imo
Cuba is just not the country that you travel to and expect to find medication like we do at home .Friends of mine who the father passed away who was at the Hospital for a couple of weeks had to find medication on the black market because the hospital did not have what they needed for the poor man .Imagine a tourist looking for medication in Cuba i can just imagine what they would find like this poor man did .
Yeah it's probably best to just bring all your medication with you just incase. Or atleast double the amount of medication to the amount of days your away for ... But even that might not be enough.
"personal research is always important when planning a vacation on the county your planing to visit even if you're a seasoned traveller, at times people just take travel agent advice.R.I.P."
"I never used to need prescriptions when I vacationed, but these days, I need three different medications every day. I would take a months worth with me now If i traveled. They come in a packages of 30 anyways, so why not bring more them. I don't think a weeks's worth is enough. Just look at the coronavirus situation, people are being quarantined for weeks on end. and HC is right. Gotta be prepared and not rely on others to get you out of a jam."
A lot of Pharmacies in Quebec don't know for other parts of Canada will only give you prescriptions medicine for a month only.Other pharmacies if you are lucky will give you for 2 months but not all of them will do this .I can understand why some tourists can run out of medicine as not every pharmacy that will give you extra medication just in case something happens if you still have a week or 2 of pills .
"@297 I personally don't have any medications but my wife does, she's bringing everything she has nothing is being left at home, that way she will have everything she needs if anything unforseen happens."
"We always used to take just the number of pills needed, plus a few more.....not anymore after reading this, will take more this time. Very interesting if you only have a couple weeks left before a refill, what happens. I know I tried to get my husbands refilled when I had mine, but they wouldn't refill his, said it was too early, must check into that."
"LoriM if you tell the pharmacist you are going to be out of the country then they will usually try to give you more. I know I've had to do that with my anti-seizure meds. In my case, it was my health insurance provider, not the pharmacy, that was so strict about refills."

"Audrey, thanks."
"HolaIt seems that the unfortunate circumstances that many of the travelers affected by this situation has resulted in so many other travelers making plans to take precautions for future trips that they had not really considered in the past. Like the amount of additional medication for those ""just in case"" times.While I have a year round travel insurance policy, I went back to review the policy based on the events resulting from the Cayo Largo runway closure. It might be a good idea to check your coverage. For example, my policy is for trips lasting up to 15 days. There is an automatic extension for some circumstances up to 24 hours free of charge when the delay is due to the carrier, for example, but after that, I would have to contact the insurer for an extension to the coverage, otherwise, it looks like I could be SOL. Might not be something you are thinking about when you are stressed out finding out information on how and when you are getting home....Imagine having to add that to the blend of what had turned into a tragic turn of events….Cheers"
It is the insurance company not the pharmacy. You just need to say it is for vacation and most will provide the meds. I had this happen at the beginning of the month. Green Sheild came through once they knew early renewal was for travel.Cheers
"HolaOut in B.C. the pharmacy will give you 10 days of med's if you cannot get to a doctor or plan to be out of the country, I have done this the odd time. Was quick and easy."
"sea sickness is no excuse, nurse will give you a shot of gravol !!!! I even tried booking a little plane to Havana no go. Returned home this morning it was an 19 hour adventure."

Very sad for the gentleman who passed away...RIP.. Thoughts & prayers to his familyWe're heading to CL soon. Have been wondering if we would actually make it with this runway problem. We haven't been there in a few years & this trip we'll be celebrating our 30th anniversary. Very relieved to read of the reopening. Hopefully it's not a short-lived bandaid fix. Perhaps they will revisit it during the down season.
Airport is open http://www.airportcuba.net/cayolargo.html
"hola :) Sorry to be like this, but the airport was always open, but lately not to big aircraft. It would be nice for the peephole who wanna leave and peephole who wanna visit and the Cubans with jobs there. buen bueb dia! :)"
"#313, I wish that was an official site. Sadly, there is no official site for the Cayo Largo airport. Gran Caribe has been posting that they are open but I haven't seen a notice about large jets being able to use the runway yet.Fingers crossed."
Someone needs to post a picture with a copy of today's newspaper in it (like they do for proof of life in hostage taking) and the jet on the tarmac behind it.
Nothing showing here:www.airportcuba.net/cayolargo_arrivals.html
"We will only know for certain on the 28th when the next flights are scheduled from Toronto and Montreal.Edited: 4:32 pm, February 24, 2020 "
I haven't looked but Blue Panorama has large jets (767s I believe) from Milan and Rome. Perhaps they will arrive before the 28th.
Milan passengers are being ferried via Cubana commuter airplanes to CL.
"Thanks Spunky, I wasn't aware of that. I noticed that the Feb 26th flights from Canada are restricted to Bella Isla, Sol and Iguana. The others are not being offered. On Mar 6th all of the usual resorts are on offer."
I wonder if the staff members are taking advantage of the vacancies to take some time off?
"Cuba Ministry of Tourism rep says Cayo Largo airport ready, tour ops await confirmation Monday, February 24, 2020Posted by Travelweek GroupTORONTO — A representative with Cuba’s Ministry of Tourism says Cayo Largo’s airport is ready to receive flights once again, however at least one tour operator is waiting to confirm that the repair work is sufficient for large aircraft.Carmen Casal with Cuba’s Ministry of Tourism posted an update on Facebook on Feb. 23, saying that Cayo Largo’s airport is ready to welcome medium to large size aircraft again. “Great news! The track at Cayo Largo del Sur airport is ready to receive medium and large planes. The excursions are restored. The unique and heavenly beaches of this Cuban destination are waiting for you!” said Casal in her post.Transat spokesperson Debbie Cabana says: “We are still waiting for confirmation that the type of aircraft operated by Air Transat can land and take off safely at Cayo Largo. For the moment, we still have the date of February 26 as information.”"
"Mike .., kinda sounds like the ol WW2 saying.., when the Germans fired the Allies ducked, when the Brits and Canadians fired the Germans ducked.., when the US fired we all ducked..,"
let us know how you make out with the airport. we hope you have a wonderful vacation. we are planning on booking a trip to cayo largo very soon . we have been there before and had a great vacation. maureen
All set to go for Friday - YYZ to CYO at 5:10 p.m.I have an alert set for that Sunwing flight in case anything changes.I'll try to post about the landing/runway at CYO airport Saturday the 29th.SS
Yes please let us know. Transat could not give me an update yesterday but I see they have this Sunday's flight for sale on their website. Have a good trip.
Today's arrivals:www.airportcuba.net/cayolargo_arrivals.html
Looks like the sunwing flight took off from Toronto this evening en route to Cayo Largo. Should be landing in the next hour.
Three flights landed in Cayo Largo last night from Canada. Runway now open just in time for me next Sunday
I hear Sunwing accommodated their customers however Air Transat was not going to upgrade or send you to another resort if there was a price difference. I didn't think that was right.
Accommodated how? And why?
"The airport was closed the week of Feb 23 . Our trip cancelled and the option were , refund, rebook or pay the difference if and if they could find a hotel that week . I was lucky my holidays are flexible and took a refund. I am sure others were in a more delicate situation."
If those were the options it sounds like people were indeed accommodated to the extent possible. Why should anyone get an upgrade under those circumstances?
"There are almost always 4 special seats at the a la cartes each night. All reserved in the name ""rrpp"" (guest relations) for those guests who couldn't find the plug for their sink, saw a spider in their bathroom or got cold coffee from the buffet. Some people live to be comped, LOL."
"They sure do! They seem to be growing in number and the rest of us pay for it.Edited: 6:34 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"B...but aren't almost all à la cartes at an AI included in the all-inclusiveness of the place? Or do these folks feel like they're getting a special perk by scoring an unscheduled meal at the magical à la carte? I'll bet they think the dress code is for other people, too.Anyway, I guess there is no news on the airport, aside from the fact that it's open and planes are taking off and landing just fine?"
"Many resorts allow 2 a la cartes per week so scoring an extra is a big deal for some. I saw a guest refused at an a la carte for wearing dress shorts. I wish the resorts would stick to the dress code. Couples are celebrating birthdays and anniversaries, and the staff make an effort to make the meal special and we should respect their efforts."
"Things seem to be running as normal at the airport. Hope the repairs hold up. I'm sure they get a 'special' table, are fawned over by the staff and maybe get a couple lobster tails on the house. Small price to pay for the glowing review that names the staff and the incredible job they did in looking after the 'small problem' I guess.I'm a bit of a stickler for the dress code and other rules. We all have to share space together. Gone are the days of arguing with my mom and throwing a tantrum because I wanted to wear jeans at a family gathering.Edited: 7:09 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"Totally with you on the dress code. I don't go to good enough resorts for the à la carte to be an important part of the experience. Usually they're quite pedestrian, and sometimes I don't bother with them at all. Still watching the CL airport situation closely, fingers crossed that there are no further disruptions. The whole evacuation by ferry business sounded like a nightmare."
"We rarely do à la cartes. Sometimes it's nice when you are with people that you want to spend time with and be served a couple courses but it's more about the company and spending some time together in what is usually a more quiet and relaxed space than it is about the food. I'm watching the airport situation too. We really don't know the extent of the damage to the airstrip and I'm hoping it wasn't a halfassed repair job that might require more extensive work down the road.Edited: 8:13 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"We are once again on the same page. Good for group dinners, and also for couples to break away from the group for an evening."
"That too. Yes, we are definitely on the same page. :)"
Great to hear the airport is open now.PLEASE...Can someone who landed there last Friday Feb. 29 or Sunday March 1 make a post to confirm the landing on the repaired runway was smooth and the runway is indeed repaired to handle big jets..
"I tracked some of those flights and they did indeed arrive and others departed. 737s and 767s from Italy. CYO has always been a rough airstrip. Hopefully someone will report.Edited: 2:07 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"I think Transat uses A310s or A320sEdited: 2:13 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"…""PLEASE...Can someone who landed there last Friday Feb. 29 or Sunday March 1 make a post to confirm the landing on the repaired runway was smooth and the runway is indeed repaired to handle big jets.""""Why? If the pilots deem it passable, how would interweeb's opinions affect your travel plans?"
"Yup, I'd rely on the pilots rather than the passengers."
This thread is a runway...@346 did you say/type planes from Italy have departed for Cuba or been there and departed for home...Italy's like a virus hot spot right now...?
I am referring to the Boeing 737-800 jets that Sunwing and Transat fly from Canada to Cayo Largo.Curious to find out some factual info on the nature and extent of the runway damage and what type of repairs were completed to make the runway operational.
I'm very curious too. But if they are using the runway people far more knowledgeable than me have have that call. Including the pilots who are taking off and landing there.
What about the Italian's….they could be carrying a great pasta sauce and a virus! :)
"Lucky., so their pasta is going to go viral then ?"
"I'd also like to know that kind of info so I can decide what level of confidence to have in that runway, but something tells me we won't get much more here than ""big planes are landing and taking off"". The Italians do tend to use bigger jets than the Canadian companies, seeing as the flights are transatlantic. Don't know what model(s) though.@351, yes, over 3000 people in a country of 60 million are sick with covid-19. It's a serious matter, but not yet serious enough to bring the entire world to a halt or even to stop all Italians from taking the trips they've planned."

"@355... I hope it's the sauce that goes viral :)@358...I realize that one, but I also realize that any airport is like a opportunistic virus spreader/carrier...1000's of people everyday touching things and themselves from who knows where then visiting where you're going...this virus can spread like a great Italian recipe :)"
"@360, better stay home then."
No...they better stay home! :)
"Better idea: people with cold, flu, gastroenteritis, covid-19 and other easy-to-share bugs should stay home, and healthy people should travel if they wish."
"Transat, Air Canada and Sunwing announced today their policies on ""free"" changes to our reservations due to Covid concerns:https:/…novel-coronavirus-wuhan-china.html"
@363That's the most sensible thing I've heard all day.
@363 again...yes that's what I've been trying to say but in Italian :)
"Oh sorry, I thought you were suggesting stopping all flights from Italy to Cayo Largo."
It's difficult to tell sometimes. ;)
"I think a little bit from column A.,( 367 )..,and a little bit from column B, ( 368 ) nailed it.Edited: 8:30 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"@ 370, and your takeaway from all that is that flights out of Italy (all of it?) should be suspended?It's quite possible that they will be at some point. Along with many others. Whether by government order, or because the situation will lead to too many unsold seats.We aren't there yet, though. If you think we should be there but the powers that be are taking excessive risks in the interest of protecting the economy or preventing panic, then I do think simply avoiding airports is your best bet.It's not a position I agree with, but I don't think it's a stupid position either. I might even come around to agreeing with it, depending how things unfold in the coming weeks and months.But for now, I'm still in ""wait and see"" mode and still planning on flying in the next few weeks."
"I didn't take that away AGoldfish...mind you I like the idea :) We're supposed to be trying to contain this not fly around with it...Italy is a hot spot right now as we know...not sure if the virus its spreading like a good tomatoe sauce or hanging around like a block of Parmesan...sorry, I shouldn't joke. I was just surprised to here the Italians have been to Cuba and are still coming. Regardless...I'm going in April. I might be at the airport in a breathable clear plastic bag but I'm going in April :)"
"It's interesting to watch how different countries are handling this situation. Singapore, for instance, has banned entry or transit of any traveller from northern Italy, South Korea, and Iran."
That's very interesting eeeefarm...Singapore is singing my song...it's a good/only way to stop the spread really. Cheese is also very interesting Mike :) I like the way Parmesan makes the sauce less spreadable :)
@375And so it begins.....https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-coronavirus…
"Great, thanks @377...first the Italian news now this sick link :)"
You guy's can follow...it's like I have the virus already :) Sure I may have/like a little mold but I'm not contagious just yet :) I'm thinking Italian tonight btw...something a little saucy with blue cheese :)
"Okay, maybe I am infected and hungry :) Doesn't mean I don't want company on this Italian Friday night :)"
