"The Prime Minister is going to announce new measures for the outbreak on the 10th. That might include a declaration of state of emergency. Personally, i have a trip scheduled for the 12th so i'm waiting until that announcement before making changes to my trip."

"March 10th? Gosh, that is a long time away!"
"I have plans to travel on April 2, Chicago-Tokyo and I was giving it until the 15th but looks like PM Abe might be making that decision for me. Great info Tokyoaaron."
Thanks for letting us know! My flight is for March 25th.
"My flight is today afternoon, as of now airlines not offering refunds and insurance can't claim anything so I'm going to proceed. Kind of worried I may be quarantined when I fly home on 15/Mar if the announcement on 10/Mar is anything ominous..."
"You're welcome, phaera et al!Just to be clear: Abe's announcement is official, as is the request for emergency powers.HOWEVER, as of now no-one knows what Abe will say on the 10th, or whether he will exercise any/all of the authority gained under the power of emergency.Personally, and amongst most of the locals and long-term expats I know, there's a consensus that things are going to get worse before they get better.But what that means exactly is anyone's guess...Updates on other news, nclduing the latest plans from international airlines, at Tokyo Coronavirus: Is it Safe?

"Well, there you go. We're due to fly on the 10th. Read in an english language newspaper, I believe NHK Word or Kyodo, the state of emergency will probably take effect next week friday. That would put us in a difficult spot as our travel insurance covers all cost only of we actually Are in japan then. Had we had a special ""terrorisme and natural disaster"" extension, we would have been able to cancel now. Correct me if I'm wrong but that seems totally silly to me. That means we""ll have to go anyway as there is now too much money at stake. Insurance policy .....aaargh......"
"Just remember Eddy V, the power would be granted on Friday, March 13. That doesn't necessarily mean put into practice on that day.We just don't know yet, I'm sorry to say.Hope it all works out for you."
"I don't think he will announce that we 're in the state of emergency but just say that the law is made just in case.We're a democratic country, not a totalitarian one. The Prime Minister would be wiser than declaring that, knowing what impact it would have on Japanese economy."
"Hi tokyoaaron, certainly true...we just have to wait and see which measures will be put into effect. My feelings as to wether or not to go were inclined towards just going ahead as planned. However, doubt sets in in case all temples and shrines get shut. I sense in the media here in the Netherlands that things are already getting too much out of hand and becoming very difficult, if not impossible to control. It will come to a point where we simply have to accept it and try to limit the economic damage, but we're in unchartered territory here I'm afraid.Edited: 4:43 am, March 06, 2020 "
Temples and shrines might cancel events but won't be easily closed.The politics cannot intervene with religious facilities based on the Japanese Constition.Are the cathedrals closed in Italy or France?
"Thanks for this nuance Global. I'm confident that will not happen so easily thank god . I hope the first panic is slowly subsiding and things will gradually improve. I noticed that Japan is also slowly ""sinking""in the list of affected countries. That is encouraging. Looking very much forward to our 3rd visit.(last one was 10 years ago) being an admirer of japanese culture."
"I agree that ""we're in uncharted territory here."" FWIW, however, I would guess that temples and shrines would be about the last thing to be closed. Requests for self-isolation are, IMHO, far more likely.I'm not trying to sway you either way; just offering food for thought. It's a complex situation, for sure..."
"@Tokyoaaron,..... well, comforting thought we'll probably be able to spend our holiday more or less as planned, enjoy sakura and hopefully some good weather !"
It's the hot spot. France is detecting the virus more efficiently than Japan now. 423 cases.How about theirs?
"I think they are carrying out the PCR tests much better now after the concerns of the mass number while DP had priority for two weeks, even I feel it isstill just the tip of the iceberg. Because of the cluster some are reporting and been checked but many of them don't have any symptoms yet.The people who denied was rejected by the Hokenjo, local health administration offices, saying the symptoms were not serious enough, but from yesterday, the doctors don't need the Hokenjo's agreement any more.I hope California and the US can solve the Grand Princess situation better than us.Edited: 11:07 am, March 06, 2020 "
Now they are testing 699 cases or so a day. You can check the chart on the Ministry page.Previously we had a large number of evacuees and the DP to be tested.The livehouse cluster is raising the number these days.The trouble with patients that they are so active that many of them even with a fever go to gym and spread it there. The fitness clubs are temporarily closed but some might go out of business.
Does anyone know where to find out what kind of announcement was made? I looked in Japan Times but they only mentioned that the PM was granted emergency powers but nothing about continuing the current prevention measures.
"The bill to grant/extend (depends on who you ask) the power to declare a state of emergency passed as expected today. There's two more votes, but both ar econtrolled by Abe's LDP Party and there is no doubt the bill will pass.Two important things to remember:1. just because the bill passes, it does NOT mean that any or all measures will go into effect immediately2. Of the details I have seen, the provisions may greatly affect those already in Japan; HOWEVER it does not appear to have anything to do with banning/quaranting arrivees, etc. I'ce posted an outline of the new bill's provisions as best I've been able to gather at https://medium.com/tokyo-coronavirus/tokyo-c…"

"There doesn't seem to be an official press conference of the Prime Minister, but the Government asked to continue the temporary closure for ten more days.The news said that Tokyo Disney Resort was supposed to resume on March 16, but if there were Government requests, they would be closed longer."
"Yeah I couldn't find anything concrete on the situation, as far as I'm concerned I'm still going (29/03)."
"As noted above, the government announced today that the emergency bill has passed the first stage, and is expected to pass the next two steps by Saturday.Please see post #23 for details.There was also some information announced about funding for domestic measures to deal with the budget for offsetting costs of fighting the Coronavirus in Japan, but I don't recall the details - and assume it isn;t of much interest to travelers.Edited: 6:11 am, March 10, 2020 "
"... heard something about extending the closure dates, but haven't seen anything on the government or media websites."
"Here’s an article from Kyodo News with comprehensive coverage of yesterday’s developments from the Abe government, including extended closures, the emergency powers bill, and new travel bans on Iran, Italy, and San Marino.Japan PM Abe calls for event cancellations for additional 10 days over virus. https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/03/2…FYI, the new emergency powers bill does not seem to contain anything targeted specifically at travelers. I've detailed the list of new powers at https://medium.com/tokyo-coronavirus/tokyo-c…"
Nothing drastic happened and no one seems to really be reacting to yesterday’s decision. Just another work day today for most people. Most students are still free to slip out of their houses in order to enjoy this sunny weather today whilst trying to dodge their teachers who are also out there attempting to catch them outside of their homes patrolling the city searching for students having fun.
"So, ”the 10 days later” might be the time when the Government approve the drug. Dr. Thomas Frieden who wrote that RCT is not required for infectious disease outbreak, as follows, was the Director of CDC in the U.S.A., so Japanese Experts in Infectious Diseases will also think that way.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29423…The efficacy of Favipirevir(ファビピラビル) in the 1st Clinical Trial in China written in Japanese Wikipedia (only in Japanese) was marvelous: @82% of patients with fever brecame afebrile (compared with @30% in control) in 3 days, and cough disappeared in @93% (@68% in control) in 6 days."
Good day to all.The reason I am posting in this forum is to inform I am suppose to travel to Taiwan and Japan this April.I am only travelling to Taiwan at present.l have postponed my Japan trip to next year because of the prevailing situation there.I thank all the forum members who have answered my questions ....
Yup. I'm flying out tomorrow regardless.
US issued a Level 3 advisory for traveling to Japan. We are officially canceling. My flight was tonight at 8pm. Devastated.
"No, CDC in the U.S.A. included China, Iran, Italy, and South Korea, but did not include Japan, in its Level 3 Travel Heath Notice, as follows. https:/…faqs.htmlJapan is still Alert Level 2 (Practice Enhanced Precautions) by CDC."
"We need to fight this pandemic together, and each of us has to do his/her part. We should cancel or postpone all nonessential travel for now. It's one of the ways to slow the pandemic. The US government is asking all of US citizens to reconsider travel:https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/t…I know that some of you, myself included, would lose some money if you cancel, but you need to set your priorities straight and carry out your civic responsibility."
Terrified that the UK traveller will be added to the list of people denied entry to Japan in coming weeks. I’m due to fly 31st May...
I hope you’re right! Things are expected to get quite a bit worse here.
