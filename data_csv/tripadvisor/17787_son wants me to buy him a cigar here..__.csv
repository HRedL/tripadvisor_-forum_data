"I don't smoke cigars, but he want a fat one...lol ..bought him cohibas once, where can I bye an authinic kinda cigar"
You sound like you're a sandwich sort of a picnic...
"Shermie - unless you know what you're buying, save you money. I'm not saying you can't find a good cigar in Mexico but fakes abound and it's far more likely that you'll end up getting ripped off .... or at the very least, overpaying."

Airport is usually more trustworthy
"I'm going to take a wild guess here that your son asked for a Cuban cigar. If that's the case, forget it. Educate your son instead. Duties and taxes here force authentic Cuban cigars to be nearly prohibitively expensive. At minimum, a very poor value as compared to a fine Dominican or Nicaraguan cigar. Further, Cubans today aren't what they were 10 years ago. Have your son check any Cigar Aficionado magazine for their ratings.But that's the simple part. The more important point is that this region is saturated by fake Cubans. Unless you're an expert, you'll never be able to distinguish the 1% of authentic Cubans here. That's right -I'd guess that 99% are fakes. Now, if the word ""Cuban"" was never referenced, I'd still refrain from buying a cigar here. My local tobacconist stores, sells and provides much better value, and I'm going to guess that yours does too. Buy a different souvenir, like some fine tequila, non-export of course."
"By the way, I am a cigar smoker, and the absolute *worst* cigar I've ever had the misfortune of paying for and tasting was one of those being hand rolled on 5th Ave in Playa. In a word -Nasty. 2pulls and that thing went from mouth to curb.Learned my lesson that year, and have been bringing my own from home ever since.Edited: 6 years ago "
"Agree with Bella, but if in the neighborhood, check out a Punch Gran Puro Santa Rita. Should be under $5 and it sounds exotic;-)."
"thanks all, looks like I wont be buying him one...lol...unless at the airport...he will live. got him some booze instead just in case, super day to all"
Fake cigars are epidemic everywhere. You really need to know either your cigars or your source. I remember seeing interview with a detective in Toronto who specialized in fake cigars. It was totally disgusting when he described what were in the fake Cubans etc.
