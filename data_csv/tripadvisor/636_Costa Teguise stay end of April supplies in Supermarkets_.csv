Can anyone advise on the Supermarkets supplies re Coronavirus fears please.We are due 1st 2 weeks in May at Nazaret Mansions but keep seeing photos posted of empty shelves in Supermarkets in Arrecife? We are still hopeful the Foreign office don’t cancel this part of the Canaries.
"No bottled water yesterday in my local dino, shelves empty.Trying to buy sanitizer but none available. I believe all markets are cancelled and schools and many tourist attractions are also shut"
"We are booked for 23rd April but we have resigned ourselves to not going. If the FCO doesn’t advise against going, we might have a pleasant surprise. If I was a betting man, I wouldn’t bank on it."
Thank you for this ...not good at all.
"I agree I dknt think this situation is going to be resolved in just a few weeks, I know lots people rebooking for June ect but even then I dont think worth getting excited."
We are in Arrecife right now. The big Eurospar in town has lots of availability. There’s a few gaps especially in toiletries aisle but they have a delivery of toilet roll today which is on the shop floor still on the pallet. There is a queuing system to limit the number of people in store at any one time. The hyperdino out by the marina has plenty of availability and is quiet with no queue at all.
No panic buying now and all supermarkets open. They seem to be receiving new supplies with little or no problem -- although local temporary shortages of fresh produce are always a fact of life here.
"Due to go to the Nazaret on 5th May for several weeks, have just booked decorator to do some work, things will not be resolved by then"
Jesus folks need to get in in your heads this will taje months to run its course will be at least 5/6 months before anyone is going anywhere and realistically your talking 2021
I dont think its fully sunk in yet many still expect a few weeks then everything will be ok
"Due first two weeks in May but resigned myself a few weeks ago to write 2020 off as far as holidays are concerned. In my view this will not be resolved this year - but then again I'm not a ""viral"" expert!"
"Have to agree with Robert V that was me a few days ago.Edited: 12:50 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office stateCOVID-19 Exceptional Travel Advisory Notice for Spain, including CanariesAs countries respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel and border restrictions, the FCO advises British nationals against all but essential international travel. Any country or area may restrict travel without notice.You will need to wait until that advice is cancelled before making travel plans.Spain is currently in total lockdown"
"The supermarkets are fine.However we came back from there today, managed to get an earlier flight.The restrictions there are huge.Not allowed out of hotel unless visiting supermarket, pharmacy or bank.Even then only one person is allowed to go.Taxi's restricted to two people.There are police there to enforce this.The current lockdown is until 29th/30th march however looking at current events i think this will be extended."
Actually i would say dont goSorry but we wish we hadnt and its a beautiful place that we have visited before
The supermarkets are extremely well stocked island wide because there's no panic buying like in the UK.The lockdown has been extended to 12th April. It is highly likely to be extended beyond that.All types of hotels are empty and are expected to remain so until June but nobody can guarantee anything. From a permanent Costa Teguise resident.
"We have the military patrolling the centre of Corralejo over on Fuerteventura and everyone has to justify to them why they are on the street. Scary!My food shop last week was quite distressing. But, used to the ""new order"" now, this last week was easier. Mercadona had more empty shelves this week. Loo rolls etc were fine but HORROR! very limited choice of alcoholic drinks!!! Choice overall was limited e.g. cheese, fine, but it was mainly sliced/grated stuff which is far from cheap. For some reason (subsidy?), most fresh fruit and veg was massively reduced even though not close to expiry. Happy to eat lots of fresh, cheap veg! Not so happy to have no fresh milk and little unsalted butter, but hopefully that's temporary.I imagine the OP has decided against coming to nearby Lanzarote. It certainly is not a holiday destination at the moment and I imagine our own May holiday week there won't happen. But I'd personally far rather be here than anywhere else. I'm quite proud of Spain for biting a very unsavoury bullet."
"You can't currently go on holiday to the Canary Islands. They are closed to tourists. Tourism globally is not going to recommence any time soon. We've got a week booked on 7th May which obviously is not going to happen, also 2 weeks end Sept/Oct which I have mentally written off already. I can't see tourism being an option at all this year, and maybe not until well into next year, although I'd desperately love to be wrong.Then they'll be the added problem of which airlines and tour operators are actually still in business. It's going to be a long time before life gets back to the sort of normality we've got so used to."
