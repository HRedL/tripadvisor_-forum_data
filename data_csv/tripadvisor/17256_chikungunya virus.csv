"Hi all, me and my partner are getting married in August and we have always wanted to visit Bora Bora but we are a bit scared with the outbrake of chikungunya. Would any1 have an update on this? is it still active in Bora Bora or how bad is it?"
"Below is the link to an official release by the Presidency of French Polynesia - Council of Ministers and a google translate below it. This release was issued on March 18, 2015.…presidence.pf/index.php/…End of the chikungunya epidemicThe chikungunya epidemic that hit all the islands of French Polynesia since the month of October 2014 is now complete. For three weeks, the number of new cases of observed patients is less than 5 persons per 10 000. This criterion is accepted as the threshold end of epidemic.However, the virus is still present in French Polynesia. The Austral Islands and the Marquesas Islands, if the epidemic approaches its end, people are still affected, but the number is now very low and rapidly decreasing.The Department of Health said that the personal protective measures against mosquitoes and the fight against houses are still needed and should be continued, in particular to avoid the occurrence of new epidemics carried by mosquitoes (eg especially dengue).Everyone must continue to remove deposits every week. The managers of public places, friendly gathering or the public should continue to organize periodically the dégîtage.Thanks to the efforts of all health professionals in the public and private sectors and in public, at all points of French Polynesia, the epidemic was reached without resorting to exceptional measures or external reinforcement.After the initial phase of the disease, many patients experience a persistence or recurrence of painful symptoms. This phenomenon is known and occurs in about half of those affected, and in some cases, medical treatment will be necessary. In case of occurrence of pain with fever again, people should not hesitate to consult their doctor.Health professionals are aware of the post-epidemic phase that will generate a request for support for persistent and chronic forms of chikungunya for several months. A summary of recommendations for good practice in this regard has been circulated to all the professionals involved. Surveys will be conducted with a sample of people to evaluate these chronic forms.During the second quarter, a broad awareness on arbo viruses and their impact will be implemented by means of a traveling exhibition and public debate.sunny regards,shully"
That fantasic news thak you for the replyEdited: 5 years ago 
"I have been trying to get information on this as well. March 18th was a long time ago it would be appreciated if some guests who have recently returned could provide some feedback regarding their experiences. We are debating about dropping some of our inland excursions in Moorea should the chiki still be an ongoing problem. We will be there in two weeks, seems hard to believe :-) ...."
"When you were there, did you hear of many tourists or locals still getting chikv?Thanks!"
We will be there in about 2 weeks and will take precautions. From the various posts that I have read over the years a significant percentage of the population in the region did get the disease which is one way that any epidmeic of this type will eventually end. Obviously most of us travelers have not gotten the disease and the unknown question is whether the mosquitos still harbor the disease.
"Just returned from an almost 3 week trip to bora bora, tikehau and rangiroa (April 30 to may 18) and there was no mention or sign of it. I think it's run it's course."
"Folks,Here are two sites with good information. spc.int/phs/PPHSN/Surveillance/Syndromic.htm…govt.nz/health-information/communicable-dis…"
We just returned from two weeks in Moorea and Bora Bora. No mention of it at all. We did get a few bites (when we forgot to put it on). Make sure you have repellant for the Moorea airport-the mosquitos were really bad there.
Thank you very much for this update. That is good news!
"My wife and I were there last week, for two weeks. My wife got eaten alive by mosquitos, even with repellant, and she still did not come down sick with Chikungaya.I think it has run its course.I will say, we ran into many Tahitians with a self-described ""epidemic flu"" that were very sick. In Moorea it was especially prevalent. We stayed at the Hilton, and it seemed that 75% of the Tahitian employees were sick! Take your Emergen-C qnd Airborne folks!"
"Hello, I've been reading your very informative updates on the the mosquito issues. Thank you for the great info. We will be vacationing in November at the Bora Bora Sofitel Private Island. Do you have any updates on the chikungunya virus problem? Is November a potentially bad mosquito season? Thank you so much for your insight."
On Bora Bora -- so you did have to routinely wear repellant and saw mosquitoes on BB too>
"In Bora-Bora now at Thalasso. I ALWAYS get bitten by whatever flying bugs are in a wet climate or even camping in non-tropical climates and so far, I had maybe one no-see-um bite with almost no itching, no mosquito bites, amazingly see no bugs in all the lush vegetation on this resort nor by lagoon. We have not been using repellent as a result. Will report back after jeep tour in interior on main island of BB later this week, if results different (we will have repellent in backpack just in case for that day)."
We too had absolutely no bites and didnt see or hear a mosquito on Borabora. we stopped using insect repellant after the first day. But we didnt go into the inside inland areas. We did a lot of walking through villages and we were based in the mainland.
"Updating my post from other day further,here in BB now. On the jeep tour, used Deet all over, max strength, but still got bit. The bites may be all from gnats/no-see-ums, not sure. Our guide said people are not getting Chiki anymore. I think the hotels (we are at Thalasso) probably spray or something because got no bites there and see no bugs at all there despite lush foliage and high humidity. Will update again if anything new."
"I'm at Le Moana now, almost nude on the balcony in almost total darkness. The breeze is nice and there's zero mosquitos."
My wife and I went on our honeymoon the last week of 5/27 - 6/2. I didn't get a single bite. My wife looked like a human pin cushion after our evening on the main island. Almost no bugs at the FS. Have fun and spare no expense. This was hands down the best trip of our lives!!!
"Dear Cooljuk,First of all: congratulations! :)Second: we arrived to Bora Bora about 3-4 months ago. We still get bitten, especially my fiancee, but we didn't get chikungunya or dengue or anything like that. Supposedly a while ago practically everyone on the island got chikungunya, but it seems that everything is over now. Also, I did go down with the flu that someone mentioned before, but that was non-mosquito related. That ""flu"" was also as intense as regular flu, but within 2-3 days I was completely fine again as opposed to a regular ""flu"" which usually knocks me out for about a week.Have fun when you get here!"
