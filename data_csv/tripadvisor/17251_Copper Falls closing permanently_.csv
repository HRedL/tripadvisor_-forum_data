Anyone have additional information on this? Kind of weird they'd send such a letter to staff but then tweet that will most likely reopen?https:/…
"Oh, I hope not, it's been one of our favorites since it opened. We always visit at least twice, sometimes three times during our two week visits. We only have a short list of restaurants we like and have lost so many to closure over the years."
From the letter via the link it does sound like Copper Falls is a permanent casualty of the virus situation. We always enjoyed our dinners there.
"If they close for several months which may easily be the case they have to let the staff go. They may certainly hope to reopen. There hundreds of businesses here that are currently going through the same thing. There sadly is nothing surprising about it given the current situation. Many workers here in the service industry are work permit holders, and businesses are required to pay health and pension. If they businesses are not making money or not even open, they can meet their obligations and have to let the workers go."
"In the letter to their employees......”we will not be reopening.” Sad, but this statement makes their intentions quite clear."
I don’t think my company will reopen either but maybe something unexpected will happen.
"Thinking a company will not be reopening vs “we will not be reopening” makes a difference. I know where we live, from people we know who have been slammed, there will be many restaurants, small businesses that will never reopen even with the high level of USA infusion of grants and other $$$. A total shocking reset. Even those of us who have not been significantly affected financially are quite disturbed, saddened, and emotionally drained as we do our best going forward knowing life is going to change for all of us. Somehow enjoying all of the perks, such as vacations, now have no meaning or value given the overall scope of life. And this sentiment will definitely take a toll on everything related to travel and tourism for quite a while to come."
Very sad but not surprising given this horrible epidemic. It was one of our favorite haunts for many years. I hope and pray they can recover someday and reopen.
"Retrip, I wondered about Cayman employment law and if ""closing permanently"" either allows the management to stop paying or providing benefits to workers and/or allow workers to be free to apply for some type of unemployment compensation."
"Years ago my husband worked in the States under a B1 Visa. The visa gave him the right to work there and was held by his employer. If he quit or was terminated he was required to leave. I have no idea if B1 is still around but that is pretty much what work permits are here. The employee is granted the right to stay and work on a permit granted on behalf of the employer. Does not carry over. I don’t know what is in place for Caymanians but there is no option for those who no longer have a work permit but to leave. This is a very short answer to a complicated Immigration law. There are many different “levels” (not an official term), but most foreign workers fall into the aforementioned category. For instance the spouse of a citizen has different rules. When I moved to the UK, I had different rules than UK citizens. I think it is pretty normal for those who choose to work outside their home country to have different regulations than citizens, but please don’t quote me on any of this. Just my take."
There isn't any unemployment compensation here in Cayman. We dont have any income taxes so there are only a few assistance programs for the most needy. The govt has just announced a low interest loan program this week though for small businesses that may need it to get through this time.
