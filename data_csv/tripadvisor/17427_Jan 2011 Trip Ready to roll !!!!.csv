"Sort of an ""Amazing Race"" trip for us this time. Flights to Cozumel were $$$$ so decided to fly into Cancun, stay one night in Playa Del Carmen then take the ferry over the next day for a weeks stay at the Presidente. We have never taken the ferry before.... should be fun. ANyone else staing at the same hotel Jan 12-19 let us know (: Also... if anyone has any transportation tips getting to Playa from Cancun International would be appreciated. Jeff"
tinyurl.com/7m3r6Or check the prices of private services such as:usa-transfers.comIt is a simple cost-benefit/convenience decision on your part.Only buy one way ferry tickets.
"I will be going Jan 17-24th !! We got a GREAT deal!! $700 per person, direct flight from Minnesota, All Inclusive to El Coz! So geeked about this trip! Cheapest I've ever seen in the last 6 years!!"
"pegster 1975 - Wow, that is a great price! Who did you book through? We fly out of MSP also."
abcte- We used orbitz and the promo code 200entertain The price has gone up a bit since we booked but still an amazing deal to be had! Good luck!!
PS. if you travel Monday to Monday the prices are WAY better!
"Thats Awsome !!!!!!!!! We got a deal like that last year..... I called it our swine flu special (: island was empty...... some hotels even closed until the ""epidemic"" was over. Have a great time !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Hola,We are flying into Cancun and then going to Isla for 3 days before going to Cozumel to stay at the Presidente. Our dates are 12/28-1/9 so we will just miss you!We decided, at 69pp to fly from Cancun to Cozumel. It is a vacation after all and we didn't want to lug everything from bus to ferry etc.We also were able to get a flight out of Cozumel so we don't go back to Cancun. Renting a car, also, at Cozumel airport so makes transport easier all round!Buen viaje, Kim"
