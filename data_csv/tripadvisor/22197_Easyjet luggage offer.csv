If you are planning a visit to Mallorca later on this year Easyjet have a new offer - 0.99p for hold luggage up to 23kgs.
Sorry but my gut feel on something like this is a company is trying to 'incentivise' bookings for cashflow. Also need to check if the ticket price went up to cover this 'offer'?Your choice but I'd keep well away from it for the moment
"Are you still kind of 'trapped' in your apartment in Mallorca, Luckjon ?If so, what's it like being there ? Looking at webcams it all looks sad and ultra-quiet with nobody being allowed to walk along the prom or beach."
"Still here and just about to enter fifth week of lockdown. The word I keep using to describe the situation is surreal - the absolute quiet : no cycles : little or no traffic. You also suddenly realise that you have not seen any children for 4 weeks. But, the supermarkets are well stocked with effective systems of social distancing. The local community is very supportive and the nightly applause gets everyone out on the the balconies. It is frustrating being in touching distance of the sea and beach but we do feel safe here.Your favourite spot on Albacuix beach is still littered with yachts washed up during storm Gloria, but it is still beautiful ... just surreal seeing it 'sans' people."
It doesn't work for me and not only because we travel without hold luggage. I can understand it's vital for them to keep hold of the money. You can book on EZ up to the end of March 21 so I've done that more as a gesture of hope than anything else. We have many trips between now and end of October and I doubt we will go on any of them. It really pales into insignificance next to other concerns. I wouldn't want to travel before there is either a vaccine or a reliable antibody test. You can't go out for a walk without a dog in France - is it the same there?
"<< You can't go out for a walk without a dog in France - is it the same there? >> it certainly looks like no walks (or cycling) allowed.I check the (semi-live) webcam linked below from time to time - and the prom is always absolutely deserted.Under normal circumstances, and with it being school hols and Easter, the prom & beach & that beach bar & the bar tables near L of the camera would be busy.https:/…port-de-pollensaAnd the same in Puerto Soller. https:/…port-de-sollerAll very sad - and certainly surreal.Edited: 4:11 am, April 12, 2020 "
It really is KWUK.
"Hi Clemjake, where can you avail of the offer to rebook at no extra cost?"
Just tried to charge me £900 to change flights by a month and half.
"On the Easyjet website. Not worth phoning the customer service number at the moment.Edited: 4:16 pm, April 12, 2020 "
https:/…change-for-free
Thanks littlelamb. Is only when your flight is cancelled? As I said there is an implied suggestion on clemjakes post that they won't charge the extra to book on to another dearer flight. As I said for us four it's an extra £900 for the same flights in August.
"The latest info on their coronavirus hub is that they are formally cancelling on a seven day rolling basis. You will be offered an alternative to rebook, get a voucher or a refund. For changes, they are waiving the fees until further notice. If the flights you want to change to are more expensive, you'll pay the difference. I couldn't see where they were waiving the price difference but maybe that has changed since they added this info. https://www.easyjet.com/en/policy/coronavirus"
""" I couldn't see where they were waiving the price difference"" I imagine ( 'cause I've no read anything ) that they might stop collecting any previous flight change administration fees only? Certain Ticket types/prices are kept 'low' by only allowing changes with an additional fee?Edited: 4:26 am, April 13, 2020 "
"Hi stedoc Ni, it says on the easyjet covid 19 hub on the easyjet app ,if your flight has been cancelled you won't be charged a change fee or fare diference you can transfer onto any flight free of charge up to march 2021. You can transfer to most popular destinations during peak periods free of charge.Change to any flight any time for free , that's what is says.Hope this helps , sorry don't know how to send link to the forum .Edited: 4:36 am, April 13, 2020 "
"Just read that one and confirm it does say that about ""no charge for price difference"" until March '21. https:/…q5Stedoc - it might depend on where you are due to travel. Go to that link and it should tell you.Edited: 4:42 am, April 13, 2020 "
"Hi thanks littlelamb and Clemjake only when cancelled that is different, only problem is booking accommodation and I note it's says Malaga in September not August so maybe not before September and schools are hopefully back. Ah well hope it benefits some."
It does say anytime for free
+transfer onto flights to our most popular destinations during peak periods free of charge
@Clemjake you don't have to wait for your existing flights to be cancelled to rebook - there's a totally online process that will allow you to transfer flights for free at any time. You will of course have to pay any price difference if the flights are more expensive (which some are saying they are).
But once they cancel CL you don't have to pay the difference.
"Took advantage of the 99p offer to book flights to Seville next March - we always take luggage on holiday. However still have flights for 25th April to Madrid and - after reading Clemjake's adventures, will wait for the cancellation then switch to any flight free - hopefully for the first time in 8 years in August - as summer is a time I have to be in work in the normal course of events. Luggage already paid on that one."
Got my eye on £800 worth of Malaga August flights for my £100 Madrid April ones :-)
@johnincornwall895 switch for free means you don't pay the usual admin fees (which can rack up quickly). it doesn't mean you can swap from a £100 flight to a £800 flight and not expect to pay the difference :)
#23 Says he successfully changed to dearer flights with no extra charge ?
Some cabin fever thinking going on by some ;-)
"My bad, misunderstood that once they’d been cancelled that you could just rebook regardless of price. My mistake :)"
Chunky that is why I asked the question earlier in the thread seemed to good to be true. By 7 days before my end of June flights there will be nothing left in August if people with £100 flights can snap up dear August ones.
"Pointless move in my opinion, bracuse of the confined space of a plane the amount you touch and breathe in because of air con."
"I assure you chunkylover you can switch to ANY EJ flight without paying the difference once yours has been cancelled. Ours happened today and although we could have switched to £800 summer flights as I said, because of the Mrs's caution we have picked up the same Madrid flights (same country villa!) at the end of September. The cost was a basic £300 against the basic £100 we paid for next week. You do not have to pay the difference.2 points - you must wait for your flight to be cancelled and also I'm not sure Ryanair apply the same generosity."
"John - you can see Chunky's acknowledgement way back in #31. I'm of the same opinion as your missus. It doesn't really surprise me that you could get the same villa in late September as people are (rightly in my opinion) being cautious. Even if it doesn't work out - and I hope it does - you will have lost very little and are helping EZ to keep the cash flow going.The aisle seats (our favourite) are maybe half a metre apart and then you have the cabin staff next to you and everyone who comes/goes to the loo.Edited: 9:27 am, April 17, 2020 "
"Yes if it isn't safe to travel at the end of September we won't. Even if we do lose out eventually it was around £100 for the original flights when paid last year.Villa is cash on arrival, like a lot of inland Spanish owners - and yes, fully licensed and checked!"
"Was wondering if legally you rebook your flights due to covid19 cancellation, as you the booker where fully aware of the facts around cancellations. Can they then not have to refund you should the next flight be cancelled.Edited: 2:15 pm, April 20, 2020 "
Stedoc When you first booked your flights we were all fully aware of cancellation policy and airlines have relaxed majority of the penalties and encouraging you to re-book. As nobody knows when travel can start again I am sure they will keep extending the offer including re-booking when the government state when travel can resume.
"Hopefully right calviadon but wouldn't be like them to try and say that. I wasn't aware last September about covid19 but I am now, is how they may word it?"
"Have people been keeping an eye on TCs when choosing new dates? How much have terms texts changed? @OP It would be surprising if lawyers / CFOs had not given it a lot of thought re new outbreaks....possibly flight forums might yield more insights?Edited: 2:09 am, April 21, 2020 "
Easyjet T and Cs were last updated 24th July 2019. So exactly the same T and Cs for our switched flights.
"I reckon airlines will continue waiving the previous penalty charges accordingly until travel resumes. I personally have accepted vouchers / refund and would not plan any flights until it is all over and safe to travel again be it later this year or next. Also having to accept things will be different and starting again like what airlines , tour companies will survive and at an affordable cost. Proper holiday insurance with health cover will be priority but higher premiums and excess might then make foreign travel too expensive for many.As each week has passed we are realising how serious it has become and having to look further ahead. Okay when the lockdown is relaxed I could easily visit Cala Bona ,Alcudia and all the beautiful resorts on the island as often as we want but will miss the freedom of visiting friends and family in Uk and France when we want to so we are all in the same boat. Said my bit and stay safe as Mallorca will still be here."
I am sure that the island is very different at the moment to you as a resident CalviaDon. The lockdown in the Balearics is clearly being adhered to better than in the UK so I hope that things will be eased slowly so that you all can have a bit of normality but I fear that tourism in the islands will be a lot different for a long time to come once the current crisis ends.Stay safe everybody
As days go by it seems likely no ones going this year. Of those that have had ezy flight cancelled can you confirm are you allowed to book any where free of extra charges or is it just original destination. For example I had booked Majorca but now will change to tenerife?
"StedocWe were due to fly Saturday 25th. 8 days before (last Friday) our flight was officially cancelled and at that point - not before - we were able to switch to any flight anywhere up until the end of March 2021 (might be April now. Having only paid around 100 quid basic originally we could have booked anywhere - August, Xmas etc.The wife was more pessimistic than more and so we didn't book the £800 Malaga August ones and just rebokked the same route (Madrid) and the same villa (switched) - these dates would have cost us about £200 moreA few days before that we booked 99p luggage flights for Seville next March. £110 for 2 return flights, hold luggage and seats. Credit card just in case. Too good an offer to missEdited: 3:26 am, April 23, 2020 "
They are also offering vouchers for cancelled flights - to be used at any time for a booking made in the next 12 months. You don't have to fly in that time - just make the booking - to any destination at any time. So you could use it for Summer '21 when the booking schedule opens. You get the details when your flight is cancelled.
Yes I guess the voucher offer is more attractive the more you have paid for the original flights. In our case (low price) it was a win win situation to take the switch
I agree. We could have opted for a refund but we would like them to be around next year. The husband feels they should be offering a little extra on the voucher value to encourage more to choose that option.
I'm told you are not protected if they go under if you take a voucher.
"I believe you are covered under the Consumer Credit Act if original purchase was by credit card. We have annual travel insurance which covers airline failure but I haven't checked to see if this still applies. They are very clear on their website that you can have a refund if you want it but I fear if everyone does that, coupled with fewer bookings, they could go under. I might opt for a refund on the remaining flights from June-September but will see how things look then. I don't either expect or particularly want to travel before there is an effective vaccine."
"I note on another thread, someone has been told that rebooked flights are not eligible for a refund, should they be cancelled."
