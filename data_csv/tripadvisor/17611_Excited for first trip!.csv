"Hello, all,Been reading the posts here to prepare for our first trip to TCI next month. It'll be my first international trip, and I booked with Delta Vacations, staying at Seven Stars Resort. I booked this trip for hubby and myself way back when, and it didn't become ""real"" until I got my dinner reservation confirmed from Coco Bistro today. Wow! We're really going! Grace Bay Beach-here we come! :)"
"Watch out for the illness currently effecting most travelers to Provo: Provoitis. The only known cure is a return trip as soon as possible. I have a pretty bad case, I'm sitting at the gate waiting my turn to board. Have a great time, report back with your findings if you can."
"Have a good one. Say hi to Lila, Don and employee of the year (for real) Beatrice in breakfast. Wow her by pronouncing her name correctly Bee-ahtriceAnd you too Rebecca. I thought the cure to provotitis was heavy drinking"
"Heavy drinking you say? Let me give that a try. It is the least I can do in the name of scientific medical research. I WAS finally allowed to check in, but only at the airport. Gabriel had no idea why and asked where is my final destination. I tell him, saying Providenciales the correct way (without the CH as most flight attendants say) and he had no idea where it was. Bad sign. I mentioned Turks and Caicos? Ah! Got it! Gabe (we're friends now) had never heard of anyone saying the island name that way...usually just providence Rhode Island like. No problem, here you go as he puts a luggage tag on my bag headed to PLP. WHAT! My new friend wasn't my friend at all. I explained that I am not going wherever this said (Panama) but Providence! The one in the Turks and Caicos! I have no carry on so losing this bag would be tragic and mean a big shopping trip upon arrival. Bag tag fixed, no harm done, I'm on my way. JetBlue is getting 5/5 stars so far (except for Gabe who gets just 4), just 2 hours into my flight."
"On the last flight over, my oldest overheard some Beaches bound folks question ""why do they keep saying Providenciales?!? I though we are going to Turks and Caicos. Enjoy Panama"
How do you say it? I need it chunked into syllables! :-P
"This is not just TCI forum conjecture. Our first trip was March of 2016. 3 days in, we re-booked for March of 2017. But in between....a 5 day quickie in November. I would have never guessed we would do this. My wife and I had never repeated a vacation destination before. You have been warned."
Mocha2 Its pronounced prov e den che r lees (CHEese) and the other one that's tricky is Conch pronounced Konk. We have contracted Provitis and bringing some friends in March to expose them to it. Its an epidemic!Putmo!
Thanks!!
"Wow, thanks all! I'm extra enthusiastic now (as if I wasn't already before). :)Rebecca: yes, I have read about ""Provoitis"", and I already told my husband. We are considering which limbs or organs we want to give up in order to afford the inevitable next trip. ;) But seriously, I'm looking forward to experiencing Seven Stars, and Grace Bay Beach. All I want to do is lie on the gorgeous beach with a good book and a good drink, and get away from corporate life for a while. Djb: that's quite the countdown @ 134 days! :) The anticipation is worth it, right?Ziggy: good heads up on the names! Thanks-will definitely keep ""Bee-atrice"" in mind.96Hawk: oh yes, I believe you. That happend with me and Hawaii (went in November 2015 and got hooked; booked another trip right away). That's why my husband is scared of going to TCI...he knows I will probably fall in love and want to return right away. Thus the ""limbs or organs""...Still reading this forum for valuable tips, and will definitely write up a trip report once the time comes."
"Continuing with the anticipated excitement & countdown for/with y'alls: just confirmed spa treatments for me & hubby, and the Sunday Beach BBQ dinner at Seven Stars Resort. Woo hoo!Next up to do: booking snorkel excursion with Caicos Dream Tours (or other companies?)."
"Chandra, you are going to have such a great time!! It sounds like we both like to vacation the same way: on a gorgeous beach with a book and drink in hand. Last week, I went through 3 books in a 4 night vacation in Provo!"
