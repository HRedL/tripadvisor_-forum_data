"I want to just create a list of places doing the tests - If you want to ask other questions please ask them elsewhere - This vital info is getting lost in the confusion.If you know of anywhere doing PCR tests, please give links here.These have been mentioned elsewhere already:-.This is one home-test kit. They guarantee a pdf by email within 24 hrs of receipt of the sample https:/…covid-swab.https:/… SARS-CoV-2 Swab PCR Testing is available via our laboratory with results the next evening."
"I have the websites/emails of 5 private clinics in Holland doing the PCR travel test... prices range from 100-150 euros, turnaround time 24 hrs, the ""covid-free"" paperwork/certificate is included in the price. I won't clutter up the forum with the websites as it might cause confusion (and I don't see any Dutch people posting here anyway). If any Belgians or Dutch wants these addresses, leave me a message and I'll post them."
"Hello, very good idea eLaRef. There are THREE crucial questions apart from time and place: -- what type of PCR TEST do Egyptian authorities demand ?-- what type of PCR CERTIFICATE do they demand? Do they accept certificates from any lab ? (For ex. Hawaiian authorities demand certificates from officially certified labs which means we don't have time to get one in LA and had to cancel our November trip.)-- how recent (3 days, 1 week?) must the certificates be?WE WILL SURVIVE!Cheers.F.W."
"@FrederickWentworthSee ""Egyptair specifies what proof is needed for PCR test"" thread here:https:/…107733053or directly at Egypt Air here:https:/…202020.aspx"
‘ on arrival to Egypt all passengers will be required to provide a negative PCR test (COVID-19 test) and a locator form. The test must be obtained 48hrs before travel and can be in the form of a text or email. Children under the age of 6 are exempt. Failure to follow this could result in refused travel or denied entry to ur destination. Nothing about a certificate - confused.com
