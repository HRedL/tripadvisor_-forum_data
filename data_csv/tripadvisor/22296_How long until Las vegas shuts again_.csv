"So I read in the news today that cases are continuing to increase across the us . Nevada is highlighted as one of the states having increased transmission and that was before vegas started to reopen?I have watched some recent videos on youtube of vegas reopening and was shocked at the lack of social distancing, is it only a matter of time before vegas will be shut again? What is everyone's thoughts????This is from the bbc news page.US Passes Two Million cases states report rise The 20 states where confirmed cases are increasingAlthough the daily number of new cases has declined sharply in some parts of the the US, including in New York, the figure is increasing in 20 states.New York Times data shows the seven-day rolling average of new cases is up across the past two weeks in:California; Texas; Florida; North Carolina; Arizona; Tennessee; Washington; South Carolina; Missouri; Utah; Kentucky; Arkansas; Nevada; New Mexico; Oregon; Idaho; Vermont; Hawaii; Alaska; and Montana.The NYT says the increases are ""in part because some [states] have recently ramped up their testing capacity"".Edited: 10:49 pm, June 11, 2020 "
Not anytime soon.
"I really hope not , maybe good treatments and/or a vaccine might help"
"Appreciate your concern, watching things appears a low volume of participants, however the lack of mask use is unacceptable,"
"Personally speaking, I don't believe that they will shut Vegas down again during this pandemic, and I don't want that to happen either.However, that being said, I do personally believe that the data/evidence has already made clear enough that the lack of masking in some parts of the U.S., including Vegas, is an error of judgement that will cause more infections and deaths than would otherwise occur. i.e. during this second wave that is just commencing. Ultimately people make their own choices in life, and some people (or those they unknowingly infect) will obviously (tragically) suffer an increased risk of a negative consequence.I don't believe that the second wave will be worse than the first. However, these things (e.g. lack of masking leading to increased case numbers) can only serve to prolong the economic, social and medical difficulties that some Americans currently face, and will also continue to negatively affect tourism revenue from international tourists hailing from countries where the virus has been more effectively managed by governments, and individuals. For example, I very much doubt that large numbers of international tourists from countries such as Denmark, Greece, South Korea, NZ, or Australia, etc. will rush to Vegas anytime soon, or that any of these countries which do have travel bans, will rush to reopen their travel borders with the U.S. Even though, I certainly look forward to getting back to Vegas, once case numbers settle down further, which obviously will occur at a certain future point as time progresses.Just my opinion, and everyone has one...and is entitled to one...Edited: 7:16 am, June 11, 2020 "
Watch the web cams looks shut down now ?
"COVID-19 infection rate in Nevada is now 5.4%. The decision to open up the casinos was made when the infection rate was 6.2%. The infection rate has been in decline since then, and is not showing signs of increasing.Las Vegas has the advantage that the COVID-19 problem arrives with the tourists, and then leaves. If the COVID-19 situation looks to be worsening, mask wearing will be mandatory, and together with social distancing, it will be sufficient to suppress it."
"Of course the number of cases is increasing, because the amount of testing is increasing as well. The results need to be presented as percentages and not raw numbers."
"@Rallen2018,source for your figures?Here's one for me:from: Las Vegas Review Journal on June 9:Source: https:/… ""Number of new COVID-19 cases surges in Nevada, Clark CountyThe numbers of new COVID-19 cases in Clark County and the state spiked Tuesday to their highest levels in 2½ weeks.The county recorded 207 new cases of the disease caused by the new coronavirus over the preceding day, the Southern Nevada Health District reported on its coronavirus web page, the highest figure since it reported 233 cases on May 22.""Agreed with Rhinoman though that increased testing rates may account for part of this increase.But I also think that the reopening will also increase case numbers in the coming days.And I fail to see (re: your comment Rallen2018) how tourists bring Covid-19 to Vegas is a plus for Vegas, since they can obviously accidentally infect other locals or tourists during their stay.Edited: 8:03 am, June 11, 2020 "
At present I can’t imagine a situation where Vegas shuts down again.It is slightly distressing to see folks who seem to feel invulnerable. The virus may be with us for a long time.Another complete shutdown would be catastrophic economically for Vegas as well as the western world as a whole IMO. At present there seems to be a balance struck between what has become acceptable Covid “losses” through infection and death directly versus equivalent losses due to financial hardship. It’s hard for us to admit but humanity is really in control if very little on this planet including viruses.
"We long ago identified the vulnerable populations. If we take strong measures to safe guard those persons then the rest should go about their lives as normal, if you get it at that point it will essentially be a nuisance and you come out on the other end no longer a threat to anyone.These social distancing policies are prolonging the period that we have to deal with this and continue to be a burden on our economy much more than just throwing open the doors and letting life resume as before."
“ COVID-19 infection rate in Nevada is now 5.4%. The decision to open up the casinos was made when the infection rate was 6.2%.”What does that mean? 5.4% of the population has Covid? What is an “ infection rate”?
"Responses 9 and 10 are right on imo. A 100% vaccine is improbable,so get used to this virus being around unless it dies its own death."

"I believe the ""infection rate"" that is referenced is the percentage of people tested that are positive for the virus."
"The only way things are going backward is Vegas, or anywhere in this country, is if we have a surge so bad that hospitals get overrun. What you're seeing IS the ""new normal"". Basically enter society at your own risk."
"It's not going to happen. Public safety is no longer the primary factor being used to make decisions. Any thinking person knows that no matter how some try to skew the numbers, the infection rate is now going to go up. It's supposed to. So far not a single thing that has happened has been surprising. Everything has gone as one would expect. Including which areas and groups would have the most trouble complying with programs and creatingopposition. Reclosing a sector as large as travel and the casinos, would be unexpected. Once everything is finally open there won't be any going back. We will just have to ride it out. Thankfully many areas will be better prepared for what is happening next."
It won’t shut down again. People are over it. Covid be damned!
"Hawaii is an island that has some of the strictest regulations right now re C-19. You basically can't be a tourist there now. NYC has near universal mask usage and some of the strictest regulations on the mainland. It is still spreading in these places. Clearly masks don't work to prevent the transmission of the virus, despite all the Karens trying to make them a thing. The stupidest thing I've seen people told re them is to only have your mask down when you are drinking. Yeah touch it over and over, thats hygienic. Totally won't spread what amounts to concentrated virus and germs. Viral load is what matters. One single virion or even a handful of them is not going to get you sick. You need a specific viral load. Me talking to you from 3 feet away isn't going to do that. Me touching a concentrated mass of the virus on a mask, then touching everything around me is a problem. Vegas won't be shut down again, masks will start disappearing. More places are making them recommended than mandatory. The looters helped with that. As for infection rates, they should go up. All that matters is a low number of deaths and thus far unless you live around NYC or in a nursing home, your chances of living are 99.96-99.99+%."
I think there will be another shutdown sometime this summer.
"I got a screenshot of that DTC.I hope your wrong, but given the weakness of leadership may be the easier (though not right) thing to do."
I do not believe there will be another shut down. Having 500-2000 people die per day from covid19 is now acceptable. The alternative is an economy in tatters. So let the living live and the dying die.
"This is an interesting question, and only time will tell. I agree with what others have said. As long as locals and staff in the major resorts stay healthy, Vegas might be okay. If all the people visiting mingle primarily without physical distancing or PPE, I can't imagine how that won't have huge impact in those folks home cities. Unless some sort of contact tracing happens, not sure that will track back to Vegas. If airlines have further restrictions due to a significant increase in cases, that too will have a huge impact. If the US relaxes it's borders, the problem likely compounds. My home town in BC has fared pretty well, as has most of Canada with the exception of Ontario and Quebec. Stay safe and respectful everyone!!"
"If tourist get sick it will not be a problem or probably not even noticed as being related to Las Vegas.If large numbers of employees get the virus, they will shut it down. Same as with the pig and beef slaughterhouses. Try to buy a steak or pork chops today at your grocery store."
"“ Try to buy a steak or pork chops today at your grocery store.”I’m not sure about today, but things were in plentiful supply here when I shopped on Tuesday. Last month was a different story, but it looks ok now."
"Bob, I will be happy to be wrong."
I was at Vons yesterday and there were pork chops and steaks.
Go vegan.
"I’d be surprised if Las Vegas shut down again. The financial devastation is just too severe. I could see making masks mandatory when in public, but I also doubt this will happen."
"I bought plenty of meat last weekend. Can even find ""Prime"" graded beef. Funny how a meat shortage was the media's ""thing"" until the protests. Then it and COIVD went away for a bit. Now with the protests being mostly peaceful again, well outside Seattle's 6 square block ""Capitol Free Zone"" or whatever Antifa is calling it. There won't be another shut down. If anything things being open frankly opens people's eyes. You get over your fears by confronting them. The agoraphobia people have right now will subside once they go out to dinner and don't catch anything. Once they get back to their routine. Economic uncertainty is what will kill the US economy, and nothing feeds that like the idea that businesses might need to open and close multiple times on the whim of some politicians."
"I am older (late 60's) and love to travel and visit bars and restaurants. I have recently retired to enjoy those pleasures. Quarantined in my home and prohibited from travel is not my idea of retirement. I am in excellent health and would rather take my chances. I plan to keep my trip to Las Vegas this fall. Hopefully, if I get sick, it will be after I get home, and I will recover in a week or two."
"The Covid Infection rate metric was used specifically by Governor Sisolak to determine reopening. He stated that percentage would determine reopening, he knew that with increased testing we would have more raw cases. In the Las Vegas area you can get a test if you want one with no appointment required.I am amazed people keep looking at raw numbers and don’t understand. It is almost as simple as adding the room rate to the resort fee to calculate final price.Edited: 11:42 am, June 11, 2020 "
"I think people are missing the real economic danger: Whether there is a *voluntary* shutdown. I agree with others that it's unlikely we'll see another full-scale work from home scenario, but rational people will make rational choices out of self-preservation.It's important to note that a lot of the social isolation occurred prior to the official lockdown orders: https:/…A segment of the population won't care and will treat the disease as a nullity, and increasingly people will get comfortable taking the risk. But the economic blow to Vegas will be dire if even 20% of would-be travelers decide that it's a risk they won't take for themselves and others. Notwithstanding the economic damage already done that will limit travel budgets for the near future.I don't begrudge opposing opinions at all, but we are nowhere close to being out of the woods with this thing."
"For those asking about infection rate, it has been discussed previously on the topic linked below:https:/…106624719The infection rate is the second chart down on the LV Review Journal, link below:https:/…"
"Wasn't really intended to be a discussion of beef and pigs, but to point out that when large numbers of workers are in an environment that lots of them get sick, it will have an impact on the operation. If the employees sense that they are not adequately protected, they will stop coming to work."
"“A segment of the population won't care and will treat the disease as a nullity, and increasingly people will get comfortable taking the risk. But the economic blow to Vegas will be dire if even 20% of would-be travelers decide that it's a risk they won't take for themselves and others. Notwithstanding the economic damage already done that will limit travel budgets for the near future.”I agree with TriedManyTimes. We go to Vegas 2-3 times a year, and I think we are in the 20% of travellers that won’t be going until the fall/winter 2021. It will be a wait and see situation.Cheers!"
"We were getting close to making the decision to visit but with the latest increase in cases (regardless of cause) we've backed off of that for the time being. I think they will shut down again if this resurgence continues.As far as meat is concerned, I guess it depends where you live. While there's no issue with getting red meat in general here in the Portland area, there is a definite lack of selection."
"I think the real danger is, as TriedManyTimes pointed out, people simply electing to not visit. This threat is compounded by the sheer tidal waves of stupid Americans who are convinced that cv-19 is a global conspiracy to ensure trump is not re-elected. I hate to bring politics here but these people are definitely making the odds longer than they should be for Vegas to survive and start to thrive again."
"The government is not trying to do another stimulus package. They're reporting on how many jobs have been made and how the economy is going forward. I dont think they want to shut anything down ever again. At this point, all of the precautions being take are to assuage all of the scared ppl who thought the world was going to end because the government renamed the flu and the media ran with it like the unintegral idiots they are. But if it bothers you that much, feel free to continue to cower in your own house like many ppl still prefer to do."
"Its been really interesting reading all your comments. I really hope vegas can find its feet as I love vegas and really want to come back out. Coming from Scotland I can't come 3 or 4 times a year but like to try and get at least once a year.I hope in a few months time vegas will settle down and find what works for the public and the staff, only time will tell."
"""Having 500-2000 people die per day from covid19 is now acceptable.""If that many people are dying every day then our leaders are doing a terrible job of protecting those that have been identified repeatedly as being vulnerable. Has nothing to do with social distancing and other pseudo protections it has to do with protecting that part of the population that is in danger. If 500-2000 people equally distributed among all age groups start dying every day then we have a different issue."
"News say California has “spike” in new Covid cases, attributed to “Reopening”,But we are not open. Everything same as last week, last month, and 3/17 when everything shut down. No retail store, no mall, no restaurant, no school, no party, no crowd. Can’t be protest, too soon. Logic is wrong or based on wrong information."
"I have been cowering, not at home, but on the golf courses and tennis courts, Tina. I won't be going to lackluster New Vegas right now. This afternoon I will cower around my swimming pool.Edited: 1:30 pm, June 11, 2020 "
It will not shut down again nor will any other place in this country
"BobS. yep.. Protecting the vulnerable population is very important. Testing is finally catching up and all that goes with it, contact tracing still needs work. Even though the younger folks do not die they are still getting very sick and will have long term effects from Covid 19, such as scarring of the lungs. And you are absolutely correct, if a different section of the population, such as children, were dying by the thousands the whole conversation would be different."
"""It will not shut down again nor will any other place in this country""Probably not. That said, the caviler attitudes and attempts at shaming (""cowering"") those who mean to take the threat seriously could be enough to cause the shutdowns all on their own - no government intervention required. If things get out of hand a la northern italy then people will simply stop going. Full stop."
"wait, you mean if there are more tests given, more people will show positive for covid 19?wow, that's some amazing reporting there. and the crazies on here and all over social media will make it all about them and talk about how they were always right and 2nd wave and masks all the time everywhere and look at me look at me look at me."
"If the first total shut down doesn’t work, why would you do it again? You try something else."
"We WILL get another quarantine if a vaccine is not available for the second wave. We all locked down fairly quickly, so why WOULDN'T they call for another quarantine?"
"""wait, you mean if there are more tests given, more people will show positive for covid 19?""Is this true? In my state we are still only testing people with symptoms AFAIK, Perhaps the spike of hospitalizations in Arizona is also due to increased testing?"
No shut down because people are pissed. Apparently taking over a police station and six square blocks in a major city is now apparently socially acceptable.
As a note of caution. The second wave of the Spanish Flu was more deadlier than the first wave.https:/…spanish-flu-second-wave-resurgence
The second wave also occured after a major war in an era with far less advanced medicine.
"Amazing how people take precautions like masks, cleanliness and distancing as an assault on their rights. Where is the compassion for the 60yo blackjack dealer who has to work? I live in Vegas. My neighbor works at the Flamingo. Her and her coworkers are disgusted by the attitude of most visitors. If you care about others with minor inconveniences you are labeled a coward??All you non-maskers are hurting the economy long term. Arrogance is not a badge of honor."
"""The second wave also occured after a major war in an era with far less advanced medicine.""Indeed. It is unfortunate, however, that our medical resources are not (yet) infinite. It's also worthy to note that even with our advanced medicine we have lost over 115k American citizens in less than 4 months. We can downplay the risk at our own peril."
"I wonder how many died from the ""regular"" flu this year ?"
"Well said Desert Nomad. Of course, those that most need to heed your message will just tighten their blinkers even more. This is a time for everyone to pull together for the greater good, but not everyone gets it.And medicine may not have been as advanced during the second wave of the Spanish Flu, but of course there wasn't anywhere near the level of global travel then that there is in the modern era."
"“ I wonder how many died from the ""regular"" flu this year ?”I’m surprised you couldn’t just Google that.“ CDC estimated that there were at least 24,000 deaths related to the flu during the 2019-2020 season.”https:/…flu-update"
“ I’m surprised you couldn’t just Google that.”You are?
"A Harvard doctor stated that there could be 200,000 deaths by September. Where are the coronavirus briefings? There hasn't been any since April."
"@DTCFauci and Birx couldn't be fired for political reasons, but for all intensive purposes are neutered. They are allowed to speak once and a while but I'd be shocked if we ever saw them do another major presser. As far as I can tell, Pence runs the COVID show."
"We are going this weekend. We are bringing masks to wear. However, we are drinkers so I'm trying to figure out how we can do all this safely"
“ but for all intensive purposes ”My “ nails on a chalkboard “ moment for today lol.
"....oh well, ""for all intents and purposes"" sounds like that."
Your right. Its probably a mute point.
It's a doggy dog world.
It just doesn't pass mustard for me.
Oh well...I could care less.
"I suggest everyone watch over the next couple of weeks. Between the reopening (and few masks and VERY little social distancing we see on local TV) and the protests, I feel many states, and Las Vegas, is going to see a surge, a large surge. As Globalroamer said, just my opinion."
"""I wonder how many died from the ""regular"" flu this year ?""Better question: How many people die of regular flu in April, May, June?"
Should of blamed it on auto correct.
Oh I think forum member Otto Correct does a good job of pointing out errors.
"Ideally we would be doing 2 million tests a day with a rigorous contact tracing system in place. That way when the virus inevitably spreads we could quickly isolate and prevent an outbreak from happening. Then if lock downs are needed it would be regional at worst rather than a whole state. Plus two weeks ought to do it.Of course we have nowhere near the testing and virtually no contact tracing. We won't know of outbreaks until well after they are happening, It may be happening now. Increases in FLA, NC, SC, TX, AZ to name a few are far outpacing increases in testing. Does that mean lock downs will return? The political will isn't there, things will have to get REAL bad. I think the true barometer will be hospital capacity. If ICU beds get filled they'll almost have to lock down. Right now a few states are getting nervous, Arizona in particular. Time will tell.Here in the US we've politicized this to the point where all bets are off as to how we respond. But I'm pretty confident in saying foreign travelers anxious to visit are screwed. I don't see any way those countries will allow travel here (at least absent a quarantine) for quite a while. If I had to bet I'd say 2021."
"""Here in the US we've politicized this to the point where all bets are off as to how we respond.""I'm sad to say this is absolutely true. I have my suspicions as to why this is the case but will bite my tongue. Suffice it to say the average American IQ is apparently plummeting."
Enjoy....https://youtu.be/8Gv0H-vPoDc

"HardTen,Not a different segment of the population, a broader segment of the population.As it stands there is a well defined segment that can be segregated until it's deemed safe. Concentrating on protecting that segment should be priority one.Segregating the rest of the population is pointless and counter productive."
"2,000,000 tests a day will be very hard to scale up to. The labs that test for it, there are two huge companies right now that are the main ones with only a small handful of labs capable of doing it would need to find other space to house this testing. As medical treatments begin for other things, routine, not just life threatening tests are being run again so it isn't like there is extra space just laying around, nor qualified employees. You then have to purchase the equipment for it, hire or move around employees to do the work, and train them. This is a process that takes months."
"""I wonder how many died from the ""regular"" flu this year""One of Man's greatest gift is his ability to rationalize. After all there probably wouldn't be any wars without this ability.

"""This is a process that takes months.""No kidding. That's why 3 months ago we should have made it a national priority. There is zero question if we had we'd have gotten there. Instead states have had to go it alone, very often being forced to compete with each other. Private labs have been reluctant to make the investment to scale up, not knowing if the market would be waiting for them. If ever a situation called for decisive leadership, this was it. We didn't get it and now we've opened up woefully unprepared.Edited: 6:29 pm, June 11, 2020 "
"""You can tweak the numbers any way you want. Don't worry, there will be plenty with their own agenda who will make sure to find and explain those numbers for you.""An objective person (if any exist) can only posit so many ad hoc explanations before they come to the conclusion that either a) there is a GLOBAL conspiracy to overstate the danger of cv-19 or b) the virus is a real threat."
"KT is right in that it is good to be open about who you are, and be tolerant of others. I have friends who are very liberal and some who are very conservative. Being able to look past labels and just enjoy time with a person is what we should all strive for. My favorite bar was like that. Most of the regulars knew my thoughts on things, I knew theirs. Aside from a short period on Sundays politics was rarely spoken of. Black, white, brown, even rival gangs would come in, sit down, be peaceful and leave. Never gotten so many hugs from people that at least on the surface were very different than me. I personally wouldn't want to live in a world where everyone thought like me. Yes it would be ""perfect"" but not really. Imperfections, diversity add to life. I'd be just as happy to share a drink with someone from here who is liberal, conservative, libertarian, whatever as long as the conversation was good and hopefully the alcohol too."
Private labs were trying to survive. Not to be disrespectful but you have no idea how tough it was for them since March. It's something they are still working on recovering from. If one of those companies went belly up it would have been a nightmare. Unfortunately hindsight can't help us. Not to go back and forth on this but in early March almost no one was saying this was going to be a major event. That goes for both sides. R or D mistakes were made.
"KT,New respect for you expressing your views.I have never been affiliated with a political party as I refuse to be beholden to someone else's philosophy.Upon reflection I would credit/blame my parents and grandparents for my world view. One of my grandfathers was a post civil war Democrat from a border state, and although I admired him as much as any person in my life, his particular politics would not be go over well in our modern world.We are all products of our past and if we can try to understand where people are coming from maybe we can get above this hyper-partisan environment."
"Here's some good news for all the manly men who won't let a virus scare them from doing anything they want, regardless of its potential effects on others.. If a tourist comes to Vegas and gets the virus and even winds up in the hospital, it isn't counted as only Nevada residents statistics are figured in the disease rates. . So you don't need to worry about finding out that putting lots of people together during a pandemic is a lousy idea, and can continue to believe that its all a hoax. If we could only get the flu deaths up, we could then completely ignore covid. if we can be Number 1 in the world in Covid deaths, we can become Number 1 in the world in flu deaths if we just try.But why not do what number 31 advocates, go to Vegas and bet your life. More exciting than money for sure. I would love to be able to go to Vegas--I guess I'm just not manly enough."

"""I wonder how many died from the ""regular"" flu this year""""PB: If this was not your quote, or if I possibly misunderstood it, I sincerely apologize.I've seen it used many times, sometimes even with statistics. As far as I can see the only reason it is ever used is to try and minimalize the effect of the Covid Virus. It must not be that bad because more people die from the flu every year. Possibly an equally insensitive comment I read is ""Most of the people who died were older and high risk."" So these people aren't as important?

They are the countries now that have mostly conquered this disease, and in some cases completely eliminated it from within their border.Secondly, of course hindsight can help us. It can help us now with the reopening, so that it is done properly and doesn't lead to the creation of a big second wave and more death and the economic and social destruction that results form that death. Even though it could easily still be argued (and many have) that the first wave is not even finished.The vast majority of the people on this forum who have argued for basic and common-sense scientifically proven measures (including during the reopening) like wearing masks and following social distancing are not ""crazies"" or 'cowardly' (as some others have described them). Rather they are people who are advocating the proper management of the crisis (or now the reopening) that American case numbers still to this day tragically indicate has been so badly handled, and continues to be so badly handled.But hey, I'm just another ""crazy"" who cares more about saving the lives of others, than where and when I can get access to my next Vegas luxury suite or expensive restaurant or cocktail.

And add ""exponential growth"" again too.I truly thought with the hot weather we wouldn't see a spike for a while. But looking at the positive percentages in states like Arizona, Texas, and Florida to name a few, it looks like it won't take that long. These states have been among the earliest to re-open. Very troubling to see.In other news, the CDC stated the highest risk is in large gatherings where many are from out of the area, also known as ""super spreader"" events. Sound familiar?"
Love contact tracing. Just not forced tests and forced quarantine. My health is my business. And I'll do what's right. That doesn't mean locking myself down for two weeks just because I was in a Starbucks with someone who turned up sick.

"I don't foresee states going back to a full lock down unless/until things get truly bad. The political will isn't there. As it stands a few states are trending in the wrong direction, but they are nowhere near a full outbreak. What I do foresee are mandatory quarantines in some states for out of state travel. I do see states stepping back a phase or two.(This would impact things like casinos.) If you'd asked me a week ago I would have predicted it'd start happening in September. But I think it's becoming more and more likely it could possibly be much sooner."
“ What I do foresee are mandatory quarantines in some states for out of state travel.”How do you envision that process? Camps with armed guards? Locked hospital wards? Roadblocks?

">>Possibly an equally insensitive comment I read is ""Most of the people who died were older and high risk."" So these people aren't as important?<<For one thing, there are some people out there who are/were irrationally terrified of COVID, sure that death was imminent for themselves and their children. There is nothing wrong with pointing out to these people that, although COVID is something to be mindful of, they (and their children) aren't actually facing a sure death because, statistically, they just aren't in a high risk category.Secondly, determining who is most at-risk helps us make sure that those individuals have the care that they need, all while attempting to keep the rest of the country (and world) going.When there are a few pregnant women working in the factory, you don't tell every employee to stop lifting heavy items, nor do you stop serving deli meat sandwiches in the cafeteria. You change the at-risk peoples' jobs up a little bit so that it's safe for them, and you expect them to take some of their own precautions, too, like avoiding the deli meat or seeing their doctor if something seems to be wrong.

"@ Mac,re: ""I don’t understand why people who like Las Vegas wish the city and casinos ill, it’s like hoping they fail..."".Did you ever consider that the people advocating the following of basic common-sense, medically proven and accepted practices like wearing masks and social distancing, are doing so for the exact opposite reasons? i.e. because they want Vegas to succeed by getting back to normal as soon as possible, and without further unnecessary transmission of infection and the loss of life that goes along with that.Re: ""Why do patriotic Americans wish their country to fail? hoping American economy will collapse, doing their best to make sure tens of millions of Americans to be unemployed, wanting 100 million Americans to go hungry, waiting in food lines, lose their homes, predicting fellow Americans to die.""Did you ever consider that it is perhaps the people who selfishly put their own interests above those of others, and put others at risk by refusing to follow basic common-sense and medically proven and accepted practices like wearing masks and social distancing, who are actually the less patriotic, because they are more likely to catch the virus and thus infect and pass it on to others, some of who will die. Isn't that the less patriotic and more damaging act to the U.S. in the longer term? Wearing a mask (for example, in an enclosed indoor space like a casino) doesn't cause ""tens of millions of Americans to be unemployed, wanting 100 million Americans to go hungry, waiting in food lines, lose their homes"", etc.... Nor does standing a bit further away from someone until the virus situation has settled down. e.g. via social distancing. However, not doing so, and making the virus transmission numbers worse through someone's own selfishness just because wearing a mask feels geeky or inconvenient can if fact ultimately cause some of those things to a degree, if the situation got out of control again. And remembering that the data (source: Johns Hopkins) tells us that virus transmission numbers are increasing in almost half of the U.S. state, rather than decreasing.Re: ""I can understand foreigners saying bad things and wishing the worst for America, Australians, British or Canadians...?""Why, because they're 'foreign'? That is such an incredibly insulting statement to those countries who lost their own citizens fighting alongside the U.S. in some of the wars that the U.S. started or became involved in like the Korean War, VIetnam War, Iraq Wars, Afghanistan war, etc... that I'm just speechless...

It is people like you who seem hell bent on destroying Vegas. Sadly there are some Americans that don't understand that your economy will continue to tank so long as you decide to allow a virus to run rampant. Those of you who downplay the virus and are willing to sacrifice the elderly and otherwise vulnerable in the hope of financial reward are the ones that will destroy it. Here in Australia we're recovering, going back to work etc cause we had a responsible government who got it under control, rather than an outta control moron forcing us to go back to work while the virus was still running wild."

"Mac's comment is not only insulting, it's downright fascist. Millions of people doing their best to protect their loved ones are un-American? Experts who are trying to create a recovery that is sustainable and not based on wishful thinking want the US and Vegas to fail? Whatever.2saltydawgs is right to be disturbed in that there are half a dozen and likely more states that are not just suppressing the data but are obstructing efforts to deal with the problem. Georgia in particular. I'd sooner trust China's officials than anything they release. Not only are they barely doing any testing, but who they do test is not targeting where the virus likely is. The scary thing is that if and when it reaches the point where we reach the point where exponential growth happens there it'll be too late to do anything about it. They have zero tools in place to deal with it. I guess Mac thinks of them as ""real"" Americans."
"""Phoesam. What is your plan to keep it from revisiting on an airplane? Test everyone in your country daily?""Hey Steve M, ever hear of contact tracing? Lots of countries are doing it and it works! The goal isn't to prevent any infections, that's just impossible. But with ample testing and contact tracing you can identify it quickly, isolate those at risk and prevent a few cases from turning into a full outbreak. And even if that fails, instead of locking down an entire state for months you can pinpoint a much smaller area and lock it down for a few weeks. You don't even need a full lock down even. You just need to artificially lower the R naught to break the chain of transmission. Ever hear of an R naught?"

Shocking to hear that some states are apparently masking the truth about this.
What's ironic here in NYC we HAD the highest amount of cases but now the transmission rate is one of the lowest in the country. Why you may ask? Because virtually no one goes anywhere without a mask. Almost EVERY place of business has a sign on the front door stating no mask do not enter. Wonder if mask wearing has anything to do with us lowering our cases? ICU's are back to normal well almost. It was rough for the past few months but most of us can see light at the end of the tunnel now. Just wear a friging mask. Don't put your FREEDOM above others around you. But then again I guess selfish people do selfish things. ME before anyone.

The unwilling? My governor who is Following the science without understanding it. Is requiring 2 percent positive tests. How will that happen? I'm don't know anyone feeling healthy who says.

Swear---I agree. There's NO WAY a shut down will happen again. You would be talking about total anarchy in the streets
"If you think that you'll be able to control the actions of others reliably, you'll be consistently disappointed. People still text and drive, speed, drive drunk. How many times do we see people do something that is absolutely contrary to their benefit or the public's benefit and not care, despite their being laws regarding it? Add in the completely ridiculous level of animosity that exists right now due to many things, and people not believing in what they are being sold by the government which flip flops like the best politician and it's just a futile effort. People need to take responsibility for their own safety and not expect others to do the same. If that means you go shopping for groceries at 5 AM, you stay inside for six more months, do it. I've seen people wearing masks do the dumbest things. Not just touch them and touch and just cleaned surface, but one lady was wearing it outdoors in 90 degree heat for probably 15 minutes waiting to be seated at a restaurant, suddenly pulled her mask down, sneezed, then raised it again. THIS is the level of intelligence we are working with as a society. Were all people actually capable of using PPE correctly, yes masks might cut down transmission rates by a fair amount. However, we aren't perfect. We aren't in a medical setting wearing them for a short period of time. If someone like Fauci, standing right behind the President, can't keep his hands off his mask, what chance do we?And there won't be another shut down. In Orange County they practically rioted over mandatory mask laws. The Health Director resigned. Order was repealed on Thursday of this week.

"""Whom are they to test? ""In Georgia's case? Atlanta and the surrounding areas. At a rate 10X the current pace. In the entire country's case? Randomized testing at workplaces, when you fly, when schools open, etc. To contain this virus we need first to find it. But sadly it's too late for that. We re-opened without adequate testing and it's now everywhere. All we can do is wait and see what happens. I agree that using the positive test % as a metric has it's problems. Until a large enough portion of the population is tested regularly, say 2 million a day, it can't paint a complete picture, too many holes and biases. Without a data base collecting it all for real time analysis, any potential actions taken is likely too late.You know what would REALLY help? Let's say 2000 drive up testing sites across the country. Maybe at Targets and Walmarts. Maybe the federal government guaranteeing say 50 millions tests a month through 2020 so that labs are able to scale up capacity safely knowing the market exists. Maybe a national data base run by say Google giving governments real time data? I wish someone had this idea 3 months ago. We'd be in much better shape now."

I wonder if there will be another lockdown because the first one was relatively easy to do. It's not like we'll have a say anyway.
So forced testing? Two million a day?

"There isn't any evolution on the subject, I just tried to be as clear as possible."
And it isn't cost free for my governor to make the mistake of percent positive tests being a requirement to move to phase three. Business will just stay shuttered while the idiot figured it out and changes the number arbitrarily when he finally realizes it. He's already done it on case per 10000 from less than 10! To less than 25 (both arbitrary). Opps thousands more business never coming back while inslee was struggling to understand the science. Oops my bad.
"It is logistically impossible to do 2 million tests right now. With the big two, counting antibody and active virus tests we are around 500,000 I think."
Ideological disregard for safety precautions will be self-defeating and there isn't going to be any way to hide it.

Inslee has done an excellent job. Most governors have.

How a weakened population will eagerly believe outright lies rather than a truth that is even slightly discomforting to them. How ""doublespeak,"" the practice of using language alone to declare a lie a fact is eagerly accepted by a scared weak populace.Seriously Steve, read it again."
"The right blames the left the left blames the right. The reality is trump whether we want to talk about “it” or not is the the detriment to our country. It’s also quite interesting when the right state claims that the left ( who are primarily blue color working class ) want to do everything in our power to up seat the oligarch at the cost of society when most of our programs are to benefit just that. Even tester the anniversary of Pulse Orlando shooting , pride month and during a racial movement he went the extra mile to now take away the civil liberties from trans gender people. And you wonder why we do desperately want “it” out"
"""Big government keeps the population under control through fear fanned by the media. The left will let the working class rot on the vine all in hopes to change power in an election year...Do it or admit it doesn't fit your politically slanted requirements?""Politically slanted? You state that the ""left"" lets, or wants, people die to get rid of the president. I don't suppose you have any satistics that back up that nonsense? And you began with some weird mashup of big government and the evil media working together. Doesn't seem to make a lot of sense since the stable genius has been in control of the government for almost four years. And you're saying he's working with the media to fan the flames? Do you even understand what you're trying to say?Edited: 4:12 pm, June 13, 2020 "
Angelina you talking the Obamacare section 1557? It was struck down by the courts in 2019 and never enacted so it was just eliminated by HHS. The media fails to mention that in their latest reporting of it.
"""Tell us the hospitalization rate by age and the death rate by age.""Here you go: https:/…mm6915e3.htm2.5% 18-497.4% 50-6517% 65+Death rate is pretty low if you are younger AS LONG AS MEDICAL CAPACITY CAN KEEP UP. I capped it because ultimately that is what will determine future measures taken. So far only NYC and NOLA reached capacity. As a result the death rate surged. Thankfully we locked down before more areas were overrun. But now? Things are getting scary in some states. And we are no much more prepared for it now than in March.You know what Steve? Asymptomatic carriers may drive the percentages down even more. So what? How does that change that hospital capacity may be under threat? How does that change that 114,000 have died with no end in sight? Oh right, it only matters that you aren't at risk. Got it. Guess what? Me neither! I'm not worried at all about myself if I get it. But maybe, just maybe you might consider the 70 million who are at risk."
"I'm hoping that readers learn something from these arguments. No one expects covid-caused deaths to be preventable, but LESS infection means LESS number of deaths. Whether you accept that distancing and masks help curve infection or not, there is no disputing that roughly 2% of the infected will die in the most horrendous way imaginable. Anything anybody does to tamp down infection (mask, distancing) is admirable and should be appreciated, not denigrated nor shamed. Oddly enough, the ones who throw side-eyes and insults are the ones who are least informed AND live in locations likely to be hotbed of infection resurgence. Because, you know, the guy on top proudly celebrates ignorance, self-importance and the illusion of invulnerability. The virus does not care whether you believe its' potency or not. If you get it, it will impose its effects on you, and those close to you, with unpredictable severity. People wearing masks around you are trying to minimize that risk both for themselves and for you."
Flipboy is right in that ultimately the results will ultimately speak for themselves in who is right or wrong in how they regard Covid. This is what it's come to. Which is an absolutely insane and tragic way to deal with a virus.
@true. But it was part of his plan. I’m reading the 2019 case and it was his administration that pushed for it. Please don’t try to fluff it
Exactly. Thanks flipboy
The only decent post in this thread was jamrob’s post about his female Dr touching him.
"I’m not fluffing anything, you’re just on here trying to show all this outrage over something that was never allowed to be implemented."
The solution is clear. In_Seeno_Man inspired me. Forget the trips to Vegas. All are invited to Seattle to participate in a 6 block summer of Love. Come one come all. All that is needed are masks and a great sense of civic pride. Seattle will lead the way out of racism and covid 19. And I sadly have to report there is a guy walking around that 6 block area with a bag on his head so In_Seeno has competition.
@true It was allowed and signed into law through Obama care. I’m sorry that trans rights offends you
"@Hardten, I do have relative in Seattle,,,,, hmmm.Have you been to the 6 blocks of fun?"
"They don’t offend me. I could care less, but to say this is all Trump is very very misleading on your part."
"HardTenWould love to see that six square block free zone and spend some time there before bunker boy emerges from his fortress to singlehandedly bring law and order to the area But alas, I am 70 and afraid to fly in the middle of this pandemic."
In_Seeno. Have not been. My daughter and friends went yesterday for a couple hours in spite of rain. They say it was peaceful and a happening place. They plan on going back again as it is not ending any time soon. There is a saying in Seattle that the Fremont area is the Center of the Universe. I believe Capital Hill has now taken that mantra.
If you're going to free Seattle be sure and wear flowers in your hair.
"Interesting to hear that. The thought of it going on in our Country, especially with graffiti on the police station boggles my mind. Perhaps the 20 plus years in the military has me given me the mindset of rules and discipline only. I am glad to hear your first hand account that your daughter is safe in the area. Thanks for the update."
"Mac, America is not Ethiopia, there is no food shortage. If you had all been patient and complied with lockdown and observed other guidelines rather than out occupying government buildings armed cause you want haircuts and forcing people to work in covid infested environments, you might be in the same place we're in in Australia. I don't understand why people like you would rather see tens of thousands of people die, than wait til it's safe to get a haircut. And I can't imagine how insecure a person must be to refuse to wear a mask. It's all so sad and doesn't bode well for those of us from other countries who would like to go back and visit Vegas and other parts of America again sometime soon. You think Vegas will survive on just local tourists?"
"A note re Steve's posts.....I've pointed this out on other threads too. He appears to have recently joined and never posted about travel, only about re-opening. 50% of re-open USA accounts on twitter are bots. I'm sure it's not just twitter with paid bots. https:/…Edited: 6:43 pm, June 13, 2020 "

"Yeah, you do."
"Many of the anti-shutdown protesters were armed to the teeth with assault rifles. Yet I don't recall anyone demanding they all be arrested nor that it would be justified to use tear gas or beat them. Also I must have missed the part where we were calling on the President to use our Armed Forces against them.Now if you ask me, bringing an AK47 into the State House to protest ought to be illegal, but that's another matter.And if you really want to go there, some of us see a difference between systemic racial bias that result in a man's murder versus the desire to get a haircut or see a movie.Edited: 9:45 pm, June 13, 2020 "

">>Now if you ask me, bringing an AK47 into the State House to protest ought to be illegal, but that's another matter.<<If you really want to go there, I think a LOT of things that have been happening with the most recent protests are or ""ought to be"" illegal.>>And if you really want to go there, some of us see a difference between systemic racial bias that result in a man's murder versus the desire to get a haircut or see a movie.<<Claiming the anti-shutdown protests were about haircuts is an intentional oversimplification.I believe we all have a constitutional right to protest. It shouldn't matter if others agree or not. Hence why Westboro Baptist Church has been able to continue their nonsense for so many years. However, my own governor said anti-shutdown protests weren't allowed because of COVID, but he joined in with the George Floyd protests.During the anti-shutdown protests, there were tons of people saying that those protesters shouldn't get medical care if they get sick, that they are grandma killers, etc. etc. People called them domestic terrorists and murderers.Tens of thousands of people can attend memorial services for George Floyd, but there are still people in this country who can't attend a family member's funeral because of COVID restrictions. Yet, any spikes in coronavirus cases are now being blamed on re-opening pressure from the right, not on protests...of course!Either it's murderous to get out and protest or to gather with large groups of people during COVID, or it's not. Pick a lane, because the hypocrisy from one particular ""side"" is getting ridiculous. Kinda like how we should #BelieveAllWomen, until...well, you know..."
"""Yet, any spikes in coronavirus cases are now being blamed on re-opening pressure from the right, not on protests...of course!""It will take several more weeks to determine if last week's protests cause a surge in cases. They might. But without question the current surges, if they continue in places like Texas, Florida, Arizona, Alabama, Arkansas, SC, and now even in Tennessee and Mississippi, are directly tied to the relaxation of restrictions without a new model in place. These are the states that ignored even the minimal guidelines and opened early. ""Claiming the anti-shutdown protests were about haircuts is an intentional oversimplification.""You're right. It's more that many Americans lack even a minimal sense of civic duty and when asked to sacrifice they reacted in a rage like a spoiled child. When confronted by a challenge they retreated into a world of magical thinking where science and facts don't matter. When asked to do the bare minimum, like wear a mask, they acted like if was an affront to their civil liberties. They have disgraced our nation. Or to keep it simple, getting a haircut is more important than saving lives."
"Or maybe many of them were small business owners, terrified of losing everything that they've ever worked for."
"In this republic, everyone's free to pick their sides...share personal opinions...sing their own tunes. It's a damned shame that in today's world that a lot of us have become prisoners to the omnipresent 24 / 7 news cycle via hundreds of sources ( which was accentuated by the shutdown, naturally) just to be 'armed' for the next argument / position stance with the varying forms of what we might individually perceive as ""our"" opposition. eg "" I wonder what the opposing idiots did last night?"" Admittedly I've had such thoughts myself, haven't you? There's no way around it..most of the things we currently see and hear are abhorrently politicized. Each side feels there's too much at stake..and it's really easy to vocalize those things in a mostly anonymous forum. I get it..many of us remain anxious / fearful / jumping through our own collective a$$es because of the conditions ( lockdown and associated strangling effects on the economy, mortalities from several sources, open up, shut it down again, Covid respikes, looted cities on fire, etc). We need an outlet even if just for our own selfish argument's sake but the entire process appears to have transcended free speech, one of our oldest and perhaps most cherished liberties (I know..corny, perhaps). OTOH, maybe it just epitomizes free speech...who knows? I'm not sure how one even accurately defines free speech these days, especially if one considers the overall media as some sort of model.I 'd speculate that Vegas won't close down again unless Covid hospitalization rates and death rates in Nevada significantly and rapidly increase ( to what degree/s , I don't know. Who does?). I realize any evolving Nevada Covid stats might not have much to do with the Vegas visitor population returning to Timbuktu and beyond and the potential spread/ transmission from that group. Common sense and a little bit of concern for the other guy still apply for any current travel approach..to Vegas or elsewhere. There's still just too much uncertainty, particularly with this still largely unknown pathogen, to be overly arrogant and/ or deny the concerns/ plights of others and those they might come into contact with. Roll your own dice..but think about the other guys. I'm tuning out TV news of any fashion for a few days on purpose. We're going to see grandkids in Arizona and will make our first casino visit since this all began. I'll wear the mask / distance /follow the particular rules, etc ( even though I won't like it or want to)..it'll be good ( we assume) to get out for the first time; assuming the joint isn't on fire."
"Like me? I've been out of business for 3 months and have no idea what the future holds. It's scary as hell. But you want to know what else is scary? A virus that can kill millions if left unchecked. We have to deal with it.Reasonable discussions could've been had on how to do just that. Assistance was granted, more might've been needed. Experts outlined ways to safely re-open. Testing and contact tracing. Many countries are successfully doing so. As they re-open they are optimistic they will remain so without the virus still spreading. Even with protests. Our re-opening on the other hand is beginning to look like a disaster, leaving us a choice of either closing down again or enduring several thousand deaths a day.But that was to much to ask of too many. They were too weak. Instead they pretended everything was fine and we just quit trying. Dozens of states re-opened with no plan in place. We're just beginning to see the results. The richest most powerful country in the world, and we've simply quit trying. Disgraceful."
"I'm sorry to hear about the impacts on your business. It seems like you can at least understand where anti-shutdown business owners are coming from, then, even if you don't agree with them.Your posts seem incredibly sorrowful, full of doom and gloom. Can I ask your opinion about the George Floyd protests? Do you think they are okay?"

"lin-duh, I don't see many anti-shutdown business owners around at all. I also run a small business, and this has had a significant impact on my income.....but it is what it is. The overwhelming majority wanted governments to be more careful in terms of re-opening, but Trump's little brain thought that if he forced people to re-open, people wouldn't notice the deaths and would think he was some sort of economic genius and re-elect him. So bizarre. Here in Australia there has been nothing partisan about it.....both sides have agreed with how it has been handled. People who lost 30% or more of their income over last year's income, are receiving $750/week.

"""Or maybe many of them were small business owners, terrified of losing everything that they've ever worked for.""Well sure, but there's scores of scenarios that are outside of the control of business owners that could cause them to lose everything they worked for. Cv-19 is an act of God event. It's tragic, sad, and maddening. But to do nothing will likely be worse than lifting restrictions in a smart manner. Should the spread become exponential and hospitals over run you will see MUCH worse economic devastation."

"@Globalroamer but I'm not sure I share your optimism. You have to question the health of a society who would elect a man long on bluster and short (an understatement) on intellect as their leader. Trump lacks the ability to reason, or even speak in a coherent manner. And make no mistake, this is no recent revelation. It was very clear the kind of child trump was back when he was ""debating"" the likes of Cruz, Rubio, and Kaisich. And we elected him anyway. We are not a healthy collective at the moment."

Trump of course did not force anyone to do it--he just dropped the match in the gasoline."
"So, is it murderous for thousands of people to gather right now, or not?"
"Well, I wouldn't say murderous but regardless of whether you empathise with some, all or none of the causes, it's certainly reckless for mass gatherings to take place at the moment if they're being done in such a way that risks further spread of the virus.Edited: 3:23 pm, June 14, 2020 "
“ if they're being done in such a way that risks further spread of the virus.”If? Could you point out which protests you watched that took all covid precautions into account?
None took all Covid precautions into account (USA and UK) as far as I'm aware. I'm aware some protetstors wore masks but certainly not all.
"Sadly, I saw the same thing.I will add that age and possibly race play a big part in this. I fully understand a young person, especially a young black person going out to protest. It would be very personal to him or her and likely more significant than covid 19."
I agree. When people have that level of passion and belief about something ithey will act accordingly.It's just that the timing could not have been worse unfortunately.

"Expect another one in the fall, and probably another one in the spring. We'll be begging for the injections by then."
Arizona made it 34 days before they started shutting things down again. So let's set the O/U at July 14 for when the 1st Vegas casino shuts down.
Upstate you may be right but a little soon. Definitely by late October.
"“ Arizona made it 34 days before they started shutting things down again.“True. But worth noting “ they” in this case are one company closing 3 casinos after an employee passed away from Covid. Unless I’ve missed something, the authorities in Arizona haven’t closed anything yet. Or is “ reclosed “ the right word lol."
Have they established that the unfortunate person contracted the virus while working at the casino?
"I don’t think there’s any verifiable way of confirming that for anyone, anywhere. It’s just assumptions and guesswork. Like the 16 women that went out together to a bar in Florida and were all diagnosed a few days later. I’d say it’s a pretty good guess they all were infected at the bar. But it’s still a guess."
"Fair enough, unless one or more of them brought it to the bar themselves.So the casino shutdown was due to what?"
If there is an upside to the Florida case they are all very likely to fully recover and in two weeks they won't be infecting anyone else.
“ So the casino shutdown was due to what?”Common sense.Business sense.Liability sense. You own a business. One of your employees dies from Covid. You don’t stay open and risk alienating your other employees and customers. Or God forbid more of your employees dying. You don’t let social media and other sources tell your story and start rumors flying.You don’t wait for the government to take some kind of action against your business.You get ahead of the story. You shut down. You announce that you’re doing a deep clean. You get your story out front.
"Bob S... The thing about Covid19, Sars2, is that most young people recover completely, but some have lung damage for the rest of their lives. Having healthy lungs comes in pretty handy later on in life.Edited: 4:35 pm, June 20, 2020 "
"Do you think the employee or any of the employees were working there against their will?Do you think a government can take action against a individual company based on ""assumptions and guesswork"". (I know that's a silly question these days).Do you think that by getting there first that they get to control the social media narrative?How does liability attach when it can't be established that this employee caught it (or spread it) at work (per you).So they clean it for a couple days and all is well or they acted like a responsible company or is it the over-reaction that we can come to expect for the next month, year, decade."
I've heard that about lungs.
""" is it the over-reaction that we can come to expect""... NO.266Over reaction is absolutely right. 120,000 dead is nothing. If we just try, we can get to 1 million deaths and be so far ahead of any other country that they'll never be able to catch us. Only scaredy cats are afraid of losing their lungs. Only bad people don't want the USA to be Number 1. Sad."
Thanks for the drama and hyperbole. I think I will stick with my statement.
"""Have they established that the unfortunate person contracted the virus while working at the casino?""His name was Robert Washington. He was a 68 year old security guard.""Do you think the employee or any of the employees were working there against their will?""He was a 68 year old man working security. Do you think he was there out of love for the job? Greed? He had people in his life who needed taking care of. So he did what he had to do.“The day after reopening, he was like, ‘Lina, it was awful, it was horrible. The line was around the corner. ... Eighty percent of the people weren’t wearing masks,’” his daughter Lina Washington said."""
Sounds like evidence to me. Case closed.
I'm with desert nomad post 54. I'd rather suffer a little by wearing a mask instead of sending someone else to a grave because I felt a little uncomfortable about a face covering. I'm not selfish and self centered.I think vegas will close again
"I don't know anyone who died of the flu. I know 4 people who have died of COVID. Keep dismissing it though, that's insanely ignorant."
"“ Do you think a government can take action against a individual company based on ""assumptions and guesswork"". (I know that's a silly question these days).Do you think that by getting there first that they get to control the social media narrative?“Yes, to an extent. Because the social media narrative of “ oh my God someone DIED at that casino and they’re still open!!’ Isn’t a good narrative.“How does liability attach when it can't be established that this employee caught it (or spread it) at work (per you).“It doesn’t. In theory. But it won’t stop lawyers from trying. “ You KNEW there were Covid cases. One of your employees DIED from Covid! But you stayed open. And my client caught Covid and was hospitalized! “"
"Not sure our economy can afford another closure..wear a mask, practice social distancing,and pray the clowns who refuse to do so don’t create a second wave...so sad the windbag in White House doesn’t wear one..His flock then follow suit...so sad"
But it was there right to be in Vegas....
"I do hope the Arizona casino security guard death wasn't too much of an inconvenience to the fine, principled non-mask wearers there?"
"My best guess is that at least one casino, and probably more, will close again before the end of July. I wish you guys had waited til it was under control before you started re-opening.....so many unnecessary deaths and it's going to be forever before our government lets us visit America again.Edited: 6:58 am, June 21, 2020 "
"It will be a while. It may not need to close down. I believe as folks remember the virus is still active, they will start wearing masks. Plus, I think the Nevada Gaming Board has revised and mandated wearing of masks in casinos."
"Not gonna say I'm certain casinos will close again but I would bet money on yes. I thought we'd plateau a while and then deal with it in autumn. Turns out the weather isn't as much of a factor as we'd hoped. (I do have a theory that weather might limit the severity for those infected but I'll admit that's pure speculation. Viral load is hugely important but we're still figuring out the variance it causes.)I think it will start with one casino closing, where a large outbreak occurs in staff. They aren't testing nearly enough to prevent that. But I don't see them being able to limit it to a case by case basis for long. Masks will help, but I think too much virus is out there for it to be a cure all, at best it will slow it down.Of one thing I'm certain, there is zero chance our friends from Canada, UK, Australia are able to visit this summer. None. I'd bet against all of 2020 really."
I’ll say no shut down again
"We could have prevented this death by staying closed. He and 40 million out of a job. We could have reopened and he could have stayed home. He out of a job. No one, no political party, no business caused this death. A virus did. A virus did.The virus caused this death.Should he have stayed home? Does he need 40 million empathetic sufferers?Should we close again. CNN has reported 50 million food insecure people in the world are at risk of starvation due to the suppression of the world economy. They are big boy questions and there are real trade offs in the results."
"Steve, not getting the virus under control is what has caused all the deaths. We only have 102 dead here in Australia from it. America has over 120 000. The difference is not China, it is Trump. If he'd managed it properly, businesses could safely be re-opening now like we are doing here. Instead he's doing maximum damage to the American economy which has no hope of improving until the virus is under control there."
"Phoensam. 1. It's clear you won't be voting for Trump. ------------------------. 2. You don't understand the independent streak many Americans have. We are not as compliant as other nations. We have shaken off rulers and they have no place in our culture. 3. You vote for shut it down as long as it takes and let 50 million of the world's most poor starve. Noted, thanks."
Steve M but isn’t that what trump is trying to do ? Rule ! From his fat thumbs
"""You don't understand the independent streak many Americans have. We are not as compliant as other nations. We have shaken off rulers and they have no place in our culture""Oh good lord, you still believe that? The vast majority of Americans who don't wear masks didn't choose not to based on their own research. They refuse because their dear leader told them not to. Because their party branded fighting a virus to be cowardly and un-American. Millions followed in lockstep because they are doing as they were told. The pathetic thing isn't that you're a sheep, but that you actually think you're a wolf."
When Australia doesn't have a queen I will answer your questions.
"Priscilla was the bus, Steve."
It's hard to imagine anything short of tragedy with all the steves running around. Fact is you can't elect a trump without a huge population of idiots. We reap what we sow.
"I've been looking at World-O-meter daily. For the past week it looks like Nevada has averaged 2-300 cases a day, and 1-4 daily deaths. That sure doen't sound like enough to shut things down again as of now.Edited: 1:30 pm, June 22, 2020 "
It won’t. When did TripAdvisor turn into Twitter? The mask crusaders need to stay home...let the rest of us do what we please!!!
"Steve, and so many others are clearly paid trolls. Have a good look at all the newly opened accounts that have never posted about travel, only posted pro re-opening posts. I wish tripadvisor would clean this up. Tripadvisor should not be plastered with paid propaganda encouraging people to kill themselves and harm others."
"""Steve, and so many others are clearly paid trolls."" No. 292I only wish this were the case. Then we could just pay them more to say facts. Unfortunately, a portion of the population believes whatever dear leader tells them, regardless of how illogical and counter factual it is. When Steve said, ""We have shaken off rulers and they have no place in our culture."" (no.284) about the only President who argued that he is above the law and can do whatever he wants, he lost whatever credibility he could have achieved with a reasoned, fact based argument."
Ok pheonsom. Let me ask a travel related question. Who is the Queen of Australia?
Steve who is the dictator of the USA ?
"""Steve, and so many others are clearly paid trolls.""Where can one apply for this job?"
"Steve is a true Trump genius. He figured out an Austrailian 'wouldn't be voting for Trump' from what he said, not because he lives on the other side of the world. Anyone who reads the scientific facts and figures out what the whole world already knows, 'is a mask crusader""We have millions this dumb, I just hope the rest can rise up and defeat their leader. Because they truly are mindless.."
"Queen Elizabeth.The US doesn't have a dictator. We have a president. Those are both facts. The individualism of Americans is my opinion based upon observation and knowledge of generations of people of all colors and from all countries coming here to actively make a better life for themselves and family. Those types tend to teach younger generations to be individuals responsible for themselves. Have any of you haters ever stepped out of a blue state echo chamber?Edited: 3:56 pm, June 24, 2020 "
If they had a 2nd amendment in Australia she would have been overthrown a looooong time ago.
"Keep going Steve M,Don't stop now!I think you're on a roll..."
Caesars properties in Vegas opened June 12 with an optional mask policy. That lasted two weeks. Required masks beginning today.Only going to get worse before it gets better
Steve M a president? Well that’s something new to me he sure doesn’t act like a president nor is he even remotely presidential he is more along the lines of what people would call a dictator but then again Have you stepped out of your red state mentality? To deny the fact that Trump is anything less than a dictator in the making is to deny the truth and to be looking at our country through red tinted glasses. the United States of America was a land of what people thought was opportunity however when really looking closely at our nation it is easy to see that it is a country full of white privileged men who have a hold on all opportunity People of color while trying our hardest to get out of the social stigma that we were born into or came over from are still just trying to get our basic human rights this country promised Its citiZens Instead the people in power will never relinquish their power especially with a dictator in the seat of the President of the United States. The inequity in this country is blatantly clear if you haven’t been watching the news recently you would’ve noticed the protests that are going on. I’m sorry this goes against your confederate dreams but the reality is our country is run currently by privileged CIS white men who’s sole purpose now to continue to fill their pockets at the expense of the rest of us. Where a mask and just shut the F up Your obsession with the queen of the Commonwealth of Australia has really gotten you down don’t worry I’m sure that once you look into your own country instead of someone else’s you’ll find plenty of reasons why people around the world currently look at us as a bunch Of bumbling idiots self righteous POS freedom fighters that are fighting for freedom to hurt others
"It may not shut down, but a bunch of people working right now wont be for long. Vegas was pretty empty when I was there, and I'm betting itll go even further down now."
"angelina, throw some paragraphs in there. Nobody can read that hot mess."
Sorry I use speak to text. My nailsAre long. Careful or I’ll scratch you

Are you all slating our Wee Liz because Meghan is thinking of running for president?Trump is a fool and a dictator.Free Palestine!
"When i first made this post Vegas was just reopening, after everything i have read over the last few days it reallyt does look like vegas may end up closing again. So sad about this but I understand why if it needs to happen."
"Yeah Graham it does. That said, things move so crazy fast who knows how it'll look in a week."
