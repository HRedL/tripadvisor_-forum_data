"Thanks for this Bean. Is there any talk of cancelling/restricting events or closing tourist sites to contain the spread? I realize that as of today, there are only 18 cases and no new ones according to your link. I'm not suggesting this should be done. However if hysteria sets in, our trip to Ireland could be very different than we originally planned."
Thanks for this great post Bean.Some local St Patrick’s Day events have been cancelled but as of yet the Dublin St Patrick’s Festival is going ahead. This may change as the situation develops. There have been guidelines issued for those running large events. Older people and those with pre existing conditions are advised to stay away from mass gatherings.New cases of people infected with the virus tend to be announced around 7pm every day.
This is a good addition to TripAdvisor https://www.tripadvisor.com/COVID-2019
I'm keeping a positive outlook about the future and have booked our flights to Ireland for this September.It helps that a couple of days ago Aer Lingus now has a 'book with peace of mind' policy which means there are no change fees on new bookings. And of course I've purchased travel insurance.
This thread is a good idea.At one point yesterday the front page of the UK forum had six posts asking about the Corona virus. Best keep it together! In all ways.
"Thank you for this very helpful post. We are hopefully heading to Dublin on March 19 to visit our daughter who is studying at Trinity for the semester. As long as there are no travel restrictions, we will go ahead with our plans. Also hoping that daughter's program isn't canceled, but we are prepared for anything."
"Not scheduled until mid May, but starting to get nervous."
More parade cancellations - Greystones and Sligos 50th Anniversary Celebration parade has also sadly been cancelled.Wise decisions in current circumstances.
"Hopefully better weather will kill it all off, we dont get flu epidemics in the summer.On the bright side, there will be a lot of cheap cruises on offer."
This is what I've been thinking too fuchsia.
"We have cancelled our British Isles cruise and Ireland trip and will rebook for next year. We didn't want to get caught up in itinerary changes, quarantines and according to th Daily Mail this morning, possible pub closures! We will watch carefully for deals on cruises for next year."
"Cork CIty Parade, which is the second biggest in the country is now off. To be honest, I think it's inevitable that the one in Dublin will be canceled."
Dublin Parade cancelled.
"I thought it was inevitable. I didn't expect it to take 2 minutes for my prediction to be proved right!It's 100% the right decision. If you look at the outbreak in Germany, there's a strong correlation between the number of cases and the area of the country that celebrates Carnival, which is a very similar gathering of a large number of people.Edited: 11:08 am, March 09, 2020 "
I had posted it on a new thread slightly earlier as I felt it was a significant development and was afraid travellers would miss it in this one. Sorry for the duplication.
There's no problem with that.I suspect they were both canceled centrally and local radio here just ran with the local story
"Thanks for this thread, Bean and for those keeping us all up to date. We are scheduled to arrive in 13 days and will need to weigh all the facts and make some tough decisions.  I am trying to plan ahead for not only what the situation will be when I arrive, but looking ahead to the end of my travel almost two weeks later. Travel-wise, I'm concerned about possible public transportation disruptions that could stem from putting travel restrictions in place, or even illness of train and bus employees. I hope it never gets to that point, but realistically can't rule out that possibility. We rely solely on public transport to get around.Stay healthy everyone!"

"My father, his fiancée (who are in their 50's and 60's) and I (I'm in my 30's) are due to go over there at the end of May (their second time, my first) and this whole thing with the virus really sucks and is screwing with this vacation. I'm not sure yet if we're going to be able to go now :( My father and his fiancé are both in the exact age group that the virus is heavily effecting. I'm not sure if we'd be able to postpone the trip or not or just wait until next year, which would suck. I'm really hoping this turns around in the next few weeks so we can still go."
Good that this post is now a sticky. Thanks Bean for the timely update.
"Appreciate the information Bean, especially the phone numbers. I will make sure I have them when I visit next week. Laurie"
"Bean- We fly over on 20 March, so thanks for the updates.Hopefully the Tuesday night session at O'Donovan's Hotel in Clonakilty isn't impacted...I've built it up pretty big to my wife. Where else can you listen to some good music, and wander outside with your pint to pay respect to a WW2 war-hero monkey's final resting spot?"
"The Book of Kells exhibition closes from tomorrow until they decide to reopen it again.There has been a case in Trinity College, so precautions are going to be higher there, but people should expect a lot of these closures over coming weeks."
i am booked for apr 30 from canada and am trying not to think too much about whether my trip will be cancelled or not :( but worried for sure.
"Many Thanks Bean for your thread. Unfortunately, knowing this will only get worse in the coming days over the next several weeks at the least. My thoughts and prayers are with the ones effected at this time and hoping they have a complete recovery."
"I am scheduled to fly out April 14th, in a little over a month. I luckily purchased travel insurance but I really would rather stick with my plans and go as I am in decent health and not too worried about that other than the possibility of spreading anything if I come in contact.This will be my 2nd trip to Ireland and since I rarely travel abroad (or travel in general), really don't want to waste my time and money to spend the little time off I get in my hotel or wandering empty streets because places are closed."
"Jaxtron, have you checked your insurance coverages to see if you are protected and what for ?"
"Will this post continue to be the best to visit regarding updates on closures? DH and I are scheduled to arrive in Dublin on April 17th for 8 days then on to Edinburgh for our anniversary. I have scheduled a few activities in both countries. Since this is a fluid situation, I guess we will just continue visiting this forum to see what happens over the next 4 weeks. Thanks"
"My sister is dealing with cancer so when scheduling the trip, I made sure to buy insurance for the initial flight and hotel (package deal) and book hotels and tours that allowed cancellation. I think I should be able to cancel without a loss but I really hate to do so it was one of the things I had to look forward to when dealing with stressful work and family life. Also, it would be one more person canceling and putting a hit on the businesses in Ireland.I will give it a couple more weeks and see how things are going. If it appears to just be getting worse and more things are closing or becoming unavailable, I may have to cancel and try rescheduling. I will be checking back often. Thanks to those keeping info coming about how things are going over there."
Some local bnb owners are already dealing with cancellations. The Galway-based tour buses seem half empty as they pass through Clifden.
"Pretty drastic measures just announced from now until the end of the month- Schools, colleges, childcare shut from tomorrow- Cultural institutions close also- Gatherings of 100+ indoors & 500+ outdoors cancelled- People coming through ports & airports to self-isolate if symptomatic- Work from home if possibleHonestly, I think this will go on longer than the end of March, possibly until May.If you were coming here for a walking holiday, you are probably OK; it is low risk and the only problem is if hotels, restaurants or B&Bs decide it's not worth staying open. Otherwise, at this point I would be reconsidering my plans if they were more than a couple of months away"
"Just for some context, currently the infection rate per capita is a little above the USA, but well behind France, Germany, Spain etc., never mind Italy where it is 30x higher or so."
"I really feel for all those in Ireland who depend on the tourism industry for their livelihoods. I know confirmed cases are relatively low, but so are the numbers being tested ( as they are in the U.K. compared to other European Countries) We’re being told here that the infection rate is likely to peak in mid - late April, so theres a way to go yet unfortunately."
my flight is booked for Apr 30/20- keeping my fingers crossed for sure too.
thank you Bean for this thread too! I am playing it by ear and wearing gloves at work and washing my hands a lot to minimize risk of contracting it. My flight to your beautiful country isnt until Apr 30/20 . I am in reasonable good health and will be so disappointed if i have to cancel my dream trip :( But if that happens it will only be a delay because I am going to Ireland this year come hell or high water lol anyway thanks again for the thread and keep up the good work :)
"I want to add my gratitude for this thread. We are booked to fly over on April 21st. While it's looking less and less likely that we will be going, I'm still very thankful for all of the information that's shared here...especially in this thread. For our Irish Experts, be well and know that we WILL make our way over eventually. Tourism will rebound and I'll raise a glass in the land of my ancestors. I still can't wait!"
We fly out tomorrow. Until my flight is cancelled I plan to come. Is this crazy? 2 healthy young 50's folks from the US.
"There are a few things to consider before travelling I think. How good is your Travel and medical insurance? How would you cope if circumstances changed and you couldn’t make your flight home? Will the closure of museums, castles, other tourist sites have a negative impact on your holiday?Shops pubs and restaurants are remaining open ( for now) The scenery is always open so you can still see the ROK, CoM Connemara, Dingle Peninsula etc. We are being told here in the U.K. that up to 10k people might be infected but have no symptoms and/ or haven’t been tested. And our government hasn’t even banned large gatherings yet, let alone closing the schools. Remains to be seen if that’s the right call. Very difficult decisions for so many people.Edited: 3:24 pm, March 12, 2020 "

"We were supposed to go to Dublin next week, mainly to visit our daughter who was doing a semester at Trinity. Her program was cancelled today and she has to be out of Dublin by March 15th. I've cancelled the hotel and now I have to call Aer Lingus and see if we can get a voucher to use later. We booked these flights back in early December, before we even knew about this virus.My daughter is so sad. She absolutely loved every minute she has spent in Dublin and hates that she has to leave."
So sorry to hear this. I’m sure you’ll agree that health comes first - but really feel for your disappointment. I hope you are able to rearrange your visit soon x
"Please remember that you may be healthy and fit, but you are still capable of carrying the virus to those who are not.The authorities here are trying to break the chain of contact between people to slow down the virus. It may not be possible to stop it completely but if it is slowed down at least the health facilities and staff have a better chance of coping.It doesn't help to panic over this but it has to be taken seriously. People travelling around on public transport when it is not necessary are creating the crowd situation that makes it difficult for people who have to travel to work to maintain the social distancing needed.Please, if you can, cancel and/or reschedule."
"Post #66, well said Donerail. And Kudos to Bean for the timely updates."
Thanks for the updates Bean.
"Apologies if this is duplicate information already posted elsewhere.I received an email from Kilmainham Gaol this morning announcing they are closed and they are being kind enough to issue refunds for reserved tickets already purchased.""Following Government advice, Kilmainham Gaol Museum will be closed until 29 March.This is a precautionary measure to minimise the spread of Covid-19. Ticketholders for tours during this period will automatically be refunded over the coming days.We apologise for any inconvenience caused and thank you for your understanding.""Also, Aer Lingus updated their policy to now waive all change fees across all fare types, even for the nonrefundable discounted fares we were holding since November. So this is terrific news. We will have to pay the fare difference of course but we can now afford to reschedule the trip sooner than anticipated.Edited: 12:41 pm, March 13, 2020 "
Thank you Bean for all the information and the updates. Our Ireland trip is planned for May 20th and are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to travel. This will be our first time to Ireland and so hoping that this peaks and we can come see your beautiful country.
I will know for sure by Monday but it is looking like my May trip will have to be rescheduled for Sept. I have fought through the disappointment and am accepting of the change. I have also decided to go over for 4 weeks instead of 3 as a way to help ease said disappointment :) thanks again to Bean as well as the other members who are keeping us all updated on the latest developments - it is very much appreciated believe me xoxo
"You would have to be off your head to be coming to ireland now, everything closed down, we don't need people coming from other countres"
"Cathi Mac, greetings to Baddeck, we had such a great time there a few years ago! Sorry for IrishSun's somewhat rude post. It's an awful shame that you will have to postpone your trip to Ireland but hopefully the situation will be normal again in September and you will have a wonderful trip then!And yes, thank you, Bean! You're doing a wonderful job providing up-to-date information!"
"Cathy Mac, why are you making a decision on Monday? I'm asking as we have travel plans for May 20th and I was thinking about end of April to start reviewing on changing our plans."
"Just waiting for the 100,000 or so Irish to get back from Cheltenham now."
"Thank you for putting this thread together, Bean.Having so much helpful, factual information together in one place is a great resource for the board. Kudos to you."
"We were in Galway this morning and surprised to see the Galway Tourist Train driving around the town, full with visitors in both carriages. Kylemore is closed but I think the main car park might still be open to view the abbey from there."
"Many of us are lucky to be able to work from home (myself and hubby included).But there are so many who cannot afford to do so. So here is a HUGE thank you to all the people who are working away in shops, pharmacies, hospitals, nursing homes, doctors' and vets' surgeries, pubs, hotels, petrol stations, restaurants, take-aways, banks, post offices, airports, buses, trains... in short, just everybody who is still going out there every day doing their job dealing with the public and helping to keep the country (countries) going!And just spare a thought for the volunteers going out trying to help the more unfortunate in our society, for example the homeless.Next time you go into a shop or another business give the staff a big smile to let him/her know you appreciate them for what they are doing. Or better still, tell them!"
"My husband and I planned a 3 week trip to Ireland in May with the main purpose of walking the Dingle Way. (He is 74 yrs young and celebrating 4 yrs lung cancer free.) We have had a wonderful time planning our itinerary and learning about Ireland in the process (thanks to those of you who offered validation and encouragement!) and we hope to make it there yet, maybe in September. For now we will practice ""social distancing"", continue to enjoy hillwalking near home and ""training"" for the Dingle Way. We wish you all well. Stay healthy & appreciate every moment you have on this amazing planet. We're all in it together. Despite the hardships, we can't help but think the earth must be heaving a huge sigh of relief at the slow down of human activity. Thanks again for the posts."
Avoid to go anywhere
"Another source for masses is https:/… https:/… A lot of churches throughout the country appear to be set up for this.(Some NI churches are included, as are some in England, Scotland and the USA)"
"# 92 Despite the hardships, we can't help but think the earth must be heaving a huge sigh of relief at the slow down of human activity.Such profound words. Tom"
"I watched a mass, it was fascinating, never seen one before."
"#11Like you we are scheduled to fly to Ireland in May. We are flying via Aer Lingus. Their web site says changes to travel dates should be made by March 25. Question is what would be a safe date to change to? I am assuming September might be safe, but who knows!"
"We changed our end of March dates to August and rebooked via the Aer Lingus website, then rebooked our hotels directly too. My understanding of my new booking and fare is that there is no change fee if I need to rebook/change yet again.You might walk through a dummy booking process online and read all the T&C's and see if your new fare/understanding is the same as I received on Friday.Hope that helps."
"#108Thanks for the input. Our flight to Ireland is not until May 28. On Aer Lingus web site they say if you want to change dates to go on line and change by March 25. I don’t know if that is a deadline or if we could wait until mid May and make decision and change at that time.Somehow based on how long it has lasted in China, I don’t think the situation will be settled in either the USA or Ireland by May 28. Have been to Ireland twice before once in early September and the other time early October. Had really looked forward to longer days in terms of daylight by going last of May.Really appreciate all the current information being provided by this thread."
Same here. We’re scheduled to fly from US to Shannon on 5/5. It’s hard to imagine how things will be in six weeks after so much has happened in the last week
Our plans are for May 5 and I’m unsure how late to wait to decide what to do.
Did you go as scheduled?
Thanks for the alert. Will check later for update

"We have had to cancel our trip due to the virus. It makes us very sad but I want to say that it has been a total pleasure dealing with all the hosts we reserved with, especially Hill Walk Tours. From day one they were right there to answer all questions via email and when it became apparent our trip was not going to happen they immediately wired our total refund (minus small deposit) to our bank account in the states. We are hoping to book again one day & will definitely choose Hill Walk Tours again. Now, if only American Airlines was even a fraction that fair and easy! Be well, Ireland. With luck we'll see you yet. ❤️"
If it has to be it has to be and hopefully people will adhere to the rules for just a few more weeks.I can see the divorce courts bursting at the seams when this is over ... :)
"Thanks for the updates, Bean. Are people now required to wear masks when is stores? Interesting about being stopped by the Gardai. Stay safe everyoneEdited: 10:10 am, April 20, 2020 "
"Face masks are very difficult to get, a lot of people sew their own. Our local newsagent had ""single use"" face masks for sale at a whopping €2.99 each. I'll make my own for when the face mask requirement comes in which might be sooner rather than later, for the moment I wear a light cotton scarf over my lower face when I go into the supermarket or newsagents. I wash it after use.We were stopped last week by a garda patrol, just before the Dublin/Kildare border. Our car has a Kildare registration and we were just going home after having been out. A very nice young female garda (keeping her distance) asked us where we were going. I told her that we had been shopping and had also got petrol at the petrol station which happens to be in Co. Dublin and were just driving a few hundred metres more to get home. I think she was going to ask us whether she could have a look in the boot to check for shopping bags in order to verify our story but just then one of our dogs (the big one, the little one couldn't reach as far as the half open window) stuck his head out of the window and gave the officer a big grin. She burst out laughing and waved us on... We didn't mind being stopped and checked, there are so many people chancing their arms at going for unnecessary drives.Edited: 11:47 am, April 20, 2020 "
"Clauds, love the bit about the doggy grin.  Here in the northeast a ""cottage industry"" of mask production....pun intended.....has emerged. I consider a mask absolutely essential for any activity where 6ft social distancing is questionable; but IMHO gloves are every bit as important. While my food/rx shopping has been only within a 2 mile radius; I've not heard of anyone being stopped by police at ""state"" lines.  Our vehicle registrations are by state, not county. Any of you frequent posters have stories in that regard?"
"I use a single use mask for visits to the supermarket only. It seems a terrible waste to dispose of these after one use.We got some industrial type masks from Builders Providers back in February for our son who lives in Hong Kong. There were none available over there. A couple of weeks ago he sent us a box of surgical masks that he was now able to purchase in Hong Kong. These are sitting in our other son's home, that we can't visit, as well as our grand children. We only shop once every ten days or so, so we don't use many.For those who may be looking for masks, think, car paint spray services, builders providers etc"
"Please do not use the ""BandBIreland.com"" web site to book your stays in Ireland. They refuse to refund the ""booking fee"" under any circumstances, even during the global Covid-19 pandemic.Our Ireland road trip was planned following a Princess cruise out of Southampton. Our airfare was also included in that Princess cruise. Princess cancelled the cruise due to Covid-19 restrictions. So our road trip through Ireland had to be cancelled as well, through no fault of ours.We had booked several Ireland B&B stays through BandBIreland.com four months in advance. I requested a refund due to the Covid-19 restrictions, and they refused. That is very bad business practice.I would recommend not dealing with this company, but if you decide to use their services anyway, when you decide to actually book, I suggest that you book directly with the B&B instead and skip the ""booking fee""."
"it is interesting looking at these posts. I have recently postponed our tour of Ireland from October this year through to late August of 2021. We intend to do this tour and then a cruise with Irish music leaving out of Barcelona. That was cancelled and postponed until Sep 2021. Our irish tour offered from March to transfer to a later tour for up to one year later although if you did not transfer, you lost the deposit, at that time. Coming from Australia, we are currently banned from overseas travel and they say this ban will be the last thing lifted. Hence I was keen to get new dates for our travel a long way after it was booked for. I do hope that pubs and restaurants do open much earlier than September next year. we for one will miss out and I have many on my list. I wonder if they will just make it compulsory to have bookings and limit numbers which allows trade and businesses to remain viable. Here all restaurants, clubs and pubs are closed but many are doing take away or home deliveries. I hope in Ireland that is allowed soon. But we seem to have similar moving restrictions. I think the new normal will be around for a few years, ie social distancing and limits on numbers at any event even when parks, playgrounds, schools universities and shops re open. Good luck everyone and lets hope and pray that travel is again an option at least in 2021. Really want to visit Ireland and live our dream that is over 2 years old."
"thanks for the updates, Bean."

"I just canceled my July planned trip to Ireland. I am so sad!!! According to the phased reopening plan, hotels will not open until Phase 4 which is at the end of July. I will wait anxiously until next year to travel to your lovely country!"
"Have an August 9th golf trip for 7 days. Yes, no, maybe ?"
I am very pleased to see a measured approach to opening up. It makes for a better chance of not having to up restrictions or at least not as often. I am pleased now that my trip is not until August next year. I wonder though if self isolation for 14 days ( assuming you can do this in a hotel) would have to be built into any trip. Will have to make sure before booking anything. Will watch with interest. Safe lifting of restrictions all and patience as we negotiate the new normal until any vaccine arrives if it does.
"So you expect the self quarantine to remain in effect all the way into phase 4 of that plan (August 10th) ? I know it's impossible to predict, but to me, that is the main hurdle left if you look at the *tentative plan*"
"Thank you, just wanted your opinion on the 14 day quarantine issue as if that could change for incoming passengers by August. Appreciate the info."
"Hello,I had a trip to Ireland planned from 3 June to 17th. I booked a tour with a tour company which will likely have to cancel the day tour (Kylemore Abbey etc.) set for 13 June. Tour company has not cancelled and is invoking its (punitive) cancellation policy, only returning 75% of tour price if I cancel. This seems abusive since it it likely they will have to cancel this group tour anyway but if I preemptively cancel, they keep 25%. Is there a recourse or tour board I can contact to lodge a complaint? This is the only company doing this. All others have been honorable. I understand the impact is difficult but why punish the client?Thank you!"
"Hello!I see your post and would like to know, if you care to share, how American Airlines handled your booking. I'm booked for 3 June on AA for my trip to Ireland which isn't going to happen then. Sad.Thank you"
"monicat, you could also read the threads on the Air Travel forum or post there (tripadvisor.ie/ShowForum-g1-i10702-Air_Trave…), you might get some relevant information."

"Hello,I booked a family vacation (our 50th Anniversary) to Ireland flying from Connecticut via Aer Lingus for this July 5-11 2020. I see on the ""Ireland Re-opening Plan"" tourist type activities will not be open until Phase 4 - beginning July 20th. My family is multi-generational consisting of Seniors, Adults/teachers , and children/students; 15 in total. Based on the Ireland Reopening Plan we need to cancel and rebook for July 2021. We need to wait until July because summer is the only, in common, time all the teachers and students in our group have off from school. Unfortunately, Aer Lingus is not allowing us this rebooking; they have only offered 330 days in advance. I've asked them to help us rebook for July but they are unrelenting and only suggest we cancel without refund. The airfare from Connecticut in July for 15 is about $15,000 so their suggestion is not helpful and rather frightening for us. My questions are:1) If we don't cancel and come this July 5th, Is it true Dublin will be closed to international travelers? I wonder if they will allow us to fly in, but Dublin tourist activities will be closed. Not much reason for us to come as tourists if nothing is open. 2) Assuming international travel is allowed from the USA to Ireland, would Aer Lingus disregard Ireland's re-opening plan and allow tourist to fly into Ireland/Dublin even though most tourist spots will still be closed? I'm really confused why Aer Lingus would not be following Ireland's own re-opening plan.Not sure if anyone can answer either of these questions, but would be interested in any insight.A frustrated Aer Lingus customer (who should have booked DELTA)!HENMAJ"
"As someone who was scheduled to go in August, I don't understand your issue. You can cancel and get a credit and then when the booking window opens, you just re-book for next year. Yes, this sucks, but you will have a credit for the full amount (no change fees), and then you re-book in a few months."
Not true for Aer Lingus. That maybe true for the US airlines - but NOT Aer Lingus! I've spoke to Aer Lingus and sent a query to them. They have only offered vouchers for rebooking if your flights were before May 31. This policy does not extend to our flights in July.I assume you booked with a USA airline - lucky you!
It's ON THE FRONT of their website right now.
"WOW, Very Interesting especially since they just responded to me yesterday without this change. Thank you for letting me know. This makes all the difference in our plans. Maybe my query to them helped change their minds!!Regards,HENMAJ"
I read the notice and I guess I have to call them because there is no mention of vouchers / e-credits. Only mention canceling and refunded the eligible amount; which I was told only included taxes. No mention of booking 330 in advance or being able to book further out. So still not sure what they are really offering.To be continued!!HENMAJ
"Thank you - you've given me hope!!I don't have much choice but to hold on for either a voucher or a cancelation by Aer Lingus. I saw on a facebook group that the most recent voucher offer was for travel up to June 30th (maybe that is your offer). Although they did not post it on their site; doesn't help us anyway because my family is leaving on July 4 and July 5.In the past, my family had very good luck with Aer Lingus, but this experience has tainted my confidence in the airline! I could have booked Delta, but didn't because Aer Lingus flies out of Connecticut, which is so much easier for all of us vs JFK. I know the virus is no ones fault, but they could have handled this better!I certainly don't want to fly to Dublin in July and be unsafe, or have to quarantine and/or have most tourist sites closed! I guess this is a lesson. Live and LearnThank you again for your hopeful advice!"
Ryanair have announced they are resuming 40% of flights from 1st July and have released a video on new rules for its flights.https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-ryana…https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52629644We are supposed to fly 6th July LBA-DUB and Ryanair is asking me to check in.Looking at the Covid roadmap I can't see anything about hotels reopening in the 5 stages or whether overseas visitors will be allowed into Ireland?
"Right I think I've found it in Phase 4 which operates from 20th July:https:/…cultural-and-socialSocial and recreationalHotels, hostels, caravan parks, and holiday parks for social and tourist activities can open, initially on a limited occupancy basis (or number of people per square metre), and then increasing over time. Social distancing measures are to be followed.Hotel bars remain closed.------------------------So that's our trip scuppered. Wonder if Mr O'Leary will give a refund or voucher....."
"Sorry about your trip to Dublin having to be cancelled, bronia! I hope you'll get a refund or at least a voucher from Ryanair and be able to reschedule your visit. They seem to be inconsistent in dealing with this issue. Friends of ours were supposed to fly to Porto with Ryanair for their annual reunion with school friends this month. Two weeks ago they had an email from Ryanair to say that the flight was cancelled and that the price of the flight tickets would be refunded to their credit card within two weeks...We were due to go to Donegal this weekend (self-catering) but obviously that was cancelled. Last week I had a phone call from the manager of the cottages to say they would reopen on the 20th of July and would we like to take up ""our"" house then. Three guesses as to our answer. So if things improve, people behave and no further lockdown is necessary we'll be heading to Donegal in July. The pubs will still be closed then but we don't care about that since we're strictly keeping the social distancing rules and wouldn't be interested in going to a pub or restaurant.A few months ago I was going to book a foreign holiday for later this year but then the epidemic escalated. So no disappointment for us but I do feel very sorry for all those who had booked a holiday abroad with all the planning and reservations and deposits involved but can't go now.Let us know how you get on with Ryanair, bronia!"
"Thanks Bean!Just checked and Ryanair have no flights at all bookable for the rest of the year from LBA-DUB though they do from EMA and MAN etc so my guess is they have pulled out of LBA.Maybe I can get a refund, if not a voucher I suppose.Hotel is on refundable tariff so that's OK.This is my second trip gone up the shoot this year - Athens rebooked for October, fingers crossed!Yes, it is very depressing Bean ☹I hope you get to France eventually!Thanks Clauds! Will let you know how we get on with Ryanair.Have a lovely time in Donegal!Edited: 11:08 am, May 12, 2020 "
"I truly doubt that ireland will allow in international passengers in July. Wait and see hard as that sounds. I doubt the USA will have resumed flights, nor allowing anyone to leave or return until things settle down quite a bit. Even wanting to open up again, they will depend on domestic for quite a while until they allow others in or out. That certainly is the situation in my country in most of Europe, so probably in USA. You note there is no mention of opening back up the airlines in all the rhetoric happening now. I listen to USA news, so am aware of  I am not dealing with Ryanair, but I rebooked my Ireland holiday set for this September to August next year with no penalty. The airlines and tourism business will want your business even if in the future,"
"I have a tour booked for October. I haven't made my airplane reservations yet. Do you think everything in Dublin, Galway and surrounding tourist areas will be open by then?"
"yes, I did and they are still planning to go ahead as of May 15, 2020. They sent out an email saying that they are in touch with their vendors, and would keep us updated. I have not booked my airfare yet."
We cancelled our Dublin hotel reservation today.Next to get a refund out of Mr O'Leary as no Ryanair flights are flying out of LBA at all for the rest of the year.It's still asking me to check in though - and I bet they think they can change our flight from LBA to EMA or MAN. No.
"Our tour isn't until October, 2020. I think the tour company is hoping that everything will be ok by then."
"I'm being cautiously realistic in my trip this year. I have been reading and know that some of the travel companies are postponed. I'm scheduled to visit at the beginning of September. Has anyone heard whether popular attractions are even going to be open this year? I'm at the point where I will be very disappointed if I don't get to go, but at the same time, I do not want to spend the money if I can't see everything I want /the way I want."
Received email from Ryanair re flight is cancelled so applied for refund. We will see!
"@Bean - Thanks for always keeping us updated. Similar road map here in New Mexico, USA. Here is hoping everyone stays well."
"thank you! My trip is late October, I hope the summer sunshine has allowed everything to be open again."

when are you going?
Hello all. I'm finding it hard to understand what the quarantine rules mean.Can someone who flys into Ireland go and stay in an Air bnb and 'self isolate' there? Or stay in more than one place as long as they're 'self isolating'?Thanks in advance for any replies.
"Self-isolating means staying in the same place for two weeks, otherwise it wouldn't make much sense, would it? The idea is to keep contact with other persons to a minimum, so therefore you stay put where you are. Absolutely no moving to another Airbnb!And NO flaunting the law by disobeying the gardaí!!!"
"""that it [Ireland] is 1 of the countries with highest suicide rates""Eduardo, please do your research before you throw such a comment out onto this forum!You plan to fly from Los Angeles to Ireland so I assume you are a US citizen or live there. For your attention: the suicide rate in the US is way higher than in Ireland..."

"Hi Eduardo, if you are confident you can meet the self isolation requirements once you arrive in Ireland, I suppose the question is whether you’ll be allowed to travel from the US. Hopefully one of the regular US posters here might be able to advise on that. A couple of weeks ago I would have said that supporting a family member would not count as essential travel, (in the UK at least). Not so sure now, but again, it seems it’s the US rules that you need to be aware of."
That looks to be very positive and proactive. I hope it will be successful.
"Yes, indeed. I'd hope it would be an inspiring blueprint for other cities or areas to take forward as well."

"I predicted this would happen. I still haven't cancelled my August 11th trip. If they remove the 14 day self quarantine, it's game on!"
"Understandable, my point is that, in two months, things will be different than now. It's already happening more rapidly in the states. CEO of Aer Lingus just called for the end of the 14-day quarantine just yesterday. We will see, but August is a long time from now and there is no cancellation penalties so I plan to just wait it out and see how it all unfolds."
"I am with you TR561! Flight is booked for sept 1. Until I hear directly from hotel and B and B people that they don’t want international visitors I’m just going to keep on hoping.Edited: 6:49 pm, June 05, 2020 "
"Good news!I can travel anywhere in Kerry.I never leave Kerry anyway (why would you?)so it's basically back to normal for me.Edited: 5:35 am, June 06, 2020 "
"Great news for sure. We have flights booked for Sept 17-27, I am staying hopeful!"
"Hi.I'm from Germany, and we have booked a cottage in Belmullet for july 3-14 (booked it last year). It was a private booking, and we cant cancle it whitout 90% loss. The ferry does not refund the full price, because there are no more legal travel restrictions. And, yeah, we hope, that we can travel to ireland, because we cant change it to another date (because of School holidays in Germany)But here in Germany, the informations about ireland travel restrictions are really small - to nothing. I wrote an email to the irish consulate in Berlin, but they cant help me either. So, what do you mean? Is it possible, that we can travel to ireland? What i've heard is, that all travel is allowed - whit personal protection and avoid gatherings - no problem, my autistic child hate gatherings. But what is with the quarantine? when will this be lifted? Do you know something about it?Thank you!"
"At the moment anyone entering Ireland has to quarantine for 14 days, this is going to be reviewed in the !8th June, no one knows what will happen then."
"I'm afraid that you will have to wait and see regarding the quarantine. if you're planning to travel via the UK, then UK quarantine rules will also come into play.You also need to consider whether attractions will be open and remember social distancing."
"The plan is to travel to Cherbourg, France, and take the ferry to Dublin. And from there, we want to drive to Belmullet.I know, I have to wait for more information. The infections have been low in the last days and I really hope, that the quarantine restrictions will be lifted.Social Distancing is not the problem for us. It's in Germany too. You have to cover your face and you have to stay in distance. Disinfection spray is provided everywhere and the shopping carts are already sticky from the hand sanitizers. Sometimes so disgusting!"
"The last update on the Irish-ferries-website is from May 29, but since then, the travel restrictions in france have changed. All restrictions will be lifted up to July 1, that you can travel in the EU anywhere - except Ireland. This is what I have heard.Perhaps, it is not a good idea to wait for political decisions. But i can change the booking up to 72 hr before departure. Therefore I'll wait until June 28 when phase 3 get started and I hope, that up to this date, there will be more easings.This point sounds hopeful to me:https:/…world-europe-52937895""Phase 3Travel: All restrictions for travelling within Ireland will be lifted. There is no date set yet for people to be allowed to travel abroad again"""
Would anybody like to speculate on when the 14 day quarantine will be removed?Is there a chance it will happen in July? Could Ireland have a phased approach regarding what citizens they allow in similar to other nations? Possibly reciprocity?
"In case it helps, I was able to get into Ireland from the US. I am currently quarantine 14 days. At Dublin Airport Immigration, I was required to fill out a form. I was then asked what I was doing in Ireland and how long etc. I told them my wife is a Nurse etc. I was allowed to enter. Easy peezy lemon squeezy.I'll still adhere to all the rules and regulations. I don't want anyone, including myself, catching the virus.Does this mean that I am considered an ""essential traveler"" based on my narrative? Immigration seems to think so."
You going to Ireland?
I saw this so am confused on actual protocolhttps://www.kayak.com/travel-restrictions

"Bean, thank you for your honesty. The people of the Republic have done a lot to suppress the spread. I mapped out the 2km and 5km restrictions and that would not even get me to a main road. New Mexico has not imposed anything closed to what the Irish have had to do. I still commute to work about 40km one way.With that being said the ratio of infections to total population, if I did my math right at 1 in the morning, is still under 1%. I get that people are stressed about it. People I usually enjoy working with are freaking out this week. I just hope that nations can look beyond physical boarders, I know the USA is probably the first place that needs to do that. We have a very bad track record. I do still look forward to visiting and hope everyone is well."
"Hi. I am on this thread because hopefully I will get to Ireland in August next year, having deferred for one year from my intended visit this September. I any of you especially those from outside of Ireland are wondering why Ireland is being so cautious, we have in Australia just had a wake up call. Here our total cases as at today are 7400 + and for a long time we have been congratulating ourselves on being so good at all the restrictions. Suddenly with the lowering gradually of restricitions in Victoria, the state which was probably the most strict we have for the last week had more than 10 - high 20s a day, after weeks of 0- 8 nationally, It appears it is not likely to be the protests, but rather large families who are ignoring the generous allowances now in place and congregating in large numbers without social distance and travelling or going to work or shopping centres with symptoms. there may be a language problem and it is mainly in two large areas of Melbourne, but so scary. Our whole nation was close to allowing unrestricted travel within the country and now that is definitely not in new plans until this all settles down. That is why caution is required and why we cannot just up and travel even if we have low numbers in our state or country. Personally I am glad Ireland is being so cautious, so that is more likely to mean we will be able to go there safely in 2021. Patience people and no succumnbing to Covid fatigue or compacency. See you next year late to allow this all to come to a safer level.Edited: 3:17 am, June 23, 2020 "
"Yeah, but it doen‘t mean, that we‘re a nation full of corona infected zombies :-)The manager of one factory ignored the hygienic regulations, because of the costs. The workers from eastern europe lived with their families in cramped block of flats.Now, all flats are in quarantine and the district is in lockdown.The rest of us Germans are safe and not infected *wink*"
"Yeah, sure. The virus will never disappear and we have to deal with it. I think, we are now more cautions then three month before and we should be able to handle with local outbreaks. But there are many people (on thejournal.ie) , who are afraid of German tourists, because they will bring the second wave to Ireland, if the goverment ease the travel restrictions."
What I have just read:https:/…Will it happen? Will it also include to travel by ferry?
"It is likely to happen, I have already received an email from Aer Lingus offering me flights from 1st July. The airline lobby group and tourism lobby groups have pushed hard like publicans and other groups and they have caved in. Even the GAA have caved in on their original road map to full contact training. Reports from other countries like Portugal, Germany and elsewhere indicate that this could be a big mistake. I don't want tourists from virus ravaged countries here in Ireland."
"Keep calm.""The virus will never disappear and we have to deal with it.I think, we are now more cautions then three month before and we should be able to handle with local outbreaks."""
People who decide to travel here as soon as it is possible are certainly NOT cautious. Tell the families of those who have died to keep calm and see how they react.
"Many families in Germany have lost loved ones. But now, we have returned to normality. Besides we use face masks and sanitizer in public and follow the distance rules to keep the risk low.This seems more effective than a generally quarantine.We can't hide to infinity."
"Parts of Germany haven't returned to normality with some regions under lockdown again. Nobody (especially me) wants to hide but we have to be responsible. I agree with the Trinity professor who stated on radio this morning that for the moment all visitors who enter here should be tested and allowed to proceed if their tests are negative. This isn't a simulation game, it is real life."
"Here in BC Canada we are doing very well, people are for the most part following guidelines of social distance and hand cleansing protocals. We are gradually opening with strict guidelines for non transmission, many places require masks/face coverings. Our border to USA remains closed as they are having a difficult time containing the virus, too many people citing personal freedom and even ""it's in God's hands if I get it (or die)."" We are still closed to all tourists but we are ok to travel in province. My dream vacation to visit Ireland seems to always be pushed back for one reason or another. I look forward to seeing your country one day soon and hope you get a chance to visit my beautiful area of the world!Edited: 1:54 pm, June 24, 2020 "
"Please know many of us who have non-refundable travel plans hope to make it work (And that the government will allow) and be very, very safe and cautious and ultra responsible. I am in Seattle but have been very safe, sanitary and we do wear masks in public to protect each other."
Going on holiday isn't a right. You may think you are being safe and cautious but an airport is one of the worst places you can go if you want to remain safe and cautious.
"About time, too."
And I hope it is enforced unlike here.

"Yes, all visitors, including Irish people returning home have to complete a form notifying the authorities of the address where they will be self isolating for 14 days after arrival. You can find full details easily by checking on the Irish govt website."
"Hello everyone, is there anyone that could give me information about the situation in Ireland? Is it safe to travel there? Or everything is closed and it is hard to trip around?I am from Italy, so I won't need the quarantine, but would like to know if I should book my trip for august or not..."
"No, stay home, travel is how we got in this bloody mess in the first place. People who live in Kildare cant travel round Ireland at the moment."
"It’s very depressing. I watched a bit of RTE news online earlier, I think it said a 4 fold increase in cases in Ireland this week. Still low numbers compared to bigger countries ( US, UK) of course, but an alarming rate of increase if I heard it right. Anyway must try to stay positive..."
"informative link.....thanks Oma. It is indeed discouraging that guidelines/mandates are not being followed. leading to continued increases.  At this time, International travel is risky on so many levels. And86m,don't travel to Ireland. It would not be enjoyable and you would not receive the céad míle fáilte"
"Oma, it’s a terrible situation. Hopefully people living in Ireland will respond re Ireland, but in my neighbourhood, here in the UK, a number of small, independent, much loved businesses have closed their doors forever. Small real ale bars, cafe/ bakeries, independent clothes shops. Anywhere with limited floor space which means social distancing is impossible. We have a hitherto thriving Arts Centre here. The theatre, cinema, galleries and bar/restaurant are closed until spring 2021 at the earliest but we’re all afraid that the temporary closure will become permanent."
