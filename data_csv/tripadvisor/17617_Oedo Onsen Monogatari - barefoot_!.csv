Hi! I'll be going to Japan in May and we have plans to visit the Oedo Onsen Monogatari. It seems like a very fun place and reviews are good. My only concern is that everyone (from pics) seems to be walking barefoot. Is it possible to rent footwear by any chance? I just don't feel comfortable strolling barefoot at a place where everyone else walks around barefoot.
Just take a pair of flip-flops. I don't think they rent any footwear.
"Thanks for the reply! I could do that, but is that allowed though?"
"People take their own belongings and put it in the locker they provide. I don't know whether they allow flip-flops or any other footwear. One way to find out.Japan is a nation of clean clean clean everything, so I don't think you have to worry about going bear foot."
"Japan often has areas that require barefoot walking. Any floor that is covered by tatami requires you to take your shoes (but not socks) off. That means restaurants that have tatami seating, ryokans, and even changing rooms at stores where you shop. With Oedo Onsen Monogatari, the area where you shower before entering the bath will be off limits to shoes. Within the complex once you exit that area, you can wear socks indoors if shoes are prohibited."
"One concern may be athlete's foot fungus. I don't think this is going to be an issue in Japan. In fact, I have never heard of it being epidemic because of the aforementioned focus on clean, clean, clean."
"Welcome to Japan! If you don't like to walk barefoot, you could waer socks. I think it is not allowed to take flip-flop in the facility. I recommend that you get Japanese ""Tabi"" socks before you reach Oedo Onsen. Tabi is traditional Japanese socks, so they match up with Yukata. You can look various tabi socks at UNIQLO or the other shops."
"Bisqqq,Your concern is totally justified because people do contract athlete's foot from time to time in places where they walk barefoot. I don't believe they rent any footwear, so you should bring your own slippers. Except for the washing and bathing areas, I don't see any problem with anyone wearing them. The basic rule of thumb is that they don't want you to wear anything ï¼ˆe.g. bathing suits)when taking a bath, but that you have a right to protect your own skin when you are in areas where people are wearing yukatas.

"I remember being barefoot. t was weird at first, but its part of the experience, so you forget about it really."
"The world is full of surprises and different opinions on minute details. If you are worried about fungus, wear your socks or indeed a slipper like on board a flight at the dry area- which might be perceived as potential threat of fungus to other people, but that's okay. You can drink coffee with sugar or salt, as you like. It's fine unless you pour salt into other person's coffee (which might be similar to going into an onsen bath with towel or swimwear on when other person is not)."
