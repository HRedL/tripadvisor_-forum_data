I am a first time international travellor and am thinking of using byojet to purchase tickets have never heard of them are they any good?
"Book direct with the airline or, as a first-timer, talk to a reputable travel agent."
More than 50% of the reviews on this review site rate them as terrible:http://www.productreview.com.au/p/byojet.htmlI certainly would not trust them.
http://www.productreview.com.au/p/byojet.htmlread this firsti don't like the name either BYO JET
beat me by a minute lulu
"Go online to the web sites of the airlines concerned, and see what prices you can get. Then go to a travel agent and discuss what you have planned, asking for any suggestions for a better itinerary and/or a lower price.Our past three major trips, our travel agent has been able to make useful suggestions, and get us a price lower than we could find on the web."
"If you are planning a simple return trip from Melbourne to XYZ and back to Melbourne, I would suggest you use a website like www.skyscanner.com or www.webjet.com or www.kyak.com to get a comparison of fares available to your selected destination. Having selected the airline you want then go to that airline's website and book your ticket.If you plan a more complex itinerary - MEL to A to B to C to D then back to MEL - then as others have suggested, a reputable travel agent might be the best way to go if you are a novice.One online TA, but Australian based with real people to talk to at the end of real telephone lines are bestflights www.bestflights.com.au/cheap-flights/…We have used them a few times and been very happy with their service."
"Even on simple flights, my travel agent has sometimes been able to better the prices published on the airline's web site.Next year, there is a family wedding and my wife found a very good price with Hawaiian Airlines for one of our sons, and his wife and child, to fly PDX-HNL-SYD and return. On the off chance, I rang our travel agent and got a price almost $200 cheaper for the same flights.However, don't ask for help with the cheap European airlines: easyJet, Vueling, RyanAir, etc. They don't pay any commissions, so you would have to pay a fee to your travel agent to get onto the airline's web site and make a booking for you."
"^^^^ Good point about the LCCs. From their ""About Us"" -http://www.byojet.com/100_AboutUs.asp""Book online and save with over 500 worldwide airlines including Australian Low Cost Carriers like Tiger, Air Asia, Jet Star and Virgin Blue. International Low Cost Carriers like Easy Jet, RYAN AIR, Southwest, Spirit, and plenty more.""BIG RED FLAG there as the airline in upper case (my emphasis, but including the misspelling) expressly forbids agents reselling their tickets."
"yeah i just used byojet now to book a flight from australia to new zealand, im such an idiot, biggest travel scam, once u pay theyll give u error that something has gone wrong and thats it you carnt call them they dont respond to email im going to have to call my bank to sort it out. i used skyscanner and they use byojet also but when u find the flight u want just go to the air carrier you want to fly with and book it with them not a third party company arghh!!"
"They are liars - bad business practice - I have to go to Fair Trading Court with them!!!!Be careful with these guys!! They never indicate their booking terms and conditions. It's a lie when they claim ""NO BOOKING FEE"". They charge credit card fees, paypal fees and admin fees at the checkout plus hefty cancellation and rebooking fee regardless what special circumstances you have. Then you have to pay full fare for rebooking. It can be over half of the original ticket. I am going to Fair Trading Court with them!!! NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE THIS GUYS!"
"I have just tried to reserve my seat and found out that Southern China Airlines have not been contacted by BYOJET.COM. I have an eTicket number but when I use this number China Southern rejects this number. Now is Saturday and we leave on Sunday. The office is unattended but emails are being monitored at night, I have been assured when I ring their number, it is 6AM at the moment and I am panicking.A cruise, hotels and hire cars have been paid for and I do not know if I am on this flight! Will let this site know what is happening."
"Way too late for you now now but this is why when booking, whoever through but especially third parties, you should always go onto the airlines website once a ticket number and reference (PNR) have been issued and check you are in their system, and not just wait until the day beforehand.that way you have ample time to sort out issues like misspelled names or wrong reference numbers or complete mess ups or scams.Have you got a number for china airlines ? They may be able to help working off your passport details.Good luck."
"BYOJET does not supply an eTicket, nor do they supply at least an eTicket number automatically, now I know. To compound the problem, once I was given the eTicket number I had to log into China Southern in a special way, namelySurname/Given Appellationand their web site did not give that info. Without that trick, which I found out by ringing China at our time 5AM, one gets the message: ""Ticket not issued""! Panic! An English-speaking lady was on duty at that time, great! BYOJET had a message on the answering machine, but I was assured emails were being looked at at night. Similar problems with ""free airport shuttles"" to hotels. The hotel may not answer your emails with the booking of the shuttle, then one get told eventually one may have to ring the hotel or go to a courtesy phone, call and go to a shuttle bus stop. Now I know! The simple request during booking to be picked up leads to no automatic response how to go about it."
"Yes, you are right, but the numbers on BYOJET's confirmation were not China Southern eticket numbers, just other numbers, to which China's software does not respond. As a customer I have to go back and request an eticket number, this should be automatic once the funds have gone from BYOJET to the airline concerned."
"Thanks, Larry. Another fond dream in the toilet. When I look back on the live chat, I.can identify the cold heart of the woman I had chatted with. I guess I'll be calling the carrier directly, since I have no travel agent.. British Airways here I come! I love ""Oz"" but there are defrauders everywhere on our aching planet."
"If you had looked properly you would see that all of these fees were specified before you paid as are their Terms and Conditions, which you have to indicate you have read before you pay!!!!!!No airline will accept any excuse/reason to change the booking without cost. Thts why you pay more to be able to be ""flexible"""
We used them a couple of years ago and they were excellent.
"Just booked flights with these guys only to be told that their prices and flights on the web site are not correct, but for $120 extra we can go to the next available fare. Wont be dealing with company ever again!"
"Well I can certainly relate to Paul's experience. Mine was almost identical. I booked a flight from Perth to Bangkok, only to be told days after I received their confirmation number that that price was no longer available, but they could get me another seating on the same flight for about $300AUD additional. In the interim they had processed my credit card payment. This is after they had already approved and rejected an earlier booking requesting additional money for credit card fees and service fees. It is interesting to note they are still advertising this same flight on their web site, for a price they came back to me and said was not available. This is nothing short of a scam...... Advertise low fees and then once the flyer is hooked in, tell them you need more money. I would never use this agent and recommend you stay well away from them. I will be making formal complaints."
"BE very careful, I am in the middle of dispute with BYOJET right now. They telephoned me telling me my flt shedulle had changed. A connecting flight had been cancelled and I was required to leave some four hours early and then wait 9 hours in KL for my ongoing flight. However they said if I accept the change a Five Star Hotel plus free transfers would be provided, I replied Ok however a reasonable hotel would be OK not necessary Five Star. They then emailed me the changed schedule and instructions to collect the Hotel Voucher from the Auckland MH airline office. Four days later they now say Hotel not guaranteed and if I want to cancel a fee will be charged. This is an ongoing dispute. Be very Careful.,"
Further to Be Very Careful.After Four Days and my starting to write such reviews a RESULT.Now informed HOTEL VOUCHER for unscheduled 9 hour stopover is now being mailed direct to me.Congratulations BYOJET
"Do NOT use BYOJET. They will charge your credit card and not book your ticket - and then when they tell you, they refund and that refund is not necessarily for the same amount because of exchange. They are crooks!!!!"
It will cost me the same as booking a new flight to change a date.....Says it all really!If I had booked thru the airline direct it would cost $120.00 to change dates.Below is my estimated charges for changing a date from BYOJet:We have assessed your change request and the total cost to change your booking is as follows:Option 1)CHANGE FEE: AUD175.00 per personTAX AND FARE DIFFERENCE: AUD214.00 per personTOTAL COST: AUD389.00 per personQF 391 S 23 APR from SYD to NAN Depart 1300 Arrive 1850 on 23 APRQF 392 N 14 MAY from NAN to SYD Depart 0900 Arrive 1145 on 14 MAY
"Stay away from ByojetI saw a good ticket price online for Singapore-Koh Samui-Singapore.I tried to book but the website had problems. Once selected it wouldn't go to the next page.I talked to them through their web chat function who could only refer to a phone number. I call this number and get the manager on the line. He took note of my travel plans and promised to contact his IT department to fix the issue.Not long after I find I can book and continue to payment. In large letters I see payment has been successful and itinerary will be emailed.I'm happy as I got a good price going to a location I otherwise would not have gone and book (and pre-pay) the hotels.About 1 hour later I get a call that they won't issue tickets as the price obtained from the airline is higher. Again I talked to the manager and he claims the airline submitted the wrong info to them.During my earlier calls and chat sessions, nobody mentioned that the rate I try to book is not available anyway.As the same time, and still as I write this, their website shows a low price that is plugged into crawlers, drawing traffic to their website.I suggested they should absorb the difference and if not, at least part of it. But the reply was a definite ""no"".So there I am, with pre-paid hotel bookings that do not allow cancellation, but no air tickets. Only option left is to buy tickets at a price that for my budget does not justify going there. Conclusion: If a price is lower then you see elsewhere, don't trust it. It's a marketing stunt they won't fulfill. And if the price is not lower, then why book through them at all?Best is to avoid them at all cost."
"Worst customer service ever - rude telephone reps, slow email response (20 hours), quoted $1,800 to change my flight when the new flight was actually cheaper than my existing flight. They gave me a new quote of $880, when I emailed them asking for a breakdown of the extra costs they brought it down by another $100, still not answering my question of why these extra charges were in place. Use BYO as a search engine, choose the flights you want then book directly with the airline.."
"Do not use them. They are the worst site you could use. pay $10-50 more and be sure to book from other sites. They will publish a low price for you to buy and then once they get your money confirm that they couldnt get your ticket for the price you bought it for. To change you need to pay more - they can provide a refund but it todate i havent got my money. they keep prolonging, first by asking for your details again, then asking for approval from management and the story goes on. i would spend a little more and but from an established site"
"We agree! DO NOT USE BYO JET!We tried to book yesterday online, but the website refused our credit card. We called the bank--no problems with the card. Tried another card, same story, contacted online help whose only help was to tell us to call today when the office was open.Today the fares had increased by $200. I called and was told that ha ha, they could not give me the lower price BUT they would gladly contact their IT department and get back to me. When I asked how that could possibly benefit me since I wasn't getting the lower price anyway, she started to laugh.If we had booked yesterday through one of the other companies, we would have got it cheaper than it was today at byojet, and much cheaper than what we finally had to book with another company. So I wish I had read these reviews yesterday! Nevertheless, I think we dodged a bullet here and I'm grateful we didn't have some of the nightmares that some of you did.Try bravofly or ebookers. We have used both of them without a problem."
Not for the beginner i was caught out too dont get it wrong it will cost you so much it will destroy your holiday.
"Beware of BYOjet.I booked two tickets with 23kg checked baggage on an Air France flight from Madrid to Paris. When checking in online Air France told me there was no checked baggage on my ticket! An hour was wasted with an online chat BYOjet person who agreed I had paid for checked baggage but there wasn't checked baggage with the tickets I had purchased! Work that out.! Said the disclaimer meant I should have checked with Air France. Why then bother with a booking agent? When I arrived back in Aust I contacted BYOjet who did refund the extra money I had had to pay. However that was no compensation for the angst and stress of that evening while we wondered how much extra it would cost (aware of the huge prices in Aust) ,whether to cancel tickets, rebook, change accommodation etc"
"I learn' t the hard way, some of their flights are not refundable or changeable.I had to reschedule a flight & lost my money & am trying to claim insurance.They donot put it on the flight itinerary that tcikets are not refundable or changeable.Don't use them."
Feel ripped off myself. Booked a flight we needed urgently to get to Sydney for a family funeral. Suddenly the price jumped up at the end with some unexpected fees and in the end when I got my credit card bill it was all in Australian dollars. By the end I paid an extra $200 on the other fares other people were offering.
Beware of booking with byojet. Take printouts of all selections / bookings /baggage allowance made with you on your trip. I booked tickets through byojet to go from rome to athens then heraklion using aegean airlines. I specifically booked seats that had a 23kg check-in baggage allowance. On doing my online check-in with the airline today I noticed it says 0 baggage allowance! The pdf showing booking details from byojet conveniently does not provide any details regarding baggage allowance. I contacted the online byojet consultant who told me that I didn't have a baggage allowance. When I asked her to explain why I didn't have a baggage allowance she said she couldn't be definite and suggested emailing the office and one of the travel consultants would assist. I am flying tomorrow and am still waiting for a response. Unacceptable. I should have checked the travel forums before booking with them as I note this has happened to another traveller!
"Lets just say DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM !! Worst practices i have ever seen, i do not know how they are allowed to be in business!"
"I agree stay away from Byo jet. They falsely advertised a special deal travelling to Europe return on premium economy. Once I got to the airport though, I was told I was travelling economy one way. What a rip - off!Never ever buy online from these scammers. Poor show!!"
"I booked with them for the first time last night. Normally I always check against the airline prices on their own site. I didn't, BIG mistake! I paid $60 more for the total cost of my flights than if I'd gone direct to the airline!! No idea yet what their 'service' is like but I won't be doing that again.After reading other people's experiences (which I should've done last night!) I'm beginning to wonder why Tripadvisor uses this company to find flights for people. I'm beginning to lost confidence in Tripadvisor!!Edited: 5 years ago "

"I've used BYOJET for years, never had a problem, they even issued me a credit when I got caught having to pay additional baggage fees on my flight in Poland. Very friendly and courteous staff - in fact, I'm about to book with them again this week."
"Glad that I read the entire thread. I was thinking ""BioJet,"" and assumed that it was an airline that fueled its planes with used French Fry oil...Now I know better, and have been educated in the process.Thanks,Hunt"
"DO NOT RECOMMENDFilled in online Quote on Monday 27th Oct, called them 2 days later as I had no response and asked for quote online. They said they don't quotes on the phone (Red Flag). Asked them to mark my online quote Urgent as I want to fly Mid Nov.5 days later I called and they said they didn't receive my online booking quote - so I re-submitted. I still haven't heard from them.I don't think they can actually do the Flights/Hotel Package at what they have advertised and pretty sure this company is a SCAM."
"Thanks to all who have contributed. I was wondering why BYO Jet were the only people willing to book my flights (Oz-UK) a year in advance.NowI see why, I will avoid!"
i notice productreview website is actually negative review website.
Anshul - as a public forum all are able to post. So f you have a positive experience then please share it
"Very bad customer service, i have booked a ticked because they were promising a weighing scale with it, after a week i cakked them an they said thwy will refund the money which i paid for the postage. what motivated me to buy from BYOjet is the weighing scale and they nicely sais they don't have in stock . The call center manger Jenny Wong was supposed to call me as the CSR Monica's pronmise and i never got a call. very bad customer service and false promises. i will never book a ticket from BYOjet again. Highly NOT RECOMMENDED."
"Oracle17,I have probably missed some important points, as there were some words, that just did not translate to my weak English - I am from Mississippi, so US English is my second language, BUT, I am not sure what happened.If it was that they promised you a scale, and did not deliver, I once opened a bank account, where they promised me a toaster, but ran out. I closed that account, went across the street and opened another, and got a coffeemaker. Is that what happened?Good luck on the scale.Hunt"
"light -Novosibirsk(Russia)-Beijing-Guangzhou-Auckland 26/12/2014.74 years old women & 17 years old boy got stuck in Beijing. Because of multiple changes in the flights and the booking error in the tickets. Tickets are bought on the ""Byojet.co.nz""We contacted ""byojet"" on line, they suggested contacting the Southern Chinese Airlines because they made changes in flights, those in turn told that you bought tickets not from us, we aren't going to correct anything.So, Southern China Airlines changed the flights and did not provide the replacement because of booking error. They(SCA) simply did not let them boarding. The ”byojet denies the booking error, blaming the passengers of being late. As a result the grandmother with the grandson hanged at Beijing airport for 2 days and we found the only way out as to buy them the return ticket to Novosibirsk. The agency emailed that the tickets are non refundable, but offered tickets for other date. But who will go again after having such awful experience???We have got the evidence of this error from Southern China Airlines staff.Thanks “Byojet” !!!"
"Hi Elena,We are sorry to hear you had had some issues with your booking.We have reviewed the BYO and the passengers actually missed their connecting flight from Beijing to Guangzhou. They did have over 3 hours connection time.After speaking with the airline, they did confirm there was no cancellation of flights and the flight did depart as scheduled. Their notes confirm the passengers were a no-show.BYOjet must abide by the airlines fare rules and as these flights were non-refundable we offered to provide a quote for the next available option to assist with getting your family from Beijing to Guangzhou then on to Auckland, but we did not hear back from you.If we can be of any further assistance please don't hesitate to contact our Customer Care team on:PHONE: +61 7 3451 5400 or 1800 BYOjet (Toll Free within Australia)EMAIL: travel@byojet.com.auLIVE CHAT: click on 'LIVE HELP' @ www.byojet.com.auBest wishes,The BYOjet Team"

Never use BYO Jet. I have been on their customer care line for 95 minutes with no response. Just an inane electronic woman repeating over and over again that they value my call. And the website chat won't load. Crap aftersales service.
"Don't ever book with BYOJet. Worst aftersales service ever. I have been on their customer ""care"" line for 95 minutes listing to some inane electronic woman repeating over and over again ""we value your call. all of our customer care personnel are busy.... etc etc"" and the web chat site she keeps rabbiting on about won't load. Horrible"
Maybe too hasty. Apparently all their phones and website were down for several hoursEdited: 5 years ago

"Thank you all for this info, I was just about to book with them - not now!"
"Amazing. So someone complaints about issues with Customer care. And to solve it, Byojet refers to that same Customer care!"
Have had 3 bookings no probs and a 4th to europe pending august 2015. I do double and triple check bookings and leave plenty of time. A friend booked with a well known agency and spent the night sitting in london airport due to crazy short time for transfering between airlines. Have contacted the byo australian number with a minor question the lady was polite and helpful. So far good.
"Hi Gerry,Great to hear you have made a few bookings with us and are happy with our service. We hope your next journey goes smoothly and we look forward to assisting you with your future travel needs.Best wishes,The BYOjet Team"
"We have two issues with BYOJET:we have not been notified about change in flight details. We received advise after our call to BYOJET on another matter. The BYOJET personel was unprofessional and not customer orientted (politely speaking).We requested special meals on or flight to Berlin, BYOJET included them on travel documents but have not advised them to the airline. This caused unnecessary stress, discomfort and food issues on our flight. I can see similar issues other people had AS WELL. PITTY THAT I DID NOT READ COMMENTS ON BYOJET ON TRIPADVISOR..BE AWARE OF BYOJET..."
"Hi Kuba, Can you please confirm your BYO reference so we are able to look into this issue for you?Many thanks,The BYOjet Team"
Not sure if it is necessary .I have already exchanged a number of emails with BYOJET in this matter. Customer specialist replied to me advising that the team sent me two emails with changes in flight timing. I have received no such emails. The specialist also advised that BYOJET received confirmation from the airline about booking a special meals. I have requested BYOJET copies of emails sent to me and a copy of the airline confirmation. All I received were BYOJET internal procedures. So my discussion with BYOJET was useless and a waste of time.  Anyway the ref no is ￼BYO2630511.
"Hi Kuba,Thank you for providing us with your BYO reference.Please note when a schedule change is received by the airline, the system automatically generates a new PDF of your itinerary with the amended flight times. After reviewing your booking, it shows that there were 2 changes emailed to you. Could these perhaps have been received into your junk mailbox? As per our Terms & Conditions, we do advise clients to always check their flights at least 24hrs prior to departure as airlines can change flights at any given time.In regards to the meals, BYOjet noted these on the Global Distribution System when ticketing your booking and your meal requests then appear on your itinerary once your booking is completed. It is then at the discretion of the airline if they supply this request. BYOjet has absolutely no control over what the airlines choose to serve on their flights unfortunately. We are very sorry to hear that you did not receive your requested meals in this instance.A Customer Care consultant would be happy to contact you in regards to this if you wish to discuss further.Best wishes,The BYOjet Team"
Again the same.....your system generates pdf ...No I have not received your emails with pdf's in any of my mailboxes includingg junk mail....That is why I ask to provide proof that you sent emails....
"Thanks Kuba, one of our Senior Managers will be in touch with you to clarify.Kind regards,The BYOjet Team"
"Not recommended, they do not have the ticket confirmed immediately, which means, you might have a shock few hours later after u made payment for flight or hotel booking."
"Hi Aymen,Firstly, we're very sorry to hear you have had these issues due to an airline schedule change.Can you please confirm your BYO reference so we are able to look into this?Please note we do require all requests and confirmations to be received via email, so as to protect the client and BYOjet.As a Travel Agent we represent over 300 airlines around the world and when we quote our refund time it is a standard across all of our airlines. Some of the larger airlines are fairly efficient at refunds processing and some of the smaller airlines can take a little longer. We look forward to hearing from you.Kind regards,The BYOjet Team"
"I bought a ticket to Tel Aviv last night. I recieved an email from Byojet office this morning with a message informing me that they do not have the flight I booked last night. One of the agents by the name of Cornalius Ng was extremely rude to me. Next, they told me that I need to pay more inorder to book another flight. They even mentioned that skyscanner and cheapest flight.com put up these flights and their system does not get updated on the latest prices for flights. I am honestly shocked by BYOJET. PLEASE NOT EVER BOOK A FLIGHT WITH BYOJET. THIS COMPANY IS A FRAUD. I am definately going to inform the police about this company and let them investigate this matter cos I am not sure if they are going to refund my money. I spoke to one of the agents by the name of Norasikin Norhan and she said they could do the transfer today but not sure how long my bank would take to process the refund."
"@ Aymen_EzzYou have booked two tickets via a third party agency instead of one ticket directly with the airline. On top you picked your agency unwise. I assume that your overriding criteria was price with no regards on quality. And you did this all based on your free will.The only things you still seem not to do is to accept your mistakes and learn from it. Had you only invested 5% of the time before booking in reading and researching of what you seem to have invested now/after, you could have saved yourself a lot of troubles and money.If you buy two separate tickets there is no link between the flights. That is a risk you took and you lost the bet. So far to risk and reward.Just accept your mistakes and try to get some money back. But please do not find excuses which are even not consistent with your story.<<there would be no need to proceed with the trip>> <<Bad advise: As I said before they advised to cancel the ticket>> What advice do you expect if the trip makes no more sense?<<it seems that they offer inferior tickets because that way their profit margins are higher.>> It is a business and not a charity. And you were most likely looking for the cheapest tickets. What did you expect?<<no guarantees for anything even for the product/services you purchase.>> Maybe you once ask your lawyer girlfriend what an agency exactly is. As a clue and as you write yourself it has to do with providing you a service. Not even a top notch travel agency can guarantee for something out of their control.<<Refunds are trimmed significantly>> As per their T&C to which you have agreed to by your own free will.The only conclusion you should really make is 1.) Buy flights directly from the airline and to make sure that all the flights are on one ticket and 2.) Research with whom you are doing business before you depart with your money."
"@Flower A<<I bought a ticket to Tel Aviv last night>> No you did not. You asked an agent (and a dodgy one on top) to purchase a ticket based on an advertised fare for you and it seems that you paid in advance.<<they do not have the flight I booked last night>> It is called bait and switch. Promote a ticket too good to be true, wait till somebody pays and then ask for more money for a ticket which really exists.<<does not get updated on the latest prices for flights>> In short, they do not have life prices.<<THIS COMPANY IS A FRAUD.>> Technically they are not. That is why they are still in business. They are dodgy.In future please book directly with an airline. Their ticket prices are real plus you have a direct relationship with the airline and no agency between you and the airline.Hope you get your money back, but do not think it will be very fast."
"I know it's highly unlikely that I would get anything back and I provided my review for the benefit of other people. If you don't have anything to add for the benefit of other users, I don't think my personal situation is any of your business. I don't remember asking for anyone's opinion in my post."
<<I don't remember asking for anyone's opinion in my post.>> LOL. This is a forum!
"Well I have used BYO 3years ago for a direct flight Christchurch to Manchester return, - all good there and back. and a good price, and no problems. 3 days ago, booked another flight Christchurch to Manchester, and did have some problems in that after I had paid the monies over did not get a booking number (it didnt allow me to do so) and didnt get the ticket later that evening, - so I sweated... Rang my bank, who said money had been taken out and gave me a reference number to ring BYO the next morning. Of course I then had time under the 'sweat programme' to see all the bad reviews on BYO and thought - oh ...... and then I thought 'calm down' unsweat it out and ring them in the morning which the CHAT ladies said I had to do as they did not have all details - only the office would have. SO - I phoned in the morning, - got a wonderful lady JODI in Christchurch office of BYO who had it sorted out within 5 minutes., - Ticket came through OK, and all good. So for me, I would use them again."
"Looking for a cheap fare as we're travelling with whole family from Netherlands to NZ return (when finding cheapest fare with best connections counts!) But, we should have read this forum before we booked...BYOjet will confirm ticket via email, and then there will inevitably be a hiccup with the booking or payment (seems to be the standard issue in other reviews). They will say that while the issue is being resolved the fare is not confirmed, or that is has gone up already and then coerce you to rebook at a higher price. They will not hold the booking at the price you originally paid for a set number of hours like other companies. Moreover, they have some of the rudest customer 'service' staff ever. They interrupted me, talked over me, and hung up on me while I was asking a question. They repeatedly asked me to send my full credit card details over the email which is rather dodgy! My query got handed between branches and staff members like the office morning tea! In fact, it's possible they have international branch numbers but these are all routed to the same office, somewhere in the world where customer service is not valued.It seems that creating a booking issue, and then charging a higher price is a standard way for BYOjet to claw back profits from their bargain basement rates.I say spend your money with a company who deserves and appreciates your business!"
"Just for everyone's info: I hope you read this before doing any bookings with BYOJet. I've now waited my refund for 17 days. I have called 2 times, and send 3 emails. No one is giving any explanation why it has taken this long - but, they say they try to speed up my refund and possibly do it on Thursday 29/10. How good is that. I asked their manager to call me - instead customer servicer Cornelius from Singapore called me after hours stating that managers are not there anymore. No sorry, no nothing, he was very unpolite and advised that since I've already waited for 17 days, I can surely wait for 2 more days + 3 days for the bank to process this.This company is just one big hoax. We'll see if I ever see my money again - maybe next year. Think twice before you book anything with this company."
"My sister was quite wary when I first booked my flight from Australia to New Zealand via BYOJet due to the negative posts on this site. I am glad to say I was more than happy with my flights, Qantas and Air New Zealand, and encountered no problems with the bonus of saving just under $500(!) by booking thru BYOJet. I was so impressed that yesterday I booked my return flight back to Australia next week and once again saved a large amount of money."
"I am very disappointed in both KLM and BYOJET! Both companies appear to be profiteering on an unfortunate family health crisis regarding my parents, which requires me to have to return to the UK urgently from Perth. I already had tickets booked back in April to travel in December but needed to travel sooner (I am talking 5 days earlier then originally booked) I have made numerous phone calls (being on hold waiting 30-40 minutes sometimes), sent emails and supporting documentation regarding this. I was originally quoted a difference of $490 by BYOJET (which included both their and KLM fees) to amend the ticket to travel sooner. BYOJET advised KLM may have waived their fees if we sent supporting documentation which we did straight away and waited well over 24 hours for a response. When the response came via BYOJET they informed KLM rejected the claim and then were advised the fee was no longer $490 but had jumped up to over $1800! we had been waiting for them and their response! To say that I am disgusted is an understatement. I have even looked at other ways to get there cheaper and not use my original outward bound ticket, but I have been told by BYOJET if I can get another flight one way, which would be cheaper I would then loose my return trip home from Norwich to Perth. I understand that they are businesses but there seems to be absolutely no compassion shown at all for my circumstances!!! Disgusting customer service with BYOJET, when I called to talk about the issue one person told me sorry can not talk but have to wait for an email instead. Each time is a different person and they take so long to get back via email it is what a lot of this issue has been. I have traveled a lot with other travel agents and had brilliant experiences and would advise anyone at all that is considering booking through them DO NOT! you never know when your circumstances may change and there is absolutely no help here offered at all."
"I am so sorry to hear about your situation. Had you taken out travel insurance - and if so, those circumstances may have given you a better outcome?"
No they only cover if you want to go later not sooner on your flights
"USE AT YOUR OWN RISK - here's my experience so far:8 Dec 1:pm - booked tickets through their site and paid more than $4,000 on my credit card. Within minutes got email - YOUR REFERENCE NUMBERS BYOjet Reservation: BYO361XXXX and Confirmation Code(s) XXXXX - 7 mins after that another email ""Your flight unlocks exclusive discount hotels"" cross selling more SHIIIT. THEN another email Subject: ""Fare / Flight not available"" which went to read ""Thank you for choosing BYOJet. In this instance your booking is not able to be confirmed by the airline and cannot be ticketed."" and then offered two options - ""OPTION 1 The following alternative itinerary below may be a viable option for you"" and then tried to switch me to another airline and ""OPTION2 Cancel this booking request and a refund request will be sent to our accounts department for processing. Please note this may take 5-7 business days to show in your account depending on your bank’s processing times.""Well this seems like a classic bait and switch practice which is actually illegal under Australian Consumer Law - they did offer flights for the same price so technically they might get away with it, but it is not the airline or the times I wanted but they still took my money under false pretenses and claim it will take 5-7 days to refund when they took it at the click of a button - within half an hour of getting their email I asked ""please cancel and refund asap"" It's now 4 days later, no refund yet and no space on my credit card (because of their $4k+ charge) to book the flights I need with a reputable company/travel agent. My Bank does not take 5-7 business days to process a refund - Their ""Accounts Department"" is taking far to long to refund the money they stole.AVOID THEM LIKE THE PLAGUE"
"I do so hope that you get your money back into your account asap, and with a big apology for keeping you waiting., - not a good look from BYOjet."
"I made the mistake of not checking reviews before purchasing. Within an hour I had a sms and an email stating my booking could not be ticketed and I had two options:-<snip>OPTION 1: Confirm the same flights for an additional AUD60.00 per person exclude infant (upgrading to the next available fare)OPTION 2: Cancel this booking request and a refund request will be sent to our accounts department for processing. Please note this may take 5-7 business days to show in your account depending on your bank’s processing times.</snip>So yeah, needless to say, this bait and switch tactic is VERY common with BYOJet... now I've read all of the bad reviews about them. I of course opted for the refund, thei're not scaming me 1 cent. I payed through PayPal back to my Visa credit card. I'll log a problem with PayPal and report them to the ACCC in a couple of weeks if they haven't refunded the money. Such a scam and I thought I was a more careful than that!Edited: 4 years ago "
"I had a very bad experience with them. I have booked a return flight from m Sydney to Gold Coast, I have received the confirmation with the bookings etc. however, when I was in Gold Coast to get my return flight, I have found that this flight was not booked correctly even though I have received an email confirmation. I had to pay for a new ticket and so far I haven't been refunded! It's been more than 4 weeks!"
"So you never checked the details of your bookings on the airline website before travelling then, which is also where you should have made the booking?"
"Byojet took my booking for flights, debited $1500 from my account then 1 hour later emailed me to say that the booking could not be completed and that the accounting department would refund me in 5-7 days. There was no attempt to help find alternative flights or offer any other form of help. It just leaves me $1500 short for the next week and unable to book my flights with any other agency. Disgusting service!!!!"
"Hi Gambitdn, Refunds are generally processed immediately if the flights are unavailable when we attempt to ticket them for you. If we did not send you an option it may be because the next available fare was substantially higher. If we are able to assist with alternate flights please let us know, perhaps we can look at a different carrier or flexibility with dates? Please also confirm your BYO reference number & we would be happy to assist.Regards,The BYOjet Team"
"Do not use! Disgusting service! Deducted 20% more from my account than the website quoted, then cancelled my ticket 1 hour later with no reason given despite numerous phone calls. Had to wait 1 week for a refund as well as end up out of pocket for all the associated bank charges!"
20% more was deducted from my account than was quoted on the booking ticket! Refund was made with myself being made liable for all bank charges and left out of pocket! Do not use this company!!!!
"I forgot to check on TripAdvisor before I clicked the little button on Kayak that sent me to BYO Jet. Don't trust them with your personal details. I made the booking with them and then later received an email to say that my card had been charge but I would forfeit my seat if I didn't give them copies of my passport and credit cards. This email didn't include an invoice a booking number or anything that pertains to a airline booking. I don't have the facility to call an international number, but I got on to their chat line and was told that my card wouldn't have been charged yet because it's a weekend and that I can send an email to cancel my booking and won't be charged. I won't know if this is true or not for a few days but I have rebooked directly through the airline and that took half the time and is confirmed. If BYO does charge me I'll take it up with my credit cards company. I don't think Kayak should be affiliated with this company and I'm really disappointed that it's an Australian Company, apparently."

"<<even thou when I went directly to airline they give the flights with ease>> Yes, that is always the case and that is why here on TripAdvisor the recommendation is always to book directly with the airline for many reasons."
"Husband and I both just (stupidly) purchased tickets to London from Auckland but in separate transactions as one of them is a business trip that work will be refunding. His ticket went through ok. Mine did to start with until the inevitable email saying the booking was unsuccessful. He rang up customer services to cancel his ticket (as obviously we want to travel together) - on hold for ever, very rude staff and they are insisting on the $135 credit charge fee. I very much wish I had seen these reviews first as this was a stressful and terrible experience - NEVER AGAIN!!!"
I just booked two flights with BYOJet... I decided to trust them because they were an Australian company. Really should have checked here before I booked!
"BE WARNED. Do not deal with BYOJET.I booked and payed for a flight through them; I was travelling to China. First, they would not issue me with an E-Ticket receipt (they emailed an Itinerary only). Second they tried to tell me that you do not need an E-Ticket, that the Booking reference number is all you need. This is wrong! The Booking reference number depends on the GDS that the agent is booking the flight through; in my case the GDS was Amadeus, which is blocked in China. Also, the E-Ticket receipt is needed when applying for a China visa. Third, they completely messed up my name (my first name became my family name concatenated with my middle name!). Then they tried to charge me to correct it.Fourth, I had to cancel my flight (death in the family), seven days before departure. The ticket that I bought allowed for cancellations Cathay Pacific fee was $330. BYOJET took another $180"
They will take your money and offer you no help if situation changes.. Useless book with anyone else
"Skyscanner also use BYOJET, I went with cheapflights.com.au and thats how I got scammed with byojet THEY WERE HORRIBLE"
"I've just had a HORRIBLE experience with cheapflights.com.au/byojet they took my money even though the flights weren't available and I paid for 3 return flights!!! now I'm waiting for my money to be returned before I leave so I actually have some- absolutely shocking, shouldn't be legal"
"Please Avoid . SkyScanner should not deal with such companies! Booking and paying on their website doesn't mean they have booked your flight! I got a message saying the booking was successful but that was not the case! This is a misrepresentation as the booking is done at a later time and you have to wait for an email! Chat line service arrogant and unhelpful. Unsuccessfully tried their phone 3 times only to be put in a queue and cut off once you get to the head of the queue. Terrible, never again! Should have read the above posts beforehand!"
Their phone line keeps you looping for over and hour before hanging up on you - I need to make changes and their phone system hung up on me 3 times after 4.5 hours of holding all together (three calls). When i contacted them to for support they told me to email and wait... Three days later I got a response from a Moron named Matthew who sent added the costs up over a hundred dollars incorrectly (their faviur) and asked fo rthe dates i had emailed him three times. My flight is still wrong and I am still waiting for ANYTHING in response - I hope I can change my flight in 2 days - They are a very Evil organization - don't spend any money with them EVER!
You are 100 % correct there - they SUCK!
Dont trust them you can never get to contact them unreliable
Dont do it. They are a bunch of thieves. My mother has lost so much due to them
"PLEASE BEWAREIf you book your flights via BYOjet the booking confirmation does not specify what type of seat (food/baggage etc) you have booked nor will it give you the price of that flight and seat.YOU WILL GET:- Passenger details- Flight details- Grand total of the invoiceYOU WILL NOT GET:- The price of each flight- Details of the type of seat bookedThe confirmation does not specify if the booking is seat only or the works and including baggage. We apparently booked one flight with all inclusive and the other flight with no baggage. However, we have no proof on the booking confirmation of what type of seat was booked.TWO OPTIONS:1. After booking call customer service and confirm the type of seat booked. I had to wait 45mins on hold. 2. After booking call the airline directly to confirm the type booked. If you have a dispute. Good luck. Let's say a passenger books the correct flights. Yet the airline has different details. The passenger will only have paperwork to prove the passengers and flight booked. There is no proof of inclusions. They instead charge you the extras then you have to claim the money back from BYOjet. BYOjet have failed to acknowledge that they could possibly improve the customer experience by including a small but significant detail on their booking confirmation. It is because of this that I think customers should be made aware of the potential to not get the service they expect. They will point you to their terms and conditions but my point still stands. Upon receiving the book confirmation you need to confirm the seat type with either the airline or BYOjet. All other booking agencies provide this detail yet this company makes it the customers responsibility to re-confirm details that should already be in writing."
Just last night I booked a ticket to Melbourne behalf of my in laws. I was surprisingly waiting for their e- ticket but never got it. I rang them 1000 times but couldn't get hold of them. All I have realize is BYO is a complete scam and should be banned web site.
DO NOT BOOK WITH BYO JET!!!! I booked a simple flight between two major cities in Australia. They took my money and did not pass it onto the airlines. This meant that I had to buy new tickets when at the airport. Have had NO RESPONSE from them whatsoever. By far the worst booking agency I have ever used!!!!!!
"This is the worst service I have ever received. The only way to speak to them is by waiting on hold for at least an hour and they do not respond via email. Once I was even hung up on after being on hold for thirty minutes. I am supposed to fly to the US and they 'offer' a service to apply for an ESTA visa waiver. a month after applying through the BYOJET portal I have found that they haven't even submitted the application. Please do not book through them, I am most likely unable to attend a wedding in the states thanks to BYOJet's horrible service."
"OMG I wish I had looked here before I went anywhere near this company. Advice to anyone DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! I booked a trip to Thailand 5 days ago and received the standard email reply with fine print saying this was not a confirmation......Concerned that after 5 days I had nothing to confirm the booking I called their office and after 40 minutes on hold did online chat to be told they would check with bookings team. 10 minutes later I received an email saying the booking had been ""rejected"" and my card would not be charged - well thankyou for not charging me for a nil service. I have immediately rebooked with a reliable company, got an immediate confirmation but all at an additional AUD$300 (a 30% increase in the fares on offer 5 days ago). Can I say it clearer DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY - THEY ARE SHONKY!!"
Booked several flights in 2014 with BYOJET and never had a problem with them. It may have been that I never tried to cancel or change bookings and just waited til we got to the airport to check in. And the prices were cheaper than booking direct with the airline directly - Virgin (Perth to Singapore) and Malaysian Airlines (Singapore to Dubai.
.OMG! Why didn’t I read this yesterday? I already transferred $3045 to their account and still haven’t got the confirmation of my two tickets to booked to Stockholm and back. I have already written three emails asking them to confirm my booking. I still haven’t heard. I hope they will honour my booking
They were terrible. They kept over $500 after they altered the prices of the flight and asked me to either pay extra to keep the booking (fair enough as the airline had increased tickets) or cancel. I chose to cancel and more than a month later I am still trying to get my refund. Absolutely ridiculous.
"I processed the booking with byojet online and paid with my credit card. On completion of the transaction, the amount was debited from my credit card and I received confirmation of my booking as well as the itinerary and the terms and conditions.When I went to check-in at the airport I was informed that my ticket was cancelled. The airlines informed that they had received the payment and instructed byojet to issue the ticket but it was never done and they cancelled the ticket. I spent an hour on the phone with byojet and was told that I did not pay and that was the reason the ticket was cancelled. The money had cleared payment 2 days before the flight. I had to fly to South Africa due to an illness in the family, but the lady on the phone had no compassion and I was told that it was too late to issue the ticket and I had to book with the airline directly, while they had my money. I took me more than hour on the phone before they, all of a sudden, could issue the ticket. Having to deal with something like this before you fly out due to a mistake from byojet was absolutely unnecessary and totally unprofessional.Byojet is not a company I will trust ever again and I would advise everyone against using them. Rather pay a few dollars more and use a reputable company, with these guys you will be going nowhere."
"""In the event that the airline should impose a higher fare that was paid either before or after actual travel or any other reason whatsoever, including but not limited to, no show, you agree and authorize us to charge your credit card with the additional amount charged to us by the airline or provider, and not to dispute this charge with your bank. You understand that we act solely as agent for you with the airline and are not the travel provider. Any dispute you may have is between you and the airline, we will assist you with any such dispute to the best of our ability by providing all documentation relating to this booking we may have.""READ YOUR T&C'S PEOPLE!"
"if you need to change your flight - forget it , worst customer care service, stay away front them! they are terrible.!Edited: 4 years ago "
Donot use BYO jet!!!! they don't follow up. When yougo to check your booking they tell you you were unsuccessful and charge you a higher price .. Keep away from BYO JET
"Er...I thought that the byojet is an airline or something, now i know that it's an online Travel Agency, oh, i've never heard & used it.so, to those who complained here: Just admit the mistake and learn from it."
My credit card has just been debited by this company and i have never made a booking or even made an inquire with them. I have tried to contact them with no luck. I have raised this issue with my bank as i would like to know how byojet obtained my credit card details.
"worst booking agent in Australia. absolute criminals that should not be allowed to operate. you will get bad service, unexpected fees. no notification if flights change. no availability to upgrade flights. i'm a frequent flyer and have never experienced such frustration with a single company, they are as good as telstra."
"worst booking agency ever!!!!! save your time and money and deal with any other travel site in the world but this one. they are rude, have no consideration for people and their schedule. the fine print will make you come unstuck."
Avoid avoid avoid! Booked my family of 4 to go home over Christmas. Flights were cheap which was great. Recieved a email 5 hours later telling me due to a syncing the flights were not booked and I would neee to pay another $2500 to book new ones!!!The flights never exisited in the first place and was total false advertising! Thanks for ruining Christmas for my family BYO Jet!!
"I booked international trip with my two kids from Australia, firstly i got charged much more than advertised price (somewhat my mistake I should have looked at final figure and would not have given my credit card details). Secondly when i checked my itinerary my surname only got printed in half though my kids surname was printed ok. I contacted them immediately and got advised that i have to pay for new ticket and my old ticket will be refunded in 8-12 weeks plus i have to pay $205 (BYO charges) plus i have to pay Airline name change charge s on top of that. What a crap, there system for some reason only picked first 3 letters of my surname and I am getting penalised for this. I still have one month to fly so I am lodging this case with Fair trading.But please take my advise, pay little more with normal agents and avoid BYO"
"DO NOT USE BYOJET - ITS NOT WORTH IT My friend and I both used Skyscanner to both the same flights to the UK only I used byojet whereas he used Expedia, there was a mix up with the airline however Expedia honoured the price but BYOjet went missing never to be heard of again (in m case anyway)We now have two families going on a trip of a lifetime together but nw on different days and planes.Do yourself a favour and book by using Last Minute, Expedia or Wotif as they have customer service"
"Hi, I would not recommend BYO jet, i had a horrible experience with them. At best they have terrible customer service. At worst, they are a scam. I wanted to change my reservation, called them, and they said that I had to call back in an hour because someone with the UK codes would have to change my booking. It had no logic or reason to it, felt like they were waiting to jack up the price. Will never use them again."

"ADVICE PLEASEI have booked flights from UK to USA In (Dec 2016 for Aug 2017). I have received confirmation from ByoJet & used the Air France ref no provided to log into Air France to check my booking with them. So far my booking IS CONFIRMED with Air France & all passenger details are correct.i am hoping I will be one of the lucky few that has no problems & would love to hear from anyone else out there that has used them successfully, as I am now pancaking after reading all the terrible reviews.Edited: 3 years ago "
i have just made a booking with byo jet.co.uk and all is fine I was able to speak to customers services without a problem and all the flights are booked and confirmed on the airlines website great service would use again
"Sean S, have you actually travelled with them yet?"
"Word of warning. They may be cheap but as the saying goes ""good things arent nescessarily cheap and cheap things arent nescessarily good""!. Made a minor error in the booking and it took over a MONTH to get it corrected. Multiple phone calls, long waiting for the calls to be answered, multiple emails, many many emails unanswered. Different answers from different people in their call centers including some outright lies. Huge frustration. Id rather book direct with the airline and have my fate in my own hands!!!!!!!! Never never again with BYOjet"
"the website and phone message says there's a online chat service on the website, but I can't find it anywhere!!the phone call takes a long time to be picked up."
Do not use this company. Nothing but very bad service.
"I have now used BYO Jet for 2 years to go long haul AKL-LAX several times & LAX-Nairobi, also many internal USA flights. ..I have had good, reliable service at better prices than I could find even from the airlines themselves. I have been happy with their service."

"Why would you expect an OTA to reimburse you, for what were probably non-refundable tickets, when medical issues arose, which is the reason that travel insurance exists."
"Jaz, I recommend ot booking with any third party, but even if you book with the airline, a non refundable ticket usually means just that. Travel insurance is the best way to cover yourself against medical issues that will prevent travel. It's not really realistic to expect an agent to provide free insurance for you by refunding you money shoudl something unfortunate happen.I hope you get better soon. In future, my advice is to make sure that you have good travel insurance, and make sure that you also check the rules of the tickets you ar eplanning to buy very carefully."
"I think Roj meat to say ""I do NOT recommend. """
"I booked with BYOet to fly from UK to Wisconsin USA in Dec 2016, to fly Aug 2017. The price was almost half of the other airlines; in fact the cheapest I have EVER paid for this journey, which I have done several times!!!I received confirmation right away, (this was a very basic email, but all 5 passengers were correct & it had an Air France ref number on it). I checked my booking with Air France & this was also confirmed & correct.I had a few minor schedule changes, which BYOjet informed me of. However 4 months later I had one of my 3 flights cancelled. (This was NOT a fault of BYOjet but of the airline). Byojet offered me an alternative itinerary (at no extra cost & was very similar to my old itinerary, give or take 5-10 mins here & there!) but was subjecy to airline approval. After a panic phone call (which was very quick to get through, a kind woman assured me that my new schedule had been submitted for approval & they were waiting for the airline to response. A short while later I received my new itinerary and ref number & 2 separate emails making sure I received them. BYOjet have provided an excellent service so far!"

"ByojetI have this evening at 11pm ish UK time booked two flights with you, then realising that I needed to cancel these flights, so within 3 hours UK time I call to cancel them..... I thought all customers could cancel within 24 hours.... Anyway I was correct once I got through to your offices, I was told a small admin fee of $16.99 to cancel each ticket, then they realised I was in the UK and they were in the Phillipines and I was told that my 24 hours had actually expired as they go on their clock not mine and I can still cancel but will lose the entire cost of the flight!!!!!!...... I don't think your company is customer service based at all and all you want to do is rip good hard working people like myself off, where is your pride in being a company that operates like this. All you have done is to ensure that I will never book with you again and that I will just make sure that all my family and friends are aware of your crooked policy. Why the likes of good Airlines even allow you to sell tickets on their behalf is beyond me. Shame on youEdited: 3 years ago "
I would definitely not recommend ever using this company again!
"Booked a ticket through Byojet and the name that was in the itinary that was sent to me was wrong.Called them and they said that it was my mistake and said it would cost SGD 150 to amend the name. How could I possibly key in my name twice without knowing?! The sequence of the other passenger in the itinary was wrongly registered too!!The customer service rep then said I called and inform them too late as it was 4 days after the booking was done.I told them I sent them an email on the actual day after realising it was wrong! They went to check and realised I did sent and they did not reply!After looking through the itinary again, the airline booking reference number was wrong and the airline did not register that at all! Their system are flaw and they blame it on the customer. This is a fraud which I am going to pursue if they do not issue me a new ticket.It is atrocious making the customer pay for their own mistake.Would not ever recommend. Worse experience ever. Will be spreading the word of mouth"
I had the opposite experience and got an amazing deal on my overseas flights. everything was as promised. had trouble with one flight's delay but that was the airline's fault not BYOJET'S.
"Don't waste your time!! Advertised prices for flights do not exist. Have tried to book several long haul flights at prices they have quoted as being available, but when you try to book them the transaction fails as the quoted airline cannot confirm the seats/prices that have been quoted to you, or the price is significantly more."
"BYOjet This is the most horrible service I've ever met. I can not book extra luggage through BYOjet. I waited 22.06.17 for the answer of the operator for 30-40 minutes. The operator of Gavi is very rough. From Gigi's manager, I waited 22.06.17 for an answer of 30 minutes but she did not want to talk to me. I spent a lot of time and money. I now do not know who made this mistake your website or BYOjet. But as a result, I lose my money and time. I'm a customer why should I pay for a bad service?"
"I recently booked flights via BYOjet on line from Melbourne. 3 days later on checking my credit card statement, I was horrified to find a $4922 aud charge for the Nerissa Hotel in Turkey. This is a Fraudulent illegal charge. So much for Byojets claim of being a secure site. I did not even look at this hotel or any others . So travelers BEWARE the site is not secure. Any comment BYO ?"
"DO NOT BOOK WITH BYOJET: They have been unprofessional, not meeting expectations, giving fake timings, long procedures, waiting 30 minutes in the phone to be attended by an human person... After spoke with my bank as they said it was my problem, I sent all my identifications scanned, filled letter with ALL my details (even bank account details) to them, they said everything will be shorted within up to 4 hours and they took more than 14 hours to finally cancel my trip. I won't recommend you to anyone of my contacts ever."

"If you want to have checked luggage, you may not want to use this site. They do not tell you whether or not checked luggage is included and then you have to pay for it separately if it is not."
Have you had your flight yet?
"I booked with BYOjet tonight for a return flight Brisbane to Chennai in November. I though I had been extra careful but when I received my booking confirmation, I noticed the return date was 23rd, not the 25th. I had been deciding which date to choose so the error might well have been mine. I phoned the helpline immediately and only had to wait 6 mins before my call was answered. A nice guy called Dave was happy to change my return date at no cost and emailed me my new booking confirmation within 10mins. I often wonder about reviews. When people have a bad experience, they write a review. I applaud them for this. But when people have a good experience, most of them never take the time to say well done. So fingers crossed all goes well. If it doesn't, I will be sure to update this post. But in the meantime, well done Dave on great customer service."
"Omg, have just booked 2 ticket to Melbourne, booked through skyscanner and it ended up through byojet. Have got an itinary from them and log in details for their site which don't work. I have now just read these reviews and am rather worried, help, what should I do?????"
"I used skyscanner too and it came up with a list of prices for each website. BYOjet, Scoot, Aunt Betty, etc. I chose BYO because a previous search showed negative reviews for all the websites and Scoot, although the cheapest, seemed to be the worst. Are you able to reply to them on your itinary booking? If not, there is a UK number you can call (includes the country code from here in Australia +44 8081 891414) You will find it on their main contact page. Or email them at byojet@customercare.travel. Hope this helps."
"I booked my tickets through them on 16 Aug. I received my itinerary in 10 minutes time. I then rang the Airline directly, just to confirm, if everything is ok and guess what, they have all my details in their system and it was all good.So, I suggest if you have an itinerary, give airline a call to confirm.I also want to add that I booked international flights with BYOJet last year as well, everything was fine.Good Luck :)"
"Hi, thanks for getting back to me. I got in touch with Byojet, they have sent me etickets etc. Have also checked on Etihad airways, all is good, panic over!!!!"
They certainly don't have many fans on this site. Why would you use them instead of booking directly with the carrier?
Don't even consider them. Poor customer service and riddled with fine prints
"I feel like I got ripped off and scammed by BYOJet. Had to change my travel date so I gave them a call, little did I know their policy is so absurd. First, the fee is horrible expensive! Second,their customer service is so insensitive, so snappy. Being a travel agent they should know better to have a good customer service! To add to that they asked for my credit card digital copy (back and front) and I know too well that you are not meant to do that. Bear in mind I already provided them with all the details they need to charge my card for the change fee. Anyway, this is the first time I am booking with BYOJet and the last time. Never again! And I don't recommend to you guys to use them too. I dont want anyone to experience the same thing."
Can I ask who you used as I am in the same situation as you. Would appreciate your recommendation in regard to hotel booking s
This is the air travel forum. Why are you asking about hotel bookings?
Don't book with them. If any mistakes happens through the booking even if it is BYOjets fault they will charge you and extra fee to change it
Do not book through this company. They've just cancelled my cousin's flight and refused any refund due to a simple typing error. All this despite the air carrier beingnhappy to proceed with change (there wa as double r in Claire). The error was identified within 5 mins of booking but flight was only cancelled 3 weeks later despite instant notification. BYOjet are thieves.
My last 12 flights were booked wit BYOJET and I've not had a single issue with them at all
"Please, please DO NOT ever use BYO Jet.I recently purchased a ticket online and added baggage of 23kg at the time of booking for an additional $75NZD per bag. I took a photograph of the confirmation. I later recieved an email with my 'itenarary' which did not show a baggage allowance. I called BYO and their first representative hung up on me the second laughed when I explained the urgency of needing baggage and that I had already paid. They told me I had not purchased baggage and the only way to do so was at the airport at an additional cost of $140 per bag!!!!!! I called Virgin Australia who is the airline to book baggage over the phone, they told me it was a small aircraft and therefore they cannot add baggage over the phone. How can a third part be sold tickets from a company like Virgin Australia and then FRAUDULANLY advertise them with neither company claiming responsibility!!!!! BYO jet WILL take your money unlawfully DO NOT USE THEM!!!!"
"I have had three very successful trips over the last 18 months booked through BYOJET. In each case I got a better deal than was available through my airlines directly. And before booking my first trip, I did check out who they were and discovered that the business was now majority owned by Flight Centre, so I took some comfort in that: afr.com/technology/flight-centre-acquires-70…"
"""the business was now majority owned by Flight Centre""That would not give me any comfort."
"It would worry me, to be honest, not comfort me."
"Book through BYOJet if you have the intention to book your own flights again after that..I booked a ticket through BYO jet in early August this year. The first attempt did not went through due to some authentication code thing that I am required to key in during payment. I called them up and was finally advised to re-booked my air tickets after 2 hours of discussion. I confirmed it with them and took the 2nd attempt to booked my tickets. This time round it went through and I was happy to received a call to inform me that they will not be charging me for my 1st attempt. I even confirmed the details with them. Following which, I received a confirmation email from them with an itinerary. 3 months after, I wrote to them to inquire about my baggage allowance and was informed that they had cancelled my flight tickets. This was 4 days before my flight !! They insisted that my flight did not went through at all and the email was to inform me that the email was just a tax invoice and not a confirmation. In the first place, why did the word the email in the following manner and include the itinerary.

"Update: Flight from Brisbane to Chennai and back. No problems at all. Everything went smoothly so I guess am one of the thousands of happy BYO customers who take the time to post a positive review about this company. I will have no hesitation in using them again, even though I accept they do not always get it right. But then who does?"
"BYO Jet will blatantly lie to you. I strongly strongly suggest avoiding them. Speaking with the airline directly I could have had more including flexibility. BYO clearly run at a high profit as they charge for everything and essentially nothing. Lastminute or Skyscanner are both much better if you wish to book online. Last note, if you call them. Expect to be on hold for over an hour. Then once they speak to you they will say, ''I'll just put you on hold for 2 - 3 minutes and be right back''. Such means 15 - 20 minutes.Edited: 2 years ago "
No do not use them. I tried to change my rtn flight and they kept cutting me off which when meant waiting 30min again to get through each time.
"I have just been stuffed around by byojet. Telling me they cant book the flights I paid for. After being hung up on and on hold for 1 hr, I finally got through. They have assured me I will be reimbursed my money in full within 24 to 48hrs. After reading all the negative comments on here ill believe it when I see it.Do not book through byojet. I just got told of a site called momondo. Just wow. I found a flight which is cheaper, less travel time and more direct than the original flight I booked through byojet. Received my electronic ticket within 1 hr. Amazing, stress free and a must check out for all budget travellers."
Disgusting and terrible customer service!!! Would not book with them ever again.......
"What happened then, Gene? Can you share any details with us?"
I just booked this week a flight from Queenstown to Sydney. Took my credit card payment twice. BYOjet supposedly refunded one payment onto the credit card....but 6 days later still waiting. Told to speak to my bank. Not helpful. Terrible service. Stay away from this company.
"I first used BYOjet back in 2013 for a trip from Brussels to Prague without a single hitch so I decided to use BYOjet again yesterday to purchase tickets from SYD-BRU-SYD via Skyscanner. The entire booking, payment and ticketing process was seamless. ONLY the amount that was quoted and paid was taken from my credit card, with NO fees too, I might add. I'm super impressed with their prices too. We don't travel until December, 2018 and I'm not expecting any problems. Thus far I cannot fault their prices and service. Thank you to the BYOjet team."
"I took a gamble after reading all the bad reviews and my gamble paid off. I was very careful to check all the details and my personal information, paid by credit card for added insurance and I also checked with the CAA that they were ATOL protected. They are and they are also known as Flight Centre. Once I paid I received a booking reference and an email confirmation. I then checked the airline website which is Iberia and I put the booking reference and my flight reservation was all there. So my advice would be to make sure you input the correct details and recheck all is correct and then you won’t experience a problem. It was a great service and nothing to worry about after all. And I saved about £700 by not going through Iberia or BA."
Wow! I just booked a flight with them and found that they'd docked me an additional £47 even after they stated that there are no card charges. What have I let myself in for?
"This company is a disgrace, currently taking them to court for £1698 they took from my credit card. Very dishonest people."
"You must work for them as they are an awful company, just read all the reviews on the internet"
Avoid this company at all costs.They are not ATOL protected.I had to cancel my BA flight due to a sudden medical emergency and the customer service representative at BYO Flight said they could not help me. British Airways advised that if I had bought with them directly they would have been able to refund my ticket.They may be cheaper than buying direct with an airline but do not provide you any protection or customer service.Terrible AgentEdited: 2 years ago 
I wish i found this thread earlier. I just had a booking with them and they are a nightmare to deal with their fees are ridiculous. Any change no matter how minor it is will cost you money and excessively too. So stay clear of them.
"I would not recommend BYOJET. This is my experience. We had to cancel our trip to Dubai because of my girlfriend's father unexpectedly passing away 2 days before we were due to fly. We were due to fly with British Airways but booked through BYOjet. We called immediately to let them know we won't be able to fly and to release our seats. 3 months and numerous emails later I have finally given up trying to get a refund. Having called British Airways directly they were quite sympathetic and said they are not restricting a refund from their side and would have given me a refund if booked directly with them but BYOjet customer services only tells me they tried to contact the airline and who refuse to refund (and the airline denying this is the case). I can't say I've been impressed with their customer service and it seems my case has been going backwards and forwards with both sides bouncing me back to the other but ultimately it seems that as I booked and payed with BYOjet that they should have a policy in place to account for such situations (as British Airways does). This has been very distressing for us both and now we have lost a thousand pounds in addition to much time writing emails, sending death certificate and other documentation to both parties. My advice would not be to book through this agent but book through the airline directly. I certainly will not be using them again when booking my travel in the future."

"I’ve used BYOJet quite a bit and to date haven’t encountered any issues. If you plan to buy and fly without any amendments to your itinerary then you won’t have any issues. Their rebooking fees are egregious though, however once you have taken the first flight on your itinerary you can simply make any further alterations with the airline directly. I’ve done this a couple of times and found on both occasions the fee to change a flight is much less than dealing with BYOJet directly."
I certainly agree as I am having terrible trouble trying to get my money back after the airline the flight was with canceled the flight I was booked on.
"So this thread spooked me having booked 7 Florida flights for later this year!I called Virginatlantic to see if I had got any tickets with them and they confirmed all 7 tickets by name so, BYOjet can get it right and frankly, if they were that bad, I can't think they'd have survived all these years!"
"I thought that they were OK too, until Global Atlas (the airline) cancelled all flights between Copenhagen and Istanbul. As I couldn’t rebook immediately with an other airline (as the times didn’t suit and I wanted to be recheck what alternatives were available) they (BYOjet) started the crediting back process which is when my problems began, putting all sorts of hurdles in place, simply because the original credit card that I used had to be canceled because of attempted fraud by a third party. I think that I have some resolution in place now, but until the money arrives back in my bank account I can’t be sure. They then clearly stated that the process could take 12 weeks. Is that good business practice? I don’t think so."
Do not trust themJust made a booking with themI just need to make a change in my last name and they are charging me 200 dollarsBetter direct with the airline
"I’d recommend you don’t use them. You will book a ticket, they will not make it clear what the fees for change in your booking are, just their extra fees and you will pay 40% of the ticket price just to fly a day earlier."
my sincere advice is for you not to use them. They have poor customer service.
Don’t do it. They are utterly useless!
Very bad experience
Right . Terrible Byojet
Terrible. Book directly with flight
Byojet $140 extra for change or cancel the international flight if you change your mind. Buy directly from Airline
"I should have read other website reviews before i booked through this website. The website didnt allow me to pay through card or paypal. So i had to through Bpay. Its now 6th day. They still didnt issue my tickets. I kept on calling them. Their excuse is my money didnt go through, even though booking is confirmed. They said if the flight amount change then i have to pay more as well. If they refund even it will take another week and i cant book another flight also. Im in a total mess just because this scam website.Now i have to wait for ages for them to pick up my call. Do not book from this website."
"You would have read some of my earlier postings whereby “the airline” canceled all the flights between Copenhagen and Istanbul! Therefore byojet advised that it could take up to six weeks to get my money back, which I found unbelievable as it was no fault of mine or even byojet!Anyway after approximately 8-10 weeks I saw that my money has been refunded, even though I have had to, in the meantime book and pay for new tickets.... this time directly with another airline. All in all it has ended well. If it all goes well with byojet, then I am sure that they are ok, but if there are problems, expect the unexpected!"
"No. They have the worse costumer service. I booked some tickets with them and this booking was in progress for almost 60 hours. I contacted them by at least 10 emails, messenger and phone calls in which I waited for more than 3 hours and no-one answered. Finally the told me the booking was unsuccessful but they never told me. Don't waste your time!"
"DONT DO IT! I am currently stuck in Cambodia looking for other flights out - a very costly experience with BYO Jet! I arrived at airport to catch my flight to Singapore for a connecting flight to Australia - and was refused as the returning flights that I paid in full... and received multiple emails re my ""itinerary "" had the ticket printed.... but was 'not in the system"" and the flights / had not been booked!!!The reference number got me here with no problems but somehow didn't work on my return flights...I was unable to contact them after 5 hours of trying and they have not responded to my emails.... I am hoping I can get a refund and have kept all relevant emails and information.... Unbelievable bad experience!!"
"Actually, despite the bad press I'm reading here, I've used them 2ce over the last year to fly to the US and had no problems with them. I guess as with some of these cheap places, they're a bit mixed. All I can say is I've been happy with them."
"Contrary to the other posters, I’ve had 3 positive experiences with BYOJet. Just returned from a trip to London flying China Airlines Business Class (wonderful) for under $4000.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Be very cautious when using BYOjet. I have been in correspondence with them since February this year after I paid £777 for two tickets LHR to JFK which never arrived (my departure date has now passed).The last communication was a call to them in May when I was promised a call back ""within 48 hours"". I'm still waiting. Things go wrong - that's life - it's how customer services deal with issues that companies are judged by. BYOjet's post sales care is dreadful. I'm in the process of pursuing a claim through my credit card company.I will always deal direct with the airline when buying tickets in future."
"Wish I had read these reviews before booking my flight. Found reasonable priced tickets via Skyscanner. Once I purchased the flights, I was then informed that no baggage was included on a long haul flight! There was no indication of this, or option to include baggage when booking. Thought this was a mistake and emailed for clarification, but got no response. Finally called up and was told that I had to wait till online check in to buy extra baggage each way, which has substantially increased the cost of the tickets. Also told that the tickets are not refundable now that the 24hour window as passed. But they did not respond to my email which was sent within 24 hours!"
Do not touch this company. If you have a problem you can not get in touch with them. I am trying to change dates and they won't get back to me . Email or phone.
"Made a terrible mistake and bought tickets through BYOJet in UK. I needed to change one flight, and in spite of sending an email, filling in the request form on their website and spending an hour on hold on an expensive international call which they never answered, there was absolutely no response. I ended up having to buy a one-way flight back to UK from Osaka. BYOJet is not a travel agency, they are simply making their money out of the airlines and not passing on any kind of service to their customers. I will be following up with a investigative journalism TV program. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!"
The ticket purchase was ok. However I made a spelling mistake and their customer service is dreadful. They charged £55 to alter one letter. (The airline charged nothing). They take 20 minutes to answer the telephone and don’t reply to emails! I wouldn’t recommend them.
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY WITH BYO JET. The most unbelievebaly terrible 'Travel Agency'. I booked a trip from Perth, Australia to Auckland, Wellington. When you book with BYO Jet, you book ONLY a seat. You are not told ANYWHERE that a bag is not included. Not at any time are you asked if you want to include a bag. So, you will be stung, like me and my baby, for 100s of dollars at check in. Easy booking online, but of course, this is probably so you will overlook the fact you are not getting to take a bag.When I rang to ask, the gentleman, working for BYO Jet, told me 'they' are not able to book people's bags on flights? He told me the offer cheap seats ONLY. There REALLY needs to be clearer warning on your website about this, so you stop scamming people out of money - and infuriating customers. I asked for some money compensation from the gentleman on the phone. He told me I could have my $10 credit card transaction back, but then hung up on me - leaving me high and dry at the airport. SO RUDE, SO UNPROFFESIONAL, SO UNBELIEVABLE! I am now having to pay an EXTRA $230 to take my bag to and from New Zealand"
"I have read so many bad reviews about this company since I booked my flight to Tampa back in May. Feeling very unsettled I rang KLM to check if my flight was booked, yes it was no worries there. Second leg was Amsterdam to Atlanta, major problem with aircraft, emergency landing in Newfoundland missed connecting flight to Tampa etc etc. I requested compensation, BYOJET were great in helping me to do this procedure. I would use this company again and would recommend to others. In fairness to the company and to passengers who were let down, I have wondered if they have now got their act together and upped their game. My experience was excellent and a really good price"
"Great can you please supply the number you called in Christchurch would love to get some help with my booking, desperate."
yes Used them last year andmy credit card was ripped off for almost 5000$ in turkish lire.Not a safe site.
"An update to my reply posted on 24 July 2018.Following my post, BYOjet contacted me and has refunded my tickets in full."
"BYOjet cost me $3000.I booked a return flight from Perth to San Francisco.Prior to departure my wife became sick.We had a Doctor's certificate stating she was unfit to travel.I contacted BYOjet proir to departing on the first leg of our journey.We were to fly with China Southern Airlines.I discussed with BYOjet my options.I said I would fly with another airline as the dates available with China Southern were not convenient.I was clearly informed by the BYOjet agent that I would be able to use the return segment of my booking.I checked with Amadeus several times and my booking for the first section showed as ""cancelled"" the return segment always showed as ""confirmed"".Imagine my horror when I went to check in for the midnight flight at San Francisco Airport and was told by China Southern ""we are unable to process your ticket."" The reason was that we did not complete the first part of our journey with China Southern.At no time was I told that the return segment of our tickets would not be valid.I had to pay Au$3000 immediately at the China Southern check in.To add insult to injury we were allocated the same seats as we had reserved as our names were still showing as per the original booking.I have written to BYOjet, so far my emails have been ignored. I have tried numerous times to telephone and each time my calls time out.BYOjet gave me false information that cost me AU$3000 and as my booking agent BYOjet has an obligation to me to refund my money. I am awaiting a positive response from them."
"""I was clearly informed by the BYOjet agent that I would be able to use the return segment of my booking.""---If that was the case then you you misinformed by the BYOjet agent."
Yes. Exactly my point.
"I booked first class flights from London to Tokyo with Byojet for business after reading first class reviews about them on Skyscanner. The cost was GBP4500, just around £80 cheaper than direct with BA. This was a false economy. As I need to cancel the trip a few weeks later, and BYOJET informed me that they would deduct GBP655 from the original flight ticket and that a refund would take up to 12 weeks. So I have been paying interest on GBP4500 since 15th May and have been expecting a refund since 11th of June of around GBP3770, but still no refund. I tried to remain patient but I am now very worried that I will not receive the refund!! I think Skyscanner should stop allowing them to advertise also. If I do manage to get my refund I will let you know ...but proceed with extreme caution."

"terrible service once you have booked your ticket online,i have tried calling several times but never manage to speak to customer service, they dont reply to email either"
"I am currently in dispute with BYOJet. I booked flights last Wednesday at 5.20pm. I tried to cancel them at 9.00am the following day. They will not cancel or answer my emails. After some research I found that they are a subsidiary of Flight Centre UK. They use the same UK company number 02937210. However, customer care staff in the UK are not interested in helping me. Today I have emailed the MD of Flight Centre UK chris.galanty@flightcentre.co.uk to ask him for some help. Others with issues may want to do the same"
"Do not under any circumstances use this outfit. I am sure they offer cheap prices, but a lack of customer services more that offset any potential saving. I had to cancel a flight booked through them. It took 3 weeks for them to respond to a number of emails and then they tried to tell me it would take 12 weeks to get a refund. I didnt expect them to have to chisel the refund from under a glacier!Judging by this tread, they do not seem to either listen or seek to improve. Avoid them and book direct through an airline"
Did the issue get sorted out ?
Did it help to send an email to the MD ?
"AVOID using them. I've read several reviews about byojet from disgruntled customers, unfortunately, after making my booking. Last evening, I booked 3 Sydney Delhi return tickets, for travel in Feb 2019. The booking email showed a return date of 15 March, while we want to come back on 15 Feb. This morning, when I read the email showing the itinerary, I asked for change of date within 24 hours. Byojet is asking for AU$500 per person for change of date, while I am getting a new ticket for same dates, with good connections for AU$749pp. When I requested cancellation of ticket, they said, there's no refund. They have also refused to show me their IT log (where I keyed in the dates of travel), claiming it is confidential. If it is my record and they claim I have written the wrong date, then why can't they let me see it.

Read my post #220. They are the trading arm of Flight Centre UK.
Yes. A full refund
"Scammer!! After i took all the time to put in all our details and credit card details and pressed confirmed, message appears ""PRICE IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE""WASTE OF TIME"
"The price probably hadn't been available for quite a while...You're right. The vast majority of these booking sites are a complete waste of time. Give them a miss, and book directly with the airlines. Despite what you might think, you won't pay more in the end."
I do not racomand BYOJET to any one I book a trip on the 5 of October and i cancelled on the same day there charge me $90.00 cancellation fee and I wait 3 and half week for the refund wen they said I should get the money in back beetwin 3 to 5 working days back in to my account
"Booked a flight 5 days ago with byojet to South Africa for a freind and was waiting for the itinerary which I was told would be emailed within 24hrs. After reading comments on here, I'm now extremely worried and not sure what I should do next. Do I cancel.? Do I wait to see if I get response. ? My friend is elderly and disabled and flying by herself. She would not cope if any problems with the journey on the day."
All is good until something goes wrong and you need to alter your original booking.Hopefully your etickets have arrived by now.
Book with airlineI booked with them on 20 nov 2018 there computer went opps something went wrong start again so I started again 10 mins later they took t wo lots off money out off my accountGot on to them straight away no reply Talk to airline direct said agent cancelled booking on 28 novBYOjet have said it could take 12 weeks for refund when it was there faultWill not tell why they took 8 days to inform airline
"They’re not! I have booked with BYOJET and had to cancel my flight within a week after booking. 1. They don’t mention anything on their website about the refund process timing which according to their sales people who take ages to answer the phone, takes 12 weeks to happen!!! 2. When booking I asked about the rescheduling and cancellation fees and they assured me that I won’t pay extra or loose money if I cancel up to 72 hours before departure, which what I did! I made sure I cancel earlier because I knew there was a chance I would have to, and then they charged me around 500 Dirhams for unclear reasons! 3. Honestly, going through this mess for a cheaper service is just not worth it! I ended up booking with Emirates directly which was I should’ve done in the first place."
"I totally agree! They are the most unprofessional business model!My flight got changed two weeks before the travelling date. The option they gave me was just ridiculous,12 hours transit. DON'T EVEN CONSIDER BOOKING WITH BYO JET!!I thing they should close their business."
"BYOjet, is fraud they have no physical office in the UK, if you have issue you have no face to the name.I am having issues and will have to end up suing BA for my money.Avoid BYOjet"
"AVOID at all costs, take my advice. I was left almost stranded. The customer service is awful and they try to blame the airline. AVOID"
Agree with ALL above - do not book through BYO jet
"wanna buy 11 tickets for ME, but having read awful reviews about this company , i have changed my mind. thanks guy"
"They are really Bad! I booked returning tickets from Auckland to Nanjing ( China), however on the way back when im about to catching the flight from Nanjing to Shanghai ( transit flight ) ive been told my flight number is not exist !!!! what they sold me is the Train ticket from Nanjing to Shanghai !!! but on my Iternery, it print China eastern airline mu3076 departure Nanjing to Shanghai !!!Ive made 3 calls to complain, they don't care at all !! the customer services staff said will report to the manager and someone will contact with me asap, but they never did !!"
"""China eastern airline mu3076"" Actually MU3076 is the flight from Shenzen to Wuxi.https:/…flight-mu3076-china-eastern-airlines"
What is wrong with your website?? Is it a scam? I get to the final stage and then won't send verification code what's the go?
"Booked a trip to Las vegas from AKL through byojet, recieved a flight change from airline changing flight to leave 3 days later, not acceptable, cancelled flight, They are waiting to confirm cancellation through Alaska Airline whom dont seem to be available on the phone or email, for the last 3 weeks, and Im told it may take up to 12 weeks, 12 weeks to get a response, what a surprise, Poor poor service would not use BYOjet or Alaska airlines ever"
This has nothing to do with Alaska Airlines - your booking is through a third party. Alaska Airlines are one of the best US carriers and would have phones manned 24/7.
Savita - you should have booked directly on the Air NZ web page. It is very easy to book AKL to almost any city in the USA with one ticket. Stop using these useless third party idiots and book directly with the airline.
dreadful service..have paid an extra $240 for name change for a Thai airways flight and still not received ticket. Keep getting fobbed off and being told 72 hours. Very angry as I have my brothers wedding to attend in less than a week. Keep assuring me I will get my ticket but each time I ring it is still being processed .. starting to panic now..would never ever recommend them
"I've read through a number of posts here (typically from one post wonders), and just wanted to share my experience so far with https://byojet.com/ I had serious concerns about booking with this website, given the multitude of negative reviews and mentions of additional costs at a later date. It worried me enough that I read the terms and conditions very carefully, and also called the phone number to clarify that the price I was seeing on the screen (in addition to the applicable booking fee) would be all I needed to pay. I was quite worried too because this was one of only two websites (the other being Aunt Betty) that was offering the low price they were, and with the additional $30 discount, this made it hard to beat. Basically, instead of paying the same price for a flight that would have to go via another city (but with a reputable agent), I could go direct, so, I struggled with the decision in case BYOJet lived up to its terrible reputation! However, I just took the plunge and hoped for the best!I made the booking and pretty much immediately received the invoice, BUT no flight itinerary. There was a note saying this would arrive within the next few hours, but on the itinerary itself, it said it would be issued within 24 hours. I will admit this was of concern to me, since I am usually issued an itinerary virtually immediately. However, I decided to give it a few hours.After around 3 hours, I had still received nothing, so just decided to call to get an update. The lady on the phone explained their system had gone down, so they couldn't issue anything. This actually caused alarm bells to ring, as I thought this might be the sign of bad news to come. However, she said she would make contact, as soon as the system came up. Within 1.5 hours, I received the itinerary + also received a call from the lady advising she had re-sent my flight itinerary. I quickly jumped onto the airline's website using the reference number, and confirmed that it was actually in their system, so this was great news!I have yet to actually take the flight itself (and have checked every so often, particularly after the payment finally cleared - just to ensure nothing had changed!), but so far, despite a few potentially downhill signs, it actually worked out.So, unless I turn up at the airport to find that my flight has mysteriously cancelled itself, then, unlike the others, I can say I've had an okay experience so far. However, my situation has been straight forward - Knew exactly what dates and what time I wanted, plus also I double-checked all my details extremely carefully (spelling of name, DOB, etc.), and have no plans to change. It's exactly these flight changes that seem to cause the most problems, but fortunately, I won't be changing mine!"
"Keep an eye on your booking, keep your fingers crossed, and let us know how it all turned out after you've flown."
"Will definitely give an update after I'm back! It is with a reputable airline, so, fingers crossed for a good result! :)"
please dont make the biggest mistake of your life
"gary, I think we might need a few more details! I really wish more than one post wonders would share their experiences! :)"
"I would strongly suggest you avoid this company. Numerous failures to issue promised emails, including itinerary, and eventually told me to deal direct with airline. Found many mistakes on our booking information which I am still trying to correct. Very unprofessional company."
"I would strongly suggest you avoid this company. Numerous failures to issue promised calls from management, including itinerary, and hang ups while on hold.Customer service is unprofessional, will hang up on you and will not phone you back.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Agree with all the comments below - stay away from that company. Failures , Liars & Incompetence - they take your money and then leave you hanging dry in the air ...so to say ... Never again"
"Avoid avoid avoid. My husband recently died suddenly and I had to cancel our flights. This company continued to address me in my husband’s name, lost emails with our marriage certificate and his death certificate attached. I have had to continually phone them, been given lots of different stories about the terms of my refund and still they email me asking for my husband and saying have a great day and thank you for booking with us. Sheer incompetence and lack of customer care. I get the feeling that the staff turnaround very quickly so don’t care about the feedback. It’s also quite telling nowadays when you call a firm and they don’t say that calls may be monitored for quality and training purposes!,"
"I'm very sorry for your loss. However, the service from byojet seems pretty standard as far as third party booking sites go. It ranges from decent to downright abysmal overall, but byojet look as if they are at the lower end of the scale."
"Just looked on Skyskanner and BYOJet showed return flights to Bali in December for $214 pp - I went on to live chat and was quoted $775 pp, I told them they are scammers and strangely enough they dropped out of the Live Chat LOL!"
"Hey there, can you shed some light on what happened?"
"Do not use BYOjets. I booked through BYOjet and had to change the date of my flight. I requested to change my booking. They demanded that I pay taxes, charges, fare difference and an automatic fee of £98. In total this would cost more than a new ticket (in all circumstances), so I asked for a refund and they refused. Customer care is on a carousel, every time I emailed back, a different person responded; Angel, Nicko, Katheryn, Ivs, Camille, Cedric, Lee; non of them were helpful; all of them were patronising and insincerely polite. Their bottom line is summed up in the final email I received, ""There is no human intervention when you made the booking, whatever you input that will be the information capture by the system. And before you proceed with the payment there is a check box that you agree with the terms & conditions [...] The penalties quoted is as per ticket policy"". Whatever your circumstances, this agency will follow the terms and conditions without question. So my next question is: How can the person responsible for this company's ticket policy be investigated and charged in a criminal court? Because they just stole my money, stole my holiday and gave me nothing in return.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Do not use BYOJet, it is a scam. They will mispell your name on the ticket and will ask you a fee to correct it, they will also book you on a flight where they are no seats available. They operate via a call centre so you never talk to the same person and each time you get a different version. In addition, they are rude and aggressive over the phone and speak over you. I have had nothing but troubles with them."
"Cassnu, I don't think it's necessarily a scam (well, I certainly hope not, since I've booked tickets through them!). I think you just get quoteD different prices when dealing directly vs booking online yourself.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Is it a scam? NO.Is it legal? Yes.Does it break airline rules? Yes.Are there risks? Yes, massive. Worst case, airline cancels your ticket.Would I ever consider taking such a risk? No.Read under ""Top questions about Air Travel"" on your right ""Beware of cheap business class tickets (sold by 3rd parties)""."
"In contrast to majority of these reviews, I want to share my experience with BYOjet - a positive one.Yesterday I booked a flight from Perth to Bangkok with them for me and my wife.There were actually 2 separate bookings because we are returning on different days.I admit, their website is very basic, you can't do much there, but I sent a general note through the contact form.I needed the airline booking number so we can get our seats together.I was contacted today by email and was told that our separate tickets were already linked into the same booking and I got confirmation emails for both bookings with the airline booking number (PNR).On top of that, I also got SMS from them that emails were sent.I'm not sure if I used them before, probably I did, I fly a lot.But I must say, I'm happy with the communication and how they responded."
"As RojBlake suggested, I just wanted to confirm my experience, now that I've been and gone. I booked tickets with Singapore Airlines via BYOJet. The primary reason being the price for going direct was the same as going via another city (but with a reputable agent), hence, I decided to try my luck. I had no issues on either flights. With the first flight, I was on standby, so they did not allocate me a seat at check-in. It turns out this was no issue, as I got a boarding pass soon after arriving at the gate with my seat number (and quite a good seat, I might add!). The return flight was also no issues! Also ended up with a good seat (aisle seat in middle section with an empty seat beside me). So, would I book it again with BYOJet? Yes, I would, but I was extremely careful when I made the booking! I checked every single detail repeatedly to ensure there were no errors, and everything worked out!Despite the one post wonders, I can confirm my experience was good!"
"Just sharing my experience with them. Found this thread while searching to see if BYOJet is reliable.I booked a flight with them from AKL to KUL with Qantas for this 16th of July 2019. I saw mixed comment on them but they were $100 cheaper than other sites + the $30 off, although there is a $20 booking fee at the end but still cheaper. I was very paranoid that I actually video myself and the screen while typing my details in case they blame me for typing the wrong details, etc.... and I'll have proof. Long story short, I got a Booking Confirmation, followed by an Itinerary 11mins later which I checked straight away and it was all good. Have to flown yet but will post an update when I'm back. Otherwise my experience with them has been good so far."
"Hi There,Are you able to provide me with the contact number you called on?I have booked with the site this morning and haven't received my itinerary yet and after reading some reviews am concerned."
Did you try this number: https://byojet.com/contact-usThey are part of Flight Centre Travel Group. You could otherwise try to contact them via Flight Centre.
Horrible! worst I've ever used!

"The Customer Service of this company is one of the WORST I've ever dealt with. I've been trying to book an Overseas Holiday for my Family for the Past 3 Hours, Every Time I enter the 6 digit code from my bank to Authorise Payment, the site crashes. I now can't book the flights I want, because their system says those seats are under booking process, but I can't access any of the bookings to finish the process. The Incompetent Staff on the Call Centre can't or Won't do anything, they merely tell you to go back and try again. The Managers won't speak to you, so the call centre staff are left to make some BS excuse up as to why NO ONE Will Help. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY WITH THIS COMPANY"
"Buy your ticket directly from the airline. There is no air fare fairy.If they have not taken your money, be happy."
"guys u might have a problem with byojet and saying they have the worst customer service, actually this is the best one for online travel agency, when they said they will come back to me they actually came, so i booked my ticket from sydney to santiago, santiago - melbourne - sydney but my connecting flight from melbourne to sydney got cancelled, and i called the customer service which is really helpful, and they replaced my canceled flight to direct flight from santiago to sydney, and also, they solved the problem about the SEAT i have purchase, for online agency this kinda service is great."
DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM. They are con artists. They sell you flights by providing misleading information.
"Oh god keep away from these online cheats.We bought a ticket and paid for it in October. After six weeks the want to change the flight schedules quoting airline conditions which was not shown before the ticket was sold to us. !!When asked for refund, we are told PENALTY will apply !!Run away from these cheats including Oman Air"
I am victim too
"imhH,Yes, you are a victim of your own stupidity for not reading the T&C's which would easily be locatable on the website if you had bothered to look."
"Cheap and easy online and never had an issue until i need to change my flight date (on an open ticket)My review online: Rang BYO from Korea and told them we wanted to change our dates to fly back, it was one day after the original date. (1 day) we have flown to Korea multiple times and always on an open ticket because we always change dates, depending on family situations. We only called BYO because this was the first time we used them. The person on the line told us that we would need to pay a fee, this was strange because it's never happened before. When we asked for a reason why, he couldn't give me a proper response. So to change the flight it was $275 for an adult and $690 for a child, that is insane!! So after speaking with Korean air, they informed me that there is no reason why anyone can charge more, because the flights were the same price and they can do it for us. They went on further and stated, once you have bought the tickets they own the ticket and you don't need to go through the agency anymore especially if there is no price change. Korean air were so polite and explained everything to us, absolutely everything. The member from BYO just stated that to change flight dates you must pay, the Korean air rep, was shocked and couldn't understand this...They are cheaper but just remember, fees and charges..... hope this helps"
"RJ.. Thanks for the warning. Byojet terms (UK) state ""Booking Terms and ConditionsBOOKING CONDITIONSPlease read these Booking Conditions carefully. You must not make any booking unless you understand and agree with these Booking Conditions. You should save and/or print a copy of these Booking Conditions at the time the booking is placed...""I assume you read and understood them.Edited: 12:44 am, January 31, 2020 "
"As to fees relating to the customer requesting a change or cancellation... ""You will be asked to pay a processing fee of £55 per passenger per booking (or such other amount specified in your travel documents), plus any additional travel service provider change or cancellation fees. Where we incur any liability for a travel service provider change or cancellation fee for any booking which you change, you agree to compensate us for the amount of that fee. You should be aware that costs could increase closer to the departure date...""I suspect many customers don't read the boring stuff, but it is this boring stuff that comes into play when you want to change your original booking request or the operating airline has an IRROPS."
Have you contacted Consumers Affairs
Never Book with them. They are Robbers
"Can only echo what most have already said.Cathay Pacific are offering FREE refunds to our flight destinations next month - Korea and Taiwan.BYOJet on the other hand are going to charge $250 PER PERSON to cancel.Making money out of a epidemic, very ethical!Edited: 4:30 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"Update -IF the Airline you are flying with is offering a free refund for flights (in our case for both Taiwan and Korea), BYOJet does not enforce the $250 per person cancellation fee and you will recieve a FULL refund.It did take about 40 mins to get an answer on the phone, but Jan at BYOJet was extremely helpful."
Do not use BYO Jet they are impossible to contact and never respond to emails. They often have a cheaper price upfront but are terrible to deal with after that. Avoid this online agency.
Do not using they are absolutely useless and no one answering phone and one to talk to you see yourself the reviews on Facebook or trust pilot again don’t Dont don’t
"My husband has a return ticket with qantas booked through byojet,which has been cancelled. He currently has no way to get back to Australia. He just wants to get home NOW! But they wont talk to him until 48 hours before his flight. AND they charged him $1000 to change 2 tickets as his brother's funeral in the UK was delayed due to Covid 19.What a DREADFUL companyDO NOT EVER USE THEM"
"You are awful. You have price gouged him on the flight change and now are not offering ANY form of service. He would like to get back to Australia, as that is what he has paid you for!"
"I have not had this experience. We have so far called BYOjet 3 times, to be told the same story, we have to $250 per ticket to cancel, even though Qantas is refunding canceled tickets...byojet will not follow through with the policy. very frustrating"
"How did you manage to get anything out of them? They refuse to respond to messages, and do not pick up their phones. Emirates won't speak with me as I booked through BYO Jet. Can't see how I will be getting my money back from them. Even a credit voucher is looking impossible."
All my flights are cancelled and BYOJet is completely offline and can't be contacted. Even their facebook messager is turned off and emails bounce back. I fear they might have gone bust. My only hope is my credit card
"Crooks. Airline has already refunded them (was told that by airline) but BYOJET won't refund me. They take $350 as a cancellation fee when the airline charges $0. Even holding a credit with the airline results in a ""nominal"" BYOJET charge of $55 when the airline charges nothing. Disgusting that they would use a situation where people are losing their lives to make money. When this is over, make them pay by avoiding them. they're often a little cheaper but they should be held to account for their lowlife behaviour."
"Marc: I'm sorry this happened to you, but this thread has been here for 7 of the 9 years you've been a member of TripAdvisor warning you away from using them.Online Ticket Agencies make their money in fees. You agreed to these fees when you clicked ""I agree to the Terms and Conditions"". I expect you didn't read them, none of us do, but by checking that box you accepted their cancellation and other fees.Book direct next time."
"You're correct, it has been there and I didn't look it up prior to booking. My fault I guess, along with thousands of others who rely on ""normal"" behaviour from companies without reading the small print. The old phrase that ""if something looks too good to be true, it usually is"" springs to mind but, T&C's aside, I bet 99% of people would think that charging $350 for a cancellation in these circumstances and for which they have been charged nothing by the airline is tantamount to taking advantage of the situation. Had they explained that, in order to survive, they need to charge c. $50 per booking to cover admin/staff costs, my guess is that people would understand and willingly agree. I genuinely hope they go bust after this as they are morally bankrupt already."
"Totally agree. But in good times this is a crap company. Under these conditions I'd be surprised if they don't declare bankruptcy. Those fees are the only things keeping them afloat, there isn't any other revenue"
"I hate BYO jet, what a load of robbers. I am going to try and claim via my credit card, hopefully this will help. Will also use any means of social media possible to shame them"
"The airlines(Thai) are being responsible and charging no fees for extension or vouchers, but these guys(byojet) are charging us for coronavirus outbreak extension and vouchers, refunds and so on.If that's how they are going to respond to the global pandemic, they have my negative feedbacks and responses to everyone that I know for the rest of my life.NEVER TRAVELING VIA HERE EVER AGAIN."
"Did you agree to their Terms and Conditions when you used them, Jimmy?That is how they make their money. Fees. Not by selling tickets at cost."
"""You're correct, it has been there and I didn't look it up prior to booking. My fault I guess, along with thousands of others who rely on ""normal"" behaviour from companies without reading the small print. """"normal behaviour"" for online travel agents is to charge fees for what they do - booking flights, changing tickets, processing refunds. This is not just byojet, but ALL of them. Trying to save money using OTA's is basically saying that you are willing to take on a higher level of risk should something go wrong. Most of them are quite up-front about the fees they charge and it is VERY VERY important to understand that before buying anything from them.As far as I know, Travel Agents are not considered essential businesses by most governments, so therefore they will be shut down right now. For those that have not gone out of business completely, there are going to be substantial delays and many, many frustrated customers, I'm afraid.Will people learn from this? You hope so, but I am guessing that once things open up again, people are going to happily spend money at shonky companies like this in an attempt to save some money."
Jimmy - you can avoid third party service fees by booking directly with the airlineThe problem seems to be that many people only consider the advertised price of the ticket and don't think the fees apply unless they are the one cancelling - the work to process the refund etc still needs to be done by the staff and the staff still need to be paidHow much did you think you were saving by choosing to use a third party rather than the airline direct? often it is only a few $ which is offset against limited customer service and additional fees
"Do not buy any tickets with BYOJet. The worst service and Untrustworthy company. My flight had cancel during Covid19, I asked for a full refund but they won't give me. they want to charge me around 260AUD. Airline won't charge during Covid19 but this BYOJet want to charge. it is so unfair, It is not our choice to fly but we could not fly as the country closed their border. Please read other people review. Lots of us have the same problem with this unfair trading BYOJet company. I am still trying to get my money back but still nothing."
"Hey, Sue. Guess what? That is the fee that you agreed to pay when your accepted the terms and conditions of BYOJet."
"This is COVID19 situation, My flight had cancel not my choice to make, Even all the airline gave full refund as so as other travel agents. Your People BYOJET doing Untrustworthy business. Cheated to your clients and take advantage during this Sadness COVID19. Other people are innocent, got job lost and having difficulty financial situation. Shame on you, No moral in your people. Your company so deserve bankruptcy."
"No-one here works for or represents BYOJet, Sue. I am just a normal user of TA like yourself. Well, actually not like yourself, because I understand what has happened to you, and you do not."
"You understand what happened to me? and you still saying fair? lots and lots of consumer are complaining about this unfair trading. I already reported to ACCC and unfair trading department. The law in Australia is fair for everyone. I trusted. If the law saying that consumer need to pay the fee during Covid19, I am happy to follow the law. I only what it to be right to everyone."

"MV is right, Sue. You agreed to all of these charges when you clicked the “I agree with the terms and conditions “ box when you made your purchase.Did you read those terms and conditions that you agreed to?"
it said on the term and condition that if my flight had canceled because of the airline it could have a full refund. that's ok. I already report to unfair trading and if the law said so we have to pay fee. No problem I will follow the law. MV is obviously did not do the refund and got to pay for the fee. But lot and lots of us are victims and lost job struggle with financial depression. Other travel agents give full Refund because they are good company. We are bad lucks buying tickets with an untrustworthy company.
"""But lot and lots of us are victims and lost job struggle with financial depression.'Yes, I agree, this is an absolutely terrible time with lots of people losing money, their businesses,their jobs and their lives.""We are bad lucks buying tickets with an untrustworthy company.""Sorry, but the only bad luck was the COVID thing. You could have done just a bit of research about this company and found out that they are horrible with customer service and that their fees for changes were ridiculous. And not just during this crisis but going back years - each to find with an internet search.So no, it wasn't bad luck that you booked with them, it was a bad decision on your part. Decisions have consequences, I'm afraid.I know this is harsh, but it's a fact.Edited: 8:02 am, April 20, 2020 "
"It didn't say that, Sue. It says what MV has transcribed. Unless you printed out something stronger, you have to go by that.Most of the Online Travel Agents are charging the fee. Skim this board for thousands of complaints about the lot of them"
"Basically Sue when you book directly with the airline, you are the airline’s customer and if they cancel the flight you get 100% refund.When you decide to use an agent to buy a ticket, you are the agents customer and not the airline’s. The agent is the airline’s customer. Agents have overheads and staff to pay. They can’t sell you cheap tickets and do extra work for free. They’re upfront about that though. They list all their fees and you have to agree to these before they will buy a ticket for you.So it doesn’t matter if the airline is giving a fee free refunds to their customers as you aren’t their customer. what matters is the contract you have with BYO Jet. They’re fully entitled to charge their fee for getting the refund from the airline and then passing it onto you.In future, if you want to avoid paying agent fees, don’t use agents."
"""Other travel agents give full Refund""Oh no they are not."
"I would not trust this company one inch. They sold my son a flight back from Australia to the UK in March, despite the fact that the flight had been cancelled 24 hours before they sold it to him. They were still selling seats on this flight 24 hours later & charging more money for them! Their response to our claims for a full refund have been frankly laughable, offering us a voucher that is valid only out of the airport from which the original flight was from. To reiterate, they sold us a flight that didn't exist & won't give us our money back. The way they are acting is disgusting & they clearly have no integrity whatsoever. Scum bags!"
"Sounds familiar, poppy. This thread is 7 years old for a reason. Did your son do any research before you jumped at a ""cheap fare""? Did he read the Terms and Conditions he agreed to?They are a terrible company, but they operate on the edge of legality, taking advantage of folks who don't do research or read what they are agreeing to"
"Take your complaint to your travel association, https://www.abta.com. I did in Australia and got a refund."
"Hi I genuinely would not use this company. They present positively and I think are a subsiduary if Flight Centre, but when things go wrong they lock your funds in and charge charge charge for each minor change per person ! Go else where AVOID AVOID AVOID"
"Do not use this company. They owe us £7,670 which Emirates have authorised a refund on and BYOJet refuse to give back to us some 3 months later. For clarity : in the event of cancellation you are entitled to a FULL refund from whoever you booked. No fees, no nonsense - a full refund.Under EC261 2004 that is obliged to be processed within 7 days of cancellation."
"Tony,Yet another selective application of consumer legislation. You are entitled to the refund minus whatever fees are levied by Byojet. EU261 applies to airlines and their customer - you are neither."
"Tony: this thread contains SEVEN YEARS.worth of complaints.You should have zero expectations of satisfaction, but the fact that they are still operating suggest they know how to stay on the barely legal side of things.You need to chose who you give your money to better."
"Tony, if you give a stranger on the street $5000 to buy you tickets then that stranger is the customer of the airline. If the airline cancels the flights, then yes, those funds must be returned by the airline, but obviously to the stranger. That is all the law requires. Now what the stranger gives you is up to what you agreed upon when you initially handed him the money. In this case you did agree to pages of terms and conditions and even verified you read them. The real question is, why hand over the money to the stranger in the first place? Why not go directly to the airline and purchase your own tickets? You want to have your cake and eat it too. You try to cut out the airline at the beginner by thinking you’ll get a cheaper price with a middleman, but now that something has gone wrong you want all the protections and services provided to those who ponied up and bought with the airline in the first place."
"There's absolutely no way that the 7 day law can be adhered to at the present time, Tony, even if it did apply, which it doesn't. I doubt that many courts would find it reasonable to expect any company to refund it's customers in a week when there's an enormous global health crisis which has led to many thousands of flights being cancelled, which in turn leads to many millions of refund claims.The last three replies are also quite correct to point out the flaws in Tony's reasoning."
"BA flight cancelled due to COVID.... requested refund from BYOJET and they emailed back on Friday night with ""based on the latest commercial policy of the airline, your ticket is not eligible for refund"".... I replied on Sunday night with ""in the event of flight cancellation, a passenger's eligibility for refund is not determined by the airline, but rather it is subject to governing law - in this case the relevant law is EU regulation 261/2004"".... within a few hours, BYOJET emailed back with ""we just received the update from the airline and it shows that your ticket is already eligible for refund"".... unsurprising to see them trying it on, but wonder how many people accept the ""credit"" that BYOJET offer after reading emails from them saying that is the customer's only option...."
"I know some of you are trying to get a Byojet refund and ive just successfully managed to get one after them taking months of ignoring calls and online forms, its been hell.So what you need to do is email them atassist@byojet.com (Which I cannot see listed on their website), tell them you need your refund and put all the info.Then email skyscanner help and tell them Byojet is ignoring your calls and emails.You should then be emailed by both within days and Byojet will acknowledge sky scanners request.I literally got a refund within 3 days and I have been trying for months."
"What proof do you have that it was your emails that expedited your refund, as distinct to the refund finally being made in the normal (in these non-normal times) time being taken?"
"Under NO circumstances use BYOjet. They have NO ATOL accreditation. I booked a March 2020 Business class flight from LON-BKK and the refund is a nightmare. They send generic responses to any e-mail enquiries. Absolutely impossible to contact via phone. Finally I received an e-mail indicating their cancellation fee which was fair and an additional £455 Airline Fee. When I double checked with Emirates, there was no cancellation fee. Need I say more? The matter is now in the hands of my credit card Company."
I booked a flight in February 2020 with byojet.com. Due to covid I couldn't take my flight and everything has been refund last week. It takes time and I advise everyone to call and ask nicely. Thanks you to byojet team !
"Give me an e-mail address and I will send all your e-mails dating back to 06/03/20 all promising refunds withn 12 weeks, culminating in an e-mail on 01/06/20 recommending me to coordinate with my issuing Bank, which I have and I e-mailed BYOjet the following day to this effect. Additionally I will send the conflicting e-mails with Emirates."
6 months???? Yup go team!!!!
