"Hello everybody I booked for the period 14 to 22 feb before knowing that there is a corona outbreak Now i am little bit nervous specially that i am taking my kids with me , so no control over them to avoid everything in the airports We will be landing in sabiha airport Do u think canceling the trip is a good idea"
"elman almajid, I am surprised at your post. There are known outbreaks of coronovirus in United Arab Emirates and that is what you need to worry about. Here are the current list of countries which has confirmed coronovirus outbreaks: ""https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/count…"". While UAE is on the list Turkey is not.All Turkish airports are well equipped with detection of and protection against coronovirus. They are all equipped with termal cameras and flights to and from China have already been cancelled till further notice. If you have any suspicion of any member of your family carrying coronovirus, please do cancell your trip and take care of your health. Otherwise you can safely visit Istanbul and Turkey.good luck,enigma...Edited: 2:30 am, February 04, 2020 "
Thank you mr engima for your reply And i just realized that my country was recorded wrong in tripadvisor as i am from bahrain . And my main concern was the airport and it is good to know that all flight from and to china was canceled Thank u again for your reply.
"Hello everybodyI booked my Istanbul trip (4-17 April.2020) last year in January before the corona outbreak. All the flights and lodging had been paid (I don't know whether it's possible to get refund for cancelling)Now i am little bit dissapointed (I had planned for this trip for about 3years), nervous and undeciding whether to cancel the trip or not. I'm from Malaysia and will be flying via Singapore Airline, and also will transit for about 2 hours in Singapore Changi Airport. I will be landing at Istanbul new airport.Do u think canceling the trip is a good idea"
"Did you read post no. 1 on enigma's response? So far there is no coronavirus cases in Turkey and did you also know that Malaysia has 19 coronavirus cases - click on the link in enigma's post? I think it will be best if you update yourself with recent news before getting afraid with no reason.Edited: 12:24 am, February 14, 2020 "
"Niza, you should be far more concerned about the possibility that a second wave of route suspensions will be coming."
"The latest news looks really good, there is only one suspected case reported in Turkey, and he is in isolation in a hospital. https://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/2020/02/10…"
Don't forget MikeSwampEast from these forums was shacked up in isolation in Istanbul recently.
"It does seem that the authorities have been quite assiduous about testing. 2,400 tests is a decent number, compared to the UK's 2,500, especially given that the illness has spread almost exactly as forecast by models. (For some reason, Turkey is spared the first order effects in those.)Inevitably, of course, it will come to Turkey. And then we shall see how we cope."
"We visited istanbul during the the last 5 years with various threats which included terrorism and the failed coup..i feel the above were far more a threat than corona virus and we still came as we thought the risk no more than any other country.( we landed 24 hours after the failed coup attempt with only 12 people on it ) and had no issues, in fact we had our best trip as everyone was out celebrating.we arrive on the 16th of feb and no isolated cases cases of the corona virus will stop us coming..(in fact we relish scare mongering and use this to our advantage around the world for cheap holidays, we were in Kiev 24 hours after the downing of a plane and cairo 48 hours after the uprising.)Scare mongering is pointless and damaging to an economy, however good for me and my family for a great cheap holiday with no queues.."
"Maybe slightly off topic but relevant to how much notice you take of scaremongering as martin m in the previous post rightly says.Just over two years ago we booked a month's stay in the north of Bali - very close to the volcano, Mount Agung, which the international press were determined to convince the world was about to erupt.We continued with our plans. One morning UK news announced ""Mount Agung had erupted. Thousands of people had been evacuated"". We walked out of our apartment to see a few puffs of white smoke from the mountain summit. No eruption. People had been evacuated weeks earlier as a precaution.We all need to avoid unecessary risk to health and life but should base our decisions on FACTS not random internet searches or guess work - or from travel-related forums!Keep safe everyone.Edited: 5:00 am, February 15, 2020 "
"Hi, I was trying to find out the link to any travel advisory (route suspension for instance) issued by the Turkish authority since I'll be flying in from Malaysia, transiting in Dubai. Appreciate if anyone can point me to it. Don't want to be turned away or sent for quarantine when I reach SAW after almost 20 hours of flying! Thanks!"
"Travel to China has been suspended. Otherwise, you are looking for a link that doesn't exist. There is some pressure to suspend other routes to the general East Asia region, and Turks have all but stopped travelling there as per the news, but for the moment at least visitors from Malaysia are fine.Edited: 7:32 pm, February 15, 2020 "
"After all, there are only 22 reported cases in Malaysia at the moment, which is statistically no different to the number in the UK or Germany."

"Even your home isn't safe enough, if you're sharing it with other people. The best thing to do is build a negative pressure isolation room just for yourself and not step foot outside for the next 18 months."
Rightly said GG..spreading negativity won't help anyone here..we can't just sit at one place and live with the fear of coronavirus....please reftain doing so..it discourages and frightens the travellers like us.
I don't think you interpreted what GG was saying correctly.....
You might be right Spotboy..i might have added what i felt saying over GG's viewpoint.
"So what's the current update? Some friends are planning to come next week from Jakarta and are worried they might be quarantined or deported upon arrival as a preventive measure.If anyone here just arrived in Istanbul from South East Asia and share their airport and arrival experience, I'd be most grateful."
"Hı Yositako,Glad you appeared here again. The current situation is that only flights to and from China and İran have been cancelled but all the rest of the passengers go through unobtrusive thermal cameras. Any time temperatures above normal are spotted, that person is given medical exam and coronavirus is thoroughly investigated and if found the passenger is quarantined immediately.Hence my suggestion is anyone not feeling well and has suspicion of fever, should not attempt to visit Turkey at the moment. However healthy persons should not worry about travelling to Turkey at all.Enigma..."
"For my friends who are still planning to travel to Turkey, I usually refer to two World Health Organization's link with relevant information:1. WHO general information site on Coronavirus:https:/…novel-coronavirus-20192. WHO’s standard recommendations for the general public, to reduce exposure and transmission; and downloadable pictorials on the Coronavirus.https:/…advice-for-publicNote that:*Currently knowledge on this virus and the way it behaves is still scarce. Many factors are poorly understood and currently under investigation. The best advice is to use common sense and observing some basic and simple hygiene measures. Please find the relevant information in the WHO links.*Recommended purchasing hand disinfectant stations. Please note that the disinfectant product needs to be alcohol based in order to be effective against virus, there is a lot of anti-bacterial products on the market which do not serve the purpose to prevent transmission of virus."
"No, Neerajnimi was right. Look guys, if we go, we all go together. Other than a determination to avoid breaching quarantine in parts of China, nothing really makes much sense.But everyone should make up their minds for themselves."
"Thank you, Enigma. My friends have been looking forward to this trip and they are concerned they might not be allowed into the country. I will pass on the info to them and hope they'll fall in love with Istanbul the way I did. Thanks again."
"We were also scheduled to travel to Turkey and Jordan late march to late april but ended up cancelling our plans not because of fear of corona virus but because of how governments, airlines, and local places would react if some cases emerged in Turkey. Our airline waived the cancellation fee so got a full refund. As the hysteria keeps building up, I have no regrets about the cancellation."
"Xandra, needless paranoia! Turkey is one of the countries that has NO coronavirus cases. But US has lots of them. So should we all cancel our plans to visit US now? And as you say how are the governments, airlines and local people reacting to these coronavirus cases all over US???If you want to live your life led by paranoias, that is your choice. But please do not try to spread your infection to others.Besides being a first time poster does not help your credibility.Enigma..."
Can we really trust that there are no cases in Turkey?
"Maplady. I'd rather trust the Turkish Government on this one, who have been proactive, installed thermal scanners at airports to non-intrusively check passengers on entry etc....Compare this to the British Govt that haven't even been able to offer any support to their citizens at home or abroad; let them sit, wait and die on a luxury cruise ship in Japan whilst other nations swiftly implemented evacuation procedures to get their citizens home.Edited: 9:04 am, March 01, 2020 "
"I am sorry but due to lack of a free press and various other political deficiencies in Turkey, I do find it hard to trust the government there. Don't want to get into a political argument but I can't imagine them being open about this."
"MapLady, If there were cases in Turkey, your government with its supreme intelligence would know that. And you would be informed. This is not something you can hide.By the way, our governments reaction to your coronavirus cases was to make UK citizens visa exempt. That simply means that we trust that you enforce isolation procedures to the fullest extent.Let me ask you a question. There are a number of coronavirus cases in London. Do you think I should cancel my travel plans to visit London this spring?Enigma..."
"It depends, actually. If you are elderly, or have health issues, then perhaps. I can see this getting worse. Just today more flights have been suspended. It's a personal choice. Not necessarily about health but about the possibility of being stuck somewhere or unable to return to where you need to be. Was the UK/other countries visa decision related to coronavirus? Even with a visa there were no health checks."
"Turkey does not have the same free press as the UK, ergo there must be infections.I must assume there is also no telephone network, that emails don't work, and Turks of all stripes have all taken a vow of silence to support the Government's coverup. Because Turks are, after all, know for being tight-lipped.The logic escapes me. ..Patience, you'll all get your desired case of coronavirus in Turkey soon enough.Edited: 9:49 am, March 01, 2020 "
No need to take it personally. It was a genuine question. Do you really trust that governments everywhere will be open about this?
"No, I don't.However, I have researched every model of a virus escaping from China, and in none of them does it reach Turkey in the first wave; this should not come as any surprise to those who know the number of both casual and business contacts that China has. I have also been following the news on social networks in Turkey, where people have set up cameras outside hospitals! People find ways of compensating for untrustworthy governments. Stunningly enough, we value our health as much as you do yours.Now, eventually, it will reach Turkey too. And soon, I imagine. But given that asymptomatic carriers are responsible for much of the spread, we shall just have to be, ahem, patient.As for my taking offence, I don't. But do be very careful about what you write. We're not discussing the pros and cons of a restaurant or even a taxi scam here. Doubly so, since it is obvious that people have started to panic.Myself, I arrived back in Istanbul about a month ago from London, and I had intended to fly back to the UK today, but I'm staying. If there is any truth to the summer squeezing out the coronavirus, I feel I have a better chance in the south of Turkey."
"Thank you for your reply. I fear it is only a matter of time, considering the numbers in neighbouring countries. I do not believe in fear mongering but having been personally affected in economic terms by this outbreak, and seeing many colleagues and friends getting stuck in third countries, it pays to consider various aspects (not only health). Let's hope the hot weather helps."
"will visit Istanbul mid March for a week. Traveling from Houston, TX directly to Istanbul by Turkish Air.Is it a good risk to go to Istanbul during coronavirusscare"
"At present, there are no reported cases. But given the way the virus spreads, especially through asymptomatic carriers, I would expect it to crop up in Turkey in March too.Whether you consider that an acceptable risk is up to you."

"Hi Enigma, Thanks for your responses and links. Very helpful indeed as I can't find any updates on entry restrictions. I think most travellers (or me at least) are more concerned of being quarantined the moment I step foot at the airport :) As I'm transiting in Dubai, I need to keep track of both countries' restrictions. This forum has been very helpful in this aspect. Also, as an Asian (especially of Chinese descent) I'm wary of the looks I might get while travelling, and am especially worried about being denied check in at the hotels.Hopefully the situation will improve and am really looking forward to this trip. Would not cancel it for anything unless Dubai/Turkey impose entry restrictions to Malaysians :) :)"
"My wife and me have also boked a trip to Istanbul and Konya from From Finland for a stay of 2 weeks in April . We have not cancelled the bokings, but we are studying the situation, If the situation gets worse, we would consider cancellation for not taking the risks"

"If it is so safe and controlled as you write, good that is what we need. But I read in another forum from a patient, it was not even very easy to be tested in Istanbul, had to travel from hospital to hospital, and the test was done in Ankara where the test had finally to be sent.I am neutral in my judgement, but the health should be the prime concern for everybody. So we should ourselves find out the facts and do a risk analysis before deciding what to do."
"DrFinland, even the US today has exactly two centres for final results from tests. Moreover, unlike Turkey, they do sometimes put off the test for quite a while, not just a few hours' delay between hospitals. I very much doubt Finland has multiple centres providing instant accurate results, but would be interested in learning otherwise.I look forward to your travel to Turkey and your review of Turkish health practices and response to the epidemic. After all, a proper risk analysis requires some knowledge and a few facts, neither of which you are likely to get from wherever you are now. ;)Edited: 11:29 am, March 02, 2020 "
"You may all be somewhat amused by the latest advice from the Minister for Health; that Turks should not travel abroad unless absolutely necessary. Alas, I know all too many people ready to get out of the country during the next school holidays.And I will amend my previous post a smidgen.

"I didn't know that, but thanks to TK they've had that system in place for years.(Off on a tangent here... I'm sure you're aware of the requirements for a free hotel or tour courtesy of TK, and that they're available only if you have a forced layover. TK have been making sure that in cases where people had connecting flights before/after Istanbul that they didn't choose them to make sure they got the freebie. The forced layover really had to be forced.)So this would just be an expansion of that. What a wonderful world we live in.... :/In other, possibly unrelated news, temepratures were up to 21C in Istanbul today, and high teens are forecast for the rest of the week. 22C is the highest temperature ever recorded on this day, so an unusually warm winter is turning into an exceptional spring.As per the highest of US authorities, that means we're all safe.Edited: 12:30 pm, March 03, 2020 "

"@Digvijay: The Turks seem to suspend flights and entry only when the number of cases has gone comfortably above 1,000, and sooner only if there's an issue with a neighbouring country.

You should read this article about the coronavirus in Turkey: https://medium.com/@mtoktas38/why-corona-virus-cannot-affect-turkey-c18f3186acff
"I copy this announcement from doc martins site:The Turkish Ministry of Health have confirmed that until further notice, passengers without Turkish residency permits will not be permitted to enter Turkey within 14 days of a visit to China, South Korea, Iran, Iraq or Italy.If a passenger has a residency permit, they may be allowed to enter Turkey but they will be tested on arrival for COVID-19.A positive test will lead to the passenger going straight to the quarantine facility.A negative test will lead to mobility restrictions – either self-isolation or full quarantine for 14 days.You should carry additional supplies of necessary medication in carry-on luggage."

">>>Looks like Covid-19 would have arrived in Turkey or at least at its airport.<<<It is worth mentioning that the passenger was found positive in Singapore airport tests at an outbound flight of turkish airways.

"HI JapetusIt was for an inbound flight into Singapore from Turkey. Not outbound. Possibly someone who transited in Turkey, in which case depending on the length of transit, some airport workers could have got exposed.Anyway, sooner or later it will arrive. No country apart from North Korea, perhaps, would remain unscathed."

"Niza, the health concern is always a top priority.Eventhough Turkey has not verified any Coronavirus case, it does not mean nobody is infected in Turkey.

There is a possibilty there are undetected cases in Turkey.For the individual traveller, a sound judgement of the situation is needed.It is a question of our own health.Good luck whatever you decide."
"True, although Turkey has not reported yet any Coronavirus infection, there is a good chance there could Coronavirus positive cases inTurkey. Neutrally thinking, everyone has to take preventive measures, as this is a world -wide public health issue.Every individual has a unique responsibilty for preventing the spread of the disease.

It is indeed a great success for Turkey so far and that needs to be congratulated for a good job well done. Those ""0"" cases simply mean that Turkey is doing a good job in protecting its borders, her citizens and her visitors. And I do not think any of the posts are one sided. Whether there are some unknown carriers of the virus in Turkey or any other country of the world is really irrelevant since no one can detect them unless you test all the population one by one and that would be impossible in every way. So let us just concentrate on the known cases of the the coronavirus and increase our preparedness for avoidance and protection at the first phase. enigma..."
Finland 7 - 0 Turkey...is a one-sided scoreline indeed!
"I am curious why DrFinland is somehow negative about Turkey. Turkish government has tackled and done their best in regards to coronavirus pandemic. At least in Turkey has 0 cases. Being in Turkey myself, I feel safe and secure!"
"Numbers of incidents in the state we are now are irrevelant. I find more reliable in countries with low or none reported cases, the numbers of cases in regard to people being tested rather than just the cases found positive. If a case is not tested with the proper test kit but rather treated as a severe case of flu, is an incident not recorded. Does Turkeys health ministry disclose such numbers? Like at the example here: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ESXiWaoWAAIcHoN…France has not disclosed data for the first dates, hence the recorded incidents are much lower than what they should. Lets not forget that yesterday we also had the first death of a turkish citizen who was living in france...I guess next week we will have some solid info as the 132 people that were on the last flight from Iran and apparently showed symptoms and quarantined on Feb 25 and never heard about them since, will have to be released as the 14 day quarantine period ends..I sincerely hope that the 0 incidents number is true, but the secrecy of info disclosed by the goverment is an issue..

"Personally i think we all need to get a grip..for normal healthy people it appears that the corona virus is no worse than the flu.Personally i don`t think we can avoid it.However if we and the world.carry on as we are we will still have the virus around in 5 years time and in the meantime destroyed airlines, hotels and restaurants and countries that rely on tourism.A personal thought.!!What If no one had found the different corona virus strain.. we would of all carried on as normal assuming we would of just caught the the normal cold/flu virus and the world would of still spun as usual..I will not change my travel plans or normal routines due to some cold/flu virus that is normally prevalent every winter..I visited istanbul in feb and will visit in april and may.i will benefit from media scare mongering bringing cheap flights and hotels, however it isn`t what i want to see to tourism..we visited istanbul 24 hours after the failed coup attempt and have been at all the places that had terrorist attacks some years ago as we travelled, during the time these attacks happened.nothing will make me change my decisions..i believe terrorism is a greater threat to my life than cold/flu and i ignore both.(i will never know if i catch the virus as i will never visit a doctor, i`ve survived the last 40 years without seeing a doctor and hopefully i won`t be visiting soon)I do worry about the elderly and the people with poor health, my mother is 95 and as much as possible our family will try and keep her safe and at home in her own little bubble til it passes..however we cannot keep her in her own home for years, thats ridiculous..In her own words.I`ve survived wars, health scares, cancer scares etc all unscathed, however if you want to keep me prisoner indefinitely, the words were..""if i have to stay within these 4 walls, put me down now"""
"food for thought..if all the scare mongering is to be believed (i don`t)best get it now as you`ll get it eventually.today there will be a bed in a hospital in isolation..in a months time there will be no beds left in any hospital in the world unless you are super rich..believe all the hype andWant a bed in hospital ?catch it now.Want to be in the shed in the garden for 14 days, run and hide..the choice is yours.."
"Lanni, it seems you have not read my post properly.I was writing about the health concerns everyone has in the world. The Turkish health minister has said on 2 nd March that eventhough Turkey has not tested any case positive for Coronavirus , there could eventually be cases undetected in the country.It is exactly what I have said too.In my own case, I have visited Turkey 5 times before and I have experienced my travels positively. I have even a travel booked to Konya next month from Helsinki via Istanbul, but health concern especially at the present situation is a serious matter for everyone."

"Controlling part of and leaning heavily on the other media is one thing; controlling news of a pandemic is quite another. Unless you assume Turks are blind or indifferent and stupid, that's not possible. As for tourism, the drop in crude prices over the past two months would more than covers the drop in net tourism revenues so there's no particular urgency there, yet."

I really wish Turkey would miraculously be able to keep Covid-19 away. I have a trip planned to Turkey this June and do not wish to cancel it. But then articles like the following do not inspire much confidence:https:/…
"I agree, and this is hotly discussed within Turkey too. Because, much as we would love Singaporeans and others to make stress-free visits to Turkey, people value their own lives too.We seem to be assuming that since this thing seems to make jumps with delays, we've somehow been fortunate and that the number of symptomatic patients is either zero or close to it. But once all the asymptomatic patients break out, I can't see why we shouldn't follow everyone else.Edited: 5:28 am, March 09, 2020 "
"Especially for DrFinland - thanks for your info, I am with you on your opinion indeed. In touch with some Turkish medical practitioners in Southern Turkey, they could confirm that, at least, they heard nothing related to Coronavirus in Turkey. Currently exporting medical mask and gloves from Turkey needs special permission from authority. While I am in close contact with friends in Van, there is no Iranian tourists following the border closing. Anyway, although the case of coronavirus is reported zero, the authority does their best to be prepared, just in case."
"Hi we are a family of 4 from Thailand planning a 10 days trip to Turkey in mid April. Absolutely unsure whether we should cancel or go ahead with the trip. We have made all bookings since last August. Me and my 2 grown up boys are ready to go ahead with the trip but my wife is too scared. 1 woman's voice seems to be louder than 3 men's. Hope things would get better soon, would be extremely dissapointed if we have to cancel our trip."
"For hp191074. I understand your views as the health concern is of prime inmportance especially at the present situation with Coronavirus spreading..Turkey has not yet tested anyone positive so far. That is a great thing that Turkey has alsotaken many precautionary measures at the airports etc.Still your wife might have reasons to worry. During a travel one comes in contact with many people. True there are even a number of infected people travelling, some without knowing themselves they are infected.You would be evaluating the situation yourself together with your family taking into consideration all the facts.Let me hope you would make the right decision.Edited: 10:26 am, March 09, 2020 "
"hp, İf the situation does not deteriorate radically all over the globe by April and if all your family members are in good health, I suggest you keep your travel plans and visit Turkey. So just keep up with the news and developments.Enigma"
"I booked a trip to Turkey (Cappadocia, Izmir, Istanbul) for two weeks in April and am flying in from New York. Although I am not panicked over getting ill from the virus (I am young, fit, and healthy and always keep myself clean), I am a little worried of traveling there as a person of East Asian descent. I'm curious to know if there is any growing hostility/resentment towards East Asian tourists. I have always heard that Turkish people are incredibly kind and hospitable and would be disheartened to think that my trip would be tainted by racially charged hostility. Everywhere I go I usually get a few instances of being treated badly because of my race but they're usually small things that I can brush off and continue enjoying my trip. My only fear is if this escalates into aggression or constantly being refused service. Does anyone know how the situation is currently for East Asian tourists?"
"Chip, that would be the very last thing you need to worry about in a trip to Turkey. Just like you say, Turkish people are indeed very friendly and hospitable to everyone of all races. We used to get lots of Chineese visitors till the virus breakout in China and the resulting flight suspensions to and from China.So my suggestion is keep your travel plans intact and come and enjoy Turkey fully.Enigma..."
"We are pretty confident with the situation in Turkey and we trust the Turkish government but what worries my wife most is any passenger arrives in Istanbul from a 10 hrs flight from Bangkok with cough or high temparature, every passenger in that flight would be quarantined. To be quarantined in your home country is not too bad but in a foreign land where we know nobody wouldn't be easy. We can only pray that things gets back to mormal soon and everyone can enjoy their trips wherever they have planned to."
"AFAIK, the current policy is to send any foreigners back to their home countries, but don't take that as gospel or a permanent scheme. But I agree that a 10 hours is a long time to be in close proximity to other people."
"In other news, Italy goes into shutdown overnight and the Australian Cabinet will be updating their travel advisory according to their press conference which just ended. If anyone thinks that travel advisories are worth the space they take up on your screen, does there need to be any further proof?"
First case noted in Northern Cyprus; a 65-year-old German tourist. Hotel in lockdown pending tests on everyone.
"In the words of the Minister of Health, in his most recent press conference:""It's highly likely this epidemic is already present. Therefore, while there are no confirmed cases as of now, they could appear in three hours or a day. I am not saying this to ease the way to such an announcement, but it is a fact that we have a great number of people travelling abroad. Who can say any one of them may not be infected? There are no guarantees.""Which is about as straightforward a comment as you'll likely see anywhere."
"Hi Folks,There are lots of speculations here at the forums as to why coronavirus cases have not said their ""hellos"" to Turkey. Here at the following link, originally in Turkish but google translated, there is a very good discussion on those reasons why there are no reported cases coronavirus infections in Turkey, thus far. Have a look at: ""https://tinyurl.com/uwkow8c"". Sorry for the poor translation by google but you can pretty much get the gist of the article.Basically every positive case has to be reported to the world healh organization of which Turkey is a founding member. However, since about 20 % of the people will remain as carriers and never get sick themselves, they can transmit the virus to others in close contact with them. This will happen everywhere in the world including Turkey. On the other hand Turkish government but especially the Ministry of Health have been very successful in taking the preventive measures since the very beginning of the news of infestation in China. The most drastic measures of suspending flights to/from highly infested countries and closing land borders with a few countries, right at the start, have been a great success while the highly infested EU countries still continued flights to Italy for example to this day. Turkey is also ready with 5 virus test labs in Ankara, Istanbul, Erzurum, Samsun and Antalya. As a vocal opponent of many of this governments decisions and actions elsewhere, I am very much impressed by the PROACTIVE stance of the Turkish government in keeping the coronavirus epidemic away from the Turkish territory, thus far. enigma..."

">>>I too was supposed to visit Turkey in April. After the news that came out yesterday, I canceled my trip. Apparently, someone who just came back from a vacation in Turkey reported a case of coronavirus:https:/…<<<I think it's probably best you stay locked indoors to be honest.You never know what kind of dangers might be lurking out there.At least you can't get taken by Corona Virus, air disasters, car accidents or shark attacks for that matter."
"In my personal case, I had a planned 2 weeks visit to Turkey in April with my wife Helsinki -Konya-Istanbul- Helsinki, but after quite much evalutations we have cancelled our journey.We do not wish to risk the infections at least on the way at airports, airplanes etc you never know where.We would wait for better times to visit Turkey."
IrinaI agree with you. Best decision you made was to cancel your trip and potentially prevent infecting the people of Turkey.
"Please stop being obnoxious and sarcastic. Some people are elderly or have conditions such as asthma, diabetes etc, which makes them more vulnerable. Also, many may not want to risk either being quarantined or unable to travel back due to bans and/or flight cancellations. It's a very complicated time with situations changing by the day."
"Yes, MapLady, but there's an awful lot of abbreviation and assumption. An American tourist who passed through Istanbul airport on a connecting flight from Albania is cause enough for concern, but it's hardly indicative of a resident population infected.It will come sooner or later, but I do wonder what purpose is served by ""I decided not to come because of xyz"". In that SpotBoy is, I think, spot on.Travel should be fun, and people are anxious, and for that reason alone I can understand why they may not wish to travel; you lay out even more cogent reasons. But those are not the justications given. And frankly, it's all become a little boring.I have little time for comments about worried about a pandemic from the citizen of a country whose leader had to meet with insurance companies today to confirm that testing would be free. Actual healthcare probably won't be. In that case, with perhaps one-fifth of the population unable to access healthcare, unless people do isolate themselves as SpotBoy suggests, these comments are grandstanding.Edited: 12:37 pm, March 10, 2020 "

"Maplady, I'm assuming the 'obnoxious / sarcastic' tag was aimed at me?If so, I stand by my post.Most of the posts are made by Westerners with a superiority complex.i.e. Is Turkey safe for them!!!The reality as it stands is 'Is Turkey safe from THEM!'So I'll continually challenge these posters, thank you very much!"
"It doesn't hurt to be kind, at a time when many people are extremely anxious..."
"MapLady, your previous post according to me is very correct. The individual tourist can have one’s own reasons, health issues etc, and it is the freedom of everyone to decide to travel or not Let me hope this basic human freedom is respected by everyone.If the individual traveller gets sick in a foreign country, it is just the traveller that suffers, not anyoneelse.at this forum."
Turkish knowhow requested from other countries..https:/…news
"Turkey's first case has been officially confirmed. The challenge now would be how well Turkey contains it.

Are overland borders crossings of foreign tourists from Iran to Turkey permitted? Or land crossing too closed for tourists?

Let's put this in perspective. Covid 19 is a flu strain. The flu virus hits the globe annually and kills 250 000+ every year. We don't panic about that number. It will run its course and we will find a vaccine.
"The virus seems to have scant regard for people's opinions or level of development. Whether a country is complacent and whether a country's leadership likes to stick its head in the sand does seem to have a correlation with how quickly it spreads.This is, at the end of the day, a novel epidemic, but not the Andromeda strain. The important factors are appropriate isolation rooms in hospitals, respirators where necessary and medication to fight secondary infections. We shall see how the Turkish health system copes with the increasing demands that will be placed on it. On past experience in Europe, it should spread in waves, and here distancing, hygiene, and discipline will matter, as well as swift measures by the Government when necessary. In places like Istanbul distancing is rather difficult in public transportation, and nonchalance is the national spirit.Given the timing, I'm not too fussed by the impact on the health system. But I do fear, yes, that this will spread as it has in even amongst the most conceited and irrational of people.Edited: 11:00 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"If I was in Istanbul I wouldn't panic but I would have a supply of P2/N95 disposable face masks. If a wave hits, then their use in public would be warranted."
That's what I am worried about too. Is that true that they would quarantine everyone on the flight?
""" Is that true that they would quarantine everyone on the flight?"" If there's a case, yes. Though so far they have sent foreign citizens straight back rather than keep them in Turkey.Edited: 12:23 am, March 11, 2020 "
"@Tzipora, to use common sense and logical thinking is important :) during this time. If you are not sure by yourself, better to stay at home. Coronavirus is pandemic but Turkish Government is ready in any case - enigma and Dr. John Campbell said they are doing Proactive-vely!!!"
"Take-aways from the midnight press conference, and other, later announcements:The subject is a man who recently returned from a trip to Europe, and who fortunately was paranoid enough to run for testing at the sign of first symptoms. He is now in quarantine, as is his family. He is said to have had little contact with anyone else, and they'rRe all being tested.But, of course, as the Minister said, this doesn't mean the virus isn't stealthily spreading within Turkey.Edited: 2:20 am, March 11, 2020 "
"sg6363, As you well know, China is the epicenter of Coronavirus infection. And do you consider Singapore a developed country?

Next week I planned to go visit istanbul and cappadocia with my wife. Is there any restriction or other information to enter turkey in current condition? And I'm depart from qatar
"This from the British Government Website.——CoronavirusThere is an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in China, some other countries in the region and elsewhere.The Turkish authorities have introduced a number of precautionary measures. All international passengers are being screened with a thermal camera. Those displaying signs of a temperature will then be referred to a medical adviser. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.The Turkish Ministry of Health have confirmed that passengers without Turkish residency permits will not be permitted to enter Turkey within 14 days of a visit to China, South Korea, Iran, Iraq or Italy. If a passenger has a residency permit, they may be allowed to enter Turkey but they will be tested on arrival for COVID-19. A positive test will lead to the passenger going straight to the quarantine facility. A negative test will lead to mobility restrictions – either self-isolation or full quarantine for 14 days. You should carry additional supplies of necessary medication in carry-on luggage.All passenger flights to and from Italy, Iraq, South Korea, Iran and China from Turkey have been cancelled due to coronavirus outbreaks in those countries. Land crossings with Iran and Iraq have also been closed.Keep up to date with information from your tour operator, transport or accommodation provider on the impact on any existing travel plans. Delays at airports are possible."
"Aan D, there is only one confirmed case of c.virus in Turkey. I suggest you keep your travel plans, as long as you are in good health. No special restrictions for you. If it is required of your nationality, you need a Turkish evisa or visa besides a 6 months valid passport.Enigma..."

"Notes on developments in Istanbul... 11th March.There is a noticeable increase in traffic today as people start to use their own cars more often instead of public transport. Buses, etc are remarkably less full at rush hours. At times, much more difficult to find a taxi.Some (maybe all?) private universities in the city have closed down their campuses and their residence halls. Students have been advised to return home. Teaching will continue via teleconferencing.Many larger companies that had not already begun to test staggered shifts or work from home have started to do so. However, this will probably not be implemented before the first case of local infection is reported.Schools may or may not be closed; this will become apparent later tooday together with any extra precautions, but there is tremendous pressure from parents. I hear that attendance at private schools has dropped by half. No-one wants the precious little buggers to spread the illness.Surprisingly, hand disinfectants can still be found, though they've gone up in price by about a third. but masks have shot up in price and only the N95/FFP2 ones can easily be found. No shortage of toilet paper, yet, but online shopping for essentials has also spiked.In the meantime, every person in immediate contact with the family of the first (imported) coronavrius case has been put into quarantine. People who have travelled abroad are all being asked to put themselves into isolation for 14 days, though I have my doubts about their willingness to do so if they do not show any symptoms.So far, so paranoid, therefore good. As news becomes available, I shall continue to post info.Edited: 9:57 am, March 11, 2020 "
"OK, I've been following the latest press conference chaired by the Minister of Health. (He's holding them at the rate of two a day at the moment.)Highlights:Schools will not be closed for now, with the ""for now"" stressed.In news that affects not just Istanbul but other places, the tourism shoulder season appears likely to be pushed back from the start of April to the start of May. Measures will be taken to reduce visits from abroad. (Meaning what, I do not know.) Cruise ships may not be allowed to even dock if they carry citizens of restricted countries (at the moment China, South Korea, Italy, Iran and Iraq, but may be expanded). At present, they are allowed to dock, but people from those countries are not allowed to enter.The elderly are recommended to avoid crowds. (Worth noting that just 10% of the Turkish population is over 65 versus 22% in, say, Italy.)Measures will be stepped up at 2,180-odd companies thoughout Turkey who are the leading providers of food.Trains to Bulgaria have been stopped. Coaches continue for now. (I assume it's not because of what's happening in Bulgaria - not much - but beyond.)""The risks are quite obvious. The rules that need to be followed are also clear. The risks are global. The solution will be local.""...In other news, the Istanbul Municipality has begun to spend 1.6 million liras a day disinfecting buses, trains, trams, etc as well as all metrobüs, ferry, and metro stations, but not tram or bus stations. (I can vouch for this having started this morning.) However, the hand sanitiser dispensers also provided at various stations cannot keep up with demand.Edited: 10:58 am, March 11, 2020 "

This does NOT affect the overwhelming majority of sites in Istanbul.Oh, and anyone hoping to pick up some eau de cologne had better be prepared for some inflated prices."
"Can you tell which museums now closed, please?"
"Ataturk's house in Şişli, the firefighting museum, the caricature museum, the Basilica and Theodosian Cisterns, Miniaturk, and the Topkapı 1453 museum. I can't think of any more."
"Midight, 12/13 March:Children will get a week's unexpected holiday from 16th March and return to studies, but via distance teaching on the 23rd. Fortunately, Turkey has a considerable amount of experience in this; it was last successfully employed after the Elazığ earthquake.Universities are shut (I assume state universities) for three weeks from the 18th. Some sort of Open University-ish setup, and also via the internet, will be provided instead.All sports events will be held without spectators.Measures are being taken to delay the spread of the virus in army barracks and prisons.Mr Erdoğan's visits abroad are suspended."

"Another big thank you to GrandGourmand from me, too. We have been traveling in Turkey for the past 10 days, and it has been wonderful, as this first trip is winding down, we know we want to come back again.We are currently in Cappadocia (Göreme), tomorrow we fly to Istanbul for our last few days before heading home. I very much appreciate your updates.Can you elaborate and continue to update on the current situation (and the current “feeling”) in Istanbul? Are the major sights (other than the limited places mentioned above) all open and accessible? Shops and restaurants all ‘business as usual’? How do things “feel”?

"Hi Folks,Yes, second coronavirus has been confirmed as GG says. This person is from the immediate family of the first case so obviously close contact resulted in the infection of the second case. Have a look: ""https:/…news"".On another note that shows the bias and ill intentions of the western press towards Turkey, here is how N.Y.Times has reported the American ban of flights to Europe, with a pic from the Blue Mosque in Istanbul on the front page.

"""Can you elaborate and continue to update on the current situation (and the current “feeling”) in Istanbul?"" Life goes on, but everyone seems to be preparing for an Italian-style outbreak, just in case. In addition to the govenment's and municipalities' actions, I've spoken with all my friends at a large number of companies this morning in different sectors, and they're already sending people home based on age and pre-existing conditions and if they have a lot of statutory leave accumulated, and preparing for work in shifts, work from home, etc. Which is nice and proactive. Even taxi drivers are going around with 80% alcohol to wipe their cars!So, no panic in general, but octogenarian-and-above members of my extended family are naturally anxious. We've been very lucky; Turkey missed (as expected) the firt wave of infections, had time to shore up necessary equipmen in hospitals, set up further testing facilities, and see what did NOT work elsewhere.But restaurants are still open (seem to be as full as usual) but people are not going window-shopping in malls as much as usual. And so many people are taking their cars to work apparently that I might decide to use public transport. :)"
"Comment from GG I take it as ""good news"" for Istanbul visitors. It may mean less crowded and less queues in interesting sites i.e Hagia Sophia, Topkapı Sarayi, etc. As resident in Turkey, I witness and respect very much the proactive manner of health authority to tackle the situation.Edited: 6:59 am, March 13, 2020 "
"I just came back from a little shopping spree - the government having said alcohol is useful, I've taken their advice to heart, even if not quite in the way they may have intended. For now, at least, things didn't seem to be any different to normal in the mall I visited. There had obviously been bulk buying of tea - let's concentrate on the really important stuff here! - but the mall was as crowded as ever on a Friday.Traffic was bad.But I imagine that from next week, life will be a little quieter, what with schools and universities closed, etc."
"Early p.m., 13th MarchThe requirement to mix ethanol into petrol for use in cars has been suspended for three months as part of measures to ramp up production of ethanol-based disinfectants.Turkey had some weeks ago suspended the export of masks, goggles, etc, but the government now says it will try to find ways to raise mask production, which is a maximum of only about 1.3bn units a year normally.All visits abroad by public officials put on hold.And here's a nice infogaphic containing the usual information if you should be a long term resident but not sure of what you should be doing: https:/…6f24ea99418dc8836e5c467d91a212e9.jpg"

Plan B? Somehow get to UK or Ireland and fly back to the USA direct from there?
Or fly directly from Turkey...

Hey I'm due to fly in to Istanbul timeouts from the UK. Absolutely terrified that they'll cancel my flight back on Friday. What happens if they stop the UK flights? Will the UK repatriate us??
"What they have meant by ""travel bans"" has so far meant that anyone actually in Turkey stays for the duration of their holiday, and then departs on the flights back home. Ditto for any Turk that happen to be abroad at the same time. So Turkish Airlines at least continues to fly. It's a ban on people entering rather than a cessation of flights, at least to begin with. I wouldn't worry.Edited: 7:32 am, March 14, 2020 "

"“What they have meant by ""travel bans"" has so far meant that anyone actually in Turkey stays for the duration of their holiday, and then departs on the flights back home”That’s not what TripAdvisor Destination Expert Enigma posted above. His post was quite explicit: all flights from the 9 countries and TO those 9 countries were to be stopped early Saturday. The news article he linked said the same thing. To confirm that,I googled and found several reports from reputable sites that said the same thing.Personally, I’ve spent the past 36 hours since reading those posts scrambling to try and find a way home. We’re cutting short our trip, my wife is heartbroken. I know of other travelers now desperately looking for ways out of Turkey that bypass the flight bans - trying to go via Russia, Ukraine, Thailand, anywhere. I was in Göreme yesterday when the news of the ban broke. Everyone there we spoke with were ending their trips early, spending money on new flights, leaving as quickly as they could.Now you’re saying that everyone should complete their original plans, all the flights will be going as scheduled?A LOT of people have just burned a lot of money on next-day air tickets, just to “get out” before the last options to get home disappear, based on posts in this thread."
"""Now you’re saying that everyone should complete their original plans, all the flights will be going as scheduled?"" It is what I have been saying all along. As witnessed by two comments today on this forum, one from a Russian I think in Anara who saw Germans flyşng back, and another from a German I believe in Antalya whose flight was still scheduled. Looka round the threads and you'll find them.Turkey is unlikely to want to keep foreign citizens within Turkey, and it won't strand its own abroad."

Your Government is supplying citizens with masks? That is excellent!.
"And they arrived! They're stitting outside my door, for the moment, though. :)"
Wow - masks supplied by the government. So (so) different in the U.S. Very glad news indeed and I'm thrilled for all of you in Turkey!
Masks are now going to be distributed free of charge by the government through all pharmacies in Turkey. 5 masks will be given for each person for 10 days and at the end of 10 days one can get another set of 5 masks. People will be sent SMS codes from the Ministry of Health to pick up their masks from the pharmacies. enigma...

Need to know if there are hotels opened end of April and in May. Both in Istanbul and Antalya.
"@Elisabeth - some hotels might be opened although I am not sure at all. The best will be to be in touch with the hotel(s) you plan to stay. However you mentioned the period of end of April and May, sincerely I doubt if the hotels will be opened. If you are not in Turkey at present: the travel intercity in Turkey is banned except if you have solid reason to travel and it must be approved by local governorate. In addition, Turkish Airlines extends the period of no-international flight until 20 May.Edited: 11:14 am, April 16, 2020 "

"Hi Guys,Anyone can update me on current restrictions due to coronavirus in Turkey? The info on the subject is quite limited online. I presume that the tourist attractions and historic sites are probably closed for public. Any exceptions from the rule? How about hotels and intercity bus and air travel as well as restaurants? Also if anyone can point me to the official government info on the subject that would be great. Any info is greatly appreciated. Thank you, Oleg"
"Not only are tourist attractions closed, but so are parks, cafes, restaurants, etc. No exceptions. I have heard a rumour about hotels but I shan't repeat it here until it's been reported officially. Look at newspapers such as Daily Sabah or Hurriyet for updates."
"@Oleg, as you're posting in an Istanbul thread, I assume your question is related to Istanbul.Some very few hotels are open, but really only for official business. Otherwise, all air, land and sea traffic into and out of Istanbul remains forbidden (unless you're carrying food or medicine or have a very-difficult-to-get special permit). Restaurants, cafes, most shops, museums, etc are also closed. People are banned from walking along the Bosphorus, etc.This will change slowly, but the ""normalisation"" phase will happen last in Istanbul, which has seen the majority of Covid-19 cases in Turkey.In addition, no-one who is not Turkish or a resident or a diplomat is currently permitted into the country. That is expected to start to change in June, but quarantine restrictions will remain in force - that is to say, you spend 14 days at a facility of the government's choosing - until probably the end of the month. The Turks have a very flexible notion of scheduling and any news you may hear about the country accepting regular visitors from abroad on such-and-such a date should be taken with a pinch of salt, because it is likely to be revised. (Remember that the entry ban was originally until 30th April; we're now talking about June.)Since foreign tourism is the least of our worries at the moment, and because govenment plans are flexible, you will not be able to find anyone has bothered to put all this on an official page; non-Turkish updates are even more unlikely now than usual (and the usual isn't brilliant). Since the Ministries responsible are those for the Interior and for Health, foreign language advice will be even less readily available.The rule is simple: no-one can enter. There is no official date for when they can. When that changes, no doubt there will be something somewhere official in a more internationally accepted language than Turkish.Edited: 5:38 pm, May 13, 2020 "
"Oleg, the restrictions are relaxed greadually. Currently trhe malls are open, albeit on a limited scale without the food courts. The coiffures and barbers are open, with a lot of new restrictive rules in force for their operations. You can only walk outside with a mask and everyone needs to carry one.

Does anyone know about just transiting through Istanbul July 1?
"@Tigre: Transiting will most likely be in place, but the number of destinations may still be limited. TK is expected to resume flying to the 120+ countries it serves in stages, with some European and Asian countries being first on the list. But as these stages will take place in light of developments in Covid-19 abroad (for those merely transiting) and as no-one really knows what the situation will be five-six weeks from now, announcements as to which destinations are included and which are not will be are likely to be made much closer to the date."

"Hi,I am planning to visit Istanbul in early July. Do you have any idea what is the situation (Corona restrictions) at that time.. What I am most interested in are: Do people have to wear masks (not interested in such heat). Are all stores and restaurants open? Will Gyms be open? Will museums be open? Thanks"
"@Ramsu: People have to wear masks in all covered or busy areas (and I assume that will be extended to all areas), and keep social distancing. No, all stores are not open, and no restaurants, gyms or muesums are open. By July, other than the requirement to wear masks, things may change. But no-one can guess from today. Moreover, we don't even know citizens of which countries or people travelling from which countries will be allowed in. Check again much closer to the date."

Also, Turkish Airlines is selling tickets for direct flight between the US and Turkey. How are we supposed to know when we can actually take these flights that are allowed to be purchased"
"@All-of... It's a bit of a polite fiction that Americans aren't on that list, as there's no need for such a list, since *no-one* is allowed in, other than Turks and residents. ;) And they get tested and have to isolate even if they test negative. All that will change but, for now, you'll have to wait and see.We don't know whose citizens will be allowed after the borders start opening. When they do, there will be announcements. All airlines throughout the world are selling tickets based on supposed availability of flights and then rescheduling them. Also remember that if TK sells a direct flight between the US and Turkey, it doesn't necessarily mean that anyone on that flight will be allowed in.

"I know and agree. Well, it's all to do with pressure brought upon Turkey by the US State Department not to declare US citizens prohibited from entering due to infection rates in the US. The current situation is a win-win; Americans appear to be able to get in (legally) and someone saves face at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, but they can't (practically). Yay.However, there is another point to consider as well. Pretty much all the possible routes that Americans could take to get to Turkey (if flights were possible) entail travelling through countries which Turkey has indeed banned from entering. And if you travel through those, whether American or not, you can't get in, because you've been in an ""infectious"" country.Edited: 5:14 am, June 01, 2020 "

"And a final point. As Turks themselves are being required to self-isolate (proper quaranting has been lifted) after entry (even if they test negative), letting the citizens of any other country in without any precautions would be scandalous.(And see https:/…1580226297.htm regarding the second para in the previous post.)"
"Just for clarification, the flights are direct, with no stops in other countries. TA has said they’re resuming them, the Embassy says we’re not in the ban list, the inter city travel restrictions are being lifted, and the HES seems to only be for citizens. See how confusing this is for us? I’m not trying to cause a debate, my original question was how we are supposed to know when we can actually travel. What would your advice be to that specific question?"
And the answer to that specific question is no one knows for sure yet.
"Yes, I understand that. So I guess your advice would be to watch TA, and you’ll let us know?"
Yes. Things are changing rapidly.
And keep an eye on the government travel advice and/or admission policies.

"Due to untold numbers of people begging me to tell them how things are in Istanbul, I felt compelled to leave my flat for the first time since 12th or 13th May.The long and short of it is:Traffic is what you'd expect: heavy but not as normal. A mix of some having gone to their summer homes, schools being effectively closed, and general wariness. However, many more people seem to be using their cars rather than public transport, as buses, etc are all still required to accept only limited numbers of passengers - and there weren't huge queues at the bus stops. (Maybe during rush hour?) So traffic density is skewed up because of that.Foot traffic about half of normal, or even less.A Starbucks was open, and I'd run out of filter coffee so I went in. No tables or chairs inside, just take-away. 150 or 200 square metres, four people allowed inside. Queue anyway very short.I might have mentioned that I live close to a hospital. They had set up a triage tent in March; that's now gone.Everyone of course wearing masks indoors, with sales assistants and cashiers behind screens and some wearing visors. And almost everyone wearing masks outdoors, and unlike my foray out three weeks ago, correctly.Edited: 6:00 am, June 04, 2020 "
Is Istanbul Corona Virus free right now 4 july 2020 or is it a risk to go there ?
"Istanbul is certainly not coronavirus-free, though its local epithet as the ""Turkish Wuhan"" is somewhat less deserved. While there are a fair few places in Turkey which have a lower incidence of the virus than Malta, Istanbul is certainly not one of them."
"Well, having continued to isolate at home for another three-and-half-week block, I went out today.The situation here is quite funny. First, I had a business-y meeting this morning - Saturday - at 7 am.To get there, I took a taxi for the first time in months. I haven't seen a taxi this clean in years. Apparently, the municipality has them disinfected every day. :oIt was a pleasant meeting. Outdoors on a terrace. Everyone wearing masks and distanced; instead of tea and biscuits, disinfectant passed around. Short and sweet, done in just over an hour.Then took another taxi smelling like a hospital back home-ish. Had a lot of errands to run, so walked up and down, up and down, up and down the hills in my area; taxis are only for crossing the Bosphorus. :) Most corner shops working as usual, but a few have the door blocked and the till moved there. Everyone wearing masks indoors, but ouside a few still protecting their chins. I have turned into a crabby old man telling people off - someday, I'll encounter a complaint of karens and God knows what'll happen then.Now I have crept back into my flat, dropping my shopping off outside my door for the usual 72-hour waiting period. I shall no doubt have the usual psychosomatic symptoms over the next few days, but all the walking did me a world of good. :)Edited: 4:29 am, July 04, 2020 "
Thank you GG for your sacrifices all for the purpose of reporting back here.Geçmiş olsun (for the symptoms that will no doubt appear).
"It is nice to reading your positive experience by going out in morning time GG! It also inspires me to do the same rather than to wait until afternoon, evening, or late evening time. Well, it is grilling hot in Gaziantep - MGM forecasts max temp to be 39 degree this week :( It seems Istanbulites are more disciplines, bravo for that! Compare to the level of discipline, despite of the love I have to my baklava city what I noticed myself: Gaziantep is worse than other cities in Turkey in term of using mask and social distancing. No wonder my city has been ranked on the 3rd in case number in Turkey. My flat residence area has gone from low risk (in May 2020) to very high risk with red colors at present - according to HES map :((("
"Indeed, vipfamily, the things I do for the sake of people on this forum! :)Unfortunately, my app tells me that as a result I have apparently been in contact with more than four people for longer or closer than advised.So, throwing caution to the winds, I shall be out again tomorrow. I still have a few things to do, and I may visit a street market too! :oPictures to follow."
"I have not canceled my hotel bookings yet (in Istanbul and Cappadocia) for my trip in mid August.Last week, the hotel in Istanbul emailed me and asked if I am coming or not.

However, they did not mentioned about Americans, banned or not.Reading the email, I feel so sad, as I know they are struggling with their business and hoping to get some guests.

"""However, they did not mentioned about Americans, banned or not."" No-one's banned. Come one, come all.Honestly, even at current rates of relative infection, even if a million US tourists turned up, and each stayed a week, that'd be like adding 0.2% to the overall country tisk, so we're not too fussed.But be aware that you will, overtly or covertly, be scanned for a fever at the airport, and perhaps subject to random tests. And mask wearing is required everywhere, indoors and out.And happy birthday(s). Look at it this way. Those of us who survive this epidemic will have the opportunity of boring our grand- and great-grandchildren to death about the dreadful year of 2020, with its coronavirus, swine flu, amoebas, and all the rest. :) Lots of anniversaries ahead, I hope. :)Keep well. :)"

"Hi same here. We are due to go 6/9/20 for our birthdays , got tickets etc BUT unsure if to go . Dont fancy wearing face mask for 13hrs a day in the heat. If we do go I was thinking of buying a visor as wear glasses. Any help would be greateful. Happy birthdays by the way"
"I don't think heat would be an issue in Istanbul in September, but your decision. Visors do not substitute for masks."
Thank you for that it is helpfull. What is open for tourists and also what about the hop on off bus? Does the covid situation seem to be easing or are you getting a second wave ?
@Anne B: here it is small info about what's open for tourist https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29397… Nobody knows what will happen in early September 2020. Although I think Turkey is coping with the situation; this virus is very sensitive so just prepare mentally the worst. I would recommend yourself to be always updated with the news and make your own decision based on your own judgement and common sense.
One more question - is there any type of a tourist public transportation card? I will stay for 3 days. Teşekkürler.
"No, the basic Istanbulkart is what you'll need to get."
"Marko R, Here is all the info you need about Istanbulkart: ""https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29397…"".enigma..."
Planning to arrive to Istanbul for 5 days. Interested to see the town. Can't figure it out where is it safe and nice to stay? As I don't want to use local transport a lot. Do you think the area Eminönü is ok now or better not to? Really confused as the town is huge.
"Stepan Kuznetsov, If you do not want the tourist central at Sultanahmet, you can stay at Sirkeci, Karakoy or Galata areas, all central and close to attractions. enigma..."
Morning. Does anyone know if all touristy attractions are open i early September please ? as due to visit
"@Anne: Naturally, yes... normally. But who knows with this virus?"
"Anne B, They are all open now and I see no reason at the moment why they should not be open in September.enigma..."
Thank you for that. Can you recommend a good Hop On / Off bus tour to take on our first day ?
"Anne, this thread is specifically about covid. Can you start new threads for your non covid questions such as tourist attractions and hop on busses- after of course, you have tried to find the answers using the Search function and the Top Questions!...and as it happens, a hop on hop off bus is pretty redundant when the main sites are in a pedestrianised area within a moment or twos walk of each other!Edited: 1:24 pm, August 13, 2020 "
With the news that France has now also been taken off the UK quarantine exemption list - what is everyone’s opinion on the likelihood of Turkey following the same path?
"My advice would be to follow the numbers, which are available from a number of different sources. I like https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data myself.Edited: 6:41 pm, August 13, 2020 "
"GG, I personally like ""https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus"" about coronovirus statistics. However your link is also very useful because it indicates the doubling times of Covid-19 cases for each country, and that is also very relevant info. I also find the graphs in your link very informative.enigma..."
Thank you

"@Georgios: Someone has been pulling your leg. The tests now cost 250 liras in this case. Yes, it's possible to do at the airport, but it might be an idea to have it done in the city beforehand.Edited: 12:05 pm, August 17, 2020 "
"Georgios, Now why would the Greeks spread such false rumors. Totally false. There are no restrictions for visitors in Istanbul, except that you need to wear a mask, keep your social distance, and wash your hands frequently. Yes, you can get the test done at the airport any day. You will get the results on the internet the next day. good luck,enigma....Edited: 1:28 pm, August 17, 2020 "
"Good evening. Today we have been told Turkey may come onto the English list for quarantine when we return home from holidaying in Turkey. Do you know anything about this, as we have been told the numbers are going up with Covid 19 in Turkey"
@Anne B: Try this thread: https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g293…
"Georgios, First of all, you have got it wrong. Americans do not hate us. Secondly another wrong from you. You have misinterpreted the link. There are no restrictions on tourists of any age, and the link specifically says so. So basically the contents of the link are correct. I hope you enjoy Istanbul.enigma..."
