Starting October 1st visitors will NOT need a test result showing negative results within the last 5 days. Instead visitors will be randomly picked for a simple prick test. Also anyone with the virus will have insurance covered by the country of the Dominican Republic paying all expenses including the cost of changing airfare if needed because of the virus.
BobNHCan you please post your source that from October 1st visitors will NOT need a test result showing negative results within the last 5 days. As the date was not mentioned on the Government release to their Tourist Plan yesterday.Angie.
I’m sorry Bob.. this is not great news! This absolutely scares the crap out of me! The required tests make the folks who “throw caution to the wind” an excuse to continue to throw caution to the wind! I’d rather be somewhere semi safe knowing the people around us have been tested and test negative.

"No go here Bob all I get is :-This content isn't available at the momentWhen this happens, it's usually because the owner only shared it with a small group of people or changed who can see it, or it's been deleted.Is it a closed Facebook Group you got the info from ?Angie."
I agree with Post 2That would just make me not want to visit.... let alone get on a plane with who knows how many infected people
Very concerned here that we are planning on heading to DR on 9/27 and with the CDC guidelines that no symptoms means no test - we will not be able to get one here in the USA. We picked DR for our vaca because it was test within 5 days vs 2 knowing we would never get results within 2 days.
I'm sure P.C. Mike will chime in here soon. The new President declared this yesterday.
"https:/…This is what the new President, Luis Abinader said yesterday. It is in Spanish but basically he says that all tourists will be covered if they need medical attention because of COVID. As BobNH says tourists will be randomly tested when arrival to the airport."
Can we still bring test results to avoid random medical testing? I'd rather get tested at home in advance rather than worry about randomly being selected.
"If people are that concerned then get a test done before you go, it won't make any difference because you can still catch it anytime within 2 weeks, anywhere you go. Makes me laugh, this has been around longer than you think"
Correct. You can be tested today with no symptoms and be false negative. Test back in two days and be positive.
#8Yes we know what was said as I posted on another thread but no date was released. It was the Oct 1st date confirmation that I was after. See my post #6 in this thread below.https:/…107721412Angie.
"I just posted some images about all the new info the government issued yesterday in my professional profile. Not sure how to post it here, if this is not allowed I am sorry and please delete."
"I agree with post # 2. Having a mandatory negative test before travel gives a sense of security knowing that your fellow travellers are a little safer. I know it's not 100%, but it's better than nothing. I'd much rather have that than ""free"" insurance."
Free insurance just means they will pay for you to be quarantined in the DR if you test positive. Sorry love the DR but don't want to end up quarantined in a location the government picked. Removing having negative test will just mean countries like Canada and the UK will leave the 14 day quarantine on longer.
"SBDriver,I have just read the insurance that will be provided to the visitor is only until December 2020, so only covers 3 months if this all comes in on Oct 1st. if the date is correct.Angie."
CT I'm not sure if the DR's new plan would impact Canada extending (or not) our quarantine rule as I'm sure they look at all destinations and many do not require pre-testing. I am very curious to see if Canada will in fact extend the 14 days rule. Guess it will come out at the last minute with expiry date on the 31st.
CT<< Removing having negative test will just mean countries like Canada and the UK will leave the 14 day quarantine on longer. >>The UK does even have a 14 day quarantine rule for the DR in place as the DR is still currently on FCO no fly list for all but essential international travel.Angie.
Angelina52. Question. So if someone flies from the UK to another country and then on to the DR. When they come back do they have to quarantine for 14 days?
"SlyGuy23 Nothing official yet but from everything I have read it will keep being extended. The big question is for how many more months. My money is on at least until the end of the year.Edited: 12:26 pm, August 26, 2020 "
"It’s great news that they’ve gone from being someplace that seem to be doing the right thing where it would be considered a good spot for a vacation to just “come on down and get infected.” Because your fellow terrorist don’t really care. Not great news.Sorry but if you’re letting Americans travel to your country you need to be conservative. Because Americans don’t get it. We think a good fairy is going to protect us from Covid.I was looking at December vacation,DR probably just lost that business"
Carol A I agree 100%. Can't understand why when most countries in the world are trying to do more testing the DR thinks less testing is better. Makes no sense.
"CT yes, as much as I will not travel if they extend the quarantine, I agree that it does make sense to extend it and they might as well go to the end of the year. Another option as I mentioned on the other thread would be doing like the UK and have an exempted list of countries where you would not be required to quarantine on return (for countries with low risk of COVID)."
"Caribbean traveler. If you go from DR to a permitted country before returning to the UK,You would still have to quarantine unless you had been in the other country for longer than 14 days."
"Bob, I think it's great news too!"
"<< ""Great News! Test results not needed starting in October."" >>Sort of like saying ""Great news... metal detectors removed at the airport!""What could possibly go wrong?:-0"
I also think it is great news. I had no problem testing and I still would not but the 5 day PCR test was not easily attainable for many. If you had a Wednesday or Thursday departure you were in a very tough spot because you cannot overnight on the weekends. I arrive on Thanksgiving Day and was very concerned about being able to meet the requirement. The metal detector analogy is silly. You can travel on an airplane right now within the US without a test. You cannot travel without passing through a metal detector. To each their own on comfort level and willingness to travel in these times. No situation will please all and I believe the DR President is trying to responsibly save their economy.
"@RJP exactly! They need to test everyone at the departure city not at an arrival airport! If positive you stay home, why test in DR for instance randomly and potentially miss an infected passenger?"
"For those who believe testing is a must on arrival in the DR, I would be curious to find out how many have tested positive since the entry testing requirement came into effect."
"I just got back from Punta Cana two weeks ago. The airport uses infared to check for temperatures, everything at the resorts are being sanitized from transportation, to bags to rooms etc. Everyone is wearing a mask and I felt fully protected. The only change that was made since that trip was the unrealistic 5 day old test requirement needed to enter the Country. This requirement was not working and was dropped. They will still randomly pull people aside for testing and certainly flag anyone with a fever who shouldn't have been traveling to begin with."
"As much as we are itching to book our trip to PC and use our credit voucher from this past March...we are waiting on January before we start to even think about it. It’s hard to know about the second surge, and if countries are already relaxing their “rules” now, who knows what is going to happen in a worst case scenario. If the vaccine is invented by then...BONUS! Not holding our breath yet...but all fingers and toes are already crossed.Edited: 3:50 pm, August 26, 2020 "
"Me being a positive guy, new cases in the last 24 hrs , 340, lowest # since July 7th. Active cases down 700+ in last 24 hrs. Active cases down 12 straight days. Again, numbers are numbers but they are seemingly trending in the right direction."
"National Laboratory did not process PCR tests on Tueday due to technical problems.The National Laboratory Doctor Defilló did not process PRC samples this Tuesday due to technical problems, according to the Ministry of Public Health.In this sense, the entity establishes that yesterday only private laboratories issued results.According to the epidemiological report issued this Wednesday, in the last 24 hours, 2,585 samples were processed, of which 340 were positive.""Due to technical problems at the Dr. Defilló National Laboratory, today only the results of samples processed by private laboratories are presented,"" states bulletin # 160.The Minister of Public Health, Plutarco Arias, admitted on Tuesday that there is a bottleneck in terms of the delivery of the results of the COVID-19 tests that have been carried out on the population.In the country, 355,839 PCR tests have been carried out, which have ruled out 263,282 cases and confirmed 92,557 infections.At the beginning of August the deputy director of the laboratory, Golber Atis, reported that their facilities can process 2,500 tests per day, however, they receive around 5,000 samples, which generates delays in the delivery of results.Source - Diario Libre.Angie."
RJPPost 26Love it....
Sly.I read a report that the continuing active confirmed cases going down is because the number just includes tests carried out at private labs. The number of tests carried out at private labs is at an all time low. There is a long delay in cases pending for results and the tests carried out.Cannot find where I read the report at the mo but will try and find it later.Angie.
"All good Angie. As I've said many times, numbers can be manipulated many ways. My source: https:/…"
Bob.. what was 2 weeks ago is changing daily.. nothing personal but 2 weeks ago is now irrelevant
"Angie.. you’re 100% right. Counts are down because testing is down. Same here in the US. Sad, but true"
"I personally feel like this is good news. DR is trying to save their economy. From the articles I’ve read, it seems that they seek the advice of several international organizations and decided not to pursue negative tests from visitors. Some well not like it but at least in my circle, most loved the decision. Social distance rules, capacity limits, masks will still be requirements in the resorts, and most of should at least be aware of things that will help us avoid being sick... I see it is as a progressive move by the Dominican government."
Now we know why. Trump has ceased test in the US unless youre showing symptoms in order to keep the numbers down. No test means DR can’t ask tourists to come with negative test results. https://apple.news/ASTuRvCfjRjelSwUlvmh2aQI think I see another wave coming.....
"Just as we were starting to consider going due to increased safety protocols, it’s all come crashing down!!! Looks like the only ones coming to the DR will be Americans now. And a few very brave risk taking Canadians."
smittygirl #41Well why I am not surprised at that !Angie.
"Testing is still readily available in the US via public and private options. Stating that ""Trump has ceased test in the US unless youre showing symptoms in order to keep the numbers down."" is not correct. All the CDC did was change recommendations regarding testing. There is nothing about ceasing test on CDC website.https:/…who-should-get-testedEdited: 11:14 am, August 27, 2020 "

"@49 Scott You say ""if you are not sick...go on vacation"". The problem is, you may be asymptomatic, and not realize you have it. That is why having a negative test before travel is an added layer of protection for yourself and your fellow travellers."

That is not great news. I'm sure I'm not the only traveler that feels this way. Obtaining a test is a simple courtesy to extend to the country you plan on visiting.
