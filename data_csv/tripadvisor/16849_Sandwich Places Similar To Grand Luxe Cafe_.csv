"I like the grand luxe cafe at venetian/palazzo. Mainly because those sandwiches and salads are okay and not unhealthy like the other foods on the casinos.The other thing is it doesn't cost more than $8 total for a sandwich/salad. Does anyone know if any sandwich places similar to the Grand Luxe Cafe at Wynn, Bellagio, Aria and MGM Grand?"
"zoozacrackers @ wynn is very good, jean phillipe at Aria and Bellagio are along the same lines where they have salads and sandwiches"
Subway.
"Grand Lux is basically a glorified coffee shop, although in Las Vegas they are mostly called Cafes. Every hotel has one, at varying levels.Wynn has Terrace Point Cafe, Bellagio has Bellagio Cafe, Aria has Cafe Vettro, and MGM has the Studio Cafe (most overprice IMO)."
Bring some bread along with your eggs and make an egg sandwich.
"You can get a sandwich as healthy as any you will find at Grand Lux at just about any deli, coffee shop, cafe or sandwich place. Wichcraft at MGM makes a good sandwich. Society Cafe at Encore has a pretty extensive vegetarian and vegan selection."
And consider branching out from the sandwich/salad world - there's lots of healthy food readily available.
But what about the gluten epidemic?
"Bellagio Cafe was not too bad, and hours are very friendly to late-night munchies! I""m sure that is the case with all hotel cafes in LV ..."
"Unfortunately, Mirage closed the Caribe Cafe to replace it with B.B. King's to my eternal regret. I really, really miss Caribe."
"Snacks, the snack bar by the sports book in Bellagio, makes a nice sandwich also."
"You might enjoy the Earl of Sandwich at Planet Hollywood. This is counter service, no waitresses. There is a sandwich counter in Bally's, on the casino floor, by -- what is it, the south tower elevators?ABC Stores have some packaged sandwiches, I think.@Breeze, is there a Subway on the Strip?"
"Mike45LC, I think there's one in the food court in MC. At least that's what the website says..."
There was one at Casino Royale. Pretty sure it's still there.
"Definitely a Subway right on the strip. I believe at the Flamingo and Casino Royale.I hate to bring this to light on this thread as well... but the Grand Lux is simply a rebranded Cheesecake Factory. So, I wouldn't put too much faith that the sandwich or salad that you're eating there is a ""healthy"" option.Share a sammy at the Carnegie Deli at the Mirage instead. It's probably healthier and a whole lot more fun."
"@unda: Flight is a solo traveler.@various: Thanks for the Subway locations. Now that I am thinking about it, isn't there also one at Slots O' Fun? Subway is not on my list of places to eat at, so I tend to not notice where they are."
"You may like Snacks at Bellagio, but it's counter service."
Earl of Sandwhich is yummy
"Nosh at Ballys has good sandwichs. ( located in the front of the casino by the keno area )Earl of Sandwich at PH is very good, as is Fresh Grill and Bar in the Miracle Mile Mall.Also at Ballys is the Tequila Bar and Grill that has the $2.00 margaritas, tacos, shots and drafts. It's located at the back of the casino near the escalators that go to the pool."
"I saw this :""You can't eat healthy at the Cheesecake Factory"" post in another thread. It's just false. I saw the Men's Health magazine article, and the ""worst food"" award was based on the most obviously worst choices on the menu. The reason that Cheesecake/Grand Luxe gets the rap of being unhealthy has to do with the portion sizes and the worst fatty and caloric items they offer. They do have salads. (In fact they have a whole ""skinnylicious menu"" of healthier choices. Choose a low fat dressing or oil and vinegar and leave off the bacon and the cheese. You don't have to slather your toast with butter. You can order an egg white and spinach omelet, and you don't have to eat the whole thing. I am not a big fan of the place really, and I do object to the gigantic portion sizes because for most it is wasteful and encourages people to overeat. But there are a variety of options from decadent to responsible, and a lot in between."
"Although Grand Lux (GLC) is one of the more reasonable non-fast food restaurants to get a sandwich or salad on the strip, no sandwiches exist on the menu for $8.00 at GLC. With the exception of a small plain burger and BLT at $9.00 all other sandwiches are $10.50 to $15.00. With the average at about $11.50.At Wynn, Zoozacrackesr is about the same price range for sandwiches as GLC.STEdited: 8 years ago "
Isn't there a sandwich shop in IP?
