Should we be worried? Travelling to Singapore in 10 days. . .
"Singapore isnt in China, let alone Wuhan where said virus is active. We have as much chance of it coming to the UK with direct flights from the region."
"Yes I know Singapore isn't in China.But beens as China is roughly 5hrs on a plane to Singapore there is always a risk of spreading. Already there has been cases in Taiwan & ThailandI will take your word for itEdited: 3:24 pm, January 22, 2020 "
"Still early days. It's CNY this coming weekend, when China will experience the so-called biggest human migration on earth (hundreds of millions travelling home for the holidays). They also officially celebrate it the longest: i.e. the Spring Festival Golden Week, which falls on Jan 24 to Jan 30 this year. If the epidemic escalates, it'll be due to this context. China has started thermal screening, but the commuting is mainly land-based over there (railways) so the medical checks aren't as enclosed as at airports. I read that Wuhan has banned outbound tour-group trips, but otherwise can't stop individual travellers from leaving town &/or holidaying overseas.So far, there's no reports of those infected spreading the virus to fellow flight passengers yet, let alone affecting locals & tourists in foreign countries. As for Singapore, there has been 7 pneumonia cases from Wuhan between Jan 4 to Jan 21, but all tested negative for coronavirus & were not linked to the wholesale market cluster. (3 more were reported on Jan 22 & are undergoing tests.) As extra precaution, our authorities announced yesterday that we will be screening all travellers from China henceforth (not just from Wuhan), & will also isolate anyone from China with pneumonia symptoms.Odds are you should be okay as long as you're not flying from China to Singapore. We are also experienced with contact tracing & home quarantining after the 2003 SARS outbreak."
">>Yes I know Singapore isn't in China.<<I wasnt saying you didnt, that was a context statement to lead into the next one about where it could spread.The length of the flight isnt the issue but the routings and potential spread along them and how the current situation that it could go to the UK just as much as Singapore (cf the announced US case before either the UK or Singapore) affects your plans.By focussing on simple geographic closeness, ie the flight length, the risk analysis isnt done correctly. Its one thing to take a risk if staying home eliminated the risk, its a different equation if the risk (disease spread in this case) is avoided by staying home."

"There are no confirmed cases in Singapore yet. Even if there is, am confident the Singapore Government will do well to contain it. Singapore is amongst the most regulated and efficient in Asia. If you are still worried, wear a mask."
"Has the UK government or WHO issued a travel warning for Singapore? No, so you should not be worried.What did you do when SARs was about? That is is considered worse.Anyhow Wuhan has now locked down travel to/from there to reduce the chance of the virus spreading.Edited: 7:42 pm, January 22, 2020 "

Nice one. Looks like the only coronavirus I should worry about then is if I drink too much of it haI'm here all week
"It's important that we put this into perspective. The 'flu' here in Australia last year killed nearly 500 people and I'm sure that before it reached us, other countries suffered significant fatalities as well.Of course this virus may escalate, but each year new viruses are emerging because they mutate and develop into new strains.This doesn't stop people travelling and going about their normal business though.Edited: 12:58 am, January 23, 2020 "
Ha ha TravelAddict. Maybe you've stumbled on the cure. Relax and enjoy your trip!
Me too. ill be there tomorrow Jan 25 :(

Read on the news today that the virus has reached S'pore & Vietnam and few confirmed cases were reported at both these places yesterday. S'pore ministry of health issued statement to avoid crowded places. To be on safer side.. can wear mask.
"Well, Singapore has her first confirmed case. Here's the info linkhttps://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-…The rest are pending confirmation results and had been isolated"
Singapore's up tp 3 now. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapo…We are still waiting on the results of the first 14 suspects in the UK - while 5 are negative there are 9 outstanding currently. They learnt a lot from SARS and MERS in terms of control in the population and where to put your health teams for best effect.
"As of today, Singapore has 3 cases (all had travel history to Wuhan). Singapore has one of the best healthcare system in the world. If I were you, I won’t worry too much."
Just transited through Singapore. I felt like I was passing through a TB ward with all the hacking and coughing going on.
Serious? Haha! I Guess Thailand is safer
"Thailand has had two more cases confirmed at the moment than Singapore. I went through Bangkok during SARS and they had a pretty well-controlled health scanning regime in the airport then - medical teams, spot checks and thermal imaging of all passengers."

I am going Sunday via Japan on small rc cruise that goes to Malaysia and phuket. I am worried but trying to follow guidelines. I don't know what to do.
Me 2 leaving Sunday. Was so worried about long flight. Now I'm scared. Wanted to enjoy. My first time
"You could catch it in your home town, in your local shop...or anywhere close... or you could catch it in Singapore ..: it makes no difference where you are (apart for certain parts of China of course)"
I will be in Singapore next 7 Feb . Will stay 3 nights and then I have the flight to Perth. I am thinking to anticipate the flight to Perth ...
"Unless WHO or the Australian Government advises against air travel to Singapore, I wouldn’t stop myself from going. I think the key is good hygiene, as with any other virus. Washing hands frequently, not touching the face (especially nose/mouth), wearing a mask, avoiding livestock, avoiding heavily congested areas and so forth.Monitor the WHO website and Singapore’s Ministry of Health for updates and advice. If it’s not too late, book hotels and flights on a ‘flexible’ rate so you can change or cancel if need be. Taking out travel insurance is also always smart and essential.Safe travels!"
"Most travel insurances have exemptions for Pandemic events! Which travel insurances have no such clause? (it's not about getting the flight refunded - if you cannot depart the airline has to refund you, but not compensate your - it's about if during your trip the pandemic event gets upgraded and you can't return home normally. Which insurance will then still pay evacuation or hospital treatments?"
"i canceled my flight and hotels stay , i planed stay 12 days in Singapore between 31/1-12/2 but canceled every thing because they still dont know so much about this virus"
Bit dramatic in my opinion. 3 cases in Singapore last I saw all Chinese nationals with links to Wuhan
"In response to post 27,there are currently four confirmed cases in Singapore and four in Australia, so I don't see much difference between the two at the moment."
"Re: # 32, I wouldn't be so dismissive of the concern. We now know people with the virus are infectious during the incubation period, that is, they can transmit the illness even when they seem healthy. So expect a dramatic rise in the number of confirmed cases in the next few days and weeks. It's not yet panic time in Singapore, but caution is well advised.Edited: 3:33 pm, January 26, 2020 "
I just wanted to thank everyone for their calm and reasoned posts on this topic. My family has been planning our trip to Singapore for nearly a year and a mysterious new virus outbreak 3 weeks before we depart is concerning. The links and resources you have posted have been a big help as I research the issue. We have our fingers crossed that the number of cases in Singapore remains low and we can travel as planned.
Fingers crossed. Not long til I go and I’ll be travelling unless my company add it to our banned list
"Re 33, not being dismissive, and yes I agree we can expect a rise in number of cases. I said ""at the moment"" there was no difference between Singapore and Australia, which was what the poster was referring to. At the moment authorities are not aware of any transmission in Singapore - all cases to date are connected to China.Obviously everyone needs to make their own assessment of the risk, but at the moment here in Singapore I am not wearing a mask and have no particular concerns in going about in public."

"minxbaby, i'm sorry! Noted."
Im reconsidering my trip for mar 12.
"Maybe you can monitor the situation as it goes. I think the contact tracing in SG is done rather well. The risk is there but as long as no huge numbers, I think it is ok. Most have avoided travel unless necessary"
"I am traveling from KL to Singapore by bus tomorrow. I’ve tried a few pharmacies and drug stores in the main shopping malls here and they are all sold out of masks, some were sold out of hand sanitizer and thermometers! Not sure if it’s the same in Singapore? Hoping I can get my hands on a mask when I arrive. Was debating not traveling (my other half and I are backpacking so our plans are quite fluid). We’ll see what will happen in the next few days I suppose, hopefully we’ve made the right decision!"
"It's extremely difficult to buy masks in Singapore.If you do find a shop with masks in stock, expect long queues.RKL, if you can delay your visit without penalty it might be wise. The situation currently is under control, but it's anybody's guess what will happen in the next month.Medical treatment in Singapore is excellent, and nobody has died as yet here, but there is nothing which is available to help victims fight the infection."
"My girlfriend has ordered some masks online, hand gel, deet insect repellant and tissues so we are prepared. Now time to go enjoy my trip"
"No masks available in the US at the moment either - all stores and online shopping outlets are sold out. Was planning to buy some for our upcoming trip in two weeks... oh well, i'm not too worried about it."
I would be more worried about the couple from Chicago then Singapore
"Most shops have run out of masks and hand sanitisers. Your best best bet is to wash hands frequently with soap per WHO recommendations and avoid touching your face with your hands. Only those who are sick need to put on a mask to avoid spreading their germs to others. https:/…Edited: 2:28 am, January 31, 2020 "
I'll nip out to my local chemist to see if they have some masks left before I fly off tomorrow to Krabi and Singapore with a stopover at Doha - I have a couple of them already but better get a few more (if there are any left)
"I’m also concerned. My husband and I depart for Singapore and Cambodia March 4. At this point, I think in about 2-3 weeks we will make a final decision. My husband has an underlying health issue and that’s another concern. We travel to Sing and Cam every year, and all has gone well. But this is certainly something to really keep an eye on. So far, I’ve bought mask, sanitizers etc. But that may only be a mind thing. Anyway, please post and let me know if you go and how are things when you arrive! Travel safe!"
Use a bandana or a scarf.
"There’s 16 cases in Singapore. The country is only 250 sq. miles. I live In Houston, Texas. It’s over 600 sq miles. The entire USA has 6-7 cases. Wrap your head around that one."
"There were more people travelling between Wuhan and Singapore compared to Wuhan and the United States because of the relative proximity and the many direct flights.Edited: 9:25 pm, January 31, 2020 "
All the cases detected in Singapore thus far are imported cases (they contracted the virus while overseas).

"Barbara Kohn I would be concerned - very concerned. Many countries have stopped or in the process of stopping people from China entering BUT what about all those already there who have not self isolated ??Edited: 6:29 pm, February 04, 2020 "
"Here now. Most check tempreture when arriving in airports, hotels & bars. Seen alot of Chinese folks with masks on but apart from that seems pretty low key."
Thanks Travel Addict. I just read the UK is allowing Chinese to still enter the UK ! This is concerning to say the least.
"Hi TravelAddict, have you been wearing a mask? We’re due to fly over next Sunday, and still not too sure what to do. I’m more concerned as we’ll be with our Daughter, I was going to give it till Wednesday next week to make the call. We won the flights anyway, and Hotel to be paid when we arrive, so wouldn’t really loose out. Just the fact, it’s the trip of a lifetime, especially for our little girl."
"I haven't put it on once. Neither has any other tourists I have seen. Its mostly the Chinese folk who have been wearing them.There are hand sanitizers around Clarke Quay and in my hotel (not sure on other hotels) you can use to keep your hands clean, there is also a list in my room on what to do to keep germ free.I have been here since Monday and feel absoloutley fine.Edited: 4:45 am, February 05, 2020 "
"Cheers for the info TravelAddict, my heart is still saying go, I’ll see how things develop over the next week."
"Would be a shame for you to miss out. My first time here and its one of the best places i've been too. So clean, hot, plenty to do, friendly locals and great food. if it stays as it is still do it and go, thats my opinion anyways, its a great place."
"That’s our thinking too TravelAddict, don’t really want to miss out. As it seems such an amazing place, I just want to be certain little’n is going to be safe."
"We're flying in on the 15th as well. Speaking to our hotel to learn more about prevention measures in place helped me to feel better about our visit. They reported that everything is still open, but with temperature checks and extra cleaning in many venues. (The hotel and other tourist businesses we have booked with were also willing to move our bookings if we wanted, which I really appreciate). Fingers crossed that the virus remains under control. It seems like Singapore is doing all it can to ensure that."
"Singapore is relatively well prepared, as far as it is possible, further to having dealt with the SARS in 2003.There are precautions in place (isolated or quarantined people, some events cancelled) but other than that life is going on almost as normal. The central areas look quieter, some have even suggested it is the lack of Chinese tourists, I wouldn't think it would be that visible!The Singapore Ministry of Health advises that masks are to be worn IF showing symptoms, not as precaution. I guess some people feel safer that way so why not, but apparently it is not that necessary. I'd say roughly 1/4 of people I see wear masks, maybe less. I actually have seen a lot of tourist-looking/Western people wearing them.The main advice is to wash hands frequently. I'd bring hand sanythiser over if I was travelling as it is mostly sold out here. (I usually have it when travelling anyway, as it can be useful if eating around without a chance to wash hands. Incidentally, local food courts usually have a sink and soap for hands... regardless of the virus).Anyone who has been to China in the last 14 days has not been allowed in since last weekend. At the present moment, I wouldn't even think of cancelling a trip (unless I had pre-existing conditions etc.). If things get worse, then of course it needs consideration, but personally I am not making radical changes to my life until I'm told to panic by someone who understands the situation..."
Is Singapore only temp screening people coming from China or everyone?
"Anyone saying masks are not available, I ordered some on Amazon last week, not sure if it's now sold out. I had to buy a 3 pack. My husband is using one and I am using the other. Check amazon. Or if someone wants my extra mask, I can probably mail it to you."
"Temp screening all arriving flights. I arrived yesterday from Australia and they were temps screening our arrival and there were 10 staff there watching on.My plane which is usually full was not full, maybe 50 or 60% full.On the ground in Singapore I don't see as many people wearing masks as I thought there would be."
All flights? Wow.So what happens if you have a temp but you haven’t been in China?
"Not only at the airport are they taking temps but now at quite a lot of other places too. For instance the building I work in takes temperatures and makes you sign a declaration of recent travel history for any guests coning to the office.I would say now is a great time to come to Singapore, it's so much quieter, especially around the Bay.Friends were even telling me that you now don't have to queue at Shake Shack or A&W at The Jewel. Now that's quiet!!!At a rough estimate I would say there's about 50% less people than usual.Edited: 8:01 pm, February 05, 2020 "
I'm liking this map overview of where the cases in Singapore have been...https://sgwuhan.xose.net/
">>So what happens if you have a temp but you haven’t been in China<<They check why you have a temperature. This particular coronavirus might be in the news and growing in caseload but its not the only infection out there. Just because you haven't apparently been in China (dual nationals can easily slip through that crack) doesn't preclude having a similar thing (or indeed the same thing if you were say a medical staffer in a hospital that treated a case but they don't know that) - its just not financially viable to do this sort of screening on a regular basis, so places only do it when there is enough reason to."
"I would strongly suggest any visitors to Singapore to delay. I’m working in Singapore. I told my friends and family from UK and US NOT to visit and they all cancelled their plans. I’m basically living in self quarantine1. Entire office were all told to go work from home for next 2 weeks as of yesterday. Fairly big size Co. No business travel as of last week. 2. From having only 1 case (Jan 23?) Singapore is now the 3rd highest number of cases in the world at 28 and rising.. 3. Singapore is the smallest country to be affected, very densely populated, hence virus spread human to human very high risk. You need to wait it out."
Wise move !
"Bill, you're been a bit sensationalist there. Care to state the reasoning why? Was somebody in your company diagnosed as having the virus?Have you put yourself in self quarantine as you know you may be an ""at risk""?This does not sound typical of the situation here at all..."
"Geez Bill, way to make everyone panic."
I'm staying in Chinatown. Is it more risky than other places? Should I change my hotel
"Superdry - wherever you are in Singapore, you can rest assured that all measures are being taken on the hygiene front. May as well stay where you are. Little_Wong - someone from my team infected. I’m in self quarantine. Not typical. Given the predicted growth of the virus, felt justified in dissuading loved ones from UK and US to come visit as planned this month.MellyColly - there’s no need to panic, that doesn’t help anyone, and I’m sorry if that came across as adding to the unwanted hysteria. Stay safe!"
">>someone from my team infected. I’m in self quarantine.<<Thanks for getting back on this and clearing things up. Sorry to hear the situation you're in. Very unfortunate. Hope you'll be OK.As obviously you've been potentially exposed your advice to loved ones not to come to visit you is a sensible one.Edited: 7:55 pm, February 06, 2020 "
I just arrived in Singapore this morning. It was a pretty full plane on flight United #1 from SFO to Singapore. I saw maybe 10-15 percent of the people wearing masks in Singapore. Almost exclusively Asians. I was originally scheduled to fly through CHENGDU but United cancelled the flight last Friday. They indicated that they were working on an alternative plan but I didn't wait for them to change my flights. I called them this past Saturday and got switched to the direct flight from San Francisco.When we reached passport control they did pull us aside and asked if we had flown through China. They did the same for maybe a half dozen other travelers that I saw. We showed them the boarding passes from SFO but they were still a bit suspicious. I do not know if they had any knowledge of our earlier itinerary which would have taken us through CHENGDU. The delay took about ten-fifteen minutes.We saw an area where passengers could have their temperatures taken if they had been in China for the past 14 days but it appeared to be voluntary. I did not see many people waiting to do this.Our plan is to spend a few days in Singapore before traveling to Bali for a week then ending our trip with two weeks in western Australia and Victoria.We are certainly aware of the health concerns and are being very vigilant about washing our hands and using antiseptic wipes. I suppose we might be taking a risk in going on this trip but are not overly concerned. We are very seasoned travelers and this is not the first time we have traveled under less than ideal conditions. I will report back if there is anything of note happening during my trip but for now the plan is to enjoy ourselves and keep our itinerary intact.
"Feb 7: China cases now growing at 10% a day, cases now 31kSingapore is not China. Not at epicentre. No evidence of community spread. Hence “safe” with sensible hygiene, but cases continue to grow, numbers not yet worrying, but growth trend is. Singapore 30 confirmed cases nowAnother flight from Wuhan planned to repatriate Singaporeans from epicentre https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/healt…Measures placed in schools often later become measures placed in society. Social distancing measures implemented at schools in Singapore (new for Feb 6) - precautionary. “The announcement on 4 February by MOH of a few cases with no travel history to China marked a new phase of local transmission.Hence, MOE decided to stop mass events in schools like assemblies and camps. Given that there is no evidence of community spread as yet, there is no need to stop mass events but we are taking precautions for vulnerable groups, such as pre-schools and school children.”https:/…faqs-wuhan-coronavirus-infection"
"FromComfort, Western Australia currently has no confirmed cases here yet, neither does Bali. Enjoy your trip!"
I went January 26 came back. Feb 4. Singapore safe. People wear mask as i did anf everyone hyperviglante.
"3 rd confirmed case in UK is from Singapore, I don't know his travel history etc."
"I'm in Singapore. I am a seasoned traveller. I am trying to put myself in a visitor's shoes to decide if I would come to Singapore if I were him/her.From the information provided by media, it seems really worrying. Based solely on the information from the media, I would consider carefully to cancel my trip. If I'm with young kids or the elderly, I will definitely cancel the trip. From my own on-site observations, I would say that people are vigilant (a sneeze will draw immediate glances) and avoiding crowds. Temperature checks are in place before entry into most office buildings. Leave of absence and strict quarantine laws are also implemented for those who may have prior exposure/higher risks. On the streets, everything seems normal. I honestly wouldn't know that Singapore is ranked 3rd in terms of numbers of people infected (currently 30 cases now) if I look around. Other than more people wearing masks (maybe 1 in 10?) and lesser crowds in public places (which is great for attractions!), life here seems to be normal. Do consider carefully before you decide to cancel your trip. If you're already here, maintain good hygiene like washing hands with soap more often, and enjoy yourself and the sun here! :)"
I notice alot of people have mentioned to avoid Singapore if you have kids/young kids. But ive also read that the virus is infecting only a few children. I wonder why that is?
"Mellycolly, I guess as a parent, I tend to be more protective towards children who have an immune system that may not be as strong as an adult."
Yeah mate im not questioning why people are avoiding taking their kids on such holidays (im a mum of 3 i get it) I was just wondering why the virus is targeting mostly adults
I'm traveling over next Friday the 15th then on to sydney for my daughters wedding should I be worried that I wont be allowed entry in to australia
">>should I be worried that I wont be allowed entry in to australia<<Only if Australia decides to put a travel restriction on those travelling via Singapore, but they have not, so there's nothing to worry about"
"Mellycolly, I guess it's mainly because the adults are more mobile and interact daily with more people? Children only get to mingle with their classmates and parents. If children get to go drinking in pubs after school, maybe there'll be higher chance of infection? :D :P"
Thankyou just worried especially with it being my daughters wedding
">>I was just wondering why the virus is targeting mostly adults<<Two options leap to mind. Fost, those affected are an older group where the innate immune pathways are waning compared to kids and if said innate immune system is the part of the whole immune system is a significant part of protection from the virus then you'd see a skew like this.Another options there is an element of immunopathology generated crossreactivity with other previous types of coronavirus infection (dengue works the same way) and again, older people will have seen more and so have seen the antigen that isn't helpful in this virus.There's more possibilities for sure, including sociological options meaning the kids aren't seeing so much virus - but those two biological ones above are two easy to go to explanations as to the skew seen to mild disease in kids.Basically, what I'm saying is there are plenty of non-weird ways of explaining this."
"xxxsamxxx, if Australia starts to forbid Japanese/people who have been to Japan from entering Australia, then you might have to worry about your transit in Singapore. Japan has more than twice as many infected. So nothing to worry about! :D Have fun at your daughter's wedding, and Congratulations! :)"
What intrigues me is I would be interested to know if this virus (like hepatitis) is still contageous after recovery and symptoms are no longer present.Who knows

Which hepatitis virus are you comparing to? The short answer is probsbly 'No' but the long answer will vsry depending upon what kind of persistence you are looking at and that is variable depending upon the Hepatitis virus in question as they come from hugely variable virus families. Their names are based on the ofgan they hit not their genetics.
"Appreciate the replies guys, makes sense"
Singapore has raised the DORSCON level to Orangehttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coron…
"3 more infected, without any links to China visitors or existing cases. I would be more cautious now. Keep yourselves updated on the news."
Thats my great concern that this virus can be spread before symptoms are evident and also after recovery and exhibiting no continueing signsVery worrying if Changi is closed
"Apparently face masks are all but useless: N95 or N100 style paint and sanding masks (typically recommended by the authorities) will NOT stop a Coronavirus, because these viruses are 125 nanometers in size (too small for these masks to stop)."
"Maybe we should be more concerned that, with this particular virus, your immune system is damaged so badly that you can easily be re-infected and spread the contagion again. Also, after a second infection, i wonder what the scarring on your lungs will look like."
"Singapore, like Japan, is just beginning the upward spiral the virus has taken in Wuhan. The Wuhan epidemic started with just a single case (there is almost no doubt about this); so in six weeks' time, we should expect 30,000 cases in SG. Why do people think that ""super vigilence"" and ""quarantining"" will stop a virus smaller than 125 nanometers (invisible) from spreading?"
"You ought to mention that Singapore also has a population consisting by law of 75% ethnic Chinese, a huge percentage of whom travel VERY frequently to Southeast Asia and Mainland China, Malaysia and Indonesia, where they are in close contact with other Chinese: there is NO other country where the population is so heavily Chinese, has extensive wealth to travel and is practically landlocked, except perhaps China itself."
"Singapore is pretty cool but it also has its dark side like any other country. I lived there for ten years; if you can obtain permission to live and work in SG it definitely is an advantage, since it's a lovely gateway to the Far East."
"My trip was cancelled today. Company banned travel to SG and also banned travel out of SG for those based there as we have offices thereEdited: 12:23 pm, February 07, 2020 "
We are arriving on 20th feb for 4 days can anyone tell me if it is safe to go to tourist sites and orchad ect or should we stay in out hotel room for 4 days?

If you’re coming alone or required by work, and cannot change, come but exercise caution. Stay safe!Edited: 12:12 am, February 08, 2020 "
"Diverjoc, about noticing more coughing - I hope you are safe. I wonder if now that I know about this virus, now that it is daily on my mind, now that I’m more vigilant and careful, that even I notice more coughing than normal, and perhaps it isn’t any more than normal, but only because I’m now “tuned” to avoid it? Someone coughs I walk around them not past them, someone sneezes, I do the same, I avoid. Most of this is probably misplaced and due to fear. However it is understandable.Edited: 12:27 am, February 08, 2020 "
"We now have large companies deciding to avoid Singapore for now.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapo…""Following the Singapore Ministry of Health's Feb 7 declaration of a Code Orange health alert, we consulted with the US government and our medical teams and decided not to participate in the Singapore Airshow,"" the company said in a statement.""We determined this was in the best interest of our employees and aligned with the US Department of Defense's decision to reduce its presence,"" From this piece it appears the “social distancing” measures already in place in schools are also being put into place by authorities at large public events “ The airshow will continue next week, but organisers might look to limit public visitors, Singapore said on Friday, as the country reported three more coronavirus cases that authorities have not yet linked to previous infections or travel to China.”Either it’s fear based or credible. We won’t know until later, but we know whats happening is on a bigger scale in Singapore society."
"Im not sure if you are trying to stop people from going or just really concerned for our safety.I'm not saying that people are guaranteed to be safe, you still need to be cautious.All I'm trying to say that it is not a crisis or warzone in Singaporw that is all."
"I don't consider myself a paranoid person at all and to be honest I've been known to push myself to limits on occasion, but I have a trip planned in early April and I'm going to postpone. It's still two months away, but as a teacher, I don't want to be one of those unlucky ones who comes back from spring break with the virus, potentially unknown for two weeks (incubation period) and then find out I have it and have exposed all my students, fellow teachers, etc. to it. Too many factors involved for me. It's better to eat the change cost and move my trip to summer. It's not worth it at this time. I still plan on visiting Singapore and Bangkok, but I just think it's better to play it safe.Edited: 1:30 am, February 08, 2020 "
"Like, seriously.. it is not a war zone.I understand a teacher's point of view of not taking risks, fair enough.But my experience as someone working in Singapore is different from the one posted above.My office has not made any changes yet. We have a plan to split into two teams if required, with one team working from home - so if anyone is affected they would only affect whoever is in the office that day.To date, we have not been told this will be implemented, but it's ready. I was out all day today and everything looked normal. Less people wearing masks than a week or two ago. Not noticed any higher amount of people coughing/sneezing.Who knows how it will develop but I am basically making it my mission to tell people abroad that things are relatively normal, as it seems that from the media people think that we're all dying or something."
"Dear Mmmm19,Thankfully, you’re right. Not one casualty yet. Let’s hope that may continue. However, I remain alarmed by the growth rate not being reduced. When it is, and the numbers contained, the hysteria you are seeing now, will just go away. For now though, perhaps it’s better to err on the side of caution."
Yes. China is now asking courts to murder patients. https:/…
"I'd say yes now in light of the fact that Singapore has just raised their Code Level from Green, Yellow and latest is Orange (one level below red). This has been done because they have 4 new cases of people who haven't been in China and this has been transmitted from person to person locally.We are due to go to Singapore this Friday but in light of this latest code level Orange issued by Singapore themselves we are definitely rethinking and most likely will not go. Bummer!!! my case is packed and I want to go but is it worth the risk. Hopefully we can reschedule the hotel and defer the flight and not lose money. If we do lose money it will be on the flights (a $300 pp fee) one has to weigh up what are the risks and how much do you value your health."
"So far there have been no travel waivers put in place for flights to/from Singapore. Singapore Airlines is not offering any changes/refunds to bookings and a majority of hotels are not either.... so either the situation isn't as serious as some on this board claim or businesses are valuing their profits over safety. I think if we see waivers start to be issued in the coming days at that point one should rethink travelling....Edited: 5:56 pm, February 08, 2020 "
"I think we should not forget that there is a massive gap in orange and red level and the virus did not originate in Singapore. Any travel ban or refunds are unlikely before it happens in Japan as Japan is still ahead of Singapore in number of cases. I'm landing on the 12th Feb and staying there for three days. With panic created by some people in this forum, we won't be able to enjoy our trip."
"Dear Superdry,With basic hygiene and sensible caution you should be ok. Singapore is an amazing place and i have been blessed to work here past 3 years. You are only here 3 days. Make the most of it. As of now USS is not closed. This is a good sign in itself."

Thank you for the update. I just decided to avoid Singapore as my transit although I intend to travel on April
"Malan, by April, DORSCON, the only recognised standard for the threat of Coronavirus in Singapore, might be green. Good luck and safe travels."
I think the most concerning part is that there is (up to) a 14 day incubation period. i.e. you can be walking around with it and not exhibit symptoms up to 2 weeks later. Much different from other communicable diseases and viruses.Heading there on 18-Feb. I will have my mask and hand sanitizer readily available.
Wow. Astonishing hysteria.I may have to check my schedule and see how many times I might be good to book for Singapore in the near future; the next few months or more.Already I've seen a 25% discount on rooms at a frequent haunt of mine in Chinatown.I'll also wait for last minute booking of a flight; should be serious discounts.This is too good to be true ...
BuckCRNA ignore the hysterical remark. Your steps taken are sensible. Happy travels.
Any discounts in flight or hotels are likely to be eaten up in extra health/ travel insurance premiums.
"For what it's worth, as a foreign traveller following all the news with this virus, I believe that Singapore is doing the right thing. Following high standards of testing, contact tracing, reporting and being forthright with its citizens. I cannot say the same for all affected Asian countries. It is my opinion that if every country tested and reported to similar high standards, that the world incidence chart would be much different. This is why out of all the major Asian countries to visit in the near future, I would chose Singapore followed by Japan.Sending continued resilience and hope to all Singaporeans!Edited: 10:09 am, February 10, 2020 "

"""Any discounts in flight or hotels are likely to be eaten up in extra health/ travel insurance premiums.""I wouldn't know why. My health insurance premiums are paid by my employer. And why would they be all of a sudden paying higher premiums owing to some virus originating in China? I work in a different country.And you want to read your travel insurance document carefully before purchasing. For example, some people believe that 'flight cancellation insurance' covers 'flight cancellation.' I don't buy it; there isn't much reason to."
Is there any extra scrutiny for travellers from Singapore in USA?
Only if there is proof that they have been to China in the period before going to Singapore. No restrictions on Sing nationals.
">>Is there any extra scrutiny for travellers from Singapore in USA?<<My wife flew into SFO last week and spent 3 hrs queuing at immigration. They were questioning everybody, so even at the APC kiosks everybody got the ""X""."
"I've just come back from Singapore just a couple of hours ago after spending 3 days there, and I'm feeling fine - just a little jetlagged. Either do the following:(a) Just cancel the holiday if you really have concerns regarding the spread of the virus - in the end of the day your safety is the priority over losing money over a holiday that you have paid forOR(b) Go on holiday, wear face masks where its needed (I put it on at airports, inside the plane while travelling to and from there, or using the metro or in crowded areas - there were times when I didn't use the mask while in Singapore.

"#122, that is fake news. Please do some fact-checking first before you pass on such news in future.https://factcheck.afp.com/hoax-report-claims…"
"In response to 122, we just rescheduled our trip, which was to start next week. So far 3 out of 4 hotels waived cancellation fees. Airlines have not responded, but I suspect they are deluged with all the flights to China that have been canceled. I am not sure I would read the willingness to issue waivers as some indication of the severity of the situation. I think it's more an indication of how much the various hotels value preserving a customer relationship over short term profits. Certainly I will think twice about booking at a Shangri-La property in the future given that they are the only hotel that hasn't been willing to work with me to rebook.We are very sad to postpone our trip, but I would have difficulty enjoying myself given how little is known about the virus at this point."

I planned the trip to singapore and malaezia in March 5th but tend to cancel it . How did you contact the hotels to vaived the cancelation fee? Did you get credit ? Thank you
"Nick, I emailed because that's easiest for me given the time difference. The response depended on the hotel. 1 said no problem and issued the refund. 2 said no initially, but reconsidered when I asked again. 1 has refused to refund any of my money thus far. (Our trip included Singapore and Malaysia, so my issue is with a Shangri-La in Malaysia). I would say don't take no for an answer and politely ask for the request to be escalated to management if necessary."
"I think the hotels who are giving refunds or allowing change of visit are to be commended. Their actions may well help speed up an end to this virus by lessening contact. Longer term, visitor will return to those hotels who have dont the right thing by their clientsSingapore Airlines on the other hand are a different story, we will never fly with them again. The risk may be low but we simply didnt want to take the risk of sitting on a long haul flight for many hours not knowing who else was on board or if they had been exposed to the virus."
"Hi RetiredMelbourne,On another thread for this topic a woman said she was able to get a refund on non refundable airline tickets from Singapore airlines. She said she booked through some third party TA type arrangement (not one I'd heard of) and once she'd spoken to the airlines she got them to follow up. Have a browse through the other threads. I will see if I can find it. We are in a similar position with non refundable tickets to Seoul in early April, via Singapore and our daughter and husband were planning a 5 day holiday in Singapore on the way back from Seoul (so late April). We are playing a bit of a waiting game at the moment as my husband and I are flying on to France after Seoul, transiting back through Singapore so not actually staying in Singapore. I'm more concerned about the plane travel, however, I always worry about getting sick from plane travel and a friend was sneezed over most grossly last year and then got the flu badly so it is not just about the corona virus."
"Hi RetiredMelbourne, what steps have you taken to get a refund? From other threads SA seem to be playing quite reasonably about issuing refunds."
"Easy access to rides at adventure cove waterpark. Screening is in place to check for any signs of the virus. Taxis are struggling to make any money due to lack of tourists according to one driver, and park regis hotel bookings are down due to this virus.A real shame as i'm having a great time, just clean your hands with sanitiser and water more than you should is the best advice. Really is a great time to visit due to the lack of crowds, off to Tanjong Beach before the rain comes again. Fly home on Friday, its been a blast!"

"Another person has posted about getting a refund. Here is what she said (Melbourne based).I had purchased the non-refundable ticket in August 2019. I was able tot get a full refund through calling 13 10 11 (I live in Melbourne, Australia) and I discussed with the representatives that I did not feel safe travelling to Singapore during this time as it was going to be hard to predict what was going to happen. I was monitoring the situation over there for at least a week were it rose from 14 cases to 45 within a 4 day period. I had to send in a screenshot on SIngapore's Ministry of Health stating that the DORSCON level is at orange and I also discussed how Qatar, Kuwait and the UK are suggesting to avoid any unnecessary travel to Singapore if possible.They had sent all this information to the escalation team within 2 days and we were able to get the full refund which I'm very thankful they were able to do despite us getting the non-refundable ticket!"
"However, she then posted again saying her tickets are cancelled but the escalation team hasn't dealt with her case yet and no refund but a bit unrealistic to expect immediate refund as another poster pointed out. Just check the other corona virus threads for these examples."
@TA did you go to any hawker centers?

"Wow Traveladdict, sounds brilliant!"

Yes very busy
"Just wanted to provide a quick update on my efforts to cancel my trip. Shangri La relented today and agreed to refund my room cost. It took 5 plus emails, including one in which I mentioned reaching out to our local consumer affairs reporter to bring publicity to the situation. (I do think the lack of recourse in this type of situation is newsworthy). So kudos to Fullerton, the Mandarin, Sukau Rainforest Lodge and Shangri La for their willingness to help us reschedule our trip. I am currently on hold with Singapore Airlines."
"Jess kudos to you too!For your persistence when so many would have just given up. You're super tenacious! This will actually help others who are in the process of doing the same. Thank you for providing those steps, i am sure they will be appreciated by others.Bill"
I've a flight with Qatar Airways to Bangkok tomorrow and return from Singapore booked with an online travel agent (E....) but even arguing with the topic that Qatar state advise to avoid to travel to Singapore... I'm unable to get a complete refund :(
"Which online agent, do you mean the dreadful Edreams? If you booked a cheap non-refundable ticket on Edreams or whoever E..... is then you would not likely get a full refund just because an airline customer service person advised you not to travel to Singapore. Was the flight actually cancelled by Qatar?"
"Hello Avanti,Expedia, flight has not been cancelled,It is stated by Qatar government, in my opinion this makes no sense.https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-ea…"
"If the flight is cancelled by the airline then you are more likely to get a refund.If it’s your choice to cancel it and it’s a non-refundable flight booking then you should not expect a full refund.

Thank you Jess . I reached Marina BAY Sand and they propose me to amend the dates . Other hotel I contacted : The Face Suites in Malaysia did not cancel due to the fact that I booked through AIR MILES HUB . I did propose them to amend the dates . Will see if possible . I do have 2 more hotels to contact . At this point my decision to cancel my trip is 100 % .
"Wanderer_Dani,Looks like the answers you got on Air Travel forum so far from a few experienced regular forum posters there confirmed/echoed what I thought. You should not expect a refund as your flight has not been cancelled.Some mentioned Travel Insurance. Do you have a Travel Insurance policy covering this trip?"

"I think it is unfair to shortlist only BillUK32 for criticism. Is it that repetitive messages by only one person are not permitted, whereas it is perfectly ok for 50 members to post almost exactly the same query in a short time span as is happening on this forum for the past few days? Does TA have no rules to prevent this? BillUK32 may have violated a forum rule but is he not doing this with good intention? I feel the first target of criticism ought to be all those who are posting the same queries without bothering to read the many threads on same topic that are already running? Secondly, the rule of repetitive messages should not be applied blindly. There are merits in repeating message with important content because information posted 5 days ago may not be easily accessible to those who have similar query today because the older messages will be buried under new ones. Application of the rule related to repetitive messages ought to be made judiciously looking at the contents of the message."
"MRahul, there is no easy answer to this. From past experience, there will always be new members who do not browse through the existing threads before posting.

"Instead of reporting SPAM or complaining- as suggested - lets make it a STICKY. Much like a plane's safety video for every flight.I do not work in travel industry. I have nothing to gain here. I care about personal safety first.Perhaps consider that if one single person new to Singapore,is helped by it, avoids danger, decreases risk of communal spread by watching a Government distributed video, then you are doing your (tripadvisor) community a greater service than complaining about seeing the same video linked in multiple threads.I say, lets make the Gov.Sg video and any useful newcomer resources into a sticky.This will ensure no future ""SPAM"" needed.

">>If they work in travel industry and don’t want sticky ok, just say so.<<Oh no, it’s not related to that at all. This is an open forum so I’m just saying some members may have a different opinion. I’ll check with my fellow DEs on the process and get back to you."

User says Thank you.3. User is a newcomer to Sg. There is a Gov.Sg video for newcomers and Singaporeans to reduce communal spread4. We are at 3rd highest DORSCON rating, with unique measures not present in other countriesNewcomer was made aware of above. If you’re calling this spam, ok buon san Valentino. Thank youEdited: 11:16 am, February 13, 2020 "
Can someone please direct me to where I can keep an eye on the travel restrictions? Australia has just extended ours for another week. I’m wondering if Singapore was going to review theirs soon. Travelling in 2 weeks and would definitely cancel if the travel restrictions for China in Singapore are lifted. Thanks
Are you going to Singapore for a holiday or transiting via Singapore? I'd be interested in views on transiting in Singapore for Europe. I'm not worried about being in Europe in April (although we are going to SK first for our son's wedding). This issue is transit through Singapore. I wish we'd booked a flight direct from Sydney to Seoul now and then to Europe via Dubai. Rationally I know that it is unlikely to contract the virus whilst in the airport and maybe even on the plane if passengers are not from mainland China. I'd love to know how many travellers to and via Singapore are cancelling or rescheduling.
@Blouncy I presume you are asking about travel restrictions INTO Singapore due to the coronavirus. Here’s some information from the Singapore Immigration website:https:/…updates-on-border-control-measures
"Post #202 is not directed towards you, Minxbaby"
"Yes that’s correct. Thank you, I will keep my eye on that site as well. I don’t have to make a decision for another week."
"Re # 212. Newcomer didn't ask for advice on the virus. No, I didn't notice you had previously replied because it was on a different subject matter. I hope you are not like this in real life...And yes, unique measures also due to unique resources. I see extreme precaution here and I am not complaining, it doesn't mean we are all about to die but that we need to keep things in control to avoid further spread and catch sick people/spreaders early for their own sake and other people's sake.Edited: 12:56 am, February 14, 2020 "
I am in a similar position to you but the other way around. We are transiting Singapore to Sydney from the UK in April. I am not concerned about getting the virus as the risk is low and I know there are measures being taken to contain it. I am more worried about either the UK restricting travel to/via Singapore or Australia saying anyone transiting Singapore cannot enter and we have to cancel our trip altogether...….just have to keep our eye on it I guess. If this does happen I hope the airlines will have to issue refunds and can then look at rebooking flights via Dubai/Doha

"""Singapore government’s approach of actively weeding out those affected could explain its relatively high number of cases...Singapore was detecting more cases because it gave an incentive for citizens to come forward when they were unwell, and citizens in general trusted the government...developed nations tended to have better detection – and reporting – of cases, more “sophisticated” contact tracing, and a wider availability of test kits...It is not just because the culture of transparency is stronger and motivation for learning higher, but the resources that can be invested in tracking events.”https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-enviro…"
Was it easy for your to cancel? Did they charge you extra?
"Hi Retired Melbourne, sorry, I haven't been keeping up with all the posts. It gets a bit overwhelming. We are flying into Singapore on 6th April and then directly on to SK, then two weeks later back via Singapore and on to France. Our daughter, husband and 2 children may or may not be coming as planned. They were going to be staying for 5 nights in Singapore from 22nd April, on the way back from SK."
"Personally I wouldn't cancel the trip to Singapore unless we have over 1000s of people infected with the virus. I guess some people are different or more cautious so I understand the concern regarding this. I was there between 7th and 10 Feb, and I came back to the UK dancing like Wayne Sleep LOL...basically came back home fit as a fiddle"

"I think when I was there, there were 40 cases that I read but it didn't faze me - and my hotel was very close to Chinatown. You are more likely to get Dengue Fever or Zika virus if you were bitten by mozzies. For people who have booked the vacation to Singapore, just monitor the situation daily and then decide whether you feel confident to go or just cancel the holiday if it worries you - yes the money is lost but health is more important. I've seen many British tourists in Singapore while I was there and it didn't concern them too much.If people are really worried about this, then just cancel it - safety comes firstEdited: 4:43 pm, February 17, 2020 "
"Yes, I think if the worry of being vigilant with children whilst wandering around Singapore for 5 days is too stressful it is best to cancel. It might be possible for my daughter and family to cancel the stay in Singapore (I think non-refundable airbnb but could ask for a refund and see what happens) and either pay for a flight change or ask SA if they would waive the fee for the change, which they might do given the family is not asking to cancel with a refund. SA still get their money for the flights and simply have to move a flight from 28 April back to 22nd to give them a connecting flight to Perth from SK. But my daughter might not want to even go to SK, she seems so concerned about what might happen if there is quarantine for anyone who has been to Singapore etc etc. But for now she is waiting it out to see what happens. We will see."
People often compare dengue risk with corona virus. I don't think it is quite correct to do so as dengue virus transmitters (mosquitoes) can be identified and spotted more easily than corona virus carriers (human beings). It is easier to mitigate dengue risk by avoiding areas which are likely to have mosquitoes or there are means to keep mosquitoes away from you. Mitigating corona virus risk is much more difficult. Hence its not really correct to give example of dengue to counter people's concerns with regards to corona virus.

"Michelle, is your daughter aware that Airbnb rentals of less than 3 months duration is illegal in Singapore? This goes for private apartments rented through Booking com, Hotels com, Tripadvisor, etc., as well.Your daughter could turn up at the apartment and find herself either shut out, or the subject of unpleasantness from other apartment owners who decide to dob their neighbor in for renting out their apartment illegally.If the owner was reported to the authorities, they face stiff penalties.There is lots of information regarding this on this Forum.In saying that though, it could be a way out for her if she contacts the owner and says that she's just become aware that they are renting illegally, and she therefore requires a refund.The owner would possibly be afraid that your daughter would report them to the authorities.Edited: 9:49 pm, February 17, 2020 "
"Covid-19 and dengue are very relevant examples to compare IMO for risk assessment.Yes, with dengue you know the risk levels and where the clusters are but even with this information there still were 388 cases last week. That is high.Of the latest covid-19 cases these are all from known clusters. It would appear that Singapore's actions are working by identifying those who have been at risk and constantly monitoring them and all that are here.Covid-19 on the surface appears to be subsiding in Singapore or at least it would appear the measure are working.Risk of dengue would always be there but the risk of covid-19 I see will reduce as time passes...I will repeat my feelings that I feel safer here in Singapore than I would if I were back in the UK. This is all because Singapore are making significant effort to identify those who could be infected and carriers.Whilst the UK still allows somebody to travel from China only last week and to have them out in the wild e.g. catching a grab and going to the main A&E at a hospital, something isn't as controlled as it can be.It's all about the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns and Singapore are trying to find all the known unkwowns e.g the people who could have the virus.I personally still classify catching covid-19 as low risk and if i did I'm not overly worried as I'm healthy and have no underlying medical issues."
I am in the similar situation. Traveling with kids to Singapore towards the end of March. I am fighting with my travel agent (Chase) to cancel my trip. Unfortunately/fortunately they are also my travel insurance which I have through a premium credit card. I am not sure what should be done at this point as I am going into Singapore via Singapore airlines and planning to return to the US via Qatar airways. None of them have declared a policy on this. I have a non refundable ticket with these airlines and so far they have not agreed to change the policy

"Hi TravelAddict,I think that the Zika Virus generally only causes mild symptoms for most people. However it is thought that it can cause problems for the unborn child, so pregnant women and those planning to become pregnant are warned to be vigilant.Dengue, in my opinion, seems to be more dangerous for the general population and I'm always careful not to leave my hotel room without mosquito repellent on.Good that you still have a sense of humor though. I think a sense of humor (even dry humor lol), when there's so much to worry about these days, goes a long way to lightening the atmosphere.I hope that you had a great holiday and that you're over your jetlag."
"Yes agree it goes a long way, lifes to short. Thanks for the comments"
"Was everyone aware that Harvard gave Singapore a Gold Standard for Covid 19 detection? Just to put this into context: “... According to the latest research, almost three times more cases of the Covid-19 virus could have been found globally if the rest of the world possessed the same “gold standard” detection capability as Singapore.”https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coron…https:/…This is stunning praise. If we partner this with our increased vigilance and social adaption per Dorscon Orange measures, we can give this Covid 19 monster a real beating!"
"No I assume she and her husband are not aware that Airbnb for less than 3 months is illegal. I didn't know either but I have never looked for this type of accommodation in Singapore, we've stayed in hotels. I will tell her. But there are plenty advertised on the airbnb platform. I wonder if it is the same for Seoul as we have booked an apartment there for 10 days through airbnb."
"Michelle, every single AirBNB advertised accommodation booked for less than 3 months, is illegal in Singapore. As Susan D, very sharply points out in #238:""If the owner was reported to the authorities, they face stiff penalties....In saying that though, it could be a way out for her if she contacts the owner and says that she's just become aware that they are renting illegally, and she therefore requires a refund.

"I've recently been to Singapore around 2 weeks ago for 3 days and I'm back in England now - I feel fine at the moment since I've come back.Again it is down to the individual whether they want to travel there or not during this time. Personally it didn't stop me from going and I'm glad I didn't cancel.....and I was staying close to Chinatown!!.I did wear a mask sometimes in crowded areas (even though it wasn't really that crowded) and travelling on MRT but there were other times when I didn't. I used actibacterial liquids frequently and washed my hands regularly. I think I didn't wear a mask while doing Gardens By The Bay, going to Merlion Park, Sky Park top of Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Botanic Gardens and Bugis where Sultan Mosque is located but I think I wore it around Orchard Road thoughEdited: 3:51 am, February 21, 2020 "
>>I used actibacterial liquids frequently <<Antibacterial liquids don't kill virus! Alcohol based sanitizers are the ones that are recommended.
"Also, by all accounts masks are of no consequence in preventing a healthy person contracting the virus ...I don't doubt, however, that it would be prudent to try to avoid people who are coughing and sneezing. As we all usually do.Nice that things seem to be settling down in Singapore, The SGD is taking a bit of a hit however. Still, it was even lower in Spring 2017 and recovered just fine ...Edited: 5:12 am, February 21, 2020 "
"Even if you get home from Singapore, don't immediately quit your hygiene and monitoring....You've heard about the guy from Brighton, who was in Singapore, drinking, eating, doing it all, feeling fine, then he goes to for a bit of Skiing to Geneva, infects 4 people including a boy of 11, still showing no symptoms he flies back to Brighton and goes to his pub, infects another 7 people on the way, then a few days later he starts showing symptoms and gets tested himself.He caused nearly 100 people to get tested or quarantined, infected 11 others, and all along the while he was in Singapore - happy as Larry. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-799…Morale of the tale - dont quit monitoring yourself, upping your hygenie even when you get home!

If they do cancel, they may lose the money that they paid for the holiday but your health is your wealth as you know the virus is stealth. I would check for updated reports on the situation and just assess it from there. While I was there, I did see many of our compatriots all around the city and they seemed pretty unfazed by it all"
"I feel that when the warning went to Orange, a lot of Singaporeans reduced their outdoors activity.However over the last few days, things do seem to be returning to normal.We were in Vivocity last night, and the decking was really busy.There is a serious reduction in the number of overseas visitors.But as always I stress other people's risk assessment can be wildly incorrect, so we must do our own research and decide for ourselves."
"Singapore located at tropical countries near Indonesia.Not in China, any worry?"
"Albert, not sure what you are referring to, but you could also say Singapore is quite close to the Epicentre WUHAN (Ground Zero). Yet if you look at the facts.As of today - zero new cases. Singapore has got a hold on the spread of the virus within Singapore for now, even while the rest of the world, South Korea, Italy and others are being overwhelmed. Thus Singapore being close to any country - it doesnt really matter so long as the local containment continues to its current very brilliant standard!"

"ccC00kie, re#267, not sure if you read this:https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coron…Its basically a world class endorsement of Singapore as the Gold Standard for Covid 19 detection (and containment).
