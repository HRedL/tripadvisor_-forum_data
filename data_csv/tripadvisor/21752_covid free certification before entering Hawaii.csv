Has anyone heard anything about a new travel requirement of Covid 19 free certificate before entering Hawaii
It's something that has been suggested and recommended but as of this moment isn't required. More than likely will pass after the visitor quarantine is lifted.
"How can you ""certify"" covid free at the time you enter Hawaii ?"
"Problems: 1. Getting this certification test. Also, there has been talk that tests are not necessarily reliable and they're even questioning how long an immunity would last. 2. What Placebets said - You can test negative the day before you leave but that's still no guarantee. You'll be travelling through airports that will not require this. How long before you travel would you have to get it? Unless it's right up to the point of boarding or even beyond how sure is it."
"I've heard about it.I wouldn't trust it.It usually takes days to get the result back from the lab.Plus, one of the main issues I see is that you can't even get a test just because you want it."
I suppose a vaccine requirement when available or an antibody positive should be ok. But since they are questioning getting it a second time who knows.
"I got a test this morning. Took 5 minutes , nasal swab in the car and had results in 30 minutes. Tests now are readily available and good profit makers. I am sure you could get Marriott to pay for them .No it is not a 100% solution. MAybe onlry a 90% solution. The only 100% solution is another 1-2 years of total tourist ban."
13 sailors from the USS Theodore Roosevelt who passed rigorous tests that they had recovered from it have tested positive for it again. Bad news !
"Yep, I posted about the first 5 sailors the other day. They are an example of what we **don't know** about this virus. Was it actually a new infection? Or a flare of the previous one? Is it the same makeup, or did the virus mutate in Round 2? There has been plenty of news about whether the rapid test (see white house aides) are reliable or not. Also plenty of news about other tests not catching it........or only catching it if the tests are done in a controlled setting by a qualified person.I think the problem is larger than any one factor. That causes a lot of craziness, because people want ONE ANSWER NOW. They don't want to wait, take things slower, or understand that there may not be any complete, single magic bullet (test or vaccine) for a long time to come. They want it NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This is a test of people's ability to see a larger world than their own. Millions are doing incredible things that help others every day, and saving lives as well. Focus on those things for now, and help others get through this period if you can."

""". They are an example of what we **don't know** about this virus.""Yes, there is a lot we don't know and may never know. Viruses morph. Even annual flu shots are hit or miss. They develop a shot for the strain but then the strain morphs or a different strain becomes dominant. States are looking at this as ""have to get rid of this completely before we allow anyone in"". This isn't practical. Not much different from the polio vaccine, as an example. People thought polio was completely wiped out with the two vaccines in the 50's but it was still there, lying dormant somewhere, and now on the increase again in some countries. This speaks to the importance of vaccinations.This is something we will all learn to deal with like we have with other viruses. We will be smarter from this experience and people will or should take vaccinations more seriously. Hopefully immunity will continue to increase. Studies of New York State show only roughly 20% are currently immune but that will continue to rise as time goes on. I don't believe some of these Draconian measures talked about are practical in the long run.Edited: 3:14 pm, May 17, 2020 "
"I would also keep an eye on processes discussed at your local airport. Some airports are less ""clumsy"" than others when change is necessary. Lighter on their feet, so to speak. The State of California may be facilitating a process with partner States.Edited: 3:22 pm, May 17, 2020 "
"Yea, I like that Eric Garcetti says Los Angeles will never be fully reopened until their is a cure !Wonder how many people will still be in LA then ?"
"not to be controversial but initial mortality claims have not come true. That was he reason to declare this a pandemic. Not sure it would still qualify. 250,000 people died in the USA due to hospital mistakes last year."
"No, Joe, the potential mortality rate wasn’t the reason it was declared a pandemic. The widespread geographic presence and proportion of populations affected is the basis.~ Colleen"
Then Colleen there should be a declaration every year for influenza if that is the criteria.
"Joe, you can learn about the difference between seasonal flu epidemics and flu pandemics here: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/resource-center/free…~ Colleen"
And also do some research on what effect the curve flattening is having.
There are very sick people being sent homeFrom hospitals without even being tested . Most drs are saying if your sick just treat the situation as if your positive to be safe and stay quarantined . It’s not that readily available everywhere
"California is really, really stepping up with the testing. But it's a big job in a big State. Our number of positive cases has increased ... which, of course, is a no-brainer. That's why we test: to find out who is positive, count them, isolate them and treat them. And identify their contacts - so they can be tested as well.That's why we can selectively reopen some areas while number of positives is still growing a little. And the numbers are growing because they are identified."
"The hospital my daughter works at is now testing every patient who come into the hospital for any reason, so I think they are catching up, but not sure there are enough tests for EVERYONE to get tested.Edited: 6:23 pm, May 17, 2020 "
"Curve flattening means absolutely nothing without testing. The ""known cases"" we can deal with somehow. The ""unknown"" can really kill us."
"""I got a test this morning. Took 5 minutes , nasal swab in the car and had results in 30 minutes.""Wow. Where I live the only test available to the masses is the 2-3 day kind. Now, if the testee is a health-care worker, there's a quicker version. It's either 6 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes, depending on which state agency is talking about it."
"In AZ, anyone can get tested at any time without a doctor's order and without symptoms. The bit of good news is that the patients who were positive, recovered, and then tested positive again were not truly infected a second time. These were particles of the virus that were showing up on the test, but were ""dead"" and non-infective."
"Iceland is opening to tourism in about a month. Upon arrival travelers will be given a COVID-19 test and results are going to be processed immediately at the airport. Those that test positive will have to quarantine for 14 days at their own cost. I think that's a responsible way of opening to tourism and I would like to see Hawaii following their lead in July.Edited: 4:51 am, May 20, 2020 "
"Katarzina,How are they going to process immediately ? What test are they using that we don't have that is reliable ?Karen Kathryn can you provide some link to where you got this information ? I have never seen that before and I know they have said USS Roosevelt had sailors reinfected ""These were particles of the virus that were showing up on the test, but were ""dead"" and non-infective.""Edited: 7:59 am, May 20, 2020 "
"The above Iceland scenario seems absolutely backwards to me. Why would you give the test AFTER people arrive in your Country/State? That means they were on the plane with 150 or so other people who could have just gotten infected but passed the arrival test and were let out into society. Also, why would people wait to take the test after they have already paid for their trip and now have to lock themselves in a hotel room for the duration of their stay, or turn around and head home?Seems to me the time for the test is at the departure airport so you can keep infected people from ever coming into contact with non infected ones during the travel process. I also think this would be better for traveler confidence. People might feel more comfortable flying again if they knew everyone on the plane had just passed a test instead of arriving at their destination to find out that family of four in the row in front of them just tested positive."
"Adkboads, yes that’s a solution that makes more sense. It would work better if the airlines weren’t getting rid of their nonstops since you could get exposed at a mainland airport. We on the west coast wouldn’t see another airport until Honolulu, but if you’re flying from the east coast you might have to get tested again. There is going to have to be a whole new category of probably expensive travel insurance. One that covers you if you test positive at the airport."
"Placebets, the article I read didn't provide specifics about testing technology they are planning to use in Iceland. However, I remember that about 2 months ago scientists from Oxford University had already developed a test that gives results in about 20 minutes and the manufacturing process was to start sometime in April. Adkboards those who are going to be able to prove they were recently tested negative will be allowed to forego the arrival exam. And I agree, getting a test prior to flying to your destination makes much more sense. My guess is they are giving a chance to visit Iceland to those who don't have an easy access to testing at their home countries..Edited: 9:09 am, May 20, 2020 "
#25. New data suggest people aren’t getting reinfected with the coronavirus (ScienceNews)https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavi…
"You're right, adkboards. It would make more sense to test people before they get on the plane. The problem is how that would be organized. Who would be responsible for it and pay for all of that overhead. Would the airlines be expected to know what the destination airports all want? Would they assume the responsibility for sorting that all out and organizing it? It would be one huge bureaucratic nightmare. People can travel through multiple airports and have stops and layovers along the way. On the idea that tests are not 100% accurate...... Of course , they never are. But if it's all you have to work with then that's the best they can do. There are false positives and false negatives with most tests. Jusat my opinion but there are major problems with every single one of the ideas that have been floating around. No place will be able to survive in a plastic bubble forever. In the long run that's even a detriment."
"Yes the point is it is the best alternative to getting some people back to work. Let travelers decide if they want a test or not. We all have been sitting for 8 weeks doing nothing, a test does not sound like a deal killer to me. I have had 2, both a covid and a anti body test. I had to get a medical procedure and they required a covid test before entering the facility, not that big of a deal. Did it the day before in my car. Tests are easily available now to anyone who wants to get one. The mayor says 37000 unemployed in just Maui, that will not work for long."
"""Tests are easily available now to anyone who wants to get one.""In California?"
I am guessing anywhere at this point. The test shortage was a couple of weeks ago.
"<< The problem is how that would be organized. Who would be responsible for it and pay for all of that overhead. Would the airlines be expected to know what the destination airports all want? Would they assume the responsibility for sorting that all out and organizing it? It would be one huge bureaucratic nightmare. People can travel through multiple airports and have stops and layovers along the way. >>Not sure how testing at the airport would be any different than the current security procedures. Once a person goes through security they are assumed to be ""clear"" through to their destination, (wherever that may be), with as many stops along the way, as long as they do not leave the secure area of whatever airport they are in. If they do, they must go through security again. Testing could be done the same way with areas of the airports assumed ""clear"" from the disease, and as long as a passenger stays in these areas, they are assumed to be virus free. Their final destination doesn't really matter.But this is all a moot point because there are still a million things that could go wrong with any of these ideas. What about luggage? Are we going have to run our luggage through UV light machines? How does that help if someone has a contaminated item INSIDE their luggage? They unpack their luggage in the hotel, the virus gets into the room, the maid then gets it and brings it to the next 10 rooms, the guests there then get it, and yada, yada, yada, you have a new outbreak.There is going to be risk, and people are going to get sick, but locking everyone away until there is a cure is not a viable solution. Things will be worked out over time and a new way of travel will develop. I am sure if we were on this forum on 9/10/2001 and I proposed the current security procedures at airports today, we would all think it impossible and a ""bureaucratic nightmare"", but it got done."
"You're on to something adkboards. I heard on Hawaii News Now a couple of days ago that the TSA is considering taking temps at certain airports in the US. That's the Feds. So, they would pay for it, through our taxes. Also, HNL is considering using thermal scanners. They talked about using some of the money from the CARES act to pay for those.There's still a long way to go before this is any type of solution or uniformity but you need to start somewhere. The quarantine will stay in effect here, I believe, until the state government gets a plan in place."
"taking temperatures in Asia is fairly common, they use the gun and can do it quickly. We have been wiping down our airline seats for years with antiseptic wipes. I am sure it will be the new normal. One issue is airlines will have to end the policy of losing everything if you change a flight. That has been a horrible policy for years and needs to change. It is crazy. I remember in the 80s, the hotels would work with the Airlines to try to get you to extend your trip."
As far as smuggling Corona in luggage the smuggler would probably have it too unless it is planned to be hidden. My opinion.
"Well, sure, I get that it could be done the same way as the TSA screenings at airports. But that was set up as a program for all travellers to all destinations by all airports and airlines and wasn't specific for one state. In this case we're talking about the State of Hawaii's 14 day quarantine and getting all airlines and airports and airlines to produce this procedure for Hawaii? That's where I don't think it's going to happen. If ALL states had a similar quarantine and ALL airports and ALL airlines felt the need to do this then yes, it could be instituted the same way it was after 9/11.Edited: 3:25 pm, May 20, 2020 "
"It's just one of many ideas floating around the task force napaguy. There would have to be coordination between state, airlines and airports, hopefully they realize that. There hasn't been anything decided yet. I think that's why we still have the quarantine. When they come up with a process, (whatever that is) that's when I think the quarantine will be lifted."
"I've seen articles where they are able to train dogs to smell the virus so they might be able to use them to sniff your luggage or even screen passengers. I really doubt it, but they might."
Travel insurance needs to be factor. Something different than they all ready have. Test positive at airport policy. If there is a chance of losing the cost of your trip the day you fly out would everyone do it?
Disney Springs which is the shopping area in Walt Disney World opened today with temperature screening and face masks. Seems to work fine for the people who want to be there. https://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attra…
"Yes, I had heard that Disney Springs was going to open. I think it all comes down to how much an entity, whether a state or a business, WANT people in. If they do, they will make something work. I don't think Hawaii is there yet."
There are also questions about whether the people who test positive a 2nd are shedding dead virus and therefore not contagious.
#43 Napaguy - I think you described the current situation.
"I skimmed the Disney Springs article. It appears about a third of the complex was open? The rest stayed closed, correct?Sounds like Ala Moana (though no sit down food there yet)."
"I think this will be a non-starter .Once people start traveling again how in the world is Hawaii going to check/certify every one and on top of that who says they don't get the virus ""while"" they are traveling after they are certified.As soon as the planes start flying again and cruise ships start sailing again each with several thousand tourists a day, how in the world is that going to work. Hawaii doesn't have that many people living on the islands to check 250 thousand tourists a day.Additionally, Hawaii better start opening soon or they will miss out on HUGE amounts of revenue as tourists are making their summer and fall reservations NOW to other countries and states ""that do want tourists back"".If they don't open soon, I would NOT want to be a local Hawaii resident because we know that the state will NOT cut spending so the locals will be making up the tax difference in higher costs and taxes since ""tourism"" IS Hawaii's economy.This is just my opinion."
">>>It appears about a third of the complex was open?<<<The non-Disney owned restaurants and shops were given the option to reopen, some did, some didn't. I don't think any Disney owned facilities reopened."
"FranZ, many states that are going to drag this out are figuring on bailouts by the federal government no matter what. I'm not saying this is the thinking of the Governor of Hawaii but I hope it's not because no bailout is going tobe enough to recoup the dollars lost by a place like Hawaii that had a very viable economy even though it was mostly tourism. I honestly believe if this is dragged out too long people will no longer be waiting for the doors to open again. They'll be giving other places a shot and maybe liking what they see, a lot. This is what I've heard from a number of people who make Hawaii their annual trip but are anxious to make plans for into 2021 and are making them elsewhere.."

"HTA says 250K on average every day:https:/…Not sure where you got 30K a day, fish."
Me either!!
"I agree that 2021 is a pretty good bet. I just know that many people I've talked to and heard from consider Hawaii to still be taking too big of a chance even for 2021. They want to make plans now and they're not going to bank on Hawaii even in 2021. They're looking at places that they feel will be ready for them and welcoming.  Lots of people want to make plans now and aren't going to wait for Hawaii to decide. There was an article written by a writer with Bloomberg and it was syndicated through many major newspapers about the measures Hawaii has taken and is considering. It painted a very bleak picture and was enough to turn people off. I'm going to try to find it online and I'll post it.Yes, there has been some positive movement but I think many travelers still feel it will be a long time before they'll be welcome.Edited: 3:50 pm, May 22, 2020 "
"Here's the article:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020…Despite some positive things happening this article paints a very bleak picture for anyone considering booking a future trip to Hawaii. And this article was reprinted in major newspapers such as the New York Times. Dated just 4 days ago.If I didn't know that there was some positive movement in Hawaii there's no way, after reading this article, that I would pull the trigger for a Hawaii trip even in 2021. If I'm sitting there with money in my pocket and ready to book a 2021 vacation it wouldn't be Hawaii after reading this article.Edited: 3:54 pm, May 22, 2020 "
"Napa,I agree 100%, even if they do get fed $$ it will only be pennies on the dollar. I know many folks around here that got ""refunds"" for their Hawaii trip and are now going elsewhere. Who knows, they may find another vacation spot to continually go to instead of Hawaii.I know I had to cancel my 2 trips later this year, one this summer and my second one in November. We'll be going to Idaho this summer and Florida this November since Hawaii is off limits.Diva,I'm just going according to the ""Hawaii Tourist Authority"" almost 10.5 MILLION tourists arrived in Hawaii in 2019 or almost 250,000 tourist on average on any given day and they spent almost $18 BILLION where $2.07 BILLION went for State taxes.https:/…Question is, who's going to make up that $2 Billion dollar tax hole, it won't be the tourists if Hawaii doesn't open up soon. The Hawaii governor is going to have to really cut spending to balance his 2020 budget or raise taxes to the moon for the locals. What else can he do.Edited: 4:12 pm, May 22, 2020 "
"The State Leg already id'd over 2 Billion (yes, with a ""B"" in money that can be used, from our own funds/accounts/ cost savings details.We ain't gonna die in a month, or even 5. People forget that overall, tourism accounts for about 37% of employment--direct AND indirect............"
"I just read that article and I don't see what you see Napaguy. There's nothing in that article that most people don't know already. Of course anyone can choose not to come, nothing I can do to change that perception. I do know what mainlanders perceive and what truly is in Hawaii are usually very far apart."
"Do we really have close to 1,000 flights coming in per day? Because with 250 people per plane that is what it would take to hit 250k passengers per day. That number does seem high."
30K a day is about average for *arrivals* into the State. 250K a day is average number of tourists *in* the State per day.
"Ahh, so I wasn't actually off just off on the verbiage."
"LOL, pretty huge diff between the two definitions and numbers!"
"""I just read that article and I don't see what you see Napaguy.""The facts can be simply stated but this article went further than that. It was the tone of the article by omitting any comments about future plans for reopening, phases, what people might expect and when they might ""possibly"" see it. It gave absolutely no insight into further down the road and no hope for someone who would like to go someday. Then the final coup was at the end when it wrapped up by saying Hawaii is in this for the long run.To me, it was all very negative and painted a very sad picture of things to come with no let-up in sight. Again, take a person who is clueless about the situation in Hawaii. They cancelled their 2020 trip somewhere and are now chomping at the bit to book a trip for 2021. After reading this gloom and doom article they sure won't choose Hawaii. That's how I see it and I'm stickin' with it."
"“(T)ake a person who is clueless about the situation in Hawaii....”This is key. Hawaii residents & regulars don’t realize that most people have no idea how Hawaii is responding to this. It isn’t as if the TA Forums are a go-to news source, lol. Media doesn’t highlight Hawaii any more than it does (insert any state west of the Mississippi, save California). Fish observed that the article doesn’t speak to anything “most people” don’t already know. Don’t be so sure.~ Colleen"
"I'm on the email list for Tamba Surf Shop and they sent out a newsletter detailing a first hand account of what it's like to come to Kauai during the quarantine. Seems like they're doing a great job, given the lack of cases there. Here's a copy and paste:One Tamba employee has had a firsthand view of how it is for someone to fly here. Grandmom moved here from the mainland, planned for a long time, to live in the mother-in-law unit, and arrived Tuesday. She took abundant precautions while navigating the airports, with gloves, masks, and extra layers of clothes to avoid touching surfaces with her skin. Picked up upon arrival, they approached the checkpoint, on the airport's exit road.There is a long line of cones, and too many cops to count. The first officer stops the vehicle and asks how many travellers are inside. One. Officer says to pull over to the shoulder with the other cars. Another officer with a clipboard asks a bunch of questions and gathers relevant data like address and phone, and confirms the two week quarantine time. The process is quick and they drive home.Next day, the police call and confirm the info, confirm grandmom is there, and explain they can and probably will come by the house at random times to check in. And the day after that, they do come by un-announced. And they probably will again. They checked her ID and asked questions to ensure here compliance. But grandmom knows she has to be good, and for sure her family wants her to quarantine too. There's no bending the rules even for family, we have zero cases and want to keep it that way. Here's your food grandma, we love you, wash your hands.But us healthy folks are allowed out, and we are going. Tamba plans to go down the Napali Coast this weekend on a big SUP. Other folks might take advantage of all the freshly-opened activity tours like zipline and horseback riding. And the beaches will teem with souls that were pent up and burned out on TV binging. Life will be something. Somewhere in there, all of us will (or should) take some time to remember and thank our veterans this weekend, Memorial Day weekend."
"Agree completely, Colleen."
"""One Tamba employee has had a firsthand view of how it is for someone to fly here.

"One of the problems with testing people on arrival to the airport, much like the proceedings at security, is that there are still airport employees, flight crew, etc that travelers come in contact with past the security checkpoint. They would need to be tested before every shift also. Doesn’t seem plausible, but I sure don’t know what the answer is. So glad I’m not the one making these decisions!"
There are checkpoints both in the airport and once you leave the airport here.
Are they administering tests at the Check points ?
"Not to my knowledge. Just collecting phone and lodging and family information, along with reviewing the rules of the quarantine. Kauai doesn't have quick testing at this point, so would not get the results back for a few days anyway."
"When one talks about doing tests at the airports-either departure or arrivals--one needs to remember that IF the assorted employees are wearing masks etc., chances of enough contact to sicken a traveler are minimal.You wouldn't be hugging the person with the scanner, LOL. Or getting a lei and a kiss with the swab.........Since the Abbot Labs kit isn't so great after all, I think they are still trying to consider other tests and companies. Not sure where it stands----but the FAA did say that Hawaii could require tests, as far as *they* were concerned. No word from the White House still though."
There is no covid19 testing done at any of the airports in Hawaii. They do take temps. My dh did a voluntary comprehensive antibody test that was available to all hospital employees here on Kauai.
"As long as masks are worn correctly...this is a big problem, too, as least in my city. Employees at various places are wearing masks..but half the time they are pulled down under the nose, under the chin, etc. Airports would need to be super diligent about their employees."
"Exactly, duvey. It's a problem everywhere."
"The ""masks issue"". It might seem like a small thing but it's a huge factor. And this is one more thing where every state in this union got caught with their pants down and could have been prepared. If not ventilators then why not simple and effective masks? And why wasn't the directives from the CDC so bungled on this? First it was you don't need masks then masks being required everywhere became the thing. Figure the amount of money we all pay each year to our states and their health departments. It's bad enough that each state had not formulated it's own plan for such a crisis but they couldn't even come prepared to have a medically approved and effective mask for every resident of the state? At maybe a buck a crack? If it weren't so serious I'd have to laugh at some of the masks I see people having to make do with. Many people I see seem more concerned with making them a fashion statement. I wonder just how effective they are.This was an all around failure at preparedness on all levels - federal AND states. They were all caught with their pants down. There's enough blame to pass around on this.Edited: 8:54 pm, May 25, 2020 "
"Just how do we prepare for a pandemic nobody had experience with? And even if that's possible, then prepare for it coming from communist China, who hesitated sharing information and hoarded medical supplies. And a corrupt WHO, whose leader was hand-picked by China."
"There have been past pandemics. If you go back about 15 years there was talk questioning if this country was ready for a pandemic. Requests for money for pandemic preparedness and more funding of the CDC was discussed enough yet , given all of the concerns with the wars in the Middle East at that time, it fell on deaf ears in BOTH SIDES of Congress. The issue of pandemic-preparedness was actually raised by Obama again, in 2008-2009, but again, due to the recession at that time, it was brushed aside. There were bigger fish to fry at that time. Then there's the individual states who all have their own Departments of Health and they took little to no action to do anything to prepare for this eventuality for their taxpayers. The blame can be spread far and wide. The can had been kicked down the road for years. Do some research online back to these times and you'll find it. I suppose human nature is not to prepare for something that happens only every 25-50 years apart. On the flip side, all of the talk about this country doing the worst is bogus. Sure, we have more cases than other countries but we're also the most populous. Our deaths per million put us right in the middle of the pack and still doing better than many of our Western European allies.Edited: 10:07 am, May 26, 2020 "
"Exactly placebets. You could get it at the airport of origin, on the plane or waiting for your luggage when you arrive. Maybe on the shuttle bus to the car rental. There is no way to guarantee it so is it just to sound like their doing something so the public will be ok with tourists coming back? What are people to do if they text positive at the airport but have already put thousands down on a rental that are to check into that day? Will there be a new, probably, expensive category of travel insurance? I don’t see cfar taking up this as coverage."
"Oh boy, I am a structural engineer in California, I spent the last 42 years designing buildings for an earthquake that 99% will never see. Pandemics are more common, more wide spread, more deadly, more costly and I was shocked to see we do nothing to prepare for them. We have a team of structural engineers that are trained and certified, all at their own expense, who will be on the scene on any major earthquake day 2. We will not be asking China for information,Any good business will have a 6 month backlog of supply of a material that is essential. There are strikes, dock strikes, fires, anything can happen. To see hospitals run our of masks and ppe in the first couple of weeks is totally inexcusable. We throw billions into medical, they need to be Better prepared. We basically had no plan with covid. To lead the world in deaths is inexcusable. That will not happen with an earthquake, I will promise you"
"Agree, Longboard. And the problems in preparedness go back years. The idea of a pandemic was always in the recesses of the minds of many but was kicked down the road repeatedly. With the SARS in 2004 and the H1N1 in 2009 we were plain old lucky. The SARS virus just lacked the ability to thrive and with the H1N1 the symptoms were uniform and easily spotted. Plus, lucky us that a vaccine was found that same year. Neither of these reached the level of pandemic that this virus has and we were just lucky. It wasn't because of pandemic preparedness. Hopefully everyone concerned will have learned from this virus and pandemic preparedness will be in our future.Just one point...... If you go by the deaths per million we are not leading the world. The media likes to throw out just the number of cases and deaths and based on that, yes, we're at the top but the more accurate measure is the per million numbers."
"Public health in this country has been seriously underfunded for years, the NSC published a guidebook on infectious disease response in 2016, and the US ranks 12th among 213 countries in deaths per million due to COVID."
"Its air travel. A disease that would have ended on its own 100 years ago, can spread world wide in a few weeks. This is not the end of this, we better figure it out and do a better job next time."
">>>Public health in this country has been seriously underfunded for years<<<I think ""public health"" is overfunded for the benefits they return. Napaguy has it exactly right. For all the billions CA spends on the state, county and city level health departments, we should have had a better Covid 19 response.The use spends far more on health care than any nation by far, most of it paid for by health insurance.https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nations-h…"
"Public health in this country is pretty much like every other government funded and managed objective. It is grossly over funded, and full of fraud, waste and abuse."
"Public health ... oh, you guys are SO wrong! As one who spend decades in public health policy ... I can tell you without a doubt that you are wrong. It's human nature to focus on those things that you can see ... highways, buildings, checks that come to you in the mail. Public health is silent. And it can save your life ... or give you a long, healthy one. And you won't even know it! The absence of a strong, coordinated public health system is glaring during a crisis. But when public health ""works"" ... the science is current and widespread ... we take it for granted. Weaknesses in the American public health system? Sure, I could go on for hours. But is it a matter of life and death? Yes.Coordination is a problem ... but it's not intrinsically public health's problem. It's a governance issue ... local, State and Federal. You could say the very same thing about law enforcement, water management, roads/highways.Edited: 3:16 pm, May 26, 2020 "
"""It's a governance issue"" ? I think that is code for waste, fraud and abuse...."
"Wrong again, placebets. Believe it or not ... it's structural. We simply have not moved into the 21st Century. ""Waste, fraud and abuse"" ... that would be treating the symptoms ... not the base of problem. Think about it ..."
"Structural problems are the epitome of waste, fraud and abuse BL....think about it ..."
"The absence of a strong, coordinated public health system is glaring during a crisis. But when public health ""works"" ... the science is current and widespread ... we take it for granted.BLBL, that goes without saying. The point is in this case it didn't ""work"". And our public health systems and authorities , both state and federal, have had many years and lots of money given them to get us prepared. But they failed to do so."
"Umm, public health expenditures and health care expenditures are two separate things. U.S. health care spending in 2018 was $3.6 trillion or $11,172 per person, 17.7 percent of GDP. Agree the current health care system is unsustainable. Public health funding, by comparison, is $87 per citizen. DH and I spent more than that on pupus and cocktails the last time we visited our favorite HI haunt. Overfunded? Hardly."
">>>U.S. health care spending in 2018 was $3.6 trillion or $11,172 per person, 17.7 percent of GDP. Agree the current health care system is unsustainable. Public health funding, by comparison, is $87 per citizen.<<<It is surprisingly difficult to find out what each individual state spends in total on health every year. Most of the sites I found were activist sites and only spoke in terms of per capita, not absolute spending. The last year I could find was 2015, when states spent $605 billion on health. It was not clear if that included city and county health departments, but I would think not.Of the $3.6 trillion in spending on health in 2018, $1.7 trillion is directly or indirectly funded by the federal government, according to The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.Now that number is strictly health care, it doesn't include the budget for HHS, CDC, etc.As flat footed as many state appear to have been caught by this crisis, I wonder what it is that they do. That doesn't mean county hospitals, clinics, etc, but the bureaucrats with big salaries who are now directing our lives and livelihoods."
"This thread needs to be shut down. People are reading through 91 (92 now) posts to see if there has been an updated answer to the poster's question when the whole thing is more like a covid smorgasbord.It would be better to have a separate topic for the regular Kauai members who want to talk about covid politics and stats amongst each other, and labelled so that people know it's off topic (because of the seriousness of the issue, people can't but help read ever single post relating to covid. They should not have to wade through mountains of off topic posts)."
"Agree with Turtwig! I was looking for the latest on COVID directives. Plus reading recent posts on the thread makes me want to get political SO BAD. So here goes—maybe this will shut down the thread!Just stop beating up on government in general. Current public health system failures are absolutely intentional policy decisions designed to do exactly what placebets and scottca accuse government of. So people lose confidence in the prospect of fair and equitable well run government and therefore think the answer is to dismantle and privatize. Because that is SO equitable and cost effective. I’m not having it. You are educated, well off people with the ability to inform yourselves and not accept propaganda that plays on your self interest."

"A total tourist ban for one or two years would result in a total dependence on welfare of the Hawaii residents. A not very good and positive way to live.And meanwhile, there will be other viruses and pandemics. So, if someone desires 100% security and safety, that person might as well jump off of the cliffs of Polihale, the departure spot of all spirits.."
Who said 100 percent?
"""A total tourist ban for one or two years would result in a total dependence on welfare of the Hawaii residents. A not very good and positive way to live.I totally disagree with this. The state of Hawaii will become more sustainable and find other ways to survive without over-tourism which is not good for the locals or the island. The garden island can grow food all year round. Many families already started by supporting local businesses instead of buying on-line. They are determined to keep the money in Hawaii. Everyone from the governor down said they were over-dependent on tourism and they are finally doing something about it. There is a big ""buy local"" campaign going on. With over 70,000 people living there, there are plenty of people to support local businesses. The stores have already started changing to accommodate locals who they now depend on. The stores that don't adapt for locals will probably not survive. It is a beautiful thing when residents support their own community. You are not giving them enough credit, they love having their beaches back and the lack of traffic jams. They care about each other and sharing of food and supplies is part of the culture. Yes it's a new world. For Kaua'i it just might be a better one."""
"Echo, you think Hawaii can survive as a mostly agrarian society? That would mean agriculture to grow crops for their OWN sustenance because the idea of growing crops there for export is not sustainable. Look at the pineapple industry and what happened to it as an example. Is there over-tourism that could be corrected? Sure, but I don't think this signals an entire change of life is in the making or that it's even what most people there would want. For locals who want to leave the islands and travel themselves the airlines aren't going to be sending over empty planes to come and get them. I hear your sentiments. They just need a reality check."
"Seeing Hanalei for the first time since mid Febrary yesterday was rather depressing. No waiting at the bridge, drove straight to Ching Young Village and there were more empty parking spaces than those that were taken. This is at 3:00pm on Sunday afternoon. Most of the shops were open but no one in them. Most folks were there to get food for take out. That's why we went. Between the flood of a couple of years ago and now, I don't know how much longer these owners can hang on."
"Napaguy, I guess the statement """"A total tourist ban for one or two years would result in a total dependence on welfare of the Hawaii residents."" is more to your liking. BTW, that wishful thinking was what I was responding to. Mainlanders are really good at telling Hawaii residents their worst case scenarios. Pardon me for showing the positive side."
"I for one appreciate your comments, Echo, and see what you have described happening right now.People built tourism-based businesses because of the dominance of the tourism industry here. And tourism will always be with us. But it doesn't have to have such an overwhelming, crushing, impact on our islands. Many, many of us work in areas that have nothing whatsoever to do with tourism; we provide services and goods for each other. It's not a fairy-tale scenario that we could build a better, more resilient economy that includes tourism, but is not defined by it."
"""So here goes—maybe this will shut down the thread!...So people lose confidence in the prospect of fair and equitable well run government and therefore think the answer is to dismantle and privatize.""In the interest of helping you out, ruthliz, there is another alternative to dismantling and privatizing government programs and services. We could instead dismantle and replace the entrenched governmental bureaucracies that currently run them. In fact, didn't our current president run on a platform intended to do exactly that. :-)Edited: 2:41 pm, June 01, 2020 "
"It would help if the local residence on this forum share how they make their living, it is pretty easy to say we do not need tourists when you do not need a paycheck. it would be nice to hear from a hotel bartender or Polynesian dancer on what their feelings are of living with no tourism.I know enough about the hotel industry to know seniority is extremely important. Throw that all out the window with an extended shutdown and my guess certain people will not be happy."
Agreed longboard.I give it until Christmas and if things in Hawaii don't come back 100% you watch all the locals going bananas and crying because their property/house/car taxes went crazy and their fuel tax went up along with their state sales tax because they don't have the free $$ from tourists. We know Hawaii won't cut tax income so someone is going to pay.
"Some of these posts remind me of Hilo Karen:https://www.kitv.com/story/42196889/hilo-kar…Fran---property taxes are set by June for the following year. Gas taxes are not often raised, and while they could be, I doubt it. I don't know what you mean by ""house"" tax....that would be in the property tax. As for ""state sales tax""...we don't have one. We have the GET. ""car"" taxes-I guess you mean vehicle registration fees? They're already set too.I don't call the money reaped from tourists OR residents ""free money"". That's insulting, IMO.The State Leg already identified over 2 billion that can be saved through cutbacks, not filling vacant positions, and more. Sure, furloughs and other cuts could be ahead in 2021. But frankly, I don't see much of that for 2020.Edited: 3:53 pm, June 01, 2020 "
"One of the things I love about Waikiki, is I feel like I know most the people that work there. You see the same bartenders and valets for the last 20 years. You just do not get that anywhere else. People get a good position like a Moana Beach Bar bartender and they do not give it up. The Royal Hawaiian Mai Tai bar actually has plaques on certain bar stools honoring some of their best repeat customers, who have been coming several times a year for decades. Hawaii is that special kind of place. Sorry but Hawaii is about tourists. That is not going to change. You want to get away from tourists, I suggest Guam."
"wow!! Since Hawaii has asked tourists ""not to come right now"" the viciousness comes out. The people of Hawaii have given their aloha and this is the lack of respect they get in return. Very sad, selfish people that only care about their personal wants and chose to insult the population of the very place they want to vacation!"
Hilo Karen even made it to British media:https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-830…
"Agree with longboard. I know a local couple on Kauai, both in the hospitality industry, and they are both currently furloughed. They cannot wait for the tourists to come back and get back to work. I'd imagine there are tons of locals that feel the same way."
"I'll tell you about us, longboard. My dh and me anyway. I haven't worked outside the home since we moved to Hawaii in 2001. I'm a retired county worker but have no retirement or pension. I do bring in social security. My dh is in facilities maintenance. Worked in the visitor industry on Maui and for 3 years on Kauai and now is a facilities manager at the hospital. Been working 50-60 hrs a week making the hospital a safe place for folks to be. We know we are blessed to have a steady income. Most of our neighbors have lost their jobs. Friends and family on the mainland have lost jobs or businesses. It's not like we are immune to their pain. We have been regularly giving to the Kauai Food Bank and supporting the local businesses in take out and now, shops that are open. We do our best to not take anyone who is less fortunate than we for granted."
"I can share our situation as well. We retired to Kauai 5 years ago, but still do some work from home. Most of it tied to the stock market, so pretty volatile these last few days. About 75% of our friends on the island have been laid off, although some have gone back to work with things reopening. None are hostile or really upset, as things will open and recover over time. But many live with extended family and also don't want to bring the disease home to them.Like Fish we have been donating to the food bank, along with volunteering for them once a week to deliver fresh produce to Kupuna. And we are happily supporting Kauai Beer Company now that dine-in restaurant service has restarted. You will find us at Rob's on Friday when they reopen, our usual local spot."
"fish and jenz, mahalo for sharing your stories. Helps those of us not on-island understand the situation ""on the ground."" Supporting local businesses and community members in need is something many of us are doing in our area as well. We are beginning to open up, but many folks are shy to venture out.We are team ""roll back Hawaii tourism."" We have visited for 30+ years. Full disclosure...Maui and Hawaii Island, Kauai just once. Maui has maxed out in recent years. BI not as much but still a noticeable impact re: overtourism. We would love to see tourism ratchet back in a meaningful way, not just a 'lil bit. Unsure how this would be sustainable over the long haul, though."
"Just back to the original topic on a Covid 'certification' prior to traveling....I just recently read a news article (from a small midwest town I originated from) that was written by a local that received a voluntary and free Covid test. This small town offered free Covid tests (250 available) on a first come-first serve basis on June 1st. The article was written as a first hand account of that process. The writer went on to say it was a drive thru event and they performed a throat swab test. What caught my eye and was of most interest was the amount of time he was told it would take to receive results;If a person tested POSITIVE (has the Covid) they would be notified within 72 hours in order to begin proper protocol.If they tested negative, there is less priority on the results and they may not receive them for a week or more.This type of timeframe certainly does not play well with trying to have results in order to travel.Maybe its the type of test (free) involved or available? Has anyone heard of a more expedient test being used?"
"""Napaguy, I guess the statement """"A total tourist ban for one or two years would result in a total dependence on welfare of the Hawaii residents."" is more to your liking.BTW, that wishful thinking was what I was responding to. Mainlanders are really good at telling Hawaii residents their worst case scenarios. Pardon me for showing the positive side.""Echo, first, you quoted that statement as if I said it. That was not my statement. You think I would like the Hawaiian residents to be 100% dependent on welfare? That is exactly what I would NOT like to see but high unemployment could be the result.Secondly, I don't see your comments as being ""positive"". The idea of a mostly Kamaaina based economy is unrealistic for Hawaii. It's actually unrealistic for any place unless that place is willing to become a very bare bones society and willing to toss out much of the lifestyles that it's people have gotten used to and like."
@ craig h@: Had nothing to do with the test being free or not. Quickie results tests are not as reliable. The disparity in the notification times is because if you test positive right away they have to send it to the lab to grow a culture to be to confirm. It takes a couple days to grow it in a Petri dish. The amount of viral load has To to be checked. If your viral load passes a certain threshold then you are considered infected and sick. If the viral load is under threshold you are among those who may be carrying but not actively sick.
"Craig,""If a person tested POSITIVE (has the Covid) they would be notified within 72 hours in order to begin proper protocol.If they tested negative, there is less priority on the results and they may not receive them for a week or more.""I've read similar reports and been told similar by health care professionals. One place told me they wouldn't notify me at all if the test was negative. Way to leave a patient hangng! I queried whether they were serious and they said they were."
