Do you think this new flu epidemic will affect travel??? Worried (for more reasons than just my trip!)
"This flu has only been reported in Mexico and the US. For me I'm not concerned because you can pretty much catch anything anywhere now. We had SARS a few yrs back and I was in the hospitals during that time, I actually didn't know a sould who got it but it caused wide spread panic.They are suggesting that if you are traveling to Mexico to get a flu shot but honestly if it's a new flu strain the flu shot probably won't work for it."
"Butterflies -Yeah - I thought about the shot. Have had one, but this is such a unique strain that - you are right - it wouldn't matter. My concern is being on the plane with a butch of people and then we are not even traveling until July so I wonder if they are going to get this under wraps. I read somewhere (drudgereport I think) that the CDC said that it was already too late to be contained. Scary stuff! Hopefully I am just freaking out for no reason! "
Best to speak to your 'Doc'!...the only one to give you the appropriate advice!Babb4
It won't effect our travel. People with good immune systems don't get as sick as those who don't look after themselves.
"Crescent,That is rather highbrowed of you don't you think?One of the the reasons the WHO is so concerned about this flu is that it has killed those not usually impacted - healthy,younger adults - and that the mortality rates appear high.As this is still early in the progression of this flu, time is going to tell if this will be the next pandemic or if it will die off.Cheers,TC"
"Good precautions can help prevent getting sick, like taking Airborne (some studies now show it doesn't work, but I think it helps), drinking plenty of fluids (water is great), getting a good nights sleep before traveling (if possible), and I always wipe down my arm rests and tray table with bleach wipes when I get on the plane (I don't think these ever get cleaned). Also, wash your hands before eating. These things can help reduce your risk. Valid question as you sit in a small space with canned air for a long period of time. I read once that a cough spreads 25 feet from the person coughing. Makes me want to hold my breath when someone is coughing nearby. Ugh."
"maniac- good points. Air planes are filled with germs.Travelling around Asia you see alot of passengers with masks on. I wouldn`t wear a mask, but remember sars very well. "
" It is primarily in central Mexico and bit in California and Texas. But it is a traveling, jet set, world. If you goint anywhere in the next week or two and it isn't Mexico, I wouldn't get too worked up about it. Right now I would say Punta Cana should be pretty safe and don't worry about it at this time. In 3 or 4 weeks from now, who knows?"
"I'm really worried about this - mainly because I'm traveling with children and I'm worried they will get this flu. We are travelling in 4 weeks time, so lets just say one of us gets poorly whilst there, how good/quick are the doctors for treating this type of thing. "
"Going in 3 weeks from today, to Mexico of all places...just for a change of venue and some comparisons for Punta Cana, beside the deal was too good to turn down and I have never been to Cabo San Lucas."
Not sure what to make of it just yet.cbc.ca/world/…
"Confirmed cases in NY and in New Zealand, but the people affected were recently in Mexico. I guess we should load up on masks!"
Now supposedly Nova Scotia has confirmed cases - by the way thanks for the link Deb.Not sure how concerned/upset we should be either - but I sure as he11 am watching this closely.It will affect travel - but by how much - we will have to see how this plays out in our world.Keep safe and healthy people - LeighP.S. The facebook annoyance seems to be gone-yahoo.
 With this new virus going on hard in Mexico... Going to Mexico right now would not be big on my list at this time. 
Mexico is def not on my list right now! I am thinking masks and hand sanitizers for a while. (especially traveling) I may look retarded but I will be as safe as possible! LOL
Well we are going two weeks on Tuesday and have no worries at all at this stage
We are going in a little bit over a month. I don't know what to think of it now?
"We are travelling the first week of June, if there are any known cases in DR I wont be travelling as I will be 5 months pregnant and feel taking an extra risks would be foolish.I hate sounding like one of those people who panic at the slightest thing and I understand that the probability of it being in the UK is high but there isnt much I can do about that.Let's hope it dies out as quick as it started!"
"New Zealand has not confirmed cases of swine flu.Merely suspected.Today suspected swine flu cases were being monitored and some were being treated with Tamiflu as a precaution.It will not be known until later this week, when test results come back from Melbourne , whether any of them have swine flu.Apart from Mexico , cases of swine flu have been confirmed or are suspected in countries including the United States, Canada, Spain, France, Israel and Brazil."
"Hello,As there are no reported outbreaks in the DR the risks of you catching the flu are probably no more or less thanif you stayed at home.The following, although a bit long, may be helpful:-The UK is on swine flu alert after the virus killed more than 100 people in Mexico and spread to the US and Canada. Medical teams are working out ways to prevent the spread of the new human strain of the virus usually associated with pigs and Government officials have met for emergency discussions.A Department of Health spokeswoman said the outbreak was 'unusual and of concern'.She said surveillance arrangements in the UK were being 'stepped up' but added: 'It is too early to make a complete assessment of the health implications of this new virus or if it could represent the appearance of a potential pandemic strain of influenza virus.'Health Protection Agency chiefs said it was 'sensible' to plan for cases in the UK.The Government said it has enough medicine to treat half the population.Two people are still undergoing tests in Lanarkshire after returning from Mexico with mild flu-like symptoms.The disease has claimed 103 lives in Mexico with as many as 1,600 carrying the virus. Cases have been confirmed in countries including the US, Spain and New Zealand.Passengers returning to Heathrow from Mexico City are being kept aboard their planes while health officials ask them if they feel unwell and assess anyone's symptoms and travel history.No cases of swine flu have been confirmed in Britain.The NHS has a stockpile of more than £500 million worth of the Tamiflu anti-viral drug which has proved effective on patients in Mexico, and scientists are working on developing a vaccine against the new strain, said Mr Johnson.The Department of Health said it had stepped up surveillance arrangements, adding that the UK has enough antiviral stocks to provide treatment for 50 per cent of the population should they become ill.'We put plans in place earlier this year to increase supplies of flu drugs, making the UK one of the most prepared countries in the world,' a spokesman said.'Agreements made with Roche and GlaxoSmithKline earlier this year doubled our antiviral stockpiles. The contracts brought our total capacity to 33.5 million treatment courses.'Under the civil contingencies committee system - known as Cobra - cross-departmental representatives met to plan how to deal with any outbreak.As the World Bank provided Mexico with more than £136 million in loans to help it deal with the outbreak, the World Health Organisation warned countries around the world to look out for unusual flu cases as the virus spread from the central American country.WHO director-general Margaret Chan said the outbreak, caused when the H1N1 strain associated with pigs crossed over to the human population, constituted a 'public health emergency of international concern'.Nations will be expected to step up reporting and surveillance of the contagious respiratory disease, which she said had 'pandemic potential'."
"Personally, I do not think the FCO or WHO will restrict travel.One thought for all the people from the UK that are panicking - if we get some confirmed cases here in the UK, which we will, are you going to leave the country?"
"Hello Everyone, CNN this morning just stated that most major airlines in U.S. will waive re-booking fees till the beginning of May...that is good news....Hope the travel agencies do the same....Looks like wife and I lucked-out...went to Mexico in late March before this hit.... Think we will go to Scotland this summer and camp-out in the Highlands with the sheep....lol.. CNN: Spain has one case now...so Europe will have it...Global travel, means global problems...Everyone take care and of course have a cold one or two...etc... Best Regards, Paul and Sherry"
"Hi AllMy biggest worry is my kids - I just don't want them to be sick. I'm making sure we are all taking our vits etc but then I find out today the young heathly ones are more prone to be taken down by this virus - I'm just worried. My biggest concern is the flight - I'll be taking the anti-bactrial wipes as someone mentioned on here and the gel for our hands but I'm still worried. It's like we don't know where that plane has flone recently, it might have been Mexico and it might have had someone sat on the seat with this virus. I've been told about Vicks First Defence too - anyone used this before? Only problem is, it's only for children aged 12 and over and I've a 4 year old.Will anyone be wearing masks at airports etc? "
"I am starting to worry now, fly out 4 weeks on weds and getting married in punta cana. Been booked for 12 months and i really dont wanna have to cancel but would be stupid to go if dangerous. However, i do believe things can be blown so out of proportion so gonna hold fire for the time being. I know people are already being screened so prob as much chance of catching it here as over there. Besides, in 4 weeks it could of all blown over. "
"I have to admit that it surprises me BIG TIME how some people worry about what they don't have to worry, and don't worry when in fact they should !There are NO CASES IN DR. Worry about if you are aborad, not here in the DR at last.Its ironic.... all this time worring about alleged diseases you ""might find"" in DR, and now travellers have to worry about BEING OR NOT BEING ALLOWED to enter the Dominican Republic. "
"Monica- what do you mean by ""being or not being allowed in DR""? Don't mean to sound dumb, just don't know if i missed something here...."
"I have been keeping a close eye on this. I am a bit less worried because we are at the end of the normal flu season and HEAT kills the virus. It looks like this year we will probably be just fine, and they are already working on a vaccine for next year. Thanks for all the chatter on this! Very helpful and interesting! "
"Dominican Authorities have decided to use their right ""to reserve their right of admission"" to any foreigner coming from one of the affected countries with the flu, with signs of being sick.Its over the radio programs, and local news. Any person arriving the country, from infested countries, WITH ANY SYMPOTMS OF BEING SICK, won't be allowed in and sent back in the same plane.www.elnuevodiario.com.do/app/article.aspx… "
"I think that precaution would be the best plan of action. Maniac made some great suggestions. I notice alot of people are still not considerate of others, they cough or sneeze and not into their elbow which is much more sanitary than into your hands. Some still just let it into the air with no care to others!So far all the cases have been travellers that have gone to Mexico ( stay away from anyone who you know has been there)Thank you Maniac, I am definitely going to bring some wipes for on the plane, planes are just breeding grounds for germs.Everyone stay healthy and safe. Keep watching reports, it's all we can do."
"I guess Lysol is selling like crazy these days...If I was to get in a plane theses days I would defenetelly bring some antibacterial gel and wipe my and my families tables, arm rests, and cutlery.Toilet...I would try not to use it..."
"I'm not as worried about catching it in the DR as I am about being exposed while traveling there. My mom wants me to wear a face mask. I will plan to clean surfaces as I go and will up my regular handwashing but I haven't really believed in antibacterial gel for hands since I rely on my body's good bacteria too much.I think we have to be aware that it only takes one carrier to transfer the ""germs"" somewhere. Maybe there are no reported cases of it in the DR, but one could be infected now or soon (or never). I think being aware and being diligent about taking care of your health doesn't equate to blowing something out of proportion, nor does a more laid back approach mean that you aren't taking it seriously. I think our different personality types will dictate how we handle it and how we perceive others to be handling it.Kaki"
Wise Words Kaki - as usual.
A handful of countries have placed travel advisories against Canada due to the 6-case outbreak...…mytelus.com/telusen/portal/NewsChannel.aspx…
"I agree with Kaki. I rely on my own bodies defenses and I also agree that ""sometimes"" media blows things up, it's their job, they did it with SARS as well."
Going to DR in 3 weeks... Heh it seems that for once my crappy immune system helps me! YAY! :) (I have a genetic immune deficiency syndrome...)
"I live in N.S. about an hour and a half from the town where the 4 cases have been confirmed.I believe that all 4 cases are students who have recently travelled to Mexico.They are at a private boarding school.If all 4 cases are kids who were in Mexico, then maybe it`s not spreading as quickly as thought...I guess we`ll soon see, if kids who didn`t go on the trip start comming down with it in the next few days...I have to say it does concern me as I have a 5 year old with a poor immune system who catches everything. He has a cold now and they can last several weeks with him, so I`m scared that if he comes down with something more we wouldn`t catch it quickly...I`m also travelling to the DR in July and hope that by then swine flu will be a memory."
"I just watched Dr. Oz say that antibacterial wipes or gels are your best defense and that the masks that they are handing out do little to no good unless someone sneezes in your face.He also said that we should prepare ourselves in case kids are not able to go to school and we are not able to go to work...In other words, stock up on essentials. He said that we would know by Friday what course this flu would take and what would need to be done.Another thing he said that we should not be afraid to travel to other countries but that the travel itself would pose the most risk...as in having affected people on the plane or trains etc."
"""I have been keeping a close eye on this. I am a bit less worried because we are at the end of the normal flu season and HEAT kills the virus. It looks like this year we will probably be just fine, and they are already working on a vaccine for next year.""Be very aware that there is no connection between seasonal flu and the pandemic flu (which this outbreak may or may not become).""I just watched Dr. Oz say that antibacterial wipes or gels are your best defense and that the masks that they are handing out do little to no good unless someone sneezes in your face.""Absolutely right. Normal masks of practically no use what-so-ever unless someone sneezes directly in your face from close range. Ant-bacterial wash and good hand washing hygiene is your best defence. So, for example, if you use the toilet on your flight, your biggest risk point will be the virus getting on to your hands when you un-fasten the lock and open the door! Using antibacterial hand wash once out of the toilet is a good idea, but of course, you can not carry this on board due to 'security restrictions'. Can you buy this flight side at the airport?It is a tough time for the tourist industry, this will make it even tougher."
"hfeatherWhy did not the heat In Mexico kill this virus then?.I,m not panicking anyone,nor myself but have just been speaking with my doctor,and with the now two confirmed cases In UK (Scotland),plus with Global travelling could be quite easily spreading to further Country's,therefore my Doctor Is advising not to travel to DR at the moment,(for how long,he cannot say!), If I/we where to travel then the onus would be ours and If we came down with the Virus whilst In DR then our Insurance would be Invalid!(because we travelled against Doctors Advice),and we could be facing some very expensive Medical fees or worse!!. I too am hoping It all Clears soon.tonky."
"""If I/we where to travel then the onus would be ours and If we came down with the Virus whilst In DR then our Insurance would be Invalid!(because we travelled against Doctors Advice),and we could be facing some very expensive Medical fees or worse!!""I doubt if this would be the case (although I'd probably call the travel insurance company and check!) At the moment there are no official warnings about travel so it is [currently] an individual opinion.We're about to book a three week trip to China for July which is a little worrying because that may well be at the height of any outbreak. I'm sure I'd rather be ill/treated at home. With a bit of luck, I'll have had it and recovered by then!"
You can buy individually packaged hand wipes for the plane and it would be a good idea to keep some in your pockets for grocery shopping too.
"Tonky - I grabbed this info (about the heat) from somewhere online:H1N1 virus is only survivable in sub tropic area - in particular during autumn and winter - such as North America. Indonesia is a tropical country so that the possibility for the virus to survive is relatively low, said Health Minister in press conference, Ministry of Public Welfare Coordination (Menkokesra) office, Jakarta, Monday (27/4). I don't know what the inner-city regions of MX maintain as far as temps go. Have been many times, but only to the coastal areas. I suppose I am trying to see the preverbial gold lining somewhere! Regardless, I am being safe. updates - EU issued a travel warning to USA/MX - 'caution' issued over travel to MX (I think that is a warning too. They just thought the word ""WARNING"" was too provocative)heather-heather "
"I'm traveling to Punta Cana in 3 weeks, and my doctor gave me an Rx for ""tamiflu"", just in case. "
"GAtravel - that is a GREAT idea! hopefully this will be just a memory in July, but if not I think I will take some Tamiflu with us."
"I would ask on what basis your doctor made that judgement call as the FCO, WHO & NHS websites have no such advisories"
"that is correct. However, they have found that tamiflu is effective with this flu. Who knows where this will be in 3 weeks? Better to be safe than sorry."
"I heard tamiflu was being used for this virus also, don't know how true or effective it is.Soooooooo, not to sound too lackadaisy, but has anyone seen any good last minute deals to PC or think there could be some coming in the near future? Sorry, if I sound a bit ""off"" today, it's been a doozy and could use a get-away.Cheers, Debbie"
"FYI..,the WHO has just raised their alert level to phase 4 from the previous phase 3(top being a 6)for nonessential travel to the US and Mexico for those areas reporting cases of this flu.What this actually means is anybodys guess,but it does seem that there is an increasing concern about this."
I hope the heat kills the virus :O) like right now!!!. We are headed to the Playa Del Carmen area in 3 weeks. We really do not want to cancel. We are playing the wait and see game thou.. we thought about switching locations but wherever you go you fly so it seems a bit pointless..unless of course the virus spreads to the resort areas in Mexico.
The FCO here in the UK have now advised against all but essential travel to Mexico.
The CDC has now issued the same warning against all non essential travel to Mexico.I feel bad for what this is going to do to the economy in Cancun and Playa Del Carmen. i really hope this blows over soon. Do any of you remember how long the Hong Kong flu back in 68 hung around? I was just a pup back then.-Brugal
"Another thing to think about is whether the destination country will allow us to travel to them if the number of cases increase or become deadly. I understand that there have been no reported cases in the DR, but there have in the US. We're traveling in June. Great idea about a prescription for tamiflu if the flu is still going strong."
I am also travelling to the Dom Rep at the end of May and am concerned that flights from the UK may be cancelled by the tour operators if any reports of Swine Flu are reported in the Dom Rep. This holiday has been booked for a year now for family and friends and it would be a major disappointment if this were to happen. Does anyone know of any reported cases in the Dom Rep?On the other hand if the UK have any reported cases of Swine Flu the Dom Rep might not accept flights from the UK!!!
According to the TA poll (left side of screen) 65% of travellers are NOT planning on changing their travel plans.Deb.
"Unfortunately they may not have much say in the matter. UK Agencies such as Thomas Cook and Thomson have started canceling all flights to Mexico, Thomas Cook until May 5th. I imagine others will be following. This could be catastrophic for Mexico, already undergoing difficulties with a poor economy and drug wars and the travel industry in general. I hope it doesn't make the short jump to the D.R. but I can't help but fear it will.-Brugal"
"HelloHopefully it won't spread to the DR, but if it does it looks like the UK travel companies may stop flights, extract from the UK news below -""Tour operator Thomson said it had cancelled two flights due to leave the UK today and flights due to operate to Mexico from tomorrow onwards are under discussion. It is bringing home all Thomson and First Choice holidaymakers already in Mexico.Meanwhile, Thomas Cook and Airtours, which have about 3,000 holidaymakers in the country, are also expected to suspend Mexico holidays."""
"tonky.There are no cases in the DR so your Doctor is not really qualified to advise you on that.If he says don't go to the DR he is saying don't go anywhere then.If you had an illness and didn't tell the insurers before you went then that would be different, but the no travel ban has to come from the Foreign Office for it to invalidate your insurance as far as I know.snooks"
"Snooky,My Doctor Is well qualified to advise me on my medical history past and present and all the medication I am taking,yes I have taken out exciting medical condition Insurance for certain conditions listed,to which I have declared and will be covered for.But my Doctor Is advising ""Me personally"" not to travel to places like Mexico,America, Canada and any places which are closest to these as In his opinion the virus could spread Fast In the next few weeks!,If I Ignore His advice and say DR when I travel has cases of the Swine flue?,and I become Infected needing hospital/medical treatment, or death, and I/we make a claim to the travel Insurance company!,(you know what Insurance company's are like!to get out of paying!!), If and they seek any medical history from my Doctor to my claim,he told me he has to be obliged to tell them that he did give me advice not to travel whilst the virus may still be prevalent!!.Then that could be a stupid expensive Risk on my part.Hope that this will not be the case and this Virus passes soonest,don't get me wrong that Is just His advice to Me. "
"Tonky,From an Insurance point of view the Doctor cannot dictate which Countries you should or should not go to as this is a contract between you and the Insurer.The Doctor is welcome to his opinion but he is not in charge of the Foreign Office and does not implement travel Policies, although he maybe of a different opinion. lolI am off to PC soon myself so hope it blows over too.If my Doctor told me where I should or should'nt go I would do likewise to him. :-))snooks"
I am going to be in DR end May and have no intention to change my plans. At this time flu cases are reported in my state (California) and none in DR so I have more of a chance catching the virus here at home than in DR!I am hoping that this whole thing fizzles out in the next couple of weeks.
"Hi everyoneApparently, so my pharmacist has told me, the department of health have frozen supplies of Tamiflu. I was enquiring about the price of a private precription. "
"Well said gownlady,"
"Still , and hopefully will stay like this, there is NOT ONE CASE ON THE FLUE IN DR."
"Maybe I am naive, but I am not too worried about getting the flu. What does concern me is what if we get there, then a hundred more cases of the swine flu are confirmed in a couple days, will they prevent my flight from returning to the States?We are scheduled to go to Puerto Vallarta on May 3rd.I want to go for five days, not an undetermined amount of time.Any thoughts on this?"
It wouldn't break my heart if I were stuck there for a few more days until things calmed down.There are worse places to get stranded like the mother-in laws house for instance.
jrj45 Ditto
" ""A medical historian at the University of Toronto, Edward Shorter, watched what was going on and called the phenomenon ""mass psychosis.""Although , I do not believe there is any problem regarding swine flu right now for people traveling to the DR. I believe people basing there travel plans on a report from Edward Shorter, a medical historian over the concerns of Doctors, Scientists and researchers at CDC, WHO , PAHO etc.. is ill advised.I also noticed a very significant paragraph in this article which may give some insight into Shorter's politics and motivation for the article. "" But Russia banned pork imports from Mexico. And Hong Kong has said it won't accept flights from Mexico. ""That's irrational, except to whip up public sentiment against the Mexicans,"" Shorter says.What the he// does that have to do with the history of pandemics???????People should just keep an eye on the developments of the next few weeks.Peace!"
"hfeather - I hope this virus will go away too since I will be going to DR, Puerto Plata to be exact. Hopefully everything will go down and taken care off. So nervous since there are 45 confirmed cases in NY."
"My wedding is July 25, and the next day we are leaving for our honeymoon in Punta Cana, and i'm really nervous now. Should we still go? I just don't know what to do...i know a romantic honeymoon isn't worth our lives (potentialy), but i'd be heartbroken if we couldn't go, as we've been planning it for months, and it was a wedding gift from my mother."
Crescent you are hilarious
"good posting Gownlady. We also travelled during sars-and saw many masks worn in Asia, but the media just goes on and on. I just returned from my Doctors office and couldn't believe the number of people who were coughing waiting to see the Doctor, and these people looked like they hadn't been anywhere but around here.  We love Cabo and will be leaving for there in few days. Being worried about getting sick while travelling has never kept us from travelling. "
