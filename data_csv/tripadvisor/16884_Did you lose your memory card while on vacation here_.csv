"A young couple was on vacation, it looks like a very extended holiday to Europe and South Africa as well, and a memory card was found in Campbell River, B.C. after doing a whale watching tourThe RCMP think that the couple is from the UKglobalnews.ca/news/…"
I believe they've been found.metronews.ca/news/…
Nope phpr I believe this a totally different couple; the original ones you are talking about had a family.
Geez ... it's a memory loss epidemic... LOL...

I know a lot of folks seem to lose their cards. I lost mine in Maui in February of all my pictures of Easter Island and Bora Bora. First (and last) time that will ever happen to me. I know how heartbreaking it is.
They were located and very happy to get it back.
Good news. Did they call the Visitors' Centre?
