"I have booked US domestic trips for my family and now family members are blocked outside of United States because of travel ban. When I contacted UA today, they told me they have no policy to refund virus related domestic trips. So does it mean that even if it is not the passenger's fault to be blocked outside of US, passenger still need to pay for the flight when he is banned outside US due to the virus?"
I would think a virus an act of god which airlines do not cover. Did you have travel insurance?
If you purchased your trip all on one ticket then a refund may have been possible. Have you considered delaying your trip? Maybe UA would consider changing your flights with a reasonable change fee.
Suggest you call again and ask to speak with a supervisor.
"I assume your relatives are being refunded the cost of their China - US tickets.On the domestic tix, do what someone already suggested and see if you can change them all to a later date when your family will be visiting (though will likely have to pay change fees and fare differentials, unless you can get that supervisor to waive them) and when you do that I would have in hand details on the relatives' original China-US bookings so you can prove the circumstances."
"Correct, if the airline is not the reason that you family can't make it, then they're not responsible for refunding the tickets they sold you. It's the same as if you'r family couldn't come because one of them was sick: the airline has no responsibility. As others have said, you can try calling again and you might get lucky if you ask VERY NICELY. They have no obligation, so definitely do not yell or demand. But they might give you a reschedule or even a refund if you explain that you would REALLY like to fly them again when your family is allowed to travel. But, ultimately, this is what travel insurance is for."
"I'm assuming the domestic tickets are completely separate from an international flight from China to the USA and the issue is not that the flight was cancelled, but that due to the new USA travel restrictions on visitors from China, the traveler has no way to get here to use the domestic ticket.This is a difficult one but I think UA is correct. These are consequential losses. It's not your fault but it's not United's either. It's the same as if you had a non-refundable hotel, or a cruise, or tickets to a play or sporting event in the USA and couldn't gt here to use those tickets.I think this is a situation for travel insurance. If you have it, contact your insurer to see if you can get a refund.you could also try calling UA again to talk to a different agent. Or contact them through the contact page on their website. Plead your case and maybe they'll waive the cancellation fee and give you a credit to use the flight at a later date. But they don't have to. This is really an issue for travel insurance I think."
"It isn't UA's fault, but they might have sympathy anyway. It is always worth a try to ask someone else or contact them through social media."
"UA is losing income due just to cancelled flights to China directly due to coronavirus. I doubt they would want to lose more due to people wanting refunds on flights unrelated directly to coronavirus. Insurance companies will likely be the same. Flyers probably at best might be able to pay a change or cancellation fee for flights they can’t take now and take credits for rhe balance on future flights. But, i believe those credits can only be used by the person named on the original ticket, so use of credits for a future flight might be limited. https:/…china-flights-suspended.amp.html"
Same issue with prepaid hotels. The refundable rates for both flights and hotels are expensive for a reason. The customer service staff at the airlines must be going crazy with all of the crazy requests.
"I think United Airlines is right. Travel waivers are not required by law, but just a nice gesture from the airlines. A domestic ticket between two points within the US is not affected by any travel ban, and no other airline is issuing travel waivers for this.Airlines are already taking a big hit from this virus situation."
"Always a danger when you book separate tickets. From how you've explained this, I feel United is completely within its bounds to not refund. You can hope you may find a sympathetic ear, but it was your risk when you booked an independent ticket, not United's.Good luck."
"There are lots of things in life that aren't the fault of the passenger or the airline. That is exactly when travel insurance comes into play. If there is no insurance or the situation is not covered, then it's time to say 'such is life' and move on."
have they spoken to their travel insurance company? (although not sure if you having paid for the flights affects a claim)
I agree - this is what travel insurance is for (providing your policy covers this sort of exceptional issue) . Just because your relative is not allowed into the USA at the moment to use the tickets does not mean that UA have any obligation to refund non refundable tickets - it is not their problem if the passengers will not be in the USA to use them. If insurance won't cover it the best hope is to see if UA will be very kind and re-arrange the flights for a later date - if not then the loss is irrecoverable IMO .
"When is this domestic trip? If it is not til April or May you may just want to wait and see.UA does not have to refund. But an intelligent response may be that they can offer a credit for rebooking in the future without fee change. It's unusual problem this 2019-nCoV, so an exception may be appropriate. Can it be looked as being similar to a medical problem exception?You would still need to give proof that they have made plans to travel to US.The chance of them coming and using tickets within a few months or a year may be low considering what is going on, and by being agreeable, UA probably won't lose much but may ""appear"" as customer friendly.Just saying"
"""That is exactly when travel insurance comes into play.""I think many people have false confidence in travel insurance. Other than the 'cancel for any reason' travel insurance (quite expensive), there is a lack of coverage. There is a lot of traffic on cruise forums where people have had a rude awakening when attempting to cancel under their travel insurance coverage.""Standard ""named perils"" policies usually exclude epidemics and pandemics"" quoted from:https:/…599e5efa4d64Edited: 3:18 pm, February 03, 2020 "
"Clearly you need to read the policy, but the article you linked doesn’t cover the OPs situation. They’re not afraid to travel or cancelling because they want to. They physically can’t get to the USA to take the domestic flight because travelers from China can’t get into the USA right now. I suspect that would be covered under many policies."
Understand the airline refund policy but there is no way you know if there is a hidden affected passenger in any flight and in a closed environment. Airlines should take precaution and responsibility to fully refund anyone don’t feel comfortable to fly in any international and domestic flights. The virus is very strong and can spread very fast
">> The virus is very strong and can spread very fast<<I think the same could be said about lots of viruses/sickness across the world. Have you heard about the current flu outbreak in the US (around 10,000 deaths estimated)? https:/…preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm>>Airlines should take precaution and responsibility to fully refund anyone don’t feel comfortable to fly in any international and domestic flights. <<Imagine if they did that, then anyone could cite any illness affecting people anywhere in the world"
"mpk, I suspect that many people have simply bought poor travel insurance without properly examining the details. Things are different in he UK to the US, but one of the things that I think is very similar is that insurance offered through airlines, cruise lines and other retailers tends not to be particularly good.But people buy it anyway because of the magic word 'insurance' and because i's convenient."
Their website states they will refund Chinese trips. Check again
"wes032, the fact that OP’s relatives can’t physically get to the States to use the domestic flight tickets is nothing to do with the airline and certainly not something for which they are responsible. It’s unfortunate and very disappointing but unless they can re-plan and use the tickets at a later date, or the travel ban is rescinded it’s just one of those unforeseeable risks.I would be very surprised if many standard insurance policies would cover it."
"@ Post 21 (Danica73) but the point is that this isn't a Chinese trip - it is internal flights within the USA that the people booked onto them cannot use because they are not allowed into the USA at the moment due to the travel ban - a totally different thing altogether!Edited: 1:53 pm, February 08, 2020 "
If you bought 1 tkt including international and domestic then you will get a full refund.
"Hong - the OP states they have bought ""US domestic flights"".....not international flights with a US elementThis is a standalone US domestic flight. There would be no issue getting refund if it was attached to a China international flight....but it is not"

"If the travel ban has been ordered by the US Government, then it's nothing to do with UA, and travel insurance usually has a 'government action' clause so they don't have to pay out.As others have said, you need to contact UA, and see what they can/will do to help."
Yes it seems united and cheapoair will not refund my ticket so i have to go threw the screening process 3 ur before my flight.. i hope i dont get corona on my trip. Thanks cheapo!
"#29 - this is not the same situation as the OP posted. If your flight wasn't canceled, you aren't due a refund, are you? Did you look at your itinerary on UA's webpage and see if you were eligible for a refund?If not, you can chose not to take this trip."
United has offered no service charge to delay all flights for whatever reason for one year. You can cancel your current booking and rebook within one year without penalty. Check the UA website for details.
"whatever their reason they should offer to let them reschedule a trip without change fees.United will feel the lack of business if they don't do this. I for one would never fly an airline that would not waive the fees for these reasons, it's just not good business. Delta is waiving fees."
"Safari, you are several days behind on the news regarding UA and other US carriers allowing passengers to change flight arrangements without paying the normal change fee, as indicated in post #31. If you read other posts in the forum, there are others flying on airlines other than UA that are experiencing difficulties in changing their tickets. The airlines are overwhelmed with trying to deal with the situation. What happens if everyone takes your attitude? They'll be no airlines left to fly. Find it interesting that you have no location in your profile, so we have no idea if UA evens services your location. Also, this is what you choose to make your first forum post about, after joining almost 12 years ago?"
"From post 32 ==>""United will feel the lack of business if they don't do this. I for one would never fly an airline that would not waive the fees for these reasons,...""<==No, they won't. Once we get past the hysteria, any perceived offense will be long forgotten... UA3411?"
"They are offering credit to use within 1 year for another trip and they are waving the change fees. You will have to pay the difference in airfare for new trip. Additionally, they cannot refund the tax paid on the trip which is annoying."
"I am in a similar situation. I have no answer to this question, but I would like to share my thoughts on this topic. Sometimes fault is not at issue but good customer relations. United Airlines would clearly lose a lot of money if they refunded the ticket, but what if they offered a full credit (no cancellation fee) for the customer to use within the next year or two? Why does it have to be ONLY in the original name? Once UA has the the money it doesn't matter who redeems the credit. Yes this solution will affect the projected income of future sales, but not to too great an extent."
UA is waiving the change fee ONLY if the ticket was purchased between March 3 and March 30. I bought my ticket Feb 28
"Is there a travel ban on flights from Pearson International Airport in Toronto, Ontario, Canada to Albany International Airport in Albany International Airport in New York, USA on April 1, 2020"
"They will not refund, but they are giving full credit even for basic tickets that are non changeable. I thought this was quite generous, as they did nothing wrong and I elected to buy a non changeable ticket and cancel."
I was booked on Virgin to fly today to Memphis - 3 of us paid £460. We have flown many times there and thats the average we always pay. The travel ban stopped us flying - but today the travel agent have come back saying the airline will change us to new dates but we need to pay £898 EACH for the new far??????????? How can that be allowed !!!!!!!! We wont be paying that as we couldnt afford it but we have now lost our original fare of £460 each. So upset at this.
"I have a Board Meeting in Switzerland for a specific time and date. United canceled the flight and cannot get me there for the meeting. They will not refund the ticket--only give me credit for a future flight. If this was a vacation, I get it. But the meeting is when it is--not at some time in the future. Can they get away with that? (I've got 613,520 lifetime miles--not a lot but still)"
"The same thing has been told to us. United CAN refund but are choosing not to. When I asked for a manager after holding for 2 hours & 34 minutes, they disconnected me. My husbands employer has closed for at least 2 weeks & we now need the money that we were going to use for vacation but United Airlines is taking advantage of this pandemic! They don’t have to fly the planes but get to keep our money - as if I would ever choose their airline again!! There HAS to be help somewhere!! Attorney General???"
"#40 - Was your flight canceled? Could these fees be those charged by your third party ticket broker, not the airline (no matter what the ticket broker tells you). Read the terms and conditions associated with your ticket.#41 - if your flight has been canceled, you are entitled to a full refund, you do not have to accept a voucher. I don't understand why you have not been offered a refund.#42 - you have not provided any details. But, if this is a US domestic flight and it hasn't been canceled, you are not due a refund. This is not illegal.Edited: 8:03 am, March 20, 2020 "
"#42, it's a pretty standard travel insurance provision to allow for cancellation in the event the traveller loses their job. What does your policy say?"
"Read the whole article to have a clear understanding of what's going on at United -- https:/…==>""United Airlines has now updated their flight change policy again, for literally the fourth time since March 6.With United’s new schedule change policy, for international flights where travel is disrupted by more than six hours because of schedule changes resulting from government restrictions:• Customers will get a credit valid for a year• At the end of those 12 months, if the customer doesn’t use the credit they can get a refund to their credit card""<=="
"I was due to fly out to the USA on the 18th March for a surprise birthday, and the travel restrictions were imposed.I have written to United and they have said that I cannot get a refund, as the tickets were “non-refundable” and I can rebook within a year.I have since written back to them to say that I will not be flying to the USA again as it was a surprise birthday.They are being adamant that a refund will not be made.They are just keeping the money building up their bank balance.I would give Customer service a score of -10/10."
"Pank M - you accept that the ticket was non refundable but say that UA are offering you a free change of date - that is ALL you are going to get ( and it is probably far more than they would offer in normal times on a ""non refundable"" ticket) . The flight went ahead so far as I can see from your post - so no there is no entitlement to a refund. Just because you found yourself unable to travel is irrelevant to UA - they are not withholding your money - you simply do not qualify for a refund! . Airlines are never obliged to ensure that the people who book to fly with them are entitled to enter the US - that is something the customer has to ensure themselves in order to avoid being denied boarding when they turn up at the airport. The situation you describe is something which might trigger an entitlement to a claim on your travel insurance provided of course you had insurance and if the policy was bought before C.Virus issues became an excluded risk. As I see it you have two options apart from claiming on your travel insurance - (1) swallow the loss and put it behind you , or (2) take the free rebook for a later date offer - it is entirely your choice but please do not say that UA are being unfair to youEdited: 1:12 pm, March 23, 2020 "
"IMO the airlines in most instances are being quite generous by waiving change fees and offering vouchers for a year, some only within a year from the original date of purchase. Normally it would cost about $200 or more per ticket to change a flight. If a flight is cancelled, then a refund would be appropriate but will certainly take a long time to process. You purchased a non-refundable ticket, which means you are not entitled to a refund, only a voucher or change of date. While it's no fault of yours that this situation has occurred, it is also not the fault of the airlines. The airlines are hemorrhaging money and can not refund everyone who can't or won't fly right now. There are hundreds of thousands of people who have had their travel plans disrupted (me included) and it is unrealistic to think that everyone will be made whole financially because of this pandemic. Certainly those who chose to self-insure won't. Even those who bought travel insurance may find out that they are not covered for pandemics. It's a painful situation for many, but there is little anyone can do but work with the cancellation & change policies that the airlines, tour companies, and cruise lines have established.Hopefully your travel insurance, if you bought any, may be of some help."
"There are some very mixed messages being put on this forum the past week or so - some are saying that airlines are mandated to provide full refunds, others that offering vouchers or change of dates on non-refundable tickets are as much as they are going to get.I have been insulted because I suggested that airlines are not legally obligated to provide full refunds, due to the fact that they are not being permitted to fly and it's thus not their fault.So what, truly, is the case? Is it different for tickets that are covered by EU 261?"
"I *think* yes to your last paragrahp but think otherwise it's up to the airline, their policies/term or local legislation, TBNY.SWT"
"There is a huge difference between entitlement if a flight is cancelled and the situation where a passenger finds themselves disinclined to use their booked ticket because of a change of mind, not having correct entry status etc. TBH I am getting very tired of people bleating all over the forums about not getting all their money back because their travel plans have gone awry due to issues relating to the coronavirus epidemic - the common thread is the expectation that anyone should be out of pocket except them - it doesn't matter who or why as long as they get 100% of their cash back .You need to get a grip folks, the reality is that sometimes in this life you lose out even if it is not your fault . This global crisis means that plans get spoilt and it is nobodies fault except the virus and you cannot sue that . Even if you have decent travel insurance that invariably carries has an excess on it so again you will not recover everything.Edited: 3:14 pm, March 23, 2020 "

"""it doesn't matter who or why as long as they get 100% of their cash back""I am seeing that more and more.
