"We had plans to visit Sao Miguel, end of July. We are still hopeful if it is safe to do so for my family and those I connect with. I am mindful that travel restrictions are in place. Is there a forum or website that details entry protocol when tourism resumes?"
"Hi,you can find newest information regarding entry procedures for example at https:/…alerts-and-informations.To be honest, I don't like them (I also plan to come to Azores in July)."
I also have plans for end of July but if these rules are in place at the time its not worth the trip you still have to self isolate for 14 days.
"Since last sunday the Azores have 4 different ""approaches"" to those arriving to the region: The first is to carry out a SARS-CoV-2 virus test within 72 hours before the flight departed for the Azores and the result was negative.Second option: consists of performing the screening test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus at the moment it disembarks. Then you will be taken to a hotel determined by the Regional Government of the Azores, where you have the obligation to remain in prophylactic isolation, until the result of the test. The maximum time limit for transmitting your test result is 48 hours.third option: voluntary quarantine for a consecutive period of fourteen days in a hotel indicated for this purposefourth option, which is to return to the place of origin of your flight or to travel to any airport outside the Autonomous Region of the Azores.Official communication in portuguese https:/…A7ores.pdf"

Is this protocol set in stone - yes. when is it being re- evaluated? Good only knows...
If you choose option 1 or 2 you still have to self isolate even after being tested negative. The only diference from the first measures are that you can leave if you are on a shorter stay. I have trip for last week in July I am checking up on measures because if these are law at that time its not worth to travel.
