yes I would be careful leaving your luggage in the mini van. Car break in's seem to be an epidemic.
">>>Henry Cowell State Park(should we stop with luggage in mini van?)<<<Generally speaking, Henry Cowell is not a place you would expect a car break-in. It is a quiet, serene redwood forest, not a ""touristy"" place where thieves would be hanging around looking for loot. I would feel OK with leaving luggage for a short time, especially if you park near the Visitor's Center.  If this is not your own minivan, check to see if your rental has a pull-over thing in the back to cover your luggage so that it is not obvious. Ours does. If not, and you can pay extra to have one, I would do it.My daughter leaves her expensive bicycle in her SUV covered with a blanket...pretty obvious that something valuable is there....but so far it has worked for her. A dilemma (???)>>>>Are we going to be sorry if we skip Hearst Castle? The guys like architecture and enjoyed Frank Lloyd Wright tours in the past<<<In that case, yes, you might be sorry. The architect, Julia Morgan, was important in California, not only because she was a female, but because she left many beautiful buildings. If the guys are into architecture, they might want to read up on her before you come.Edited: 4 years ago "
I think your guys might want to read this...https:/….V2N69zVQCBEHave a great trip.
"Short term rentals are illegal in Carmel. I would re-think your lodging option. If your host gets caught between now and your visit, you could end up losing your money and, worse, a place to stay.Edited: 4 years ago "
"Wow, thank you this is a great link! I've struggled with timing Hearst visit. I'm thinking going straight there on Friday morning and giving us the opportunity to travel back up the coast to revisit any fave spots."
Thank you for the words of encouragement. I can assure you it's all on the up and up.

If your AirBnB is within the city limits of Carmel it is absolutely illegal. If it has a Carmel address but is outside the city limits it's in iffy territory. The county is sending mixed signals about vacation rentals with selective enforcement as it tries to develop an updated policy.Your safest bet is Pacific Grove where vacation rentals are legal and regulated by the city.-Mr. Toywww.montereypeninsula.infoEdited: 4 years ago 
"If you decide see Hearst, I wouldn't try to cram it in on with everything else on your Wednesday. You've already got a full schedule, and adding Hearst shortens your time for those things, adds time to the drive, and means you won't have time to linger at Hearst."
"Rental cars have little bar codes on them which makes them targets. I wouldn't leave anything inside it.Pay attention to the experts for the area regarding vacation rentals. There is push back in many areas about them. Believe it or not, not everyone wants an unknown family of 5 moving in next door. More and more communities are severely restricting them. Or banning them altogether."
"White D, Mr. Toy,Kibbles....you got me I grabbed Carmel out of the air to be more obscure. I don't really have any lodging questions, but thank you for showing concern. I'm hoping for some suggestions to best use our time in the area- it looks like such a beautiful place. This fun unknown family of 5 will not be a nuisance to any neighbors, as Midwest nice can go a long way."
Excellent read. Thanks for posting!
"For a lot of the places, you are not going to spend as much time as you have allotted. For example, McWay Falls is a photo op, you will only be there 15 minutes at most. I suggest driving all the way straight to Hearst and touring it. Then on the way back up, stop at the places you have listed. If you run out of daylight, you can drive back down to any of them without having to go the complete way down to Hearst. Does that make sense? Second day for example, drive to Nepenthe for breakfast and enjoy the views and then see the places north of Big Sur. You are going to be sorry if you skip Hearst. Close to Hearst is the Elephant Seal Sanctuary. This is a quick 15 minute stop north of Hearst. http://www.elephantseal.org/"
"Fred, I don't understand your snark... whether or not you asked about lodging, why would you not want to know that the lodging type you mentioned is illegal there? Once you know that, it's up to you to assume the risk or not. But if there were a problem and you posted a complaint, and the responses were, ""Well, that's one of the problems with an illegal rental"", it would be very understandable if your reply was, ""Well then, why didn't somebody tell me?"" And nobody was saying YOUR family would be a problem, but people in many cities don't want new random neighbors every night. Especially when the next occupants might not be a nice Midwestern family but a bunch of noisy frat brothers on spring break."
