News reports 12 Egyptians working on cruise tested positive Coronavirus and are quarantined after being infected by American. Anyone know which cruise ship or further details? (We’re supposed to fly to Egypt in a couple weeks & trek Mayfair Esplanade Cruise - Yikes!)
"Egypt attracts many Italians and Asians and Americans ...it was expected that these cruises would report cases sooner rather than later. In all honesty the exact line won't make much difference. I think tour operators will be looking at this in the next week. If fights are operating freely in the Egypt market from so many ""hot spots"" expect more.Edited: 9:15 am, March 06, 2020 "

Had the US citizen not tested positive and mentioned the Egypt cruise would any have been tested? Frankly I don't think so....you can't test the whole world. Thanks for the info.
also expected to go on a cruise in 2 weeks from Luxor to Aswan. Yeeks! Not sure what to do.
"Would love to hear as others decide what to do & why ...Edited: 4:39 pm, March 06, 2020 "
We are also on a nile cruise in 2 weeks from luxor to aswan and back to luxor.
"I read that they were infected by a person from Taiwan. They quarantined the ship and crew upon being notified about the infected person from Taiwan. The 12 tested positive on the 14th day of their quarantine. The ship, the River A., was moved to a non port area in Luxor to be disinfected. Seems very responsive and responsible of Egypt. We’re heading over a week from Tuesday and a cruise is part of our trip. I live in the US, there’s no “positive” cases in my state but I have no doubt I’m walking amongst infected people. Can’t stop this, we have to live our lives. I hope you go and have a wonderful experience."
"This NYT article (below) says the infected boat was the MS A Sara, which I see is often used by Gate 1 Travel, and it appears that agency has cancelled all trips to Egypt through May. We’re pretty young and healthy so I’m not afraid of our own dire health consequences, but my fear is getting quarantined for 2 weeks in Egypt or spreading to other people.This NYT article says the tourist sites are pretty empty. Are people seeing that? A lot to think about / figure out ... Would love to hear other travelers thoughts re their upcoming plans.https:/…egypt-nile-coronavirus.htmlhttps:/…coronavirus"
I am certainly going if allowed as I have waited for this trip of a lifetime for a year now. I am even missing the birth of my first grandchildren (TWINS) while we are there.
Awesome - Enjoy your trip! And congratulations on becoming a grandparent!It’s helpful to hear from others with similar dilemmas as we still decide for ourselves :)Of course you know this - but please don’t hold those newborn babies for a while after you return! That’s not worth the risk :)
We have the same dilemma as we are scheduled to leave in 3 weeks. We are still planning to go unless our trip or flight is cancelled by the tour company.
Good to hear - Enjoy!
"Thansk for all the updates! My husband and I have still not deciede but we're expected to leave March 19 and part of our trip will include a 3 day cruise on the Nile. Would be so so disappointed to not go since we've had the trip planned for a year and it's a belated graduation and 5 year anniversary gfit to ourselves. But it's hard to know what to do with so much conflicting info out there. Also, we live in NYC where we have 30 something cases already so it's not like we're not at risk here, either. We'll continue to wait it out to see what happens this week =( Our tour company said travel is going on as scheduled.Edited: 12:19 pm, March 07, 2020 "
Thanks - Keep us updated!

"Leaving tomorrow for Jordan then Egypt...Edited: 3:48 pm, March 07, 2020 "
Keep us updated on how it is on the ground in Egypt and anything you see we should consider. Helpful to hear from tourists who are actually there! (PS We fly through Jordan airport both directions on Royal Jordanian Air)
All sights were very busy as usual 2 weeks ago
I was on a DIFFERENT boat at the same time this was happening on the Sara. the tourist sites were very crowded - I'd relish the chance to go now instead when they will be much emptier. I'd still go.
"My daughter and I are supposed to start a cruise on March 16 (in a week). I'm not a nervous traveler, but this is a difficult decision. Extended quarantine on a nile cruise ship does not sound like fun."
I am in the same boat (no pun intended) in that my flight to Egypt is end of March and I do not want to cancel. Everyone thinks I’m crazy to go to Egypt with the virus ever present. What to do. Will decide soon but these posts are promising and give me incentive to continue with my travel plans.
"Has anyone heard from their tour company or cruise line? Are they testing employees and passengers before boarding? Taking special action regarding sanitization and food (buffets don’t seem like a good idea ...). I’m wondering if it makes sense to cancel cruise and do hotels and drivers instead. Not sure would get cruise deposit back, but may be worth it ..."
off tomorrow morning Hurgadah firs for couple of days then on to Luxor for trip down the Nile 5th time (we love it) will report back in a week
"good luck and report back. I booked a trip a couple of weeks ago before this became more of a concern for October 2020. Took trip cancellation for any reason insurance. Already have seen that United is allowing me travelers to change reservation for one year with no charge. I've wanted this trip forever and nearly went 10 years ago and then Arab Spring thing occurred. Big bucket list item, but safety is certainly first."
"Those of you booked on a cruise should be aware that US Dept. of State has just updated warnings...are warning US citizens not to take cruises https:/…cruise-ship-passengers.htmlShould something happen you may not get help.Edited: 7:19 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"I have not yet heard back from our tour company, but received email response directly from Mayfair MS Esplanade cruise regarding precautions they are taking re crew health and boat sanitization. They also said if we desire to cancel they will provide full refund. Very helpful! I see Viking has same policy. Not sure re other cruise lines."
Go check out @mattswider on Twitter. He’s an American being quarantined on Nile cruise ship and he’s tweeting about it.
Re Matt’s Twitter from quarantine - I wouldn’t want to be him. I am following ... something to consider
I will certainly not be going anywhere near them till I know we have nothing even if we stay away 3-4 weeks to be sure.
"The phrase about rats & sinking ship came to mind, but I can't really blame them!…ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/364906/Egypt/…"
"Based on US State Depart recommendations and other new info, we’re not going to cruise. Wondering if it might make sense to try to get our tour company to rework our private tour using hotels & drivers instead, or if we should just give up and not go. It’s a lot of money to lose, but would be bigger cost if we end up quarantined in Egypt. But I still really want to make this work if it can make sense. So hard to figure out!!!!"
"The way it’s going, I’d ask the tour company to rework your package with drivers etc. The company should be happy to help and, should you find they’re not, insist.Edited: 3:16 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"You get to see more by road anyway, so not so bad."
Using the road you could choose from at least some of the sites shown here https:/…No.Cruise.Boat.Required.html
"The whole situation is so fluid at the moment. Many governments are updating and changing their strategies and advice fairly regularly.It would seem to me that hotels too will soon become areas where there are cases of Coronavirus - much as it saddens me to say it. Tests have already been taking place today in some locations. If I had a booking to go in the near future, I would be checking my cancellation and insurance policies. It would possibly be better not to actually cancel but wait for the company to cancel it for you. It's a very confusing situation all round as far as I'm concerned - How to act responsibly and not over act can be a very delicate balancing act."
"Gate One ship I was told. All their trips have been cancelled. I am booked for a Viking River cruise. Do you think it is safe to travel to Egypt at this time? I can cancel our trip. We were to start in Israel. Israel today has made it that all visitors must go through a 14 day quarantine so I'm sure that part of our trip will be cancelled. I would love to come but I don't want to get stuck in a quarantine in a hotel or on boat. Any locals have any idea of the situation as of today?Edited: 7:02 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Excellent, as I am booked on the Mayflower in Oct. good to know they are handling well."
Well with Israel having 14 day quarantine and rumors of Jordan closing it’s borders we are thinking of cancelling our trip. Dr coming into hotels to swab people you could get stuck in Egypt. We are waiting to see what Viking does with our trip. I’m thinking they will cancel. Too many unknowns. I’m not afraid of the virus but am afraid of getting stuck in Egypt in a hotel in quarantine which is on your own dime.
"What about getting stuck in Egypt and not being able to get back to the US or quarantined as things do change overnight like how it escalated with the cruise. I’m worried that flights get called off last min while we’re there. Is that possible? How and where can I validate what measures are taken in Egypt airports now and back when we return to the US and tell them we’re back from Egypt? What will the US airport test for? Did Egypt stop its flights to the most infected countries (chinA, S. Korea etc)? We have a trip planned for April 2nd with a long layover (12 hours) in Paris and was planning to visit the city for 8 hours. Our trip ends on April 14th From Cairo. Planned to visit abs, Aswan and Luxor. I feel a lot could change overnight and plenty of what ifs. Traveling with 2 kids. Can’t even tell what my gut is telling me to do lol. Plz keep us posted how u will proceed. Our airlines guaranteed us vouchers and full refund on EGYPTAIR if we change our minds and same with the hotels. We’re going to wait a week before our flight to make a final decision and will watch this firm For further updates daily in hopes to make the right decision. I’m worried less about Egypt and more Concerned with the airport crowds/sight crowds with two kids (9 &2). Like everyone else this is a long waited for trip and high on the bucket list; hate for it to be cancelled :’("
Cruise ships are one of the the worst place where you can catch an infection due to a virus or any other reason. A person has to be completely crazy to take a cruise with the Coronavirus epidemic around the world.
"Like someone said this situation is very fluid, it's a wait and see what happens re further travel restrictions by airlines and Countries.Personally I would not be going on a cruise anywhere at the moment. I am only really worried about the flight as you are sitting ducks really, germs in a capsule.# 39 Egyptair did stop flights to / from China in early Feb but I think it was too late by then. Much like many other countires they didn't act quickly enough to contain it."
"Would you be able to afford to lose £3500 if you weren't going to be refunded, I don't think so. I certainly can't."
"The whole situation is a changing so fast across the world as the virus moves from country to country and as lessons are being learnt about it.  To my mind, it really is a case of keeping up to date with all local and international news as much as possible; knowing your own booking/cancellation and insurance details; considering possible outcomes based on present patterns; making a decision based on all of that and your own personal (gut?) thoughts.There has been mention of travelling with children, and naturally parents will be particularly concerned for them. It would appear that this virus is not unduly affecting children, of course there are always going to be exceptions but as with the adult population these are likely to be cases where there other health conditions. So the concern should be not so much about them catching the virus but what would happen to them if you became ill."
"It's safe seriously it's a media issues , and if you think of changing the cruise you still can do same sights but by road and you will be visiting same sights without missing any"
"luxorforyou, I think it is a bit more than 'media issues'.I appreciate you want to protect the tourist industry in Luxor and Egypt as a whole, especially as you work in the industry. However, down playing the coronavirus is a negative step and could have much more long lasting effect on the industry - something that no one wants to see. This virus is happening like a wave that hasn't fully hit some shores yet. People have to be aware of it, and the implications, especially when travelling so far from their homes. It is not just about what is going on in Egypt at the moment, but what may happen, and also about what is happening anywhere else on the route e.g if you have to make connection flights in another country. No one wants to over react to media information, but equally everyone should be taking note and assessing the situation and reacting as appropriately as possible with the information provided."
boringFS - Well said. Thanks for your response to luxorforyou.
"On a more bright side, all the samples tested in Luxor hotel and cruise ships (both tourists and workers) came out negative. However, I think they were random, not 100% of the people were tested. Not bad though."
Good news! Real data & info super helpful!
"""Would you be able to afford to lose £3500 if you weren't going to be refunded, I don't think so. I certainly can't.""Due to hubbo's compromised immune system we have decided to forego our planned 2 weeks in Marsa starting next week. It cost just under £2500 of which we will not see a penny. The tour operator will not defer nor the insurance pay out unless we have a doctor's letter stating he is 'unfit' to travel but we cannot get one because he's not actually ill, just more at risk. We have put health before wealth and have reconciled ourselves to the financial loss by reminding ourselves that as we had already paid all the money out we are no worse off than before - just deprived of a holiday. We will of course also not have to pay out for spendinis, the dog sitters and private airport transfers,We could afford to pay it so we can afford to lose it. Mind you I am very glad we weren't going somewhere more exotic and expensive! That would have been harder to swallow."
Wid - Sorry to hear you had to cancel - stupid virus! We are still not sure 9 days out from travel date ...
one after another report here in USA of people returning from Egypt as long as 2 weeks ago and are now testing positive for the covid 19 virus. Most were on cruise.
"We have decided to cancel our trip that was going to happen in 20 days after considering all the risks which concentrate around being between the crowds in the airport, fear of getting stuck and quarantined and what would happen to our babies if one of us parents gets the virus. We’re going down the list of what can cancel. Egyptair already announced that they will refund full amounts with no fees and ours already changed schedules 5 times which doesn’t work for our plan anymore so I called and cancelled yet I still had to submit a refund request online which will take 4 weeks to process. 1 of our 4 hotels was only refundable so that’s cancelled. 1 other one honored to waive the cancellation and refunded our payment. There is one more that Hotels.com is trying to get approval from but no response yet. I called delta Air France as our $5000 tickets are non refundable. They advises to wait till 7-5 days prior to the flight as there is a high likelihood It will get cancelled which means we get full refund. If not, they will give us a voucher with the money to be used in the next year toward other trips. If part of the money used e remaining balance will extend another year before expiring. So it’s not that bad after all. I plan on still insisting on money back when the time comes but for now it’s good to know what options u have for cancelling etc. we started with the hotels since those can be easily rebooked if we didn’t get our airfare refund, then the local flight then the international flight. We have lost our excitement and will not be going anywhere this spring break but already feel such a sense of relief knowing there is a second time, we’re still getting our money back (possible lose of $1500 is better than $7000 not including our expenses abroad and transportation $$ that we are still reserving) at least if we get a voucher we’re motivated to visit somewhere abroad again within the next year :) most importantly I know we won’t regret this decision no matter what the outcome because safety is dirt upon the uncertain circumstances that face the world now.Edited: 10:50 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"Sorry you have had to do thatThe situation is very fluid all over the world, not just Egypt, unfortunately, with no end in sight."
"gene, please don't lose sight of the fact that although there would seem to be a common factor - Nile Cruises - with people in the states getting the virus, there are other possible contributing and/or common factors too, not least the international air travel. It is very sad that so many people are infected, and likely yet to be, infected by this virus, but I think we have to be careful when attributing blame. If people have caught the virus on a cruise, then the question has to be asked - how did it get onto the cruise boat in the first place. It is impressive to see how many chains have been found when following victims of this virus, but I doubt all links can and will be found, and certainly not in all cases."
"zozekoke I'm sad for you that you will be missing your much planned for holiday, but it is completely understandable that you have decided to cancel it for now. It's good that so many of the travel companies are being as helpful and co-operative as they can be at the moment. It makes good business sense in the long run, but in the short term is going to cost them a lot. I hope that once this crisis is over, you can re-plan your trip and enjoy all that Egypt has to offer you."
"That's good that some travel agencies are working with clients. I booked my trip through Audley Travel and they are saying that I'm going to lose all $11,000 (excluding airfare) I paid to them for our trip unless I pay them another $1300 to reschedule. Does that seem reasonable to everyone?"
I have the same problem. starting 14th of March i have to be on semiramis cruise. Stop. I've already give it up. I am coming from Europe and i've seen enough here. it is not my dream to be for 14 day in a forced quarantine on a small boat. better take care on my family here at my home...sweet home.
"We finally broke down and are cancelling our trip supposed to start in a week. Amongst all the many other reasons, the biggest is we just can’t risk being sick or quarantined in a foreign country with our kids. Royal Jordanian Airline is allowing rescheduling within a year of issuance date without fees, but we unfortunately booked through Orbitz, and RJ says it could be a different policy. I have been on phone hold with Orbitz for hours. I have no idea how this will play out. I should have booked direct with the airline, but at this point, any advice?We were able to cancel a couple hotels we booked directly, but we also paid an Egyptian tour company 25% deposit for the rest of trip including cruise & domestic flights & tour guides. I’ve sent them an email, and am awaiting response.Any advice is helpful. Beyond that, wish me luck recouping or rebooking this very expensive vacation."
This is terrible. We will cancel our trip too since our pre trip to Israel has been cancelled and I hear the border is closed to Egypt into Jordan. I'm so disappointed since I booked this trip two years ago. Delta I believe is refunding us our money and Viking is giving us a voucher to use in the next two years with no penalty which is very generous. Best of luck to you all and I hope you can recoup some of your money.
"We were scheduled to arrive in Cairo on 3/7, then fly to Luxor on 3/9. Upon landing in Frankfurt, we learned of the Coronavirus outbreak while waiting for our connection. Our friends who were arriving on 3/9 & traveling with another company contacted us to tell us their trip was cancelled by the travel company due to the Coronavirus. We opted to abort out trip & return to the US. Since arriving home, the situation has worsened... we felt it wasn’t worth the risk to end up sick and/or quarantined in Egypt... the pyramids will still be there next year!"
"Shelly H - Agreed. And with US now restricting travel with most of Europe, who knows what other restrictions are to come. I don’t want to be caught overseas with my kids navigating this constantly changing situation in a country we don’t speak the language ..."
I've checked with my agent and no refunds will be given until the FCO deem it unsafe to travel to any country. As I have a package I can't change anything. My hols begin in August but I have to pay the four figured amount mid May. I wonder how this lot will pan out.
"crewmeal, as has been seen in the past, our FCO can be a bit slow in updating their 'no go' maps and advice.I have been in that situation in the past regarding travel to Egypt, and am in it now for other parts of the world for holidays I've booked and either already paid for in full or else paid a hefty deposit + flights. It can be very frustrating , but all we can do is to keep checking the information and hope that this wave of virus passes quickly and does not flow again."
"Yes Kara... we feel extremely lucky we got back before the US travel ban since we were connecting through Germany on 3/19. We are appealing to Uniworld for a future cruise credit, yet again. We are hoping they are willing to work with us in light of the escalating situation. We have no idea if the trip is actually taking place and if the itinerary has been altered at all. My husband is 77, in good health, but continuing on was just not a risk we felt we should take. We are so disappointed to be missing the trip, but plan to reschedule when world travel is safer, hopefully with Uniworld... if they offer to work with us. Sending good thoughts you are able to recoup costs as well. I think most travel companies are offering future credit. We also just cancelled a Mediterranean trip scheduled in May for a full credit, including excursions."
Don't do it. I have to go after 2 days and I ' ve alread give it up.take best decision for you.
"We're booked to fly to Cairo in 2 weeks for a trip that includes a few day Nile cruise, Abu Simbel, etc. all the high lights, plus a few days in London coming home. Not sure what to do, and there is no refund from the tour, hotels, etc. Maybe the airlines... So would loose a lot of money... We're in our early 60s, healthy, but still...."
"Susan - I would say wait and see ... 2 weeks is a long time. The decision may be made for you or the situation more clear. No use canceling non-refundable tours and flights now.Edited: 9:42 pm, March 12, 2020 "
crewmeal 2018 - Don't pay for future travel at this time! Prices for future travel will probably come way way way down. The industry is going to be desperate for travelers and make great offers to lure us back!
"I have since learned that much of my trip can be postponed/ not the nile cruise, which is fine, as not sure I ever want to get on a ship again, but it might be willing to negotiate when the time comes.... As for the rest there is a 10 percent fee to postpone but that is livable, so I'm feeling better. And I could wait another week as maybe they'll forgo even the 10 percent."
Don’t go. 41 Americans have been confirmed with coronavirus after they traveled to Egypt.
"Please reconsider. A trip of a lifetime is not worth your life and possibility of being in a country that does not have capacity should medical pandemic occur. 41 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the USA due to travel in Egypt, mostly cruises. Luxor is in semi lockdown. I have followed this closely for a week. Please don’t go"
https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/coronavir…Don’t go!!!! Trust me you will thank me.
"Remember that if you defer to a later set of dates, your travel insurance will deem it to be a new trip and will no longer cover any Coronavirus claims that you might want to make on it. No brainer to me - don't go."
"Don’t go! We just got my son out of there. 41 cases have been confirmed in the USA traced to Egypt travel. Many more in other countries. It is not safe. Flights are being cancelled. You risk quarantine there or when you return. I have followed this closely. Do your research, google and look at Twitter. https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/coronavir…"
"Bk, I think people got your post 1st time round tbh."
"and 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc.How to spread panic all by yourself!"
"Yes, that's what my tour co. told me re the hotels, guides, etc. in Egypt... Cost and refund about the same as yours,. It's better than what I was expecting which was nothing, So I was happy w/that... Problem is the cruise the tour operator said he has to negotiate, so I'm waiting to hear about that once I actually cancel..."
"#74There are 2499 cases of Coronavirus in the US at the moment, 41 from a Nile cruise. How many from other sources like the Princess cruises? From Europe, China etc? Community transfer?You better stay indoors, it's everywhere."
"Whilst the panic continues over the statistics of those who have tested positive, little is being said about how many of those cases make a fairly quick recovery. Worth a thought."

"Ship was the Asara, booked thru Gate1"
what is the problem with you? I am facing the same the same problem and it is supposed to be now together with my wife on a nile cruise. I've give it up an now I am watching tv programs at my home. here the authorities declared state of national emergencies but at least I am home together with my family. what about florida state ? my brother is leaving there and he told me that the situation is tragic. stay home man and I'll meet you in egypt next year. hope to take the best decision.
