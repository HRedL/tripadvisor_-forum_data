"Disney are now saying they will stay closed until first week of May, some say 2nd others say 5th but it seems pretty definite April is a washout. I think even May might be too optimistic, I reckon June at the earliest.Tokyo Disney are open but checking temp on entry, observing social distancing in all lines and restaurants and everyone has to wear a mask.Doesn’t sound like much fun to me, I would rather not go.How do you eat an ice cream in a mask?"
Might work for ice cream but what about a pretzel?

"They can't open when all of us are under a stay at home order until April 30. At least in Florida, that is not literal order, but theme parks are not an essential business per Orange County, and it specifically addresses that in the document."
"The mask crack me up. Don't people realize they do nothing except keep dust out? Nope! Gives a sense of false security, but if that gets things open, please wear them!"
Maybe June or July.Well I better get prepared for not having a summer holiday this year.
Did they say what May? I wonder how long it will be before British visitors return?Over 1 million visitors each year visit from the UK and many of them will suffer from economic dislocations that will impact on them for years to come. Sungod you might have the place to yourself for the next few years.
"The official WDW site still says closed until further notice. I’m sure it will be closed beyond even May 1, but I don’t see that officially posted on their site."
"Universal have done an operations update, Im sure the rest will follow suit.....https:/…operations-updateWe know Coronavirus (COVID-19) has impacted many parts of your life – including your travel and vacation plans and we will be eager to welcome you back to our theme parks and destination when the time comes. For now, we must make the health and safety of our guests and team members our top priority and we will continue to take guidance from health agencies and government officials.This means we are extending the closure of Universal Orlando Resort at least through May 31. This includes our theme parks and Universal CityWalk. The Universal Orlando Resort hotels have also temporarily suspended operations through this time period."
">> The mask crack me up. Don't people realize they do nothing except keep dust out? <<Just got back from a Publix run and was trying not to laugh out loud at some of the ""masks"". Saw a couple people with bandana tied over their nose and mouth, like they were Jesse James robbing a train. They couldn't possibly be doing anything, other than hiding their identity."
"The CDC is recommending people wear facemasks in places were social distancing is usually not possible (grocery stores, drug stores). Many cities in South Florida including the City of Miami have made it a requirement. More recent data has now confirmed that airborne transmission of COVID is just as likely as transmission via surfaces. But hey, people on TA say it's not necessary so it must be so."
"Exactly, rktj. “CDC continues to study the spread and effects of the novel coronavirus across the United States. We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (“asymptomatic”) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (“pre-symptomatic”) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms. This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing—even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms. In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.It is critical to emphasize that maintaining 6-feet social distancing remains important to slowing the spread of the virus. CDC is additionally advising the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure.The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.”https:/…cloth-face-cover.htmlMasks protect others more so than the wearer. I’m willing to do my part and cover up even if it only helps a bit. It takes very little effort and could help someone else."
Tokyo Disneyland is closed.
Thanks Danny I applaud Universal for closing til May 31 at least.
"We have some contributors who seem to feel that their own testosterone overload is protecting them from the virus and that protecting others from THEIR snot is not a priority (Post 9, 16, etc maga maga) Ok, mask specialists … even if you wear your wife's monthly pad superglued to your manly mustache - it will still catch the droplets from your cough or sneezes. This is not to protect YOU. Its for others around you - and they have a right to be protected and they are doing their part to protect you by wearing a mask. Sadly, Instead of gratitude , they get mocked by the peanut gallery That's all :)Edited: 8:21 pm, April 09, 2020 "
"Masks work to an extent. It's common sense that anything would have more trouble bypassing a barrier than getting in with no barrier. It might not be 100% effective, but it beats nothing.."
"Wow, no one has ever implied I was macho before, I'm touched spammie.Here's the problem with masks,Proper (and properly worn) masks do help in preventing the spread of airborne particles from someone who is sick. However, the vaaaaast majority of people wearing ill-fitting, homemade masks are not sick, so they are not wearing them for some higher-social goal.Anyone who is sick should not be going to the store and spinning the roulette wheel, hoping they don't infect someone - STAY THE F HOME, if you are sick.What they do, is lure people into a false sense of security and they tend to ignore more important hygiene. - ""hey I'm wearing a torn up t-shirt over my mouth and nose, that I am constantly fiddling with and touching my face to adjust it -- that nanoscopic virus will never get me!"" or ""we're all wearing masks, so we can ignore social distancing guidelines""How many people wearing those homemade masks are using even a basic decontamination protocol? I constantly see people whip them out of their pocket and put them on or pull them off outside and stuff them back in their pocket. No concern that any virus that may be on the mask transferred to their hands or anything - nahh, that can't happen, my t-shirt magically kills the virus."
"""I applaud Universal for closing til May 31 at least.""https:/…"
"Haaa, Seriously some of you must walk around in a protective bubble. I wonder if the CDC said that clothing trapped the virus so we should all walk around naked if you actually would. Let's put things into reality. It isn't the droplets that are the problem. You are severely misinformed or missed out in elementary biology if you do not understand the size of a virus. Thinking a piece of cloth provides any protection is like thinking that standing behind a chain link fence will stop you from getting wet from someone with a hose on the other side. You are doing nothing more than giving yourself a false sense of security. I heard that if you wear aluminum foil on your head that it will protect you as well.I saw a comedian put it best when he pointed out that if covering your face did anything at all then we should never smell flatulence. We know that isn't the case so why in the world do you think your dust mask provides any form of protection at all? Let's put this into a different perspective. Let's put this into a different perspective. You are the size of a virus particle. The empire state building is the size of a dust particle. Do you think you would have any problem passing through a net designed to trap the building? Science is fascinating.I expect Florida to be open in May. I don't see why it wouldn't. The numbers don't support the fear. Hospitals are running at less than 40% capacity. The numbers are not substantially out of line with what is normal attrition and in line with a typical flu season and we don't shutdown the state for that.Edited: 8:28 am, April 10, 2020 "
I must ask why you think Florida will be open in May when Universal has already announced they will be closed thru at least May 31? So not open in May.
Even if the parks do open in May how many visitors will they have?
"Why? because the sky isn't falling. That is why. The catastrophe has been way over blown and you can't fool the people forever. There is no chance we go more than 3 weeks shaking with fear let alone 2 months. The biggest motivator are these unemployment claims. People need to get back to work. The big indicator that thing will be opening is that the governor hasn't closed schools for the year. If schools open, people will go back to work. It won't be like a light switch opening things. I'm sure it will ramp, but I would be completely shocked if we hit June and the parks are still closed."
Prepare to be shocked then. Florida’s governor is in denial like others and his actions have been harmful.
Denial? Show me the facts that show otherwise because what I'm seeing doesn't support the nonsense. Decisions are based on facts not fear. Harmful actions would be to ruin people's lives unnecessarily. We are not idiots. We are not going to put ourselves at risk unnecessarily. You are free to wear your hazmat suit inside your hermetically sealed house until it gets foreclosed or you pass from starvation because you have no money to survive on. Meanwhile the rest of us would like to get on with out lives.
"Sunngod the word “catastrophe and the statement “over blown” are an oxymoron, if it’s a catastrophe ( your words) it cant be overblown. What is in oxymoron and also in SunngodI await my suspension and will wear it with as a badge of honour."
"Fluffy, I'm guessing you missed the sarcasm. There is no catastrophe here in Fla."
"There is a really good interview on YouTube with Dr Fauci and the editor of the JAMA. One of the most informative and intelligent interviews I’ve seen about the virus ,they discuss how we might start releasing some of the quarantine restrictions and what we need to see before we do."

"This thread demonstrates the old saying that you shouldn't argue with a fool :) Science is indeed fascinating. I never before realized how open it is to being twisted in roundabout 4D pretzels :D As for the sky not falling … There are currently nearly 17000 Americans and their families who feel that the sky fell smack on their heads. Funny, how perspective change one's point of view. So, lets leave aside all the fake logic and assume the mask does nothing to protect YOU. One more time … read this slowly … The mask is worn for those around us - and in return, those around us respect us enough and care enough to wear a mask to keep us safe. Everyone keeps their droplets stuck in their own fabric . No, it's not 100%. There will be a certain virus load that ends up in a suspended mist and many of those particles are indeed small enough to slip through fabric quite easily. But droplets that carry most of the virus in a ball of body fluid … most of that stays nicely contained in the sneezers/coughers fabric mask.Petulantly not wearing a mask because we are too ""murican"" for that just demonstrates that we couldn't care less about others who might want to enjoy the same surroundings and who we make nervous. It's 2020 ""rude"".Edited: 11:34 am, April 10, 2020 "
"Spammie, I'm glad you are an expert. Maybe you can explain why 90% of Chinese were wearing mask and the disease still spread? False hope. As for your 17,000 number. How many people die in the US ever day? on average that is about 7500. Every day. No epidemic, no pandemic, just every day. So going back a month we would have typically seen 200k or so that died. So you want to attribute 17K of that to this virus? Well that number happens to be in the norm for what we would see of people dying from respiratory issues. That is not to say that every person that they are counting has died of the virus. They are counting anyone that passes that tests positive as a victim. See how your numbers are not so scary anymore? Undoubtedly there are areas that are impacted more than others. Viruses have their sweet spot as does most living organisms (hmmm are viruses living or non living?) and strain seems to thrive in cooler climates. Which is why you see places like NY, Wuhan, Northern Italy, South Korea, etc. as hot spots while places that a communicable disease could ravage a population like Rio, Mumbai, etc. are not so bad. Now as for the masks, droplets are not the problem. the virus is much much smaller than a droplet of water vapor. Here is a real world test just to show how far off you are with this mask nonsense. Grab a cigarette and take a drag. Put your mask over your face and blow out. Does your mask have any effect whatsoever on that smoke? Nope. It passes straight through. That smoke is about 5 times the size of a virus particle. Wearing a mask because it gives you false hope just demonstrates that we are sheep who need false hope."
Thank you Spammie.
"Did we really just equate smoke with liquid .. and do we really keep arguing that size matters when the virus is happiest suspended in a medium.. a liquid medium - so therefore , the size of the droplet counts, not the size of a single virus specimen? We are not living in the same universe. It takes a Chinese made hat to achieve that level of enlightenment . I sincerely hope that none of your family, friends and neighbors dies - like a previously very healthy 41 year old colleague of mine, A father and husband who caught it on duty.  I hope that the families of those dead that you are explaining away as insignificent can forgive you. As for me .. I am following my own advice of not arguing with a .. Peace out.Edited: 3:43 pm, April 13, 2020 "
Well said Spammie.
"Keep wearing your mask Spam. It will protect you! Keep living in your fantasy world where science and math don't apply. I'm sorry, but death is a reality for life. You can choose to get all worked up because you watch the news or your can choose reality.I'm willing to bet that your 41 year old friend had some underlying conditions. This virus isn't ebola. 93% of those that died in Italy were over 60. 40% of those in the US are minorities. Why? because they have the highest rates of hypertension and obesity.Here is another statistic for you. The 3rd leading cause of death in the US is respiratory failure. 3rd! Now if you have ever lost a loved one you know that it is rarely a single incident that ends their life. Of course except for car accident, gun shot, etc. Usually someone with cancer will eventually suffer from heart failure or pneumonia or something. They will pick something as the cause, but no one is going to get corona and just die. It just doesn't happen like that. Again, this isn't ebola. Just to help you with the science, viruses do not need to be attached to something to travel. They are individual particles that are free to move as they choose. Could they suspend in water, sure why not, but do they need to? No. I don't know how hard it is for you to grasp reality. I can prove that your mask doesn't work. You can't prove that it does. Still want to argue with science? In the scientific world you have theories and you have proofs. You can theorize that a mask might work, but I can prove that it doesn't. Where do you want to put your money? Maybe the CDC can start paying your unemployment? You can argue with me because you don't like me. I really don't care, but you can't argue with the science or the math. They simply do not support your position. I'm sorry. You may want to turn off the Today show and pick up a text book."
Just had an expert on tv here in the UK.He said that a mask should be worn if you are infected as it helps stop infecting others. You of course should not be outdoors if you are infected anyway but if you live with your family it will help protect them.If you are not infected a mask can do more harm than good and is not recommended.The issue is you have to keep touching it to take it on and off so if you have touched a surface with the virus and then touch the mask it goes straight into your mouth. The expert also said it gives a false sense of security. It’s been found that mask wearers think they are safe so do not wash their hands every time they touch the mask and infect themselves that way. The Chinese have always used masks due to pollution so it’s not surprising they wear them for coronavirus but as far as UK experts are concerned they will not help you much and are not needed.
"You can't actually prove that ""a mask doesn't work.""That simply is not true. You can argue about the efficacy, but that's another matter."
"#43- that was the same logic they used back in March here in the US and it makes sense. But, as I posted up thread, they revised the recommendation. All of the reasons you give to not wear one aren’t that they don’t work it’s just that they don’t help if people don’t use commons sense. You still need to social distance, you still shouldn’t touch your face, you should still wash your hands frequently. Seems like a mask plus common sense precautions is the best mix. If people lack the basic common sense on using them then, yeah, probably no point to wearing one."
"Sunngod : ""Keep living in your fantasy world where science and math don't apply. I'm sorry, but death is a reality for life. You can choose to get all worked up because you watch the news or your can choose reality."" In my not so fantasy world, I am in emergency medicine … just saying."
Can we get back to Tokyo Disney? Marilyn and mick where did you read it’s open? Their website says they are still closed.

To be honest I have been checking on so many Disney sites for news I can’t remember which one said Tokyo had reopened. However I think what happened was they were going to open mid April but still maintain social distancing and make everyone wear a mask (except when eating ice cream Mike) but then Japan had a huge increase in infections so they cancelled the reopening and It is still closed. So the wait goes on.
"Jon, I can prove it doesn't work. That is pretty simple and even a 5th grade science class can prove that. You have to breathe. The only mask that would work would be one that blocked air completely, but you would die. Unless you can provide a separate oxygen tank or like an OBA that we used in the Navy, you have to have air flow. Even the coveted n95 standard mask only blocks 95% of particulates, but guess what size particulates can easily pass through? You guessed it, virus particulates because they are so small. Want me to continue or are you satisfied enough that there is proof that they are not making us safe? Can they slow them down? Sure just like putting a chain link fence in front of a fire hose."
"High Five, octoberitaly2"
"I would love for sunngod to visit Elmhurst hospital, or any of the hospitals in New York City and Long Island and then come back to this forum and report to all of us if what is going on there looks like just a normal amount of respiratory deaths that happen every day in the US.And, maybe while you’re at it, you could give all the medical workers in those hospitals your speech about how they shouldn’t bother wearing those masks or any other PPE because they do nothing other than provide a false sense of security."
"Moh,Fact - What is going on in NY isn't going in 99% of the rest of the US. Maybe you don't realize this, but there is a county in Florida with no reported cases and many in the single digits. Makes zero sense to lock those down.Fact- NY is only using 19%, yes 19% of it's hospital bed capacity.Fact - While masks are not effective against blocking viruses, they do offer protections. Remember there are a lot more health concerns beyond COVID. Keep wearing your mask. You can't hide forever."
"I don’t know the exact percentages, however New York is a very big state, and yes, they may only be using a fraction of the available beds in the state, but rest assured, the percentage of beds being used in the City and Long Island is nearly 100%, I’m sure. Also, it’s not the beds that are the issue, it’s the respirators/ventilators that are the issue here and the lack of personal protective gear for hospital workers.My dad was in the hospital last week for surgery unrelated to this virus and one of his nurses told me they are allowed one mask each per 12 hour shift. Many are very concerned, and these are not the large N95 masks we’re talking about, they are very thin looking masks, but they’re still wearing them so they obviously feel they are being protected to some extent.Also, I’d bet that the county you refer to in Florida as having no cases at all, is because they’ve done little to no testing within that county."
Mohmamom you said it. We get one flimsy mask a day. I am used to wearing it in the operating room so I don’t touch and adjust but many do. And n95 we have to beg for despite people coughing all over me due to my line of work.And again you are absolutely correct about the distribution of beds and vents. One cannot look at NY as a state and get a clear picture of what’s going on inNYC. Best to you Mohmamom
"And to you, as well, October. Stay safe!"
"Roughly 110.5M americans (18-64) have never been tested for HIV and these tests are readily available. Even if there were enough tests for covid for everyone, I have doubt people would even go."
Covid tests have high rates of false negative. And then after the test people can be exposed at grocery or work or whatever. So it’s not like a one time test is adequate. Multiple testings will be needed. And currently still hard to get a test.
"Beginning Monday, those in Osceola County will be required to wear some sort of face covering when out in public.https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2020…"
How does NYC have soo many cases?
"The UPenn Chime model, being used by medical centers, is predicting that some counties in Florida are not close to peak and that the peak for some areas with current lower numbers will peak in June. Miami and Orlando are ahead of the curve. I can’t imagine the state easing social distancing or opening tourist attractions until the entire state is much closer to a total flattening. As far as PPE shortages go I can attest that I am employed by the largest provider in Florida and there is most certainly a shortage in just about everything. A very large medical center has about 500/600 beds- many hospitals have around 300. Hospitals beds are comprised by units of 20 to 30 beds to each unit. You will not have a mix of populations on units (no medicine patients on the labor and delivery unit, no adults on a pediatric unit, psych units are for people experiencing a psychiatric emergency). Therefore, only a portion of beds in a hospital can be used for Covid patients. Mentioned to bring clarity."
"“How does NYC have soo many cases?”Scrolled by a story yesterday that the theory is many European tourists. But, you’ll have to see if you can validate that. I was on a legitimate site but I don’t remember where I saw that particular story or how well researched it was."
Disney reaches some sort of agreement with their union workers. Announcement coming at noon Orlando time.
"What an awful post is #64. So I heard from someone, who read on somewhere that it was Europeans who caused the disaster in NY but I’m not sure. Wow. Maybe it was the “ it will all be over by Easter” attitude, just like the Great War we have a situation of the Lions being led by Donkeys. This is a global pandemic, yes it starts somewhere but when you have globalisation to the extent we have, the movement of people will always move diseases around the world. A world solution is required and returning to 1920s isolationism will not prepare us for the new world that awaits us at the other end."
"Re #64 I don’t read this as malicious at all nYTimes published an article reviewing a journal article in peer submission. Genetic studies show that most of the East Coast cases came from a virus from Europe, while West Coast from China. Nothing malicious, just looking at small mutations and rna evidence to see where spread cake fromhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com…"

Maybe it that different cultural thing??Think I agree with post #69 ..Edited: 2:35 pm, April 11, 2020 "
"Re post 64- I think the poster is just commenting on something she read. I read it too and it makes sense to me. I’m European ( I think- from U.K.!) and I’m not offended, Can’t be offended by facts. It’s a worldwide epidemic, everybody had to get it from somewhere.Maybe I am tone deaf!"
"I don't think Beth meant any malice in her response, but I don't think you could attribute NYC being the hotspot because of European travel. Orlando is on par with any city in the US as being a place frequented by international visitor, and compounded worse by the fact they all flock to essentially 3 parks and are packed in for hours on end. If there were a place that could have been an epicenter, it should have been there, but there is a big difference between NYC and Orlando. That is weather. You see a connection between places that were hard hit and that is climates that are similar. I know people throw New Orleans into it and try to claim that not to be true, but New Orleans in particular was very cool during Mardi Gras which is when they seem to have been impacted the most. Some places are just better incubators for this virus. That is why it doesn't make a lot of sense to punish the entire country for what is mostly an incident that is isolated to one part. I'm pretty sure that if NYC wasn't impacted, but instead Omaha Nebraska, we wouldn't see the panic."
