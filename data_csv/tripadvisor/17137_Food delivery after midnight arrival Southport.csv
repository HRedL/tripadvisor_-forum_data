Hi I arrive tonight staying at Southport. My flight to Brisbane arrives after 10—11pm so I won't get to my motel in Southport until midnight. I always get hungry after midnight so I wanna ask Are there any late night delivery fastfood restaurants that can deliver to my motel in Southport? Many thanks.
"you would have to check food delivery apps like uber eats etc...most mcdonalds in big areas are open 24/7 now, you might find a late night kebab shop open as it is a touristy area... but for a proper meal i doubt anything will open that late as a side note - your profile says your from the gold coast - why are you staying in a motel?"
"I used to live near Tuhan but I don't know Southport at night. I'm flying from Asia to Brisbane Airport staying around Southport. After 6pm everything closed there in Southport usually. really sucks after coming FROM Asia where 24 hours you can get food almost anywhere. Ya I know Uber Eats has an app but I am not aware does the app say these are the restaurants open after 12am? I don't wanna walk around Southport at 12am..have you been around there? even during the day so many drug addicts and people coming up to u asking for money, guys sleeping in streets I seen myself near the 'new' China town there.so that's why I want delivery... I'D hate to arrive 12am and then the motel no food and all restaurants no delivery no food. it's like going back in time there at night. Everything closes so early.. even the shops on Saturday night Sunday close so early.. kind of ridiculous compared TO Asia. I can't understand why so many drug addicts there and homeless people there now too. before 10yrs ago wasn't as bad."
"Deliveroo, Menulog, Uber Eats, etc.Hardly anyone in Australia cooks or eats out any more. And we wonder why there is an obesity epidemic."
Sort of wondering why you are going to Southport when you seem to think it's a dump.
Ok so seems nobody knows for which restaurants are open and do delivery then?
"I rather like living in a country that doesn’t have all its shops open 24 hours a day, thanks.You say you’re flying into Brisbane airport. Why not buy something to eat there when you arrive?There may be places in Surfers open at midnight - why not google that & see? You could probably get delivery from there to Southport.I imagine the reason none of us knows which restaurants are open and have delivery services after midnight, is that we don’t have a requirement for it."
"I am not asking if anyone has a requirement for it or if u eat at home or not. I am asking if anyone knows for sure. Or if anyone is local from Southport that does order food or knows for sure. So obviously no one has more info than I did in beginning, just Google or Uber eats."
"yep, just google or Uber Eats (what more do you need)"
Why not ask your motel?
"When you do find out, post on here so we can all know & pass it on to someone else who needs the info."
By the way ... I simply googled uber eats in Southport and they operate 24/7 so I'll take a wild guess and say there is also food available 24/7 through them.
