"Hi all, Since last year, I have been planning to move to Australia with my three kids (9, 8 and 5 yo) by June 2020. I have been planning to travel via emirates. Now due to this recent virus pandemic, should I delay the travel further or by June the situation would be better? My husband is already in Australia and I will be travelling solo with three kids that's why I am a bit anxious. Your kind comments are deeply appreciated."
I am in Lahore Pakistan atm.
I sincerely hope that things will settle down in three months time but it has moved beyond individual decision making and onto national as well as global scale. If the borders are open and planes are flying close to normal schedule then of course you can come but we can't even tell what changes tomorrow brings at the moment.
Yes he has accommodation there. So 14 day quarantine will still be in place by the end of June? I guess it depends on the situation at the time.I am just keeping my fingers cross that situation will get better soon. Emirates has a stopover at Dubai and sometimes at Bangkok too.Thanks Luigi A for your fast reply.
"June ...well nobody in the world knows.My understanding is that if you come via BKK ,then it will be Qantas to Australia . Qantas have cut 90 %of their International Flights I would sit tightGood Luck"
"As mentioned there is no end date for the quarantine requirement. Our politicians in TV interviews have been talking about the next 6 months. That is not a prediction, but I think it is more a reflection of their current planning. But that 6 month figure is really only an educated guess at best.I think you should make sure you have somewhere to stay for your first 2 weeks at least. Then start planning your trip."
Thanks everyone for your replies. Really appreciated:))
