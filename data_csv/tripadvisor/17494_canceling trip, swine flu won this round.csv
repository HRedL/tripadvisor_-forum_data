"Hello, my husband and i have arranged a one month trip, starting on 1st of may, visiting paris, venice, greece and thailand. we are so dissappointed since we have canceled everything due to this problem. we think everyone is likely to contract the desease in airports and airplains, no matter where you are. You dont know who might have it!i suffer from atsma, so if i catch it, this can be a very bad situaion for me.First bangkok political problem happens, now this.what do you think? are we making it bigger than it really is? Thank you. "
It's too late now. You've made a difficult decision in difficult circumstances. I hope you will be able to rearrange in due course.
"It's obviously a personal choice.I would not be canceling any trips (unless I was heading to certain parts of Mexico again).It seems every time a few people get hit with a new strain of virus the big ""pandemic"" word gets bandied around and the press make a mountain out of the situation.I suppose eventually one of these diseases will become a genuine international issue but until then I figure that I have just as much chance of contracting it at home as I do abroad.In a way it's media terrorism!"
"While I appreciate your dilema, what about the person next to you at the supermarket, or on the bus, or standing next to you at taffic lights? You can't wrap yourself in cotton wool and not move around doing your day to day chores. You have as much chance of getting it overseas as getting it at home."
"If you have concerns over your safety or feel uncomfortable in any way, then it will affect your trip as it will always be in the back of your mind.With the disease in Airports, as advised on television and other media the key is to keep contact with other persons and objects used by the general public to a minimum and follow common sense hygiene rules - For example:If you're going to use the bathrooms, always make sure that you wash your hands afterwards and when you exit, use a paper towel to open the door to exit and discard it in a bin once out.Carry around a small bottle of waterless hand sanitizer. This means that if you need to eat in the airport you can put some on your hands to kill any bacteria.If someone is sneezing and it's more like the flu or a cold, move away from where they are seated.In areas with potential infection carry masks.When dining out and you're not sure how clean the cutlery or dishes are, ask for a bowl of hot water and dip the cutlery and plates in the water. Carry some paper tissues to help clean the cutlery and dishes if you are particularly worried.Most places in Asia do not have tap water at drinking quality - always ensure you purchase bottled water or carry your own.On the plane, I carry a humidiflyer - this unit rehumidifies the air and is great for asthmatic sufferers. visit www.humidiflyer.com It also filters out bacteria reducing the potential to catch someone else's cold.The issue to consider for your next trip is that the potential to catch a flu or any other infection will still exist in your own town to a certain extent as when you go out you don't know where people have been. Unless an area is considered to be pandemic or rife with an outbreak you are generally ok. It's always a case of weighing up the risks and benefits.Hope you can get to Bangkok soon!"
<<what do you think? are we making it bigger than it really is? >>I think you are...It is still pretty much contained to Mexico and southern USA and I would go as far to say that more people have probably died on the roads in the past week than what have from this flu.In the end it is up to you but just remember that it is the medias job to make things sound worse than what they really are.
"Whilst I understand your concerns, so far as has been reported here it has only passed human to human where there has been very close contact, this being the case popping on a mask and good hygene should keep you fairly safe. Staying at home you run the same risks every time you use a train or bus or work with other people go to a restaurant cinemar theatre sporting event. Seems to me you have as much chance of catching it not travelling so personally I would travel and at least die happy!"
isnt it really contained mostly in mexico and sm parts of us???oh and as far as the bkk political situation goes been thru it twice sm how things just return to normal without much harm to tourists...(well my experience so far)
Hi;Swine flu virus are only spreading mainly in Mexico city now and everybody ia waiting for a Breakout pandemic at anytime. Bangkok is Not in the danger zone of this new Flu . No case is known in SE.Asia .Japan is already taking pre caution screening travelers at the Airports 
If we start cancelling everything we might as well live like the boy in the bubble.
"i think you have made a choice that suits you, IMO thailand would not be your choice desitation , now or ever because you worry to much. i had a chest infection yesterday i put it down to high pollon not swine fever.my opinion is nothing will suit you, unless it comes in a clinical 100 percent guarantee bubble and thailand isnt for those."
"Asia suspected swine flu cases risegoogle.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g-UX…Swine Flu Spreads to Countries in Asia-Pacific Region www.bloomberg.com/apps/news…Swine flu: Mexico claims it started in Asia telegraph.co.uk/health/swine-flu/5244801/Swi…Definitely in Asia, so I think it would be irresponsible to say otherwise. However that being said I would not cancel my holidays based on what is going on at this time. (over reaction comes to mind)"
"For some perspective here, anyone who has traveled anywhere in the past week and now has a runny nose or fever is ""suspected"" of swine flu until tested otherwise. In Australia they are saying there is 130+ ""suspected"" cases however I would be very surprised if any at all turn out to be positive. I would not personally be cancelling travel at this point in time unless of course I was going to Mexico!Adrian"
"I received this email today, as we are going to Thailand from May 2-16.April 30, 2009This warden message alerts U.S. citizens to the latest informationregarding human cases of H1N1 Influenza A (""swine flu""). As of April29, the World Health Organization has not reported any cases of H1N1Ainfluenza in Thailand. The Thai government has advised the public toavoid travel to Mexico and certain parts of the U.S. The Thaigovernment is also using thermal scanners to monitor passengers arrivingat international airports throughout Thailand.For further information about H1N1 influenza, including steps you cantake to stay healthy, please consult the following:* Department of State information at…state.gov/travel/…pa_pandemic.html* United States Centers for Disease Control website athttp://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/* World Health Organization website atwho.int/csr/disease/swineflu/en/index.html* Thai Department of Disease Control, Bureau of EmergingInfectious Diseases website at http://beid.ddc.moph.go.th/eng/"
"I suppose alot of people's views would be coloured by past experiences. If you have been one of those affected in any way by SARS, you'd probably think twice about travelling at this time. Especially since experts are saying that swine flu may be more contagious and those who have it may not have symptoms in the early stages. So thermal scanners, etc are limited in effectiveness. Even though there may be no cases in SE Asia at present, there are people passing through the airports of these countries who are from affected countries. Just somethings to bear in mind when making your decision about whether to travel."
"""<<what do you think? are we making it bigger than it really is? >>I think you are...It is still pretty much contained to Mexico and southern USA and I would go as far to say that more people have probably died on the roads in the past week than what have from this flu.""I can't believe this comment. It was only due to the diligence of authorities that Bird Flu and SARS have not yet turned into a Pandemic. This comment is beyond belief."
"<<I can't believe this comment. It was only due to the diligence of authorities that Bird Flu and SARS have not yet turned into a Pandemic. This comment is beyond belief.>>****sigh****** I was putting it into perspective - in case it hadn't occured to you - but feel free to believe everything the ""authorities"" and the media tell you. "
"Confirmed cases in the following countries. - Canada , USA , Mexico , UK , Spain , Germany , Austria , Israel , New Zealand  So Far 8 deaths worldwide as reported by the BBC.  Given that you have asthma , it's probably best you stay at home , but that won't mean you can't catch it , it's already on the move.   If anyone thinks dilligenece is airport thermal scanners , thats bull , i remember the SARS panic , i went through the cambodian border and was asked ""do i feel hot?"" Hell yes !! it's 95 degrees !  i'm in vietnam right now and arrive in thailand in 2 days time , i'm not worried at all. "
"'everyone is likely to contact the disease in airports and airplanes'.It's this sort of uninformed nonsense that scares people. Yes you could be infected on a plane - or on your local metro or by pressing a button in the elevator at your office. If you're on a plane with an infected person, it does not mean the whole plane will catch it. You've clearly been watching too many movies."
"A WHO spokesperson on the radio this morning put this into perspective for me. She said that a disease can be classed as a pandemic even though it kills fewer people than ordinary seasonal flu does.Yes, you could catch it on a plane, but you can catch TB too (and people have)."
"Personally i do think you have over reacted. I wouldnt of cancelled my trip, the media hipe makes it worse. Im not saying it isnt a problem as it clearly is, people have died from it. But i really wouldnt of gone to the extreme of cancelling my holiday."
We booked our flights to thailand yesterday - certainly not putting us off and we fly end of may.According to skynews - anywhere from 250'000-500000 folks die of normal flu worldwide every year.we cant wait..
"Hi;The SE.Asia Is Not in the affect Swine flu zone .The only dangerous Zone is North America with more severe cases in Mexico city the center of Pandemic , WHO raised the level 5 alert.Go ahead and travel to Bangkok if you already have plan in hand . People can catch any kind of Flu at any time without notice . "
"trat,In order to reassure people you MUST get your facts absolutely right. Whilst Mexico may be the centre the biggest concern is that this virus carries. That's why it has been upgraded to Level 5, the level next to a pandemic."
English is Trat's 2nd language. Words and thoughts don't always come in the right order. No doubt he means well.

"Perhaps we would all be better referring to the Sticky that TA has posted ""Swine Flu Travel Advisory"" with this this link http://www.tripadvisor.com/TravelAdvisory as ""It contains links to the official agencies and organizations equipped to handle this issue and provide you with ACCURATE information."" :)"
"Personally I would not have canceled. But, each person has to decide for himself or herself. I traveled, in S.E. Asia, straight through the years of SARS and Bird Flu and came out fine. I'm usually in Bangkok twice a year on vacation and also in other parts of the world. I did cancel the Bangkok trip, in December 2008, due to the political situation. I personally didn't have time to possibly get stuck in there if the airport was to remain closed. So, I went to another continent on vacation. But, I was there the Dec/Jan of the bombs in Bangkok. Who would have known that bombs would go off? I stayed and didn't leave until it was time for me to fly home. So, I kind of look at things as one never knows what's going to happen. Happy Travels!As for asthma, I know how that can be as I grew up with it and very badly until I was a teenager."
"How many people die of the normal flu a year?Hundreds of thousands die of that every year and so is really an epidemic.. Another one, if you find that someone has died of food poisoning in France, do you cancel your trip to Paris? The OP has thousands more chance of succumbing to an asthma attack than picking up some pig fever."
PLEASE - wearing a mask is a JOKE!!! it will have no effect after about 3 minutes and in fact could increase tyour chance of infection.sorry to hear you've got swine flu.We're all OK here in THaialnd......so far.....
"I think some people are missing the point about this particulat virus. It is a NEW previously UNKNOWN strain which is not yet built into our immune system. Yes, it may not prove fatal on a widespread basis but that is unknown at the moment. Yes, you may just suffer a heavy cold symptoms but that too is unknown. The fact that only a relative few die of other flu viruses every year is because there is inbuilt immunity and successful vaccination programmes. The fact that it is transmitted by air and the potential to infect others may spread exponentially i.e. I give it to you, you give it three others, they each give it 5 others etc. is how a pandemic starts.Dismiss the media hype, sure; don't panic, sure; but don't minimise the POTENTIAL risk of this virus, surely!"
Some people might benefit from looking up PandemicEpidemic&Endemicfor a start!Wearing of masks in a cultural thing in thailand - they do it at the drop of a hat - IT HAS VIRTUALLY NO EFFECT!
Well currently I have 2 neighbours and 1 sister on holiday in Spain which has cases of swine flu. I will be talking to my sister when she arrives back in the UK or my life won't be worth living and I will also be in close contact with the neighbours. Too much hype here. 
"Just read this on MSN today.....""Mexico lowers swine flu death toll""news.uk.msn.com/world/article.aspx…interesting......"
Take care. Have a safety.
"Daisy,Bit of a strange post - there are as many cases in the UK as in Spain, 13 in both countries, and 2 of ours have been in people who have caught it in the UK.One of the UK cases is nin my home town but noone is panicking. As far as WHO are concerned only 13 deaths have so far been confirmed as being caused by this virus"
Yes I should have referred to the UK too. Just couldn't understand why anybody would cancel a multi trip holiday. Personally think it's all over exagerated.
"You know you are far more likely to catch Swine flu in your home country than you are in Thailand (where there are zero cases, so far).So logically you should immediately quit your country."
"Yes, logically let's all leave our own countries and come and infect Thailand. Not a very constructive or logical post!"
