"It seems Egypt has its first encounter with Corona.""Egypt announces first Coronavirus infectionBy: Egypt Today staff Fri, Feb. 14, 2020 CAIRO – 14 February 2020: Egypt’s Health Ministry announced, Friday first Coronavirus infection for a ‘Chinese’ national in Egypt."""
I'm here my old bean. Nothing to worry about.
"Did see the Tiddlies at LGW all masked up, but only them, nobody else"
"Maybe the bloke arrested at Hurghada airport (for patting the security guard on ...hmmm... the back) is going to be declared infected with coronavirus, so the whole incident becomes a misunderstood quarantine? I'm joking of course but that would be quite a stunt ."
"It's quite ironic for me. I HAVE to travel wearing a mask and gloves as I had a stem cell transplant recently. I flew a couple of weeks ago and got mocked by three young 'gentlemen' on my flight, calling me Dick Turpin'. The laugh's on them now because I won't probably look out of place on my upcoming flights to and from Egypt!!!"
How very rude and unpleasant of them. If it weren’t bad karma I would wish they caught something nasty themselves.
