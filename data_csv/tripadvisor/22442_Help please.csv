Are Australians allowed in at the moment with this coronavirus?
"You are allowed to enter NZ, but you must self-isolate yourselves for 14 days. The only exemptions are people who have visited or who live in the Pacific Islands. Australia has corona virus and is therefore not a Pacific Island nationhttps:/…"
As I understand it the newly announced self-isolation measures will be reviewed in 16 days.We are due to travel in June and are playing a “wait and see” game at the moment. If the measures remain we will cancel as 14 days is longer than our trip.
"Yes, you're allowed - but as of midnight Sunday (15th March) you must self-isolate for 14days."
Thank you
"Goldiegirl, same here. We are only going for 12 days. I seriously hope it changes. Hope you can still go"
Just on the news yes but have to self isolate for 14 days if arriving after this Sunday
Yes you are allowed in. But you will be in isolation for 2 weeks... not kidding!
Can anyone provide details on what this 2 week “self isolation” looks like? What are the rules around it and how will it be regulated? Many thanks.
"Kia ora,#8 isolation is what it means (you are allowed to take a walk around the block from your hotel whilst keeping your distance, but you should not take public transport/taxi or go to restaurants etc) if you are asking the question then you are inferring that you are considering ignoring or trying to get around it. Do not do that. The measures have been put in place for everyone's benefit - to limit the spread of the virus. I would advise cancelling any forthcoming travel to NZ.Edited: 6:19 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"Marek, please do not assume that you know why I am asking. I am a Canadian residing in Canada. I have no plans, nor did I have plans, to travel to New Zealand. I am, quite simply, wondering about how other countries are managing their borders. For those who have a plan to travel anywhere at the moment, I would think it is proper due diligence for individuals to become educated regarding the details of border regulations so that people can ensure they are capable of adherence. Responses like yours do nothing but silence people."
"This may help from the NZ websiteWhat does self-isolation mean?Self-isolation means staying away from situations where you could infect other people. This means any situation where you may come in close contact with others (face to face contact closer than 1 metre for more than 15 minutes), such as social gatherings, work, school, child care/pre-school centres, university, polytechnic and other education providers, faith-based gatherings, aged care and health care facilities, prisons, sports gatherings, restaurants and all public gatherings.If you are a visitor to New Zealand, this means you should avoid sitting in a restaurant, or participating in any type of tour group."
"Marek, that will teach you for answering a query from a new poster!"
"I’m completely bamboozled by the conflicting advice I’m currently seeing. Maybe this is understandable given the speed things are moving.The advice quoted by GTS above implies that anyone self isolating needs to avoid any sustained contact with others. Staying 1m away from others for 15 minutes would allow all sorts of interactions to take place - you could get fuel in a car and go to the supermarket. It would even be possible to go to a restaurant.As an example this morning we went out for breakfast. We had very short interactions with two wait staff and one short conversation with one of them - nowhere near 15 minutes. Then we went to New World to buy some lunch and the only interaction was with a fellow shopper, a little old lady who couldn’t reach the soda water she wanted. All of our activity today would be OK under the above.But then we have also had Jacinda Arden suggesting that walking round the block is OK with the inference that nothing beyond that is.It’s all academic to us as we’ve been here for 6 weeks so we’re fine. But It doesn’t look like it’s possible to be arriving here as a visitor now if you can’t go into restaurants or shops to buy food. Presumably hotels and motels are out and on another thread someone suggested campervan were irresponsible too."
"John. I hope you wiped the Soda Water bottle down before handing it to the little old lady :-)It does sound as though the ""self Isolation"" may not be as drastic as first thought.However it does rely a lot on peoples common sense and good will, and I'm not sure how reliable that is.I guess the full impact and implications will become clearer in the next few days. In the meantime we wait and see, and stay safe."
"We have had to cancel our trip. I didn’t know it was going to be reviewed in 16 days, I thought I read it was in place until 30 June. We were travelling for 10 days over Easter. I didn’t see the point in travelling when you cannot get out and visit tourist destinations, join tour groups, go out to restaurants, etc. We have been told we will refunds back from all our pre booked tours - Weta, Hobbiton, Canopy Tours, Tamaki, waitomo caves, as I have cancelled within their cancellation timeframe to get full refunds. We have cancelled all our accomodation as well, car hire, etc If we had left it closer to the time, wait and see, we would may not have got full refunds. We just couldn’t afford to take that risk. I am yet to change my flights as Virgin have already said free cancellations, will wait until closer to April to change given the bulk of phone calls they are dealing with. It is so disappointing but as we are yet without financial penalty, it’s just something we have had to accept. I really do feel sorry for the tourism providers. We were happy to travel with the risk of virus, but now not with the self isolation requirement. It just didn’t make sense for our 10 day trip."
"We are taking a wait and see approach at the moment as we are booked to travel late June. At the moment, with the option available to change flights, our financial exposure is not huge. The self isolation terms explained above are not too onerous if accurate, given our plans. I imagine immigration and customs at the airport would be a lengthier interaction though.Of course we run the risk of isolation on coming home, so let’s see how it all pans out over the coming weeks."
"I'm in the same boat goldiegirl - we are booked to travel for June. Flights are with Virgin, but my concern is when will they cut off the ability to change said flights? How long do we wait? I haven't been able to find any info about that, and trying to call them is a nightmare - I'll try another day when things perhaps calm down a little. Luckily we are quite loose in our plans that we haven't booked all that much accommodation and I have put off booking a hire car at this stage."
"Hi,The advice is this will get worse before it gets better and not before the end of this calendar year at the earliest.I would postpone for the longest period you can without penalty if this option is available.Cheers,"
"What I don't get is why anyone would want to be in a plane for any length of time, be it one and a half hours, or 12 hours. I'd rather throw away the cost of the airfare"
Sometimes you have to. I have to fly to chch tomorrow for work then back again on Sunday. Normally I drive but this time it isnt possible. It is what it is. International flights are a different story.
"Out of curiosity - why do you have to?I have cancelled all work related travel, and there is only me in the office with everyone else working from home."
"I have an unavoidable hearing I need to attend, and not enough time after my last meeting today to drive. I guess if I really had to I could have cancelled meetings or drove late into the evening if truth be told, so to an extent you could argue it's a choice."
I don't think anyone is allowed in with coronavirus no matter what country you're from...
"I would sincerely like to keep it that way, Jeff. Unfortunately several with corona virus has slipped through the net, including a person who eventually tested positive but who flew into NZ on holiday. Not a returning Kiwi!I would like to see stronger measures in place for the visitors who do arrive into NZ. Compulsory covid-19 testing before they leave home, and with the certificate to show that they are clear. Meaning a possible delay before testing and arrival with the all clear certificate. This could result in a travel delay to be on the safe side for NZ and themselves.Edited: 7:43 pm, March 16, 2020 "
Frangipani I agree with you that is a great idea and if instigated would mean that idiot who left Australia after testing and not waiting for his results before heading to Wellington. I hope it cost him a bomb.Come on why would you go and get tested in the first place unless you thought you had issues and then leave the country straight away
"Exactly my sentiments, Gt. We dont have covid-19 here in the Cook Islands and wish to keep it that way. But steps need to take place to beef up our resilience and complacency here too. As I believe that NZ needs to. Drastic measures yes, but it will give all of us some reassurance meantime, knowing that both countries have a better screening process in place."
No. Not after 11.59pm tonight.
