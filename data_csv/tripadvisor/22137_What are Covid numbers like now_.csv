"There are extremely few currently active cases anywhere in the Canaries. And most cases involve African boat people whose boats were intercepted at sea by the authorities and who were quarantined before any contact with locals.In other words, effectively the islands are almost free of Covid-19. Please try to help us keeep it that way by obeying the rules."
