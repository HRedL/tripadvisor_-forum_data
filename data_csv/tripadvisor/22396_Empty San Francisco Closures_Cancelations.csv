"Photospread today from the Chronicle: https://www.sfgate.com/coronavirus/article/c…Not that some of these places wouldn't be considerably empty, depending on odd time of day - but you can see that things aren't normal. Here is a pretty thorough list of places and events that are closed or canceled. Notice that a lot of our museums and theaters are closed. https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article…"
SFMOMA says it is still open but all public programs and tours are canceled.
"de Young and Legion are open. But no docent tours or lectures. The libraries are open but no programs. You couldn't tell anything was out of the ordinary on Chestnut Street over the weekend. Could barely make one's way from Fillmore to Divis amid pedestrians, people with strollers, people with dogs, people eating and drinking at sidewalk dining spots. Disaster sells."
The most astonishing pictures are those of Lombard Street and Pier 39. When did we last see the crooked street or the sea lion dock so dead in broad daylight?
Thanks for posting those.
Lines for cable cars are very short.
Millennials are less worried than seniors.
"I had a dentist appointment last Friday and saw a cable car go by with only two passengers (near the end of the line) and no wait to get on at Powell turnaround.Today I popped out to get a haircut in Noe Valley at lunch - no easy parking, but not a ton of people. Weather is amazing today. Then stopped at Safeway near the Castro to grab bread & milk and do some light shopping to avoid weekend crowds. Their checkout system was like molasses. It was a good two minute wait after things were tallied that the system chugged along until it finished and printed a receipt. The check thought it was because Safeway was busy statewide, but my best guess is that the Internet is slow due to all of the remote workers in the Bay Area (including myself)."
"""Millennials are less worried than seniors.""I've seen a lot of flippant remarks to that effect on Facebook. To which I replace ""OK Boomer"" with ""OK Logan-5"" because I know they don't get the reference."
">>>, but my best guess is that the Internet is slow due to all of the remote workers in the Bay Area<<<That would explain why my connection has been so slow."
Ugh! Need a subscription to open the Chronicle.

In that SFgate link some events in June are cancelled! I hope we won't be living under the siege of the virus that long.
"I know many people care more about the Warriors than the theater - but tonight is the last performance for Hamilton and The Last Ship before the theaters go dark. They will reassess coming back on 3/25, but have no clear decision at this time.https:/…"
"We had tickets for today’s matinee that we exchanged for late April, but with the run scheduled to end in May, they may not bother to come back."
"They will come back. Unfortunately plays are done, re-done and re-done several more times here before they finally go away. Wicked and Book of Mormon are too that have been here waaaaaaaaaaaaaay more times than needed.I was shocked there wasn't a rethread in the lineup that was just announced.I have (had) tickets for tomorrow. They are refunding everyone."
Warriors games are stopped..... actually ALL NBA games are stopped until further notice.
"Excellent, Logan 5, approach and identify"
