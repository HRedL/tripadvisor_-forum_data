"Hi all,With the news today of the requirement for a negative coronavirus test in the previous 72 hours - it seems inevitable that the Greek Government will also require this for U.K. travellers imminently. We are due to travel on August 29th - with free cancellation/change of our flights and hotels due to run out on Friday. Given that the rules state;Passengers of flights from Bulgaria and Romania (as of Tuesday July 28th, 2020) and Malta (as of Wednesday August 12th, 2020 at 00.01 pm GMT+3) to Greece will be required to have a negative molecular test result (PCR) for COVID-19, performed up to 72 hours before their entry to Greece. This does not apply to Greek citizens, permanent residents of Greece and travelers for essential professional reasons. Travelers should be laboratory tested with RT-PCR of oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab.Only travelers who carry a certificate of a negative RT-PCR test result will be allowed by the border authorities to enter the country. The certificates should be written in English and bear the name and passport/national ID number of the traveler.The Laboratories that perform the RT-PCR testing should be:National Reference laboratoriesNational Public Health Laboratories orPrivate laboratories which are accredited from the respective national accreditation authorities (not necessarily specifically for COVID-19).""Do you think that a formal free NHS test would be accepted for U.K. passengers, who receive a short email and text message? Alternative places charge a minimum of £150 which would leave us unable to travel. We thought by leaving it 6 weeks or so things would have eased up - but it looks like we have missed a golden window for travel."
Why would you think that 'it seems inevitable that the Greek government will also require this for UK travellers imminently'.?Where is the evidence or reports from Greece that this is even being considered?Pure scaremongering and I trust that others will see this in the same light.
"There is currently no requirement for UK passengers to provide a negative test in advance of travelThe greek government have been specific about the countries they have asked this of - travellers from Bulgaria and Romania and Malta - no mention of UK passengers. It might be best to wait until requirements are announced, rather than speculate - as the earlier contributor has suggested.I am sure if anything is announced by the greek government - you will read about it on this forum."
"NHS tests will not be accepted as you need a proper certificate. You can only get these with a private test at the moment. I would not worry too much if you’re going on August 29th. We would need to be consistently seeing daily cases above 1,500 to match the countries added to the list today. It’s ticking up here but not huge increases. Only 816 cases today. The bigger issue is cases rising rapidly in Greece although it seems we have good news on that too today. Looks like the measures could be working."
Initial post....blatant scaremongering. Should this scenario develop then most who couldn't get this test would cancel surely.
"I’m also due to travel on 29th August.It’s fine if you want to speculate on various scenarios that might happen between then and now. However as long as it’s pure speculation, you can’t expect any one to be able to answer a speculative question with any degree of accuracy.if such a requirement were to be implemented, only the Greek authorities will determine what they will accept as evidence of a negative test."
>>Where is the evidence or reports from Greece that this is even being considered?<<There wasn't any evidence or report that Greece considered this measure for the 5 EU countries added to the list today. But it happened.
"I think people have been pretty hasty here to jump on my initial post. Given the unfortunate measures introduced today for many other European countries, it seems entirely 'plausible', though maybe not inevitable that such measures will follow for the U.K. It seems extremely reasonable to then open up the conversation to the forum and so those with hundreds, if not thousands of pounds invested in such a trip can hear the advice from those with recent experience and who may be well versed on the subject. Decisions have to be taken in the coming days for many (mine by Friday without a financial obligation) so I would appreciate feedback rather than hasty confrontation."
"I understand that Cyprus accept the NHS test as proof as long as the traveller can provide evidence of the time the test was taken i.e the appointment email. Should Greece require UK citizens to have a negative PCR, they may adopt the same policy although difficult to be sure!!"
"#9 The other countries mentioned have much higher rates per 100,000 of the population that the UK at the moment if that's any reassurance...https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueeaEdited: 3:09 pm, August 10, 2020 "
"“ it seems entirely 'plausible', though maybe not inevitable”—-Plausible does not equate to inevitable."
"Hello,We are from Belgium and are required to have the negative test up to 72 hours entry.We are supposed to fly on 22/08 (landing in Greece at 17:55, and take the test on 19/08 at 10:45, which will be a little more than 72 hours prior to arrival.Do you think we will be rejected the entry?Thank you in advaneOlesea"
That would be over 78 hours. If it says the test must be done at most 72 hours before arrival then personally I would not risk it and would rather book a later test.
