"We were supposed to leave for cozumel may 4th with the flu i think we will be canceling.Anyone else doing the same? we wont get our money back so thought about switcing to go to DR, but the weather report is alll rain"
"We're scheduled to go on May, 5. My wife is an MD... We're watching the CDC publications. We're still going. "
"As of now, there are no cases of swine flu on Cozumel or in the state of Quintana Roo. US, Mexican and other international health authorities are working all out to prevent the spread of this virus.Hydrate yourself well before you fly and wash your hands often during travel. Get Tamiflu if you want to. Cozumel is open, smiling and ready to receive you."
"As DS2 said, No reported cases here or a epidemic, or I would be packing my bags. Sitting put however, lots of sun...Shame you will lose the the money. Good luck...."
I am planning a trip to go very soon. I am not worried. 
"I wish more people would become well informed about media-hyped events, 2 months ago some people cancelled vacations to Cozumel because of the ""drug violence"", now some people are cancelling because of the ""flu"", neither the drug violence nor this flu are present in Cozumel, but the media just screams ""don't go to Mexico"" and uninformed people just buy into it....From the CDC's website:""CDC and state public and animal health authorities are currently investigating 8 cases of swine flu in humans in California and Texas that may be related to cases in Mexico. At this time there have been no severe illnesses or fatalities seen in the United States.To date, there have been no reported cases of influenza-like-illness in the resort areas along the coast of Mexico.""…cdc.gov/travel/contentSwineFluMexico.aspxI am not saying that all the measures being taken in Mexico and the US by authorities and people are not necessary, I am not saying there isn't a serious risk with this new strain of the swine flu (H1N1).I'm just saying that I don't think people need to cancel their vacations to Cozumel because of what is going on 1000 miles away in Mexico City..."
We are leaving May 3 from San Diego...Wouldn't cancel the trip unless the airport won't let me fly!! Can't wait to get there!!!
"we are syooise to go to cancun 1st week in July, but I have not heard of any swine flu on the yucatan peninsula. We both work in the medical field and will be taking a surgical mask with us to travel with..the experts are saying to just stay away from the big crowds, no shaking hands or kissing others.. I would suggest taking a small container of bacterial hand rub with you. "
"We have had our Cozumel trip planned since NOV 08! What with the border violence in Mexico,(nowhere NEAR Cozumel) and now the Swine Flu....We are leaving this Thursday. Does anyone know what Tamiflu is? Is it a medication used AFTER one appears to have the flu? Or can we take an injection prior to leaving? I just hope the doctors in Cozumel are prepared with necessary medicine, not just for the rare tourist, but for their own people.We are going. We go every year. If we got quarantined down there, we would be in heaven...we want to retire there, just not this soon, but we are going anyway.We are in Texas and it is raining, raining, raining. I do hope it is sunny next week in Coz. At least most of the time.I will be checking this board...until we leave, so if anyone knows about Tamiflu, please post."
"Tamiflu is recommended for prevention - you need a script, but taking it sounds like a good idea - call your MD!"
"Leaving for beautiful warm Cozumel on Friday - May 1 - CAN'T WAIT ! Mexico City is 1000 miles from Cozumel. Were going. We have to much money invovled and have been coutning the days for over 6 motnhs.We are bringing hand sanitizer and wipes. Have a good time. Life is to short.This time next week, I will be sitting on the beach."
"Oops, meant to add that Tamiflu is taken orally, not an injection."
"THANK YOU! I am calling our family doc and get our shots asap. Thank you again. I am so excited about going. This will make our 18th trip since 2001, and we count on it for the ""Calgon Take Me Away"" effects it has on the both of us, my husband and I. I seriously believe Cozumel has kept our marriage fresh and romantic for all of these years. Swine Flu, be damned! Calling the doctor now.Thank you again...Staying at the Presidente, as always, and we just cannot wait to get back to our paradise on earth--evem if it rains abit. We can handle that. And we will be pre-prepared with a vaccine.Thanks again for the medicine info. Got to get on that right now."
We are leaving for Cancun May 30. There are 7 mothers and 8 seniors going for their graduation trip. Firt it was the drug wars and half the people canceled on us. Now the swine flu. This is my third time going but my daughter has never been. She is looking so forwward to it. I don't want to loose my money but I don't want sick either. 
"We are still going. The way I look at it is saying you can't go to Detroit because there is an outbreak of the flu in Georgia. I am taking extra precautions - I have extra hand sanitizer, ant-bacterial wipes and if it seems like someone on the plane is ill, I have 2 surgical masks in my carry on. Going prepared, but still going.As for rain in the DR - it always says it is raining in the DR even when it is sunny all day. When it does rain it is really hard for 10-15 minutes and then the sun is out and it is dry in half an hour. Really a beautiful place to go. Melia Caribe Tropical is my favorite resort - good food & drinks and service you can't beat! If you don't go to Coz - go to DR, beautiful place."
"According to a live phone call from our Governor Felix Gonzalez Canto at the local News station (Sol Stereo), up to now Monday April the 27th there has not been presence of the flu in the state of Quintana Roo.Lets hope its stays that way and we are taking all preventive procedures to keep it that way even though they might look to extreme its better to preventStay in touch and we will keep reportingAdrian Angulo"
"Tamiflu does not prevent the flu, it is taken at the onset of symptoms and can lessen the severity and duration of the flu. It also does not provide relief for symptoms. The symptoms can be managed by OTC drugs. Also, as for now officials are not sure if a vaccine will be effective for this particular strain of influenza. Hope this helps. By the way I'm a doctor (just fyi) "
"Doc, You are a bit mis-informed. ""TAMIFLU is indicated for the prophylaxis of influenza in patients 1 year and older.""""The recommended dose for prophylaxis during a community outbreak of influenza is 75 mg once daily.""Cite: http://www.rxlist.com/tamiflu-drug.htm"
" I had a meeting with my friend who is a pharm-D yesterday and we discussed all of these matters. Tamiflu's website does talk about prophylaxis but this is post exposure. I think people may not understand what is meant by ""prevention"".If people take the drug for prevention having not been exposed then go to Mexico, or other places with known cases, a week or so later it probably would not be very beneficial. The website does stress that it is very effective when taken post exposure and during the first 48hrs after the onset of symptoms. Also if everyone runs in panic to gather up all the Tamiflu having not even been exposed, what will happen with others who really need the drug? This has already begun to become a problem in Tennessee. "
I have a trip scheduled to leave May 7 for 10 wonderful days. I am not sure what to do. I am leaning on continuing with my trip
"I am scheduled to leave on May 4th. Since I booked independently and used miles there is no penalty for changing my trip beyond the obvious disappointment of missing a fun time.My plan is to watch careful for any change in local conditions. If I was scheduled to fly out today I would go. However, if cases begin to pop up in Cozumel I would probably reconsider. I dive on small panga dive boats and it's really close quarters for 4 hours with lots of passing water bottles and fruit. I appreciate the local updates to really understand what's happening in Cozumel. So I'm wait and see. I don't watch TV news since I don't believe it to be a dependable source of the facts. So for my trips to Cozumel it's the NWS for hurricanes and the CDC for flu. Always an adventure and always fun! "
"We're leaving for Cozumel on Friday May 1st and have no plans to cancel - we go there twice a year and don't plan on missing our spring trip! My husband and I are both RN's so will certainly be able to take care of ourselves. Just the usual precautions of handwashing, staying away from sneezing and coughing. I'm more worried about being on the plane for all those hours from San Francisco! We fly thru Atlanta so will get a little break in between flights. By the way, Tamiflu should only be taken AFTER you have flu symptoms - it is not a preventative medicine and can actually make you more susceptible to getting sick as it will build up your resistance to the medication! We need to leave all the available Tamiflu for the people who are actually sick and not waste it on trying to prevent the flu - just my opinion .... Cozumel here we come!! "
"Scottish couple gets swine flu on honeymoon Buzz Up Send Email IM Share Delicious Digg Facebook Fark Newsvine Reddit StumbleUpon Technorati Yahoo! Bookmarks Print By JENNIFER QUINN, Associated Press Writer Jennifer Quinn, Associated Press Writer – Tue Apr 28, 8:55 am ETLONDON – They went to Mexico for their honeymoon, they came back with swine flu.A Scottish couple who are Britain's first confirmed cases of swine flu had just returned from their Mexican honeymoon, neighbors confirmed Tuesday.Dawn and Iain Askham became ill over the weekend, a few days after returning from Cancun. On Monday, health authorities said they had tested positive for the swine flu virus that is suspected of causing more than 150 deaths in Mexico.The couple were being treated in isolation in a hospital in Airdrie, between Glasgow and Edinburgh. Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon says they are recovering well.""She's doing OK. She's getting better,"" said Dawn Askham's father, Brian Colston.Neighbors of the Askhams said a paramedic had been seen on the street Saturday.""They were in Mexico for their honeymoon,"" said Rachel Anderson, who lives across the road from the couple in the town of Polmont. ""It is a shame for them, and I feel for their family. They will be very worried.""Britain's Foreign Office has warned residents to postpone nonessential travel to Mexico.Travel companies have begun canceling flights to Mexico and are preparing to repatriate British citizens there on vacation.Holiday tour operator Thomas Cook canceled all holidays to Cancun for the next seven days, and Thomson Holidays said they would not operate any more flights to Mexico until the Foreign Office changed its travel advice.But British Airways said it would continue to operate flights as normal to Mexico City, the airline's only destination in the country, though it was offering travelers the chance to rebook without extra change charges.In Warsaw, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said ""all the urgent action that is necessary"" would be taken to stop the spread of the virus.Brown urged people to consult a doctor if they have health concerns but stressed that Britain is ""among the best prepared countries in the world"" to fight the spread of the disease.Britain is holding an emergency government meeting on the issue later Tuesday.I just found this article on Yahoo. I am supposed to be going to Cozumel in June also.."
"Hi allYou may be interested in this story about Cozumel and swine flu precautions published today: ""Cozumel Ready As Ever"".See: http://www.thisiscozumel.com for the full story.¡Saludos!Ian"
"Another update from www.thisiscozumel.com today:""Some Cozumel Cruises Suspended""They will refund tour deposits to anyone that has booked with them.The full story is here: http://www.thisiscozumel.comIan"
Good Morning everyone. Getting ready to leave Friday am for Cozumel. Called Continental Airlines last night and they have no intention of cancelling any flights to Mexico from San Diego. Wheww what a relief. That would be the only thing that stops me from going. Counting the hours.....................
"Looks like we'll have the island all to ourselves!! No cases yet in Cozumel - statistically, we have a greater chance of being infected here in California! "
LOL - I was thinking the same thing. No cruise ships!
"Going to Cozumel Memorial Day weekend, can't wait. I live closer to Juarez than Cozumel is to Mexico City so i think I should be fine. I want a pina colada!"
"We have a trip planned in June: unless things go woefully wrong between now and then I'll be going. I live in TX, the flu is now in TX....might as well! I also have an unrelated dr. appt tomorrow, will talk to her about Tamiflu, I'm a little concerned about taking it prior to any illness; what if a person takes it as a preventive then still get's ill?... hmmm"
"Supposedly taking tamiflu before the symptoms may increase the chances you will get the flu. I just looked in my cabinet and found a Rx for it. My kids had ""influenza"" earlier this year and I was given a Rx ""just in case"" but never needed it. I wonder why we didnt have a big uproar when the strain of flu in Oklahoma didnt match the flu shot given out. My family all received a vaccination and 2 of the 4 still got the flu. That's 50% NEWSFLASH! I still have several weeks, I'll keep one eye on the news and the other on TA."
My family and I just got back from there and I have the sniffles from all the pollen up here in Massachusetts. I was just thinking:Cozumel is about 1000 miles from Mexico City which is the epicenter of the virus. There are no cases as far as I know in Cozumel. A huge chunk of the US population is within 1000 miles of Queenss NY which is our where our biggest outbreak is. Should everyone in the Eastern US stay in the house?If you go follow all precautions which include not making out with any pigs on the beach.
We are scheduled to leave June 1 for Cozumel. There are hundreds of people in the U.S. that die each year from the regular flu or pneumonia. It doesn't stop everyone from going shopping or in crowds. We could get sick at home if we cancel. We'll take precautions and use a lot of hand sanitizer.
Were going in July..got lots of friends coming..20 years of being married to the woman of my dreams...nothing is gonna stop us...6 couples...Cozumel here we come!!!!
We are booked to go in July. We are hoping the media will find something else to blow up!!! Going for my 20th anniversary...6 couples going...were booked!!! El Cozumeleneo here we come!!!!
i wouldn't cancel. don't be silly. i am going there may 7. can't wait
We just got back from Cozumel it was great. One of our friends had a cough and he went to the pharmacy there and got some Tamaflu and didn't need a prescription. Enjoy your stay!
"Do you know how much he paid for the Tamiflu? Just curious...nice to know they have it on the island too, thanks."
"Tamiflu can be taken as preventative or to shorten the course of existing flu. Your Dr. can write you a script. We just got enough for everyone here at the house (just in case), but had to wait 2 days to pick up as Walgreens had a shortage (which will probably get worse in the coming weeks.)I'm going to Coz in July and at this point have NO plans to cancel. An RN in TX"
"CP-yeh, I got a script for it yesterday but didn't fill it...won't unless needed. It's $99 soooweee"
"set to leave May 10. still up in the air whether we will go or not. I don't want to get down there and have everything closed and everyone paranoid. Oh well. I don't know if it is wise to bring a child. I will lose money...urgh. DR is too far. Also, DR has Malaria, so you just can't win."
I called my doctor and asked for Tamiflu. I told him I was going to Mexico. He said he can't give it out unless I was showing signs of the flu. What's up!!I wonder if the CDC sent out a memo on this? 
"Actually Tamiflu is to be taken at the first signs of flu symptoms. I think that if everyone does research on this type of flu, they will do much better than relying on the media. The media has done much to hype this alleged outbreak that has pushed everyone into a frenzy. I am scheduled to go to Cozumel on June 5th and still plan to go. If it was May 5th I would still go. Do your research. If you are not travelling with a young child, an older person, or someone who has a chronic illness, then your chances of dying from this flu are less than the regular flu. Regular flu causes around 36,000, yes, thirty-six thousand deaths a year. And that is not counting the number of people who contract the flu. Wash your hands frequently, keep hydrated and don't go out and try to catch the flu and you will probably be okay. The media has been very irresponsible in reporting this strain. They make it sound like it is ALL over Mexico, Texas, California etc. Sheesh, anything for ratings......."
"Regarding the cruises that are bypassing Cozumel or other vacation spots, I would be very agitated if I had booked on one of those. In his first 100 days of his Presidency, Obama has only said one thing that I agree with (or that makes sense) and that was his comment that referred to closing the borders was akin to closing the barn doors after the horses had escaped. Who is to say that there are zero people on the cruises that were not already exposed to this strain before they left? I would rather be on the beach with fresh air than in a stuffy room on a ship where everyone gathers for lunch or to touch the same cards, slot-machine arms, etc. The one case resulting in a death in the US was from a child who was brought here from Mexico. Another plug for Socialized Medicine. There may be more deaths attributed to H1N1 when people from Canada can't get in to be treated and sneak over the border from there for treatment, again too late. I am not aware of any US citizens that live in the US dying from the H1N1 strain. Will there be? Possibly, but I am really having a hard time believing that if someone in the US exhibits the symptoms and gets prompt treatment, there is more of a greater chance of dying from Montezuma's Revenge and Dehydration than dein the H1N1 virus. "
"My Dad lives and works in Cozumel and told me on Friday that no one was sick down there. He said everyone is still being cautious, but that everything was fine.You'll probably still cancel your trip I would guess, but just wanted to tell you that my source says it's safe down there."
"For all you iPod Touch and iPhone owners, a developer has an app for tracking the swine flu pending approval for the app store.tuaw.com/2009/…"
From the CDC web site. Under Antiviral Drugs CDC recommendations. You can take Tamiflu or Relenza for prevention if not ill (70%-90% efective) of the Swine influenza Type A H1N1 and Type B. But like I said my doctor would not give me any. I'm going to maybe try a Travel Doctor. I think they were told not to give out any unless you show symptoms.
"My Dr. gave me a script for it, which I won't fill unless necessary. I don't want to use it as a preventative because of possible side-effects."
"We are leaving Friday May 8th and are not rescheduling...I agree with the other Texan...media will do anything for ratings! We were aware of the same info he posted and it is completely true. We plan on having a great time and just washing our hands plenty. Anyone else going, have fun...you are just as likey to get exposed here as you are down there. And at least down there, you are on a beautiful beach!"
I came back Friday. No obvious signs of illness which is what I expected. Cancel if you wish but I see no reason to cancel a trip to Cozumel now. Of course I am not a CDC expert.
"I just arrived back as well.. no problems at all in Cozumel. I took tamiflu as a phrophylaxis measure to and have had no issues or side effects. Tamiflu is highly effective against preventing many types of flu and remains the most effective against swine flu.If you're cautious go to your doc and get a prescription and start taking it on the day you travel. Its a very cheap insurance policy, but most likely not even needed or necessary.Incidentally I didnt run into anyone exhibiting any flu like symptoms on my entire trip, but on the domestic portion of my flight home a good 1/4 of the plane was hacking up a lung. I thought it was hypocritical that everyone gives Mexico such a hard time but doesnt give a second thought about traveling with an unknown illness and potentially infecting others in the process."
We are suppose to go to Cozumel on Wed 5/13. I just called Continental Airlines to confirm if our flights are going and they are still flying there without any changes. I guess this is all hype by the media... We'll continue to monitor this until next Monday. This forum has been a big help
"Be aware that Continental IS cancelling flights. They just wiped out our reservations into Coz on 5/12 and out on 5/19. They offered a flight into Coz on 5/10 and out on 5/28! No apologies, no alternatives. Just a refund.After a couple desparate hours, I booked flights on American, and cheaper. BUT the flight into Coz won't accept a seat reservation. This was the first red flag with Continental, so I am not yet convinced we will actually get there next week!"
"News media says that the airlines are putting smaller jets onto the Coz route so you may be a victim of ""We don't know which equipment we'll be using."" Why not call AA & check your status?"
"Good idea. I just made the res at midnight, so I am letting the dust settle and will check it again later in the day. We have had so many setbacks on getting there this time that I am getting gun shy!"
