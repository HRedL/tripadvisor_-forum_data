"I am all set to arrive Morelia on January 23rd. on a previous visit to Acapulco I became quite sick, having the usual symptoms one associates with drinking the water. Last month I spent time in Nicaragua at sea level and positively thrived on the bursting with flavor food and potable water but have gotten seriously ill from something I imbibed in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. Can anyone tell me if gringos are particulalry susceptible to the food and water in Morelia and environs and if so, what precautions are called for?"
Drink only bottled water. Beyond that I eat most everything & everywhere. Watch the intake of liquor.
"Lots of precautions, search the site & google. It depends on you, your system. I eat tons of yogurt and take acidopholis, never sick here or Bolivia. Take along remedies, pepto etc., drink bottled water as peddler says, take it easy the first days. My MX friends get sick in USA for a few days, its the change of diet that makes the mild sickness, food poisoning is something else and you should go to the hospital. Really you know the difference. Also the altitude, you are from Miami and its different higher up.I guess Peddler we are lucky!"
"Thanks for these suggestions.I have some additional questions, that may seem obvious. Besides bottled water, do I need to worry about eating rice boiled in water? Do I need to peel the fruit? Or do I rinse it with bottled water? I am in good health, but do have a chronic condition and my doctor is a little worried-in the general sense. Any details folks don't mind sharing for one as uninitiated as myself. Thanks,K"
"Yes peel or wash in preventive soak all fruits & veggies especially lettuce. I've only been sick twice in Mexico once when I absent minded ate a unpeeled cucumber slice that was garnish on an appetizer & a wedge of lettuce I improperly prepared, That's it in 26 years.PS I always cook with bottled water especially coffee.Edited: 7 years ago "
The drinking water is normally not the problem - sea water or even swimming pool water is far more likely.
"Thanks for all these tips. Peddler665, Any suggestions on the type of preventive soap. Another friend suggested that, but didn't know the name. One other health related question. I have my Hep A shot and see Hep B isn't necessary. But the CDC recommends Typhoid shot and d then bug spray to protect against Malaria. Are either of those really necessary in the Monarch reserve area or Morelia?Thanks,K"
"Malaria isn't an issue (not been a malaria death anywhere in Mexico for over 20 years), typhoid crops up about once every 10 years in a few isolated places. Personally I wouldn't worry about typhoid but it's your decision."
"Thanks for the info. Good to know the reality. I didn't think it was, but figured I'd just ask. Seems the CDC is extra careful."
Steve FYI information I personally know 3 people who came down with typhoid in Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo last Winter. Two responded well to treatment the third did not.
"peddler - yes, it certainly happens. There was an epidemic in San Miguel a few years back too. It comes from the water I believe."
"I've been pondering this question for many moons trying to come up with a common denominator for what causes me to be unwell in some countries in the Americas and not others. I travelled around Argentina on two occasions and slurped up the tap water without a hitch. No worries in Santiago Chile, Colombia, San Pedro Sula Honduras, or last month in Granada Nicaragua. In Nicaragua the food was sooo flavorful. At first I figured that because Argentina and Chile are very well developed that one wouldn't need to worry. But Nicaragua isn't nearly as advanced as those two and I was fine, so there goes that theory out the window. When last in Mexico lindo I got nailed pretty bad and I'd scrupulously followed the bottled water only principle. Maybe I ate a salad or fruit that had been washed in the tap water. That was in Acapulco which is at a low altitude like Granada. So out the window with the altitude theory because I got nailed high in the Andes. The explanation eludes me. It doesn't seem to be how advanced in infrastructure or at what altitude a place is. Earlier in the thread some posters said that it's down to being away from my home patch but Argentina & Chile are about as far away as you could go in this hemisphere. Don't any of you have a sheep skin form MIT in water borne maladies peculiar to the Western hemisphere and environs in particular the Sierra Madre aquifer? How ridiculous eh?Edited: 7 years ago "
"Soak any fruit and veg you intend to eat raw in Microdyn or similar. All supermarkets sell it, and many local stores too.I keep all my jabs up to date when I go back to the UK, but I travel frequently and the jabs, with the exception of YF,are free there. I only take malarial prophylactics in s and se Asia and sub Saharan Africa and the Amazon region. The WHO is the best indicator of what to take and for where."
"Oh yes, the WHO. Pete Townshend headed up all their offices from Soho down to Brighton. Seriously though, reminding us to keep those jabs up to date could prove most helpful. Having attained a certain age, all my ""vacunas"" are freebies too and I'm sure they've saved my bacon. I'll make note of the Microdyn as I didn't know about it and my digs will have a kitchen. I booked with Eugenio over at Baden-Powell after reading the glowing nods of approval here from you lot.Salud, pesetas, amor, y tiempo para disfrutarlo."
Smart Choice! Eugenio has lovely apartments at budget prices. Also one very decent person.
"I personally have been very lucky (knock on lots of wood!!). I've spent lots of time in Mexico (a couple of years) and only been sick intestinally (not serious) twice. A couple of observations: Be careful where you eat spicy meats. Spicy barbecue can mask meat that is spoiled. My ""rule"" for where to eat is to avoid places that seem to cater to tourists only. They do not depend on return business and are often less careful. I only go to places that are crowded with local people who are not very poor. If you see Mexican middle class families with their kids, or business people with clients, you know it is safe. For some reason, people who drink a lot of alcohol seem to get sick more often....don't know why...maybe they eat things they shouldn't while drinking???Don't drink the water in the shower. Don't use tapwater when brushing your teeth. Don't let yourself get rundown. Some people vacation like it's the last vacation they will ever have."
"Kind of a trip report on that...not only did I not get sick but I found that I felt more robustly healthy than in a long time. The food is good. I saw trucks laden with the freshest fruits and veggies coming up to Morelia from the low, tropical zone on the West coast. The pineapples were all golden; not mostly green. there were apples, blackberries, mangos, guavas, etc. At the Mercado SanJose and at the Mercado El Niño they whip up the absolute best smoothies I've ever had for only a buck. I accidently over-paid and they corrected my mistake without hesitation plus gave me a tutorial on the money so that I wouldn't repeat the mistake. At El Niño I had the best Chile Relleno milanesa in the known world! My health just got better and better. Yum!"
