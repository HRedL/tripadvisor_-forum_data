"Hello,Where exactly does this leave from at Palermo Centrale? And I am right to say they leave every 30 minutes (on the hour and half hour?)? (I need to take a bus at 7am) And tickets can be bought on boarding?Thanks in advance !"
"If its not changed recently , they leave from the piazzale in front of the station."
"Hi Andrew, the bus leaves from terminal Fazello, here:https://maps.app.goo.gl/eT7jfGLJWnGDHvgJABut you can also access it from inside the central station following the indications, consider it's next to platform 10."
"Hi Andrew,Prestia e Comandè runs the airport bus service from via Fazello. Buses depart every 30 minutes.https:/…It's optimal to purchase your ticket online in advance for reserving your seat and priority boarding.Why should I buy the ticket in advance and not on the bus?https://www.prestiaecomande.it/en/faq/Vagabonda"
"Hi, does anyone know if the 'Prestia e Comandè' bus stop ""Via Emerico Amari, 170 (Politeama)"" stops outside the Teatro Politeama? Thanks"
#4Yes
"Hi Jack_Da_Lad19,Depending on your direction; to the airport or from the airport, there are two different Politeama stops.From the train station to the airport, the bus stops at Politeama Piazza Ruggiero Settimo, 18, and that's near Teatro Politeama.https://tinyurl.com/y5jwbybyGoing from the airport to the train station, the bus stops at Via Emerico Amari, 170 but a 10-minute walk.https://tinyurl.com/y6e9ajouVagabonda"
"V, Via Emerico Amari has been closed to traffic for a while due to the extension of the tram system.From the airport the bus now stops almost opposite Politeama then, Via Dante, Tribunale, Capo, Teatro Massimo, Via Cavour, Via Roma, station."
"In reply to Jack, yes but not the usual stop but only a few metres away."
"Hi 4,It's still closed?! I knew that via Emerico Amari was closed to traffic, but that was a long time ago. And the bus company hasn't updated their website in all this time.So exactly where is it stopping?Thanks in advance.V."
"Hi V,Apparently it's likely to be closed for a few years yet as the work continues on the Politeama Metro station.I don't as yet know the stops but would imagine at least one at each of the places mentioned above.I'll let you know any details as and when.I'm now going to drown my sorrows as Watford were relegated this evening..."
"A friend in the UK also drowned sorrows....Sincerest sympathies!Considering the airport train closure for years, there really shouldn't be any surprise here, but still hopes for a faster conclusion.Thanbk you in advance for any updates...V."
"Btw, FYI, the driver wouldn't sell me a ticket on the bus at the train station, one has to go to the ticket office - I was 10 minutes early and first there so it was fine, but just for people to be aware if a queue at ticket office etc."
"Hi Andrew,that's strange, I've never heard of that happening before, anyway enjoy your trip to Palermo."
