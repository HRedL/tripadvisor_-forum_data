Hi my husband and I have annual leave booked from 20th June for two weeks. We cannot change the dates. Wanted to go to Lisbon and Sao Miguel. I know no one knows when Covid 19 will stop travel plans etc but do you realistically think we could book holiday for this time or am I completely off the mark?
"Even if you decide to travel in June, tourism will not have recovered and it is unlikely that things will be up and running by September, never mind June. Don't travel in June, reschedule for a time when recovery is advanced"
"do you realistically think we could book holiday for this time - no. If what the government is trying to do is successful will be slowly starting to go out of these strict rules by the end of May, so nothing will be ""normal"" in June. In fact both main cities in Portugal (Lisbon and Porto) have just announced that their annual festivities (which are in June) have been canceled."
I have booked for middle of August this yearDid you end up going?
The Azores still has stricter entry requirements than the mainland. Please do check these before travel. These will no doubt deter many travellers.These can be seen at https://www.azoresairlines.pt/en/mandatory-p…and elsewhere.
"is it 72 hours before departure (as stated in links in post 4) or as I've read on another thread ""Anyone in Azores now"" it needs to be within 72hrs of landing - post 11 on that thread said his wasn't accpeted as 72 hrs before departure...."
"it needs to be within 72hrs of landing - this is my understanding,"
"Maybe someone should tell Azores Airlines that so that they have the correct info on their website!and the Azores Governmenthttps:/…AAs_20200615_VF.pdf""In this case you will have to show the physical document issued by a lab that proves that the test for SARS-CoV-2has been performed within the 72 hours before your departure from the origin airport.

"This is very concerning. We also have flight from Porto in 6 August and we schedule the testing in a lab in Porto on 3 August, around 70 hours before the flight.I also sent an email to the tourism info office in Ponta Delgada to find out if this could be an issue.It's sad because there are rules that we follow strictly and we cant be sure that we'll be allowed in even if we do everything stated in the governments guidelines."
"Vlad please post the reply you get and how you actually get on. Testing in the UK ( unless you have symptoms) is difficult to find, mostly only postal tests."
"HelloI just received confirmation from Airport Tourism Office in Ponta Delgada:Negative test must be taken up to 72 hours before your flight departure (before embarkation)So the information on the government website is accurate, at least this is what they say.I also think that you need to take the test in an accredited laboratory (only Portugese facilities). There was a link to the list of labs somewhere in the forums ."
"Thanks Vlad, would you mind giving me the email address you for confirmation of 72hours before flight. Also UK is offering tests (mostly in London, which we aren't) in the range £150-£300, but often say that its 48-72 hrs for results and sometimes that is working days. We land around 5pm on a Sat (6pm UK time). so if done on Wed it might get rejected and if done on Thurs morning might not have results in time."
"Sure, The address is: pt.ae.smg@azores.gov.ptI would suggest to fly into mailand Portugal (Porto or Lisbon), spend 2-3 days there, take the test in an approved lab (by the way it's free of charge if you provide flight tickets to Azores and payment proof) and then take a flight to Azores from there."
Thanks for email addressUk is advising against travelling to mainland Portugal! So can't get insurance and if I have to isolate for 14 days on return to UK as currently don't have enough holiday!
"Sorry Melanie, but Azores although on the list of ""countries and territories have been assessed as no longer presenting an unacceptably high risk to British people travelling abroad"" the region is not on the ""List of countries and territories from where you can travel to England and may not have to self-isolate."" so either coming from the mainland or the Azores you'll have to do a quarantine... https:/…coronavirus-covid-19-travel-corridors"
"Sorry ptnov64 I can't find Madeira/Portugal on the list in your link aboutCountries and territories with no self-isolation on arrival in Englandand you are still advised not to go to Portugalhttps:/…portugalEdited: 10:25 am, July 20, 2020 "
"That's the point, Madeira and Azores are NOT included in ""Countries and territories with no self-isolation on arrival in England"" please check it carefully before booking your vacations..."
If they are NOT on the no isolation list then surely you have to isolate....
"Sorry couldnt edit I've been doing this whilst also do work emails and haven't read properly. I know you have to isolate on return that's what I said in post13, which you seemed at first glance to contradict in post 14by saying sorry. Holiday was booked back in November well before this kicked off."
"Vlad, I'd like to know what actually happens in your case with the test timing as I've seen on other threads just now.""However make sure your test is within 72 hours from ARRIVAL in Azores, not departure. That is what seems to count here."""
