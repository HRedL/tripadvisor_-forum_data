"Hello, I will travelling from UK to Geneva for a few days arriving on Mon 31st Aug. I was planning to spend 2-3 days visiting Chamonix and Annecy returning each day to my hotel in Geneva. Can anyone tell me if the border between Switzerland and France is open and are there any covid quarantine rules between the two countries?Ian"
It was open on 31st July and nothing has changed between the two countries since then but who knows what the case will be when you visit. All trips at the moment have to be very flexible and you have to be ready to move quickly if things change. Good luck.
Thanks. Things do change very quickly and as you say we need to very flexible. Thanks again.Ian
"GenÃªve is currently a Covid-19 hot spot, coded red, and Belgian citizens, at least, are prohibited from travelling there."
"Thanks. I saw this too and will be keeping a low profile in Geneva and will avoid bars, restaurants etc."
"BBC is reporting today that traveling back from France to UK starting August 15th, people will have to quarantine for 14days. This may have to be considered if you fall in this situation."
Thanks for this and I became aware of this yesterday too. All a bit frustrating as the hot spots in France are Paris and around Nice. I haven't heard of many cases in the Alps.
I'm thinking now to postpone until October. I understand that Aiguille du Midi gondola runs all year round. Does anyone know if the cog train to Montenvers and gondola to Le Brevant run at this time of year?
"None of the cable cars operate year round, they all have closure periods to allow routine maintenance to take place and naturally these closures are normally planned for quiet periods. The gondola from the Aiguille du Midi only operates during the main summer season and even then is weather (mainly windspeed) dependent. There is a website that gives the operating dates (and times) for each cable car, although it can be subject to change if problems occur.There is no point in going up in any of the cable cars unless the weather at the top is clear (and the weather at the top can be quite different to the weather in the valley). Summer probably offers the best chance of clear weather but the autumn is often good too."
We were hoping to fly into Italy and start the trek from Courmayeur and end there - does anyone know if there are border checks during the hike
You have to carry your passports anyway so whether or not there is a border check is almost immaterial. There is always the possibility of checks (which don't have to be at the actual border) and they are more likely if restrictions are in place.
