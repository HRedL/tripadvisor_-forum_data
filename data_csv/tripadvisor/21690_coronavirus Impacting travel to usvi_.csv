"I saw a post that the wait time at STT airport has been longer than normal. I’m wondering what, if any, reports of coronavirus have been reported in the USVI? Any precautions being recommended for travelers? My husband and I are supposed to depart from US next week and are feeling a little nervous given the increase in number of cases."
"The wait time has been due to a temporary relocation of customs, and today's update says they hope to have it back to normal by tomorrow 2/8. So hopefully that won't impact you."
There have been no cases of the new coronoavirus in the US Virgin Islands - nor in the Caribbean or Latin America.
"it wasn't back to normal I waited in customs line for 2.5 hours. There were much needed repairs in the old customs section, this is the cause for delays in the new custom lines...was just there 2 days ago and unfortunately it wont be changing Anytime soon according to updates"
"sbeth1982, the VI Port Authority has announced that everything will be back to normal this Friday the 28th at both the marine terminal and the airport."
https://m.facebook.com/USVIPORTS/
"A sparsely populated island like STJ would likely be one of the best places to be during an outbreak. At least for avoiding contracting it. Now, if you needed intensive medical care, that's a different issue.But, if fear grips the world, people may become fearful of passing through airports and therefore all travel and that might have an impact on all vacation travel, regardless of the location."
The coronavirus hyperbole is typical of the media but this site and its statistics is most informative:https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/
"Does anyone on Tortola know when the ""official"" coronavirus testing results from the resident who recently returned from China will be released to the public? It should be by tomorrow given the 4 days to send sample off island. Thank you."
"MarthaD, probably better to post on the Tortola forum. Tortola is in the British Virgin Islands."
"As the OP, I just wanted to share that my husband and I traveled to STT without incident. We’ve been home one week."
I have the same concerns and am following this post.
"We are supposed to go to St John this Saturday, March 7. I am also following this post..any news would be welcome! Thanks!"
"We just returned from the British West Indies (St. Martin and Anguilla) and there was no heightened concerns vs. other trips to the Caribbean. The only difference you will see is some more diligence on normal hand washing and the customs officials will ask you if you have recently been to China. We practiced our typical hygiene, I would definitely not let the Coronavirus influence travel to the USVIs !"
Neither would I . I am going to STX in May and hope that air travel does not get affected.
We're also watching and praying airfare doesn't get affected... Going to St. John the end of May and then Virgin Gorda the first week of June.
We have friends leaving for the islands this Saturday and then we leave next Tuesday. Currently in packing mode!
I hoping since we are US citizens traveling to a US island travel would not be affected for us.
"Hopefully, but you never know what restrictions might be put in place."
"Three people tested in the British Virgin Islands came back negative. Also, some experts believe the virus cannot tolerate warmer temperatures."
"That is just theory, the medical experts do not know if it is true. There a plenty of cases in warm countries like Singapore and the Middle East.The concern is not whether or not the virus is in the VI, at least for me, it is whether or not air travel will be affected and we will be able to get there (and back!).fingers crossed!"
I’m just worried about flights being cancelled. We arrive 3/24.
I am scheduled to travel 4/1-4/7 out of New York. Delta is waiving change fees due to Coronavirus concerns. I haven’t cancelled my plans but I’m getting worried. My concern is 1) the airport 2) the thousands of people arriving to the Virgin Islands from cruises all over the US/world. I’m currently waiting it out. What to do? What to do?
Maybe a good thing to do is avoid the hyperbole and check actual statistics. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/
"and compare with flu data for just the US. If you wouldn't cancel for flu, I certainly wouldn't cancel over this.https:/…preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm"
"I have a medical background and my family leaves in 7 days for STJ. We're stocked up on travel size hand sanitizer with refill bottles in our checked snorkel bag and we have cavi wipes for surfaces. We'll wash our hands thoroughly and keep them away from our faces unless they're clean. There are a lot of bugs out there that can kill you, COVID-19 just happens to be the one being sensationalized right now. On a side note, they did just cancel the HIMSS healthcare conference in Orlando next week so that was interesting. We're going to be smart about clean hands and enjoy our trip!"
Good point Snorkeler-6!
Here is an interesting article. https://viconsortium.com/vi-opinion/virgin-i…
I was hoping that nobody would bring up that and a related article. The same thing happened last week in St Martin when the media there jumped on the fact that three people had been tested for the coronavirus and that test results were pending. Unfortunately (but typically) this within moments was passed around and the claim was made that three people on St Martin HAD been confirmed with the virus.A day later the tests were returned negative but the heresay had already made the rounds.There are no confirmed cases in the US Virgin Islands and the samples which were sent out for testing as a precautionary measure came back as negative.The hospital and all health facilities here are prepared.
Has St Thomas taken steps regarding cruise ship docking and passengers in regards to Covid 19?Now that the CDC recommendations now say to avoid cruises for the time being what is the islands plan to deal with the tens of thousands of passengers that visit the island daily from cruises.
"The ships notify the island if they have sick passengers and the port can refuse docking. The Coast Guard has flown test kits to at least one ship so that suspected passengers can be tested. The VI hopes to get test kits from the CDC when the other states get theirs.I don't think there's a shortage of hand sanitizer here, and many places keep it in a visible location so employees and customers can freely use it.People are encouraged to not shale hands.Any visitor can potentially infect people here, so everybody needs to be vigilant."
"""While much of the country continues to grapple with a shortage of testing kits for the coronavirus (COVID19), the VI Department of Health said it will soon be able to conduct tests of nasal and oral swabs for the coronavirus, also known as COVID19. “We have received the test kits and will be able to conduct testing on-island,” said Dr. Esther Ellis, D.O.H. territorial epidemiologist. With local testing capabilities, the number of people tested — and the potential for suspicious cases will increase. """
Thanks for the update. Good news!
Maybe awful to say but I wouldn’t be terribly sad if cruise ships couldn’t dock while we are there in a few weeks. It would be nice to avoid those crowds in general.
Should I cancel our trip this Saturday to St. John? I am concerned about people coming from Europe and China into the airport at St Thomas who may be infected.
"Angela S. Only you can make that decision. If I could get on a plane Saturday and go to St. John I would be dancing a jig. If you have underlying health concerns and your doctor's advised you from going anywhere, dont go. If you are just afraid, use good common hygiene protocol."
Almost all our visitors are from the mainland US. Very few from Europe and Asia.
Thank you! I guess anxiety is getting the best of me!
"That’s good to know! Thank you! We are so excited to go, but this virus does have me concerned. We are not in the high risk category. I think anxiety is getting the best of me!"
We are too. Nerve wracking.
At this point you are just as likely to come in contact with this virus in your own community. It is becoming more apparent by the day that community spread is already prevalent here. That being said if I were over 60 with pre existing conditions or immune compromised I would be sticking close to home for the next 2 months if for no other reason then proximity to my health providers.
With the hysteria I’m starting to become afraid our flights will be cancelled in a few weeks. I really hope not.
"I'm getting a little concerned with flights as well. We leave May 30th, and thankfully have a direct flight."
"We are supposed to leave March 26th and are in a dilemma. In Mass, we currently have the 4th largest amount of cases in the U.S. so I’m already taking precautions. But, I have an autoimmune disorder with underlying resp issues that are currently stable. I am supposed to go on steroids for the trip so I can function throughout the week but my doctor said the steroids could cause problems with the virus being so contagious. So, the steroids are out. But, I’m still higher risk. But, I’m trying to decipher what is media fear mongering and what is true risk for me. My husband is very healthy. I see my pulmonologist next week so hopefully he can be of some guidance. Also FYI, if you’re flying Jett Blue, they’re waiving change and cancellation fees. If you cancel, you get vouchers good for a year.Edited: 5:15 pm, March 11, 2020 "
I would read the recommendations from the CDC. Right now they recommend that people over 60 and those with underlying conditions should not fly. We are dealing with a similar problem but have until mid April to decide.
"Hi,Did you travel to st john? If so do you know of any nice cheap hotels or villas?"
"Jay, if you have questions on a villa, post a new thread with your wishes and budget and you will get some help. People’s definition of “cheap” is vastly different."
"In Puerto Rico there are 159 suspicious cases around the island and test are taking to long, the CDC is taking a long a time to with the results. The government is not being honest about the spread."
"We ( my son, d-I-l, 2 grands, elderly sister, and myself) are to leave Saturday the 14 of March! After Trump has closed some countries from coming or going and the NBA and NCAA cancelling fans and/or games, I have be our very concerned! We hat my get to St Jihn but not get home! I’m leaning toward cancellation! My heart hurts for all who are affected with this disease!"
"I am concerned too after hearing that European travel is banned. I guess the more I watch the news, the more anxiety I get. I am still in the fence on postponing this trip. We leave Saturday am!"
"Since there are no cases in the USVI and it is US territory, I don't think they would prevent you from coming home. Also, the European travel restrictions apply to non-US citizens. They are putting procedures in place for US citizens to enter certain areas of enhanced screening."
"We are in similar predicament as others. Supposed to fly out on Sunday and struggling to decide about cancelling.I really have to wonder if there are truly no cases in USVI or if people have symptoms, but aren't being tested."
Friends keep telling us to go bc it may be awhile before we can travel again.
We are in the same boat. And I think those are all legitimate concerns. Things are progressing and changing so rapidly that I fear a recommendation on - no nonessential travel in the near future. Very frustrating on all fronts.
"I spoke to the person who made all of our travel plans on St John. Presently, there are no cases there. That may change with spring break just starting. She also said that travelers are not cancelling their trips. Salt water therapy is what we all need!"

"Lindas Tripp’s; I agree with you. And, I don’t think it’s just the USVI. I think there are tons of cases we don’t yet know about...everywhere.Edited: 10:18 am, March 12, 2020 "
"We are set to leave for STJ on 3/30 from Massachusetts and although we are a bit anxious about any exposure to the virus that we might encounter while traveling there (and back) we are coming! We do have a question for some of you who have been there recently or who live there, is Star Market normally stocked with supplies? I ask because in MA people have been buying toilet paper like it’s going to disappear from earth! Store shelves are bare! Will we be able to get our essentials in the food/supply stores there?"
That’s a great question. I was just at Stop and Shop in Belchertown and shelves are bare...even food products. We’re supposed to leave on the 26th but are considering canceling as I have underlying health issues. I hope you enjoy your trip!!
"We are from the Northampton area and all the supermarket shelves are bare in certain sections. We have gone back and forth about whether to cancel and are afraid but are pretty sure we’re going to risk it but be very careful. Masks on the plane and maybe the airport and definitely in the van on the way to the ferry, scrupulous hand washing, tons of hand sanitizer when we can’t wash, wipes for the seat area of the planes, etc... then we just hope and pray!"
"AmyG, nobody here is in panic mode and the supermarkets are well stocked even with TP!!!"
We come in less than two weeks. I’m just crossing my fingers our flights don’t get cancelled .
"Coming at the end of April with no intent to cancel unless trip is cancelled for me. Yes, I am certain there are numerous undiagnosed persons out there, but some have such mild or no symptoms that they don't seek testing. Coronavirus has been around a long time and compared to other pandemics, this one, so far, has not been as bad. China is on the downslope, so hopefully, it will be that way here, soon. If you are high risk, something to consider, but otherwise, no reason to panic. Use same precautions as for flu, colds, etc."
"For those of you who leave for St John soon, please let us know how things are there, and if the stores still have food and toilet paper. It's gone here in the Houston area."
"This version IOC the corona virus is brand new. It has not been around a long time. Hence the scientific alarms.Edited: 1:29 pm, March 12, 2020 "
I am just wondering if my girl is telling me that so we don’t cancel!
I will keep you posted!
"Yes, just as the flu is a new strain each year."
"I tend to believe documented facts. The recovery rate of those infected who did NOT already have compromised immune systems is currently 93%. Not everybody is ""minimizing the issue"" but there certainly is a whole bunch of hysteria and hyperbole making the rounds. This is an excellent site for keeping track of the virus's passage which goes into extraordinary detail above basic figures: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"
"The mortality rates will be higher until more people are tested. Right now there could be thousands more who have had and survived the virus who never sought treatment, but we won't know because they weren't tested, inflating the mortality rate. That doesn't mean its not a serious issue, but time will only tell what the real rates are once more testing is available."
"I am on island now. I have only been to the store a few times for essentials such as water, beer and wine. I haven’t noticed shelves being empty in Starfish Market, St John Market or Dolphin Market. Our villa is well stocked with TP since we got here, so I have had no reason to look for it in the store. On any given day you may get to a store before their regular delivery of a certain item, but each store have stock personnel busily refilling the shelves. Driving through Cruz Bay this morning on the way to the beach, I didn’t notice any reduction in people walking or driving around. Cars were parked along the road by Hawksnest on the way back, so beach activity is pretty normal. Any restaurant that we have gone to since we got here has been full. We will be going back to Cruz Bay for dinner tonight. I fully understand the seriousness of Covid-19, but we have no reason to shorten our stay here."
"We are scheduled to head to STT next week (3/18). We are from OH and they’ve just closed all schools in the state for the next 3 weeks, cancelled any gathering with more than 100 people, etc. This is after 5 confirmed cases in the state. We have every intention of heading to STT assuming our flights will not be cancelled. Although we can change our flights, there is no cancellation with the home we booked."
"We are waiting a few weeks to decide about our trip in mid April but we are not hopeful that the situation will improve by then. We are basing our decision on current CDC recommendations that people over 60 and anyone with a compromised immune system not fly on airplanes. Two of our group are over 70 and a younger one has a compromised immune system. I alerted our villa company and they suggested we wait a few weeks before making a final decisionThey repeated their recommendation for insurance which we have but it will not cover this situation. . The possible silver lining is that they said rebooking the villa at a later date was a decision the owner of the villa would make.,"
The reaction is based on what actually happened in China and now is occuring in Italy. What at first appears to be a small amount of cases then a sudden spike in numbers with 20% of that spike requiring immediate hospitalization and intensive care. This happens all at the same time and overwhelms the country's health care ability to cope. Hence the #flattenthecurve.
I have a couple of questions regarding the travel ban and how things in USVI are being handled.Does the 30 day travel ban include USVI? So no flights from Europe coming in to USVI? Is that correctAnd then how are things being handled as far as the cruise ships? Are cruise ships now banned from docking? I am sure there are many European travelers on cruises so I would assume cruises would be banned? Just trying to wrap my head around this.
Cruise ships can be turned away for many reasons. I read earlier about a ship or ships being denied entry to St. Thomas today after being turned away in St. Maarten which was their originally planned port.
"Thank you for your post. We are supposed to leave from Dallas to StT this Sat. Have been wondering what the atmosphere is there...grocery store shelves, etc. It’s crazy here with products being unavailable."
"There are no direct flights from Europe to the USVI.Cruise ships are not banned from docking as yet. Celebrity's Princess and Viking lines are ceasing their cruises temporarily.The local facts are as follows:""Royal Caribbean cruise lines' Grandeur of the Seas was denied entry to the Crown Bay Dock in the early morning hours on Thursday because a crew member had traveled to Japan within the past 14 days, according to Government House. The ship had attempted to make an unscheduled stop on St. Thomas due to a medical emergency unrelated to the coronavirus (COVID-19) scare sweeping the Caribbean. A passenger aboard the ship apparently suffered a broken hip. That passenger, however, was permitted to come ashore for medical treatment of their injuries. The person was evacuated by the U.S. Coast Guard and taken to Schneider Regional Medical Center for the treatment of a broken hip later Thursday morning, said Government House Communications Director Richard Motta. That passenger had undergone proper screening and displayed no symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19), Mr. Motta said. The crew member in question had not tested positive for COVID-19, either, he said. Mr. Motta sought to assure the public Thursday afternoon that only the one passenger disembarked for treatment. And that passenger has not tested positive for COVID-19. ""Screening precautions have been taken and that person is not symptomatic of the coronavirus,"" Mr. Motta said. ""I want to make this point: No one on the ship has confirmed coronavirus. It is just the precaution that the one crew member has traveled from a region that has been flagged within the 14-day period,"" he said.The incubation period for someone infected with the virus is up to 14 days, meaning the patient might not display symptoms for two days to two weeks.The Grandeur of the Seas had previously been turned away from a port call on Antigua the previous day due to the crew members possible exposure to COVID-19 in Japan.""I can assure you that between the cruise lines and our local health apparatus, we are taking all the necessary precautions,"" Mr. Motta said.The Holland America cruise ship MS Koningsdam pulled into St. Thomas Harbor in the early morning hours on Thursday after a onboard medical emergency unrelated to COVID-19, said Department of Tourism Director Joseph Boschulte.""The reason the ship came in last night was medical, but not COVID-related,"" Mr. Boschulte said. Passengers were screened and cleared by the U.S. Coast Guard and local health officials before being allowed to leave the ship, Mr. Boschulte said. The Koningsdam spent Thursday at the WICO Dock.""As far as grocery stores are concerned there is absolutely no difference from any other day. Nobody is panic-buying, nobody is walking around in hazmat suits or masks and when I went shopping today for toilet paper it was an uneventful experience."
Thank you for the very specific info. Appreciate it! Will be there on Saturday.
"I am on island now. The restaurants and beaches are busy. I walked by LongBoard, Woodys, Tap and Still and LaTapa last night - all were full. I tried to make a reservation at LaTapa for Friday night but they were fully booked. The St. Patrick’s Day Parade is going on as planned on Saturday.Got to get away for a few hours today and went to Hawksnest - had to park on the side of the road due to the parking lot being full.Yesterday morning I was over on St. Thomas. Cost-u-Less was fully stocked with cleaning supplies, toilet paper, food etc. It was pretty quiet - but it was a Wednesday. Home Depot was also fully stocked - the only item I could not find was hand soap. But I found hand soap at Pine Peace Market - they had plenty. Starfish and St. John Market are normal - plenty of everything and plenty expensive lol. Everything is just as usual. Naturally the virus is the topic of conversations with friends but nobody is freaking out.Getting on a flight might be a concern - that is totally understandable but things here on island is paradise as usual. My personal opinion is that I would not cancel my vacation.Edited: 10:37 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"I’m coming from the US and am supposed to get married in St. Thomas in a month. I’m not concerned about the travel there, but the travel home. Many of my guests are in the health field and will be required to wait 14 days upon returning before going back to work. That means taking 3 weeks off of work, 2 of them potentially unpaid. If the hysteria worsens and we are quarantined on the way home, my fiancé (small business owner) won’t be able to ship orders for a month and his business will likely go under. My matron of honor has a 3 month old so she definitely can’t go. My fiancé’s parents are immunocompromised so they now can’t go. My wedding planner refuses to work with us to postpone the wedding or numbers of people planned, without a $3500 fee. I’ve been working overtime for over the past year to pay for this wedding. I don’t know what to do!!!"
"We fly Sunday the 22nd but I’m holding my breath. I really hope we still get to fly.Edited: 5:53 am, March 13, 2020 "
"Just curious, what do the people on St. John prefer regarding visitors? Do we come or do we reschedule and stay away? Is St. John equipped to handle this if someone brings the virus to them?"
"Of course we're all concerned of the inevitability of the coronavirus reaching our islands and obviously there are hard times ahead with all the cancellations which are growing in number every day. The next few months are going to be very rough for everybody as we depend on tourism for our bread and butter, regardless whether or not we actively work in the tourism industry.However, we're not in panic mode and, at least from my standpoint, we only suggest that prospective visitors make up their own minds. Obviously if you're at high risk with a compromised immune system for whatever reason you should stay put.Medically we're as prepared as we can possibly be given our very small community and that's really all that can be said."
It's a tough call for sure. I'm giving it a few more weeks to decide what to do.
That’s nice because I have seen in a Facebook group that tourists are not welcome.
"FB and social media in general tends to bring out the worst in people and, on the new subject of the virus and visitors, the nastiness and trolling is coming from both sides.That ""tourists are not welcome"" is totally untrue. The virus is not welcome but it's inevitable that it'll reach our islands sooner rather than later."
"Thank you. It’s on that St. John Peeps Facebook page. Several people have told others not to come and basically called them selfish for still coming. We are set to travel there in ten days and have been so excited. We are young and healthy and take precautions when flying as best we can. It would be a real bummer to have our trip cancelled. We are kinda just waiting and hoping that no flights are cancelled etc. I figured tourism supports the economy but I guess I somehow didn’t even think people may not want us there (oblivious and caught up in my vacation). When I thought about, I wouldn’t want to be there if people really want no visitors."
"Briana i'm so sorry you have to contend with this regarding your wedding!I truly hope things work out for you and your fiance. Since you can't change things all you can do is Chuck it in the you know what bucket and hope somehow it all works itself out. With a month to go perhaps things will be more in hand.Since technically you are still traveling to a US destination why does your family have to quarantine upon return?Edited: 12:07 pm, March 13, 2020 "
Thank you for all the info. I too saw the negativity towards tourism on the STJ FB group. We’re supposed to fly 3/24 and hoping we don’t have to cancel. Delta sent an email saying don’t call us unless your flight is within 72 hours so we have time to make the right decision
"I know this won’t be a popular opinion but honestly,, I don’t blame people on any of the USVI who don’t want people coming. People should not be traveling. The CDC has been clear that our biggest chance of changing the course of this virus is social distancing. As mainlanders in the U.S., we forget that these islands are small. They do not have the resources that we have here. I’m not saying the medical care isn’t good, but if say, St John has a widespread epidemic because of tourists coming in, that could overwhelm their health care resources. Then, the health care workers can get sick, etc etc. All you have to do is spend a little time reading stories online from Italy about what is happening in their health care system to understand what I’m saying. The Virgin Islands Dept of Health held a news conference this morning and stated they expect that the virus would be arriving to the USVI within the next 1-2 weeks. This is not a knock on anyone here at all, more of a statement about what the overall sentiment I am getting from people in the U.S. and that is... it’s all about what I want. Me, me, me...my vacation...my happiness. Let’s stop and give a thought to our fellow human beings."
"I agree to an extent. I don’t think it’s a matter of people only caring about their vacations and no one else. Some of us choose to believe that it is being somewhat over blown and hyped up while others choose to buy all of the toilet paper, dog food and sanitizer so no one else can buy as they regularly do. There seems to be no happy medium and by insinuating Americans only care about their vacations , it sure will be the unpopular opinion."
"I meant to say people in the states.. not AmericansEdited: 1:25 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Sadly just cancelled our planned trip scheduled for April 7th. Our villa owner was very gracious— I did not ask for a refund, I asked if we could reschedule at a later date. It comes down to this: all medical professionals- CDC, NIH, etc— are urging social distancing as the only way to stem the growth of this virus which is so deadly to a vulnerable population. Given the lack of testing, many of us may already be infected and never know it because many healthy individuals may remain asymptomatic. It just felt like the right thing to do was to postpone. St. John will still be there when this is all over and we will have a glorious vacation without the stress of all this hanging over our heads."
"Nicole: I agree with you about there being no happy medium. In regards to people in the States and for that matter, everyone in the world, being more concerned about their vacations than containing this very real pandemic, that is based on what I’ve heard, read, and observed. May be unpopular, but doesn’t make it less true. I’m truly glad your experience has been different.Edited: 1:30 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"My heart goes out to all of you who are scheduled to leave in a matter of days or weeks. And to the poor girl who is suppose to get married (Briana I think), I hope everything works out. Hopefully the wedding planner will give in and something can be worked out. Try to remember it's getting married that counts, not the location. I know it's hard to look at it that way right now. Let all of us on this thread know how things turn out please. We have two months before our vacation on the island. I know I have some time, but I am worried. I too have thought aboutme or my family being exposed at the airport, on the island, or not being able to get home. On top of vacaation concerns, my daughter graduates at the end of May and I'm hoping there is still going to be a prom in April and a graduation ceremony in May. We are embarkinig on a lot of uncertainty and we have to take things one day at a time. The most important thing is keeping ourselves, our families, our communities, and our nation safe. Stay safe everyone, and I hope all of you have toilet paper!Edited: 2:29 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Well said Onvacay! At least you have a little time to see how things go. I wish you the best!We just cancelled. Were due to fly out on Sunday.Our villa hosts were very gracious also, allowing us to re-book for a future date. So thankful there are such good people in the world.Now that I'm done feeling sorry for myself I need to go get more toilet paper. Didn't think I'd be needing it here for the next two weeks."
Updates and closings from the Governor's address today:https:/…
"Linda, I'm sorry you had to cancel. I'm glad your villa owner was understanding. I want to believe all of the owners and managers will be gracious and understanding during this time of uncertainty. Honestly, I can't imagine owners really want run the risk of having sick or quarantined people on their property either, or people stuck there due to flight cancelations. It's a tough situation for everyone. Good luck finding toilet paper, it seems to be all gone in Texas! I'm hearing food is disappearing as well. My motto.... this too shall pass!"
"We too are from Ohio and traveling to STJ on April 3rd. I'm a teacher and have spent the past two days getting materials ready for my students. They will come on Monday to get their materials, then I won't see them again until April 13th. I will miss their little faces (I teach 2nd grade). We too are waiting to see if our flights will be cancelled. We also will lose all money that we paid for our condo. I'm upset that we don't have the option to rebook. I'm not looking for a refund. Would just like to pick a different week. I really think this is taking advantage of the current situation!"
"I think it's more than a little premature to assume that vacation property owners won't be either giving refunds or offering a future booking. This is new territory and although the initial reaction of many was to adhere to their contracts, it's most likely that depending on how this pans out, that will change (and some owners have already decided to offer refunds/future bookings)."
"I've already been in contact with the owners and they have told us no. We are staying at a place in Grande Bay, and for some reason many of the owners there will not work with people on this. I know other people that are staying in a unit there too and are being told the same thing. I don't expect a refund, but in this situation, I would think they should let us pick a different week!"
"You might keep asking. Some places got a bad name after the hurricanes for poor customer service so hopefully, folks will do the right thing in the end. I wouldn't hesitate to reach out again, because I have heard several stories of owners refunding/rebooking.I am hoping for the same for our April BVI trip."
We were planning a trip in 3 weeks to the VI’s and BVI’s and have now postponed. It is our understanding from some reliable sources that testing is still very limited in the islands. The fact that there are no reported cases is likely a false sense of security. There has also been very limited screening available as STT. Some resorts are cancelling all events and discouraging new reservations for the time being. We chose to defer paradise for the time being. All the folks we worked with allowed us to credit deposits and full payments for future travel

"We’re 31 days out! Still maintaining hope we’re able to travel without a hitch. 4 adults all under 40 and 3 kids under 10. As we’re staying in a villa with a pool, we had already planned on socially distancing ourselves! I guess air travel is the only thing that makes me a little anxious. I’ve contacted our villa owner and we are able to rebook within a year, so I’m thankful to have that option! I’m going to make a last minute decision, so I can see how this all pans out. Fingers crossed!!!"
Deborah C. We are also booked at Grand Bay for the first week of a two week trip in Mid April. We booked thru a villa rental company . I am wondering if you booked directly with the owner. A few days ago I alerted the villa company that we rented a villa thru for week two that we were considering cancelling and she said to wait a few more weeks before deciding . She also said it would be up to the owner if we got a refund or were allowed to rebook. This is not the same company that we rented Grand Bay thru. So I am wondering if decisions about refunds or rebooking are completely out of the hands of the villa agencies
"I have to say, I'm pretty surprised by the blase attitude I'm seeing throughout this thread. Lots of heads in the sand. Some are surprising, some not so much. C'mon, guys. Entire countries don't shut down over the flu, so please stop comparing this to the flu. It hasn't even begun to run its full course yet. It's real, and very serious.Edited: 12:58 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"As someone who was scanning this dialogue for a while and painstakingly weighing our options, I wanted to share that we ultimately decided that best decision for ourselves and those we might come back to was to cancel our trip (which was scheduled to depart JFK on Sunday am). Whether it's an over abundance of caution or will prove to be the right move remains to be seen, but we didn't feel that even if we never experienced any health issues that we wouldn't be able to truly relax and enjoy the trip, which at the end of the day was the whole point.Best of luck to all who are weighing this out and struggling (as we did) with what is right for them. -Ben"
"Like Ben, I decided to cancel my trip that was scheduled to leave this morning. I made the decision on Thursday. I was concerned about possible health consequences for me of going through three airports. Concerned about getting stuck and unable to return. Concerned that I wouldn’t be able to relax and enjoy while this is going on. And concerned about possibly contributing myself to the spread of this disease. People can spread it before (or without ever) becoming aware that they have it. I would like nothing more than for this to be a Chicken Little moment. But as the director of the Ohio Department of Health said, you’re a Chicken Little and doing too much at the beginning, and you didn’t do enough at the end. This is a situation which requires collective action now to avoid catastrophic consequences later. And it’s going to produce a lot of pain - physical, psychic, and economic - before it ends."
"Definitely the right call, AAT. The only way to get a grip on this thing is if everyone does their own part without being forced. It has to be slowed down, there are not enough hospital beds, ventilators etc to care for a mass infection. That's why Italy is in the shape they are. Slow it down enough, and it'll be manageable. We currently have no idea how many infected there actually are, because we have done basically no testing yet. All indications are that it's everywhere now. The US has done something like 16k tests, total. Think about that."

"That is really unfortunate. The great guy I rented from gave us an extension on ability to cancel due to my husbands health issues. We had to cancel and he gave us a full refund. Maybe your story will make the rounds and the owners will figure out that maybe their decision wasn’t in anyone’s best interest.Edited: 3:04 pm, March 14, 2020 "

"We cancelled our trip that was scheduled for mid-April. Not because we are worried about getting sick, our family is low-risk, but we don't want to be part of the problem in spreading the virus. It just felt like the right thing to do. Our villa owner was extremely gracious and gave us a refund since we were unable to re-book anytime soon. It is nice to know that people are willing to be reasonable under extenuating circumstances. I am, however completely mystified by the whole toilet paper hoarding thing...??"
"We are flying into St. Thomas on March 17th from Florida assuming domestic travel is not restricted. We are very concerned about the speed of changes that are being put into place regarding travel restrictions due to the virus. I have never seen anything in my lifetime like this situation with restrictions. We had H1N1 in 2009 with 60 million cases in the US and 12,000 deaths. Did travel get restricted with flights, cruise lines, Disney World shutting down and large events being cancelled? https:/…2009-h1n1-pandemic.html"
how is customs at St Thomas are many people being quarantined from ny usa?
Kims....no!
"PatrickMcc...A while ago someone told me if I book through VRBO that I should contact the owners and book with them directly, to avoid the fees. So that is what I did this time. If flights get cancelled, and it's out of my hands, I'm hoping they'll do the right thing and let us book for a different week, but I'm not holding my breath."
"I was grateful to be told by our Grande Bay villa owner today that, were we not able to come in late April, that we would be fully refunded. I didn’t expect that, but did hope to reschedule for another time, if necessary. Kindness like that will certainly be remembered for our next trips and when making recommendations to friends."
"Like a lot of people here we decided travelling in 2 weeks wan't worth the risk of unforeseen consequences and inability to unwind and enjoy ourselves. Not to mention we all have a role in ensuring this virus doesn't spread by staying home.My recommendation to anyone with apprehension is to call your villa owner. They're people too, and are concerned about the state of the pandemic. My villa owner couldn't have been more understanding and willing to accommodate us later this year when this mess hopefully blows over. All it took was a phone call to work it out. People on St. John are some of the kindest you'll encounter, and they're worried, too."
"Just FYII have contacted three other owners and two mgmt companies yesterday and Saturday. Mgmt companies are suppose to meet at Sunday at Mongoose and effectively reach a mutual decision how to handle cancellations, rescheduling and yes refunds. Individual owners I talked wirh are taking various approaches from absolutely no rescheduling or refunds to immediate refunds, to rescheduling later this year at no guest cost. I, like many owners are working directly with guests to resolve things on an individual basis while trying to maximum mutual satisfaction of the outcome for all involved parties. Regardless this will have a serious negative financial impact on local employment involved with all phases of guest accommodations."
"I know it really really sucks to look forward to you vacation for months, or years, only to have to cancel it. But looking around the world and seeing what is going on in places that had outbreaks prior to the US, and what is going on there, I am having a hard time wrapping my head around why anyone would travel at this point. It seems like the best thing we can all do at this point is sit tight and try to reduce the spread of the virus in any way we can. As it is right now, we are going to need a lot of outside help to handle just our residents healthcare when the virus spreads. For anyone who does visit, please don't be upset or surprised if some locals 'social distance' with you in a way you have never seen before. We have a large elderly population and many households that are multi generational."
"GoPlaces, thank you for your response. Just so you know... trip insurers are generally NOT covering this pandemic. Even people with ""cancel for any reason"" insurance (which most people don't purchase due to the cost) doesn't refund at 100%. People are trying to do what their government requests them to do (stay home, not travel)."
"Good Morning! After a long day of traveling, we are finally arrived in Saint John. The Atlanta airport and Delta have taken many precautions in keeping everything clean. People were cleaning their seats and trays down with Clorox wipes. Some people wore masks, but for the most part there wasn’t the mass hysteria and panic that I was feeling when we left. We went back and forth on cancelling, but ultimately decided to come. We could stay back and I think our chances may be greater in getting this virus. Maybe, that’s wishful thinking. I know severity of this virus, however, we are doing everything possible to stay healthy and I don’t want to give into fear. I am also the thinking the window of opportunity to travel will grow smaller within the coming weeks. I hope this helps!"

"Angela; it shouldn't be about YOUR chances of catching the virus while on vacation, but the chances that YOU could bring it with you, spreading infection to an area very ill prepared to deal with it. People should not be taking vacations right now. Full stop."

Well nobody should ever use Hotels.com!! I just cancelled our room for our trip to St John because we didn't want to contribute to the spread of the virus and now they won't refund any of our money because we didn't cancel by February 27th! When I call their customer service number they say they are experiencing technical difficulties and can't answer. When I go online they say all agents and busy and to try back later. What a big scam!! So upset right now that I had to cancel my trip in the first place - and now we can't get a refund either!!
"Booked for May here so got some time to see what happens but I contacted our villa owner. He’s a well reviewed and respected owner in Coral Bay with whom we booked directly. He assured us we would be able to reschedule no problem...”anything I can do to make you happy” he said. Glad we did our research and hope the majority of the other owners follow suit. Who knows, maybe they will generate life-long repeat customers depending on how this is handled when all said and done. Good luck and good health to everyone, vacationers and locals! Hope to see you soon!!!"
"It’s appalling to see some people still contemplating what is the correct answer.This thinking of I, Me , Myself is what will make this once in a lifetime event a catastrophe. STAY HOME!!"
Timmy and VRYou are both correct! The elderly and residents need to be protected. I tried to post on St John's source and they wouldn't let me express my view that the tourists should not come for a while. We must Pray and try to help each other and think of each other.

"I see lots of messages being removed. I honestly think everyone should stay home. We are so Devastated from the storms And our economy is hurting. But this is so much bigger than any single one of us. I would just stayed put and we all said ‘this was no big deal’. That would be a job well done.Edited: 5:28 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"The good news - if any - is that this won't require reconstruction and rebuilding of infrastructure to come back from.When the demand comes back, the capacity to fill it should be there."
"I see both sides, there is no right answer and I don’t think you should feel bad about whatever option you choose.....you are definitely not going to get the cold shoulder on St. John, it’s business as usual right now."
I disagree TournesolSJ.
"And the recovery rate of those worldwide who've contracted the virus is 92% as of today. Down from 93% yesterday because of the very unusually high death rate in Italy.If you decide to cancel your plans that's up to you. If you decide to go ahead with your plans, ditto. Expressing an opinion is one thing, berating people who decide not to change their plans and accusing them of being selfish out of a desire to ""help the residents and particularly the elderly"" is another and in my opinion uncalled for. The virus is already in the territory and will no doubt affect several people just as other viruses have done and will continue to do.Oh and by the way, just to put things in perspective, I'm 74 years old. If my immune system were compromised I'd self-quarantine and absolutely not travel anywhere - and many friends in my age group who live here feel exactly the same."
"well said, sttres!"
"Looking back to 2009 when we gladly boarded a cruise ship for our honeymoon during the swine flu crisis and I am stuck scratching my head now. There was nothing on the news to tell us to stay home, we hardly even knew it was a thing. Now everyone is making sure you have enough TP to wipe your backside because no one will be making more tomorrow. Its hard as our cruise was supposed to port in Antigua and St. Lucia but we were denied because a crew member didn't feel well. We ended up in St Thomas / St. John as a last minute addition. No one batted an eye back then as to travelling or going to the USVI. We all lived through it, maybe it was selfish?Fast forward 11 years, the sky is falling and it won't ever get better for years if you believe the media. The UK is saying anyone over 60 will have to self quarantine for 4 months.  Well at that rate I may as well go out happy right? I have friends all over the world in areas that are heavily infected living their lives like normal or as close to as they can. What is real, what is fake news? The folks who are business owners on STT I have talked with the past few days don't seem all that concerned and were reassuring me to continue my trip if I felt comfortable. At this point its up to the airline and the government, but I am not sure what I will ultimately choose.Calling people names on the internet is so 1996."
St. John Julie I deleted two of my messages because. I responded to a complaint about a villa owner without waiting to get both sides of the story.. Now I have it. Both the renter and the villa owner prefer to keep this private so I will respect their decision.
"Gd1147. No need to believe the media. Believe the head of the CDC, believe the doctors and scientists, believe VP Mike Pence and the. Experts who surrounded him at the news conference on TV tonight. Yes they are on the media but they are not the media. This is not the swine flu. It is not a flu according to the CDC it is different and more dangerous.,"
"When entire countries are shutting down, talking about limiting even domestic travel... it's serious. STT, you're really minimizing something that you don't have any knowledge of. Do you think the islands are ready to deal with an outbreak? 10-20% of those infected need to be hospitalized, are there enough beds and ventilators for that? I get the desire to limit panic, and not adversely impact the local economy, I do. But this is a lot bigger than that. Your minimizations are dangerous. Listen to medical professionals who are saying to stay home, and cancel all non essential travel. Fauci even said he wouldn't go to a restaurant. Come on."
People are getting really hostile and nasty on this post. If you’ve already rescheduled your trip and don’t have questions why are you still replying? Everyone’s entitled to their own opinions. The name calling etc is lame. Go do a puzzle or something. Some of you really need hobbies that don’t include cyber bullying.
If you want a crystal ball to see America or the Caribbean ten days in the future... look at Italy.
"My daughter works at the CDC on this. She just texted to confirm I am no longer going to my office 30 miles away and will work remotely. she is not a fear monger, but understands that some people are carriers and infect others unknowingly, and for those of us of a certain age, or compromised in some way, this can be dangerous very quickly. We are in a crisis. I would not enjoy a trip right now knowing I could be spreading the disease to others, or that one of us could be infected far from home. We don't know what we don't know. A friend is a dr in Milan - on the front lines. It is frightening. Time to hunker down and pray. St John will still be there. Let's help them be as healthy as possible."
"Timmaaayyy- (LOVE your handle, Btw! ;) ) Just wanted time let you know that the hospital on St Thomas is outstanding. In fact, when we purchased our estate, i looked into it specifically because my husband is a heart patient. I have no hesitation at all entrusting the health of my family to their care.Hope everyone stays safe, healthy and well and hope your trips work out well for each of you. God bless!"
"They may be outstanding, I am not disputing that. But the fact is, there are not nearly enough beds, much less respirators. Pleasure trips should be canceled, full stop. Do they have a pandemic mode? I highly doubt it. I'm shocked this is even in dispute at this stage. Denial is a powerful thing.I have no illusions about this, some people can't be reached and will do what they want. That is exactly what will keep us from containing this thing, to say nothing about the govt straight up lying repeatedly. Then there is Fox, which should be burnt to the ground after all that they have done to directly add to the pandemic by denying, minimizing, and obfuscating the truth. They're still doing it.Edited: 11:37 am, March 17, 2020 "
This needs deleted
"stop the preaching. People can / should make their own decisions.And agree this needs to be deleted, it is no longer at all helpful and way outside of normsEdited: 10:34 am, March 16, 2020 "
"TIMMMAAY, yes the hospital does have a ""pandemic mode"" and is prepared. That said, enough is enough. You have an opinion and have expressed it to the max. Not everybody, visitors or locals, agrees with you. This is not the forum to berate those who disagree with you. You pay attention to your own backyard and we'll deal with ours. Thank you."
"I disagree. It is everyone's responsibility to try to get people to see how serious this is. Too many people are still displaying a totally callous attitude right now, which just mystifies me. Your opinion is of no more value than mine. I highly doubt that the hospital on St Thomas has a pandemic mode. Most stateside hospitals don't even have that. It's a recent thing, slow to be adopted. Do you know what it means for a hospital to have a pandemic mode? It isn't just some shift in duties or priorities. It involves airlocks, negative air pressure, sealed entrances, and much more."
"""I highly doubt that the hospital on St Thomas has a pandemic mode.""No doubt this won't satisfy you but I'll submit it just the same simply to counteract your assertion.https://viconsortium.com/vi-coronavirus/virg…"

"Well, it's not a full pandemic mode, but better than I expected. But it also proves a large part of my point here. There are not nearly enough beds. Six rooms. Six. I'm not trying to have a personal dispute with you here. If you think that having six treatment rooms available is sufficient, I'm not sure what else to say."

Amen. Take care of yourself.
"I guess the whole need to ""flatten the curve"" hasn't really disseminated widely enough yet.This issue is not really one of total cases over time, but how quickly those cases come, where they are, and when they peak.Overall, It might not be so bad if any given island/town/country has 1,000 total cases THIS YEAR, with 100 of them being severe.

"From a Facebook user:Just finished listening to the VI Governors Covid-19 Briefing, aided by the Dept of Education, Dept of Health, Congressional Rep Stacy Plaskett, and all kinds of other professional input. Bottom line: NO curfew. OK to travel between USVI and BVI. NO closing of ferries or barges between St John and St Thomas (they recognize it as essential.) NO shortage of food or necessary medical supplies/pharmaceuticals. They requested extra ventilators and each hospital has 40 single-use ventilators (plus 7 regular ventilators with resources and authorization to fly patients off-island for additional needs.) USVI can test but still need to send tests to CDC or mainland labs for results but that is anticipated to be able to be done in VI in the near future. Every single speaker (and there were MANY) emphasized good and close communication and cooperation with federal government including the President and Vice President with whom they had extended conversation this morning. (And please don't attack me if you hate them because I am just conveying what was said.) They anticipate airport staying open unless FAA closes down ALL U.S. airports which isn't anticipated to be done in near future."
Carnival cancelled. Use red hook ferry only for essential travel.
"<< ""Use red hook ferry only for essential travel."" >>Doesn't everyone believe that THEIR travel is essential?Will there be screeners asking why people are going and determine whether it's actually ""essential"" that they get there?"
"I think Nicole's Post and TournesolSJ are at odds over the use of the word essential. One says the Government recognizes the ferries as essential, the other says only use them for essential travel. I could see the people ferry wanting to keep social distancing as people are exposed to each other, hence only use it for essential travel. While the car barge you are pretty much socially distanced in your vehicle."
"I listened to the briefing and he said specifically the red hook ferry was for essential travel only. But obviously the meaning of “essential” is open to interpretation! And he did say something about limiting the number of people on the ferries, potentially 50 or less"
"What he actually did was ASK people to use the ferries only if it was essential. No mandate, a request. He said that right now they're working on possibly limiting the number of people allowed on any one ferry crossing."
"Thank you both for clarifying, that makes perfect sense with my interpretation."
Trying to figure out what to do? We are supposed to fly to St Thomas on March 30th. We are staying at an Air bnb for 5 days then we are taking a Catamaran with 3 other couples for a week. This is our 30 year anniversary! What some of your opinions? Thx in advance
I also have a trip booked for next week 3/23. Flight and hotel are still on! Are we crazy to go?
Don And Samantha. At his press conference yesterday Trump said not to travel. People over 60 have been warned not to travel for several weeks by the CDC. Cancel and hope your trip providers will do the right thing. Eight of us were scheduled for mid April and we will cancel. We are hoping for refunds but do not know yet.
"<< “What some of your opinions” >><< “Are we crazy to go?” >>To me, this is one of those “if you’re asking the question... you already know the answer” situations.My perspective: My wife and daughter are on a Caribbean island as I type this. They are flying back this morning... earlier than planned. When they flew down last week things sort of seemed to be an “Oh, that’s an ‘Italy’ problem” curiosity thing to us. That changed quickly... seemingly between the time their flight boarded in Newark and the time it landed in the Caribbean.Maybe we weren’t paying enough attention a week ago? Who knows. But, assuming that your TV and internet service is currently working, I hope you’re paying attention. If you’re thinking that this is “an Aruba problem” or “a Dominican Republic problem” or “a St Maarten problem” but that the Virgin Islands will duck the issue... you might want to pay closer attention.And by “problem” I don’t just me the virus. The reality is that you must also give as much weight — probably more — to “the panic” when deciding whether/how your trip will go.Edited: 8:35 am, March 17, 2020 "
My husband and our 5 children (14-21) are supposed to leave on 3/23 as well for 9 days. We have rented a house in a remote area. We also have a Catamaran Sea Turtle excursion planned. Been paying and planning the since last fall. Seems like it's a moral dilemma at this point.
There should be no dilemma. It should be a dead simple call; cancel.
"My wife and I have a trip planned to St. John starting on 3/22. We haven't officially canceled but plan to. One thing I have noticed is that both the St. John rental property owner and the rental car guy both seem almost completely unconcerned about the whole issue. I have been chatting with them letting them know we might cancel, and they just don't seem like they're worried about it. It's struck me as a little odd though they might just be concerned about the amount of business they're probably about to lose."
"nburgleton - have you discussed refunds with them and they have no problem with that?Edited: 9:40 am, March 17, 2020 "
"The rental car agency has only been given a deposit so far, and they said they would credit. I am going to speak with the rental property owner tomorrow, but no discussions with him have been had yet concerning refunds. Given the original contract was no cancellation, I'm not going into the discussion on very high ground. Unfortunately, credits won't do much for me, because I don't suspect to be able to replan this vacation for at least a year but more than likely two."
"What's the chatter around the island on how owners/mgmt companies will be treating this if/when there's a travel ban and we cannot get to the island even if we wanted to? I'm arriving on April 18th and feel like that scenario is more than possible. I've preliminary discussions with the property manager who said that the owners, as of now, will let you re-book for later in the year, but this might not be feasible, since the property is already booked for a lot of the rest of the year. We are dealing with something unprecedented here, and I cannot imagine owners will want to screw guests, since we can scream their names from the rooftops and keep them from getting future business, especially if some owners are giving refunds."
"I host airbnb occasionally and they are offering full refunds to hosts to cancel or if the guests cancel. Not sure that's helpful for direct rentals but if airbnb (who takes a ton of fees) is waiving all of that, I'd presume 'normal' folks will as well."
"This thread contains several positive reports by renters of flexible treatment by the owners. The one exception was a complaint that Grande Bay condo owners were taking a hard line. I alerted our villa company last week that we were considering cancelling because of the CDC guidelines about people over 60 not flying, she said wait a few weeks and see what happens and it would be up to the villa owner to decide. I am not sure how much authority the villa company has over refund decisions.  An earlier post by an island villa owner said the management companies were having a meeting last Sunday at Mongoose to decide what to do. I have seen nothing about this which leads me to believe they did not reach an agreement. The websites of the two villa companies that we used have no information about this. Given the increasing gravity of the situation, I cannot believe that renters will be held to the cancellation policies."
"Both of the folks I have spoken with make St. John sound like life is completely normal there other than fewer people than they would have this time of the year. I guess we'll all find out sooner or later. I'm not really a post someone's name all over the internet kind of person, especially since I signed a no-cancellation contract ahead of time. Some special consideration would be appreciated though.I think more annoying for me is that I never buy trip insurance, but switched to a Chase Sapphire card which has built in trip insurance...except for pandemic."
"Yes Patrick, as of now I'm not in the ""positive"" report camp for the property I'm staying at. Could just be they don't understand the gravity of the situation yet. I'll relax for now until we get closer."
"nburgleton, There is a ""no-cancellation"" contract for normal times, and then there is this.We are potentially going well beyond the looking glass soon. I cannot imagine a scenario where owners will call this business as usual. But if that happens, we'll cross that bridge then."
nburgleton - You never know. This is a totally different situation. I hope you are able to get a refund.
"<< ""I cannot believe that renters will be held to the cancellation policies."" >>Why? When renters signed the rental contract, didn't they do so with the expectation that the owners would abide by the terms? I understand that this is an emotional issue... always is when money is involved. The current situation amps that up further.So I guess I'm not surprised how one-sided people are being about this. This is a zero-sum game, folks. Renters expect to be fully protected from loss... with no consideration that what that means is they expect owners to fully accept a loss of the same amount of money.Yes, this situation is terrible. And, no, the renters had nothing to do with causing it. But neither do the owners.Hopefully, everyone can come to an agreement that is of least impact to all. As a friend who is a professional arbitrator always says ""If a settlement results in both parties being unhappy... it was probably a fair settlement."""
"We would be willing to rebook which I think is fair. I have read on this thread that several owners have refunded without any problem. That, to me, is generous."
"post 190: it is generous, and those owners who do the right thing should be commended, and acknowledged for it. Karma takes notes (or I like to believe that)."
"New Jersey - what's happening now is an Act of God. This isn't business as usual stuff. It's not like if I can't go use my villa, there are 1,000s lined up to take my place. There will be no tourism on St John if we have a travel ban. At all"

"Unfortunately, so far we have found none of the parties involved are ""doing the right thing."" We are scheduled 3/21-3/28. The Westin Villas has been paid in full and denies any responsibility for refund or postponement. Its timeshare owner (idenity unknown), who put his/her week of timeshare up through Vacation Candy (web vendor of timeshares) is silent. Vacation Candy claims that its up to the timeshare owner and denies any responsibility for good corporate citizenship and suggests we deal with the villa owner, who's name they wont divulge. Chase Sapphire Preferred claims the ""pandemic is an exclusion to coverage."" We also bought travel insurance in October for the full trip cost. The insurer asserts that ""fear of travel"" leading to trip cancellation is not a covered event. We plan on cancelling...and taking the financial hit because its :doing the right thing."" So far, we're not seeing that from anyone else...."
"Just to clarify since this was posted on a St John forum, the VI Carnival is that held on St Thomas culminating the last week of April - not the St John carnival which takes place around July 4th."
Just fear mongering by TIMMMAAY. Way past any kind of helpful info. Really a shame that people have to get to this point.
"Yes, we have two cases of Coronavirus in the USVI and are awaiting test results on other POIs. Nine more tests were sent to the CDC yesterday 3/16. Schools are closing tomorrow and all cruise ship visits are cancelled. Carnival has been postponed indefinitely."
"Per Lime Out's Facebook page, they are closing for the next two weeks."
"Yes, we have two confirmed cases of Coronavirus 1 STT and 1 STX) and are awaiting results of more. Nine additional tests of POI were sent to the CDC yesterday. The schools are closing tomorrow, cruise ship visits suspended, and Carnival has been postponed indefinitely. If you are elderly or have underlying medical issues you probably shouldn’t be on an airplane. Otherwise it is 82 and Sunny with crystal clear waters!"

"I have read every comment on this post because I too have been in a dilemma. This was going to be my first trip, booked for the first week in June. I have been crushed at the thought of possibly having to cancel. I understand everyone's concerns. I know everyone says being trapped in paradise would be great. All kidding aside, I don't think any of us would be ok trapped on an island with coronavirus, nor would we want to bring the virus to the island. None of us has any idea what would happen if someone on the island got sick while we were there. We have no idea how the local government would respond. What if they shut down the ferry and locked down the island? Supplies and food would be gone in the blink of an eye. And let's be real here, the hospitals on the mainland are worried what will happen if the masses start flooding in, so how on earth can any of us assume the hospital on St. Thomas could treat the masses. I could not live with the guilt if I got sick or one of my kids got sick. I think all of us are posting because we are all hoping for a miracle, but we know in our guts this isn't going to magically go away in a matter of a few days or a couple of weeks. If I decided to take the risk and go, with things how they are right now, I would worry myself silly wondering if one of us got exposed or if we could get home, and that equals a disappointing and ruined vacation. We have been asked to limit travel and to practice social distancing. If we don't, it's a matter of time before the government puts us all in isolation. I don't think any of us wants that. Taking a vacation right now is not doing our part in tryinig to keep this virus at bay here in the US. Some of you are fortunate enough to be able to take expensive vacations all the time, and some of you have to save and sacrifie to take a vacation. I fall into the group of saving and sacfricing. Regardless of which category you fall into, dealing with an owner/manager who refuses to work with you is upsetting, and in my opinion is pretty piss poor and bad business. But all of us has to put on our big girl/boy panties and be adults here. If we get on a plane right now, with all the uncertainty and what if's, we are putting our lives and the lives of our spouces, children, parents, friends, and strangers in danger. This isn't make believe. it's real, and it's going to affect all of us in some way. It sucks having to cancel trips all of us on here have been planning and looking forward to. It sucks that some owners/managers refuse to work with us. But it would really suck if one of us on this forum ended up with this virus as a result of taking these trips. I'm still living in the world of make believe, hoping for a miracle within the next month. But I know without a doubt that when the time comes I will put on my big girl panties and be a resppnsible adult and cancel if the miracle doesn't come. Since I'm on a roll, I also want to suggest to those of you contacting owners and property managers to be considerate of what they are going through as well. Be kind, patient, understanding, and don't make it all about you. If you are on the defensive, they will be too. All of us are navigating uncharterd waters right now. Being an adult and making tough decisions is not all it's cracked up to be. I hope all of you are able to work something out with the villa owners/property managers, jeep rentals, and airlines. Here's to social distancing and not being a toilet paper hoarder!"
"I would love to be in St. John right now. While I have no symptoms, I have been out in public places recently so I'm doing everyone a favor and staying put. People who often don't know they have the virus for 5 to 10 days spread it. Get mad and stamp your feet if you want to. I think everyone should stay where they are. If the people in St. John want what's going on here right now to come there, get ready for it."
"I wouldn’t cancel a trip in June, in fact I’m considering rebooking mine for June."
"I can be quoted a week ago on my hometown (nyc) forum responding to someone’s “how is travel being impacted in the city now” question saying “business as usual” — boy do I feel silly now! I wasn’t even advising to or not to travel, simply stating the facts that it wasn’t affecting anything in my part of the city yet except for water-cooler chatter. Now we all on the forum share a very strong DO NOT COME stance. If we had understood anything about the next few days, we would have started discouraging the travelers earlier. Feels like a little “too little, to late” for here— but there’s a chance for that NOT to be the case in the VIs. Hence, the push for social responsibility. There is zero reason for anyone to get in a plane for pleasure travel at this point for the next couple weeks. It’s not a matter of putting yourself at risk, it’s a matter of the mob risk. Sure you can isolate easily on the island. But to get to your place of isolation there is so much risk of expoSURE and expoSING. It’s bewildering to watch the people not taking it seriously as it just hasn’t gotten to them yet. The fundamental basis for the isolation though, is to *try* to ensure that that doesn’t happen— that it doesn’t ever get to them. It’s not much but it’s all we can do. I get the mentality, and as an nyc resident, I’ve certainly said I’d be safer on the island than I am at home. I, too, am hesitant to cancel my trip in early May. I, too, want to see how things play out. But, I’m ready to pull out when the time comes. Mentally we’re treating it as a trip that’s not going to happen , but still waiting it out ... partly because I just want to hope that this madness will end. Partly because the airlines are overwhelmed right now anyway. It seems so far away in a world where we’re not even totally sure if we’ll still have jobs in a month if we’ve gone into total lockdown, so ....for us we just can’t look that far ahead yet. A month seems like a lifetime. But take it from New York: that it was business as usual yesterday has no bearing on whether it will be business as usual tomorrow.(Hah, also — sorry to the OP who came and went pleasantly within the safety window that it has to be your post that keeps going! But still a worthwhile continuing conversation)"
"Nicole, I have not canceled, but I have to come to terms with the fact that there's a good chance I will have to."
"I agree completely AMS! One day your city or community appears fine, the next, it's shut down. In a nutshell, anyone vacationing right now is part of the problem, exposure and exposing."
"We were due to arrive 3/25 for nine days. Being an older couple, late 60's early 70's, we decided it wasn't worth the risk even though neither of us are showing any signs of illness or have any underlying issues. We have talked to our condo rep at Lavender Hills Suites and they are going to cancel our reservations and let us rebook in the future NC. We thank that is great as we definitely want to visit St. John in the future when this is all behind us! Just wanted to let everyone know some of the owners are doing the right thing! Our sincere Thanks to Brian at LHS!"
"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-co…This is the actual report that spurred the change in US govt messaging in the past several days, and the UK as well."
"<< ""One day your city or community appears fine, the next, it's shut down."" >>My perspective: My wife and daughter are on a flight home from the DR as I type this. They left Punta Cana this morning... returning earlier than planned. When they flew down last week things sort of seemed to be an “Oh, that’s an ‘Italy’ problem” curiosity thing to us. That changed quickly... seemingly between the time their flight boarded in Newark and the time it landed in the Caribbean.Less than one week ago we were on the fence about whether to go or cancel. Since that time the world went from ""Ah... what the heck!"" to ""Yo... what the f**k!""Can't wait to see what NEXT WEEK looks like.:-0"
Congratulations on getting your family home! I bet that's a relief.
"I was scheduled to fly to STX on 3/14 and agonized over it quite a bit. First my husband had to drop out because of work related to the virus. Then I pretty much talked myself into going alone because we would lose about $2200. Then about last Thursday night I realized I was kidding myself if I thought going through an airport right now to get to a beach was a good idea for my own or the WORLD's health.I wish my rental owner would have offered some accommodation, but she did not (and we stayed with her last year, so sort of feel like we know her). Also, I purchased trip insurance AND have Chase Sapphire coverage - both of which are not covered in this situation.For those of you accusing people such as TIMMMAAAY of being alarmist, I would be interested to hear what you'll be saying in a week or two.Ohio is a state that is taking aggressive measures to try to stop this. Our director of Health Dept. put it well when she said you're always accused of doing too much at the beginning of something like this, and of having not done enough at the end.BTW, a 48-year-old in my very small town was one of the first cases in Ohio and was hospitalized for several days last week. No known reason why she caught it (community spread). She very likely shops at the same grocery store as me. Aren't you all glad I didn't travel through three airports last week and sit at the local establishments on STX handing around money and credit cards? (I have a slight cough right now, that I'm REALLY hoping is the start of seasonal allergies!)Be well, USVI."
"RJP-NJ happy to hear your family is coming back safe. The DR is beautiful, but not a place I would want to be stuck.For my own plans it is just unrealistic to think travelling right now is a good idea. Both my condo owner and rental car company have said there would be no problem to cancel / get a refund. While I could reschedule for later in the spring / early summer, I seriously don't think this will be behind us fully by then. I am cautiously optimistic we will be back next winter/spring."
"Sorry if this has been addressed recently in the thread, but I’m in a time crunch and want to post on behalf of my sister who is on the island with her young children. She is currently scheduled to head back to Boston on the 24th. Is there anyone on the ground now or has a clear understanding of any upcoming restrictions in terms of flights? Does the island have any plans to lock down air travel or implement a shelter in place? Equally important, are any airlines looking at reducing or eliminating flights to and from St Johns? Basically want to understand what is known about the current environment there and is the consensus is that her flights out will hold in the near term. I just had a pretty hectic experience getting out of the Galápagos Islands with one days notice from the government before they closed the border and it was a difficult and extremely expensive problem to navigate. Thanks for the help"
"Is your sister on Antigua where St Johns is located or on St John, US Virgin Islands? There's no airport on St John, all flights are out of St Thomas. If on St John USVI and flying out of St Thomas, nothing has been said about curtailing flights, nor any restrictions."
"Just spoke to a few folks on island that confirmed that many (not all) cruz bay restaurants will be closing dining rooms for 2 weeks. Some will still offer take out but some will close completely. This includes Banana Deck, 1864, The Terrace (they will evaluate in a week) Xtra Virgin, Lime Inn. Skinnies already announced. Thinking they likely all will in some way but there will be a few that act a a hub, like Cruz Bay landing, similar to Irma/Maria.They are expecting the Governor to mandate and getting just getting ahead. I think News of St John is starting an open / closed list."
"Sorry yes, the St. John’s in USVI...understand she needs to take the ferry to Thomas so question is related to air travel from there."
"That doesn't seem fair. No one wants to cancel and we all wish we could travel to St John and support the restaurant owners, tour guides etc during this time of chaos however we are being told to cancel to avoid possibly bringing the virus to the island.We were supposed to go to Grande Bay on April 1 and our owners have graciously allowed us to reschedule to a future date. I am so grateful and will certainly refer friends to them . I don't understand why your owner is not doing the same. We are not asking for refunds and want nothing more than to be able to visit this beautiful island. I hate to say it but there are many ways including social media to get the word out about a particular owner unwilling to allow you to reschedule. I hope they change their mind in the coming days..... Good Luck"
"Ryan G, the confusion arose because there's no ""s"" on the St John here! Anyway, think I answered your question and she'll certainly hear should there be any changes to flights. People have been coming and going with no problem the last several days."
Soundtrader who gave you this information ?
"BigMikey65 I am seeing these closures pop up on Facebook feeds. It looks like it is just a matter of time that things are in place to restrict gathering in groups of 10 or more like they are stateside.Edited: 8:57 pm, March 17, 2020 "
Ok thanks...I have been out and about here so it’s news to me.
Yeah I saw a FB post a few minutes ago. Skinny's closing for 2 weeks (min).
We are currently on STT and due to leave Thursday. We own our condo and we are on a beautiful beach with lots of friends. We have been struggling to decide to stay or go home There is probably less risk of contracting the virus here butIf you do the treatment options are not good. I believe I read in the Daily News that the hospital has a total of 6 rooms devoted for treatment. Being in a crowded airport and plane aren’t great options and are high risk. The vi had had a few confirmed cases in the last few days I know that there have been many reservations cancelled. We have decided to go home after struggling with the decision Each will have to weigh the various factors and decide for themselves.
"I'm just gonna put this out there...everyone please do your part to listen to the experts and hunker down. I work in healthcare and have around 280 senior citizens in my care that I'm trying to keep safe. Right now I'm struggling with not having enough supplies to protect my staff who devote themselves to the vulnerable population they serve. It doesn't matter that I had to cancel my plans to come to STJ, even though that was all I could think about...what matters is we all pitch in however we can to slow this virus down and get beyond this."
"Onvacay1, thank you. That was an excellent post!"
"Thank you stjohnjulie! Things are tough right now for planet earth. I'm very fortunate, the owners of the villa I rented have offered me a full refund or I can change dates, whichever works best for me. As long as they have no intentions to try to rent the villa if I cancel, I want to hang on a little longer and see what happens. My heart isn't ready to let go of my paradise vacation just yet, although my brain is telling me i'ts probably not gonna happen. This was going to be my daughter's graduation trip (technically just a vacation, but she likes to refer to it as her graduaton trip since we are suppose to leave a week after she graduates), now we don't know if there will be prom or graduation. Our county fair was canceled last night. I'm trying to count my blessings and remind her of her blessings as well. Things could be worse.Edited: 3:08 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"We were to be at Westin next week also and booked thru Redweek.com... the didn't take any responsibility either, just my $5k with no refund and no make up dates."
Same problem and social media is my only resource. Dont like going negative but I dont like being ignored.
"rdatma1 did you call the Westin on STJ? Are they still open? You rented a timeshare week via Redweek, it's the middleman. If the week was from a timeshare owner they only own 1 week, they have no access to changing weeks done at such a late date. Not sure if even travel insurance would cover what's going on"
"I've read about two confirmed COVID 19 cases in the USVI, one on St. Croix, one in St. John/St. Thomas. By now there are surely more.We cancelled our trip. The US is warning against all non essential travel overseas. All of us should be staying home and practicing social distancing."
"James S, just to clarify, there are still three cases in the US Virgin Islands, all three mild cases with full recovery expected. Now that we do have some testing kits, some are in the hands of the CDC and results are awaited."
"<< ""James S, just to clarify, there are still three cases in the US Virgin Islands, all three mild cases with full recovery expected..."">>What sort of clarification does this provide? Do you really not see that your reply sort of subtly sounds like you're minimizing the information and/or suggesting that James may have overreacted by cancelling his trip?I know... I know... you're just reporting the facts as you see them.""The sun is shining, the birds are singing...""Edited: 5:01 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"RJP, obviously you're bound and intent to snarkily criticize every answer I give to every question and every comment I make.James S made the comment that there must be more cases by now and I simply said no, that the three already reported are the total for now."
"I’m stunned that this conversation is even still happening. They call St. John Love City for a reason. Maybe everyone who is not on the same page can agree to disagree, and we can all show each other some love during this unprecedented time."
United is now waiving change fees through May 31st.
"Just be very clear and careful if cancelling with United miles. The first time we called we were told we could cancel and use our waiver ""miles credit"" to fly until May 2021 and we should call when ready to book. If we actually wanted our miles downloaded back into our account it would cost $300. Of course, we said we'll take the waiver credit. The more I thought about it, I was really uncomfortable because I received no documentation that we had cancelled and had the ""credit"" . Received a ""confirmation"" that looked exactly like our first itinerary booking confirmation with NO mention of cancellation or credit waiver. Called back and it turned out the fact is you can fly for up to a year from date of ticket purchase (which is stated on their site about the current waivers), but we were going by information we both heard on phone call. In any case, we ended up paying $150 total to have the miles downloaded back in our account. Worth it! If we had not called back, we'd be out all those miles. I don't think this was done on purpose, just a lot going on for them and we received misinformation. We need to protect our own interests as much as we can."
Three more cases announced this evening
"kit_kat, you do realize that numbers will skyrocket only because we are testing more now. Having a low number initially when so few are tested does not mean it is not prevalent. Cases should skyrocket in the next week or two as people get tested. This will give us a much better ""n"" to go on and we will see mortality drop, which it has already started to do. Do not let the n alarm you, it should go up now."
"Kit_kat, I am on the front lines and really am not fazed by it that much. I think the numbers pale in comparison to other pandemics we have gone through that were more virulent with higher mortality. We will get through it. I wish we had enough PPE to go around though."
I wish all of the people berating people on this forum would put their efforts towards pushing the federal government to get more test kits and supplies and PPE for the medical workers. That is a huge fail. We should have been prepared for this.That would be a more useful exercise IMO.
"Saffie, sadly, we don’t make that stuff here anymore, people were stealing it from the hospitals and hoarding it for themselves, so our supplies are scarce. Hoping 3M can ramp up production in the US and get us some stuff!People are all out in masks which is crazy."
Heard just a minute ago on tv that 3M has doubled it's production since the beginning .
People stuck at home are starting to sew them. See link:https:/…
"I’m on the front lines too at a very busy ER and up close n personal with these suspected patients and we have 3 confirmed in our hospital at this point with many tests pending. To be honest, I’m pretty sure I had the virus already first week of March when I was out with the “flu”...before it was announced a pandemic. It’s been in our borders long before we just started testing people (and the testing is still a very slow process at this point). The problem we are all aware of is how it spreads so easily hence all the social distancing which WILL prove to be beneficial. We need to all do our part with hygiene and keeping our distance but we shouldn’t become hysterical about it. These people that are hoarding supplies are what’s the real issue here. We need PPE like snork said. If you want to do something to help then find all these Aholes that have gobbled up all the masks and give them to the people that NEED them. We’re the richest country in the world and soon we’ll be sending our soldiers to battle without a frickin helmet. Right now we have to make a mask last as long as we can throughout the day (that’s hygienic and not a great way to spread infection) and these are masks that are inadequate to begin with because the proper N95s are in very short supply. Another thing to think about is if you or a loved one must go to the emergency room for any other unrelated complication, we're not going to have a mask to give YOU. So if you didn’t have covid when you arrived, ya might have it before you leave.We go on lock down here in NY tonight so nothing will be open but grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations and liquor stores (thank god), restaurants for take out. We’ll beat this for sure but how long it takes to get worse before it gets better is still unknown. Holding on to our reservation for May still at this point but we’ve come to grips with the fact that’s probably not happening. We can reschedule with our villa owner, in fact he’d probably give us a refund too but we’d much rather reschedule. Go America!Edited: 10:07 am, March 21, 2020 "
"It's been very interesting and eye-opening reading all these posts from early Feb to today...the comments/reactions/emotions could definitely be part of a human psychological study. It started like a small seemingly simple little wave churning out at sea and became....?These are certainly confusing, uneasy times. Peace to everyone."
In NY they are apparently essential businesses. Where I live the local liquor store did three times their normal weekly business the day the WHO declared a pandemic.
They don’t want the alcoholics looting...or invading homes. I heard the dispensaries in Cali are open and deemed essential. I’d rather visit the weed store than the liquor store if I’m gonna quarantine.
"I thought the same thing Takereasy! If you want to stop civil unrest, legalize it. I’ve never met a belligerent stoner. In all seriousness, I was told that The liquor stores are open in NY, so the seriously dependent don’t withdrawal and burden the ER’s."
"Both St Croix and St Thomas have been placed on voluntary lockdown and no tourists may arrive. Hotels may not book rooms for 30 days, as of last week (March, 18,, 2020."
"Floyd in VI, this has already been reported upon but it's not true that ""no tourists may arrive"". They can arrive but under the current 30 day mandate no vacation accommodation provider can accept their bookings or in any way house them. The mandate applies to all four US Virgin Islands."
"Yep, sttres, me and hubs will be down to crash at your place LOL!"
"So there won't be any trouble arriving there tomorrow? Also, are all tourist attractions closed?The National Park for example - how about ferries between the islands?Thanks in advance."
<< “ So there won't be any trouble arriving there tomorrow?” >>Where do you plan to stay?
"Almost all tourist attractions are closed along with bars and restaurants. Given all the restrictions and closures, with more flights being cancelled every day and with all residents being advised to stay home unless absolutely necessary, I can't understand why anybody would even think of coming here right now.The St Thomas/St John ferries continue to operate, a couple with reduced schedules (which are subject to further reductions) but there is no inter-island ferry service between the USVI and the BVI as the BVI has closed its borders.Where are you planning to stay? There is a 30 day ban on any vacation accommodation owner honoring existing bookings or accepting new ones and heavy financial penalties for those ignoring the ruling.You're well advised to postpone your visit at this time."
An Airbnb - They don't seem to be aware of any restrictions
"<< “ An Airbnb - They don't seem to be aware of any restrictions.’ >>That will most likely change by the time you arrive. The governor's decree specifically mentioned AirBnB as being covered by the ban.Edited: 4:38 pm, March 24, 2020 "
"MattN, the wording was as quoted here:""Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. ordered a moratorium on new hotel guests for the next 30 days, during his COVID-19 update on Saturday (March 21).'No hotel, no timeshare or no Airbnb will be allowed to accept any new guests,' Bryan said.'If you are coming to the Virgin Islands, you will not have anywhere to stay for the next 30 days,' Bryan said, adding this could change 'depending on what we see as far as the spread of the virus in the community.'The ban does not apply to guests that are already here.""The wording is a little ambiguous (new bookings as opposed to reservations already made) but the majority who made reservations for the next 30 days are canceling with many re-booking for a later date or seeking refunds if future travel doesn't fit their plans. It seems that most of those seeking refunds are receiving them with no problem.But again with all the closures and restrictions (and always the possibility of a curfew if the suggested self-isolation proves ineffective) this is really not a good time to visit - not to mention that the number of confirmed coronavirus cases (albeit so far all mild) is jumping daily and the peak is yet to come.I can't imagine that your AirBNB hosts could be unaware of the new mandates and suggest you talk to them before leaving home."
And where are you traveling from? Many states are under quarantine.
"Matt, regardless if they know about the restrictions, you now know. Travelling and putting yourself and your family in a position to arrive and have no where to stay would be ill advised. Not to mention you will be adding to the stress on a small ecosystem that needs all resources to support its residents. Not sure if you are a troll or TIMMMAY looking to say ""I told you so"""
"My husband and I (both under 46 years old) had plans to visit St. John in mid April. We were uncertain whether to travel or not but hoped for the best. A few days ago the owner of our accommodations called us to inform that they're cancelling all reservations for the next three months. I can understand them wanting to do that especially because they rent out part of their home and vehicle so they take extra risks. I was willing to make the trip. We waited a long time and had made the reservations in June of last year. On the other hand my husband was less enthused considering all the panic and actual information.We are now trying to use our American Airlines trip insurance to get a refund or at least get fair postponement options. We put in a claim and are now waiting. Anybody have experience with that yet? Working remotely from home is stressful but a blessing. It's unfortunate that not everybody has that option. I have great appreciation for everybody on the front lines not least of which are the delivery people and cashiers so that life can continue without total chaos. It's such a strange time. I hope things get better soon. I miss the most beautiful place on earth!Edited: 10:10 am, March 26, 2020 "
"Did they offer you a rebooking or a refund? I have been trying unsuccessfully to get a refund from our villa company and I put in my final plea yesterday. They have offered us a rebooking through 2021 but we are not sure we can do that.  I will probably try for reimbursement from Travel Guard but based upon my reading of the policy and the FAQ s on their website it looks as though this situation is not covered.  My experience with the airline trip insurance has been that it is very limited. If they will give you a rebooking, which I believe is the minimum they can do, then it might be easier to do that. We have a party of 8 which is why the rebooking can be difficult for us. Good luck."
"Your flight will likely get cancelled and if it is you are entitled to a refund. When it is cancelled, I would call AA and politely as for a refund. Do not accept a voucher. If necessary, call multiple times. Good luck! Lots of us are in the same situation."
"""Did they offer you a rebooking or a refund?""We are still waiting for AA's response. As for our St John accommodation, it is basically an apartment attached to their home. Unlike other places, they only required a $300 deposit. On the phone they offered to refund it soon but have not done so yet and we did not ask for it to be refunded yet. They are very sweet people. We want to rebook but it depends on so many unknowns right now. Did you pay for the entire reservation? I hope you are able to work out something. Thanks Saffie11. I'd rather get a full refund from the airline. I don't think it is fair for airlines to put a limit on rebooking (especially only 1 year) considering these uncertain times.Edited: 11:36 am, March 26, 2020 "
"Forgot to mention, there was such a long wait on the phone with AA we just did as advised through the automated instructions and put in a claim which requires a 10 day wait time..."
I agree about the time frame. I wrote to my senator and member of congress about it. I think 2 years would be a more fair time frame and more people would be willing to accept vouchers. Did AA put you in a queue to call you back?
A little info about United and refunds https:/…
"Sweet .St. John. Yes, we paid for the entire four bedroom villa already."
"Thank you, Keep Left. I had to go to AT&T today so didn't get a chance to follow up on my refund. Your post is very timely for me! Now I'll have more ammunition when I call."
In St. Thomas 17 cases and 0 deaths as of today. I have been watching this because it looks like a reasonable place to travel. You can look at every single county in the US. https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/
Actually just read St. Thomas is closed to inbound travel from March 25th for 30 days.
"DebbieWDallas, a lot of the reports are rather inexact. There's no port closures at all and our borders aren't closed but the Governor has mandated that hotels and all others who offer vacation rental accommodations cannot accept any bookings for the next 30 days.People can still come and go but visitors won't have any rentals available to them for now. All incoming passengers will have their temperature checked on arrival and are asked (not ordered) to self-quarantine for 14 days after arrival on island.Hope that clarifies."
"I travelled to St. John with family Feb. 18-29. I fell ill with HIGH fever on March. After several ER visits, I was admitted for w week’s hospital stay in Dallas. Others in my group experienced bloated stomachs and achy muscles for several days upon return. First reported case in USVI was around March 8-15? Who knows. There are a lot of reasons you can fall ill in the tropics. The Drs. still have not diagnosed my condition. I am going on one month at home."
I just got back and if you have a place to stay then go. We can’t stop living our lives I’m fine I was there for a month and just use precaution things are closed but you stil can enjoy the beaches and each other.
Popping my popcorn!
"Whether or not you can enjoy the beaches remains questionable. The Governor will be addressing the community again today but unfortunately there are already reports coming in of some beaches being totally packed over the weekend in defiance of the ""no crowding"" mandate. The beaches were re-opened on the condition that people adhered to the current rules and the Governor was clear that if these rules were flouted the beaches would again be closed."
"<< “ We can’t stop living our lives...” >>The quarter of a million or so people who have died from COVID-19 in the past few months would probably disagree... if not for the fact that they have, quite literally, “stopped living their lives.”Edited: 10:30 am, April 27, 2020 "
We are scheduled to stay at the Westin on St. John USVI the week of August 4-11. Is there anything I should be aware of as far as travel time or activities that will be available there considering Covid? Are things open in and around Cruz Bay? Thank you.
C.P. There is a lot of information on this board about traveling during COVID. I suggest you look for comments from Snorkeler-6 and STTResident. They have been very helpful to me.
"C.P. Staying at the Westin next week. I called a few times and as recently as yesterday. Just to check in Resort is open, The pool bar is open but not for sit down. Only to go order. The pool is open and the outdoor restaurant is open as well. Car rental is open as well. Only thing I forgot to check in on was the kayak, boat rental shack."
C.P. an excellent source of general information is https://usviupdate.com/. You can sign up for email updates.
C.P.- My wife and I were there last week and we are going back on the 25th of this month for another week. The Westin is open but social distancing and masks are required. Pool bar is open but no chairs. There are less chairs around the pool and on the beach due to the requirement but we had no problem getting one. Cruz Bay restaurants are open for the most part except for High Tide and 1 or 2 others. All bars are closed like The Drink but bars at restaurants are open but no sitting directly at them. When we went to The Beach Bar we walked up to the bar ordered our drinks to go and had no issue. The taxis are running from the Westin to Cruz Bay without any problem...plenty of them so no long waiting. If you are going to any restaurants we would advise you to make reservations ahead of time. Enjoy your trip. We certainly did. Can't wait to go back.

Thank you so much! That site is terrific. :)
Thank you for sharing the information you learned from your inquiry! Much a appreciated. Enjoy your visit!
Wow! I am happy to learn you had such an amazing time despite what is happening at this time with Covid. It gives me relief as I consider moving forward on our upcoming visit. We were there this time last year and it was so wonderful. I'd hate to miss the opportunity to go out of fear. Your reassurance is very comforting since you were just there. :)
"Or you could let go of ""fear"", and not go to help the world get this pandemic under control."
