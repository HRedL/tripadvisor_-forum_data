"I didn’t want to give this an inflammatory title and have people jump all over me, but it’s about coronavirus and the fact that life does go on and we needn’t go crazy with panic. Something like six cases have been confirmed in Northern California, and being around people of Asian descent does not equal coronavirus exposure (a lot of xenophobia and prejudice have emerged around this calamity).You can find out about airline or TSA restrictions on travel to and from China on their websites or hotlines, but here is some local info about how the epidemic is or is not affecting domestic life in the Bay Area. Especially since this is the Lunar New Year holiday season which typically means folks of Chinese or other Asian background are doing more visiting, attending celebrations, and so on. That was a big reason why the epidemic in China grew, with 100's of millions of people traveling, congregating in public places, and moving around. We don't have that in California. Some local schools have cancelled trips to China. At least one in the City is a K-8 Chinese immersion school where they've lived and breathed Chinese language and culture for 2/3 of their lives, and this is the capstone for the graduates, a lifetime experience they’ve anticipated for years, so everyone is really disappointed. I’ve read several articles about schools and colleges canceling grad or study trips for the rest of the school year – five trips just from the Edmonton AB schools. A couple of public events have been cancelled in Palo Alto; no specific reason given, but maybe the sponsors are being overly cautious, or community input has suggested that many people would skip it … just thinking aloud. https://abc7news.com/5893508/ https:/…Of course, the biggest event of all is the parade in San Francisco’s Chinatown, which can draw up to a million people. It’s scheduled for this Saturday, February 8. This is what the parade website says at the moment:“We are aware of the coronavirus and are monitoring the situation with the guidance of the CDC, WHO, and local health authorities. There are no plans for the cancellation of the parade. Should events change, we will notify everyone through our website, local news, and social media platforms.”You can bet they will do the utmost to avoid cancelling, because the parade is a big tourist thing and many people plan trips to San Francisco around the Chinese New Year holiday – and spend $$$ here. https://chineseparade.com/ https:/…"
"Some perspective: the flu is killing far more people, and CDC continues to urge people to get a flu shot.The WHO even while proclaiming emergency also positively commented on the actions of Chinese health authorities.Sad to see ""othering"" of Asians in America, abetted by prejudice.Read Camus on the plague."
"The unfortunate thing is this 2019-nCoV has a 14-day incubation period and the news broke at the Chinese New Year period (which was why it wasn't contained properly when it first broke out in Wuhan fearing that it would affect the Chinese New Year celebrations in China... before the SHTF).It is conceivable that someone caught the virus, 13th day into it without symptoms, passes on to someone else. While the symptoms finally show on person A, person B may have traveled over lots of places and could spread the virus to numerous others unknowingly until his/her symptoms show. We are just at the beginning of the cycle.Elk Grove already cancelled their Chinese New Year celebration in the city, cited big public gatherings should be avoided. Basically they don't know who among those who plan to come to the event may have recently traveled to China, and may unknowingly carry the virus. I saw similar cancellations of the CNY-related events at other private organizations locally.I don't blame the SF organizers if they wants to cancel. The sponsors will be giving them pressure, of course. Citing irrelevancy, etc.. But hey... there are those, on this day, still want to fly to Hong Kong / Shenzhen to take advantage of the low airfare to do some ""bargain shopping"". (""They"" are those who didn't seem to know there is no seller opening shops to sell them bargain goods because the government tries to keep all their residents at home for another few weeks...even if they could manage to fly there with most flights cancelled.)"
"Most flights from China have been shut down the US is not admitting people who are not citizens or legal residents who have been in China in the last 14 days.So far China has largely contained the spread of the virus to 1 province. If they remain successful, the chances of spreading to the US are much less.Two Chinese New Year’s events were already canceled in Palo Alto. The SF parade organizers have another week or so to make their decision."
"Yup, long incubation period is a 6!+<#. As the Penguin said, a person could be toting the virus around for days, unaware, exposing hundreds of people who are also unaware, then get sick late in the incubation period and finally seek treatment, by which time all the people Vector One exposed have gone through the same cycle, as have the ones THEY have given cooties to. Some health authorities are now cautiously saying the dreaded P-word (Wikipedia, the font of all human knowledge, already has a reference to coronavirus in its article on Pandemics).I have not had a cold or flu yet this winter, and I'm knocking on wood like a woodpecker. I started taking Airborne and zinc early, and while the jury is still out on how effective they are in strengthening our immune system, they can't do any harm if taken in moderation. Haven't seen anyone in the City with a mask during the last couple of weeks, but I tend not to spend much time in crowds. Among the other places that are still planning to hold their parades or festivals are Los Angeles, St. Louis, Chicago, New York City, and our very own Stockton. Madrid and London had theirs already."
