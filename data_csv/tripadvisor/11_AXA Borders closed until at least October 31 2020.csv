"Makes sense Ellen, I wish St. Barths did the same, but I have no idea how to work out those countries which have less than 0.2% of active cases."
A little confusing as first it states closed until Oct 31st but then states allowing people in from Countries that have less than 0.2 % Covid cases of the population starting from July 31st? Did I read this wrongly?
"That's how I read it. oh yes, 0.2% of population.So that's US out and UK does not show active cases.Edited: 2:52 pm, July 25, 2020 "
"CLOSED: until Oct. 31st for US visitors and a few other countries with positive test rates > .2%OPEN: July 31st forward IF: 1. people come from a country with a positive virus rate < .2% of the national population.2. test negative at the Anguilla border.3. do the 14 day quarantine process.4. finally, test negative after the quarantine period."
"Smart! See ya (maybe) in 2021 Anguilla. Oh hey fellow USA peeps, can you put your masks on so we can get out again?"
"Yeah it is smart. We're scheduled for 2 weeks in January but pretty sure that we will have to cancel. At least we can listen to Sprocka, live at Straw Hat on friday evenings on instagram and dream about having the Big Eye Tuna flatbread. They also have a virtual tip jar that goes to the staff."
"beachfan, no kidding. I think Tracey put it best back in... April??... when commenting that it feels like the whole class is being punished with ""no recess"" because of troublemakers. Hopefully there will be an expansion of rapid testing capabilities (EVERYWHERE, not just Anguilla!) that would allow more flexibility in quarantine timing, because obviously this two-week wait is impractical for many visitors.... and even at home, results are taking 10+ days to come back, which is really hard for people who can't WFH."
"If I've done math right, these counties wouldn't be allowed entry right now:PeruSpainChileMexicoIranUSABrazilSouth Africa185 countries would be allowed entry as of 7-31-20 if they have time to quarantine."
Bravi Anguilla! You are to be applauded and respected for your very wise stance.I wish our States would be half as diligent about this serious and dangerous pandemic that has hit our country.
"According to this, there are only a very few countries with positive test rates <.2%https:/…coronavirus-testingCurrent US rate 8.7%"
"Does the British government have any responsibility at a time like this to support Anguilla financially? If ever there was a crucial time to receive help from them, isn't this it?"
"Double edged sword, whatever we do doesn't seem to be enough, but many of them want to be rid off us, can't win. We are responsible for things like defence, training of the police and prisons, meeting various standards, eg maritime and aviation etc.There is probably a list on Wikipedia as to what we are doing for Anguilla."
"A difficult decision for sure.""Keep Anguilla Pristine"""
"In the middle '70s when Nevis and St. Kitts broke from Anguilla and decided to become independent, how did that fare among all 3 countries? Are St. Kitts and Nevis in worse shape with their choice, or is Anguilla suffering more?"
"Actually, Anguilla was under the rule of St. Kitts and Nevis, hence the mini revolution to break off.I don't know the whole story, but Anguilla decided to stay with Britain rather than under the rule of St. Kitts. As to who is better off I have no idea.Edited: 2:13 am, July 27, 2020 "
"With July 31st, 2020 reopening for visitors from eligible countries I believe everyone has to apply for entry prior to arrival per the guidelines at website: www.beatcovid19.ai"
"Isn't it possible that many/most countries will not have a positive test rate < .2% for years, if ever?"
"I'm confused - is the metric (1) positive cases as a % of overall population, or (2) positive cases as a % of those tested? I think it's (1) if I'm reading correctly... in which case... the hardest thing about this metric is how to manage it because it's aggregate cases, not current cases. The US has aggregate cases to date (about 4.3 million) representing approximately 1.3% of the entire ~330 million population. Cases that were positive but the person has recovered aren't tracked very well. How does the US ever get ""down"" to 0.2% using this metric?Edited: 1:33 pm, July 27, 2020 "
"RMG you are correct, the statement reads ""active cases less than .2% of the population""My earlier post was incorrect, it was percent of positive tests. The current US rate of active cases is 6.3%, UK has 0 active cases.Data for all countries can be found here https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/…Edited: 2:31 pm, July 27, 2020 "
"Ah yes, % of population not % of tests. I was responding to an earlier post and made the mistake of not checking the FB post.BTW UK is not at 0 active cases!Edited: 3:14 pm, July 27, 2020 "
"No sure why but now worldmeter is showing 685 new cases today on UK but under ""active cases"" is shows N/A"
"That's what I mentioned in my post no 3..UK shows only critical cases not active cases, hence no way one can calculate 0.2%, Well one can of course calculate the number but cannot compare it to active cases, because they are not reported/displayed.Edited: 3:40 pm, July 27, 2020 "
"Just heard a statistic that America has 4% of the world population, yet 24 % of Covid virus deaths.We're really not doing too well."
"I put very little stock into any ""stats"" that are available. There is little doubt that they are at best inaccurate. Bottom line, we (the USA) are in this boat due to our refusal to get healthy. My son is a front line healthcare provider working as a hospitalist. He suggested months ago that the ""experts"" had the very unique opportunity to use their podium to preach to the masses to get healthier, but those ""experts"" missed that opportunity. I suspect we are one of the most obese societies in the world. Sadly, we are getting what we set ourselves up to get."
"Here's another statistic: 99.96% of Americans have not died from COVID. Back out the bogus stats and the comorbidity case, and that number rises to somewhere near 99.99%."
"And here's another statistic, for the past several days an American has died from COVID every minute."
Oh boy thanks so much for posting—i just booked a trip oct 27th—so i guess that’s not going to work
"Other island nations are allowing the proven healthy US tourists in and it's working. Look at French Polynesia. I hope Anguilla opens up, at least after hurricane season, and in time for the late November through April busier time due to holidays and winter in the US. And, if they want to ensure COVID infections don't come on the island, simply require a negative test prior to departure and can even test when you arrive. Tests are getting better, results faster and more will become available. I was tested recently and the place was empty, healthcare workers bored and just waiting for me to show up. I had the results in 24 hours. I went ahead and booked a trip in December for Anguilla and most of the resorts, from what I've heard, believe they will be open by November. I can always change it for free due to the easier change/cancellation policies in effect for most airlines and hotels through the end of this year (can change to 2021 if need be). I believe 2021 will not be much better than this year just like the flu is still around year after year even though many get vaccinated year after year. It's just something humans will have to develop antibodies for to lessen the effects. Viruses are just that way."
"I will add that when I mentioned French Polynesia as a good example of how a tourism based island nation can open safely I exclude cruises. Cruising is risky because its like a very crowded apartment complex and in the case of a cruise everyone is stuck together for most of the time. I believe they had one crew member (some media erroneously stated passenger) which tested positive and the ship turned around and ended everyone's trip. The crew member had been isolated. That's another safer thing Anguilla has going for it - no cruise ports.St. Vincent and the Grenadines already reopened to USA and is requiring all travelers to fill out a pre-arrival travel form and show proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival. If you do not have a negative PCR test you will be tested on-site. American Airlines has started daily flights to there as well as Aruba. If Anguilla does not open by November then that may appear to some, including other governments and funding institutions, that residents and businesses there have enough funds to make it without US tourism. I hope that won't happen because I fear it could have lasting negative financial outcomes for Anguilla which also would hurt people's health in other ways besides COVID. Ultimately, economies must reopen in the best way possible in order to avoid other catastrophic impacts like more permanent hotel closures and the cost of getting supplies increasing as transportation dries up more and more. Bottom line, let's all practice proper hygiene and wash our hands, wear masks into businesses/stores and stay healthy. If you're sick, stay home. Fear can be costly, but being proactive in a reasonable way can keep jobs."
"TropicAtHeart, Anguilla may decide to reopen in November with the precautions you mention. As far as I know, nothing's been decided past October. Regarding Aruba, it actually has seen an uptick in COVID cases since it reopened for tourism in June. Before tourism reopened, Aruba had had only virus case between the end of April and the end of June. Since tourism reopened, however, Aruba's had 23 new cases, including 18 in the past 2 1/2 weeks. That's obviously a cause of concern on an island with such a small population and explains the cautious approach taken by Anguilla.Edited: 12:14 pm, August 04, 2020 "
"I certainly agree with Anguilla's more cautious approach. I also hope they don't implement the same lack of testing requirements as Aruba. From what I understand, some people from ""low-risk"" US States were allowed to enter without getting tested prior to departure. That mixed with the influx of US visitors stir crazy from the lockdowns coupled with a much higher hotel room capacity vs Anguilla and all the close proximity to hotels of shops/restaurants in Aruba probably didn't help matters. I doubt there will be any tourist heavy nation that will not see some infections even after vaccines are available. It is the new norm. The only place I know of that does not get some of our common colds is probably North Sentinel Island, which doesn't allow visitors and hasn't for centuries. If only stricter protocols had happened in relation to the experiments on bats, this pandemic wouldn't have happened.

"Dave 72055, what were your son’s recommendations for Americans to get healthier? Obviously hand washing, hand sanitizer and mask wearing. What else?"
What travel insurance would you recommend the tripadvisor one and is it reputable reliable? Ive never travelled and almost 60 yrs old—only lived in hawaii and did go to Costa Rica one time—that’s it—anyways would you recommend tripadvisor one? Thanks
"@terrisquires, What is it that you are looking for in a travel insurance policy? Most hotels (general comment and not specific to Anguilla) are offering generous cancellation policies (and most US airlines are offering no-fee flight cancellation or changes - exact travel dates are important). Another way of saying, you may not need travel insurance.When are you looking to go? Can you provide more details?Edited: 9:05 am, August 06, 2020 "
"terisquires, go to the Insure my Trip site, https://tinyurl.com/y5zlaazu and pick cancel for any reason. Also, be aware that at this time Anguilla requires all arrivals to stay in quarantine for two weeks after arrival, at a government facility at the travelers expense. This may change at a later day.Happy planning."
All cancel for any reason polices I have seen required a 25% self-insured retention.Not overly appealing once you figure that in as well as the cost of the insurance.Could consider a high end CC that provides free travel insurance (like the Chase Sapphire Reserve). I have that and use it for our travel expenses. Or consider purchasing traditional travel insurance.
"In general, travel insurance does not cover Covid-19, with the exception of ""cancel for any reason"". The Covid-19 box top left of the page, has plenty of information and resources."
"FWIW, we agree with mgiannetto.Rather than pay for travel insurance, we have ""self insured"" by only booking with airlines offering a no-change-fee option, and only booking with properties that have flexible cancellation & refund policies. Also, if your flights are cancelled or materially disrupted, you can get actual cash back rather than credits, which happened on 3 of our 4 trips.Out of 4 trips (two international, two domestic) that have been cancelled due to Covid, we have succeeded in getting about 90% cash back, 10% credits (Amtrak, TWA Hotel for an early JFK departure, and a domestic American itinerary that we cancelled ourselves in March). We didn't attempt to get a refund for our Anguilla lodging as we're fine just moving our trip to next May, fingers crossed."
"RMG and Mike, both of your suggestions are good. I am talking about a traveler getting Covid-19 and having to cancel, that would not be covered under regular trip insurance."
"My wife and I buy ""cancel for any reason"" quality insurance everytime even though we travel free on points (flights and hotels). The reason is because the very best credit card provided trip insurance is not good enough for us in my opinion. It's more than cancellation. It's about delays, booking you on other flights, or evacuating you if the need arises. A lot of people don't realize Medicare doesn't help in many nations and even US territories where the doc or hospital expect payment at time of service. We've made claims and it fully reimbursed us even the transportation to the med facility. We've been on islands where the doctor only came to island once in a while, so then a good travel protection company will have multilingual reps who go the extra mile to find the most qualified medical person on that island or get you to the nearest island that does. We've even had them to pay for the person to come straight to our bungalow. We've also stayed in much nicer hotels on airline delays when they would have stuck us on a bad flight in bad seats and then put us up in the next transit city in a low quality motel. We ended up choosing a nice 5 star on a beach in San Juan for the extra night since there was no option getting all the way home that day even if they placed us on another airline, which the originating airline was going to do (the line of people to rebook was still long as we headed to our beach hotel - all I had to do was call the travel ins. co from the seat of the aircraft that had mechanical problems and I knew wouldn't take off). Also, emergency medical evacuation by helicopter to a full hospital from some places can cost $50,000 and most CC included insurance won't cover that. I've never had a problem with CSA Travel which is owned by a large European company. They spent a lot one year, and a lot of time, to get tourists out of an area in which the airport had shut down. They had to get buses to transport tourists to another country just to get them home. It's the logistics that they know how to do so well. Also, if you already have pre-existing conditions it's always best to choose the premium plans."
"Definitely don't smoke. Limit your alcohol intake. Most importantly, get your BMI down to a healthy level. Let me tell you.....that ain't easy. Obesity and COVID is a very bad combo."
