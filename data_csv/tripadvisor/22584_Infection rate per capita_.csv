Hi does anyone know how I can see the infection rate per capita for turkey? It seems to be that the U.K. gov are using it to determine whether or non countries will be put on the ‘ all but essential travel list’ and so I’m wondering what it is in Turkey. Thanks !

Thank you both!
"Do we need to be worried about the slight infection increase? Talk of Greece lockdown in places, seen comments about possible changes of quarantine rules on return to U.K. from France. Is turkey in a good or bad position? What are people’s thoughts?"
"I suppose no one knows really..... I’m not sure what Spain’s per capita was when we ( the U.K.) took them off the air corridor. So much data and all really confusing. Still not sure what the rate of infection per capita in turkey is for comparison to Spain , to make some kind of judgement about where/ if to go!!"
"I know, that’s what I was trying to work out but it’s very confusing trying to compare. They also say it’s to do with the actual number of tests being carried out in each country. I suppose the more tests that are done the more positive cases they will find! I’m supposed to be going on Sunday, stressing now!"
"From ITV: When Spain was removed from the UK's ""Safe list"" its infection rate was 50 cases per 100,000. When Luxembourg was removed a short while it was 240 people per 100,000.https://www.itv.com/news/2020-08-04/which-eu…"
And what is turkeys latest figure?
"The rate per 100,000 in Turkey was around 17, that was maybe a week ago."
"I'm more uncomfortable about the infection rate in other tourists. Unless of course you go to the rare destination that has mostly Turkish holiday makers, In the meantime, wear a mask, don't touch your face, wash your hands, keep your distance and you should be fine."
"I’m ok about the likelihood of me getting the virus, as I will be as safe as I possibly can. It’s the worry of the U.K. government stopping flights, placing turkey on quarantine list, having to fly home early etc that worries me"
"I wouldn’t worry too much , France is higher and still not been taken off the list"
"Still, it's worth remembering that the Greeks did very well, and then their infection rate rose from 22 per 100,000 to 49 a week later and 92 a week after that. Alasi this virus brooks neither complacency nor even what may seem to be common sense assumptions. Stay safe, everyone."
"The Greeks are at 15.5 per capita up from around 4 or 5 per capita 2 weeks ago not 92 per capita!!! Still extremely low in the scheme of things especially if you are young, fit, hygienic and are prepared to protect the vulnerable. Life needs to move on"
"Sorry, 92 per week. Daily numbers go up and down, so I don't follow those. (Indeed, if one were to do so, the French routinely report 0 on Saturdays and Sundays, because they can't be bothered to announce at the weekend, and then atrocious numbers on Monday.) ;)Edited: 7:53 am, August 12, 2020 "
"Trying not to worry too, we're flying over on the 27th with TUI and if Turkey goes on the quarantine list our holiday will be cancelled...or at least postponed. Keeping a close eye on those daily figures, not that it will make any difference!"
