I hope this is the right place to post this! We are a mother daughter travellers trying to get back home to Singapore but am currently stuck in Napier without any domestic flight back to Auckland. Are there any ways where we could grab a ride to Auckland during this lockdown? Advice greatly appreciated!!
"Kia ora,No, you are supposed to stay where you are, being in a confined space like a car endangers everyone. Sorry, but that is the way it is."
If you have a booking back to Singapore you are allowed to travel back to Auckland.Best of luck.
"True that you can go if you are booked on a flight, but it sounded like you where trying to get back and not booked. I have looked at the intercity bus website and it looks like there is nothing so I assume they are not running. Sharing transport with others is not keeping more that 2m away so really you should consider staying where you are unless you really do need to go for a very important reason."
InterCity Buses have stopped all services during the lockdown. I just checked Air NZ and unfortunately for you there do not seem to be any flights from Hawkes Bay to Auckland over the next week. Surprising to me as there are occasional flights from other centres.
You might be able to hire a car (not sure on this) but you must have a CONFIRMED flight out of the country to travel anywhere.Do you have a confirmed booking on a plane and have a ticket for that travel?..
Just saw this on another thread.https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coro…
It looks like all the car rentals out of Napier are closed. I would not recommend self drive to Auckland in one go unless you are very a experienced driver.
Hi FluffyI feel for you. Do you already have a flight booked out of Auckland?If you have a flight booked - take a read here https:/…if you don't have a flight booked you are required to stay where you currently are. Best of luck :)
"Please just stay where you are. The more peole move around, the greater chances of this virus spreading. Is it really so bad to be 'stuck' in Napier??? If you do have a Singapore flight already booked and organised, perhaps get in contact with your Singapore embassy - embassies tend to be able to pull more strings to help their citizens/ residents."
"Government to government processes will be best as they will target the safety of the locals with the need to get people home.Contact your embassy a and sit tight.With all this cr@# in the world at the moment being ""home"" is important, but you need to be ""well""."
"I feel for all the people stuck overseas as they may have limited finances to stay put ""as long as it takes"" so if there is any chance of getting home to the safety of their own home to isolate I think many will be looking at that option."
"Yes, finances are an issue for some, but not all, and the potential for financial cost may be higher if they get the virus. As far as ""getting home to the safety of their own home"", it is the getting home bit is the most unsafe thing anyone can do at the moment, so staying put really would be best for everyone."
Well looks like they have sorted it for those in Peru
These people left on the 22nd. This is why you can't always trust travel agents.https://www.complex.com/life/2020/04/honeymo…
There are some truly stupid people out there.
"It's good the Peru situation is getting sorted, that one sounds like it really is becoming untenable for the people stuck there."
An article on the Stuff website says Lufthansa have 5 747's and 5 380's in NZ to take folk home via Thailand.2 747 parked in Christchurch today.
"Wonderful to see international cooperation to get people home. Thailand to NZ to Europe is an interesting route, I presume they will stop somewhere else enroute? The plane can spend up to 10 hours on the ground in NZ, but no one gets off the plane. That is a long flight home."
I agree it is so good to see Governments trying to assist their nationals in these trying times.It must be very worrying to be a long way from home with very limited ways of getting home.
"WL, I think it's NZ to Thailand to Europe, not that indirect. Just nice to hear about some planes flying and crews getting paid at this point."
"***The plane can spend up to 10 hours on the ground in NZ, but no one gets off the plane. That is a long flight home.+++I don't think the passengers would mind as long as they can get home safely in the current climate."
