"If you're waering the same disposable mask for 2 weeks, that would be for appearances"
"Masks are primarily for the benefit of others, but also offer some protection for self. I think most wear it for those reasons. Anyone who’d only wear it for appearances’ sake probably wouldn’t bother at all. Just my opinion, of course."
"I do wear a mask more than once, since I only wear it into a store for approx. 30—45 minutes about twice a week. It definitely is not for appearances, but for my benefit as well as others."
"I am wearing a mask to protect others; my understanding is masks do more to protect others from me, versus protect me from others. I am currently in northern Virginia -- and we are a hot spot, under shelter-in-place orders. The cases (and deaths) are still increasing here, while in other areas the number of cases has been decreasing. We have multiple fabric masks now (took a while to get them -- first two orders were cancelled by the sellers as they ran out, apparently), all of which are washable, so we can cycle through them. After each wearing, it goes in the wash. If I am going to be out longer with more potential contact (i.e., grocery shopping versus just picking up take-away) then I can also slip a filter into the mask.Mostly I am just trying to stay home. We are fortunate as we can both telework."
I line the inside of our cloth masks with coffee filters which get thrown out after each wear and masks get washed.
"Neither reason. I am wearing a mask (when grocery shopping) because it is what we have been asked to do for public health safety here in King Co. It is for both myself and others.I agree the ""just for appearances"" people are probably the ones not wearing one at all."
"The phrase used here for Mask wearing is “ I protect you and you protect me” I have been nowhere to wear one. We do not need one for walking in a quiet area, nor for in our large garden and that’s all I’ve been. My husband has worn mask and gloves a few times when he has been out."
“I protect you and you protect me” -- very nice way to think about it.
Wonderful phrase!Please send it to our government to replace the nonsense we've got.I will wear a mask when we get invaded with visitors from all over the country next weekend. I know It's been said that it offers little protection but it would make me feel safer. I doubt it will enhance my appearance ;-)People have got so slack at distancing here I've been sorely tempted to get a teeshirt printed with the highly not politically correct 'I'm infectious'. That would keep me safe from those who don't want to bother.
We face covering and wash them on a regular basisAs far as the benefits and risks go i think this explains it from a WHO viewpointhttps:/…
"I wear them in stores, but not when we walk. Why bother if we are all alone on the walking paths?"
"Shoes on walking paths- I prefer to leave them in garage just due to dirt and bird droppings etc. but not due to RonaEdited: 3:13 pm, May 23, 2020 "
Oh you mean masks on walking path sorry. My walking paths have a lot of people
"We wear cloth masks and they get washed after use. Disposable mask ran out of stock over 2 months ago, and have not been seen since - same as rubbing alcohol. But since the main purpose of the mask is to protect others from me, even a reused disposable is not 'just for show'."
"Since I learned that wearing a mask keeps my ""condensation/droplets"" inside it, I wear one to protect others when I know I will not be able to keep the 2 metres distance from others. Otherwise the instant sauna that is created is hot, humid and uncomfortable to breathe in.More people are wearing masks now, at the suggestion of the Chief BC Medical Officer, so now I also feel protected from others.I have a cloth mask with coffee filters and a package of non-surgical masks. The nsm is much easier. I sterilise it by putting it in the oven at 170°F for 30 minutes. Any virus is inactivated and the filtering effectiveness is retained."
"I have a disposable mask that I have used multiple times, but only when I visit my dermatologist for treatment. Unlike the rest of Australia, which does not recommend masks, he insists on them while in his clinic. Seeing as I am only in there for less than five minutes, I am not going to throw out the mask each time. Between visits, I store it in the sealed plastic bag that it came in.We are awaiting an order for some washable, microwave sterilisable fabric filtering masks which should arrive next week."
"I wear cloth masks for both my benefit and for the benefit of others in stores that I need to go to.I know that many medical experts say that wearing one only protects others - but if others aren't wearing one (which is the majority of people here) , I feel that my mask is giving me more protection than not wearing one."
"I don't like wearing a mask outside, in the street and even less in parks or forests. And I can't imagine running with a mask.The mask is proving rather divisive, that's an issue in a society that is already very divided. Some passers-by show fear, or then hate, in their eyes."
"I wear a mask any time I am in a public place - grocery store, gas station, etc. We are having very good compliance where I live but there are some who can't or won't wear a mask. I just try to keep a safe distance away from them.In today's nola.com (New Orleans newspaper available on-line) there was a really fun article showing many of the different masks that people are wearing around town. Take a look if you are looking for something a little light-hearted!!"
"Fabric masks are to protect others, not to benefit me. Yes, I'm wearing it."

"Honestly, I'm just wearing the mask because I have to."
"<""Fabric masks are to protect others, not to benefit me. "">Much depends on the quality of the fabric mask. A tight weave fabric, a filter and a secure fit will likely provide some protection to both wearer and to others. And if it's missing some or all of those things, then it might not be providing protection to anyone.Edited: 11:14 am, May 25, 2020 "

"trektheusa, #27, yes, and there's nothing wrong with that."
"Since we are allowed to leaving home by local health authority, my wife and I are wearing Fabric Mask each time we are participating to a public activity even if most medical experts say that it is protecting others and not greatly benefiting us. It is a question of respect of others I protect you, you protect me). We should consider that a Fabric Mask is an additional measure, when respecting first rules of ""staying at home if having COVID-19 symptoms"", ""frequently washing hands"", ""2 m distanciation"", etc. for reducing the coronavirus propagation. It is both together and individually that we will win this world battle by saving lifes as well as our economy and quality of life. ""Il y a encore tellement de villes et villages que j'aimerais visiter"""
"Did some shopping yesterday, and we both wore our masks to the hardware stores.Hunt"
"“ It is a question of respect of others I protect you, you protect me”Exactly. I wish everyone understood that."
"See the video reposted by Dan P which is very clear on the philosophy :""I protect you, you protect me"" underlying wearing a Fabric Mask.https:/…"
I am wearing a mask like my life depends on it.

"Since the thread has been brought back, I’ll add, I wear mine, for the benefit of any, and all around me.Hunt"
My friend sent me a photo of his face shield. Looks straight out of a sci-fi movie. But he's a hypochondriac
"OK an update I guess, since someone topped this thread from March. Things have changed a lot in Seattle since then. Most people do willingly use masks when they are out. Some grocery stores require them. Others are at your choice but I'd say 80% are."
"The very few places, where I have gone, have been 100% masks required.Hunt"
"Whole Foods :) can't get in without one (they hand them out at the door, but most here have their own)."
"I shop only in one grocery supermarket, Whole Foods, and wearing a mask is required and enforced. I do not wear mask when we walk and never did - there are no people around, so why bother? Have not driven to Boston yet and will be wearing a mask there for sure. Am wearing a mask in my parents’ apartment building, which is not an assisted living facility (the fine for those who don’t obey is $300). Do not wear a mask when I am inside their apartment, but try to keep social distancing as required."
"Besides WF, the places here where masks are actually a requirement and where I will be sometime later this month include my dental office, nail salon, and hair dresser."
Why would anyone wear a mask just for appearances?
They wouldn't. People are just being (posting) argumentative about mask wearing for some reason.
"Virginia is now under a statewide mask mandate for indoor public space since end of May. There are still some people who don't wear it, either they have a medical reason or are rogue citizens trying to make a statement!I am wearing mine as mandated."
In case anyone is interested there are some great YouTube videos on how to wear a mask without fogging or hurting your ears. Nurseminder is on that offers lots of options for both. I have no affiliation. I use dish soap very dilute to prevent my glasses from fogging. And if you have a surgical mask pinch the nose.
{It's basically peer pressure.}Wrong. Doesn't matter how many times you repeat an uneducated statement. I won't make it true or correct.
"I read lipstick sales down! Not sure if trueAlthough I certainly still wear face cream, there are video calls scheduled.Edited: 1:26 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"Joyce and Dean. In an attempt to educate you (if only it were possible), in England, if we don't wear masks on public transport, we are not allowed on or we are fined. It's the same in shops where social distancing is impossible. Please try to explain to me where the peer pressure is? I am eagerly awaiting your answer. However, I will not hold out any hope of a coherent reply."
"Because your ""opinion"" is just plain wrong.Your ""opinion"" that people are wearing face masks during the Covid epidemic only because of ""peer pressure"" is not true.It can be an ""opinion"" yet still be incorrect."
J&D you still haven't said why having to wear masks is peer pressure.
"Why ridicule people if they want to wear a mask or if their country asks them to?Here as far a I know it is not mandatory but I have seen a few people wearing them. I always assume they have an underlying condition or are compromised or perhaps are just worried, no crime. I have some masks in the car and if I am asked to wear one I will.I guess some people just hate being told what to do."
"OK I just walked down to Walgreen's a few blocks away from my home. I'd say ~50/50 here on Capitol Hill (not in CHAZ proper, but pretty darn close) . Bikers & runners weren't wearing them. But regular pedestrians and folks shopping doing errands, clerks in the store, were."
I wear spectacles If I am forced to wear a maskCan I claim CONDENSATION
If you check out J&D's Facebook page which they kindly provided a link on their profile page you will find photos of him wearing a face covering and he thinks he looks coolAs for peer pressure according to his wife his grandchildren wanting him to wear one
Ashtonian please see my post earlier on glasses foggingOh I don’t know what number Post it is but there are YouTube videos to help prevent fogging and ear pain. Nurseminder had the best ones but there are manyMy tip spray inner glasses with very dilute dish soap and let dry.
"Sorry guys it was just a jokeYeah , I know I should stick to being a paper boy, not a comic"
For those that did not understand it. Compensation -condensation
"I wear a mask whenever I have to go into a place with there are other people. I wear to protect myself as well as others around me. Everyone has their own reasons why they wear or don't wear a mask. Please do not think that you know why some people do and some people don't wear them. You can only speak for yourselves and no one else. If someone doesn't wear one near me, I avoid them, Their health is their own business, but I will not let their decisions affect my own health. If you are wearing or not wearing a mask because of what you think other people may think of you, what a way to live your life."
#66 - Bravo!!!!
"@66). You post here once , and you get a Bravo....come back soon....lol. @67). I'm not being snarky...he's from my home forum...it's just a joke."
I also very much agree with Post #66
Mike.Are you saying you had an eye test and the eye doctor was right up in your face with no mask on?I find that unbelievable.
"MikePersonally, I would have said sorry but I am not going to put myself at risk and left"
Mike Was the doctor also wearing a shieldAlthough you knew the doctor you did not know the people they saw before you and I resume the doctor was in close proximity to you for a good period of time
"Shopping is a wee bit different to spending the amount of time an eye exam takes to complete, with someone so very close to your face! I would have left too.Edited: 3:58 pm, June 14, 2020 "
"I am a little surprised that your doctor, as a healthcare provider, is that cavalier about infection control. Wearing a mask is part of universal precautions even before Covid time."
"I have to see my optometrist too. I'll wear a mask regardless of what happens. The most boring exam in the world. Which is sharper....?I'm a little more concerned about getting a haircut... I intend to wait a few weeks after they open up before going.Edited: 4:33 pm, June 14, 2020 "
"@Mike,Yes, my eye doctor has always worn a mask while doing exam. I don't know about chiro because have never seen one."
"Made my weekly trip up to Whole Foods Roosevelt. Seattle is pretty much masked-up. No one is forcing anyone, here it seems it's more just become the cool/right thing to do. So people comply."
"I'm going to the hairdressers on Tuesday, was told I have to wear a mask, and if I don't have my own, they have them there. The last time I went, was just before they were closed, my hairdresser was extra careful, about making sure all was wiped down, knowing her, i have no hesitation going. Also just went to the dentist last week, took my temperature before I went in, everyone was covered up, they were also staggering patients, only one person in at a time."
I'm not sure why it's so hard to understand it's different in different places.
"I went to have my teeth cleaned on Thursday. The hygienist was in full gear of gown, gloves, mask, and face shield as I would have expected for a procedure so “in your face”. But the other staff, even the receptionists, were in masks, you had to stay in your car until they called you, they took your temperature and you had to wear a mask until you removed it for the cleaning. I had to sign a form for my health insurance and they even wiped down the pen they gave me to sign it!I am going for a haircut on Tuesday and have to wear a mask. I feel comfortable having my hair cut, as I have seen the same stylist for years, and her establishment is an opener-operated salon with a single chair.It’s really interesting to read about the variations across different areas and cities. The message by public health here is that we look after each other; we wear masks if it is difficult to maintain social distancing. With masks, I protect you, you protect me. It must be working as we have had no new infections for the past 17 days."
"I'm a little bit jumpier than other people in other provinces, I guess. In Quebec we have had over 5000 deaths while BC has had less than 200. True that many of them were in old folks homes which are terrible places to begin with. We opened schools and immediately kids and teachers were getting the virus. So a few weeks wait to see what happens is okay. Plus being over 65 and taking heart medications is also an influencing factor.Everyone has their own particular set of circumstances which will decide their actions.Edited: 5:57 am, June 15, 2020 "
"Exactly sssnakes_alive. What you do and where you are willing to go depends upon circumstances where you live. I would be nervous in Montreal, but here in NL, not so much. BTW, we had no virus diagnosed in any of our long term care homes. Personally? I think we were just lucky..... and no schools open here until September, if then.Edited: 6:49 am, June 15, 2020 "
Janidd I wish more places were like that. Too many people care more about their civil liberties and themselves than keeping others safe. That's why in my state we continue to see 300+ new cases a day
"I go into a store, staff are not wearing masks, those shopping majority are not wearing masks...does that mean, what the heck, I won't wear one either....no, I will wear one, we all think differently, sometimes it just takes a little thought and look at the big picture....how are things going where you live."
"I'm rethinking my objection to the use of the phase ""peer pressure"". Since everyone here in Seattle is pretty much wearing masks, if you do not wear one you stand out as foolish or a needless renegade. So maybe in fact there is some amount of ""peer pressure"" if that means doing the right thing and wearing one as we are asked to do like everyone else around you."
Peer pressure is not always a bad thing!
