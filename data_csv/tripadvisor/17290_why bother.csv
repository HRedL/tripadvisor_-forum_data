"why bother ,everybody seems to struggle for a visawhat about malariai see now posts for packs of dogsvarious injections for other diseasesmy wife and i arrive 12th november first time hotel horizon with rob and sue from grimsby what have they talked me into"
"Danny once your there for a few days you will either love it or hate.If you love it everything else you will forget about, i.e. Visa, Malaria.Go with an open mind and see what you think.:-)) GelEdited: 7 years ago "
"Danny I don't find the visa application a problem, I take my tablets and have the jabs. It's all part of my holiday for me. I will do what it takes to get me to goa. In my opinion it's worth it I absolutely love the place and have never felt so drawn to a country as I have with India."
"If you go with that attitude you are going to hate it here, sometimes you have to make an effort to get the best out of life also if you read about the terrible things that happen in the UK you would think twice about going there.. lolIndia is not everyone's cup of tea but go with an open mind and try to enjoy yourselves if only for your friends sake, would be interested to read your comments after you have been"
"India, Goa is a complete dichotomy (contradiction), it can have the best and worst of something check by jowl. As previous posts if you love it……well it gets under your skin and then the good just out strips the not so good, and you may just fall for the place......"
Good luck mate its a right old dump too loads of burning rubbish everywhere. Cows roaming the streets.Beggars.I don't know why we bother either.Oh now i remember....Wonderful people.Great food and drink.Amazing sights and smells.Im sure you will love it
"The jabs, visa, long flights and all the other Very minor irritations are part of my holiday too. I dont care about them and they dont stress me out.We have been to less hassle places and for us its no contest when it comes to India not just Goa, the whole country and it people has captured our hearts.So I often wonder why bother too....when I see all the moaning minnies get started about the visas, jab, mozzies, tipping, beggars and sellers and dogs...If you find all these things such a pain go to Fuengerola, Gambia or some other place ..Why put up with all the stress????"
"Why bother?Lots of people do bother (and year after year) so there must be something that makes it worth all the 'hassle' before you go.It's there for you to discover, as LondonGel says, you'll either love it or hate it (hope it's the former).You surely did some research about Goa before you booked, so you must have thought it was somewhere you'd like to go - unless your thread is tongue-in-cheek about negative threads.You see all the posts about people having problems with visas but that is only a very small percentage of the number who apply and don't have problems.You get a few people posting to say they've got their visas back OK but most don't so it just looks like everybody struggles with the application process."
"Danny, go with an open mind and I'm sure you'll have a brilliant time. Just think about the awful weather in the UK whilst you're out in that wonderful Goan sunshine for a start!Personally we've never had any problems with the visas (says she touching wood), yes it's a bit of a pain but it's a great feeling when you've got your visas back and know that soon you'll be on your way. The injections don't bother me, even in the UK we need some vaccinations so I've been having them for most of my life - I vaguely remember having one at primary school and being given a barley sugar for not crying lol. I've never had a problem with the dogs either, the only time I've ever been bitten by a dog is in the UK.Yes there are some disadvantages to Goa, but isn't that the case everywhere. The advantages of the fantastic weather, beautiful beaches, delicious food and friendly people more than make up for IMHO.Don't forget the trip report when you get back ;-)"
"Danny,You’ve made 34 contributions on the TA Goan forum since August, so with less than a moth to go why bother with why bother?"
"Danny, I understand your concern. Malaria and other epidemics are broken out everywhere. Yes! Degree of epidemic matters always. Take the precautions. Govt. also spreads messages in public domain to take major precautions. I agree that there is a problem with Visa application process. But It does not take your right to visit any country. You will get It.Don't get panic as fear nips the enjoyment in the bud. It is a good place during this season. You will love it surely! Have fun there!Edited: 7 years ago "
"Danny, once you're at the airport and checked in you'll forget about all the negativity and just be looking forward to getting there.True there are a couple of minor things (and thats all they are) but that can be said of every place in the world. Your first night when you're sat there with a cold drink in your hand you'll be thinking to yourself ""what was I thinking"". Open your mind and your eyes and embrace what there is to see and do."
"The first time we went, I hated it from the minute we stepped out of the airport. I would have happily got back onto the plane and come home if we had been allowed to...by the way...I did ask.It took about 3 days to relax, chill, see it for what it is....now....Love it, cant wait to go back and go every year...the visas...dont worry about them, dont do them myself...the injections...wow its nothing and you dont have to have them every year...the Malaria tabs....better safe than sorry. Its the only place ive been to in the world, where I can get home and KNOW ie had a holiday...Just chill and go with the flow"
True its the only place we have returned to many times and feel so good when we come back to all the hassle of home and appreciate what we have here.
"i think Badgerlads post says it all, the reasons why we keep going back,dont worry go and enjoy,then come back on and tell us what you thought about yor holiday please,good or bad"
After the first 24 hours you'll have forgotten all your worries and you will have a fantastic time i'm sure.I for one would happily return if we could.I would put up with the visa worries the injections and all the other stresses and strains to go back to the wonderful place that is Goa.Like someone said you will either love it or hate it but i bet when you come home after a week or 2 you will be looking to go back .ENJOY AND STOP WHITTLING.
"It will be my first time in November, Didn't have any problems filling out visa forms thanks to meerkat's guide. Have opted for malarone for malaria, injections all done spent 20 mins in doctors. Was apprehensive a few months ago but after reading loads of old trip reports I for one can't wait to get on the plane!!"
"I'm surprised no ones mentioned the 'rip off taxis' or the 'sunbed situation' 'no smoking in public places' or the 'men on bikes' lolDannyboy as everyone here has already said, go with an open mind, take the same precautions as you would at home to keep street safe, it will probably take a couple of days to get over the culture shock. Goa has been likened to Marmite, You will either love it or hate it, I hope you do see beyond all the things mentioned on this thread and enjoy your holiday.I'd be interested in your thoughts when you return."
"We always smuggle a few bits of food from the breakfast at the hotel, wrap them up in a napkin and take them on the beach with us to feed the dogs...they are most grateful and it something we do every morning at the beach shack...it's great"
Only when you get there will you know whether it has all been worth the bother. Hopefully it will be.
Exactly! Why bother? Better to stay at home or else go to Benidorm.
To be honest i never had any worries about visas and goa till i started reading ta visas always came through within a week and I had never heard of the smoking ban TA has its good advice plus trouble and strife
I wonder how many go with out ever reading all this doom and gloom?
Will meet you in the prince William in castleford before you go to put your mind at rest if you like
"Malaria, dogs and visas ?You still have to meet the airport porters the beggars and the deaf kids.I love it!"
Not forgetting when the plane lands a flight attendant walks down the aisle spraying poison into the air.
And the squits lol
"lol Barkingcreek, but Dannyboy did theese friends of yours not tell you anything about Goa? come on now they must have"
"Good point alishamoonbeam. The people who post on this forum are a very,very small minority of the people who actually travel to Goa. We meet up with about twenty people who come and go while we are there and none of them go onto this forum. They have all been going for donkeys years and all the so called "" doom and gloom"" is probably just routine for them. In my 17 years going there i haven't had :- A problem filling my visa forms in (personally can't see why people use agents when you give them the information to all the questions anyway) Haven't been attacked or bit by packs of dogs Haven't had malaria No bags snatched Sellers on the beach have become good friends and i don't mind them at all Injections not a problem, they last for years and you need them for a lot of other places anyway Rubbish everywhere - take a look around our streets at home and when you are driving about. (must admit they could do a lot better though) Always had a sunbed Don't mind the price increases on food and drink (again look at our own increases on everything) Anyway sorry to go on a bit . Have been fortunate enough to go to some great countries around the world which leave Goa standing in terms of beaches, seas, things to see and do etc. but no other place gives me the all round buzz and satisfaction that Goa brings along with its lovely people and glorious eating places  So ""WHY BOTHER"".  Because we love it for what it is."
Not on the plane i hope BC....;-)
"Badgerlad - it's not just Goa where this happens on the plane, we had that on way to China and on the train from Mongolia to China a doctor and Nurse came round asking for our yellow fever jab certificate and asked whether we had any breeding ( bleeding) lol. As for the squits, I can get them anywhere even in the UK so nothing new when I get to India. Dannyboy just go with an open mind and embrace Goa warts and all - have a great time."
"Here here aljuan, great post...."
"I still can't work out whether dannyboy has started this thread to wind people up, to amuse himself (and maybe others), to generate a discussion about what is good and bad about Goa or as a genuine question.I pity Rob and Sue if he really doesn't like Goa when he gets there. LOLI've never recommended Goa to anyone else and never would.I have at least 3 sets of friends that I know would hate it."
"danny dany,, this goa, its,like beni, well calangute /candolim,baga,,are //,the south is more like india,//, , in spain,, dont u be worrying about them bad dogs thay very nice and there not in big packs, ENYMORE. thay may sound like it when thay are howling at night but, there only be a few realy ,lol,,,as for the jabs u, have to get them for a lot of paces not just india,,,just think of that very cheap beer ect u soon be singing at one of the karaoke bars with the best of them, and getting stuck in to a meat pie and downing a BIG,kingfisher,,lol,, and the very nice goan people will look after u well,,,,one thing about goa u will never forget it thats for sure,lol,,,,but all joking apart ,,we go to turkey a lot same thing there with the dogs.ish /jabs,ectg,,,,so no big diff in say calangute, ,to beni but the 9 hour plane ride,,so dont u worry u be ok,,kingfisher BIG one 650m,,for 75 pence,ish u know it makes sense have fun bye,"
Dannyboy if thas from cas then it will be paradise for you they have running water and electricity only joking you will love it once you get into it were from posh end of cas. Featherstone haha
"I'm with aljuan on this one. There must be thousands of UK vistors to Goa every year, but only a few post on here. Most people who do are regulars to Goa, who return year after year because they love the place. Only a small minority actually go on here to complain, and then it's often about something most peope have no problems with (visas, dogs etc).So forget the few negative vibes, read the positive stuff, go with the flow and you will love it. Hopefully!Edited: 7 years ago "
"Al right!!!!, the Visa is a pain in the ar--se, The sunbed problem is a pain for an older person like me ,BUT , Goa is a great place to holiday,I cannot begin to explain the feeling of being in Goa with the sun on you back a drink in your hand and all that wonderfull grub!!! watching the world go by is a treat ,as all the sights and sounds will be new to you. i love the sound made by the beach sellers drums , it makes my skin prickle.So!!! we might moan sometimes , show me a place that no one moans about?? I have not found it yet.Look on the Las Vegas forum and see how the yanks moan about the five* star hotels , they are great hotels, but you still get people moaning.. such is human nature.Go on your holiday unless you are a square and very fussy , you will love Goa for what it is. stop worrying , go and have fun!!!!"

OH I forgot to mention the corrupt Politicians and the Corrupt Police...But Hey you should be used to that with living in the UK.
Thought the same 10 years ago and have visited every year since Arrived 1st year hating Goa Left after 2 weeks loving it
"Danny ... its organised chaos sometimes .disorganised chaos ,walk through it all with eyes and mind wide open ..you,ll love it we do .. steve n caz"
"Back in 1999 my brother came over for our wedding in Calangute, he never left the hotel room for the first 4 hours as his head was completely wrecked, he couldn't handle the place at all. One week later he was absolutely gutted to be leaving Goa. Nuff said really!"
"I agree with Stalex, the first time we went to Goa in 1998 I could only get my OH to agree to go for a week, we were both gutted when we left and subsequently went every November and March for the next 6 years!! We have given Goa a break for the last 7 years as there is a big wide world out there but have a guess where we have been drawn back to - Goa, going back on 6 December for 3 weeks, there is nowhere in the world quite like it. Regarding the negatives about visas, malaria, dogs etc etc - you know us Brits, we aren't happy unless we are having a moan about something - but we can't moan about the weather in Goa so we will have to moan about their dogs!!"
Hi jachyd we also has a break for 8 years going back in 2009 and getting straight back into the place. Roll on Feb.
Why bother Dan ... Sorting out the visa .. Malaria tabs ... Rabid dogs ...cost of taxi to Callengutte ... The Trots ... Putting up with weirdos walking the beach ... Eating prawns as big as babys arms ..drinking Fenney (how could you ) lying on the sun bed and the dreaded sellers wake you up and ask you if you want an ice cream.......I can't wait to come back ...
"hi danny, it goes like this - ""why bother"" means to me stepping off the plane and smelling the lovely heady scents in the air, battling the airport chaos and just knowing that i have come 'home'. Then i can look forward to a few weeks of chilling on the beach, eating good freshly cooked meals and feeling the hot sun on my old bones. And being with the close friends we have made these last few years. The positives do outweigh the negatives.Couldn't go last season as i had a complex open heart operation in march and cried for weeks, but just been given the go-ahead to fly and hopefully we will be there in january. agree with PPC as to why you asked the question with less than a month to go, you must have wanted to be bothered when you booked the holiday. i will be interested to read how you got on when you return."
"Hi runtiger, good to hear from you again and that you've had the all clear to fly. I hope you manage to get back to Goa again this year."
"Stalix... have u heard about the water disprution embarking on bardez within the next 55 days, talk of essential need only water tanks! Its a project to replace the water system the whole of Bardez!!"
"Well I have certainly read about this water disruption somewhere , i think your info is correct. I cannot remember where i read it , maybe on the ""other ""site!!!!"
I'm ok I buy mine in bottles! Lol
You don't shower in a bottle do you though Stalex!! last time i saw you you looked a bit big for that!!
"Bazz,  Baga, Calangute and Candolim are nothing like ""Beni"". As yet I have seen neither high rise apartments, cabaret clubs, 18-30 groups, stag groups, hen groups in North Goa and the biggest difference between the 2 places is that Benidorm beach is cleaned daily ;-)"
"Found it !!! in the Times of India news paper, ""sevear disruption "". is what they are saying .all along the CCB belt It was posted in ""other"" places"
I foresee brown water showers in the hotel!
ahhhhhh just had a message might be okay if you are on spring water .................................ummmmmmmmm
"I wonder how many hotels and eating places are on spring water though??. Well, at least there will be plenty of work for the water tankers!!."
"Quite a lot of hotels draw water from a well, think it will effect private apartments and guest house the most, that is apart from the road works. Can you imagine the chaos in Baga with the pavement been built on one side of the road and open trenches for pipe laying on the other"
"Well done !You've hi-jacked a posting so you can chat about something completely off topic.If you don't want to contribute to the original posting, thats fine.Open up a new posting so you can chat about this.Thanks for your co-operation guysBC"
"tony mate u sure push it,,,saying the uk,,police ,,,,,are as bad as the indian ones ,,come on,, no way,, thats imposs lol,, but i was thinking yer last post the one that got pulled//i wonder why,lol,,was very in yer face thing hows that shack owner doing,,, with the selling of the beach beds doing lol,,,only joking ,tony ,,thats before thay pull yer reply,,,,bye,Edited: 7 years ago "
