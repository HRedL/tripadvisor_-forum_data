How is this supposed to look like-stay in one hotel for 14 days? How are you supposed to go out and get supplies?
Obviously you have not heard of Room Service.24hrs in most reputable hotels.Don't forget to tip!
But what if you need to buy medication or something that is not provided by room service?
The guidelines will be posted here as soon as they are available.https:/…novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-resourcesIt was only announced today that any international traveller must self isolate on arrival. The details will follow.
"Why would you come to Australia to pay for a hotel room for two weeks and not do anything? In your shoes I would stay home, cheaper and easier in the long run."
"As I mentioned in another thread, effective almost immediately, only people who are coming on a WHV or student visa or reunion with family and loved ones will want to travel to Australia or NZ or any other country with similar entry restrictions. It is no longer about tourism."
I'm asking only in theory- why would I want to go somewhere to put others at risk and myself for huge fines?
"What are you asking? Are you planning on travelling?I dont think anyone would... as you say ""why would I want to go somewhere to put others at risk and myself for huge fines? "".....um.... thats the point ,dont travell, it puts you and others at risk, simple. Many of us have cancelled holidays, as others have said this is not about tourismanother thread you may wish to readhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g25…Edited: 10:49 am, March 15, 2020 "
The idea is to get people NOT to come.
"Why not just lock the country down and stop people from Europe (and other countries) entering? Similar to USA,Spain etc. This means cancelled flights and refunds for people. As things stands thousands of tourists will be out of pocket."
">>> As things stands thousands of tourists will be out of pocket<<<Yes it’s unfortunate, but in times like these, governments do not make decisions based on the financial wellbeing of tourists. They do so based on what they believe is best for their country and it’s residents."
"Ger is spot on about that. The current policy does zero to help tourists. Mandatory self quarantine is still a ""discretionary cancel"". If Australians want the border closed to all but Australian residents, petition your representatives. Because that is clearly not what they want. At least yet. It'd be easy for them to do that if they wanted to. And it would probably help everyone if they did.It's odd that there are threads and posts encouraging residents within Australia to travel here and there around the country, and being very friendly and positive in response to questions about domestic travel during the short term. But yet treating questions of tourists who might have limited options to cancel, or will go to extra lengths like renting a camper van or an isolated house on a beach to comply with self-isolation, as lepers who will contaminate the populace and should be publicly flogged and shamed for coming. It is entirely possible for tourists to practice social distancing if they have the right type of vacation planned.It makes me wonder if people truly don't understand the actual problem, or realize all things being equal, one case of option 1, if someone is infected, is a lot worse than 1 case of option 2. I think tourists it's better for travelers not to go to Australia in the short term. But I'm just saying.And before folks throw virtual tomatoes at me, I'm also as puzzled by the behavior of folks here in the US. The pictures of packed pubs and restaurants over the weekend, planning play dates for their kids and neighborhood block parties while schools are closed, or talking about taking the family to a highly populated beach area for a cheap vacation, defies all description and logic. They don't understand the actual problem and social distancing. Or don't think it applies to then and their actions, because they live here. :-( Believe me, I am far more worried about them, then the handful of random tourists who might make their way to the US in the next couple weeks. (Well, unless they had been on a cruise ship,)"
"post 9Agreepost 10Also agree but if so just stop all non Aus residents arriving, this will also allow travellers to claim on insurance. This wishy-washy border is open but self isolate is a nonsense policy that is giving the Aus tourist industry a bad name."
">>> But yet treating questions of tourists who might have limited options to cancel, or will go to extra lengths like renting a camper van or an isolated house on a beach to comply with self-isolation, as lepers who will contaminate the populace and should be publicly flogged and shamed for coming<<<I don’t see any questions being treated any differently than how majority of questions are approached on the Australian forum. If a traveller asks whether they should come here, and the conditions enforced by the government is as is, but the traveller can’t cancel (or don’t want to) for whatever reasons, what would you like us to say? Whatever is replied on a public forum, won’t change their circumstances"
"I think it’s rapidly getting to the point where all travel, including domestic In Australia is untenable. However, it’s the job of our Government and the expert panel of advisors to flag when an area needs to go into lock down. They have already spoken of restrictions on entering aged care facilities and remote communities. Aged people in remote communities have in addition apparently been taken to areas in the community away from others. At the moment in Australia it’s a balancing act between various harms. Severe economic impacts harm people too, and I am not talking about money I am talking about mental health and suicide. This virus looks like it will get savage here right in that time about 12 weeks after the fires when history has shown there is a spike in suicide. In much of the country we still have communities suffering from severe drought. Tourism operators are going to the wall too. So yes, people need to be very very wary of travel of any sort but it’s not a simple black and white all of the time. At least not yet in Australia."
Could they just ban anyone (non Aussie citizen) coming in who has booked for two weeks or less........those on a longer booking may self quarantine....those on two weeks or less if come in will be unlikely to self quarantine if they cannot get a refund.....if ypthey can get a refund may well not travel...
"Your suggestion sunnygooner wouldn’t help me at all. My trip is 4 weeks but I was meant to be joining an expedition cruise 3 nights after arriving. Not a clue What will get refunded at this stage. Got an email from the TA who booked the flights explaining not to contact them if my flights are after 1st April. They’re fully stretched dealing with folk stuck overseas or due to fly this week.Money is already gone. Getting anything even future credits will be a bonus. Time will tell.At this point I’m more concerned that family, friends and colleagues survive and the state the economy is going to be in. Those of us able to travel are the most fortunate of people. It’s a privilege not an unconditional right. I say this as a frequent traveller whose main interest in life is travelling or researching travelling.When I think what some Australians have already had to contend with - drought, horrific fire season, floods and now this. If all I lose is a few planned overseas trips, I’m doing ok."
"Yep, I sit looking at a burnt headland less than a kilometre away. People are still in shock, shaken to the core. Now this.I don’t get this half baked reaction of ScoMo’s. Either ban tourists or not. All I can think is he’s working up to it, firing a shot across the bows to discourage people from coming and perhaps a total ban is a couple of weeks away?"
"For all that the pollies say they are taking the advice of the experts, there's a lot of politics goes into public health. That's not to say that the Government isn't making the best decisions it can, just to acknowledge that there is a bigger picture that must be taken into account. You can't just look at even these crises through a completely narrow lens. ...and no, it's obviously true, that travellers losing their holiday and all that it cost, is very unfortunate but at the end of the day, its discretionary spending and those individuals are able to sustain that loss. Do you kill an industry to benefit individuals? Probably not."
Wow my 'discretionary spending' is definitely not going to be discretionary if I lose my job in the considerable shock waves that will be felt after this crisis! I'm a returning Australian who lives abroad going to help my Dad in Australia for 3 three weeks to find new accommodation. I can't stay with him to self-isolate because of his age and health problems but can't get a refund on my flights because I am not being refused entry.
"The Australian Government should close the border for tourists so they can claim on our travel insurance and aren't out of pocket. No one is expecting the Aussie Government to compensate tourists. My colleagues who have holidays booked to Spain, Florida etc over Easter all have confirmation that they will receive refunds due, whereas I will be out of pocket by £3,500 when realistically I can't go to Australia even though I would be allowed into the country, or would I? I have 3 hotels booked over a 2 week period, one in Sydney, one in Hamilton Island and one in Brisbane. All non-refundable at this stage. I also have an internal flight from Brisbane to Hamilton Island with Virgin Australia. I am assuming the situation will escalate over the next 2 weeks and flights will be cancelled or FCO will advise against travel to Oz and then my travel insurance will kick in. This is a big financial commitment for a 'once in a lifetime trip' so hoping common sense prevails."
"I return from Hawaii today and must self isolate despite feeling 100% healthy. Luckily I do this in my home and I receive full pay from my employer. I am not out of pocket however I understand this is not the case nor convenient for tourists but we must stop the spread of this virus somehow.Edited: 12:17 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"+1 for Post 18. And very best wishes to you & yours, AM.This is a difficult, distressing situation for everyone. I do feel very sorry for tourists, and I’d hate to have saved for a trip, only to be caught up in something like this, too. The fact remains though, the most far- reaching & serious financial & psychological ramifications are for businesses and locals in the countries affected, who lose their livelihoods, not for we who lose all or part of our holiday funds. Those people stand to lose everything, including the means to provide for themselves & their families. I think the government should close our borders to all but returning Australians, too. I can see it would be a very difficult decision, and create a lot of problems, but it would bring an end to the current confusion. And, as others have said, trigger refunds in many cases. It seems to be an inevitability & I think the sooner we get on with it, the better.We’re an island. We should take advantage of that to contain the wretched virus sooner than later, I think."
"Thanks Bokhara.I agree it would be better for Australia to impose a travel a ban for the protection of its residents not to,protect tourists. It’s not just up to Australia to do this. The U.K. is also an island and could equally be the ones that should be stopping travel instead of the advisory of stopping non essential travel. It’s the British Government’s job to be implementing measures that protect us Brits, so let’s stop whinging that Australia isn’t protecting us."
"""....Now this."" Yeah sasanqua. :-( I can just see a slight hint of the damage in the mountains here, I know from what I've read it's much worse than we can see from the suburbs, and I keep thinking of all the other areas and the homes and businesses. Best wishes from me too AmoMondo. Well said Bokhara."
Thanks Mac.
"We have similar regulations to you guys. Looks like we have our first deportation today of someone not self isolating. That should make future travel interesting.Today Air NZ cut 85% of trans Tasman flights. This follows massive cuts to long haul yesterday. Surely other airlines will be cutting flights to this part of the world so refunds will be necessary.We had 2 weeks planned for Noosa and accept thats not happening. Our preference is a credit of that fare as we will go when things settle down.Edited: 2:44 am, March 17, 2020 "
">>>Singapore has a good system where a visitor is required to produce proof of a pre-paid 14 day hotel booking on arrival, or be deported on the spot<<<Agree. This should be mandatory in Australia effective immediatelyEdited: 2:52 am, March 17, 2020 "
"Couldn’t agree more, KVE."
