"I saw online that Auschwitz released a statement saying ""Auschwitz tells people from COVID-19 countries to stay away"" me and my friends are american, and from the state of Minnesota where there has been no cases. ( a few states have cases) will we be allowed to visit our trip is in a few days."
"USA is country with confirmed COVID-19. Right? Do you hold Minnesota passport or US passport?Your question was answered at least three times at this forum today.Edited: 7:29 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"As of 28/02/20 America is not 1 of the countries included in the list that we have been asked not to take to Auschwitz.Edited: 2:37 am, February 29, 2020 "
"Is Australia on the list, Hoshi?"
No. Australia is fine
I guess the issue is when you would try to visit? A few months it could be better contained or even worse. So no telling in reality.

Got a trip to krakow in 2weeks from England.. will it be ok ?
"Banned citizens: China, Hongkong, Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore i Taiwan.@584caroline - I would more care about situation in your country than in Krakow. You will create additional risk to bring virus to Poland.Edited: 11:10 am, March 01, 2020 "
Are the tourists spots open? Heard they were closing museum’s etc
"Maybe in your country but not in Poland. Please do not spread the panic and false infos at this forum.Business in Poland as usual except 2 weeks home-office for employees coming from infected countriesEdited: 12:02 pm, March 01, 2020 "
Wouldn’t spread panic when I’m only asking a question for when we get to krakow. That’s the idea of the forum. I’m just a tourists who is looking forward to going to Poland and don’t want anything to spoil it. Why you think I could possibly cause a panic is beyond me.But thank you for your replies
"""Heard they were closing museum’s etc"" >> sample of spreading a panic and stupid rumors"
Can you tell us where you heard they were closing museums.
I heard UK left EU. I heard Brexit-20 impact would me much greater than COVID-19 impact ... Sorry ... couldn't resist this one ...;-)

Funny....Do you hold Minnesota passport or US passport?
I'm sure it is not able to be visited by now.
