just been reading a nightmare of a story about a couple in Bali who had a bike accident & the costs of medical care etc involved.can anyone reccommend a good insurance company in Aus. to get good cover through?
"Look into MBF and Medibank (or your own health care providers offering). Stick to the mainstream ""big name"" Australian insurers in any case, and make yourself fully aware of what they DON'T offer/cover. "
"Hi.We took out Medibank travel insurance on our 1st trip to Thailand and thankfully didn't need to use it. Since then we have a 12 month/multi-trip Covermore policy but you can get a single trip policy. Comparing the benefits it seems to be good value and I took notice of how much assistance they gave when there were protests and flight cancellations in Thailand last year- they appeared to be assisting appropriately and updated their website with info. for ppl in Thailand.Also if you search Covermore on TA, there are good reports from other ppl. Hope this helps.Nat"
"Nat :)sounds v. good to me!thanks for the info, much appreciated."
Hi again.I forgot to mention that they did provide cover during the protests when many other insurers didn't.That was also one of the reasons for us insuring with them as opposed to others.Nat
"Before you buy insurance cover, check that the policy covers civil unrest (civil insurrection). This will cover you should any future protests occur in Thailand that impact on your travel plans.I looked in Medibank Private's cover and it didn't cover this. I found that QBE Tour safe travel insurance did. It is a bit more expensive but I thihk it will be well worth it if anything happened."
"G'day Redback... I checked out QBE's Tour Safe TI T&C's and found this clause;We will not pay under any circumstances if:Your claim arises because you did not follow advice in the mass media of any government or other official body’s warning:• of a strike, riot, bad weather, civil commotion or contagious disease;• of a likely or actual Epidemic or Pandemic (such as H5N1 Avian influenza);• of a threat of an Epidemic or Pandemic (such as H5N1 Avian influenza) that requires the closure of a country's borders;• of an Epidemic or Pandemic that results in you being quarantined.__________________________________________It seems, like any insurer, the choice of when they will or will not honour a claim, is entirely one of their choosing."
"Yeah - but if you pre-paid and pre-booked before any such warning was made, you are covered."

You could try AAMI . Have used them but have not made a claim yet.
"Personally, I just book everything (flights and accommodation) on my Westpac gold Visa card and I get free travel insurance. I figure it's Westpac, not some little insurance company I've never heard of, that has to count for something. I've read the policy booklet and I'm happy with the cover it provides. It covers me, and any family I travel with, for all the major concerns - public liability, theft or loss, hospitilisation, airfares etc."
