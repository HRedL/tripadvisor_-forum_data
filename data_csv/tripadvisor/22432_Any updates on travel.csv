Is there a good place to find updates regarding when the islands will open back up to visitors? I have a trip planned for fall and would like to keep updated if I will need to change my trip. Would it just be the same Info New Zealand is putting out?

thank you exactly what I was looking for
Another two good resources are the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands fb page and the Cook Islands News fb page.
