"Hello!I am trying to get back from China to my home country and the cheapest and easiest way to do so is to transit through LAX. I am a US citizen, so will be allowed into the USA but do not know if I'll be allowed to reach my final destination (which happens to be outside of the USA) as scheduled or if I must after 14 days of ""self-quarantine"". I'm desperate for any answers and/or knowledge on the matter.Thank you in advance!!"
And what is your home country? And what flight will you take from China?
TA is the wrong place to ask this.Check official sources.
"Try reading this:https:/…You'll be flying in from the nation deemed highest risk and directed to a special station inside the airport. You'll have your temperature taken, be observed for symptoms and asked about exactly where you've been etc. Depending on where you have been in China, you may be quarantined for 14 days (and unable to travel obviously), even if you have no symptoms.I keep hearing that quarantined persons are being charged for their own costs of quarantine, but have no official word on that - maybe someone else knows.So the key thing has to do with why you went to China, and where in China you went once there. I assume that China keeps records as well. If you didn't go to Hubei Province, and have no symptoms (which you can't know right now), you will be able to transit.It's a difficult time for you to travel, but hopefully that helps."
"It is not only Hubei though. Even though Wuhan and Hubei were the presumed origin spot....emphasis presumed....there are other hot spots in China.You said that LAX is the cheapest/fastest suggesting that there are other paths home. The U.S. is not exactly a hive of competency in dealing with this, including at top governmental levels, but the instinct is decidedly border protection and believing that the enemy is without and not also within.Edited: 12:42 pm, March 10, 2020 "
Health policies can change without notice. Contact the State Department for the latest news. There is no way any of us can answer this question.
"Guys, another first-time poster asking a vague generic question about the latest media hysteria story. I wish TA would flag these obviously bogus posts. We shouldn’t engage them."
"To OP, I don't think there is any current quarantine requirements for US citizens who have not been to Hubei, unless on entry you show symptoms. This is the current situation as far as I know.I don't know what reply #6 is talking about. We are all a first time poster once."
