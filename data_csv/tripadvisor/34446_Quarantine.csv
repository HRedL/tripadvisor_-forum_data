"Hi, just heard travellers from spain will have to quarantine on return to the uk does this apply to the canarys or mainland spain?"
Not yet announced.
"It was announced live on ITV News at six as breaking news that from midnight anyone returning from Spain has to quarantine for 14 days.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53540691Edited: 2:48 pm, July 25, 2020 "
Yes it was just on sky news. Gutted due to go in september
Scotland has also re-introduced the quarantine from midnight tonight.
"Canaries not included in the FCO advice.....From 26 July, the FCO advises against all non-essential travel to mainland Spain based on the current assessment of COVID-19 risks. Only the Canary Islands (Tenerife, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, La Palma, La Gomera, El Hierro and La Graciosa) and Balearic Islands (Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, and Formentera) are exempt from the FCO advice against all non-essential international travel.This advice is based on evidence of increases in cases of COVID-19 in several regions, but particularly in Aragon, Navarra and Catalonia (which include the cities of Zaragoza, Pamplona and Barcelona).The FCO is not advising those already travelling in Spain to leave at this time. Travellers should follow the advice of the local authorities on how best to protect themselves and others, including any measures that they bring in to control the virus. If you are returning from Spain (including from the Balearics and Canaries) on or after 26 July you will be required to quarantine on your return to the UK, but the FCO is not advising you to cut short your visit. You should contact your tour operator or airline if you have any questions about your return journey.PHE are continuing to monitor the situation in the Balearic and Canary Islands closely. Travellers there should continue to check this advice regularly."
It’s saying you will still have to quarantine if returning from Canary Islands
Yeah but exempt from the essential travel so trips will still go ahead. It’ll put a lot of people in a difficult spot. Go and quarantine or lose the money.
TUI have said they won’t send anyone where you have to quarantine on return.
It will be interesting to see what they do then.........

This should not include canary islands as they dont have an increase!
"The Canaries don’t yet have an increase, but during the summer a lot of people from the mainland go there as it is cooler - have they stopped travel from within Spain? If not then it is likely the rate of infection may rise."
"If after Spain I go to Portugal for a week, should I still have to quarentine for 14days once return to the UK or does in this case the quarentine last for a week only?"
I thought you had to isolate for 14 days after returning from Portugal as there is no air bridge?If you went to France after Spain then you only do the remaining days in quarantine in the UK.
You have to self isolate for 14 days from Portugal that has never changed
Balearics and Canaries have same quarantine rules on re-entry to UK. Heard from my daughter who lives in Ibiza this morning and she said airport is crazy. Lots of people having terminated holidays early and getting out. There is a fear there that Spain will go back into a lockdown situation very soon. Not looking good for travel to any part of Spain atm.
"Think i might aswell right this year off , gran canaria in march was cancelled after getting through to departure lounge,las vegas in july was cancelled even though virgin holidays demanded £3,660 , booked a friends appartment for september on calleta and boris has now changed the rules , cancelled iceland in october rather than pay £800 on 26th july, iceland not letting us in and hotel is closed , malaga in november hanging in the balance , Only thing i have left is the big blue hotel with my grandkids in blackpool in august for 3 days, never in a million years did i think i would be looking forward to blackpool for 3 days lol.Edited: 3:16 am, July 26, 2020 "
Yes!
"Sidney I know our holiday to Mexico end of April was cancelled and now left in this ridiculous predicament no doubt for our Fuerteventura holiday 19th September as we made the unfortunate choice of Ryanair who will not refund unless the plane is literally grounded and even then not without a fight! I reckon that'll be £480 down the pan but at least booking.com are excellent and we can cancel upto 1 day before. The uncertainty makes me wanna just cancel now but I begrudge giving Ryanair a free £480 gift! Hubby reckoned it's over half to move the flights to 2021 and then when?!? Could be looking at throwing more good money after bad. We just had this week off and went to hunstanton for the day, beautiful weather, really enjoyed our day trip and plenty of space to social distance, think that'll be the only sand we might see this year sadly !"

@21 nice informational link...hopefully it'll happen...
Yes fingers crossed. We only booked last week.
What a nightmare! I’m due to fly out tomorrow and have no idea what to do!
"The inconsistency between the FCO advice not to travel to mainland Spain and the quarantine applying to all of Spain is a nightmare for anyone who has a holiday booked to either the Canaries or the Balearics. The various governments of the UK need to get their acts together on this, it's an apalling situation.Edited: 9:24 am, July 26, 2020 "
"I know this goes a bit against the current, but me and the wife's on about bringing our flight forward from early Sept, to late August (free flight change at moment)..If it's still all happening, we'll move it to later in September (or whatever).With the quarantine as it is at the moment, we'd be unable to go...(work, not be happy), so trying to second guess it I suppose (although who'd have guessed last night's quarantine decision)?.If the numbers keep going up and Spain goes into a total Lockdown again, well that'll be it..."
"if and its a big if,my partner and i have to quarentine when we get back from our september holiday corralejothen thats what we will do.all through the lockdown in the uk we have both worked,i have more chance of catching covid in england than the canaries.i have delivered steel all over the country a lot of it to companies who make and supply hospitals with beds, ventilator stands and such.my partner is a key workerwe just get on with things.fed up with people saying that we shouldnt of booked to go away while this pandemic is on going,but we booked this holiday in feb while we where in corralejo.did the goverment tell me i had to quarentine when i delivered steel to leicester,blackburn,and other towns and cities who have had more positive covid people than the whole of the canaries.sorry people the goverment have got this so wrong,if everyone who has died had died of covid not with covid then fair enough.as long as we are allowed to fly we will be there,sorry for the long post but begining to get fed up with all this nonsense now"
Trevor @27 totally agree
"It’s not clear though, I read this earlier but re read it and it’s about non essential travel and not about quarantine? I think?"
"you are allowed to travel for holidays to the canary isles,not mainland spain,but you must quarantine 14 days on your return,man city are exempt from the 14 day quarantine when they play real madrid,how does that work? why our goverment just didnt impose bans on certain areas with high covid rates .and lets be honest here our infection rate if the stats are true are higher than spains"
"With you Trevor, excellent posts."
"I agree, Trevor.Provided the FCO advice not to travel doesn't include the Canaries (and therefore insurance remains valid) then we'd be willing to put up with the stupid quarantine requirement. I realise that not everyone can do so, due to work commitments and the like, so I hope our government see sense and remove the quarantine requirement for the islands.Edited: 3:30 am, July 27, 2020 "
It seems this pandemic has turned us into a nation of curtain twitchers if social media is anything to go by.
"Trevor our infection rate is not higher than spain - in fact spain's is currently more thna double ours.The gov explained yesterday that they look at cases per 100,000 look at his link and the figures and you see whyhttps:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueea"
"Trevor, me and my husband are in the same situation, both key workers and have worked throughout, i work in a school and he is an engineer going to 8 houses a day. My kids have gone to school throughout lockdown. We will be in less contact with people if we go to Corralejo. And if we have to quarantine when we get home then we will, it will actually be a nice break after working flat out for months. We haven’t had a holiday in 3 years, unless our flights are cancelled we will be going."
All non essential travel now includes canary islandsGUTTED
"There really is no logic to this, another appalling decision by the UK government."
well very disapointed in the stupid decision by the fco.but if ryanair decide to fly and we all know ryanair do as they please i am tempted to go.its only advice by the fco and not a law.
"Uk promoting stay cations,,, totally gutted due to fly out on the 15th Aug"
"Trevor, we are also booked with Ryanair, only issue we will have will be our travel insurance will be invalid. We are still planning on going unless Ryanair decides not to fly."
"Uk promoting stay cations,we tried one in may and guess what that was cancelled.donnalsmith we are in the same position about travel insurance,we dont fly untill sept 11th so things could change by then,but if not i can not see us not going.,my partner is worried in case we get stuck out there,but cross that bridge if it happens"
Jet2 now advising passengers not to go to airports for flights to anywhere in Spain - assume that includes Fuerteventura.
Jet 2 going out empty to fly everyone home again
Is Easyjet still flying to Fuerteventura from Stansted?
"Leandro-although not Stansted,our flight with EJ departs from Bristol tomorrow at the stated time.Unless contacted by EJ to say the flight is cancelled, we intend to be aboard."
"I agree that this is an illogical decision by our government.They announce on Sunday that there is no restriction on travelling to the Spanish islands, then on Monday they recommend against it. Barmy.I would recommend caution in travelling without insurance though. If your carrier suddenly decides to follow government guidance you could be left with no flight home - or a very expensive one."
"#43, I'd take what Jet2 say with a large pinch of salt.In March they were busy flying people abroad and then suddenly cancelled their flights, leaving many people (including us) stranded abroad.What they say and what they do are two very different things."
I'm happy to pay for insurance.Is there any insurance company recommended for this current situation?
Try battleface I am looking into this right now and seems promising.
Read the Which magazine website the most comprehensive source of current travel insurance information in one place (well that I have found anyway) ...https:/…
"Thanks for the link Digger, my annual insurance is with Nationwide, seems it’s about the best."
I don’t think any insurance cover for this situation The main Covid cover recommended by Martin Lewis last month - Southdowns - covers loads on Covid but the small print still says it’s all invalid if you travel against fco advice I think they all have it in their small print
Personally I think once the FCO advises against travel to a particular country it would be wise not to go. As well as the insurance issue there must be questions about how one would be repatriated in the event of further lockdowns in the foreign country.
We are supposed to fly to corralejo in 27th aug and I think they are gonna have an air bridge and no quarantine back here
"The wife and I had a trip booked for April which we had to cancel, Changed our flights to August 26th from Bristol and had an Airbnb booked,Was just beginning to get excited when they brought the 14 day quarantine in.The wife and I are both frontline workers and have not had a break since last Nov in Corralejo. I was not confident this 14 day quarantine would be lifted in time for us to fly so I have changed flights with Easyjet and we are booked for 10 nights on Kefalonia, booked a lovely hotel in the capital Argostoli. If by any chance the government does a uturn in the next 8 days I will be changing my flight back to Fuerteventura and cancelling the hotel in Kefalonia."
