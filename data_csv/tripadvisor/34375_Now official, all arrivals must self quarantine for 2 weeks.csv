The government has just announced that all international arrivals must self quarantine for 2 weeks (including Australians returning home). Probably answers a lot of the questions about whether holidays should be cancelled/postponed.
Good.I feel for those non residents who are currently in transit to Aus but we need to try and slow this and protect the vulnerable in our communities.
what the hell does 'self isolate' even look like for visitors?come here but don't do anything/go anywhere/eat anywhere but your hotel room...I understand returning Aussies need to stay home but ....able - you're the go-to for medical advice (since I'd imagine your OH GP would have good advice) .. what does this mean
"Thmoore it will be messy no doubt, particularly with most visitors only planning on staying in their original destination for a few days before moving on. I’m guessing people will either turn around and get back on the next plane home (don’t even know the logistics of that one) or have to book their original hotel for 2 weeks. But then how do they get supplies etc??? Reality will be most visitors won’t fully isolate at all."
"In reality it's self explanatory ... you are supposed to stay inside, limit contact with others to under 5 mins at a distance. My dog would not be happy not getting walked. How this works for visitors I have no idea ... they would have to stay in a hotel for 14 days? And it would be unserviced? Food would have to be delivered ... and trays collected by people in protective clothing ... to us it sounds impossible. Visitors should just not come or get onto the next return flight home. My brother in law is a ships captain, they are looking for somewhere to park the ship for at least a month while all cruises are cancelled ... it's really getting weird."
A difficult thing to do for tourists but a good idea to protect people in Australia with compromised immune systems.
"While it would be hard to enforce the quarantine on returning residents, the travel itinerary of any visitor will basically provide the control in most cases. If your return flight is in ten days then they can just stop you at the border. Even if you have a 3 weeks trip planned, you will still need to show that you have accommodation for the first 14 days at the same place near the port of entry. That is just about impossible for anyone traveling in the next few days and after that, why would anyone one bother unless it is for WHV, long term study or reunion of family and loved ones."
Poor Amomondo ... :(
gonna be a big ships parking area needed somewhere out in the middle of the ocean - I think most returning Aussies will understand the need to quarantine themselves but it does rely on people's honesty and since far too many people cant do the right thing with TP the whole thing becomes probelmatic I suspect.not sure if wierd even comes close to what's on the horizonbe safe everyone
"I think it’s a good idea - but how to police it?As others have noted, it’s easier for residents to stay home than for visitors, many of whom have only a fortnight or so planned for their trip. Leaving aside the logistics for the visitors, I suspect the financial implications for both will see a number of people not complying.Able: I’m disappointed for AM too. She had a great trip planned and we had another road trip in the pipeline, for Qld this time. Next year! It’s a very sad situation for visitors, locals and our businesses alike - but we have to do whatever we can to minimise the impact. I’m hoping our being an island might help us a bit.All the best everyone."
@ Post 12. Shouldn't be a problem.There are plenty of Dorrie Evans around as well as narks and scabs to also assist the authorities.

"Well, I have spent the last three hours canceling my Australia reservations. So that is at least one less troublesome tourist underfoot you'll need to worry about policing!I'm very fortunate to only be out about $500 for airline related fees, for the entire 5 week trip. Particularity since my flight was just a few days off. My very deep empathy for those that are in worse situations, and also for the impact to so many businesses and livelihoods. One of the ladies when I canceled broke down and started crying. She apologized but said this is devastating them and all day it's been call after call. And then I started crying too. :-(Thank you to everyone who answered my many questions in the past nine months I'd been planning this trip. I've really appreciated it. Take care and stay safe."
Are you already in Australia?
"Leavingagain Re home ... you are supposed to be separate ... so if you have two bathrooms, bedrooms etc and almost zero contact ... she would have to provide meals and leave them at a door. No, you cannot go on a run ... you STAY AT HOME. Re the doctor ... call the surgery and explain the situation, do not go to a doctors surgery unannounced.Edited: 3:06 am, March 15, 2020 "
CTBreezes ... one day in the not too distant future we will all be back to normal ... see you then (fingers crossed)
"Thank you to everyone being so understanding with this! We hope to see you in Australia soon :)Edited: 3:21 am, March 15, 2020 "
How long will this policy last? Is it indefinite?
Leaving again ... well only one of you can go in the kitchen ... and you can't prepare food for her so unless you have two kitchens ...
NSW Health guidance on self quarantinehttps:/…hubei-contacts-and-travellers.aspx
"That’s tough for everyone, CT Breezes. I can understand how upset you and the person cancelling your booking would be. Hope you can re-schedule when all this is over.I was thinking equally of locals as of tourists in wondering how the “ self isolation” would/ could be monitored. We have had instances of people coming home & going to work, despite not feeling well, because they had casual jobs ( no sick leave or holiday pay)."
"dytokyo ... great link. will bookmark that, thanks."

It states for the trip home by any sort of transport you need to wash your hands and wear a mask ... you must wear a mask whenever in company of other people and using public areas like apartment hallways and lifts.
"So sorry to the many, many forum visitors and Aussies alike who are caught up in this crazy situation. In years to come, we'll sit on our veranda and down a cold one while reminiscing the crazy year that was 2020. :) Stay safe and be close to your families."
"@croman. Hope you have a safe trip home!Wear a mask on the way home.Edited: 4:12 am, March 15, 2020 "
Bound to have an Earthquake in there somewhere..... Perish the thought.
Don't tell me there is no Santa in December !
"Will every traveller then be issued with a mask on arrival?What’s to stop tourists just continuing with their Australian itinerary anyway? Who’d know? Who’d stop them?Edited: 6:50 am, March 15, 2020 "
"That was exactly my point, sasanqua. Same with locals. Who would know, apart from their work colleagues & family?"
I would hope that everyone understands to do the right thing for mankind and not themselves at this point. I know I would be absolutely devastated to do anything to worsen conditions! There probably does need to be some sort of monitoring or checking in though.
"Fines for not self isolating are up to $25,000 ... https:/…12045390"
"Well not j expected at all.It needed to be done and may actually now assist me postponing until May 2021.im just putting all the contact information and costs into a spreadsheet in the next few days and will give it a week or so before I start bugging companies about rearranging. Let the airlines, insurers and other companies deal with folk due to travel this month.I’m hoping it will be all over for all our sakes well before Christmas.It’s pretty close to home for me now. My brother has the symptoms since returning from Tenerife. Symptoms are mild and he’s self isolating. Has to report back to NHS call line in a week or sooner if he gets back.The toilet paper panic has well and truly spread here now. Folk also bulk buying pasta, UHT milk and flour. I. Fairly sure more than half stock piling flour have never baked in their lives!Stay safe all. Will miss seeing you!"
"Coming from Norfolk Island, will I have to self isolate?"
Thats a good step. Now the problem with most of us will be airlines are giving free rescheduling but the journey should start before 31Aug20. It would have been nice had that made it till 31Dec20. By then we all hope much of this pandamic would have settled. Wish for good health for all.
Does anybody know if there are places that travellers can self-quarantine in Brisbane? Hotels? How do they get food?
Have you heard of room service?
"What is the story for transit travelers?If someone is booked to spend 1 night before flying onward, can they leave after that one day of some sort of isolation?"
"You would be very safe at the South Pole, svg."
"CTBreeze you did the right thing to cancel. I heard that the Strahan has canceled their boat and tomorrow the train. I managed to move our trip home about five days earlier which was a royal pain to figure out and do. Cannot talk to airlines. Will deal with them when this crisis is better under control. We leave Friday for Melbourne and Sat for SFO and pray nothing changes to keep us in Australia. Our fear is having to stay in Melbourne, not a place I would want to be. We will have to quarantine three weeks when we arrive home. We can deal with that and pray we get home without getting the virus. Good luck everyone."
"Well I see Qantas are stopping flights soon, and now foreigners can't travel anyway."
It absolutely does need to be removed! And can we please stop posting stickies about things that will be temporary.
As of saturday midnight (Mar 28) all arriving passengers will be placed in enforced quarantine in hotels and similar and the ADF will assist with monitoring compliance.https:/…12095898
Weak government. This should have been implemented a week ago. People are still flouting the law. They don’t care. This will result in more deaths.
This will decimate the Tourism sector and cost many thousands of jobs.II was considering traveling to WA in early 2021 but will have to reconsider
"Ryan - most inciteful commentary, based on the fact your holiday plans will be affected. The sector is already decimated starting from the bushfires."
"According to many press agencies, those that are being quarantined on arrival are being treated dreadfully. Rooms without windows and pre packed meals that you might get in prison"
"Reports I've seen have had quarantined guests commenting on their lovely harbour view. It's obviously going to be a mixed experience depending on the property. It's not fun for anyone to be confined in a rooom for 2 weeks. It's even less enjoyable being in ICU on a venitlator. What's your solution to the problem Ryan? You seem to think things should be done differently.... and can someone please remove this from the list of sticky postsEdited: 12:48 am, April 01, 2020 "
