"We booked a vacation for early March to Cancun and It's one of those all-inclusive package. Now with all the coronavirus situation, we are worried whether we should go or not :(... I want to hear your thought on this please!Another question is that in case we want to cancel, Does Expedia refund us or at least give us credit for future bookings? Any experience there?"
"No idea why this would concern you since Mexico has reported no cases.As far as Expedia, they show you the cancellation terms when you book so I would check there."
"We’re here now. Nothing to worry about. Even at the airport, no one had masks or anything. It’s fine."

"There has not been a travel warning issued to Mexico so Expedia probably is not going to do anything besides possibly give you credit for a future vacation, but I wouldn’t count on it"
"Have to second what Robert said. What information would make you think Mexico travel is a concern? Don't listen to the media hype, read the facts and you will see there is nothing to worry about"
"No confirmed cases in Mexico yet, but unless Mexico enacts a quarantine or denies entry to anyone who has recently visited mainland China, it's only a matter of time."
"I think it’s too early to say what will be in a month. We also have a trip planned. It’s not an issue of Mexico. It’s all travel. Will things become more contained or will it become a pandemic. Will the virus, already far more contagious than was originally thought, stay as it is or mutate into something more grave. I have no plans to alter any travel plans anywhere, but would not hesitate to do so for health and safety if factual information supported that decision, regardless of any cancellation policies."
"The new coronavirus will likely spread world wide eventually and the major health organizations and individual governments will alert potential travelers to any eventual recommendations required. If you're worried about the virus, change your plans, however it may find you closer to home quicker than it does in and around Cancun, Mexico, if at all. There's already 6 States with actual and 36 States with potential cases being researched in the U.S. as I write this. Currently, as per the CDC, there's no reported cases in Mexico but the virus hardly is worried about borders. Below is a link from the U.S. CDC: https:/…locations-confirmed-cases.html"
"I hear Uber temporarily deactivated accounts. And the man with corona virus was in Mexico City prior to his arrival to LA. This was 1/30/2020. Time will tell if it spreads. I also have flights booked for the end of Feb for Cancun. Sort of paranoid.Edited: 12:35 am, February 08, 2020 "
Interesting article:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020…
Downtown thanks for posting the very interesting article.
"That is an interesting article. However, from people that I know who are working directly on this particular virus, one group w sequencing and another w developing a vaccine, what makes it exceptional and exceptionally contagious is its survivability on solid surfaces. While most only survive a few hours, this one is surviving for days. Hand washing is good, of course. Disinfecting shared surfaces is also prudent. They are unsure about the efficacy of masks in transmission prevention."
"Seasonal influenza (the flu) is much more of a danger to all than the novel coronavirus at this point. Washing your hands is a must, do it, and do it thoroughly. First thing I do when getting off the plane is to head to the bathroom and scrub my hands. Forget 20 seconds, I wash for about 45. The flying tube is a cesspool of awfulness. Nothing proves that more than the stuff we've seen left behind in seatbacks and crap still on trays."
"There's a good chance I may catch a bit of the Coronavirus while in Mexico. Likely 6 or 7 bottles on the beach with some limes and maybe a shot or 3 of Tequila. HA!Seriously though, Chances of contracting this virus are slim at this time. People and society get so worked up over every little thing anymore. If you are worried about it you should most likely save your money and stay home. You probably won't be able to enjoy yourself as you'll be worried about something. Did you clean the litter box before you left?"
"We are in Cancun now in an all inclusive resort. Initially I was concerned about whether we should go on our vacation. Just traveling in general. After being here I realized we definitely should have cancelled our trip. Mexico is one of the countries allowing travel from China. Yes there is a case in Mexico where a man travelled to Wigan, China in December. The Coronavirus is spreading fast in China. There were about 50 that came from China yesterday. There's a 14 day incubation period. I've read articles stating that you can get it person to person or animal to person. Yet I've read that it survives about 3-4 hours off the body on surfaces. Mexico is claiming to not do the same thing they did with the Swine Flu. People are are being ""tested"" for the Coronavirus. Yet there's picture of a man leaving from getting tested wearing a mask that is not a N95 mask. You would think with the virus spreading so fast the resorts would kick up the hygiene & be concerned with cross contamination. Overall our resorts is very clean. But they put our silverware on the placemats where everyone puts their hands etc. In the end it's all about money not lives."
We have a trip planned for August and I'm a little worried. I know that August is months away and I've been trying not to worry about it but I've been thinking about this more lately. I guess we will just have to wait and see how things play out. I remember when the Zika Virus surfaced in 2017. We were so concerned that we didn't travel internationally that year. I'm hoping for the best.
"If I may ask...serious question here...why are you all more scared of this Coronavirus than you are of the flu? Your chances of contracting the flu are far higher, and the death rate of the flu is much higher. Yet I am sure the flu never crossed your mind as something that would make you cancel your trip. Let's all think about that for a moment....then maybe you will see how blown out of proportion this whole Coronavirus thing is."
+1 to GP Girl.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Coronavirus is far more contagious than flu, though certainly not more deadly unless it mutates. There no reason to cancel a trip because of it at this juncture. Watching it’s spread and making a determination for later travel is not at all unreasonable."
"I would not worry about it. Serious cases are limited to China and so far, containement is working, despite a few cases here and there. We just booked a holiday in Cancun from March 13 to 23 and very much look forward to enjoying the Mexican sun! Another important point is that influenza, also a coronavirus, is temperature sensitive. Mexico is probably too warm for cov-19."
"Same boat as most. Have an all-inclusive in Cancun set up for March 5-10. Now we gotta worry (kinda) about a dang Corona Virus - before, during and after our trip! I'm planning on a proposal so I'm already stuck in my own head!!My take is that we have no idea what's going on in China. Glad to see it hasn't exploded elsewhere so I'm cautiously optimistic we won't get it. That's about as good as it's gonna get I guess."
"I didn’t read all the responses so if I repeat my apologies. For me my concern is the airplane. I am flying to Miami International on a Boeing 777 in March and the only thing that has me concerned is where has that airplane flown in the last trip and was someone infected? Good questions to ask that would be impossible to know. We know corono virus can live on surfaces and been reported thru recirculated air. I am not canceling my trip but I am taking plenty of Lysol wipes to literally wipe my entire seat and tray off, I might even wear a mask. Airplane is my concern not Mexico or any American city yet."
"Don't worry about the air on a plane. Here is a article that explains how air is refreshed on aircraft. https:/…Once on the plane, wipe down the armrests, seat belt buckle and the tray table with wipe. Use hand sanitizer and stay hydrated. My understanding is masks don't do much to protect you. They protect others from you."
"At AIs, your biggest concern would be buffet lines for all germs. As a rule, I wash my hands or sanitize before entering the buffet as a courtesy to others and after before I eat. I avoid buffers wherever possible too."
I would bring a mask to wear on the plane to protect yourself since it's in a confined space but no case is reported in Mexico.
i have a same concern too. How is your decision going?
"Medical experts say that masks prevent those with colds from spreading itBut does not protect you if you are healthy. Just wash your hands and use disinfectant wipesRemember, no cases have been found in MXDuckbilled - great adviceEdited: 7:01 pm, February 22, 2020 "
"Just because a place hasn't reported it, doesn't mean they don't HAVE any cases. China didn't report it at first, if you recall. So, reporting depends upon recognition that it exists, having the infrastructure for public health, and then for having the transparency and guts to admit that it is there. That said, still seems like this month is safe to go. If you buy travel insurance, make sure it covers cancellation for outbreaks, and also trip extension or extrication for the same in case you get stuck. We purchase and travel with N-95 mask normally (nurse here) for those fun times when we get assigned next to super sick people on planes, but now I won't hesitate to bring some extra in the event we need them to get home. Those fabric masks won't help you. Wear them very tight and get as good of a seal as you can. Don't touch your face. Wash your hands like it's a religion. I also always take a digital oral thermometer in my bag."
We are traveling mid April and I fear that by then this would have spread even more. We are flying from lax with a layover in Houston. We are staying at an all inclusive and it makes me nervous with so many travelers sharing a small space. I’m hoping we notice no cases survive that heat but the traveling within airport makes me nervous. We are flying with a 1 year old who won’t enjoy wearing a mask the entire flight.
"It’s late now, but travel insurance can cover you fir “cancellation for any reason“ prior to departure. It can be costly depending on number in your party traveling. I never bought it years ago but do now because of my age and examples like family members becoming ill,etc."
Did they do health screening at the Cancun airport? like checking body temp?
Cancún...what exposure to coronaviris?
"""Did they do health screening at the Cancun airport? like checking body temp?""They do not do that at the airport here at this time.""Cancún...what exposure to coronaviris?""No reported cases here in Cancun or any other part of Mexico."
"We just came back from there had no issues other than some wind, we had a great time. Mexico seems to be safe."
"The travel insurance company I am with said that if I choose to cancel my trip, Cancun in March, because of coronavirus and have not been told officially that it is not safe to travel by travel company or WHO government etc, I will not be able to claim a refund."
We are also going on the 7th March but we own our own Condo in Playa Del Carmen. We have been talking to some of our friends regularly and they say no worries as of yet.
"Myself, we are going the 6th of March and return the 12th. I’d be more worried about US Airports. We’ll sanitize everything on the plane, seat, headrest, armrest, and tray. Take wipes and sanitizer. In Cancun not even going to think about it much. Going out away from the resort a few times. Make the most of it, nobody wants to get sick, don’t let fear rule. You’re on vacation. Sure, do the little things to help prevent it, but enjoy yourself and have a great time."
"I am in the same boat, and considering a cancellation. Can you imagine if 1 person reports a fever at the resort you are at? It would be a 14 day lockdown.Not sure what to do, but going out of the country now seems a little risky."
"What I can say is this...prior to our trip I worried about everything (the internet has a way of doing that to a persons mind). I worried about local cartel violence, corrupt police, taxi cab kidnappings, robbery, travellers diarrhea, hepatitis, dengue fever, the list goes on. But once we arrived in Cancun, I felt like a fool. It is a beautiful place and we had such a fantastic time. Of course you still use your common safety smarts like you would at home, but I had such a feeling of mental peace and happiness there. I had the realization that the internet can be a really really bad place for one's mental health. Since coming back home I stopped reading the news online and do not frequent certain sites nearly as much as I used to (if at all). I stopped googling every fear and worry. I cannot tell you how much better I am mentally. I watch my local 6 o'clock news once a week - that's all I need."
"#40 - ""Can you imagine if 1 person reports a fever at the resort you are at? It would be a 14 day lockdown."". Who exactly would be locking the resort down? This makes no sense at all."
"I am also booked into an all inclusive Riu Caribe for two weeks in early March.I can tell you this, I am gonna' go and enjoy myself just in case this turns into the world ending virus people are saying! I wanna' go out partying!!!!!!"
As long as they lock my resort down at the end of my two weeks and I get two more weeks comped I'll just stay!!!!
"ugg. We have also discussed the ramifications of the virus and the possibility of it being there. I'm still 3 weeks away and planning on going with the wife & kids. That will change if there is a breakout.My change now is traveling with wipes, sanitizer, etc and going to add masks to the luggage if someone looks (sounds) suspect on the flight (for any sickness)."
"""- ""Can you imagine if 1 person reports a fever at the resort you are at? It would be a 14 day lockdown."".""You're assuming that the resorts are tracking the health of their guests. They're not.If someone has a fever, they have a fever. The resort may ask if you'd like to see a doctor (on your dime) but they aren't going to be kicking down the resort. And that's only if you sought someone from the resort out to tell them. They aren't monitoring people in that way. And likely that's not going to change unless and until we have cases reported here. Mexico is still at 0. Right now there's nothing extra being done in regards to screening. People come here on vacation and get sick sometimes. That's a fact of life. So I don't think you need to worry about a lockdown."
"Breaking news ,1000 guests in a hotel in Tenerife put into quarantine."
"I certainly hope resorts are putting protocols in place just in case. Zero cases now, but that could change on a dime. The regional health department and the hotel industry need to be prepared and ready to act."
"""I am also booked into an all inclusive Riu Caribe for two weeks in early March.I can tell you this, I am gonna' go and enjoy myself just in case this turns into the world ending virus people are saying! I wanna' go out partying!!!!!!"" This!!! I have an equal chance of getting this virus at home, traveling for work, or vacationing in Cancun."
"Update on the Tenerife hotel H10 Adeje Palace ,guests have been told to stay in their rooms and are not allowed out of the complex, with police outside the hotel. I’ve just checked into a hotel in London with no mini bar so I hope they let me out.At least if I was in Cancun I’d have optics on the wall and a fridge full of beer .Edited: 8:57 am, February 25, 2020 "
"Ok now I'm really worried! Not because of catching the virus (which has higher possibility in Canda now than Mexico, and I truly think it's just a bad flue that the media is just making us panic) but because of possible lock down of resort. I think it's super late to cancel at this point as well..Edited: 12:57 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"I wouldn't worry Tanya. Mexico will be the last place to lock down a resort. They can't afford it. It's more likely that the CDC issues travel warnings or stoppages, or that the WHO finally calls this a pandemic. But if they do, it's not what you think. When they do call it a pandemic, what will happen is actually the opposite, they move into ""control"" mode. It's the realization that they cannot stop it's spread. That's the next step, and it's likely to happen in the coming weeks and months. It appears that this virus spreads without many people showing very mild symptoms."
I am more worried about losing my money. I have paid my deposit for Cancun for June. Balance has to be paid in May (I normally take out my travel insurance when I pay the balance). Really unsure at this moment as I can't afford to lose £2800.
Use the same precautions there as you would in the US; wash hands frequently. Be smart about decisions concerning sanitation and personal hygiene. Relax and enjoy your trip!
"I personally would not cancel my trip. However, Cruise ship turned away from Ochi over coronavirus fearsjamaica-gleaner.com/article/l...ver-virus-fe…Cruise ship reportedly carrying 6,000 passengers was refused entry into port in Ocho Rios Jamaica. They proceeded on to the Caymen Islands and were reportedly refused entry this morning. Next stop is reported to be somewhere in Mexico...Stay safe everyone!"
"Shars, not sure how the UK works, but U.S. travelers generally get their money back when the government gets involved, that is, if they force the cancellation. If you cancel on your own, that's a different story. If you can still get travel insurance, I would certainly try due to what's going on."
"I purchased travel insurance yesterday for a spring trip. It was too late for cancel for any reason, but was a pretty liberal policy regardless, including cancel and other provisions related to quarantines. I would not travel without it with everything going on now."
Would you share what insurance company you used? TIA
"Hi Bridgenut,I compared plans on Insuremytrip and purchased a comprehensive Generalissimo Preferred plan for under $200. There was a great mostly medical coverage plan that would have been only $45, but you couldn’t purchase it from a few states, including my own. It’s a great site for comparing to get what works best for you."
Thank you Reviewer.
Are there any Coronavirus cases in Cancun this week 26Feb 2020
"""Are there any Coronavirus cases in Cancun this week 26Feb 2020""There are no reported cases in Mexico as of today's date."
"Austria has also quarantined a hotel, The Grand Hotel Europa, which is a 108 room Alpine tourist hub. Both cases in Austria and Spain were the result of Italians working at the resort who were infected. How many Italians visit Mexico?"
"""How many Italians visit Mexico?""Not sure but I read today that health officials had a meeting with airline reps whose airlines offered service from Italy to Cancun. Apparently they're discussing what type of screening could be implemented for those passengers. Additionally, the Hotel Association had a meeting to talk about possible measures the resorts could put into place if it's deemed necessary. They didn't elaborate on what those measures might be.As of now though neither the resorts or the airport are doing anything specific to this situation.But I think it's just a matter of time."
I have tickets booked too. I am getting really paranoid
"Going to Cancun too on March 6. A lot can change in 9 days, so for me, we'll just be monitoring and keeping an eye out for changes."
Have a trip planned to Cancun/Playa del Carmen in March and what I'm most worried about is the possibility of tourists from affected areas of China who will be at the same resorts we're staying in. Has Mexico put a flight ban from China or not? You would think they'd want to protect their multi billion dollar spring break tourist revenues to the region.
I’ve been asking myself this question to. It seems as if Mexico is just letting anyone in with no restrictions. We are going in April and I’m scared of the plane but the idea of sharing buffet lines at all inclusives and sharing beach chairs etc if hotels And airport there aren’t even concerned about keeping an eye out for possible virus carriers.
"As far as I know, there are no flights from China to Mexico City or Cancun. There are, however,. flights to Mexico City from Seoul and Tokyo. I don't think this side of Mexico is a big vacation spot for people from China."
"Yes, there are flights from mainland China to CUN and Mexico has not stopped incoming flights from China although Mexico (and Latin America in general) are not highly popular destinations with Chinese tourists. However, with the virus in EU countries now, there's just as much ""threat"" from tourists from Italy, etc.Edited: 10:44 am, February 27, 2020 "
We have a trip planned for the end of March and this is what we are worried about too! Why hasn’t Mexico restricted incoming flights from countries with reported outbreaks?
"We come to Cancun this weekend, and into next week. I still am not seeing anything definite on Cancun, Cozumel & Playa (where we may dive) being a concern...but anyone living there on here and have more insight? Thanks!"
"Contracting the virus is not even close to as concerning to me as being quarantined indefinitely in a hotel in Mexico. Or being denied reentry to the US due to an acceleration of cases. Also, the CDC could still recommend no travel outside the USA and when and if that happens, I’m def not going. I’m supposed to leave Mar 12 but have until Mar 3 to at least be refunded 85%. Seriously considering."
We have planned a vacation to Cancun for the second week of March. We are US citizens of Asian descent.Before we cancel the vacation wanted to know how we could possibly be treated in an AI family resort. Really don't want to spend the week vacation where everyone is giving us the stink eye and staying away even though there is no link to virus at all. What is it currently like at the resorts?
This suuuuucks. First trip outside the US and we gotta deal with this. Headed to cancun the 5th thru the 10th. Nonrefundable. Of all the unforseen things. Not sure what to do now. Was going to propose and everything. Just terrible.
"Just my two cents here.Wife and I just got back from 4 weeks in Cancun.Our ritual was this. And it started at the airport when left and continued till we got home. Wash hands religiously, use hand sanitizer everywhere, on the plane wipe down everything you can think of that you will touch with Lysol wipes. Get off a bus, hand gel, out of a taxi, hand gel. At the resort, every day we wiped down our chairs, lounges, table with Lysol wipes. In our room, everything got wiped down with wipes.  We go out shopping, after every store if we handled any thing hand gel. We have been doing this for years, and have Never gotten sick down there. Do we seem paranoid and overkill, maybe, but while others were getting colds, and being laid up in bed for days or worst, we partied on!  Oh yea, we also avoid buffets, to many ways for cross contamination. Avoid touching your mouth, eyes, nose before using your hand gel. Go and have fun, but take proper precautions.Like I said, just my 2 cents, but with a combined 50 years of working in hospitals, ER and ICU, we got this down, and leave again in the morning if we could."
"Tom,Honestly, I think you have reason to be concerned about racism disguised as virus worries right now. Our Asian-American friends are telling us people are moving away from them on the Metro in DC."
"Thank you, your response, well thought out and well written.Gonna bring a lot of hand sanitizer and bleach wipes."
"OMG -- that's horrible that you have to think about this, Tom. My guess is that people will hear you speaking English and just assume you're from the U.S. I do think larger groups of Asian tourists are likely to face some avoidance (hopefully nothing worse than that.....) at many tourist destinations."
We are in the process of trying to cancel our April plane tickets.
Well this all sucks. We were ready to plan our annual trip to cancun but i think we better hold off and see what happens in the future. I really hope things don't get worse but it's not looking good.
This virus is so unfortunate for everyone....Within a couple or two months ~ I am hoping that some sort of antidote comes to lite.. optimism
"Here's an excerpt from an article outlining the President's statement on the situation:Meanwhile, passengers on another vessel at the Mexican island of Cozumel faced yet another day in which they weren’t allowed to get off the ship, after they had been previously turned away from two ports.The MSC Meraviglia, turned away by two nations due to fears of the virus outbreak, docked at Cozumel on Thursday and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said passengers would be allowed to disembark.López Obrador said Mexico had to act with “humanity”after the ship was refused entry at ports in Grand Cayman and Jamaica.But Alejandra Aguirre, the health secretary of the coastal state of Quintana Roo, said two people had been detected with acute respiratory infections not believed to be the coronavirus and that other passengers wouldn’t be allowed off until tests on those two came back later Thursday.The two were identified as a 27-year-old male crew member from the Philippines and a 30-year-old female passenger from France.MSC said in a statement that the two passengers were now symptom-free and the ship would remain in Cozumel. Assuming clearance to disembark is given, passengers would be free to tour Cozumel through the end of Friday.The cruise line had expressed frustration with the rejections, which came after it reported the crew member was sick with common seasonal flu.“The ship is being allowed to dock and the passengers, those who are aboard the cruise ship, can disembark,” López Obrador said, adding that health inspections will be carried out.“We cannot act with discrimination,” he said. “Imagine if a ship arrived and it wasn’t even allowed to dock, and they were told, ‘Keep going on your way, see where you can dock.’ That is inhuman.”He added “we cannot close our ports, nor can we close our airports.”“Imagine the desperation and everything it implies, almost 5,000 people on a ship and they cannot get off,” he said. “Why such backward attitudes?”The case of the Meraviglia illustrated the crisis of nerves over the COVID-19 virus. Mexico has no confirmed cases and MSC Cruises said the crew member had only common seasonal flu, had been placed in isolation and had “nearly recovered.”Local media showed a small knot of Cozumel residents near the cruise ship dock demanding that passengers not be allowed to disembark, citing fears about potential contagion or effects on the tourism-dependent economy.Just minutes after López Obrador spoke Thursday, the governor of the Quintana Roo state, where Cozumel is located, confirmed the ship had docked, but said “no authorization has been given” yet for passengers to disembark.Gov. Carlos Joaquin wrote that health inspections would have to be carried out first."
"Zeek, I agree. I hope things get better in the coming months.Cobra, I understand. We have a trip planned to Cancun for August. That's a ways away so we are hoping for the best.Edited: 9:40 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"From a non-doctor, this is fear-mongering.The health industry seems to like these periodic ""everyone will die"" events.With just the seasonal flu, on average around 40,000 people in the USA die every year. Scale that to China and it would be roughly 170,000 people. Maybe you double it because their health system probably sucks.Then think about the fear and anguish over the swine flu. The US CDC recommended that people not go to Mexico...but I did. I lost faith in the CDC then.What happened to the Zika virus? During the last summer Olympics every baby would be a pin head baby because of Zika. Now you never hear of it.Personally I would not change travel plans. Wear a mask on the plane if they are effective. Sanitize your hands before touching your face...every single time.I see no reason to not go at this time.Edited: 10:29 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"”The health industry seems to like these periodic ""everyone will die"" events.”Smh. The CDC and WHO are hardly “the health industry” and they use the best science they have with rapidly changing and evolving information, to protect us. The danger comes from those who sow the seeds of mistrust in science and operate in wishes that serve their interests (vacation, financial, political) instead of facts. That someone didn’t get swine flu last time so shouldn’t worry this time is a logical fallacy and also ignores prior global concerns they did contain and save millions from, Ebola for example.Surely there are kinder words to describe microcephaly than “pinhead baby” too since families do actually face this tragedy, from Zika or otherwise.Edited: 5:49 am, February 28, 2020 "
The person who posted #86 should be awarded a medal. Nicely worded
"Today México has one case confirmed! :( I have a travel to Cancún on march 9th, I am cancelling my resort reservation, vacations should be fun! And so much news is giving me anxiety.. i Will keep My flghts because airlines Will not refund me, and I Will think if maybe we can Rent a prívate Airbnb.. i don't know if that it's safer????"
"anya, i am travelling with my wife to a resort in Cancun on 6th march for a week and its all paid for. looking at a lof the reports there no one reported in mexico with having it but that does not mean its not out there, but i still feel its ok to go there, in fact i feel safer going there than Italy or Spain right now"
"""Today México has one case confirmed!""Where did you get this info? And where in Mexico?"
"According to NBC news, two cases have been confirmed in Mexico as of this morning (Mexico City). As Mexico has had little travel restrictions, I am afraid that the actual number could be much higher. In addition to the risk of exposure, we are very apprehensive of being quarantined and/or not being allowed to return to the US...."
"HGNOLA and Chefathome, thanks for the info."
2 were reported today in mexico but not cancun.
"We are in the same situation with a college young adult scheduled to travel to Cancun 3/8 for the week (all inclusive - CLT to Cancun travel). I see the first cases of coronavirus in Mexico. I'm less concerned that he will get CV, more that he will be quarantined and stuck someplace. (I'm immuno-comporised myself but am NOT a nervous traveler/parent.). Appreciate any thoughts or advice, thank you!Edited: 12:29 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"We are scheduled for the early part of May. Lots can change between now and then, so I am certainly keeping an eye on things. Luckily I did purchase cancel for any reason insurance, although cancelling is the last thing I want to do. Cancun is my happy place - sitting by that beautiful ocean brings me such peace. We have always been ""germaphobe"" travelers - we practice good handwashing, use of hand sanitizer and always wipe down the areas on the plane with Lysol wipes. I am not concerned about getting the virus as we are both perfectly healthy individuals. I am, however, concerned about what might happen once there regarding a quarantine or possible difficulties arriving back in the states. Time will tell."
"We have just today had one confirmed case in Mexico City that was contracted in Italy at a conference. There was an infected person at the conference who lives in Malaysia. The case is mild and the family has been quarantined and under close supervision. Doesn't pose a threat in Cancun at this point. If a case of it is found in the Riviera Maya area though, the airport will shut down. No one in, No one out. My orthopedist at Hospiten, a well known hospital here has confirmed this. The government has alerted all hospitals of the procedure just in case."
Mexico City. It's confirmed
"10. I read the Bloomberg article. My BIG concern is going through the Cancun Airport (with travelers coming in from Europe where there is a large outbreak in countries like Italy and Germany) and all international airports are incubators for colds, flus and goodness knows what else. I’m not concerned about the VIRM stay, it’s getting in/out of the airport that concerns me."
"ELLY: “No one in or out”. Really. Boy, good thing I bought Sunwing’s Travel Insurance for $130.00 as it covers travelers who have to fly home for medical reasons or sickness. Or if airport is closed, they pay all additional hotel costs, meals etc. if you are forced to stay."
JoanS: Great reporting. I’m just today learning that they DID NOT allow the cruise ship passengers to disembark the ship - good decision. What would stop some passengers from taking the ferry over to Playa del Carmen and spending time on 5th Avenue etc. That’s how these outbreaks spread.
How much was your insurance if you don’t mind me asking? What does it cover
"Elly,Thank you so much for the info on airport. Wow. I dream of being a possible expat in the state of the Yucatan one day but not this way. Do you think if the airport in Cancun closed the authorities would also close the Merida and Campeche airports?"
86. I agree with you totally. I will trust the CDC and WHO any day over the “science deniers” like Donald Trump and Mike Pence. Pence believes “prayer” is the answer and now Trump has put HIM in charge of this virus outbreak and scientists are being “muzzled” and not allowed to report the true facts. That should worry every American - thank goodness I live in Canada.
The airport will close???? I doubt it. I went in and out during the swine flu scare. We were practically the only ones there and we stayed perfectly healthy.
"That mention of the airport closing is VERY concerning. I'm not worried my traveling kid will die from CV, but do not want him trapped/quarantined."
"FishBoy1: Just read your great post. Thank you for some sensible pointers. If I decide to go (need the R&R) will follow your advice. My daughter who lives in Dubai has cancelled her March break plans and thinks as a senior with some medical issues, I should stay home. My son agrees. But I think as long as I stay at the resort, I will be okay. And the VIRM is a great resort with very high hygiene standards,"
"We are traveling to Cancun today. So far Mexico is safe. At the same time, coronavirus is just another virus. Of course, it is more complicated for people with pre-existing medical conditions or for elderly people."
"Lyubov 1: Please keep us posted on how your trip went (under great pressure from adult kids to cancel) but I so badly need to get out of the Great Canadian White North and this “freeze we are in) but I am worried about getting in/out of the Cancun Airport with their International flights from Europe and Asia. Please enjoy your holiday, be safe, and Wash Your Hands always."
"Checosa210: I am traveling from Canada and my insurance cost me $130 for 2 weeks vacation and it covers up to $5 million in expenses and hospital costs, hotels and meals etc. Seems like a lot of money, but I would never travel without health insurance as you never know what can happen. Better to be penny wise than penny foolish. Especially if you are a senior."
"VictoriaK: As a parent with now adult kids of my own, and knowing kids LOVE Cancun, I would make sure they have insurance (kids in Cancun get wild) so I would buy the travel insurance just to be content that if anything happens they are covered."
"Isn't it ""penny wise and pound foolish?"" :)"
We are in the same boat and my work and my daughter's school just put restrictions on international travel. If Mexico is listed as having a high incidence upon our return I would need to stay out of work for 14 days and my daughter will need to stay out of school for 14 days. I need to make my decision by Monday. We are all very sad and disappointed. Any advice is welcome.
¸I guess you are wrong now.
"""Any advice is welcome.""It is your decision. Personally this coronavirus issue has reached hysteria levels. News and medical folks need to place it in context by also showing side by side the cases of flu and deaths from flu in an average year. Do it by country and in the northern hemisphere.I doubt that this event is even on the order of a normal much less bad flu year.I traveled to Cozumel via the Cancun airport near the height of the swine flu event because I saw it as another over hyped fearmongering event.Edited: 8:25 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"Arlene, I agree. When traveling internationally, I always have cancel for any reason travel insurance and travel health insurance. I just feel better having this when I travel. My friends think I am crazy because I always have this. They ask me why I am spending extra money. Its a peace of mind for me."
"headed to cancun for spring break in aprii starting to thinking aboutcancelling but should we ? what are their plans in Mexico if you get sick? they charge 5,000 to look at you there in a hospital. opinions?"
Lulabae - my husband's work just issued same request and i suspect mine will follow.... I cannot miss 2 wks of work without causing serious disruption. I'll hold off til the last possible moment to cancel but it's a huge gamble to leave the country if we possibly can't return to work & school for 2 wks. Very disappointed and i feel so badly for all the workers in MX who will be hit hard by cancellations.
Savvy- please elaborate on your warnings. This sucks ~~

"What is the real risk of being trapped in Cancun or impacted by a quarantine upon return to the USA?Look at Italy. There has been a spike of coronavirus for days or weeks (exact period not known to me). The US State Department is suggesting no travel to Italy because of the virus.Are there quarantine measures for flights to/from Italy? If not then even about 900 cases and 21 deaths in Italy...no problem yet.Currently there may be TWO cases in Mexico. None near Cancun. So if there are no issues with travel to Italy, Mexico is even further from that impact.Hysteria driven by the medical industrial complex and ""news"" sources is not a way to live your life.Look at it logically...not by emotions, fears and watching fear mongering news reports."

Has it been confirmed they will close the airport down if it gets to riviera maya?
"Zeeka - US workplaces and schools are begining to issue self-quarantine protocols if workers and students visit any country listed high risk (the list will grow, and MX isn't on it today but that may change in 2-3 wks). We can leave for vacation and by the time we return, if enough cases are documented in MX, we won't be able to return to work or school for 14 days. That scenario relies on self- reporting but I'm not going to lie and risk spreading a pandemic to my co-workers and community because i wanted to go on vaca and didnt want to be inconvenienced by self-quarantine. So the gamble is even if MX isn't on the list when you leave for vaca, what happens during the week you are there? I really wish my March trip was domestic.... I have another trip booked in MX for Dec and will hope this has subsided by then."
"”Hysteria driven by the medical industrial complex and ""news"" sources is not a way to live your life.Look at it logically...not by emotions, fears and watching fear mongering news reports.”Laughing out loud. It’s hard to take seriously suggestions to look at things “logically” when they are laced with conspiracy theories. I’m sure Breitbart and Limbaugh have some excellent scientists advising their minimization of the crisis. I’ll stick with the CDC, WHO, and mainstream news sources, thanks."
"Reviewer, show the facts that this event is far worse than a typical flu season.I don't accept the hysteria as a way to make decisions.As for the person who is concerned about a two week home quarantine, cancel your trip if you want to go by the worst case scenario. Where is this ""high risk"" list?"
My cancellation strategy is to wait just in case the airline itself cancels their flights into CUN since my tix have a big change fee.
"Timetotttravel11: I find it shocking when I travel and talk with other travellers how many people do NOT buy travel insurance.. About 10 years ago, the parents of my son's best friend left Toronto for England to visit relatives, the father had a heart attack. They ended up taking out a mortgage to pay the bills from his hospital stay in England. He was only 55 years old. People who travel without insurance are ""penny wise, pound foolish"" as the Brits say. BUY insurance everyone - young or old. A stay in a Mexico hospital could cost your a fortune. Be safe, be wise."
https:/…Third possible case in Cancun. Does anyone know for sure when they will shut down the airports as previously reported?
"""My cancellation strategy is to wait just in case the airline itself cancels their flights into CUN since my tix have a big change fee.""That is one way to deal with the issue. Note that with hurricanes, they don't allow free changes until a few days before predicted passage/landfall.What parameter will you use to decide if airlines are likely to do this? Are they doing it for Italy? China? Any other country with a lot (undefined value) of cases?"
Will they shut the airport down? This is too risky
"Amyt - the woman from el centro (calif) is being observed in Mexicali which is Baja Calif (the W coast of Mexico). I read that story yesterday but thought the detail of her flying through Cancun might be an error? But regardless, it seems that it's a matter of timr before the numbers jump. So far, all cases in MX seem to be tied to visits to Europe."
"“Reviewer, show the facts that this event is far worse than a typical flu season.I don't accept the hysteria as a way to make decisions.As for the person who is concerned about a two week home quarantine, cancel your trip if you want to go by the worst case scenario.Where is this ""high risk"" list?”The facts of coronavirus are that, while at this moment there are more cases of flu, the coronavirus is: more virulent, more deadly, has no vaccine or no antivirals to prevent or mitigate it, spreading rapidly, has higher potential for spread because people are contagious before symptoms manifest. Trusting factual sources such as the CDC website is hardly fear mongering or panicking. The same suspect “news” sources that are downplaying this virus are thrilled to deal in spreading panic when it comes to issues such as immigration. The “high risk list” is on the CDC website. It has charts listing countries and regions by rating of concern level, updated regularly. It posts new incidences daily to show its spread. “As for the person who is concerned about a two week home quarantine, cancel your trip if you want to go by the worst case scenario.“ It’s not a worst case scenario if you have one of the numerous school systems or work places that are implementing policies related to travel abroad. Are you suggesting people violate those policies and don’t self-quarantine? As far as not accepting “hysteria” to make decisions, you lose credibility on the hysteria front when you throw around phrases like “medical industrial complex”. For the record, we have not cancelled our Mexico trip yet. We are in watchful waiting and fact-gathering mode."
"per media reports from reliable sources three cases confirmed in Mexico...all had traveled from the impacted areas in Italy. Talk of closing airport? Where did that come from? If this continues closing borders might be necessary but at this point have not heard that at all. I think the biggest risk for ANY virus is the AI resorts with people coughing, sneezing and worse all over and oh those buffets...yuck...that would be the challenge for most."
“ I flew from Mexico City to NYC today. Two of the biggest population centers in the world. Two of the most concurred airports globally. Not a single measure against Coronavirus in both of them. It’s going to hit us hard“ I just read this.. THIS IS NOT GOOD
@139 agreed...that is where the three cases came through I believe from Northern Italy....countries are not taking this seriously...same here in USA...not one step being taken last week in ATL international arrivals.
"ReviewerMaryland1: I agree with your post especially when you say “The same suspect “news” sources that are downplaying this virus are thrilled to deal in spreading panic when it comes to issues such as immigration”.I also agree when you note “You lose credibility on the hysteria front when you throw around phrases like ‘medical industrial complex’ “. You are right on. I too am taking a wait and see as my travel date is March 30th. Till then I’ll continue to follow advice given by CDC and WHO. Safe travels everyone AND buy travel insurance.Edited: 10:45 am, February 29, 2020 "
"@141 travel insurance is good but it is not covering this epidemic unless you have the much more expensive ""cancel for any reason"" option and even then not a full 199% coverage."
"""https:/…Third possible case in Cancun. Does anyone know for sure when they will shut down the airports as previously reported?""If you read the article it reads as if the mention of Cancun might be a mistake. It wouldn't make sense for her to have flown through Cancun to get to where she is now. Obviously that's just my opinion. To best of my knowledge it hasn't been reported anywhere that they will shut down our airport if there's a confirmed case here. Someone mentioned in here that they heard it from a doctor who heard it at the hospital who supposedly heard it from the government. That's not even close to accurate reliable in my book. That's hearsay. After the two confirmed cases here in Mexico the president actually said that the airports wouldn't be shut down. That has been reported by various news outlets here one of which I posted a few days earlier in case anyone was interested. If having a reported case was the criteria for shutting down the airports then Mexico City's airport would already be closed along with one other. Through the whole Zeka virus situation they didn't shut out airport down. It might have been a ghost town at times but it always remained open. I totally get that people have some tough decisions to make. Schools and work places in the US placing restrictions on when you can return to school or work if you travel to a high risk area may make the decision for some people. And, at least to me, that's totally understandable. But I think it's important to maintain a steady medium and not totally discount people's fears and concerns or the warnings put out out by the different government agencies (to me those people who do that lose all credibility) while at the same time not feeding the hysteria by posting unverified information as fact. In this situation (as in life) it's my opinion that an open mind and reasonable caution is warranted. And nobody should be mocked or made to feel stupid once they've made the decision whether or not to travel. That's a personal decision that nobody has the right to criticize. IJust my two pesos worth......."
"Thanks, Arlene.“ But I think it's important to maintain a steady medium and not totally discount people's fears and concerns or the warnings put out out by the different government agencies (to me those people who do that lose all credibility) while at the same time not feeding the hysteria by posting unverified information as fact.“Joan, perfect!"
In Cancun today and nobody is worried down here. I would have trip insurance! Wouldn’t want to get quarantined down here but I wouldn’t cancel unless a travel ban!
"My heart breaks as I cancel my Cancun trip for May. We booked an all inclusive resort and I don't want to risk the chances that we might get quarantined. I'm not worried about the virus, but mostly of the ""human-panickings"" and the inconveniences. I would still stay away from the buffets though."
"gene: I am from Canada and I did buy my travel insurance through Sunwing Vacations who are based in Toronto. It costs $130 per person (for 10-14 day vacations) and you can ‘cancel’ up to 3 hours before your travel time. It pays up to $5 million in coverage and includes baggage loss, trip interruption and other losses. It is through Manulife Insurance (which just happens to also be my husband’s employer insurance company for our health and dental benefits. Sunwing’s rate was a little cheaper than dealing directly with Manulife but if I fly internationally I buy direct from them. I read the policy carefully which everyone should do to see if there are any pre-existing clauses included. Better be safe than sorry."
"Thank you for your sensible and informative posts, reviewermaryland. Your point that some news stations have no problem when spreading hysteria around immigration is well taken!"
@147 I was addressing the situation of the traveler you gave the advice to whom you gave the advice ...I believe they are in US and my insurance knowledge is limited to policies that you can buy here in US.There are many finding out the hard way that this epidemic is not covered. That said with government warnings most airlines are helpful...don't think any such warning exists for Mexico but everything could change any minute.
"Can’t believe people have managed to work immigration rights into what should be an informative thread that informs perspective travelers but leave it to this crew to work politics into it. Bottom line news outlets On both sides are often dramatic and biased (attracts readers and that makes them money). Because of this make sure to read from a variety of sources while sticking to advisement from official health organizations and draw your own conclusions. Probably the worst thing you can do to stay informed is read these thread on TA.Edited: 12:04 pm, February 29, 2020 "

Yea and you dont need to continue it. Just stop everyone.
Read the fine print...my travel insurance policy does not cover epidemics or pandemics.
"Tamzen,Does it cover quarantines? Mine does."
"Thinking of canceling our trip to Cancun of Apr 3-9th. Not confident that Mexican resorts would provide accurate info about Corona cases, buffets aren't a good idea, possibility of getting stuck or quarantined in a foreign country doesn't sound at all fun. Very bummed though! I can cancel trip package through Costco but will pay airline fees as my travel insurance does not cover epidemics or pandemics."
@154 what insurance is that? A quarantine would usually be result of a medical event like pandemic . Just wondering.
Policy is with Allianz Travel an affiliate of Alaska Airlines.
"ReviewerMaryland1: I enjoyed reading some of your reviews. I especially loved the one you wrote on the Iberostar Grand Paraiso “shame about the food” as I agree with you totally but I’m not as honest as you. I too stayed at the Grand in 2018 in a superior ocean front in building 70. I was very unhappy with the food there. Also the resort was only at 40% occupancy although they would not admit it. I had stayed at the Rose Hall Iberosztar Grand in Jamaica and the food was wonderful. Everything at Grand Paraiso was warm or cold, no consistency and their pizza Was like rubber and fries We’re always soggy as you said. And it felt like the “place that fun forgot” most days. Met a couple from Montreal who’d stayed at the Valentin Imperial Maya the year before and said it had foam parties, mechanical bull riding and fun all days long. On the way back to the airport we picked up several couples at the VIRM and they just loved the place - very high rate of return guests. So that’s where I’m heading on March 30th for 2 weeks. Great beach they say. I also stayed at the Hideaway at the Royalton in 2015. Loved it but the beach in Puerto Morales is terrible with sargassum. Anyway, I would never return to the Grand Paraiso because of the food and it’s just too BORING!!! ha! ha!Edited: 12:57 pm, February 29, 2020 "
Allianz coverage does indicate that expenses due to quarantine MAY be covered depending on your policy and they note that you need to check for exclusions. If it is covered in the standard coverage that is good and probably going to be a selling feature in the future. I think with the Diamond Princess cruise passengers that was such an extraordinary situation that their expenses are covered by Princess...but not sure on that. Many have lost a month of work.
"ReviewerMaryland1: I just got off the phone with Sunwing Vacations in Toronto and I was told not only can I cancel for any reason whatsoever up to 3 hours before departure, but it covers up to $5 million for medical. And includes overstays in the case of pandemic outbreak or if you are put under quarantine for up to one month. And trip interruption includes having to fly home early for family sickness reasons. So, I feel good about the coverage I have and so I’ve told my adult kids to “bud out” - Mama is going to ride a mechanical bull - well maybe not at my age, but I’ve bought the “Privilege Package” and I’m going to stuff myself with lobster tails for two weeks. I have been dieting since July for this trip and I’ll probably gain back the 20 lbs. I’ve lost. But hey, life is an adventure isn’t it!Edited: 1:13 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"I just returned from Cancun on Weds, 2/27. There were warnings posted about travel advisories regarding travelers from China, but otherwise it was business as usual.The only thing that concerns me is I traveled during what seemed to be Canadian, French, and lots of other European countries' ""spring break""."
Just cancelled mine for Rivera Maya in March. Sad but I think its a right thing to do. Its almost impossible to prevent spread in All Inclusive's and it is just a matter of time. Don't want to be stuck in the Quarantine
"ACDC: I have been advised that there are things you can do at AI resorts. For one thing, at the resort I am going to the Valentin Imperial Riviera Maya, where breakfast and lunch are buffets (but no dinners) my daughter suggested “order breakfast from room service early like 6:30 am” ( the breakfast buffet doesn’t open till 7:00 am) so you will not have to worry about others touching the food. Also at lunch, only order food cooked to order (like pasta, fish, chicken etc) thereby avoiding people touching. I am staying at an ‘adult only’ resort and that is why I will not go to family resorts because parents don’t monitor their kids at the buffets and they touch things and then walk away - a great way to get sick. All dinners are at restaurants and so I’m not worried about that. But if I were booked at a family AI I would definitely cancel my booking. Also, it helps if you are staying at a higher-end resort (at least a 4 or 5) as those resorts have higher standards of hygiene and cleanliness - you get what you pay for as they say."
"Arlene, thanks again for your thoughts! Great idea to call our trip insurance proactively too."
Hospital treatment in England is free? Why would someone of needed to mortgage their house? It's not like the US over here healthcare wise.
"ReviewerMaryland1: “Right back at You” ( as Ellen would say), after reading your excellent reviews and commentary, I feel we are sewn from the same cloth. After I leave a resort, I feel bad if I have to write negative comments (especially if I have enjoyed the staff and services in general. But going forward, I think I’ll be more honest about things in general. I feel we are becoming a mutual admiration society and I enjoy your honesty and the informative commentary you make. Safe travels always."
"Tina H: This was a Canadian citizen traveling to visit family in England. He was not a “Resident” of Britain and as such the NRS would not cover this hospital stay. It only covers Residents of Britain not visitors. It did not matter that he had dual citizenship Canadian/British and those are the facts. And his wife was a nurse. So she should have known better. It put a strain on the marriage, she had to go back to nursing and became ill through a patient and passed away “too early”If you want to travel anywhere, no matter your age always buy out of country medical and travel insurance. A word to the wise is sufficient !!"

Get to your room, clean doorknobs, light switches, and TV remote with them. I'm a 73 year old with some lung trouble, I didn't get sick.

"There have been many doctors indicating that this is blown way out of proportion. The fake news channels CNN and MSNBC will have you believe this is the end of the world!

"@funinthesun, I never want to get political on this website but you made a good point which news channels your watching as the the slant of the virus scenarios. That’s why I watch ALL news stations and websites to get information not strictly a left leaning or right leaning station. At this point I only want to hear about prevention, the airlines plans, hotel plans in and out of Mexico. I only want health information not stock market or permanent recession speculation. We must think positive. The Mexican people can really be impacted worse than our short term impact. They literally rely on our money for their families to eat. That’s why wild speculation hurts more than just us canceling a vacation because we are reacting to a political message on either side of the spectrum."
"Irony is when people like #176 and #179 talking about fake news, fear, blown out proportion virus, politics conspiracy theories etc.. just like their emperor.. and that same person likes vacationing in MEXICO.. :-) Lol Back to issue  Everybody have opinions about this flu, and everyone should act and do best for themselves, biggest problem is travel in and out , me personally i would think twice.."
"#70, actually Mexico has become very popular with Chinese tourists, so much so that a lot of resorts now hire consultants to help them cater to the Chinese. There are three direct flights from China to MX. i’m just clearing that up, obviously the virus has now spread to Europe and beyond"

For comparison, over 10 million US tourists go to Mexico every year."

"I am a 65 year old married female....going solo to PDC several times a year always staying at the IB resorts and call them my second home. I am due to fly out Wednesday for another 1 week trip to IB Tucan. But have huge concerns with this Coronavirus traveling solo with so many unknowns. I have booked the trip through Apple with the trIp insurance so I am fully covered for a trip cancellation and voucher up until 3 hours before the trip. Here are my concerns regarding the trip if I do go I would like to share. What should happen if I do get sick down there? Will I be taken to a hospital, tested for Coronavirus which the tests are very expensive if hospitals or clinics even have any available? Am I responsible for the cost of that test? What happens then? Would I be sent off the resort property to recover, then go into quarantine, and who and how much would all that cost? Another scenario, I don’t get sick but the resort has an outbreak, would we be sent off the property to a quarantine placement facility with a bunch of cots? When and how do we get back to the States and who pays for that? The Apple insurance plan has a number to the travel insurance company to go over the plan but they are not open on Sundays. I am not on Medicare, have excellent private medical insurance through my husband, but does not cover overseas travel. The Apple Travel insurance plan is something, but from what I can read from the fine print, only will cover $500 maximum for expenses related to quarantine. So for all of those like me, it might be great to say you will go and take your chances like I sure want to do, but looking at it realistically there are many potential problems that are out of your control and could cost you a lot of money. Something to think about."

I have been reading some of your posts, i.e., you did a great review for Sonny’s Pizza, I also see one for another pizza restaurant on Isla Mujeres. As a Destination Expert, living in Cancun are you permitted to “commercialze “ certain places you and your boyfriend frequent and then recommend that establishment? I have a legal background, and I’m just curious - when is a conflict a conflict? ""Are you freaking serious???And I am a lawyer so I know what a conflict it. And where have I or anyone else said that I've received gifts, services, money or other benefits for my my reviews or recommendations? I'll tell you where: NOWHERE because I haven't.I am free (just as everyone else is) to write reviews on the places we've been and the places we like. I am not forcing anyone to go there and gain nothing financially from recommending them. If someone asks for recommendations then I'm going to give them. It's my opinion and just because I'm a DE doesn't mean I'm prohibited from having and sharing my opinion. In fact, what good would a DE be If they didn't have first hand knowledge of places and topics people ask about.If you don't trust my opinion or don't like my advice then that's fine. That is entirely your perrogative. But I'm not going to stop sharing just because it rubs you the wrong way."
"CY9395,Thank you."
"bcbdent, I'm sorry but I can't answer most of your questions but I can tell you that if for any reason you must go to a doctor or hospital here, most require payment in a certain amount up front before they will treat. This is the case many times even if you have insurance that would cover it. They want their money immediately and it's up to you to apply for reimbursement. If you must have a test performed the same thing applies. You are responsible for the cost. tellI have used Apple Trip Insurance one time. We we stuck here during hurricane Wilma and for 10 days after. We had to find out own way home and Apple reimbursed us each for $500. It cost each of us about $1000 in airfare and one nights hotel stay in Dallas as the only flights we could get were to Dallas. Then we had to the flights back to New York. I wish I had more answers for you. Sorry."
Anyone who truly has a legal background would know how to spell idyllic
"Arlene - Joan S was JUST made a TA Expert. (in the last few weeks)But many of the TA Experts and long term posters all recommended Joan due to her great and helpful advice over the last few yearsJoan , thank you for your patience in these threads that often go sideways"
"Arlene,Yes you need to stop. Joan has done an absolute fantastic job as a contributor to this forum for quite some time, long before she became a DE. I am not a lawyer but common sense tells me that as a member of Trip Advisor she has the right to review the places she visits. She has every right to share her opinion on this thread just as you have now done at least 20 times in the last 24 hours. You will get little to no support from other members in your choice to be unkind to Joan."
"Arlene, even with all her reading from all of her trusted news sources, claimed there were two cases in Playa earlier this week and caused undo concern on the forum."
The R0 value (transmission rate) is estimated to be between 4.7 and 6.6 according to a study (still undergoing peer review Because this is so new) so this is higher than the Ro given by the Chinese government.
"Oh man. My husband, two young sons, and I have been so excited about our trip to xcaret, south of playa. I bought the trip through a 3rd party app and it’s non refundable. We leave March 7. I plan to call tomorrow to see if there are any options about moving dates. I’m not as concerned about catching the virus, but more concerned about quarantine, being stuck in Mexico, and mostly medical costs if have you get medical treatment there. I have no travel insurance. We are still leaning towards going as it was expensive, and we are so excited. Yet, I’m nervous. I’m hoping it’s not too late to buy travel insurance if we do decide to go. Any more advice re travel insurance?"
"Well, honestly, this thread went sideways. I certainly appreciate Joan's advice. I love knowing where she goes and what she does. The tips really help everyone. None of us are paid for anything so there is no conflict in our comments/advice.Now on to Cononavirus....according to infectuous disease experts it has been spreading since last November. We're just now seeing wider spread and it's becoming publicly aware. Travel (other than to northern Italy or China/Japan) should be with precautions. Take wipes to wipe down the tables, wash your hands often, stay away from people who are honking or sneezing....pretty much like any flu season."
"People why don’t you just put report Arlene’s post and somebody ar TripAdvisor will take them all off. That’s all it takes but I’m on my phone and it’s impossible to Do on your phoneAs for the poster who said they didn’t buy travel insurance, would you consider buying it now. I would get on the phone right now with my personal insurance and find out what they’re going to cover and how it’s going to work. This virus is not your risk. you’re taking kids to a park. When one of them cut falls and cuts their arm and needs stitches wouldn’t it be nice to know how this is all going to get paid. If it turns out your commercial insurance is not going to pay then you need to look into travel insurance. Also be aware of that for most US insurance companies you will have to pay the bill and then the insurance will reimburse you. If you can’t do that you want to find a travel insurance provider that will pay the providers in Mexico directly."
"Yes, thank-you! Going to call and get medical coverage travel insurance today. I’m pretty sure we can’t move our trip, and will lose our money, so gonna have to hope for the best. Well, at least this opened my eyes to the need for insurance. I’ve traveled tons in the past, but never bought insurance. After reading this, I realize how risky that was!"
"""Also be aware of that for most US insurance companies you will have to pay the bill and then the insurance will reimburse you. If you can’t do that you want to find a travel insurance provider that will pay the providers in Mexico directly.""Even still you can run into a situation here where you will be out of pocket for medical expenses. Hospitals and clinics want payment (they estimate what they think treatment will cost) up front before they will even begin to treat the person. Many times the person seeking treatment ends up paying this because even travel insurance companies that pay directly to the facility don't pre-pay.Edited: 9:50 am, March 02, 2020 "
"JoanS: A couple of things should be said. One, I never suggested there is some kind of a quid pro quo going on or that you were obtaining some kind of benefit from the restaurants you seemed to be promoting. I also understand that you just recently became a DE and the restaurant reviews you did may have been done before you you were chosen as one. I believe even the appearance of a conflict of interest should be avoided if you are acting as a DE for Cancun. Destination experts must adhere to the same Trip Advisor Forum Guidelines that apply to all members. Therefore, I will take up this discussion through the proper TA channels. Have a nice day."
Wouldn’t be much of a DE if you can’t recommend anywhere.
"I am a casual commenter who really has no right to post this, but I will anyways. Is there any chance TripAdvisor can just close this thread, as well as the other Coronavirus thread? I feel like the topic has been discussed to the point of exhaustion. It is now just off topic comments, politics, bashing, or the same points being rehashed endlessly. Anyone else agree it's time to end this?"
^^ hahha ^^ that’s funny. Of course it can be closed by TA and you can ask. JMO - highly doubt it would do any good to try to close this topic ~ a lot of people are concerned on these happenings.
"Zeeka, fair enough. Just thought I would throw that out there. Just seems the conversation has strayed a long ways from travel advice. Is this the place to talk covid-19 stats, facts, infection rates, etc? In my eyes no, but hey, perhaps it is."
In today's Riviera Maya News:https:/…2020.html
"I’m leaving on Wednesday, March 4. I have no intention of staying home but just because the Mexican authorities aren’t wearing facemasks I’m not feeling completely secure. We’re talking a tourist destination in Mexico. It’s not beyond the scope that the Mexican authorities may choose to bury their heads in the sand. They’ve done it before in regards to violence, alcohol problems, and other potentially damaging problems with tourism."
"""...but more concerned about quarantine, being stuck in Mexico, ...""Nicole T, this issue is being sensationalist by the fear-mongering press, politicized and just out of proportion fear-mongering leading to hysteria.I don't have details on China but air travel there should be suspended.Look at Italy. Are flights canceled to and from that country? Are people on flights from Italy being checked? That is not a quarantine.Note that the cases in Italy have been building for a few weeks (unknown timeline to me). If flights are still going to/from Italy, why would flights be suspended to Mexico where there may only be four known cases? The Cancun area may have zero cases so it is in better shape.There are roughly 60 cases in the USA. Have all flights between states and internationally from the US been halted?Look at it objectively. I see no reason for a near term issue with Mexico in general and less so for Cancun.You can cancel your trip. Safety is important. Hysteria or fear driven decisions may not be the best way to go.I would go now with ZERO concerns. Other than normal concerns about germs which are everywhere. I just killed several thousand before eating lunch using wetwipes."

"Thomas T: I certainly HOPE thatas you state: “Mexican authorizes may choose to bury their heads in the sand”. I have more faith in the Mexican Authorities than you. After all, tourism is their bread and butter and they will do what is needed to “keep the tourists coming”. Also the CDC and WHO said is is not necessary to wear “masks”. They should only be worn they say by someone who has flu symptoms to protect others from “their germs” so I’m not concerned that Cancun Airport staff are not wearing them."
"Nichols T: It is not too late to buy insurance. Call an out of country travel insurance carrier. You still have time before March 7. Go and enjoy your holiday, just take caution with buffets and you should be fine - that is what my travel agency is saying. Life is too short to stay home out of fears that may never materialize. “0nly thing we have to fear is fear itself” - Franklin D. Roosevelt."
"Oops, I made a boo boo:"".... is being sensationalist....""should have read:""... is being sensationalized...'My apologies for that incorrect wording."
"Another vote to not close this thread. Lots of good information buried within the other stuff. For example, I once again learned something from one of Joan's posts that everyone should pay particular attention to. ""Also be aware of that for most US insurance companies you will have to pay the bill and then the insurance will reimburse you. If you can’t do that you want to find a travel insurance provider that will pay the providers in Mexico directly."" I always pay attention when Joan writes something. Lots of gold nuggets buried in her posts, but you don't have to look hard to find them!"
"Blue Cross Blue Shield has international travel insurance that seems very affordable (GeoBlue). I'm not sure if you need to be a qualifying participant in their domestic plan to qualify but here is their link: https://www.geobluetravelinsurance.com/. 2 adults, 5 days in Mexico - with a $1MM in coverage with no deductible for <$60 US. Lower priced options for deductible plans are also available. Of course, it is only medical and wouldn't cover travel bans or delays in returning home to the US. Just a option for some who might like the added piece of mind."
"Leidback, thanks for the compliment. Really, I appreciate your kind words. But I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that the beginning of the post you referenced was me quoting part of a post by Carol A.I went on to say that as most hospitals, doctors and clinics here require payment before they will treat you, it's likely that even with a policy that says they will pay the health provider directly you could be out of pocket for the costs.While you might find a company that will pay directly I think you'll have great difficulty in finding on that will pre-pay before treatment has even been rendered.Bottom line is there are different rules on payments for tourists than for locals.So Carol A should get credit for the first part of my post. Credit where credit due and all."
"We got travel/medical insurance. That was easy. Now the hard part is finding hand sanitizer and wipes for travel. Everyone is panicking, and now those that could really use these things, can’t get them. My local Walgreens, Kroger, and Home Depot are sold out of hand sanitizer. I live in a large suburb outside of Houston. On amazon, Wet ones, purell, and Lysol Hand wipes are often sold out or can’t be delivered in time. We’ve got a small amount of sanitizer at home and I was able to get some Lysol wet wipes for household cleaning that I will use to wipe down the seats. Pandemonium ensues."
"Nicole T, we're finding that here in Cancun too. Many farmacias are out of those items and really aren't sure when they'll have more in stock. They're also very difficult to find in the grocery stores. Leidback, Visa and MasterCard are accepted everywhere that takes plastic. Discover and Amex in some places but not all.Honestly, I'm not sure about health care facilities as I have health insurance from a local company that I use when necessary. But, if it were me, I'd stick with Visa or MasterCard. A credit card is only useful if it's accepted where you need to use it."
"Regarding quarantine, I can understand the concern. I don’t know where you live, but where I am people are being asked to self-quarantine if they traveled and someone was sick or if they think there’s a possibility there was exposure. So even if the government doesn’t force this, like co-pilot said, you could still have to self-quarantine. I know one traveler who already had to do this and there are several firemen in my area in quarantine. Of course you could always refuse, but you’d probably be publicly named if you then spread the virus."
I just received an email from work saying anyone traveling to leave 2 or 3 countries can’t return to work for two weeks or work from home if it’s an option hopefully Mexico isn’t next on that list
"@Nichole T. Same here, some stores are wiped out of hand sanitizer and wipes. Some are even running low on bleach."
Checos - would you fly via Seattle now??Mexico looks safer than the USA
"checosa...where is this ""list?""I can assume that China, Italy, Iran are on it. Not sure what other countries have a lot of cases. Be right back.Based on the following map I would assume also South Koreahttps://www.khou.com/article/news/health/cor…Edited: 12:03 am, March 03, 2020 "
"If you look at the numbers, Mexico is at five cases. There are about 37 other countries with more cases.Maybe others have insight into mandatory quarantine if they travel some place but Mexico seems to be at low risk of that happening soon."
"Booze is cheap in Mexico. If your having problems finding hand sanitised hand gel and given that the best one has to alcohol based why not buy a bottle of cheep alcohol and take a small plastic refill with you?Just a thought...Edited: 3:46 am, March 03, 2020 "
Co-pilot- it’s on the CDCs website. Also many newspapers have a map showing the levels the CDC has places some countries on
Just wanted to post for anyone having trouble finding hand sanitizer of Clorox wipes we are all sold out in my area as well at the larger stores but found ton at the dollar stores. If you have a dollar store maybe check there. We leave Saturday and will be wiping everything down too!
"We’re traveling next Wednesday. I have been in contact with Cheap Caribbean and Spirit. Spirit said we can cancel and they will offer us travel vouchers without any fees. Cheap Caribbean said it’s $50 each person plus 2 nights for the hotel. We have no travel insurance, I have never purchased it for any other trips and didn’t think about it.We plan on going. The only way we will stop is if there a travel ban. I’m just overly preparing myself - hand sanitizer, wipes, + anti-bacterial hand soap (rather the bar in the hotel room). Also making sure we have medicine in case we need any - all allowed within Mexico.We’re taking our young kids with us so it will be a challenge to remind them no hands in mouth, hands off face, or eyes. I will wipes things down on the plane that I normally would never think about. Trying to keep our spirits up and remain happy/excited for the trip- so our kids don’t worry either.Just like others have mention currently Mexico has less cases than US. But at the rate I personally think it has been around for awhile and we just need to be smart about it all."
"Wow, i can't believe Spirit is offering refunds - did you have the cheapest fare ticket with no changes? Thanks for reporting this. I don't think a ban will happen with Mexico anytime soon as I suspect that Mexico will not test widely, esp amongst tourists. If they aren't testing, there's nothing to report.Edited: 8:59 am, March 03, 2020 "
I contacted them via FB and asked out of curiosity (just want to have our ducks all lined up). They said normally it’s non-refundable but they would waive charges just this once for us and issue credit for the full tickets. But I reassured them we wouldn’t be doing anything drastic.
"NicholeT: I am in the same boat as you - got the insurance but now I can’t find any Lysol wipes, or sanitizer gels. I called my Costco and they said they can’ keep the stuff on shelves, it’s just flying off as soon as it is stocked. Shoppers (nothing), Canadian Tire (same thing). In Canada, our Minister of Health suggested everyone go out and ‘stock up’ on medications, canned food, sanitizer gel, Lysol etc. I can’t even find hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol. Don’t know what I’m going to disenfect my plane seat with. Thinking of asking my family doctor to write me a prescription for some alternative lotion or gel you can only get through a prescription - something like doctors/nurses in hospitals use. I have a few weeks to sort it out but feel bad for people traveling in days or a week from now. Hope you have better luck than me in obtaining what you need,"
"amyt8313: Thank you for your advice on checking out our Dollar Stores here in Canada. We are going through the exact same problems here. With everyone going on March Break, people are stocking up before they leave. I have a couple of weeks left to find some wipes and hand gel for the plane. I will phone around to the Dollar Stores and see if they’ve got anything on hand. It’s first come, first serve and no one is willing to ‘hold product’ for you. The Early Bied gets the worm as they say. Have a wonderful vacation, wash your hands diligently and just be careful at the buffets my TRavel is telling everyone. Safe travels.Edited: 12:51 pm, March 03, 2020 "
Hi I am on the same boat . My wedding is june 3rd in Mexico. And final payment ts for my guests are march 25th.. this deadline is cutting it close and as new cases emerge daily. I dont know what to do. I have a small window of time to just cancel my wedding but everyone lose thier deposits while some guests paid some in full..
"Arlene, if you've got a couple weeks to go maybe think of buying them online. Friends in Florida just ordered antibacterial gel, wipes, and hand soap from Amazon. A good price and quick delivery."
"2DCJ: I read your post and it brought tears to my eyes. Here is my advice from an old lady who has always loved to travel because life is such an adventure. PLEASE do not cancel your wedding for June 3rd. Don’t worry about new cases emerging. You and your wedding party will be fine. All this pandemonium. Is starting to ‘stop’ people from ‘just living’ their lives. My daughter from Dubai called today (I told her last week I intend to go ahead with my upcoming trip) and she practically begged me to cancel as I have insurance, and I told her like my favorite movie ‘Shirley Valentine’, at my age I need to live ‘life to the fullest”) and we hung up. So please (do an old lady a favor) don’ cancel your wedding date - this virus is going to go where it is going to go. Trust me, if things get that bad governments everywhere will restrict travel to certain countries and that is not on radar just yet. So let’s just follow good hygiene (I can’t believe how many people I see at Costco and Walmart and so many places people who are in such a hurry they won’t even take 30 seconds to wash their hands. So go to your dream wedding in wonderful Mexico and have a wonderful wedding experience, take lots of photos, and then do a review on TA so all of us can bear witness to that wonderful day. You GO GIRL!!!!!!!!!"
"JoanS: Oh my goodness Joan, I am so glad you reached out to me today. I intended to send you a post this evening and apologize for my earlier comments. I must be having a senior moment today (this crazy virus is having an affect on so many of us in a negative way). Please accept my apology. My intent I understand was easy to misinterpet and when I come to Cancun at the end of the month maybe I can take you to lunch at Mike’s to see if the pizza is as good as a New Yorker would know. Best regards,ArleneD."
"Thank you so much for your email and you are so sweet with your reassurances. This really meant alot to me as I was envisioning such an amazing wedding. This whole covid scare is getting me so anxious and it's hard as I feel like I need to worry about every one of my guests. A wedding is supposed to be a happy time in my life but as it comes closer it has made me uneasy. My mother is immunocompromised so I am making her look into travel insurance if she can maybe get a doctors note for cancellation due to her ongoing ailments if concerns increase in mexico. I want to be optimistic but also want to be prepared for anything that can happen. Aside from fears of lockdown and covid contraction, due to me being asian canadian, in the back of my mind i'm worried about the racism involved with the covid.. I shouldn't be having to think about these things and never thought I would have to. But oh well things happen!I have a couple of weeks to really think things though and discuss with my guests. Fingers crossed for it not get out of hand in Mexico and hope everyone out there safe travels."
"Arlene D, it's a deal! Apology accepted. And we don't have to go to Isla Mujeres for pizza. I know a very good place right in the hotel zone. Not Mike's Pizza good, but good."
"suppose to go to Puetra Vallarta in April, I'm healthy and not worried about getting sick, worried about getting stuck with no money and who takes care of my home in US"
@Tami We’re making sure we have a credit card available in case of an emergency while down there. Make sure you notify all banks of you traveling out of country if you plan on using your cards. The worse thing is an emergency happens and stuck because the bank blocks your cards.
"New this morning. Italy has closed all schools and universities amid surge in Coronavirus, through mid March. Yes, Italian airports will screen passengers going back to the States.... nothing said about passengers going to Mexico."
"JoanS: That sounds great to me - I’m a big pizza lover. So here’s to ‘starting over’ and I look forward to meeting you and enjoying your company. I travel solo, so it’s nice to know that in future when in Cancun I’ll have a new friend to call on. Touch base soon. Will contact you once I get to VIRM. As an aside, I wrote to my concierge at VIRM to ask about hand sanitizers and proactive steps the resort is taking to ‘keep germs at bay’ - waiting to hear back. Talk soon."
"2DCJ: Hi again. I do think it is important for your mom to have insurance as she has underlying medical issues. And, don’t worry about being Asian-Canadian, I am sure the resort guests want you to have a wonderful wedding experience (and if you should run into 1 or 2 people giving you the stink eye just ignore their ignorance) as most people do not blame the entire Asian community for this virus. So keep your chin up, think positive, be proactive with hygiene and you and your wedding party will be fine."
RaymondP: Thank you for your post and I agree with you totally.
Me too!
"""Italian airports will screen passengers going back to the States.... nothing said about passengers going to Mexico.""Not sure what the Italians are doing in regard to people going to Mexico but as of yet, Mexico has no restrictions on travelers coming from other countries and no country specific screening for those passengers coming from high risk countries such as China and South Korea. I do think they're asking if you've been to those countries recently (in some airports) but nothing like the 2 week quarantine in place in the US."
"With much disappointment, I cancelled my trip for departure today for a week to the IB Tucan. Having been there many times before and able to get full refund back with my travel insurance, thought it was best to be safe than sorry. I did not want to be with so many Europeans that come during this month to this resort, many who are lovely Italians but with many large families. Being that this has affected Italy with so many cases, and this resort is an all inclusive, thought it was best for me as a solo traveler to cancel. Many of the resorts cater to the Europeans because of the beauty of the area and the beaches, so many of the other all inclusive resorts will experience the same issue. I had 2 doctors advise me not to go, their feeling was of one of too much uncertainty of the virus. I guess time will play out, hopefully for the best for everyone."
"We are a group of 14 visiting from USA to Cancun 2nd week of March and we are travelling and hoping to have a great time. I am wishing and hoping those from Italy, Korea, Iran, China and Washington, California do not travel and spread it."
"It’s in 15 states in the US already, soon to be all, so if you’re from the US you’ll be the ones likely to spread it. An LAX screener just tested positive, imagine how many people got infected and then caught connecting domestic flights? Meanwhile, cases are going down in China"
How are things now that Mexico has confirmed cases ? I am scheduled to visit later this month.
"I’m leaning towards canceling and hopefully going September or October. While the weather might not be as great as mid April when I’m supposed to go it’s not worth the risk with my 87 year old grandmother and 1 year old with asthma. It is breaking our heart because I’d rather stay home than go and be worried the entire timeEdited: 8:02 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"""How are things now that Mexico has confirmed cases ? I am scheduled to visit later this month.""Well, there are no cases in Cancun (or the State of Quintana Roo for that matter) and the 5 confirmed cases in the country aren't anywhere near Cancun So aside from not being able to find any antibacterial wipes or gel in the stores and farmacias and some minor changes to the Catholic Mass (not offering the sign of peace in form of physical contact such as a handshake) normal life hasn't changed.It's business as usual here.Edited: 8:48 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"Hi Joan,I appreciate the updates. I will keep checking in for the next couple of months to ensure things are going smooth down in mexico quintana roo. I appreciate the locals opinions as they are the ones who are living and witnessing, rather than people who are assuming and hyping things up."
Is there any reported deaths in Cancun due to Coronavirus? Also how wide spread and reported cases? Where can I find this from a reliable source and from special interest group? Thank You!
"Reply to Post #271...Hi Skip,No deaths in Cancun due to COVID-19 because so far, there are no confirmed cases anywhere in the state of Quintana Roo.The Health Secretary Alejandra Aguirre Crespo has confirmed to the media that they are monitoring a suspected case of the COVID-19 in the state of Quintana Roo.Here's a summary of cases in Mexico...On 28 February, Mexico confirmed its first three cases. A 35-year-old man and a 59-year-old man in Mexico City and a 41-year-old man in the northern state of Sinaloa tested positive and were held in isolation at a hospital and a hotel, respectively. They both had travelled to Bergamo and stayed in Italy for a week in mid-February. On 29 February, a 4th case was detected and confirmed on the city of Torreon, in the state of Coahuila, from a 20-year-old woman who traveled to Italy. On 1 March, a 5th case was announced in Chiapas in a student who had just returned from Italy.I follow the websites of medical/health organisations, for example CDC, WHO, etc.Edited: 9:51 am, March 05, 2020 "
"I am not trying to scare anyone including myself. The world news report yesterday, there are 2 cases in Cancun. Can anyone confirm this? Also, from the U.S. Sun website (https:/…) ""Mexico has at least three Covid-19 cases including one in party resort Cancun, which is expecting thousands of US Spring Breakers in the coming weeks."" I am getting concern, we are leaving end of March."
"I can’t find anything on the news about Cancun.. does anyone have any reliable links?Edit to add: I found this- https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.travelpulse…Edited: 9:59 am, March 05, 2020 "
Thank You Maegan for finding the link! That's a little comfort to know that there isn't any cases. Coronavirus has ruined my excitement of going to AI for the first time!!! ;(
They tested negative
"@Maegan Same here, my fiance is freaking out. I am trying to stay positive as much as I can and monitor the situation closely. If we have to make a decision at the last minute to cancel and lost money, so be it. For now, I am on here everyday to see updates. I am thankful to all info that has been sharing here. I believe if you contact it, it isn't life threatening but you need to go through an inconvenience of being quarantine for 14 days. Hope for the best!!!"
"An article in the newspaper London Free Press said this morning that the vast majority who get this virus have very mild symptoms. More like a cold or mild flu. If you are sick or your immune system is compromised then that would be a reason to stay home. We are heading to Florida on the 24th and have no intentions of canceling. I'm heading to Los Angeles with my brother and son on April 14th to see Pearl Jam. My biggest worry is they'll cancel the concert. We are taking the proper measures such as washing hands regularly etc. Other than that life goes on. The sky is not falling, at least not yet.I would advise if you haven't got the flu shot then get it. Sounds like it would offer some protection.Edited: 11:39 am, March 05, 2020 "
"Not trying to scare anyone, but I am taking a dispassionate and somewhat logical view to this. Going by what we know now, I would personally assume the virus is pretty much everywhere and chances of getting it probably are the same wherever we are located. In my home state, 2 college students landed Tuesday at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. They had been in close contact with a third traveler in Europe who had been diagnosed with the virus. Neither of the students that came in showed any symptoms and were allowed in, but both are under 2 weeks of self quarantine. Other travelers on the flight will be notified if either of the two is diagnosed with the virus. So in the interim, we could have potential carriers mingling with the rest of the population. Similar scenarios are undoubtedly being replicated all over the country with colleges recalling their students from study abroad programs. Its best to assume that every thing is infected and act accordingly. Even within my home, I am continuously wiping down, washing hands and disinfecting everything. Majority that become infected may not show any symptoms and will not get tested. Kids especially, and they are in close contact at school. I plan to go on my vacation to Cancun. However, everybody's situation is different. Going by the risk factors, if I was over the age of 65 and not in good health or have a compromised immune system, I would not be travelling.Edited: 11:49 am, March 05, 2020 "
Just to ad to the above. In the same article it said there are lot of cases not being reported due to no symptoms or very mild ones. This makes the death toll much smaller.
"@Leidback: I agree and I like your logic in this situation and not letting it ruin your vacation. We are not in 65+ so ""YES"" we are going. :) @Kateman Yup, not a life threatening but I will take extra precautions just like I do with flu & cold if you don't want to get sick. This year, my fiance & my daughter got sick from the influenza b and were off work & school for the entire week. I didn't get it at all while taking care of them. I think my daily Probiotic paid off. I now make them take it everyday."

"Hello Friends,we want to travel to Cancun from Vancouver in Mid-April all-inclusive hotel. I am worried in terms of Coronavirus spreading in the pools of the hotel, beaches and etc. what do you think?Thank you so much"
"@pegah m, There is someone share a very informative info about Pool & Buffet at the resort. But there are so many pages here already, I would try search this forum. The search bar is under where you post a message.Edited: search didn't help much, I guess you need to go through each page.Edited: 12:43 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"I would not get worked up about anything reported in The Sun. That publication isn't exactly known for hard news and reporting truthfully. They're all about sensationalism. As of this am, the local news here in Cancun says we continue to be free of the virus as does the State as a whole. There were 2 suspected cases in PDC but they were tested immediately and the results were negative."
"@Joan S, Great News!!! Thank you always for your useful information."
"""we want to travel to Cancun from Vancouver in Mid-April all-inclusive hotel. I am worried in terms of Coronavirus spreading in the pools of the hotel, beaches and etc. what do you think?""Here is what was posted by justinkinne on another thread on the subject of pools:In regards to the swimming pools at the resorts. Chlorine is a tricky thing in a swimming pool. Its more effective at lower pH values. Its also dependent on how much chlorine is in the swimming pool. Sunlight can cause chlorine to burn out quickly. All factors to consider. The CDC sets the bar here in the US at 1ppm of chlorine and then lists kill times for different ""bugs"" common for swimming pools. I have been a certified pool operator for 20 years, so I have some experience with all of these bugs! So at a 1ppm chlorine will kill e coli in less than a minute, Hepatitis A takes about 16 minutes, Giardia takes 45 minutes. Hepatitis being the only virus in that group. Now a couple of notes. The more chlorine, the quicker the kill times. Normal pool operators will keep chlorine around 3 ppm, not 1 ppm. So most viruses will be killed off in a pool in less than 5 minutes, at a chlorine reading of 3ppm. I cannot speak specifically to CoVid19. But I would feel safe getting in a pool with a good chlorine reading. I would make sure to stay in the pool for 20 minutes or longer to know that anything on me would be killed by the chlorine before I got out. Resort pools are also routinely ""shocked"". meaning they bring the chlorine up to 10 or 20 ppm overnight to make sure they are clean at the start of each day. You can imagine any of these ""bugs"" will give you the exact same symptoms as say food poisoning or in Mexico, Montazuma's Revenge! This is a bad look for resorts, especially in MX with the water issues of the past. So they pay extra special attention to the pools. My advice is to enjoy the pools, but stay away from a pool that is hazy, cloudy or visibly dirty.Link to the CDC chlorine in pools kill time charts.https:/…disinfection-testing.html"
Thank you so much. I will search. Please send it to me if you find it.
Thank you so much. it was a great explanation.
"Re Post 286...Hi Pegah,I wouldn't worry too much about pools & beaches -- it's almost everything else you come into contact with that you have to be concerned with. And the trip on the flying petri dish (airplane) should be your greatest concern.All you can do is follow the recommended precautions which I'm sure someone has mentioned already (I haven't been following this thread) -- frequent hand washing with soap & water, avoid touching your face unless your hands are clean, etc. etc. etc....."

"Thanks MisterB266,this is a large thread lol!!!"
Fabulous!!! I think we should all stop freaking out and just be careful as we always should be :) ...makes sense and so nice to hear from someone who knows these ropes!! Enjoy & Party On ☀️'s!
"JoanS: Joan, I just want to say thank goodness for your ""sound reporting"" as your advice is appreciated by many people who rely on the experts. I just can't believe so many travellers are not prepared or informed of what they need to know. You are becoming (without even knowing it) ""an ocean of calm"" in a sea of unknowns. So keep ""keeping us abreast"" of what really matters in Cancun. Let's not let ""paranoia"" and ""mis-information"" keep the FACTS from getting out. Your expertise in the Cancun forum is reassuring and calming to many of us."
"Much as gracias, Arlene!!!I appreciate your very kind words."
"Hi Joan,thanks so much for all the information you shared. We are scheduled to leave for Cancun on Monday. Do you know if they are taking any extra measures to screen tourists coming from other countries, especially the ones that have outbreaks? I cannot find any details on that anywhere... thanks so much!"
"Traveler L, they are not as of last night.Although I did read where they're going to have a drill at the airport in the near future to make sure they're equipped if someone with the virus arrived via air.No mention as to how they would know this though. Friends of mine arrived yesterday on two different flight. One was asked if she had been to any of the countries hardest hit (specifically China and South Korea) and the other was was not. They saw no other measures being taken.Edited: 10:46 am, March 06, 2020 "
Thank you so much for the reply
"Thank you, Joan S. Appreciate your response."
"It's a lot of pressure to put on Joan or anyone else -- for those who are choosing to travel please do so knowing how incomplete ALL of our information is at this point (even the U.S. government doesn't have enough tests so who knows what's going on in MX) and Joan is not saying that it's safe to travel to CUN. She has expressed repeated concern that MX has not restricted travel from Italy, China, S Korea, etc. I just don't want people putting this much responsibility on her, it's not really fair, esp if things go badly."
"@savvychic-travels; i don't think anyone is putting the responsibilty on Joan and I don't believe for one second she is assuming the risk for anyone but herself. It will be foolhardy in any sense to do so. Most are just trying to gather sufficient information to make the best decision they can at this time. For those like me who have decided to travel, its very simple. I have made the determination that the risk is not significantly greater than what I potentially face at home. We all have varying levels of risk tolerance and have made informed decisions based on what we know. I like to use investments as an example. Some are heavily invested in stocks with potentially higher risks and higher returns. Others are risk averse and hold their investments in bonds and cash with relatively lower risks and lower returns. Here's one of my favorite Charles Dickens quotes from A Christmas Carol “You are fettered,"" said Scrooge, trembling. ""Tell me why?""""I wear the chain I forged in life,"" replied the Ghost. ""I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it.” We are all responsible for the choices we make!"
"savvychick-travels and Leidback, You are both right. I am absolutely NOT saying it's safe to travel here and I'm NOT saying that it isn't safe. I will post links to what I read and let you know what are local officials are saying and doing about the situation. But that's it.It's up to each individual person or family to decide whether to come or not. Even my friends in the States don't expect me to make the decision for them. And for the record, I don't feel like anyone here is doing that either. Just to avoid getting a bunch of PM's, one group of my friends did come. The other cancelled."
"For those of you who may be interested, I posted 3 news articles that were published in the local paper today in this thread:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g15080…"
we are going April 2nd so watching carefully too
Hi. We are suppose to go to Cancun April 4. We are concerned to with all going on. We can cancel with a full refund if we have to. Going to watch closely next few weeks. Just wondering if Cancun airport is checking people at all coming in.
">> ""Just wondering if Cancun airport is checking people at all coming in.""So far, I haven't heard of this happening, but during one of the previous virus outbreaks, passengers leaving from Cancun airport had their temperatures taken before being allowed to check-in -- took an extra 10 minutes or so. I don't know if arriving passengers had to go through this. It is a possibility if the situation worsens.Edited: 7:49 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"Lydon, they are not doing any checks on arriving flights at this point. They may be looking at people a bit more closely and possibly talking to the personel on the plane to see if anyone is visibly ill. But you wouldn't see it or know that. No specific checks like for fever or anything to the arriving passengers."
sounds good a nice long vacation
I've been watching this thread and others. Reading a lot of articles especially when it involves experts such as MDS. This seems to be a disease that can spread quickly with mild symptoms or none in healthy individuals. I read where one person said about traveling and bringing it back to her elderly parents. Maybe a trip to the grocery store would have the same effect. Hibernate if that's how you feel and no disrespect. We have reservations for later this month and in April traveling to the U.S. and we are not worried. Mexico is different story due what happens if you are quarantined.
"Since many are worried about travels from other countries that have severe outbreak. The prime minister is putting a lockdown on travels for most of Northern Italy. I’m pretty positive that includes traveling out of the country won’t be allowed.We’re still on track to leave in a few days. The fear and worry is disappearing a bit. I’m going to try my best to not constantly watch the news and freak out while I’m away. However, I did make sure we have some stuff stocked up in our house in case anything major happens when we get home."
"Leidback: I loved reading your post and I agree we ‘all have free will’ and each of us must decide what is best for us moving forward. I have decided, come hell or high water I’m coming. My daughter calls daily with bad news from Dubai, (funny when you become a senior your children suddenly become the adults in the room and want to treat YOU like the child - ha! ha!) but on March 30th, I’m coming for 2 weeks in paradise at the VIRM. I emailed my concierge at the Valentin, and he has assured me that I am going to be in good hands. Plenty of hand sanitizers and all staff being vigilant with food preparations. So nothing could stop me from coming, unless they close the border. And I’m a bit of a gambler too, and I have decided to ‘let it ride’ with my Index Funds - But who knows like everything in life, I may move into more ‘safe investments’ but at my age, I say, nothing is certain in life except death - ha! ha!Edited: 5:14 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"JoanS: I know you must be swamped with all these inquiries, but if you could keep us ‘updated’ on what’s happening at the Cancun Airport, it would be much appreciated. I have checked their online and there is no mention of what they are doing about travelers from Italy, South Korea or China. Any news on that front would be much appreciated. Keep up the good work, so many of us travelers are depending on your ‘solid and informed’ opinion."
"""The prime minister is putting a lockdown on travels for most of Northern Italy.""That should have ZERO relevance for travel to Cancun in the immediate future.According to this source Italy has over 7300 cases:https:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6Not mentioned is how many cases of the annual flu have they had in the same time frame.Mexico has seven reported cases. Does anyone honestly expect a travel ban to Cancun at this time? I don't.Add in my view is that this is a politicized media driven hysteria event. It won't last forever. Just until it no longer serves their agenda or another ""crisis"" develops."
"@copoilt - I was just mentioning it because several people have come on here worrying about what’s being done for people traveling from countries with major outbreaks. Rather Mexico has 0 or 100 people are still concerned, which is fine. If you’re not concerned that’s your opinion. If others want to be concerned then let them be."
Concern is one thing. Hysteria is another. I can't tell where some people are traveling FROM. I am discussing traveling TO Cancun. I will continue to provide my opinion.
"Maegan,Feel free to ignore his “opinion” driven by an extremist political agenda that has little to do with the current public health situation. Yes, 16 million quarantined today in Italy because of concerns about virulent Covid-19. The repeated mention of the flu by some is a red herring that, again, seems to be strangely driven by politics. The Italy quarantine certainly has to do with Cancun since, until perhaps very recently, Mexico was not restricting incoming tourists from hot spots. That Italy is self-quarantining may help Cancun and elsewhere, though that train may have already left the station. As always, keeping abreast of WHO, CDC, and your local health department’s updates is the best plan. As I make my decision, I know I’ll be considering my risks in Mexico as well as my own potential for exposure at home such that I try my best not to carry it with me, putting the elderly and immunocompromised at risk.Edited: 6:46 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"You make a good point but current major health officials are saying for the most part this is a mild Illness for healthy individuals, including some that don't develop symptoms. You can""t ignore that. Yes, don't go to the hot spots and Cancun isn't one of them. If you are worried about bringing it back to the the most vulnerable then in my opinion stay home. This isn't a crisis in Mexico at this time. Questionable if it's anywhere. Co Pilot does makes a good point in my opinion.. Dr. Drew blames the media for over doing this and making it worse than it is. Yes I know, consider the source!! Personally I wouldn't make a reservation to go to Mexico at this time because I question their health care system. That's just me from experience. If I had a reservation, then I'd stick with it.I have no problem traveling in Canada or the U.S. We are going later this month to Orlando and next month Los Angeles. I have no problem trusting the U.S. health care system. Again Mexico, not so much."
Well my mayor just announced nyc employees cannot do unnecessary international travel. See how well that goes. Im booked for my birthday next month.
"The politics is from leftists and the media...but they are the same.Look at facts and the reaction to this virus is out of proportion to the risks. If Italy chooses to quarantine a region of their country, that is their choice. Perhaps they should have banned people coming in from China earlier.Look at the odds of being in close proximity to an coronavirus infected person on your plane. I would guess it is 2000 to 1.Regular flu contact may be even odds.If you wish, use often mentioned disinfecting procedures and see if any readily available masks protect you from airborne virus.Edited: 7:36 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"Kateman,Most definitely consider the source with “Dr. Drew”, lol. I hope that we all are considering our risk of being this to the most vulnerable and not just our own personal or our family’s risk. I think of that as part of each of our responsibilities to our fellow humans. I am hoping to go. If cases in my region rise significantly as they have in other hot spots, I will reconsider, without the need for an imposed travel ban."
"“ Look at the odds of being in close proximity to an coronavirus infected person on your plane. I would guess it is 2000 to 1.Regular flu contact may be even odds.” Love those uninformed hunches. People with flu are not contagious before they’re symptomatic. Few to none would dare try to fly with flu now, as they never should have. I have no idea what my odds are of sitting next to someone with Covid-19 (or of someone else sitting next to me if I’m pre-symptomatic). The odds would certainly vary by airport location. Throwing out some arbitrary number is not operating in statistics or science."
"Looks like this hospital in Far Rockaway, Queens was following Co-Pilots flu theory and hunches about hysteria. Now they’re out 40 of their frontline medical responders for their carelessness:https:/…coronavirus-new-york-queens.amp.html"

"Funinthesun,I’m getting my coronavirus information from the CDC, WHO, Johns Hopkins, NIH, The NYT and the Washington Post. “Fake” news sources like that. I have certainly been no fear mongerer and am hardly a troll because I find your posts laughable. The biggest professional tennis tournament after the four majors, Indian Wells, was just cancelled upon advice from public health officials out of concern about the spread of Covid-19. Two Republican members of Congress are now quarantining, with one having staff do the same with his office closed down. The World Bank cancelled its spring meeting, along with numerous other large gatherings cancelled. These were not because they did so due to the influence of CNN. They did so in consultation with public health authorities. I just read on another thread that Cancun has it’s first known case. I haven’t found a source for that yet. People need to weigh they’re own decisions based on factors such as their own risk factors and anxiety tolerance, knowledge of and faith in Cancun medical care if needed, faith in Mexican authorities to report accurately and not just in a way that protects their tourist industry, their medical coverage abroad, their workplace and school policies with regard to international travel right now, and public health recommendations at their time of travel. Pretending there is not a grand scale public health concern or that it’s a different concern (hey, look over here) serves no one. It is efforts to address it that will help mitigate and contain it such that it doesn’t become a crisis."
"Wonder how this ranks among long threads on TA?I received a message from Delta today about their procedures around the virus. Here is the link: https://news.delta.com/6-ways-delta-supporti…Also, something that I meant to post a few days ago:If you are traveling to the area and are concerned about healthcare, give your insurance company a call to see what their deal is when you are overseas. We have BCBS through the US Federal Govt (wife is a fed). Our plan covers care everywhere in the world and outside the US, everything is considered in-network. While you may need to pay up front and get reimbursed, they do claim that they do direct bill. Whether folks at Cancun hospitals will honor the direct bill is another story. This is the website for overseas coverage: https://www.gmmi.com/fep-provider-search"
"I just saw this on FB from a public health expert and thought it was great so sharing: “Here’s the maddening but beautiful thing about public health and infectious disease prevention, though: if we do all that we need to do...we’ll get back to normal sooner than if we either look away or freak out. If we do everything we need to do, it’ll look like we needn’t have done all this in the first place because the outbreak won’t be a big deal. Prevention is wacky that way.”"
"Source: https:/…preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm""CDC estimates* that, from October 1, 2019, through February 29, 2020, there have been: 20,000 - 52,000 flu deaths.""At least half of those appear by one chart to be after 1 January...historically. So we will use 10,000 to 26,000 flu deaths in the USA this year.US coronavirus deaths are at 21 per this source:https:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6I believe that 14 of those were in one nursing care/long term care type facility.Perspective matters. Hysteria is not warranted."
We are here now.. no reported cases here in Cancun . No one here is in high alert . Employees are being given basic instructions. I have more concerns going home toNYC! I imagine it’s possible that they will screen people coming into Mexico at this time
"You love the word “hysteria”. What does counteracting a different public health situation have to do with the flu and what does it have to do with hysteria? Should we ignore dengue or Ebola because there are more flu deaths? We don’t know how many Covid-19 deaths there will be after its first year. Hopefully, there will be far fewer because appropriate public health containment measures have been taken."
"Gwen J,I just returned from NYC. Business as usual, for the most part, though cancellations are starting (including DC to NYC Acela service). I stayed at an upper east side hotel, which had plenty of tourists, both international and domestic. A favorite high end Italian restaurant was as packed as always. In general, things felt a little quieter than I’d expect on a weekend. I’m not sure what you’ll face at Immigration and Customs. Probably nothing special coming from Mexico."
"CO Pilot, To you, not sure how old you are. I have been reading your posts for many years....have valued much of your information. However, that said, I am a 65 year old married female, probably travel to a PDC at least 3 times a year solo for a week at a time to an AI. Just some wisdom from the last 10 years of traveling there. I would be cautious about the Coronavirus because of my age and travel to still a third world destination. I also feel due to the popularity of the prices and beautiful resorts, I think some of the airlines and resorts have become complacent in their treatment of tourists with respect to hygiene and safety. I would not want to get sick down there at my age and be sent to a medical facility or quarantine facility. That said, the airlines have been flying packed full flights down there and several times have been disgusted at the cleanliness of the airline tray tables with throw up still on it when seated....and gum and candy stuck on seatbelts and tray tables. Unfortunately that is not a vote of confidence on your trip to Paradise. That said, flight attendants have their hands full with full flights, unruly passengers, and unsanitary seating areas. More than anything, I don’t want to come back from Mexico with any known symptoms or even symptoms that weren’t checked at the airport...and visit my 90 year old mother or 10 year old grandchild. Yes, I need to be prudent in my choices on who, when, and where I visit, but I also think that airlines and airports and resorts can do a better job of cleaning and screening....which so far, Cancun and Cozumel has done none."

How was your trip in cancun? Did you go or cancel it?
"Joan, that report is from January. I recall reading it at that time, and it was later concluded that it wasn't COVID-19.Here are the confirmed cases in Mexico so far...On 28 February, Mexico confirmed its first three cases. A 35-year-old man and a 59-year-old man in Mexico City and a 41-year-old man in the northern state of Sinaloa tested positive and were held in isolation at a hospital and a hotel, respectively. They both had travelled to Bergamo and stayed in Italy for a week in mid-February.On 29 February, a 4th case was detected and confirmed on the city of Torreon, in the state of Coahuila, from a 20-year-old woman who traveled to Italy.On 1 March, a 5th case was announced in Chiapas in a student who had just returned from Italy.On 6 March, a 6th case was confirmed in the State of Mexico in a 71 year old man who had returned from Italy the 21st of February.On 7 March, a 7th case was also confirmed in Mexico City in a 46 year old male who had previously had contact with another confirmed case in the United States.Edited: 12:06 pm, March 09, 2020 "
Thanks MisterB. I asked that it be removed.
"Leidback, That is all such great advice. Perhaps this would be a good time for those in the know to recommend top doctors, clinics, hospitals in Cancun. I’m sure it’s listed elsewhere. I’d love to see it here, though."
"funinthesun, it seems to me your being the troll here. ReviewerMaryland has been a long time great source of information about traveling to the area, and I for one appreciate her views and info. very much.I don't think she's being hysterical at all. The stock market is down about 1,600 points today; guess that's more CNN fake news, too?"
"Being one of those who has decided to proceed with my trip to Cancun, this thought crossed my mind. How would I feel if I was an employee of one of the resorts? Personally, I'd be terrified with the thought of hordes of tourists descending on Cancun from all over the world. What are the chances that one or more are infected with Covid19? Its a double edged sword. If they don't come, I can't earn a living. If they come, I could be at risk. I'd just have to practice the specified safety measures and hope for the best. Anyways, I think it would be nice for us tourists to show some extra love and appreciation to these folks. I plan to do so when I'm there for my vacation."
I have a feeling a lot of those people at the resorts in Mexico are more worried about losing their jobs then this virus. Considering what they make it would not be easy for them to function if we quit going and they lose their job because the resort can’t afford to pay them
"@ Carol A, I hear you on the probable greater concern for their jobs. But then, that's a situation that really makes one heart ache."
"Leidback,I totally get what you’re saying. It makes you think about the bigger picture, even being at home!!"
"""The stock market is down about 1,600 points today; guess that's more CNN fake news, too?""That is due to the Saudi Arabia/Russia oil situation. It will pass. Gas prices will drop at the pumps. Airline will pat less for fuel which is a major cost."
"Pay...not ""pat."""
"“Its a double edged sword. If they don't come, I can't earn a living. If they come, I could be at risk. I'd just have to practice the specified safety measures and hope for the best. Anyways, I think it would be nice for us tourists to show some extra love and appreciation to these folks. I plan to do so when I'm there for my vacation.”Very well said. This has been on my mind throughout—my privilege that i am in good health, get to decide whether to travel or not, whether to go to the office or work from home...that I have the funds to stock up on food/supplies and access to great medical care. There are so many who have far more at stake."
"@ReviewerMaryland1, this is so true. At a time when we are fretting over the decision to cancel or not cancel a few thousand dollars vacation, others are wondering if they will make rent or put food on the table for their kids. Life just ain't fair!"
We are going to Hyatt Ziva Cancun March 27th. I could not be any less concerned about the damn virus but I am starting to grow a little concerned that Mexico or the US will put a travel ban in place.
"I'm hoping to go next week...but not to a big AI (not because I wouldn't but because I don't like crowds). I wouldn't put off my plans if I were you...look at the John's Hopkins Map, do some research on populations of areas effected and figure out for yourself how TINY the percentages of people affected by this are...IMHO that will make you really think twice about not going. IMHO your biggest worry is overstepping that may take place by either government under political pressure...not the actual virus."
"ReviewerMaryland1: I’m with you. Funinthesun is laughable. I subscribe to the NYT, the Washington Post, The Atlantic and the Nation. I watch CNN every day and they are not fake news as Trump says. New CNN polls today done from March 4-7 say Trump’s handling of this pandemic is at 39%. Pretty pathetic. That is why markets crashed today (cheap gas is no panacea when people are afraid to leave their homes). I am not a gambler, but a political junkie of 45 years, and I think this pandemic will be Trump’s Katrina and his Waterloo."
"I just got back from Cancun last night, and there is no concern over the corona virus there"
"Leidback: Thank you so much for your kind post and more so, for the advice you offered. I do have excellent insurance (as long as I call them in advance of any care needs I might require, it then kicks in up to Canadian 5 million dollars) and I do have several Visa cards, so in case the facility wants payment up front, that shouldn’t be a problem. Basically, I’m in good heath, just turned 70 (but could pass for 55 as my recent TA screen photo shows) but I have no underlying conditions like diabetes, heart or lung conditions. I have arthritis, but who doesn’t at my age. My daughter reads too much ‘garbage ’ on Facebook that’s her problem. I trust reliable news outlets and trusted publications as I have mentioned. So thanks again for your advice and for concern for this ‘young old lady’. So, here’s to Paradise waiting and some good Tequila to make my 2 weeks of Paradise - the best ever!!!"
"""I just got back from Cancun last night, and there is no concern over the corona virus there""I've read this same statement several times in this thread and others about the virus. And I haven't said anything but I'm going to now.This is statement is absolutely not true. To say that the virus is of no concern here is misinformation.People here are not panicking. That is definitely true. But there is concern here. Honestly, how could there not be? Do you really think that resort, bar, club, and restaurant employees are going to share their personal concerns with guests? Of course they're not.Some resorts (I know of three) have instructed their employees not to discuss the situation so as not to create a panic. But people are taking it seriously. You may not see the precautions the resorts (and the airport) have implemented but they're there. Same for the individual employees. Just try and buy a bottle of antibacterial gel here. You can't. But I'm willing to bet you'd find a lot more than normal in the lockers of the resort employees.This is a tourist town after all. I don't know a single person who is in some way connected to the tourist attraction industry who hasn't thought about the ramifications of people either cancelling their trips for whatever the reason. Whatever you thought of it, people still remember what the Zuma virus did to tourism here. Employees aren't going to feed into people's insecurity. That's not to say they're keeping info from you. They aren't. Thankfully though there's really no info to give at this point. Cancun is still virus free. But to say there's no concern is absolutely not accurate. The hotel association has regular meetings to ensure that the resorts know the latest protocol and are doing what they need to go protect their workers and their guests. Same at the airport. Same with the bars, restaurants and clubs. Just because people aren't discussing the situation 247 doesn't mean they're not concerned. It just means they're not panickng and going about business as usual while at the same time being careful to protect themselves and the guests."
"Joan,We need a ❤️ button for your posts!"
"JoanS: Thanks for the post. Of course, it stands to reason that resort employees have been told to (as the old Bing Crosby song says): “You have to ‘Accentuate the Positive, Eliminate the Negative’”,and let’s be honest ‘it’s above their pay grade’. The fact is: Every traveler (as with all health care issues) has to be their own advocate, and use their own judgement. We all have ‘free will’ and at the end of the day, as far as I’m concerned, life is just a ‘crap shoot’, it is random (wrong place, wrong time) and no one should put their ‘life on hold’ and if you talk to old dying people, their number #1 regret in life was “not taking chances in life and living in the moment“ - maybe something all of us on TA should consider. LIFE IS FOR THE LIVING!!!!"
"364. I agree totally, she deserves a ‘love button’ and so do you, by the way. You are informed, intelligent, and even though many posters might ‘agree to disagree with some of your posts’,’ no one doubts your honesty and contributions to this board. So, you get a love ❤️ button too!!!!!!!!"
"Leidback: I’m with you all the way. It just so, happens (as all my TA Reviews speak to) I have always been a big tipper (after working in the restaurant sector in Toronto through high school - Fran’s Restaurant for any of you old folks on this thread) and you rely on tips, so I travel with lots of ‘tip money’ wherever I go. I just believe as ELLEN says ‘In Paying it Forward’ and being kind to those you encounter. I even tip the gardening staff, the guys raking up the sargassum on the beach, the ladies keeping the washrooms clean as I understand they deserve recognition too. Of course I am in a position to be generous, and that’s why I am. Just tip what you can afford and be kind to all staff and employees. Trust me, they remember who’s nice and who’s a good tipper and those who don’t. I never wait more than 5 minutes for a drink on the beach - ha! ha!"
"""Just because people aren't discussing the situation 247 doesn't mean they're not concerned.

"Leidback: Oh, The Great Creator loves you. Your mother has a ‘good son’ and there’s nothing wrong with ‘Mama Boys’. I grew up in Toronto in a 90% Jewish neighborhood (between 2 synagogues) and believe me, I know ‘Mama’s Boys’ and they are the ‘best’. My son who loves me to death, would never want to admit that he ‘is one’ but truth be told he is. That just goes to prove I did a good job of raising him - Mama Knows Best - ha! ha!"
"To Joan, just curious. Do you think maybe there are no confirmed cases in Cancun maybe due to the fact the amount of testing kits or the labs are NOT readily available to the mass public and tourists? We have just been able to get the large number of tests and lab sites set up for the US.... having a dentist and surgeon in my family, I would be hesitant to say they are well equipped for testing in Cancun or Cozumel."
"@bcbdent, in my humble opinion, I don't think the situation is any different in Mexico than in the US. In both countries, they are only testing people who present with specified symptoms. Neither country is conducting mass testing. It has been in the news that Mexico has tested several individuals and found some positive and at least one negative that I've heard of. They have the capabilities to test and detect and diagnose and arguably had reliable test kits sourced from WHO before the U.S. could independently develop our own test kit (government insisted on using ours even though China, WHO, SK and others had reliable tests). If there becomes a need to test millions of people in a short period, then yes, the US is better equipped. But in reality, they are only testing the folks that show up with symptoms and those that have been in contact with them. Testing is not available to the mass public, even here in the US unless you have the symptoms. If someone shows up in the ER in the US with a simple cold, they will be sent home without testing even though in reality, that may be that persons mild reaction/symptoms to the virus. There are no confirmed cases because no one has showed up with the symptoms to warrant testing; same process as in the US.Edited: 8:38 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"What Leidback said.......Edited: 9:21 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Not sure if you are from Minnesota, but in Colorado where we today now have 11 confirmed cases, our state has taken a very aggressive approach to testing. It reads” the sooner we identify positive cases, regardless of severity of illness, the more effectively we can limit and slow the spread. Colorado is testing suspect cases who have milder illness and are not hospitalized.” Our state will also require the health insurers to fully cover testing for the virus. Not sure if Mexico would be quite up to that standard."
"We really won't know until it becomes a big issue here. Thankfully, right now, it isn't."
"Even in Colorado with a more aggressive testing protocol, they can only test those who present themselves to a medical facility. How many people with a common cold or even a cough are going in to get tested? These are potentially the beginning symptoms of covid19? Influenza? Some other virus? My guess is not many go in for a docs visit for a common cold. It would in fact be impractical and overwhelm medical facilities.I would guess the testing protocol for mild symptoms has some prioritization with a minimum threshold that specifies a combination of criteria including symptoms + recent visit to a high risk area or exposure to someone who has recently visited a high risk area. In Minnesota, the last person diagnosed has very mild symptoms and is quarantined at home. No hospitalization required as there is really no cure for this and they are reserving hospital space for the really sick folks. My opinion has been that the level of risk of exposure is really now in the hands of the individual, and the government has been saying this in coded language. The person who practices social distancing, washes/sanitizes their hands frequently, does not touch their face, cleans frequently, is in reasonably good health etc is less at risk than the person who doesn't. Your geographical location is really less of factor because this thing is potentially everywhere already."
"I do think it’s ...unusual that the Mexico cases have seen no increase. I haven’t seen that elsewhere, including in my home state where 3 quickly became 5 with about 10 more presumptive positives within 2 days...some from additional cruise ships and some community spread. I can only assume that Mexico’s cases not multiplying is from lack of testing."
"@ReviewerMaryland1I apologize for my comment. I know everyone is entitled to their opinion and so am I.

Just quarantine everyone for a month or two until the virus dies out in the USA and keep international travel shut down until it goes away for the season or forever?I am being extra careful and don't expect any government agency to assume that responsibility.It would be useful to suspend travel from a few countries, citizens from those countries or establish testing of anyone who has been there recently. Beyond that, and suitable quarantines, what proactive steps would someone take to get ahead of this virus knowing that many measures might not be acceptable to a free society.Edited: 7:08 am, March 10, 2020 "
"I don’t think it’s lack of testing. I think it’s people having mild symptoms and not going in for testing. They have said somewhere around 70% of cases were mild. It makes you think about who is walking around with the illness, but think it’s just a cold. I heard on the news from an ER doctor in DC that anyone who comes in now with symptoms (even though they mirror flu symptoms) will be pushed to get tested. I imagine for the states that have cases they are no longer restricting testing to just those who have traveled overseas/infected cruise ships."
"I’m currently in Cancun (3/10/20) staying in an all inclusive resort.I believe there has been one confirmed case here now.The threat I perceive comes from being in relatively close quarters with a wide assortment of foreign nationals. Most resorts operate buffets to serve food. For those infected, an obvious means to infect others. It’s curious to me that Cancun has stayed virtually unaffected. It might be the temps and humidity that stifle the transmission. Hopefully that’s true and warming temps elsewhere will slow the spread.My advice is to go but practice vigilance and bring hand sanitizer. Keep it with you always and disinfect frequently. Your biggest exposure threat will be the flight getting to and from. We’re leaving today and hope we’re not sitting close to anyone coughing and sneezing.Btw, it has shocked me watching mature folks walking around coughing and sneezing while making zero attempt to cover. With all the attention and media certain types remain clueless!"
"Hi Tanya, Maybe people should follow the facts more closely when posting information when their own health officials already announced Mexico has cases, not specific to where in Mexico the cases are located. "" https://www.mexicanist.com/l/coronavirus"" There are 7 confirmed positive cases a total of 12 but 5 not confirmed yet positive as of yet. The citizens were traveling abroad. If you take extra precautions with sanitizing you should be fine. The CDC has a list of things to do to help you stay healthy and prevent infection. I would not cancel the trip, follow CDC rules and enjoy your vacation. The CDC also has a list of countries to be wary of. Have a fun and safe trip!"
"The biggest mystery to me, about this virus, is the lack of significant occurrence amongst young children. Below are extracts from a demographic analysis of the infected population in China. The WHO mission reported a relatively low incidence in people under 18, who made up only 2.4% of all reported cases. In fact, through mid-January, zero children in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, had contracted Covid-19. It’s not clear whether that’s because children do not show signs of illness even if infected. Even cases among children and teens aged 10 to 19 are rare. As of Feb. 11 there were 549 cases in that age group, 1.2% of the total, China CDC found. only one had died. The vast majority of cases in China — 87% — were in people ages 30 to 79, the China Center for Disease Control reported last month based on data from all 72,314 of those diagnosed with Covid-19 as of Feb. 11. Overall, China CDC found, 2.3% of confirmed cases died. But the fatality rate was 14.8% in people 80 or older, likely reflecting the presence of other diseases, a weaker immune system, or simply worse overall health. By contrast, the fatality rate was 1.3% in 50-somethings, 0.4% in 40-somethings, and 0.2% in people 10 to 39.Another interesting statistical piece of information is the effect of a history of smoking on survivability of the disease. A significant number of infected patients develop Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome (ARDS) and half of the ARDS patients died, compared to 9% of patients who did not develop the syndrome. Smoking is linked to increased risk of ARDS and it is thought that the high rate of smoking in China is contributing to the mortality rates even among younger patients."
"Here's a summary of the 7 confirmed cases in Mexico...On 28 February, Mexico confirmed its first three cases. A 35-year-old man and a 59-year-old man in Mexico City and a 41-year-old man in the northern state of Sinaloa tested positive and were held in isolation at a hospital and a hotel, respectively. They both had travelled to Bergamo and stayed in Italy for a week in mid-February.On 29 February, a 4th case was detected and confirmed on the city of Torreon, in the state of Coahuila, from a 20-year-old woman who traveled to Italy.On 1 March, a 5th case was announced in Chiapas in a student who had just returned from Italy.On 6 March, a 6th case was confirmed in the State of Mexico in a 71 year old man who had returned from Italy the 21st of February.On 7 March, a 7th case was also confirmed in Mexico City in a 46 year old male who had previously had contact with another confirmed case in the United States.So far, none in the state of Quintana Roo.No deaths, and 4 of those cases have recovered."
"""I’m currently in Cancun (3/10/20) staying in an all inclusive resort.I believe there has been one confirmed case here now.""THERE ARE STILL NO CONFIRMED CASES IN CANCUN.Please don't state otherwise unless you have a reliable source you can cite. Hearing it from your bartender who heard it from the maid who heard it from her neighbors second cousin who heard it from someone else is not reliable.Everyone who makes this statement without being able to give a reliable source of info is doing nothing more than feeding into panic. We don't need that here. And you're doing a disservice to many people when you put out false info like this."
Thank you Joan. Almost said the same thing earlier but got sidetracked.
"Finishing last minute things and being reminded to see things through my 4 year olds eyes.. She has zero concern, doesn’t even what the heck coronavirus. She looked at me and said (in the sweetest voice) I’m SO excited mom.Thank you all for sharing you opinions and thoughts. You have made the decision to go a little bit easier! Can’t wait to get on the beach and enjoy a few drinks!"
Give me a break. Nothing in my post would invoke “panic”. I did use “I believe” in the one case I mentioned which came from a news source not a “bartender.. blah blah blah”. You must be some adolescent trying to keep your spring break plans.
"I want to give a shout out to Expedia's helpfulness in the situation, in case anyone else is in a similar boat. Though we are still undecided about our upcoming Cancun trip, we did decide to cancel our Park/Stay/Fly reservation we'd made at our airport for the night before our very early flight. We decided that the stress of disinfecting another hotel room and being among possibly stranded travelers from an international airport wasn't worth the 45 minutes of extra sleep it was going to afford us for our very early flight out. Though the hotel stay was fully non-refundable, Expedia had me stay on the line while they contacted the hotel and arranged the cancellation and refund. I was impressed with how quickly I got through and how willing they were to fix this. I would have been happy with a credit, but got a full refund without penalty.Edited: 2:46 pm, March 10, 2020 "
Expedia does tend to do that at times. I’ve had them do 3 times before. It’s pretty impressive
I'm curious but are there any corona virus testing places here cancun or playa del carmen?Is there any concern if someone here coughs into you and you feel some symptoms?
"""I'm curious but are there any corona virus testing places here cancun or playa del carmen?Is there any concern if someone here coughs into you and you feel some symptoms?""You mean like specific testing centers where you can just show up to get tested? No. If you feel ill for any reason, just go see a doctor. Wouldn't you do that at home? Common sense goes a long way.Don't leave home without it."
@RonnieAccording to studies.. by the time you start showing symptoms you’ll most likely be either at the end of your vacation or already home. Even in the states many professionals have said unless you greatly believe you have come in contact with the virus there’s no need to test just out of fear.
"Sorry Joan, but according to advice here if you are showing symptoms the last thing you should do is visit your doctor."
"Quick update. Colorado now has 15 confirmed patients of various ages. Colorado Governor declared a State of Emergency today for the state. This allows a drive thru testing area to be set up for testing people with symptoms to be tested without visiting a doctors office and exposing healthcare workers and office patient areas. Has anyone heard of this in Cancun? We have many many visitors from out of state and Europe coming for ski vacations. Being so much international travel here, the hope is to test travelers by making it as easy and pro active as possible."
But would anyone here be concerned if someone coughed and the cough went straight to your face? I was walking by and a person literally coughed right into my face.
"""But would anyone here be concerned if someone coughed and the cough went straight to your face? I was walking by and a person literally coughed right into my face.""Are you saying that the only reason you 're concerned that this happens is because of the Corona virus?Aren't you be concerned about catching the flu or the common cold if someone did this?What if there was no Corona virus? Then this behavior would be acceptable to you? It wouldn't bother you?Get real people. You're letting this virus color all your personal interactions with other people. This behavior was unacceptable before the Corona virus and will still be unacceptable after it. But lately it seems like you want to classify every social interaction in terms of the virus. If someone coughed in my face it would piss me off. Corona virus or not, it's unhealthy and unsanitary. My reaction would be the same even if the virus wasn't the story of the moment."
"You are assuring people that they ""should be fine"" if they wash their hands? who are you? Becuase that isN NOT what the WHO and CDC are saying and it's not all about ""you."" It's about other people too -anyone with Diabetes (A or B), heart disease, compromised immunity (which includes EVERYONE on prednisone or other steroids) , and the elderly (over 70). Do you not care about bringing the virus to others? (PS are you only watching Fox News?)"
"Hmmn, so you're a travel agent. I would say your opinion is probably biased."
"Do you understand that misleading people in this way has serious -possibly fatal -ramifications? You know nothing of the updated reports on the dangers of Coronavirus. If you are not going to bother to keep up with the CDC and WHO reports, do not presume to speak about this. You are neither a doctor nor a specialist in epidemiology. You sound like Trump."
That is not true. 7 reported but leading Specialist says probably much more. https:/…
"@reviewermarylandUnfortunately, I think if things get that bad (which in some areas they may) the same thing will happen within the states. A lot of rural communities or smaller states might not be able to take control of a major outbreak. Some of our much smaller local hospitals do not have an ICU, let alone inpatient beds (if you go in you’re transferred elsewhere).Some friends in the medical field have voiced concerns about those who may not have coronavirus that will need emergency care. Other emergency health events don’t stop during a time like this. It’s definitely concerning for older individuals!!"

"@ReviewerMaryland1. Thanks for the interesting translated article. Couple things caught my attention because they vaildate some of the stats and drivers I have read in WHO and CDC articles.""we carefully evaluate patients with serious cardio-respiratory diseases and people with serious coronary problems, because they tolerate acute hypoxia poorly and have little chance of surviving the critical phase.”“If someone between the ages of 80 and 95 years has serious respiratory failure, you likely don’t proceed. If he or she has multiple organ failure involving at least three vital organs, this means that they have a mortality rate of one hundred percent. By now, they’re gone.”This supports the theories about why Covid 19 mortality rates are high in China and Italy. China has high rates of smoking (potential for respiratory disease) and Italy has an ageing population/lower birth rates....the age factor.Another interesting tidbit in this article is that they will pull the plug on a patient that has a low chance of survival.. especially those over the age of 80. In the US, that will likely not happen. We will put a pacemaker in a 95 year old and a hip replacement in a 96 year old. The stats show that a very small percentage of the population consumes a vast majority of the hospital care dollars in this country. Not advocating one way or the other, just highlighting the differences in the two healtcare systems."
"Cancun: here we come! So many in this forum sound like middle-aged, over-protective helicopter moms. So far, it looks like the virus has greatest risk of fatality for smokers and the elderly... remember: the vast majority recover from this; it's not the HIV.Edited: 10:43 am, March 11, 2020 "

My trip isn’t until April 22 so I still have time to make a decision. Right now I am leaning towards going. My husband and I are in our 60’s and healthy- knock wood. My daughter and friends are giving me a hard time about it. Is it frightening absolutely- but I can’t live in a bubble. There is no right or wrong answer you just have to do what you want to do. This is just my opinion. Peace to all.
It's now over a month since this question. I'm scheduled to go through Cancun to Tulum at the end of March. Have there been any local reports of cases in Cancun or at any of the large resort chains like AMResorts?
"Kathy12004: You and I are singing from the same hymn book. I am a young 70 year old (people tell me I could pass for 55) and I have no underlying health conditions except arthritis (but most older people have osteoarthritis) yet my daughter wants me to cancel, while my son is saying ‘you’ll be fine’. I’m going from March 30 to April 13 at the Valentin Imperial Riviera Maya. I’m seeing my family doctor on Monday next week to get her advice. I am mostly concerned about my 4 hour flight (cannot get my hands on hand sanitizers) and I am concerned about the Cancun Airport. I have lots of Lysol wipes. The VIRM resort has said they do have hand sanitizers, so unless something changes in Cancun, I’m going. I have good insurance and can cancel up to 3 hours prior to departure on March 30th. I travel every winter and I am really looking forward to this trip. I have seasonal affective disorder and my doctors say it’s important for my mental health to get my (yearly 2 week vacation somewhere hot, sunny and nice). We are all our own ‘health care advocates’ and each of us has to decide what is best in our own circumstances. At my age, I look at life as a ‘crap shoot’ that is random (You end up at the wrong place at the wrong time) so I told my daughter - Mama is going for her 2 weeks in Paradise!!!"
"Tracy D,So far, NO CONFIRMED cases in the state of Quintana Roo.There have been only 8 confirmed cases in the entire country -- no deaths, and 4 of those cases have recovered. Most are linked to Italy."
"We canceled our trip to Isla this morning. We were supposed to leave tomorrow morning. I'm sad and I'm angry, but I'm not sure who I am angry at. We really only get one opportunity to do these trips each year and I have been counting down the minutes since October..A person in our office attended a conference last week in NOLA and someone there had it. We are not sure if our person came in contact with the person that has it, but she is now our of the office for 14 days. She was in the office Monday and Tuesday. We cancelled, because our toddler would have been staying with his grandparents. We were concerned that I could have caught it, spread it to my son, and then he would spread it to his grandparents (upper 60's). My son would be be fine if he got it, but we were concerned about my wife's parents. Another concern was if they got it, we would have to hurry home. Our backup caregivers (both in their late 50's/early 60's) wouldn't have been able to pick him up if he was exposed. It also doesn't help that one of those backups is a physician (oncologist), and he does rounds every day. Him getting it would be a big deal.Delta gave me a credit that I can use on another flight. Privilege Aluxes said that they wouldn't charge me anything (cancellation is technically 1 night if cancelled less than 7 days b4).We found out about this situation at midnight, 30 minutes after the first 2 cases were announced in Michigan. One is in our county, but we don't know where. The other is in the county where we both work and where my in-laws live. We went from packing to canceling in about an hour. I live for these trips, so I am going to reschedule for May or June. This sucks."
"@duckbilledThis is what I was SO afraid of last night when news broke about the cases in Michigan. Especially last I knew they didn’t list the cities, I kept thinking what if it was someone I came into contact with. It sucks you had to cancel! Hope you guys stay safe and healthy.For everyone else: We just landed and so far feeling pretty good. People on the plane were cleaning and sanitizing. No one really wearing a mask besides 2 people. We ran into someone before boarding that let out a sneeze without covering his mouth - I’m shocked my husband didn’t knock him out because it’s common sense to cover your face.Now time to enjoy!!!"
Did you purchase travel insurance
"Duckbilled, I can understand how difficult that decision was for you and your family. I credit you, however, for having the wisdom and determination to do the right thing. Heck, Isla isn't going anywhere, and the potential outcomes if you hadn't made that brave decision could have been catastrophic.Here's to you, my man."
"We all hate to miss a vacation. I had to scrub our trip to Italy, and then I rebooked to go to Costa Mujeres. Now I'm probably going to have to scrub that too. I work in healthcare, and I'll be needed here in US. But - do I want to risk getting sick in another country? What If my mom or kids get sick while I'm gone - can I get back in a hurry? What if they institute a quarantine for entry back into the US? It's not the right time for me to go."
"DuckBilled,So sorry you had to cancel. It sounds like you made a good decision. We may end up in the same boat soon. This is very hard...truly unchartered territory."
Did you end up going? We leave from Vancouver March 16th.
"Thanks all. I will say that if it was just me and my wife, we would have gone. I really don't think I came in close enough contact with the person, and she doesn't even know if she came in contact with the person that had it.The problem is it isn't just us. We had to think about all of the people we could be hurting."
"With our current plan to travel down to CUN Friday morning completely up in the air, I am very curious to hear feedback from any folks currently staying at Riviera Maya resorts."
"duckbilled, I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you and your whole family stay healthy. Isla will be waiting for you."
I miss when I first started planning my family trip and TA was just about tourists worried about getting seaweed and driving around tulum and not getting a ticket. Can we go back that please and let coronavirus not happen anywhere
"Maegan: Have a wonderful (and safe) vacation. Let us all know how things went, when you safely return."
"Thanks for link.According to this website, Mexico (whole country) has 8 cases, out of which 4 already recovered and no death so far although 1 person ""in critical condition"""
"We’re cancelling. We were 10 days out. After Trump’s announcement tonight about European flights, and his itching to close the southern border, we’re not chancing the headaches."
It is sad when one's ideology makes them incapable of making rational assessments/decisions.The southern border needs to be closed for many reasons but that has ZERO to do with air travel between the USA and Cancun.
"We are going this saturday.. I called the airlines and there is no other way they can cancel the flight. I hope everything will be fine. As of now, there is no travel advisory from Canada. Those who are in Cancun kindly give us update. Thank you"
"Reply to Post # 437...Elena,Only 8 confirmed cases in the entire country, and none in the state of Quintana Roo. Most of the cases are linked to Italy.Of those 8 cases...no deaths and 4 of them have recovered."
"“It is sad when one's ideology makes them incapable of making rational assessments/decisions.” I agree it’s not rational, but I didn’t vote for him.Some of his earliest remarks on Covid-19, a propos of nothing, had to do with closing the southern border because of it: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/am…It must be quite a life to be free of all work and familial concerns such that potential logistical nightmares would not affect you. I’m sure you have reason to dismiss Anthony Fauci’s report today, prior to the WHO declaring this a pandemic, that Covid19 is 10 times deadlier than flu at least. You are far more “rational” than the country’s leading virologist after all."

Reviewemaryland- so are we
Good to hear that everything is getting better in Mexico. I always check the news and like you said no case in Q.R.

""" I’m sure you have reason to dismiss Anthony Fauci’s report today, prior to the WHO declaring this a pandemic, that Covid19 is 10 times deadlier than flu at least.""It is a problem for elderly with medical issues. Most people are at low risk.This is a hysteria event driven by a corrupt media. Go into rigorous protection mode against hand to face transmittal of germs and it becomes a minor event, especially if rigorous protections are instituted for at risk elderly folks."
"@Vancouver Sundog. Can you update us regarding the airport procedure/monitoring in Cancun Airport.? Both arrival and departure"". Thanks"
"Hi Elena just to let you know me and my wife are going to cancun friday morning ,we are in long island new york we can not cancel either."

"Reviewer Maryland, so sorry you had to cancel your trip, but I think I would've done the same after hearing Trump's rather strange speech tonight.The randomness of closing the border to European travel but not the UK would have me concerned that Mexican travel would be next on the president's list, too."
Corrupt media???
12 cases confirmed in Mexico https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020…
"There is no screening at all at airports. For travelers from any destination ""To date, Mexico’s government has not issued official guidance.""- The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Foreign Relations"
"No, the problem is the Health Ministry is underfunded and inefficient. Mexico only has 3 medical facilities licensed for coronavirus testing in the entire country. Very very few people have been tested. And because tourism is a major part of the Mexican economy the President has not pressing for monitoring the virus. But today the Director of the WHO organization criticized countries that ""do not have the resolve"" to monitor or implement guidelines -without naming. He said"" they know who they are."" (Tip: Make sure you're looking at indpeendent press sources. Much of what you find online that looks like Mexican press are actually tourist industry publications."
"""David Clark, general manager of FreeWheel, an advertising company owned by Comcast, flew to Cancun - ""Kennedy International Airport in New York on Thursday morning after attending a meeting in Cancun, Mexico. Mr. Clark, a regular business traveler, said that his flight was almost empty, and that both airports seemed quiet. He said he might not fly again for months."""
"It is fine if you want to choose to be in denial but it is not a ""minor event. And it is not just the elderly. Fatality rate for people with diabetes who contracted the virus is around 9%. For people with heart disease, suppressed immunity the fatality rate is higher. Patients under treatment for cancer and other malignancies also are at elevated risk. While chemotherapy has the biggest immunosuppressive effects, radiation and surgery also can inhibit the body’s disease-fighting ability. Chemo or radiation both compromise your immunity. The disease is 10X more fatal than flu. There is no cure. In Italy the count tonigh tis 879 pple dead. . It is not a minor problem."
I12 now -
"MIT Professor: The short-term impacts are clear: many, many people are going to become ill and die. And slowing the outbreak and providing proper care needs to be our highest priority right now."
"""Passengers arrive at Mexico City airport. A doctor says greater efforts should be taken to test travelers"" https:/…"
12 confirmed as of yesterday. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020…
"This is the problem. There is no transparency. No independent publication of the situation. We have no idea what's going on For security reasons implemented at national level, suspicious cases are placed under observation inside hospitals without providing information in this regard until they are discarded or corroborated by the Ministry of Health."
Mexico has a Data Privacy Law and health conditions of individuals are considered sensitive information so they can be kept private. (If you go and suspect you are infected call the Ministry of Health’s COVID-19 information hotline at 800-0044-800.
"“It is a problem for elderly with medical issues. Most people are at low risk.This is a hysteria event driven by a corrupt media.”Oh...I forgot the part where Dr. Fauci said that 6 out of 10 Americans have underlying health issues that put them at higher risk. The WHO, CDC, and NIH consider this a major international public health issue that they are working to contain. Insisting otherwise, in spite of changing and mounting evidence, borders on delusional and is pathologically absent of empathy for those at risk in the community."
Hi Johnny. Thank you. Yes please update us if possible. Enjoy your vacation.
"This interview is very informative, and this expert points out that this is not just a issue for the elderly.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSwWhile he is in that age group, the fact that Tom Hanks has the virus should be telling us that this outbreak is wide-reaching. Also, the Utah Jazz player - very healthy and young.I think one of the issue that concerns me is the Mexican resorts are not known for providing good pay and benefits for their employees. I'm guessing that a lot of people will be forced to come into work even if they are sick (either by their employers or economic reasons).Edited: 8:07 am, March 12, 2020 "
No one is denying that younger healthy people can get sick.. but so far stats show that it’s not as severe for them. As far as Tom Hanks his kids even updated his condition and said he’s barely sick.
We have decided to postpone our vacation to the region. No sense in introducing more risk and the resorts will still be there when the dust settles. Safe travels.
"At this point any flights coming to Cancun from Italy are nothing but empty planes that are being used to get there people back m me.No incoming passengers coming from Italy to Cancun. There are 12 confirmed cases in Mexico at this point. Still, no confirmed cases here in Cancun. My boyfriend works for the city of Cancun. He is attending a meeting right now in his directors absence about the Corona Virus and what is is being done or what will be implemented between airport, city and hotel association official so hopefully we'll see some more screening and preventative measures than we have in the past few weeks."
"""We have decided to postpone our vacation to the region. No sense in introducing more risk and the resorts will still be there when the dust settles. Safe travels.""Very wise and unselfish decision. Most likely one you will not regret making."
"I'm also contemplating this. We booked the Grand at Moon Palace for mid April. As of earlier this week we were going ahead with plans. But as the situation evolves & seems like it is getting worse, I feel we should postpone the trip."
"I must try one more time to convey the real danger with Covid-19 transmission.- It has nothing to do with the number of identified cases in Mexico.- It has EVERYTHING to do with the crowds in the international airports, in the planes themselves (miniature cruise ships, breathing everyone elses' ailments, trusting that the airlines are actually disinfecting all the surfaces...), the crowds in baggage claim, the crowds in customs, .... crowds in general, from who knows where ...- Maybe you will contract a dose and hopefully recover beautifully ... but how many people will you transmit it to that may not be as robust as you, that WON'T recover as beautifully.....This Is Going To Get Worse. I'm not crying Wolf; I'm reflecting the views of the vast majority of non-political medical authorities.Reschedule your trip until this clears up.And, BTW, ""Pilots"" and ""Remys"" do no one any favors by propogating contrived political ignorance."
6 out of 10 have underlying health care conditions Honestly I must have incredibly healthy friends that skew the curve. I have one friend who had a kidney transplant so she’s always at high risk. That’s it. And I am counting a lot more then 10 people
Agree with you. I'm also worried about a situation where there is even 1 case at the resort & they shut it down/quarantine us in the room & money down the drain & all that headache around that.
We (Three families with 5 total kids between 5-10) are supposed to travel March 28-April 2nd to Cancun and stay in Playa Mujeres. We have until the 25th to cancel. We aren't worried (at the moment) about getting sick as much as we are concerned about getting home or quarantined when arriving back in the US. We have to close on two homes on the 3rd and move on the 4th so this is putting added pressure on our already busy week. We werent buying/selling/moving when we booked and obviously the global pandemic wasnt a thing. Thank you to everyone for posting informative information which allows to make the correct decisions.
@WorldTraveler & @Lafterhours agree with you. Worried more about being stuck there & quarantined if there is a case/outbreak at our resort.
"We aren't worried (at the moment) about getting sick as much as we are concerned about getting home or quarantined when arriving back in the USDo you have family members or loved ones who are over 65 and/or people you love with medical conditions like diabetes or hypertension or respiratory problems? Imo those of us who are in the 'young and healthy' category should really be concerned about spreading it rather than catching it, really. The virus shedding stage lasts from 20-37 days"
@Rissak Our whole crew are adults between 40-50 yrs old and the kids I mentioned. No one has any prexisting conditions/ diabetes etc.
"I meant what about people in your home community(ies) that you'll be presumably returning home to and coming into contact with and possibly infecting- even if none of you exhibit symptoms? It's not just about ourselves, is my point."
Update: I cancelled my trip with my family. I received a news from our Gov't here that if anyone travel outside Quebec will do a self-isolation for 14 days no matter which country we visited. I don't want to take a risk because first i wont be paid for my vacation plus the 2 weeks of self isolation. I will definitely visit Cancun on December hoping the virus disappeared.

"@Rissak Yes i was also concerned about potentially carrying something back & not being symptomatic & spreading to our parents who we see often. Knowing the facts now, I don't want to have to quarantine ourselves for ~30 days. It's not worth all the headache & various risks involved for a 1 week all inclusive which we can postpone to a later date."
"""Oh...I forgot the part where Dr. Fauci said that 6 out of 10 Americans have underlying health issues that put them at higher risk. ""That sounds like nonsense when other medical professional s say that most Americans are at low risk.It sounds like Fauci wants people to be able to go to Walmart or 7-11 and pick up test kits.39 people in the US have died from this. About 13 in one nursing home.Protect the vulnerable elderly and this is a minor problem."

"Well Mexico does have cases now, and even if it didn't you still need to get there and that means being in crowds and possible travelling through infected airports."
"co-pilot- it will turn out to be a 'minor problem' if the precautionary measures like cancelling unnecessary travel and urging better hygiene and social distancing etc are successful.Which are the things people are railing about, go figure.You know what will happen if this hopefully does turn out to be a very minor pandemic with few deaths and not a lot of negative economic impact? The same people whining about the precautions being urged today will say 'see, it turned out to be nothing!"" thinking they got one over on everyone being cautious- and not even realize the irony!"
There have been ZERO coronavirus cases in Cancun or Play Del Carmen. 2 people were tested who were suspected but they were negative.
"@Travelling_wildcat123 -Knowing what we know, I will rephrase your statement as thus: There have been ZERO CONFIRMED Corona virus cases in Cancun and Playa Del Carmen. This doesn't mean the virus is not present there!Let he who has ears to hear listen and apply wisdom! They can only test those that come forward with symptoms. It has been said that a significant proportion of the infected population have mild symptoms, including children that usually do not appear to have any symptoms but may be carriers. These folks will not be tested so my gut tells me the infected population is undercounted everywhere. Countries like South Korea are doing 10k tests a day, apparently random testing included. Mexico has only done about 300 as of today. The US and Europe are applying triage so that folks with mild or incomplete symptoms are screened out from testing. In my opinion, with evidence of what’s going on, you cannot assign a risk rating to an entire country or even sections of it. Risk ratings are now personal. If you follow the prescribed prevention measures, you are at a lower risk of getting the virus. If you don’t, you are at a higher risk regardless of if you are in Wuhan China or Cancun Mexico! This virus should be assumed to be here, there and everywhere and all should take the prescribed precautions. No one should assume that its entirely safe because there have been few to no confirmed cases."
Us 2! First week of March! If you don't have trip insurance you are pretty much screwed. If Trump bans travel before your departure date to and from Mexico you should receive a full refund.
I am to leave on the 17th - have you made your decision?
will you be going - we are to leave from Toronto on the 17th!
What did you end up doing? I’m in the same situation.
Any updates on this? Are there protocols put in place at the Cancun airport to screen for Coronavirus? We are supposed to leave tomorrow and I would like to know what to expect. Thanks!
"Folks, you ARE NOT screwed without trip insurance. The airlines are waiving change fees. We were offered a credit towards another trip.Call and see if there is anything they can do for you. Plan to be on hold for a long time."
"I am canceling my trip to Cancun on the 21st of March. I am a single parent with 2 kids, and I have no other adult to back me up should something happen. My province is saying not to go on non essential travel. Oh well, there is always next year. Stay safe all.Edited: 7:05 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"""And how do you propose people take care of the elderly when you dismiss the need for social distancing?""When did I do that? I practice that when someone shows signs of being sick. Taking care of the elderly should be a high priority. I don't know the appropriate protocols but going all in with protective measures is not too much."
Cancelled my trip to Playa del Carmen that was supposed to begin on the 14th. It was our only vacation of the year so we are pretty upset/angry but we can't risk the quarantine either in Mexico or at home in the US.
Just flew home from Cancun March 10th. No screenings. It was business as usual. Had a relaxing time at the Paradisus and there were many people there.
"Dean K: Well, I never thought I would be saying this, but today, I decided to cancel, my 2 week stay on March 30th at the Valentin Imperial Riviera Maya. It is breaking my heart, but I was going to travel ""solo"" and with all this ""social isolation"", no shaking hands, no hugs, no close contact with anyone, like my teller at the bank said today ""Are you Nuts, so you want to go and spend two weeks at a resort, and not come into close contact with people, more or less isolating yourself"" that's not what vacations are for. Also I spoke to my doctor today, and she is saying although I am in pretty good health, I should consider my husband who is 71 has a lot of allergies and some respiratory issues, and I would never forgive myself, if I came back from Cancun and somehow passed whatever I got onto him. So, I'm out. There is always next year, hopefully. My daughter is happy about my decision and so is my son who thinks things are only going to get worse here in Canada. It's too bad, as I have been looking forward to this holiday since June of last year. But I don't want to spend hours on a plane, and worse still, time spent in Cancun Airport with ""wall to wall"" travellers going through customs and security. So, Mexico will always be there, next year hopefully, when this pandemic has passed. My thoughts for all future travellers is this, ""you and only you have to weigh the costs of travelling or not"" at the end of the day, I've decided at my age and with the advice I've been given, that it's time to take a pass and not risk my heath or that of my family."
"Arlene, you are a very wise woman.Well done; the Maya Rivera isn't going anywhere."
"Arlene, so sorry to hear this! But I think you did the right thing as you inquired with your doctor first. I know you were very hopeful that it would go as planned for your vacation. The news is changing daily and I cannot even predict what will happen in the end of May for my travel/wedding. But I will try to stay optimistic right up till I get any news regarding any advisories for mexico. Fingers crossed and I hope everyone who is planning to travel that things will ease up in a couple of months.."
"“When did I do that? I practice that when someone shows signs of being sick.”Every time you dismissed concerns about airplanes and airports as irrational or hysterical, you dismissed the need for social distancing, which is what every public health expert is saying is the best way to contain the virus. Distancing yourself only when you are aware someone is sick runs counter to what you hear a thousand times a day about the virus—that people are contagious for up to 2 weeks before they’re symptomatic. You have shown regard for no one (except yourself and your personal agenda) in your recommendations and certainly not those at high risk like the elderly. Thank God no one of importance is recommending your approach."
"We were scheduled to leave March 22 (two adults + teen daughter) staying at Sunrise Moon Palace in Cancun. We DID pay the refundable rate and Southwest which means every cent will be refunded IF we cancel.We are leaning toward canceling our trip based on developments over the past 24 hours (Trump travel ban and significant state /local restrictions being introduced) . Schools around us are closing for 2+ weeks. Disney is closing, etc. My biggest personal concern is the air travel, airports, customs/immigration, etc. Also, we've been to the Moon Palace a couple of times and there are always loads of brits and other international travelers. I know there have been no reports of cases in Cancun but that's not the issue. It's the risk (perceived or real) that increases within high traffic and close proximity areas as mentioned above.Even though my family is low risk (age and good health), I'm concerned about impacting others around me (older family members, children, etc.) when we get back. Yes, I understand the 12 day isolation thing, but let's get real - that's tough when you have responsibilities (work, life). Just my two cents.Also, I do not want to be worried about the guy next to me sneezing at the buffet breakfast or the wonderful pool servers not washing their hands. These thoughts/concerns WILL affect our enjoyment; there is simply no escaping the cluster f&%k that is happening globally.Hope this helps others contemplating their trip."
"What are the odds of being on a plane with an infected person now? Very low.Are you recommending that everyone avoid standing in a checkout line?Why not just quarantine the entire country for a month or two until the virus dies out.As for this statement below of yours you are either not seeing my multiple posts on it or your agenda has made you blind to those comments.""You have shown regard for no one (except yourself and your personal agenda) in your recommendations and certainly not those at high risk like the elderly."""
Companies are updating their policies daily. So check on their website every day to check if they have flexibility for changing or crediting your trip.
The news here is reporting there are now 16 cases of the virus in Mexico and 82 suspected cases. The government officials are saying that Mexico will not close their borders for incoming flights or for land entries.
"The 26th we leave for Cozumel. We weighed the options and discussed the situation, while shopping at Target (lol, get it?) Our friend lives and works there and we speak almost daily. I am using the ocean to disinfect the fear that has been distilled in me. I live in Colorado and the winter to spring sever cold is bad every year. If you don't end up with walking pneumonia within a 5 year span at least once, then somethings wrong. Now for your fear, the virus does not flourish there, as it does here. The people you read about, are people who had it and travelled back to see there family. Again, it is not spreading. Signed, my friend from Mexico."
"A lot of people say don't go, while they are walking around Walmart, grocery stores, going out to eat, even if it's just lunch and what have ya. But when it comes time for a vacation, they are quick to say, you shouldn't go, you should cancel. Would you like to be stuck in your state and deal with all the fear factors of this virus. You are a hypocrite, if you are speaking of what to do, unless you are at home, locked into your home for at least 1 month. That means no in, no out. See how that works. I am young and under 50. I asked my friend who lives there, should I reconsider. He said, do you know the saying ""a trip to die for"", well this is it and we are not afraid of a virus that has been known not to thrive in warm tropical weather. Do you know there are parts of Mexico that it snows and have cooler winters? Then the rest of Mexico is set in tropical weather that stays consistant year round. Now, do you know where the very few cases of Corona has showed up? Take a huge guess. It pays to stay informed. At this time, we are sticking to plans, unless they cancel and so far they said they won't and please come."
"We cancelled our trip to Playa Del Carmen starting on the 14th, the main concern is that its unknown how much the virus has spread within the US and all the tourists touching utensils and sneezing on the buffets is a risk. I'm close to 60 so its not worth it and will be less enjoyably in the current climate."
"Some very brave decisions are being made by the sound of things. Perhaps now is the Time for us all to look after loved ones and especially those who are at high risk now. The Riviera Maya will still be waiting for us all when this Virus has gone.Stay safe everyone.Edited: 3:50 am, March 13, 2020 "

COPilot's response should tell you all you need to know about him.
"""COPilot's response should tell you all you need to know about him.""Correct. I am not a doomer who falls prey to a politicized media driven hysteria event."
Dr. Fauci’s credentials: https:/…Anthony_S._FauciCo-pilot’s credentials:
"WorldTraveler,So true. And you know that if public health initiatives he calls hysteria help contain the virus and minimize deaths he will consider himself to have been correct. Beyond moronic."
"“Correct. I am not a doomer who falls prey to a politicized media driven hysteria event.“One need not face this with dread and doom to accept what every expert is describing as a massive public health concern. Behaving in a socially responsible way by following public health guidelines regarding social distancing based on the emerging evidence about Covid-19 simply makes you smart and a good citizen of the world who wants to mitigate the damage. Saying chances of contracting it in-flight are low without any evidence when this virus spreads exponentially, many are asymptomatic, many are pre-symptomatic, testing is inadequately available, and test results take a week or more is beyond ignorant."
"I am not in favor of panic or hysteria and I am lucky enough that I do not have a pending trip....ours is scheduled for September. I am in favor of some social distancing. I work a job that puts me in contact with the general public everyday and we are taking sanitizing seriously at the direction of our employer. I happen to live in a city with a premier Bio containment unit and sick folks are being shipped here. One of our largest employers with the largest campus now has a positive Covid case and have shut down. Co Pilot, it is VERY possible that you are giving bad and irresponsible advice. Each traveler will have to decide for themselves if they travel....Just my opinion....stay safe everyone and for goodness sake, wash your hands!"
"#516 is the best ""mic drop"" of a post I have ever seen on TripAdvisor."
"To Defhero. I live in your state of Colorado and posted more than a week ago about why I chose to cancel my week long trip to PDC in the last week. I believe you have a condescending tone to your post. You need not lecture to anyone why be a hypocrite if not going on vacation but to Walmart. As you know in our state, we are in a full blown State of Emergency mode with even drive up testing site for the Virus. It’s a little different being here in the States where you have first class medical care, first class doctors and hospitals and 24 hour pharmacies at your convenience. Sooooo, if you do get sick, you have that assurance....where as in Mexico right now, very little healthcare for even their residents....that is the difference."
