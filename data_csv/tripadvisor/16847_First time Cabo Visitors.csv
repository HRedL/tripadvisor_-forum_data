I've been reading through old forums and had some questions about my upcoming trip to Cabo in November.We are a couple in our late 20s staying at the Welk resort for a week - 1) Does it make sense to rent a car? 2) I personally want to catch a marlin and do some deep sea fishing - any tips? I hear Redrum is a good place to book through....do I need to make a rez in advance?3) Where's the best place to snorkel/dive?4) Any good challenging hikes?Thanks TA!
"1) I think so, if you're planning all these excursions. I think a taxi is about $15US / 150-200 peso each way (between Welk & Cabo.)2) Definitely make reservations. November is excellent fishing.3) Several options. TA member caboticket is a DiveMaster with a great reputation.
