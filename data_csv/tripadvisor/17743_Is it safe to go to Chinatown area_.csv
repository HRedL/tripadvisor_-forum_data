"I am in Vancouver now and the reason I ask this is because there are a lot of drug addicts around Chinatown area in Vancouver and it deterred us from going anywhere nearby. One of our friends said NYC would be the same, so I thought I would ask here to confirm before I fly to NYC tomorrow. Thanks."
I've never seen a junkie in NY's Chinatown.
The problem in Chinatown is all the counterfeit merchants on the street. Do visit the Museum of the Chinese in America.
"I live inVancouver and the junkies you refer to are outside Chinatown. While there may be one or two around, that doesn’t stop most people from going to the area. A couple of the trendiest restaurants in the city are there and if the area is that dangerous they wouldn’t have the clientele to support it. Vancouver Chinatown is in the process of gentrification. No reason to avoid it. No reason to avoid NewYork’s which is even a more vibrant place . I don’t think your friend knows what he/she is talking about. Go!"
"+1 for WEQueen's response. Honestly, though, I'm not sure how one spots junkies. All I know for sure is that no one has ever bothered me.(You WILL smell weed all over the city, so be prepared for that.)"
We walked from gas town towards china town and there Were lots of them in groups. Maybe entering from the other side would be better? Not sure but I didn’t feel safe at all so we walked back.
They were literally using needles and sniffing heroine right in front of me and it’s quite confronting!
Chinatown is not synonymous with drug addicts
"You passed through ""Pidgin Park"" just skirt it That's far from Chinatown. (FWIW: There's a restaurant right in front of that area called Pidgin, which is/was very popular, so most people are unfazed with that activity, although a visitor might be). Just skirt around it. They don't care about you except maybe for a penny or twoI don't avoid Gastown town because of that small corner. Lots of great shopping and very good dining around the area. Besides Chinatown is a bit further off than that.As they say: Local Colour! That's part of the ""ambiance"".Just go to Chinatown New York. Just don't buy fake TAT on Canal Street.Edited: 1 year ago "
It's more like Toronto's Chinatown; no to be more accurate it's more like San Francisco's Chinatown; neither is dangerous; neither is the one in NYC.
"Chinatown is perfectly safe in NYC, just like the rest of the city."
Some cities have places where street people with drug addictions congregate. Just because it was near Chinatown in one city does not mean that every Chinatown in every city is a magnate for this type of activity. Chinatown in Manhattan does not have that going on. I've had more problems near Times Square than I have had in and near Chinatown.
"Homeless people can be anywhere, and substance abuse is synonymous with them. If you worry about this, you're going to drive yourself crazy. Go to Chinatown and enjoy yourself."
"Go and enjoy Chinatown. But please don't purchase the counterfeit goods. The proceeds fund terrorism, human trafficking, and other nefarious activities."
I found a reference to an old NY Times article from 1883 about the closing of the Chinese opium dens in the city. It looks like Chinatown is drug free.
Simple answer: Chinatown is safe.
"***Honestly, though, I'm not sure how one spots junkies. All I know for sure is that no one has ever bothered me.***Track marks, pupils, paraphernalia, behavior, etc."
"Aaargh - please everyone stop using the term “junkies”. This is so unacceptable as to be unbelievable that normal people still say it.People with addictions don’t ever set out to be alcoholics or dependent on drugs. Anyone who thinks this is a lifestyle choice is sadly deluded and needs education.People with any addiction, whether it be alcohol, drugs, gambling, whatever need help, not judgement or name-calling."
"Junkies are a term used for people that abuse drugs, typically heroin. Yes, they are drug addicts, but that term junkie has been around for very long time. I've been hearing it for all of my life, so for me, I don't think it's unacceptable. There are a lot of other things that are unacceptable, but this is a travel forum, so I'll stop there."
"Yes, and a travel forum can be used to enlighten people as to what’s acceptable. In the UK, that word is still used but as an EXTREMELY derogatory term used by people who look down on those with addictions. Or by very ignorant people who don’t know any better.As I said, addiction is not a choice, despite what people may think. I suggest people use a more sympathetic term.As an addition, I would lose my job if I were to describe a drug addict as a ‘junkie’. That’s how horrible the term is here.Edited: 1 year ago "
""" One of our friends said NYC would be the same, "" sounds like your friend has NEVER been to NYC. Chinatown and most of Manhattan is extremely safe. The bad parts of NYC most tourists have no reason to be in in the first place."
"""People with any addiction, whether it be alcohol, drugs, gambling, whatever need help, not judgement or name-calling."" There are numerous ways to get help in NYC and even post-arrest there are specialized diversion courts for drug treatment etc. The reality is that many addicts rather get high and commit crime to support their habit than get clean. That is the cold hard truth, so please don't assume you understand the addiction issues and how they are addressed in NYC."
"***The reality is that many addicts rather get high and commit crime to support their habit than get clean. That is the cold hard truth, so please don't assume you understand the addiction issues and how they are addressed in NYC.***This is the truth. There is so much help and opportunity out there, but addicts fall back into the trap of addiction. I've seen it far too many times and know plenty of people that are gone today because of heroin."
"Red, and springerandy, how do you know that 888iloveholidays isn't an addictions counselor? I don't think a call for a more humane use of wording is out of line. Do you, really?888ilove also didn't say anything about how addiction is addressed here. The fact that red said ""The reality is that many addicts rather get high and commit crime ... than get clean"" tells me your knowledge of it is very limited. (I was a certified social worker and have experience in this field.)I don't think what 888ilove is saying is inappropriate at all.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Well, yeah, you just described the nature of addiction. I don't think the nature of the disease is different in NYC than in the UK.881iloveholidays, you're absolutely right - I used the term because the OP had, somewhat ironically because it sounded strange to me. If I had thought for a moment I would have realized that irony was totally out of place here."
"Dictionary.Com shows the word junkie as a drug addict, especially as one addicted to heroin. https://www.dictionary.com/browse/junkieSure, if one is a social worker, they would use drug addict. But I still don't see anything wrong with the word junkie, it's in the dictionary. I know someone who has a graduate degree from Columbia and many years of experience working with drug addicts. Success rates are very low and red's statement is fair and accurate."
"Yup, success rates are very low for a reason. It speaks to the intensity of the power of that substance one is addicted to. That's why it's an addiction and not just a Saturday night ""fling"" with a drug. To make a sweeping statement such as those afflicted would RATHER commit crime than get clean is just ignorant and perpetuates the prejudice against and stigmatization of addicts."
"***To make a sweeping statement such as those afflicted would RATHER commit crime than get clean is just ignorant and perpetuates the prejudice against and stigmatization of addicts.***I'm not disagreeing with your statement Lizzie, however the numbers speak for themselves. There are so many resources for people, the disease does take over and for so many, it wins. It's a harsh reality that many people don't understand. The people that become addicted don't realize what they're getting themselves into and once they're addicted, it's too late, more times than not. I know far more people that lost their battle to addiction than those that are clean and sober. The numbers are not in your favor if you decide to stick a needle in your arm."
"The numbers confirm how difficult it is to get clean, and stay clean, Andy. It means we need more research and better solutions and treatments so that those ""left behind"" can get there.I'll use myself as an example. I was addicted to cigarettes for over 20 years. I tried everything that was out there. Cold turkey, 3x. Went to American Lung Assoc. program twice. American Cancer Society twice. Gum. Patch 2x. I even went to Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for counseling. What worked after all of that was a miracle drug called ""Chantix"" that came out in 2006. It curbed and near-eliminated the craving, almost 100%. I've been off nicotine for over 10 years now, and never once looked back.If similar interventions could be found for other addictive substances, our society would lose a lot of ""criminals."" We're just not there yet."
"We all have different thoughts and beliefs. I too was a heavy cigarette smoker for a bit over a decade. I quit cold turkey and never looked back. That worked for me, I'm glad you found a way to stop. In my opinion, we need to do a better job with education from an early age. We need to send clear messages to kids that drugs more times than not will kill you or ruin your life, especially heroin. There is a case in NJ where a young man killed three innocent people while driving high on heroin. Rather than taking responsibility, his lawyer is using a defense strategy that there was fentanyl in the heroin and the driver didn't know about it. What a cop out, the guy was still driving on heroin and killed three innocent people. Needle programs and facilities to shoot heroin send the wrong message. We should be stopping the flow of illegal drugs. Criminalizing those hasn't worked, but neither has decriminalization. Yes, it is a complex problem. I have a hard time with using more drugs to get people off of drugs. It's a downward spiral and the only one making out in the end is big pharma, but that's a whole different story."
"If there are no drug addicts in a big city, is it a big city? They’re in every city. I haven’t seen any. I’m more concerned about the counterfeiters with their suitcases of wares."
"Addicts - drugs, alcohol, gambling or whatever, usually have concomitant mental health issues and if both are not addressed in depth (which is very rare - usually treatment is short term programs with very limited resources and limited or no follow up) and this means the chances of recovery are very small. I'm not talking about drug dealers - which is a whole different thing - but the resources available to addicts is woefully inadequate - it's no wonder they usually fail."
"Drugs in the US are not just a big city problem, they're everywhere, especially heroin."
"""Dictionary.Com shows the word j****e as a drug addict, especially as one addicted to heroin.""The dictionary also has the words s**t, F**k, and a lot of other words you can't use on this site. Can we agree to make an effort to move away from words that tend to offend or that are value laden? It's not that hard.Hello world, hot off the presses: NYC and the rest of America has a problem providing sufficient mental health services. And Chinatown is safe. """
"Comments 23 and 24 are actually making me gasp with astonishment. Do you ACTUALLY believe that people choose a life of sadness, desperation, guilt, pain and poverty rather than the opposite? They also often lose custody of their children to Social Services. If you do, then I worry for YOUR mental health. These people have always got a back story, usually of abuse, violence or trauma of some sort. Nobody ever chooses a life of addiction and people involved with drugs are always looking for an escape from something. There is help in the form of support services but we are talking ADDICTION and many, many more people fail in their attempts to get clean, than get clean and drug-free. How on earth can those who judge not see that heroin and other drugs are hideously addictive and not easy to become free of? In the west of Scotland, heroin is £5 a bag ($6.50) so it is ridiculously cheap and nasty with the result that we have a very high rate of death by heroin overdose. It still isn’t enough to get people off it. If it was easy, success rates would be much higher. I can’t stress enough that these people need help, not shaming. I feel so sad for them. I myself have never been addicted to any substance (in case anyone thinks I protest too much) but my job involves regular contact with addicts. I’ve been into their lives and homes and it is just sad.Thank you Lizzie and Linda. To some of the others, step back and have a think about how lucky you are not to have such issues."
"Sorry Risa, I don't see how that word is offensive. Addicts are engaging in illegal and self destructive behavior, but some are worried about a term used to describe that behavior, which has been around for decades, hmmm."
Oh FFS springerandy - read my last post and PLEASE have another think.
"There's a lot of words we don't use anymore.If someone asks not to use a word, there's really no harm in respecting the request. What's the harm in being the most respectful to the widest audience?And if you have come in close contact with serious, clinically ill addicts, it's terribly sad to see that they often can't help themselves. I don't understand it any more than you do, but I have unfortunately witnessed it. I accept at face value that it is something we need to understand better."
"Drug addicts don’t all come from a life of abuse, trauma or violence. These days it’s a recreational activity with the young people. You only need to look at the ice epidemic to see not everyone comes from a traumatic background."
"***Do you ACTUALLY believe that people choose a life of sadness, desperation, guilt, pain and poverty rather than the opposite? They also often lose custody of their children to Social Services. If you do, then I worry for YOUR mental health.***Sorry you disagree, but the comments in #23 and mine in #24 are what they are. Everyone has a different view point, different experiences, etc. I respect your opinion and comments, I hope you can understand where I'm coming from with my comments, opinions, etc. Some of what you're saying is entirely true and I do believe that nobody wants to be an addict. The problem comes after someone is an addict and the effect that the drugs have had on them. It's so hard to reverse the damage done, hence why the success rates for recovery are so low. It's an epidemic and a complex problem we can all agree on that. Don't worry about my mental health, I'm quite fine and comfortable in my own skin."
"***If someone asks not to use a word, there's really no harm in respecting the request. What's the harm in being the most respectful to the widest audience?***Because I don't find the word harmful, if someone does, that's on them. We're big boys and girls, turn off the station if you don't want to listen."
"Honestly there’s too much PC. What not to eat and where. What not to say and where. What not to wear and where. Lighten up. Everyone knows what everyone’s talking about, they’re just using words that come naturally to them.Edited: 1 year ago "
Aynat - not describing people as ‘junkies’ isn’t about being PC. It’s about respecting people who have serious issues and are in dire need of support. It’s not just about being careful with the wording of things - it’s about affording people the same courtesy as anyone without their issues.
"@36 Please stop with the attacks. I have approximately two decades of experience dealing with these issues in NYC and interact with addicts on almost a daily basis so my comments are based on personal observations. I am well versed in the treatments available to people in NYC and the surrounding issues of drug addiction, mental health and criminal justice. Feel free to keep your opinions about the mental health of other posters to yourself. This is a travel forum and we have gone way off track here."
"I ask myself a question: - If a group states that a word is offensive to them do you still continue to use it? My personal answer: - For me to disregard offensiveness is telling that group ""your feelings are irrelevant, you do not have the right to those feelings and /or you should not feel that way"". There are many personal scenarios in which this is unacceptable.From my limited knowledge on the off topic: - Drug addiction has also been proven to be 50% hereditary. Children of addicts are 8 times more likely to become addicts themselves. Blaming someone when they inherited the ""disease""; I cannot come to terms with.P.S - Chinatown is fine.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Ter, you're a good man. Nice job."
"red259 - oh please, get real. There were no attacks in my post - merely a suggestion that those with no sympathy, empathy or understanding of the issues of others, just might have issues of their own. Plain and simple. If you choose to read more into it, then.........what can I say??"
So anyway .... Chinatown is fine I have stayed in one of the hotels there and have been there morning afternoon)bustling working community and at night when the area is much quieter.In any new city some tourists who are unsure of any area may not feel as comfortable or confident wandering late at night when the area has emptied out.https:/…must-see-chinatown-slideshowhttps:/…
"Vancouver is ** not ** NYC. Each country has it's +/-. A little research would have helped answer this question, given the 5-6 pages of TA replies posted thus far. Always, always better to research and learn a few details before posting on TA for any city. All of us respond based on our experience, so you have to take that for what it's worth (in any city).Give NYC Chinatown a shot and let everyone know yay/nay per your trip report, please!Edited: 1 year ago "
"@ 51 “ A little research would have helped answer this question”TA travel forum is research for many. There are no wrong questions. Ask away, You will get many different opinions however.BTW Im from Seattle, having gone to Vancouver BC many times over many years ,seeing many change. Everyone reacts differently when seeing what they think are drug addicts or folks down on their luck.  To me, it Sounds like your “friend” is making the incorrect assumptions about Manhattan Chinatown. You need to see it for yourself and make your own decisions. That is my advice. I like it there, its bustling with life and many good restaurants and interesting people, Everyone minds their own business. I agree its much quieter at night. Never seen anyone who looked like they were super high or needles strewn on street .Its OK to ask any question , otherwise how will you know?"
"Again, give NYC Chinatown a try and visit nearby neighborhoods, as well., You'll be glad you did, promise!"
"""One of our friends said NYC would be the same""On what basis did your friend state this? Have they ever been to the Chinatown in NYC? What else did they warn you off in NYC?"
