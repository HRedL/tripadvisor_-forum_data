"Wondering if any condos are being reasonable about cancellations these days, say applying deposit to future trips. We have a trip coming up in a month, inside the cancellation window so they say we would lose deposit unless they rebook the room, unlikely since nobody is going anywhere! Given many companiwa are banning employee travel and some states are enacting self quarantine for any international travel, I highly doubt I'll be able to go. For now I won't mention the name."
I have a condo booked next month. There is no chance I will cancel unless 1. I get Coronavirus and am quarantined.2. Cayman decides not to let visitors into the island.
Did you get vacation rental cancelation insurance? That should cover it.
No. I have travel insurance through my credit card but so far it doesn't seem like credit cards are covering this.

"<< ""For now I won't mention the name."" >>Nor should you, even if they don't refund/credit your deposit. Failure to acquire insurance protection in this instance is on the traveler... not the condo owner.If they do come through, and you want to praise them... go ahead. But there's no reason to ""shame"" them in the event they don't."
I don’t see how adhering to a cancellation policy is unreasonable. They could have given the space to someone else so why should they lose the money? Guests have the option of getting insurance that will cover such contingencies. Hopefully your place of employment will not be unreasonable and restrict your travel. Otherwise perhaps they should cover out of pocket expenses.
"Given the unprecedented global circumstances and the risk of quarantine in my opinion it’s not unreasonable to hope condos would be flexible in their policies. Especially if you are inquiring to delay a reservation and not cancel. To be quite frank, it is a matter of time before the virus spreads quickly in the Caribbean. I’m sure Cayman residents and it’s visitors are anxious, both for hosting tourists from affected countries and for tourists to get on a plane during such uncertainty. Limiting global movement and putting health before profit is not unreasonable."
"<< “it’s not unreasonable to hope condos would be flexible in their policies.” >>No, it’s not unreasonable to “hope” for this.It is, however, unreasonable to be really ticked-off if you don’t get it.Keep in mind that the condo is owned by a person who is also being negatively impacted by the current situation. It’s not unreasonable for that person to hope someone who booked the condo would understand the commitment they made when booking the condo."
"Yes, that is my point. United is allowing all tickets to be changed without change fees. People are, in general, being discouraged by governments, health departments, etc, from travelling. Many companies are asking employees not to travel. The condo in question was fully booked when I booked many months ago (got the last room) and now there are multiple rooms available, so the argument that they could have rented to someone else holds no water. This is an unprecedented situation. Allowing guests to apply their deposit to a future trip (even perhaps with a bit of penalty) does not seem like a crazy thing to hope for."
"<< “The condo in question was fully booked when I booked many months ago (got the last room)” >>Actually, you’re making the point that they COULD have rented the condo to someone else. Once you booked the last room... they stopped taking reservations. If not for your reservation, the next person to come along and reserve might not consider cancelling. The fact that other reservations — besides yours — may have been cancelled in the interim is immaterial.Edited: 8:32 am, March 10, 2020 "
Once again that is why you should have trip insurance that covers the contingencies. If you did there would be no problem!!! The responsibility for the “possible” change in plans is not on the condos owners end. I booked with third party for a hotel in Florida for the day after Hurricane Sandy hit NYC. There were actually a group of us so there were lots of deposits on the table. The airports were closed. We did not receive anything back from the vendor. It is what it is.
"Trip insurance is, by definition, a losing bet. If I lose my deposit on this trip because I can't go, such is life. In my last 15 years of travelling this would be the first trip I cancelled with a loss, at those odds paying 5%-10% for cancel-any-reason insurance would have been a huge losing bet! (It's obviously a different story for a save-for-years-once-in-a-lifetime type of trip.)Edited: 9:49 am, March 10, 2020 "
"<< Trip insurance is, by definition, a losing bet."" >>While I agree wholeheartedly with this sentiment -- and have never and will never buy travel insurance -- you can't have it both ways in your current situation.You knowingly played the odds. And, by your own admission you're still ahead of the game over time.If you get your deposit back, that's a bonus. If you don't, it's simply a cost of doing business that you willingly accepted."
"Yes, I totally agree! Stuff happens. They are well within their rights to do nothing for me. Obviously many in the hospitality industry are taking a different stance. I can change my flights without penalty, for example. I am merely wondering if any other condos are following the airlines' lead. If they are, perhaps I will rebook for that condo if I end up changing my flights."
"We have purchased trip insurance just a couple of times over the many decades of travel due to potential serious issues with family members. For condo rentals on GC, depending upon the season, payment in full often has to be made at least 60 days in advance of arrival and with cancellation in less than that window the deposit is forfeited but my understanding is the balance is refunded. The process might take a bit of time, it is not like you would be out the entire amount.  A few years ago we were faced needing to cancel a stay at a SMB condo just a week prior to arrival due to the most unexpected, sudden death of an immediate family member. The condo manager was absolutely topnotch in helping us with, if necessary, rebooking for a later date. While this might not happen during the current issue affecting so many people at the same time, I do think booking directly rather than via a third party is always the best option."
"<< “ wondering if any other condos are following the airlines' lead.‘ >>You keep talking about what “condos” would/should/might do. There is no monolithic “condos” business here. Consider that you’re talking about an individual person who owns the specific condo you’ve rented.Not sure why anyone would expect a private individual (who may already be struggling to cover the monthly nut on an investment property in the Cayman Islands) to “follow the lead” of a multi-billion dollar publicly traded company.Edited: 12:51 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"Condo owner here: Our policy has always been that someone can reschedule (with a 10% administration fee) at pretty much any time. But at late stages we will not be giving refunds.That is exactly what trip insurance is for.As a traveller, once in a while I will get it - often during hurricane season or when there is likely to be bad weather in the north east. I have had to use it once (due to bad weather in the North East causing me to miss my flight and me having to overnight in Boston). Just that one instance paid for all the times I have bought it.Owners are going to take a massive hit on this one, to the point where a lot of them are going to go out of business. They run to very tight margins, and assume a continuity of business. The wiser ones have some sort of loss of business insurance, but many consider it, as they say, ""a losing bet""."
"Interesting discussion, thanks. I feel for the owners, of course, though I was under the impression that many were individuals who use the condos sometimes and rent it out others, so a loss of rental income might mean they don't break even (or make money) on their vacation house this year rather than somehow ""going out of business."" I dunno I'd assume if you have the money to pay the massive taxes and downpayment to buy a condo you have a year of carrying costs in reserve at all times! Maybe a bad assumption.As for ""the condo,"" there is a still a management company that deals with the rentals and (I assume?) takes a cut of the rental fees. (I am talking about one of the major rental condos where you book through the condo)."
"You are right, there are some owners who have masses of money socked away for this sort of contingency, but by far not all. But even if they do, the idea of having an investment making a loss for a period of several months may well make a good investor decide against keeping it and look for ways to divest.The taxes to buy a condo aren't ""massive"" - 7.5% of the cost of the property without furnishings - and then there are no taxes to pay after that. Of course, if it's on a condo complex there are condo fees that need to be paid, along with the very high utilities bills. A lot of people I know who bought condos bought them as an investment for the future, rather than a place to live (not everyone of course) - if they are losing money on it, that is not going to be sustainable for any length of time.But to use your logic, vacationers are spending discretionary income on a trip - it's not like they need that money to live, presumably. So at worst they are going to be out a nice trip in these crazy times. Presumably they can handle it.That is NOT what I am advocating, mind you - this is all hard-earned money on both the vacationer and the owner and it should be valued as such.Most condos have a management company that takes care of it for a fee, yes. There are different pricing models for this (some work on a % of income, others on an hourly basis). The only exception to that may be where the owners live on-island."
"This is no different than any weather related incident...like a hurricane. It was completely out of nowhere & unpredictable. Purchasing trip insurance could have likely helped un this situation. Also, renting a private condo is not the same as a reservation from a chain hotel. You had a contract and knew the cancellation policy. Nobody said you have to cancel....Good luck!"
"Some owners never have their units in the rental pool, some do just for certain weeks of the year, in my understanding very few have been purchased solely for income as rental units. Obviously there are onsite managers who, along with making reservations from rental income, handle the provided ongoing services, upkeep, and security. The individual owners deserve protection when cancellations happen for any reason; the renters have the option of purchasing insurance should their plans change for any reason."
"The only protection they can have is to get insurance for loss of business. It's not cheap, but it does protect the owner in circumstances like this."
"I have never purchased trip insurance in the past but in light of the coronavirus, i looked into it for my upcoming trip. I was told that even with “cancel for any reason” insurance, it may not be covered. The insurance company said that most plans have in their fine print an exemption for illness due to an epidemic. I dont know if this is true for all companies since i only contacted one and i was probably going to just roll the dice anyways but it might be something people should ask about when buying trip insurance ."
"Wow, that's good to know! Thanks for sharing - people should pay attention to that for sure."
"I got an email from my insurance a few weeks ago and it basically said Concerns about CoronavirusThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly evolving situation. InsureMyTrip is working to provide updated information and guidance for travelers as it becomes available.Can I still purchase travel insurance?On January 21, 2020 the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) became a named event, which affects the travel insurance coverage available for new policies purchased. Purchasing after this date will limit trip cancelation benefits, but provide the following coverage:Emergency Medical CoverageEmergency Medical Evacuation CoverageTrip InterruptionCancel for Any ReasonStill not sure what that means! But I plan on going. Unless of course I cannot or I get Coronavirus before that."
I booked a condo for July through Airbnb. I received a very lengthy message yesterday through airbnb and another directly from the owner regarding cancellation due to corno virus. Basically they said 2 people on the island diagnosed and one in Jamaica and I could cancel my trip to GC without any penalties. The messages made me feel like the owner wanted me to cancel. The whole thing was kinda strange considering my trip is in July. Not sure what they are thinking but unless I can’t physically get there due to some kind of government imposed travel restrictions I am coming!!!!!
Well whatever the reason the information given is not correct at the current time. Not saying it wont change but as of right now — no!
"Samples Sent for Testing The Public Health Department is sending five samples to the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) to be tested for the coronavirus, (COVID-19) for a number of people who are feeling unwell and have recently travelled to countries who are experiencing an outbreak.  They remain isolated at home, except for one visitor who is an inpatient at Health City Cayman Islands.The citizens are being monitored by Public Health officials.  The inpatient at Health City Cayman Islands is a visitor who was admitted for a cardiac-event, but has subsequently developed respiratory symptoms typical with cardiac recovery however out of an abundance of caution is being isolated as a result.Sample tests will be sent to CARPHA today (Monday, 9 March 2020), which is the agreed schedule for sending infectious material by courier between the Health Services Authority and the CARPHA laboratory. The results are expected within six days. Medical Officer of Health, Dr Samuel Williams-Rodriguez assures the public that people affected are in self-isolation at home, with one in isolation at Health City. As such, these cases are being actively monitored by health care professionals and pose no existing risk of onward transmission. The Public Health Department is in daily contact with all persons who have agreed to comply with best procedures for self-isolation while they wait for the results from CARPHA.Noting that around the globe in countries with reported cases, the number of negative test results is exponentially higher than positive results. Dr Williams observes that in the United Kingdom as of 6 March 2020, more than 20,000 people have been tested but only 163 have been confirmed positive.At the same time he says it is essential that Caymanians, residents and visitors continue to practice preventive hygiene. Recommended measures include: ·         Regularly washing hands with soap and water (and using alcohol-based hand sanitiser if soap and water is not available),·         Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue if available, or flexed elbow as necessary, and ·         Maintaining social distance; that is three to six feet of distancing between two persons. “These things may seem insignificant but they have been proven to prevent infection”, Dr Williams remarks. “A simple way to remember your personal responsibility in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 is to “Catch ‘em. Trash‘em. Contain ‘em.”   For more information about minimising their risk, persons should visit www.hsa.ky/coronavirus. (For mobile www.hsa.ky/public-health/coronavirus).Given the global spread of the coronavirus, Chief Medical Officer Dr John Lee urges members of the public with flu-like symptoms who feel there is a risk they may have the disease, to contact the HSA at flu@hsa.ky or via the flu hotline 1-800-534-8600.  -Ends- Notes to Editors:  On-Island testing for COVID-19 should be available within the next two weeks through the Health Services Authority. This will augment pre-existing testing capabilities through CARPHA. The ‘flu hotline number is 1-800-534-8600This is one of the messages I received through airbnb."
"Right we are awaiting results. Everyone sees the updates. Two people have not been diagnosed with the disease. Rather five are awaiting test results. The secondary problem with this disease is the amount of misinformation or at least mid directed information that is out there. As of the last update there are no confirmed cases in Cayman. To me that equals no diagnosed cases. Maybe I am confused by the wording. Once the test results are in we may have anything from 0 to 5 confirmed cases.Edited: 1:18 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"I just talked to the place I rented a condo through directly about my 4/18-4/25 trip. I'm 36 days out so the ""... or get off the pot"" period is about to pass. My question was what happens if my group is UNABLE to travel (flight cancellations, travel ban, infection, etc). Their policy was pretty fair. Both Delta and the condo allow for free rescheduling if I'm UNABLE to travel (or 50% off of their normal less than 30 day cancellation policy). I did use a CC with travel insurance and bought Delta's too. It doesn't look like the travel insurance covers epidemics. Although, they seem to be making an exception for the red flagged countries - the US isn't on that list YET - that may change in the next month."
"as an owner of a condo in grand cayman, i would allow the person to cancel under the circumstances. health before all else."
"I've never bought trip insurance before but did for our GC trip in the current environment, because the condo we are staying in is expensive and our flights were really expensive too. I got a cancel for any reason, up to 48 hours per departure. It only covers 75%, but that's a lot better than losing everything!"
I too am an owner of a condo along SMB. Our property will gladly hold a deposit or refund as requested. These are extraordinary times.
"BE ready for travel restrictions.........As of this morning, the government of Grand Cayman will be holding a meeting today to discuss travel restrictions from certain countries. From the Cayman Compass: “We are going to have to make some radical and drastic decisions that are going to impact social behaviour, travel and, indeed, people’s economic circumstance, but we believe that unless we do so, the results will be potentially devastating, indeed tragic, for these islands. We will not allow, because of a lack of willingness to make hard decisions, the situation to obtain which is currently the case in places like Italy and the United States,” McLaughlin said.I see a restriction coming for travelers from the US. I have CSA travel insurance, but it does not cover events of ""force majeure"" i.e., unforseen events. I am supposed to arrive at the end of May, hoping for the best and hoping my townhouse owner is reasonable."
"CherylB - Thats so nice of your condo. Our reservation starts 4/18. I need to cancel by 3/19 to get my deposit back ($1700). I've asked if they have altered their cancellation policy due to Coronavirus and they have said no. So at this point I may cancel next week and then wait until a day or 2 before our flights and see what the situation is and possibly rebook. They seem to have plenty of open units the week we are going so I feel like I'd get something, but I also feel bad about cancelling. I want to go, but worried about Cayman not letting in US visitors when our vacation day comes."
At this point I'd be pretty shocked if they didn't shut down travel from the US. We will probably be at 10k+ by early this week.
Sadly I was right. The condo we rented from is offering refund or apply deposit to future trip and get 15% discount. I'll probably take the refund...bird in the hand...though I do hope to return anyway later this year or next spring.
"I hope this is a once in a lifetime event so I don't think its unreasonable for hotels/b&b/resorts to waive their cancellation policy versus risk their clients health, welfare and possibly their life. I personally want to know those entities that are offering full refunds and I want to know those that have no customer care and are only thinking about their pocket during this unprecedented time. We will go to the Caymans when this world pandemic ends and we will stay at resorts/b&b's that cared about our welfare and health. Once I get responses from both of the places we were suppose to stay at, I will let you know this information. Lets reward kindness and care. Stay safe."
So far hotels such as the Ritz Carlton as well as some of the condo properties are actually maintaining work permits for their employees while they shut which is huge. It gives those individuals a chance to stay on island or return to their jobs when those hotels reopen. Not sure if the same places refunded deposits across the board but will say this is not a time they are shoving money in their pockets. Smaller venues do not have as many people to look after but then again do not make as much. Pretty much across the board they are taking care of the people who rely on them to live. There is much more to this picture than a deposit on a vacation.
"The fact is most people are going to take a hit. Large corporations and the wealthy can endure far better through this TEMPORARY crisis. While it is is quite upsetting for those who do not get refunds on a vacation, far worse and more difficult impacts which will be more long lasting is the reality many people are facing."
"I am hoping to visit at the end of May. Property management for my condo has agreed to extend the cancellation deadline for a full refund to 31 days before arrival, instead of 61. I got it in writing through VRBO messaging and confirmed with my credit card that I will be able to dispute it if they don't honor a cancellation with full refund (minus a 4% admin fee). That being said, I am flying on Cayman Airlines and who's to say they won't go bankrupt or seriously alter schedules after this three week shut down. Hoping for the best and that this virus gets knocked down soon."
"I think that we are going to see a big reduction in the number of condos that are available - not just on Cayman but in the industry in general. Many small owners don't have deep enough pockets to refund everyone and stay in business. As retrip says, we are probably going to see the same for dive ops and restaurants on island.As companies lay off people on work visas, officially they have to leave the island within a certain amount of time unless they can find a new work sponsor, which will be few and far between. Hopefully the government will do something about that, otherwise there could be an extended period after the crisis is over for the tourism business to recover.The hotel chains themselves will probably be ok, but similarly there will be a shortage of workers on island when they want to ramp up again.The one good thing that Cayman has going for it over other islands is that tourism isn't their number 1 business sector - it's number 2. Other island countries are going to take a far bigger hit.These are truly extraordinary times."
"I think the opposite might actually happen. Single or small blocks of condos can get sold quickly, as long as the management company stays in place (seems likely considering reasonably low overhead). Hotels are (usually) not owned by the larger branded company, but by investment companies, LLCs, etc....when they go bust it will take a lot longer to sell the property."
"One of the selling points of condos on the island is there potential for vacation rental income - you often see that listed on the CIREBA site. Until the tourism business takes off again on island, those numbers are complete pie in the sky. I'm not sure that people are going to rush to buy them.But I suppose this is all crystal balling. None of us know."
"We have a reservation for April 15th and are being told no refund which is understandable; however, we are charged $175 if we may a new reservation within the next 48 hours and $350 if we decide a new date after 48 hours. This seems really steep fees for a situation totally out of our control. Anyone else seeing such fees? We either have to pay the fee or lose a $1500.00 reservation entirely."
"<< ""This seems really steep fees for a situation totally out of our control. "" >>Irrespective of whose control the situation is within (certainly not the condo-owner's either) spending $175 in this situation to prevent a guaranteed $1500 loss doesn't sound terribly steep.Can't imagine why you'd wait 48hrs -- thus incurring the $350 fee -- to change your reservation. What information might you expect to get in the next 48hrs that would suggest that your April 15th travel is going to happen... given that the Cayman Islands have shutdown incoming flights for the next three weeks.You've got two days to make a relatively cheap, and exquisitely simple decision."
@Frustrated Traveler: Who is charging you these fees?
"Just got my money back from my condo that was reserved for 4/18-4/26. They were letting you use the deposit for another week, but you had to be renting the exact same unit. I do want to go back to that condo, but dont want to be restricted to the dates that unit is available, so canceled instead since we are more than 30 days out. Hoping to reschedule for later this year. How is Thanksgiving in Cayman?? I've only ever been in April/early May."
VT traveler; that is awesome that the condo owner is giving you a refund. I would like to know who they are as I would book with them in the future. Our condo owner has a hurricane cancellation policy but obviously nothing for a total world shutdown and is trying to keep the money.
All the booking platforms we use to market our condo are recommending 100% refunds for affected guests and making it easy for owners to accommodate.
"Rebecca T - They are giving me a refund because their normal cancellation policy is a full refund if you cancel 30 days prior to reservation. So I am 33 days out I believe so I get the full refund. Its not like they are giving me something special by giving my deposit back to me.If I didnt cancel, or waited past 30 days, I would not get a refund. I would get my deposit held for 1 year and I would have to book the SAME Unit in the condo as the one I had reserved for April. That kind of sucks if you ask me. I dont want to go in the summer or early fall. The first week I MIGHT go is Thanksgiving, and guess what? The unit we booked is already booked for Thanksgiving. I decided to cancel to get my refund.Edited: 3:36 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"Frustrated traveler...We have never encountered fees to change dates but know that depends on the regular seasonal rental rate. If changing from a low season rate to high season obviously the cost would increase. However, given this particular situation and cruise ship ban for at least 60 days, the 3 week airline arrival could very well be extended. I think I would just pay the $175 and chose another date for your vacation."
"""How is Thanksgiving in Cayman??""American or Canadian? They don't celebrate it per se in Cayman.There will usually be turkey available more than usual, both in grocery stores and restaurants. Other then that it's pretty much business as usual.For those talking about hurricane policies - right now I am in the situation where my insurance company is saying that the place is perfectly habitable, and that the hurricane policy covers when the place is not, due to bad weather. It doesn't give any protection in a case like this. I'm sure that other owners are in the same (sinking) boat."
#51. First if all thank you Testudo for your snorkel blog which we used on our first week in Grand Cayman. We are now on Cayman Brac scheduled to go back to Grand Cayman and spend another week there in a diff.area. We obviously will be leaving here and flying home Saturday before the sirport closes for at least 3 weeks. We rented through VRBO and they are not refunding any money unlike Airbnb. Was wondering what other companies you were referring to. Thanks again
"We use VRBO and TripAdvisor/FlipKey. If the VRBO owner is not giving you a refund, they are human garbage. Here's the VRBO note to owners:https:/…Edited: 6:23 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"I have a holiday house in Rum Point that is a full time rental. We have offered full refunds or an opportunity to reschedule at a later date, whatever is convenient for our guests. Every guest has offered to reschedule-a very good sign for this island. We are using those rental funds that we have already received to engage our support staff in doing work now on the house that we would usually schedule for October, when we block bookings for repairs. I have already scheduled the workers-they get paid during this tough economic time and the house will look great when guests begin to reappear. So to those guests who have rescheduled, a hearty THANK YOU. Those funds you have left on island will keep locals fed, housed, and employed with dignity and for that I can't thank you enough. Caymankind coming back at us."
"TravellingBritNY - Oh, I don't care about the holiday of Thanksgiving. More wondering how the weather can be, if its a good time to visit, etc...I could care less about eating Turkey."
Thanksgiving (US) is a lovely time to be here. We have celebrated it here for 10 years and have always enjoyed great weather. Most everything from slow season has reopened.
"Thank you, i will reach out to her again"

"Hi Stayincayaman, sorry if I wasn't clear.I own a condo on Grand Cayman that I have used to do vacation rentals. I don't own any other properties. While the market was strong for vacation rentals, the going rates just about covered the costs of the unit (condo fees, utilities, etc.). I took out an insurance policy to try to cover things like renter damage, hurricane damage, etc. There is a ""loss of business"" coverage clause in there.Unfortunately it only overs loss of business due to damage on the property, not the complete shutdown of the tourism business in the country.So, we will be able to claim nothing back - while VRBO and AirBnB have this ""cancel at no cost"" policy, that's only their fees, and they do not pay anything to the owners.I am refunding some of the money, but it's money that I just don't have. Like other business owners on the island, this is probably the end of the line for me in the tourism business on Cayman.So thanks for the ""human garbage"" comment Testudo. I kinda take that personally."
"I will no longer be booking through VRBO because unlike Airbnb, they are leaving it up to the owner if they WANT to give a refund to travelers that are UNABLE to fly to the island due to airlines cancelling flights. Some of us booked our vacations almost a year ago for a son's SENIOR TRIP spring break that is not getting rescheduled for Thanksgiving or some other time! I feel for the owners but keeping 4k of money is garbage."
"I had the same thing happen when JFK was closed after Sandy. Things outside the norm happen. Trip insurance is there to protect you from those things. I just saw the human garbage reference. Really? Is ugly name calling what we are reduced to now?Edited: 9:37 am, March 18, 2020 "
Trip insurance does not cover pandemics
Well then some things we just have to suck up in life and if it is not something tragic consider how lucky we are not to be in someone else’s shoes.
"""So thanks for the 'human garbage'"" comment Testudo. I kinda take that personally.""Sorry if your financial plan didn't incorporate periods of non-rental revenue income, but that is just poor risk planning in my view.I view renters as my customers and always try to do right by my customers. I stand by that characterization.Edited: 12:22 pm, March 18, 2020 "
I will add that I can empathize with the possibility of losing a cherished holiday property in Cayman; but my conscience still makes do the right thing.
"We are booked for May 3 to 10 in Rum Point, we always book through Cayman Villas, or this time Grand Cayman Villas, we have booked both, they have been incredible in keeping us up to date and offered to reschedule without penalty. One advantage to booking through the premier booking sites vs. Air BnB or VBRO"
I also will not be using VRBO in the future.
"If you are relying on rental income to have a vacation home, you probably should not have a vacation home. If you are relying on getting a full refund for a vacation no matter what happens to prevent you from going, you probably should not plan a vacation."

"VRBO and TripAdvisor don't forward any funds to their owner/clients until the check-in date of a reservation. So, if using these platforms, an owner never has possession of any rental proceeds prior to a booking. In these cases, issuing a refund is simply like declining a reservation, there is no out-of-pocket expense to the owner. Unfortunately, it sounds like some owners may anticipated committing those funds towards other obligations and that is what is giving them pause on issuing refunds. When using any rental platform, prospective renters should be clear on the cancellation policy offered by any listing they are considering. Most permit the owner/listing to determine the type of cancellation policy they want to be in effect. So choose wisely."
"We have a reservation at Christopher Columbus Condos June 9-16. I'm still hoping things are better by then. But this is part of the message they posted on their website today. See link to read the entire message.""We wanted to send you this notice to inform you of the travel restriction. If you have a reservation that's affected by the airport closure or by COVID-19 in general, we want to assure you that you will get a full refund on your reservation from Christopher Columbus Condos. (American Express cardholders will get a full refund on the payment CCC received, but we will unfortunately not be able to refund the fee that American Express charges.)""https:/…"
"We returned home today, halfway through our planned trip, and received a credit for the lost time towards our stay next year. Many of the guests at this small central SMB complex are repeat visitors, and all were graciously extended the same. Truly a class act and we are beyond appreciative."
"Thank you Testudo for talking sense here on these forums.My KiwiKai condo owner refunded my entire 3200 and change. If the world doesn't end, guess where I am going back to and renting from? Yup the same person the same condo even if it is higher priced that the current amount even if a property with more amenities is cheaper.That said, I won't be going through VRBO."
"I think for the most part owners and mgmt companies are trying to help everyone. This is what people try to do. The amount of contentiousness with regard to what “may” have been happening was truly disgusting. Some people will do the right thing or at least try to, some people won’t. It goes both ways with everything in life I guess. I would caution that as many as 2000 work permit holders are scheduled to leave before the airport ban on Sunday. Most of these are service industry folks. It is likely many will not get back for some time if at all. When places do reopen they may be on limited staff for a while. If you are holding a reservation for a few months out keep an eye on local news. Hopefully we will soon be announcing reopenings rather than closings. Stay well."
"We had Spring Break plans with another family friend, and we both rented Condos from the Reef on the East End. Our Friends received a full refund through Airbnb.com, and we are still working out the details with the owner/leaser through Vrbo.com! It would be difficult for me to recommend Vrbo.comI understand this is hurting condo owners during the busiest time of the year, but not offering a refund on a product or service that you can't deliver doesn't sit well. I can't physically fly into or out of Grand Cayman, and I am told the Condo Complex is closing as of Monday. Therefore, the condo owner can't rent to anyone. I don't feel anyone should benefit financially from this. I am a small business owner, and I have never been paid for a product or service that I couldn't deliver!I am afraid I will be disputing charges to see where this goes!"
"Full disclosure since everyone is pretty negative on VRBO, we recieved a full refund for 2 rentals. Owners were very easy to work with at both locations. Both rentals had a no refund policy. 1st rental was to start tonight in Saba, 2nd was to start Sunday in Anguilla. Both rentals through vrbo"
"I started disputing our charges 2 days ago through the credit card. There were 3 different charges, first payment and the second payment and the deposit. Happy to say i received notice of full refund on deposit,$1,500 so far. Waiting to see what happens. We were suppose to be there 3/21.."
"Nice to see many more full refunds are happening! Common sense and fairness dictates that when due to this unprecedented crisis you are banned from traveling due to airline flight suspendings , closing down of the property you should not be responsible to pay for those things."
We are getting the same pushback from our vacation landlord refusing to refund 100% of our money. She wants to blame us for not taking vacation insurance. We did not cancel the reservation rather the government will not allow us to travel there as US citizens. She encouraged us to rent directly from her offering a discount by not going thru VRBO. We rented from her the previous year. Everyone is struggling and this is not the way to treat tourists in a world wide crisis. We lost many thousands of dollars in the condo we own when the ski resorts were shut down by the state governments. We refunded everyone 100%.
Our cc company is not helping due to the landlords cancellation policy. This is not right since we never cancelled our trip but were not allowed to travel to the Cayman Islands because of travel band. Please let us know how you were able to do it. We paid in two installments and no we have to file 2 separate claims.
Some interesting perspective from a very active TA rental property owner:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10…
"Once again, Travel Insurance does not cover pandemics...."
"TBNY, thanks the informative re-post . I am not an owner, but it offers good insight from an owner's perspective.Edited: 6:53 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"lovecayman wrote:""If you are relying on rental income to have a vacation home, you probably should not have a vacation home.""How many people do you think can afford *not* to rent their homes, but because it's so damned fun, we let you come in and pee on our carpets for a few hundred bucks?Vacation home renting is a BUSINESS. As such, it should generate income. Jesus, the nerve.Edited: 2:33 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"""Once again, Travel Insurance does not cover pandemics....""Neither do owners. ;)"
"Sorry you are offended by my perspective. Even sorrier about how you view the people you depend upon for your rental “business.” BTW, I also said that those who cannot afford to risk the loss of vacation dollars probably ought not plan expensive vacations."
"I guess renting a vacation home is technically a business, a side business for us. We went into purchasing our vacation home understanding the financials and making sure we could cover all our expenses without the need for supplimentary income from renting. Rental income sure is a nice plus, but not a necessity.Our philosophy when renting is to treat our guests like we would like to be treated; from the intial conversation, to the financial transaction, to the accommodations, to the check-out and post stay. If a guest physically cannot make it to our home due to travel restrictions that make our home technically unavailable; I'd consider that not being able to deliver on our portion of the contract. Just one way of running a business, obviously there are others."
"lovey, ""Even sorrier about how you view the people you depend upon for your rental “business.” You have no idea how I care for my guests. Clue -- nothing but 5-star reviews and all guests affected were offered and received 100% refunds. I did not even suggest that they receive anything less.It *is* a business, regardless of what you want to call it. I run a great one.We're finished."
“Pee on our carpets for a few hundred bucks” shows no respect or appreciation for those you want to fund your business! Testudo maintains a far better and nicer “business” approach.
"Cancelled condo one day prior to reservation (3/14) due to covid19 conerns. I purchased trip insurance but pandemic cancellation was not covered. Owner did not acknowledge cancellation, nor has she responded to multiple emails regarding status of refund or credit for future stay. Any advice?"
"I think you are blessed if this is your source of concern right now. There are so many who are set to lose much more than disposable income if it even ends up that way. Maybe the owner cannot answer your email right now for more pressing reasons.Edited: 9:22 am, March 26, 2020 "
"I wish there was a way to track all the ""non-refundable"" properties when things go back to normal.So we avoid giving our money to folks who value money at this unprecedented time. Instead stay at testudo/or others who issued refund and made things right!Edited: 9:37 am, March 26, 2020 "
"For the record, since I was indirectly called ""human garbage"" for some of the things I said about refunds, trying to present a side other than that of the guests, I have refunded all guests 100% of what they paid.I am now out of the vacation rental business, so repeat/returning customers are not a consideration."
I wouldn’t worry about it too much. Many in the tourism business will be bankrupt and may not be still owners of properties anyway. It is unlikely my business will ever reopen and I know several who are in the same boat. Don’t think making up such a list will be a priority. I am no longer an owner of a vacation rental property and haven’t been for years. The reason we pulled out was because of how some guests treated our home. It was not the way We treat hotels/condos etc that we stay in. As TB tried to point out there are two sides to every story. If you don’t want a restrictive cancellation policy going forward don’t book a place that has one. Not rocket science.
"<< “ So we avoid giving our money to folks who value money at this unprecedented time.” >>Is the irony — of ALSO being someone who values money at this time — not apparent? Certainly unprecedented.:-0I’m not arguing one side or the other of this issue. Just pointing out that this is a zero-sum game. You don’t want to take a loss due to circumstances that are not your fault. But you want someone else to take the same loss... which is due to circumstances that are not THEIR fault.Of course government restrictions on travel, etc further clarify the necessary path for owners here... but the righteous indignation among many renters is a bit much.Edited: 9:52 am, March 26, 2020 "
"<< “ I wish there was a way to track all the ""non-refundable"" properties when things go back to normal.” >>There is... read the rental contract before signing it.As mentioned above... not rocket science."
"This is a situation where one party or the other is going to lose money. Be thankful if you are not one of the ones who,is going to lose your life."
"<< ""This is a situation where one party or the other is going to lose money"" >>A friend of mine, who is a professional arbitrator, always says ""If a settlement results in both parties being unhappy... it is probably a fair settlement."""
"Glad to be reading that most intended renters are getting refunds. Goes to show that given the chance, most people will do the right thing, even if it is financially painful. We're all in this together, whether we like it or not, and we all have to do the seemingly little things to help see each other through to the other side."

Recommending versus making it a requirement for a property owner to refund the money when a guest is unable to access a property they reserved means that I won't be using your services in the future either. It should be a requirement for listing properties with your service.
"""This is not right since we never cancelled our trip""Did the person you rented from cancel your trip or refuse to let you use the place you rented? If not, doesn't your own logic say it's not right for you to insist ona refund?""Vacation home renting is a BUSINESS.""Well, renting your ""vacation home"" (is there a reason for that term?) lets you claim business deductions, but how many of the people who have a 2nd home that they rent out bought it because they wanted to start a business, considered their options and decided that renting out a vacation property was their best choice? I'd guess that the vast majority wanted a vacation home and recognized that the only way they could afford it was to use it themselves for a few weeks every year and rent it out the rest of the time. I'd bet that far fewer of them make their living primarily from renting their vacation home.I'm not suggesting that either side is right or wrong, but simply observing reality as I see it. Some people who depend on the income to pay the bills will lose rental properties, and some people who had to scrimp and save to go on vacation will lose much of what they didn't need for their mandatory expenses. And while I'm not arguing who's right or wrong I feel more sympathy for the people who struggle to go on vacation than the people who have trouble paying the cost of owning their vacation property.“ I wish there was a way to track all the ""non-refundable"" properties when things go back to normal.” Anyone reading this is looking at a way to track just about anything about a visit to the CI. There's nothing wrong with posting factual information about your experiences, and there's nothing wrong with starting a thread that other would be vacationers might contribute to."
