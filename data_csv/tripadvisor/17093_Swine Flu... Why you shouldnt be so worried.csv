"Im a Canadian, so I use Canadian facts. Feel free to ""alter"" them to fit your home nations statistics as well.1) Swine flu is not guaranteed to kill. As a matter of fact, if you get it, chances are youll be just fine within a week. This doesnt mean its 100% ""safe,"" but CHANCES ARE.2) The chance of you catching a human flu are much higher. Thats right, you have a much better chance of catching the common human flu rather than the swine flu... regardless of whether or not youre in Mexico cit, Cancun, or anywhere else. 3) To put things into perspective, did you know about 4,000 people die from the human flu every year in Canada? Think about that for a second... 4,000 people... How worried are you about the human flu? Not very much I take it... Well, then why would you be so worried about the swine flu, which has yet to kill anyone in Canada.4) There are already medications which have been proven to work on the swine flu. Specifically, Tamiflu. 5) It is HIGHLY likely that all of this chaos will be settled within the next couple weeks. Its unfortunate that the news makes it out to be such a big deal, but it also helps because it demands attention, better hygiene, and further medical support.5) Wash your hands6) Go to Coco Bongo and have the time of your life.

Please read this before even thinking of canceling. 
"So that 4,000 canadian deaths per year means that with 33-34 million canadians the mortality rate if every canadian got the human flu would be about .1212 percent(1per,1000)...a very low deathrate for the flu. that assumes that every canadian gets the human flu every year.. obviously, if only half gets the human flu that means the mortality rate goes to about .2424 percent. the mortality rate for this strain of swine flu is close to 7-8%. that means that if every canadian got this strain, one could expect 4,000,000 deaths...yikes"
"oops 264, 000 deaths"
The high death rate in Mexico was because health officials didn't know what the new flu was (and therefore how to treat it) until it was too late for many people. That death rate has slowed right down to almost nothing now.
all cases in canada are recovering
"Do the Math.... 4,000 Canadians out of a population of 30,000,000VS80 Mexicans out of a population of 10,000,000Now, there are obviously other factors such as:1) how long the human flu has been known VS this new swine flu... more time = more chance of precautions and medications2) how many days are calculated into the calculation... if swine flu has started in the past 2 week and claimed 80 lives, thats 5 lives lost per day... compare that to Canada's 4000 lives lost in 365 days, which averages to about 10 lives lost per day.Either way you look at it, things as of right now are being blown out of proportion. "
"oops, forgot a zero in the population of mexico.... 110,000,000 is what it should say.Human flu > Swine flu, thus far. "
"Anything is bound to stir emotions when you attach ""pandemic"" or ""epidemic"" to it. Only time will tell, and with comunication around the globe taking minutes via the net, it wont take much time to figure out if this is the big one or not. But I'm sure the media hopes it is...can you imagine what the advertisers would be willing to pay for a slot between ""epidemic"" updates?"
"Unfortunately unlike the seasonal flu, the Mexican swine flu has killed over 100 aged 25-45. Seasonal flu's morbidity N. America is typically limited to the very young, very old and those with immune issues. That makes this flu a great concern. Regardless of your opinions of the Mexican government or their health system, you'd be wise to exercise caution and i'd further recommend a dose of empathy. Lastly calculating a national morbidity rate is best done after the pandemic has run it's course. Considering the outbreak is less than a week old, 1000+ infections and 100+ dead may not be so comforting as the virus is seemingly just beginning..."
"I'm one of those seriously thinking of cancelling my trip... not because of fears of catching the flu, I'm about as concern about that as I would over catching the everyday common cold, but it's the aftermath, as this thing grows and spreads, what are the implications when we return, are we going to get hassled at every airport that we go through (transiting thru Denver then to Calgary)? Are our kids' schools gonna overreact knowing that they were in Mexico? Neighbours? Friends?"
"I'm not actually too worried about the flu itself; now they've identified it and people are getting treatment the death rate appears to be slowing. You can't compare it to the Canadian example though, as those stats have been taken over a year; this virus has only been present in Mexico for a matter of weeks, so as yet it's difficult to judge how serious it is or isn't.My concerns center around travel, and I know I'm far from alone in this. I'm concerned that a) our holiday will be canceled and we'll have to go elsewhere; not the end of the world, but this is a big holiday for us and I've been really looking forward to our stay at the ERC; b) flights are significantly delayed. Again, not the end of the world, but I don't fancy being holed up in Cancun airport for a couple of daysc) flights are canceled AFTER we've got out there, and we end up stranded with no money: not an ideal situation, esp as I could end up in serious trouble at work if this happens.People have very valid concerns, if not about the effects of the virus, then about whether they will be ALLOWED to travel, and if not, what options that leaves them.Also, despite the fact I'm not concerned at present, I think it's premature and naive to say the least to start laughing it off as something that is harmless; I don't believe for 1 second that the WHO and other authorities would be so concerned if it really was a harmless little cold we don't need to get our pants in a twist about"
