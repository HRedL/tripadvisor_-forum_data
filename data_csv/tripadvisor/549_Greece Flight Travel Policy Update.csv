"As expected, the Greek Government just announced an extension of suspension of passenger transport flights until at least May 31 to and from all airports in Italy, Spain, Britain and the Netherlands. Non-European citizens will be temporarily banned from entering the country until the end of the month, flights to and from other European countries will be allowed until earliest May 31 only via Athens Airport (only for permanent residents, diplomatic, military or humanitarian personnel, aircraft crews or those who obtained a permit for their trip from a Greek consulate). Extension of the ban on flights to and from Turkey, Albania and North Macedonia until at least June 15.The decision was taken on the basis of the European Commission's recommendation to all Member States of the Schengen area, to extend until June 15 the temporary ban on all unnecessary travel of third-country nationals to the EU. The Commission's approach to restarting movements first provides for the gradual lifting of restrictions on the EU's internal borders, with the relaxation of measures at the external borders following a second phase."
"Excellent SteveSitia no real surprises there .Some one on the ground in Crete who is fully aware of the situation. Thank you.Keep up the good workEdited: 8:52 am, May 15, 2020 "
Thanks for the update SteveSitia!
"Are ferries from Italy still going to be permitted, plus are land borders with other countries open or closed."
"The list of countries from which air travel will be banned seems to have some strange omissions. Belgium, Sweden and France all have higher death rates than the Netherlands."
On borders have a look at this link https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co… (Ferries from mainland Greece to Crete are starting on Monday).
Thank you for keeping us updated SteveSitia
"Keith, re Ferries from Italy, A shipping Ministry announcementAmong the measures are maintain a safe distance of 1.5 metres from others during embarkation and disembarkation, allowing one person per cabin, use of face masks for all, both passengers and crew, spreading out passengers so they do not occupy adjacent seats and, for passengers on international (Greece-Italy) routes, the taking temperatures as people board and the submission of a statement of health before departure.Vessels from countries where lockdown measures still apply will not be allowed to approach Greek ports.Edited: 12:45 pm, May 15, 2020 "
I doubt they will take passengers on the ferry from Italy as the suspension of passenger flights to and from Italy is extended until at least 31 May 2020 at 23:59.
"@Nicksy IAbsolutely agree with you on this. Moreover:Of course they won't. And that ""won't"" will last long after the mentioned date!I don’t know why deception and self-deception. Some are prone to this harmful habit."
"Agreed, Nicksy & Ntragon."
"I still do not understand why Germany and France are on the white list? Plenty of infections even there, 180000 each. Not so behind Spain, Italy and UK 230-220 thousand each."
"Indeed Keitht and Florian. Don't understand either why the Netherlands is on the list and not Sweden, Belgium, France. Strange!"
"Posts 7,8 and 9 sum it up accurately, thanks guys."
Yes certainly a lot of deception Ntragkon.
"""I don’t know why deception and self-deception. Some are prone to this harmful habit.""Couldn't agree more Ntragkon."
floriani22 it is also strange that France is exempt from the quarantine in the UK.
It has been announced that France will not be exempt.
Keith here is an update on Italy https:/…world-europe-52687448
I meant to also say that France is still exempt if the travel is for business reasons which still makes no sense (although of course money talks).
Its mainly freight drivers (obviously to allow the flow of goods to continue) and people working in Covid-19 research.
"Just to add that this applies to all business people from France and not just freight drivers, scientists or doctors."
Please can you provide a reference for the above information.
"2 French press sources & the UK's Guardian have all said France not exempt other than freight drivers & covid experts. Not that it particularly matters, as this is a Greece forum - but it will be relevant later in Summer for those people considering driving UK-Greece, who will need each transit country's rules to be clear."
"If anyone is interested in the reported policy that is being considered including business travel ""These rules were not set to apply to France, but ministers have now reportedly scrapped their blanket exemption. They are instead drafting plans for a key number of people to be exempt, including business people, freight drivers, scientists and doctors"" https:/…"
"I think there is a problem inherent in this, that there are many people who commute to/from UK to France. Whether they should be able to work from home is probably for discussion. The Metro does allude to the fact that business people are included: These rules were not set to apply to France, but ministers have now reportedly scrapped their blanket exemption. They are instead drafting plans for a key number of people to be exempt, including business people, freight drivers, scientists and doctors.Read more: https:/…"
"Every piece I have read on the subject - BBC, Financial Times, Telegraph (as well as those mentioned by Steve) have stated that it is only exempt for freight drivers and Covid researchers but maybe Metro is the oracle......."
Sorry - should have clarified - when I referred to “Steve” I meant SteveSitia !
