Is Mexico being affected by the Red Tide epidemic that's currently in the Gulf of Mexico (i.e. Florida's coast)? We're going to Rivera Maya near the end of August and just wanted to be sure...
We were just there last week and didnâ€™t see any issues with red tide.
No Red Tide but the sargassum issue is really impacting the beaches! Look at all the threads here about sargassum or seaweed. It is a mess but is constantly changing.Edited: 2 years ago
