"Any help out there? I tried to book and look for ferries from Santorini to Mykonos on Wednesday, 17 September 2008. The sites I tried show nothing available, any help? What lines do provide service? Will I be able to purchase them while in Santorini.I'm a little unsettled that none of the sites shows availability."
Hello!September schedules are not out yet. You will have to wait until the end of August/beginning of September.Sea Jet Consortium connects these islands. Usually there is a catamaran departing at 10.45am.When are you arriving? Are you going straight to Santorini or are you going through Athens?
"Actually, the schedule for the Hellenic Seaways FlyingCat 4 from Santorini to Mykonos has been out since Mid-April. It's one of the schedules that's determined and approved early on since it's so popular.http://www.ferries.gr/hfd/The reason why you aren't finding anything available then is because that's one of the no-sail dates for the FC4. Also, TH13 is half-right about the IJ Superjet. The schedule you need has been determined but is not yet approved. Check it here:http://www.tinyurl.com/66j8yeYou will possibly have another option _IF_ more schedules are added later this month. Take a morning ferry from Santorini to Paros, then take the next ferry from Paros that's going to Mykonos sometime later on in the day, So far nothing is showing for this option. There's no morning ferry that will get you to Paros early enough, so I advise you to come up with a backup plan in case the Superjet's schedule isn't approved. Consider leaving Santorini on the 16th or the 18th instead. I also suggest that as soon as the schedule is approved you book the Superjet online before it sells out. If it turns out to be the only way to get to Mykonos from Santorini on the 17th, tickets will go quickly. So keep a sharp eye out on the ferry schedule website http://www.gtp.gr."
Thanks for that BLL! I checked gtp and Hellenic Seaways and since I saw only the Sea Jet I gathered that the High Speed won't sail in September.Next time I'll be more careful!!!
"It is not necessary to fuss/worry over ferries, nor do bookings now. Simply buy them on the islands concerned. The Seajet will not be fully booked. I used it twice earlier in the year to/from Mykonos and was not even 20% full, nor indeed was any ferry on 10 connections I made in the Cyclades this year.Alternative routes are Santorini to Naxos/Paros/Syros then to Mykonos, maybe not the same day but you can overnight easy enough on any of those islands. Or simply change your date of travel.My practical advice would be to avoid those small catamarans/minimise time on them at all costs, the ride is terrible in rough weather."
"OhmiGod yes!!!!They are ok for going to Hydra and Spetses but definitely small for the Aegean!I am known for choosing destinations depending on which vessels/companies service them. I never went anywhere with a Flying Cat (similar to Sea Jet), except for the Saronic islands!"
"I took the FC4 from Santorini to Paros last year and even though the sea was calm it rocked from side-to-side, which effected me slightly because I was seated at a window on one side of the ship. I do believe that if the sea is calm and you sit along the centerline of the seating area the rocking will have little or no effect on your inner ear. I can't even imagine-and don't want to know!-what it must be like in a rough sea......."
A couple of my friends went to Folegandros a couple of weeks ago. It was 8B!Katerina told me that she would rather be at the emergency room after a gastroenteritis epidemic!!!
