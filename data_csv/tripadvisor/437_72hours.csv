I know this has been asked over and over . But still no clarificationDoes Cyprus 72hr requirement start at the point you take the test . Or does it start from the point of getting your results . Also has it been confirmed an NHS test would be accepted ??
"Quote:For Category B countries, the following documents will be required for flying to the Republic of Cyprus:a. Passengers should have to conduct, a test confirming negative PCR for Covid-19 during the last 72 hours before their travel to the Republic of Cyprus and possess a certificate which confirms negative PCR for Covid-19, issued from a certified laboratory."
Here is what is being said on the scottish government website regards testingPeople who do not have symptomsThe test is only reliable for those who have symptoms.Read more: guidance for households with possible coronavirus infection.
"I had a Covid19 test through the NHS and had to state the exact time I did the test, the 72 hours runs from the time you carry out the test. However the NHS testing scheme is not intended for travel, it is there for key workers and those who show or suspect symptoms. I had suspected symptoms which did turn out negative. The results arrive by text message. Anyone using the NHS system simply for the purpose of travel is doing so fraudulently and putting unnecessary pressure on the testing laboratories."
"I'm stressing out now. We are due to fly on Sunday 2nd and I still don't know what to do. I've emailed the Deputy Ministry of Tourism of the Republic of Cyprus to specifically ask if UK can be tested in Cyprus like Italy can, as it is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to get a test here and get the results in the correct format, in time for flight. I have received an email back just telling me to go and check the Flight Pass Website but it is unclear. I have emailed again to ask if UK falls into the below clause:Persons, in countries category B, where the authorities of these countries, are not in a position to offer Covid-19 testing to those wishing to travel to the Republic of Cyprus and following an announcement by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Cyprus, passengers of these Countries are permitted to perform the COVID-19 test upon their entry to the Republic of Cyprus.But I am yet to receive a response"
"This is how I feel. Unfortunately, although a private test is possible, finding a supplier that can guarantee results back before departure narrows the options down to one clinic in central London as far as I can see. They are going to be awfully busy. Perhaps not though at £250 a test plus the travel costs to get there.To probably the majority of Cyprus bound travellers, the reality of Category B is that they can't actually travel and they can't claim refunds. The worst of both worlds!"
"My point being Kathleen that having a test without displaying symptoms is pointless, a simple temp check on departure and on arrival, if exceeding 37.5°, if it exceeds this travel denied, if it exceeds it on arrival, tested (at your expense) negative result continue with holiday, positive, then quarantine and local health protocols to be followedEdited: 4:02 am, July 28, 2020 "
"I have received a response from the Deputy Minister of Tourism:PCR Test, is necessary for all ages, no exceptions from B Category Countries. The PCR Covid-19 test must be done within the time frame set by the Republic of Cyprus and it should be done in the country of origin. Cyprusflightpass is also mandatory. Failing to present both, one risks fine and or deportation. So no chance of testing when we arrive in Cyprus."
"Cheers for that Hayley, pretty clear"
I wonder if the Deputy Minister is aware of the difficulties of getting a test in the UK.It would appear not.

"Exactly. I did try to explain the difficulties we face but I suppose rules are rules. There is still a chance things could change over coming days but as I am running out of time before I travel, I'll have to bite the bullet and book a test and just hope the results are back in time. Risky business."

From todays Cyprus Mailhttps:/…
Slightly confusing *NHS test is accepted*. But required a hard copy .The NHS don’t provide this either way. Your results are either by text or email. So effectively makes it void
