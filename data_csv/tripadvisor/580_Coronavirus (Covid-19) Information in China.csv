Now that China seems to be actually recovering a bit...
It was on the news that today China did not get a single new case of Covid-19. And China will be restricting travelers from other Covid-19 hotspot countries!The second link provided in the OP is as useless as the TripAdvisor search function. You need to wade through 34 PAGES of lists. That's 34 PAGES!

You really have to doubt the accuracy of information coming out of China .
"#5: can you supply a reliable source for that, or is that just a bias. This is a good link. Lets you filter on country: https://covid19info.live/"

"@alphapak2017, then trust the numbers from the countries don't do the test?"
"@1NCfoodie, how true"
"Shanxi Province long-distance bus services have restarted and tourist sites have reopened. Temperature checks, travel history and contact info must be provided. People may face quarantine restrictions coming into the Province depending upon where they are coming from."
"The overall epidemic in China is getting better, but Hubei Province (with Wuhan as the capital city) is still locked down. While in other cities/provinces, about 70% of restaurants or hotels or attractions have reopened, and about half of inter-city public transport is still suspended.Travelling to China is not yet recommended from my own perspectives, as more and more cases of COVID 19 have been confirmed from international flights which arrive in China. The local authority is taking stricter measures to control the cases from oversea by enforcing quarantine for visitors, no matter if you are Chinese or foreigner."
"Beijing municipal government announced yesterday that preventive measures have been upgraded in regard to international travelers arriving. Starting today, Wednesday, Beijing will require that all overseas arrivals take a nucleic acid test ( this started Monday) before being quarantined in designated facilities ( seems to be requisitioned hotels) for 14 days. Travelers are expected to cover the costs of the quarantine which includes accommodation & meals.Also starting today, Wednesday, all inbound flights previously scheduled to land at Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport will be diverted to Shanghai Pudong International Airport so that quarantine measures can be better coordinated.Some tourist sites have started opening, such as Beijing Zoo, Badaling section of the Great Wall. Transport is restarting.Some restaurants, bars, clubs, cafes are opening up. If you are a foreigner its best to take your passport with you ( as you should do anyway) to show your have not been to badly effected places. Office buildings, shopping malls and other public places still require people to have their temperatures recorded. Several areas require people to show a “green” reading though a smartphone app called Health Code, through WeChat or Alipay.Annie"
"Mikecc46 in Shenzhen cant access this sticky so I am cutting & pasting his post here. Hope you dont mind Mike. Similar announcements in Shenzhen and, as I can't access the sticky, I'll add them here.RECENTLY, Guangdong Province has released an area-based risk rating list for COVID-19 prevention and control, which attracts wide attention. According to the Notice by Office of Shenzhen Headquarters for COVID-19 Prevention and Control on Clarifying the Risk Levels of and Requirements for COVID-19 Prevention and Control in Each District from Saturday to March 28, all districts of Shenzhen, including Dapeng New District and Shenzhen-Shanwei Special Cooperation Zone, are rated low-risk.Low-risk areas will focus on the prevention of imported cases, comprehensively resume production and normal life, and lift road traffic restrictions.As low-risk areas are not free of risks, and some of them have just been downgraded to low-risk areas from high-risk or medium-risk, residents should continue to exercise personal protection.Public places of all types including shopping malls, large-sized chain supermarkets, restaurants, entertainment facilities, performance venues, Internet cafes, hostels and hotels, public baths, hair and beauty salons, photo studios, household appliance repair services, exhibition centers, libraries, museums, wholesale markets, car dealers (including secondhand car dealers), auction houses, logistics companies, warehouses, car dismantling services, and e-commerce public service centers can now reopen. Ventilation and disinfection shall be intensified, and body temperature of customers shall be checkedAll leisure facilities including parks and greenways can now reopen. Checkpoints at entrances and exits will be canceled.Meanwhile, Shenzhen people are wondering what the hell the rest of the world are doing."
"Good website for updates on the coronavirus https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTbR2UKTQQcEdited: 9:41 am, March 26, 2020 "
Here is the update about the COVID19: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html and https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-reports-inc…
"wow, when coronavirus is over, I would like to travel around China"
"would be a good time...no crowds, no long waiting to get entry to anything...but not have to rush...will be years and years before the levels of tourists gets back to pre-virus times."
">>>would be a good time...no crowds, no long waiting to get entry to anything...but not have to rush...will be years and years before the levels of tourists gets back to pre-virus times.It was crazy during the small holiday last week..."
"We could say Tibet is more attractive than many other parts of China after COVID19. But sure there are many amazing places especially in southwest China, you can see snow mountains, fantastic scenic areas, such as the Kham in Sichuan: https:/…"
"Tibet could be more attractive if the Tibet people can practice their culture and values, they are foreigns in their own land"
"Is there a website where we can check the latest re-opening information for Beijing tourist sites? I saw the news about the Forbidden City, but I'm also curious about monitoring others like the Summer Palace, Chaoyang Theatre, Zoo & Panda Exhibity, Mutianyu, Olympic Park, Beijing World Park, Dazhalan Shopping Street, and shopping streets."
Has China closed its doors again?
"In Qingdao, schools are opened for pupils now, more and more people don't wear masks on streets or seaside, but still wear masks on metro or bus.Wuhan tested more than 9,000,000 people during last 10 days, the result is pretty good, my friends of Wuhan shared their test result on Wechat moment. There are still Chinese national flied back to China, some are infected but it doesn't matter, the test and cure is free, what we want to say is ... Welcome home."
"I wish they would publicise more that it is Chinese nationals coming back - a very few with infections - Shenzhen has had 39 so far. People see me and pull their masks up, pull their kids away, refuse to get in the lift with me, etc. Not everybody, but quite a lot."
">> People see me and pull their masks up, pull their kids away, refuse to get in the lift with me, etc. Not everybody, but quite a lot.That's true. Most locals try to avoid foreigners, don't stand together, don't take lift with foreigners. China is quite safe now but Chinese don't know where the foreigners are from and how long they stay in China...One foreigner put a paper on his back ""I have stayed in China since 2019""... :("
We don't know the real numbers in China. Chile a small country have 86.000 cases more than China. I hope that Chinese authorities will inform the real situation in China
@#27 But no foreigners have been allowed in for two months now. So the only ones they see have been here long-term.@#28 You were not here so did not see Chinese-style lockdown. I find the Shenzhen numbers - less than 500 cases for around 15 million people - quite believable. Nobody knows the Hubei numbers yet.
">>We don't know the real numbers in China. Chile a small country have 86.000 cases more than China. I hope that Chinese authorities will inform the real situation in China@#27, because Chinese wear face masks from the very beginning and main cities were locked down... Thousands of doctors and nurses arrived in Wuhan in time... Did Chile gov. or national do all the steps above?Because you can't make it, then doubt those who can?Did you trust Trump when he said ""It is a small FLU, not one than me to know COVID-19..."">>But no foreigners have been allowed in for two months now. So the only ones they see have been here long-term.Ah, yes, you are right."
"I just had a call with Hong Kong Airport and she said I can enter Hong Hong via ground from Mainland China as a USA citizen if I have been there for at least 14 days.I then called immigration to confirm and they told me to read the website and follow the rules stated there (which I have many times).""Health quarantine arrangements on inbound travelers from the Mainland, Macao or Taiwan, including Hong Kong and *non-Hong Kong residents*:""Compulsory quarantine at designated places (home or other accommodation) apart from the exempted persons under the ""Compulsory Quarantine of Certain Persons Arriving at Hong Kong Regulation""Restrictions on Entering Hong Kong""The Hong Kong SAR Government restricts any Hubei residents, and non-Hong Kong residents who have visited the Hubei Province in the past 14 days upon arrival from entering Hong Kong since January 27, 2020.With effect from 0.00am on March 25, 2020 until further notice:All non-Hong Kong residents coming from overseas countries and regions *by plane* will be denied entry to Hong Kong; andNon-Hong Kong residents coming from the Mainland, Macao and Taiwan will be denied entry to Hong Kong *if they have been to any overseas countries and regions in the past 14 days*.""So from this, As a non-resident, I can enter HK through Shenzhen bay from mainland as I have not been to any other overseas countries and regions in the past 14 days. Then would go through the 14 day quarantine at a hotel.Is my understanding correct? I wish immigration could be clearer on this, but no one there wants to take the blame if they give the wrong information when asked.I'm a US citizen in Mainland for the past 5 months and used up my 60day visa, + the one time extension + the 30 day stay permit and the entry/exit bureau here say I need to leave by the end of my permit. But there are only 3 flights out to USA a week at a hefty cost of 4000USD. :( I know I wouldn't be able to enter back into mainland, but at least there are reasonable flight prices from HK to USA."
"You might be better off posting in the Hong Kong forum. Maybe those people don't look here much.I used my 30 day entry, got the 60 day automatic extenson, by which time my visa was expiring. I went along to Shenzhen PSB and was given a new 30 day L visa. When that was finished I went along again and got a T visa good to the end of July. Either there are different rules for Shenzhen or for Americans."
"82,000 you have to be joking"
"It's quite safe in China now, and the treatment is free. Chinese people have pretty good self-discipline, wear face mask in public area, although the situation is well controlled and it is summer now... too hot, not comfortable at all, but Chinese still wear face mask, not only for ourselves, but also do something for family and community."
"Just as an update, they offered me the 30day stay permit and got to keep my 10year business visa. Although my friend had his 5 year business visa cancelled for the 60 day T/L visa in which he requested for the stay permit, so it is case by case. I will be collecting my 3rd stay permit tomorrow. So far they intend to keep giving them out till the borders start opening up."
"My first Stay Permit was for one month, my second was for two months, and I've just picked my third which is for three months. I pointed out that I'd asked for three years but they wouldn't change it."
