"KLAS - 8 News Now: Jim Murren out as MGM Resorts International CEO & Chairman, replacements named.https:/…"
Interesting ....thanks for posting this
"Very odd timing. My totally made up reason: He was cooking the books for the big internal MGM 2020 cost cutting scheme in order to hit his bonus, only this whole shut down exposed it all."
Buybacks and other financial engineering are negatives in the bailout packages...kudos to the windbag for supporting that idea
"His departure was announced just over a month ago, you posted it then. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g45963…The reason he’s hitting the news today is :“ It was announced Sunday afternoon that Murren will be taking control of the newly created “COVID-19 Response, Relief and Recovery Task Force.”Edited: 10:14 pm, March 22, 2020 "
he will be missed He did such good work A much respected man who always put others needs before his own A true captain of corporate America And other blatant fibs
With his new position as head of Nevada's COVID-19 task force he can now lie about the seriousness of the crisis in order to get the casinos open as quickly as possible. Maybe he can use his position to get federal aid into the pockets of casino owners rather than the out of work employees too.
""" pockets of the casino owners "". Do you mean the shareholders who own the stock, many in their 401Ks ????????"
Now there will be paid parking and resort fees for all homes and businesses in Nevada.
"Haha Wayne, the executives care about their options first, major shareholders second. There is no third. And I'm not saying the health of the casinos doesn't matter. But the health of the workers and residents is the first priority. Seeing them lobby for a $150 billion bail out, pushing to be at the front of the line before we've dealt with so many more pressing issues is just plain greedy."
"As a FORMER MGM shareholder, good riddance! But he now heads the task force and will be busy trying to see how to line his pockets from that power."
"Due to surge pricing, he left between 10 am and 2 pm."
Strange timing...I think
"What would be your suggestion for the timeline on setting up a COVID-19 Response, Relief and Recovery Task Force? Next year?"
