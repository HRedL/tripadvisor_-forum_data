"Hello,I'm looking for a clean hotel with good free breakfast for 3 nights June19-22. Any recommendations? price less than 250/night.Thanks..."
"Not sure what you mean by a good free breakfast. Many offer the usual continental (coffee or tea, juice and muffin or bagel). If you want a full hot meal that is served to you I don;t know any that provides that free - although some of the moderate places have buffet where they make you an omelet on top of cereals, fruit, etc. And I'm not sure if that better breakfast is worth the higher rates of the hotels."
Many of the Marriott hotels include breakfast.
"Many options with a full free breakfast,not continental. All the Residence Inn locations,Staybridge Suites Times Square and Embassy Suites for starters. Fairfield Inns have a more modest selection but far beyond a continental oneEdited: 4 years ago "
"Your budget is low. One option I see that is within budget is Holiday Inn Express Madison Square Garden for $205 + tax on expedia if you prepay (no cancellation). Check the hotel's website to compare, especially if you are an AAA or AARP member. See if that rate gets you down to budget with free cancellation.They provide a free hot breakfast buffet. Whether it is ""good"" is relative. Reviewers like it. Some say it was better than expected."
"Most Hampton Inns include breakfast. Whether they,re good is a matter of personal taste. The corporate discount code 0002635191 may drop the price by 15% at some. You need to belong to Hilton Honours on check in to use it."
"Free hotel breakfasts are usually muffins and croissants and bad coffee with powdered creamer. Even the places with make-your-own-waffles and hot eggs and pancakes, it's usually unappetizing, foggy bins of rubbery looking food or the pancake machine that spits the doughy disk out after a series of mysterious mechanical noises. The bacon at those places is usually hard and chewy or greasy, cold and limp. Yes, it's something to eat, better than an empty stomach for sure, but you can get breakfast on the go for less than ten bucks or something like $15 for a sit-down diner breakfast. If you eat cereal and milk and yogurt and toast and don't care about coffee quality, you're probably ok with the free hotel breakfast. If you want a real sit-down breakfast with eggs and bacon, I'd spring for the diner version. I guess if you're really trying to save money and are not fussy about food, then it's a way to save 20-30/day. I wouldn't choose the hotel based on the free breakfast, though. If you can get a just-as-nice hotel for cheaper, I'd go with the cheaper hotel and buy the breakfast out. You can get a quintessential NYC diner breakfast that keeps you full through lunch one day and a bagel loaded with cream cheese another, or maybe a breakfast sandwich or one of those amazing Dough bakery donuts, etc. You're in this city full of amazing food that's not too expensive. Why eat gross food for the sake of saving ten or twenty bucks a day on a big trip? You're there to enjoy yourself.Edited: 4 years ago "
We thought there was a particularly good (free) cold breakfast buffet at the Park South.Edited: 4 years ago 
"Please note that, although I find the Staybridge Suites Times Square free breakfast buffet tasty, I found the seating was inadequate & the room cramped. I understand the impulse to not go out to eat when you're barely awake but there is more to a hotel than the freebies offered."
Residence Inn Midtown East has a large dining area and a big selection of hot and cold food. You can even have a breakfast wrap with turkey and a variety of vegetables.
"Friends and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express, Times Square, price included a free breakfast which was plentiful and we had no complaints about what was on offer.Edited: 4 years ago "
"Thank you all for your reply. Sorry for the confusion about good breakfast. My son is a very picky eater (scramble eggs, bacon and/or ham only). We stayed at many hotels that said free breakfast but only serve pastries/muffins and coffee/tea. I've heard resident Inn breakfast was good but will need to check it out. Any recommendation for a good old fashion papa/mama diner?"
I dont know what a papa/mama diner is but we like Scottys Diner on Lexington. Good food and its a very New York kind of place.
"We haven't had the problems that poster#6 has. The hotel breakfasts we have had have been just fine;yes they are buffets but the eggs,bacon and waffles have been great. A bagel loaded with cream cheese or a donut is truly revolting,fattening,devoid of any nutrition and made up of fat and white flour. We will stick to hotel breakfasts when we travel"
"Haha, free hotel breakfast definitely varies and although I like the idea of eating before I leave the hotel, I don't base my choices on that. Best hotel breakfasts I've had in NY were at Hampton Inn Seaport and The Verve(RIP). Both varied from day to day and had the all important good coffee. OTOH, sitdown breakfasts and neighborhood cafe/diners are quite reasonable."
"""A bagel loaded with cream cheese or a donut is truly revolting,fattening,devoid of any nutrition and made up of fat and white flour. ""Oh, the horror. How about a Cronut? Any thoughts on those?"
Tried booking on some of the hotels but price went way up $350-400/night for Mon and Tues. Is there something going on during the week of June 20th or that's the norm?
"Staying at Best Western Hospitality House on East 45th next week.They offer free breakfast,will report back on return.Website suggests usual cereals,pastries muffins etc + some hot items.Appreciate local diners probably cheap but am paying for 4 people so even having their breakfast on some days will be good for us."
"The Residence Inn World Trade Center has an Advance Purchase rate for Marriott Rewards Members (free to join online, it's easy) for $254.00 per night (plus tax) for 1 King Studio.marriott.com.au/reservation/rateListMenu.miIt's still a very new hotel and the breakfast is hot and cold items.It's way downtown but so handy to all the sights there, such as the SOL, OWO, 9/11 Memorial and Museum, Battery Park, Wall Street etc.It's also very handy to many subway lines, including the new Fulton St subway hub."
"I just came back from a stay at The Best Western Plus Seaport on Peck Slip. They had a free breakfast that included waffles, sausage, scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs, pastries, bagels, cereal and yogurts."
"If you are staying with a son who is a picky eater, going to a diner or other nearby restaurant may be better.If it's not just you and your son sharing a bed, then hotel prices and options will be different. Rooms for 3 or rooms with 2 beds are usually more expensive than rooms for 1-2.Edited: 4 years ago "
People have different expectations about breakfast. We usually do only continental - but want fresh juice - not fake - and the croissant or bagels or muffins have to be real and fresh - not the supermarket variety. We do hot meals only for brunch - and for that there is no way we would take anything from a steam table.Have had numerous free breakfasts at a variety of different hotels since that is what was there - and IMHO none of them are worth what you pay for them.
"Joe, I just noticed your post #16. NYC hotel prices always fluctuate day to day. You are coming at an expensive time. Lots of the helpful suggestions were for hotels that had breakfast that you should check, but yes, many are over your budget for your dates.The hotel I suggested was within budget because I did a specific rate search for your dates, but you don't have a whole lot of options at that price point. You might reconsider your budget if it was somewhat arbitrary, If HI Express MSG doesn't appeal and all of the other suggestions are higher than you prefer.Or... reconsider good breakfast included and see what you find. That may be limiting your options.Edited: 4 years ago "
OK so I'm going to have to raise or double my hotel budget. Fairfield Inn & Suites vs Residence Inn vs Holiday Inn Express. which one is better?
Residence Inn is the best of those and the one at 170 Broadway is very reasonable and great location
"We don't start our day with a big dose of fat,sugar and carbs so I think you cn figure out that we don't eat junk like cronuts. Have you heard there's an obesity epidemic in the US?"
Residence Inn it is!!!Thank you everyone!!!
Good choice and your picky eater will find plenty to eat at breakfast
"The comfort inn on the lower east side (Ludlow street) is showing $712.54 (advance pay) for your dates and included breakfast. We stayed there last year and the breakfast is the usual cereal, fruit, yoghurt and toast but they also do eggs, sausage and have a waffle maker too. It's clean and close to a subway also we really love the area so we are going back this summer too :)"
"Seeing that you've settled on a Residence Inn, the one up on 54th St (near Central Park) has Member Rates starting at $203 (plus tax) for their City View rooms, non-refundable. Maybe check that one out. It has glorious views because it's the highest hotel in the northern hemisphere.I highly recommend the Park View room which is showing as $230 plus tax. Gorgeous views of Central Park, but ask for a corner room for the best experience.This hotel has a substantial hot and cold breakfast too. Better than the World Trade Center one."
"Joe, that Residence Inn is wonderful! We had a huge room and the bathroom had a large glass shower. Enjoy!"
We stopped at The Metro. Reasonably priced though I got it in a flight and hotel deal. The breakfast was continental but it certainly saw us though to mid afternoon snack. Great location too.
Hey JoeBest place ever ! Residence Inn Maiden Lane I have reviewed it with pics. Breakfast was spot on ! We had a one bedroom suite I loved the proximity to all the transport links I really liked that area. I would go back ( but too much $$$ for me. Good luck
Thank you everyone!!!Booked Residence Inn Central Park. so excited!!! Can't wait! gonna be a very long long 8 weeks...
"Joe that is the best Residence Inn I have ever stayed in. No bad views, in fact every room has incredible views."
"Which room type did you book at the Residence Inn Central Park, Joe?"
I booked the grand TS view for less than $100 more than the city view. might as well spend a little more for the enjoyment...Damn! 8 more weeks to go!
My wife suggest we should stay at the Waldorf Astoria for once in the lifetime thing. i checked the rate and it is only $435/night for superior room with 2 doubles. maybe I should fork out another $100 to stay at the Waldorf and eat breakfast at some diner? There goes my budget...Hahaha
"The Waldorf is getting pretty run down these days. It's not where I would go for a once in a lifetime stay, I think you'll be disappointed."
"No, don't stay at the Waldorf. I think you'll be happy at the Residence Inn. Just wait for your room...the lobby and hallways aren't the best, but those views!!"
No that is a dreadful trade. The views at the RI are awesome and rooms are crisp and new. The Waldorf is like a run down old dame.
Ok thanks for your invaluable replies. We will stay put at RI.
"Joe, don't forget that if you can find that exact same room $1 or more cheaper than your booking on the Marriott site, you can get 25% off with Marriott's best rate guarantee. Just hold keep the bkg you have. Then, find another cheaper rate on some other site and make a refundable booking again on the Marriott site (still keeping the one you already have) and on the SAME day as the one you just booked, put in for a BRG. It's all on their website"
Thank Sweetiedarling. I'll keep looking for a cheaper rate.
Great tip about the Marriott BRG. But I've found that the RI Central Park is a hard one to find a cheaper rate for these days. Good luck though.
"Yeah my first stay there I used the BRG and got a killer deal. The ""better rate"" you find must be for the same room type and for the same booking terms and conditions. It is very easy to submit and you do get a reply within 24 hours. Do take screen shots of the better rate you found and do explain (like you are explaining to a toddler) step by step how you found in. They do not like member only sites, just public rates."
