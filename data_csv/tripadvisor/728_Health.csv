Wonder how true this is.... Turkey are asking british people to have a health certificate to make sure they are covid-19 free.
"No formal requirement, since no no-Turks are allowed in from abroad except by special permit (not a test certificate), but this is being discussed, yes. It's all very early days yet.If blood tests become available as expected in May, then this will become much easier."
"As there is insufficient evidence yet that someone who has had and recovered from Covid is immune from further infections, the blood test will not be useful for a health certificate. The airport authorities and airlines are talking about regular swab tests either at the airport or within 48 hours of travelling to show no live infection at the time of travelling. Some form of health certification to travel is likely to be required until the global population is widely vaccinated. Just when UK visitors to Turkey were relieved of the requirement to have e-visas things got an awful lot more complicated!"
"""As there is insufficient evidence yet that someone who has had and recovered from Covid is immune from further infections... health certification to travel is likely to be required until the global population is widely vaccinated"" As there are no vaccinations which work better than having had the disease itself - unless huge amounts of time have passed or your immune system is compromised, this is a bit of a paradox, n'est-ce pas? ;)Though I agree - a quick swab test will be necessary, but in tandem with a blood, to be absolutely sure. But, really, this is all pie in the sky. No-one knows."
"There is a long thread about this information below, click on the link. However, people are requesting the thread to be closed, as there is no evidence this is true.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g298â€¦"
I agree with post number 2hullman
"GG, we should no in the next few weeks whether those who have had Covid are immune from future infections, at least for a while. Data is building up and being analysed all the time. If not, the only fitness to travel certificate would be on the basis of not having a live infection, i.e. swab test. There is currently even uncertainty as to whether those with Covid but are asymptomatic are themselves infectious (including children). Nephthys, this may be the test of how badly you want to go on holiday."
"Thank you all for taking the time to respond... Time will tell if I decide to go to Turkey or not.Edited: 5:12 pm, May 10, 2020 "
