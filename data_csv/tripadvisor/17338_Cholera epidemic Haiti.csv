What do you think about it?
"Very sad for the Haitian people, but the aftermath from earthquakes do tend to highten all these possibilities of contamination of water and food supplies that they have at their disposal.The outbreak is in the rural region Artibonite,which if you thinking about your upcoming trip to Puerto Plata, Haiti is 100's of miles from where you will be staying, this outbreak would not stop me from travelling to the DR. anyway any up to date travel clinic advisory would be released for travellers and you could get vaccinated if it was necessary if that is what you are worried about.Angie."
Dr1.com has an informative discussion going on today about this epidemicThere is no mention of it affecting the DR.www.dr1.com/forums/haiti/108005-cholera.html
"BeLive Oasis Marian in December. Would not cancel, never ever ever for any reason. But I understand that the back room staff (cleaners, gardeners etc.) are from Haiti. Perhaps it may be worth just having a safety jab before leaving."
"Alot of staff at the resorts and people in the DR in general are Haitians. I don`t think that this will make your risk of contracting cholera increase, as most of them live in the DR permanently. The risk would be those people who are travelling back and forth and hopefully they will get the outbreak contained and controlled soon. The people of Haiti have gone through enough. Although I think that something like this was expected, it`s sad to see another tragedy hit them."
"you can get cholera by contaminated water and uncooked food, so you have to be carefull with drinking only water from bottle or boiled water and eat food that have been cook or peel your fruit and vegetable!!!Also you wash your hand a lot!!! There is no case of cholera in the Dominican Republic at this point and you have to be carefull as usually and like Angie say this will not stop me from going in vacation, Hotel have hygiene protocole to follow as well and cholera do not spread from person to person but from infected water and food."
it is such a shame for these poor people. They have been through enough this year. Hopefully the epidemic will be contained soon and the suffering will lessen. My heart goes out to to them.Pauline x
"hi , we going to Punta Cana in 2 weeks..may girl friend a bit worried as well.is there a risk to get this when swimming in the Sea? we understood the Cholera also lives in the salt water?thanks, anton"
"anton,You can tell your girlfriend that there is nothing to worry about with your up and coming trip to Punta Cana and the Cholera outbreak in Haiti, as the region of the outbreak is several hundreds of miles away. It has now been reported on this morning news bulletin that they have high hopes it has now been contained in Artibonite and Central Plateau regions and will not even reach the capital of Haiti Port -au- Prince.Just go and enjoy your vacation in paradise.Angie."
