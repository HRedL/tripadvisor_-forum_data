"Good morning, We are staying on the island in late Aug and I want to book a photography session for a couple for when the light would be the best to illuminate the caldera/water/buildings and be flattering, and have fewer people to dodge.I currently have it booked for an hour at 8:00 am on Sept 2. Is that too early in the morning? Would 9:00 be better?Thank you!"
why not ask the photographer you are booked with? They should have the best information on the lighting requirements for their work.
"It's through one of those online booking agency things. (Which I don't usually ever do for just this reason...)So, I was hoping someone on here could help. Thx."
Not sure what your booking involves but there are many personal recommendations for photographers that you don't book thru some agency and a line of communication directly with the photographer in advance would be critical for me to spend the kind of money this usually costs.
"Regardless of When your session is, PLEASE don't climb on any rooftop for a photo. This has become an epidemic, even among professional photographers who should know better than to be so inconsiderate as to ignore common courtesy."
"Thank you, everyone, for your input. I decided to stick with my early morning booking so as to be able to avoid the brunt of the hordes if possible. brotherleelove, thank you also, for that information about the rooftops. I did not even think about that when I have seen photos that it could be where people are standing, although I DID think about how there must continually be dirty footprints to contend with.I'll make sure we work with the photographer to find a better alternative."
