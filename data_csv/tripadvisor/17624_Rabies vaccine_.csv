Travelling to Thailand for a week in July - do I need the Rabies vaccine?
It is advised for you to consider but not an essential recommendation. Just keep away from stray dogs.
"There is in fact somewhat of a rabies epidemic going on, so it’s a good idea to get immunized.If you do it, you’d better get at it. You need 3 shots: day 0, day 7 and day 21.Edited: 2 years ago "
"If you are staying in highly populated areas, then it's not really necessary. In the unlikely event that you do get bitten by a stray dog (or monkey (or bat)) as long as you can present to a clinic within 24 hours to get the first vaccination in the series that is sufficient. You also need to get another dose within 3 days.If you are going off the beaten track at all (eg long hikes) so could possibly not be able to get to a clinic in 24 hours, that's when having it in advance can be a good idea. Also a good idea to get in advance if you were specifically going to be volunteering at an animal shelter or similar. Or can't help yourself and try to pet a lot of dogs.Disclaimer: I'm not a medical professional, however this information is based off advice from the CDC/NHS and what my travel doctor has told me in the past."
"Need.....NOWant.....UP2U.....personally I'd wait till I got bit, unless you plan on petting soi dogs and cats.Just give a wide berth to any animals, including pets, as a few of the rabid bites, scratches, deaths were attributed to pets.I'd be more concerned with looking both ways and then again, before crossing the street."
