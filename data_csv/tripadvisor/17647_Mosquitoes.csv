I'm travelling to Kuta and Ubud in June and was wondering if I'm at risk of getting bitten by anything? I tend to get eaten alive by Mossies and sandflies. Just need t know if I should pack the Aeroguard.
"Regardless of time of year, always pack your mossie repellent. Mossies do tend to be worse around the start and end of the rainy season, but they're ever present. Wear your repellent day and night if you attract insects. I find garlic tablets also help, and the scent combined with the insect repellent makes you smell divine!"
"take some deet over with you it is extremely effective if you tend to ""get eaten alive"". also throw in your regular repellant. early morning and early evening are especially worse for mosquitoes. some areas have very few mozzies but just go prepared and also spray your room b4 you go out to dinner. also ask restaurants to place a mozzie coil near your table."

"Maybe you should be wondering about the mosquitoes in Australia at the moment.170 people in Queensland diagnosed with Dengue Fever.It has been declared an epidemic.I'm staying in Bali, that damn Australia sounds like a dangerous place!"
"Yes Cempaka, it is truly scary here in Australia!!We discovered Dee Dee on our last trip, some friends recommended it. It is a mosquito repellent we bought at Bintang supermarket and smells divine. Our 4 yr old who gets eaten alive by mossies and reacts in huge welts didn't get bitten at all when smothered in Dee Dee!We find aeroguard doesn't cut it with hubbie and daughter they usually need deet to keep those mossies away!Also you can buy some mossie coils and have them smoking at your doorstep/balcony to help ward them off and we always spray our room before heading out to dinner so hopefully when we get back any mossies in the room will be destroyed!"
