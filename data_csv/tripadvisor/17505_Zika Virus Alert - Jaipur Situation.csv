am travelling on october 18 to Jaipur and udaipur with my family with 2 yaer kid. I have booked everything and finalised. Heard of zika virus is it safe to travel am staying 2 nights in jaipur. Kindly advice what to do and if i can opt for hotel in which locality.
"I also have same question, whether to visit jaipur in October or not."
"Unless your party includes a pregnant woman then there is no need to panic . As per earlier TA comment , there are a number of seasonal post monsoon fevers of which Zika is just a variant . The outbreak appears to have been in Shastri Nagar area , in the north of the old city . You may want to choose accommodation in another area of Jaipur if you still feel uneasy ."
Can we avoid shastri nagar area stay or north jaipur stay itself.
"Skip few weeks until the problem is under control. From what we know it has spread from Shastri Nagar to Sindhi camp area, where there is the bus stand! Drive India By Yogi"
"i have my flights and accommodation arrange as well on nov 18-25, 2nights in jaipur. also worried about this issue. hope it will be under control by the end of this month so i can decide to go or not go."
We have been told that there is risk and epidemic of the virus of Zika in the Jaipur. We you have any information about this? Mi wife is pregnand and we must reduce any potencial risk. Thanks!
"I went on last month oct 18 with my family and there was no much issue and lots of tourist around. we reached back safe and secure. But since the Virus is vulnerable to pregnant women, its a risk."
"Hello, I am travelling to rajasthan on the end of december with my husband. We are spending two nights in Jaipur and i am pregnant. Any news on the situation there ? Is it really risky ? thanks"
"Ha habido casos de Zika. Pocos, pero los ha habido. Si podeis evitarlo mejor no viajar.Saludos."
you may want to watch the news and get updates from TA experts here.However I was in Jaipur in the first week of November and the situation was normally.I stayed in JW marriott which is atleast 20-25 km south of the area which has detected most cases.Edited: 1 year ago 
I'm planning to go to Jaipur on February 5th. Is it now considered safe to go if I'm not pregnant. Where were the most recent cases detected?
"Hi, did you end up going to Jaipur? Will be travelling in a few days and I’m pregnant. I don’t see any recent case reported but just want to be sure. Thanks"
