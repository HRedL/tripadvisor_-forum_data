"hi, i would like to know where in playa del carmen are the places of gathering of spring break and the dates"
I doubt there will be much gathering with the coronavirus going around.
SchmerlI have no idea why your response made me laugh! Guess we gotta laugh to get through this.
"The general answer in terms of where: Cancun, not Playa. The answer in terms of when is something that depends on when different universities take their breaks:https:/…spring-break-dates.htmAll bets are off this year, however, given the situation. And as shown there, many spring break periods have already come and gone, anyway."
Assuming there is no coronavirus anymore. Where are those places?
"they don't visit Playa? in case they do, where they gather!?"
is this a fake post? No spring break happening this year!!
"""Assuming there is no coronavirus anymore. Where are those places?""But there IS coronavirus. Stay home and stay safe."
A lot of spring breakers go to Playa del Carmen. Many stay in smaller non AI hotels or condos. The Barcelo complex is also popular with them.
Walk along the beach and you'll find them. Easy
The great majority of spring breakers still head to Cancun rather than to Playa (or Tulum or elsewhere in this region).
"Peak season within Spring Break is 2nd, 3rd and 4th week of March. Of course Spring Break goes thru April in some States but March is peak season."
"In Playa right now, no spring breakers. The beach is empty."
What a bizzare post!?!
No Spring Breakers here and very few tourists don't expect that to change anytime soon
"no, it is NO FAKE!I´m just wondering about that infoI also know this year won´t be"
"thank´s to all the answers, have been really helpfull and hope later ask for more doubtsgracias!"
