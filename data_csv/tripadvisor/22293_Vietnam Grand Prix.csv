Looking for the best area to book accommodation for the F1 in April. I can’t tell from the map what area of Hanoi it is in. Part of it seems heavily populated but others not so. Would prefer to be able to walk to the track.I can see the stadium but don’t know the area. Any other helpful info would also be appreciated. Thanks in advance
"Hi there Joann,I am also planning on going to the Grand Prix in Hanoi and also battling to figure out the specifics of the track and where good accommodation will be. As much as I would like to stay in the old city, I think the street race is a little out of the city.Have you booked your tickets for the Formula 1 yet, and if so, through which company.Thanks a mil!Tracey"
"You can order tickets for F1 racing racing in Vietnam at f1vietnamgp.comThe F1 track has a length of more than 5.5 km built at My Dinh Sports Complex.If you want to walk out to see Formula 1 racing laps, you can rent a hotel recently like:1) ROSARIAN Hotel - 1 km from the F1 racing viewing point2) Smile Inn Serviced Apartment - 1.3km to F1 racing viewing point3) JW Marriott Hotel Hanoi - 2.2 km from the F1 racing viewing point"
Has the date now been confirmed for the Grand Prix? We are visiting in April but a lot of hotels are blacked out for the first two weekends in April as the date hadn’t been confirmed
"No the date has not been announced yet. According to some recent news (ie today), the final calendar won’t be known for a few weeks."
Ok thank you. I will keep looking we were planning to fly into Hanoi the first weekend in April. Looks like we need to flip out itinerary around
May I ask how you are planning your travel when we don't know the dates yet?It's driving me mad planning for all options as I only have the Easter Holidays to play with.
Also worrying me. Was told that it would be the weekend of the 10th of April but now all the newsletters are saying still to be confirmed
17th April weekend is the most logical.Been looking too
Any solo traveling girls heading to Hanoi for the Grand Prix and wanting to meet up? At this point looks like I'm doing the solo thing
I have read that there is going to be 2 back to back races so...13th-15th March Australia20th-22nd Bahrain3rd -5th April China10th-12th Vietnam24th - 26th Azerbaijan
I’m going to do my trip in reverse I think. Start in HCMC then fly up fo Halong then Hanoi then fly down & finish in Hue and Hoi an
"In an earlier post about this I suggested that if the FIA follow a similar pattern, the draft calendar for 2019 was released on 31 August. So watch this space in about a fortnight’s time."
"I'm also planning to head out (from UK) for this race with my eldest son and wife.In the absence of any confirmation from the FIA, we are currently gambling on Easter weekend. There is no particular rhyme or reason to when the FIA release draft calendars beyond late August, though September."
Have you determined the exact dates of Hanoi Formula 1? I cant seem to find it anywhere. I am guessing it to be April 3-5. Any thoughts?
"Dates for the race weekend are yet to be announced (even provisionally) by the FIA, so all guesswork at the moment.Best guess for the FIA releasing a (provisional) 2020 calendar is late August / September."
17th April weekendBefore Azerbaijan
JojoBreda: I assume that this is a guess....you really should make the distinction clear!
Also travelling to Vietnam solo for Grand Prix :)
you can book tickets at https://www.f1vietnamgp.com/tickets/ - when i asked them at the site - they said it is expected to be first weekend in April - but calendar will only be confirmed in December
In a recent statement Chase Carey (Executive Chairman of The Formula One Group) said the 2020 calendar was close to being finalized and would be released in 'a few weeks time'.
"It's to be confirmed but it looks like they changed a lot, 3 till 5 April is on the internet news site the date"
https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.r…
"Hi all Race is dated for 5thApril released this weekend at the Belgium GP. To be confirmed at the end of the year but see no reason to change the date for a new race. Tickets booked a few weeks ago, awaiting E-visa then book flights and hotels. Going to stay in the old town can't see any issues with transport for the race, it would have been part of the biding process."
"Hi, we have planned to do this race also and dates are provisional but u likely to change we believe from the 5th April. We have put our whole holiday back a month just to do this race as it will be epic being the first ever.The closest point to the race we could find as a land mark was the stadium also so we booked a hotel about 30mins walk away (Nam Long hotel) but now worried it will be too remote for the evenings?? Doesn’t seems many restaurants eat so wondering if we should get something more central and rely on transport as it’s a major event.."
I would be interested to hear too. I booked a French guesthouse about 1.5km away. Not sure if there is much in the vicinity but reckon I'll just want to relax after the days events.I would have thought the calender is now set.What happens if we book flights and there is a date change.Whom are you booking your F1 tickets through?Any solo female travellers wanting to meet up?
"Hi tickets from GoTickets used them 4 times now very good, in UK delivered by UPS around 6 weeks before the race.Flights, well that depends on the ticket you purchase as to weather you can change dates. I can't see the date changing as its the first race at a new venue, they will have been working to that date for quite a while I suspect."
"We've booked a hotel in the old quarter - the area's around the circuit look pretty soulless so happy to take a 30 min. (traffic permitting) ride each day for somewhere interesting in the evenings.Re. air tickets - unless you book fully flex, you'll have to pay to alter travel dates (usually a fixed fee + any difference in air fare) - look v. carefully at the airlines t's and c's before booking if this is a concern for you.Edited: 9:42 am, September 03, 2019 "
Thanks to you all for the advice. Enjoy the GP
"I was there earlier this year and attended the redbull f1 demonstration at the stadium. I was staying in the old quarter and it took nearly an hour in a cab. The traffic was bad as we got closer to the stadium probably due to the road closures in the area. I will be attending the gp in 2020 and while there i checked out the area near the track as I thought i might stay there but to me it did not have the same charm as the old quarter so i will not be staying near the track. The biggest problem though was leaving the event we had a bit of trouble getting a grab or taxi and had to walk a fair way to be able to do this, about 5km."
"Interesting info Greg. I hope they will be a bit more organised with transport too and from the circuit than sounds to have been the case for the demo event. As a veteran of many British GP's at Silverstone and, back in the day, Brands Hatch where arriving at the circuit before dawn and 4 hour queues to leave the car parks were the norm, I am hopeful this race will be easier to attend! Certainly the old quarter looks a whole lot more interesting than anywhere within easy striking distance of the circuit.Edited: 2:19 am, September 04, 2019 "
Has anyone seen details such as whether or not grandstands will be covered and locations of video screens around the circuit?
Dont know. I am looking at booking at Turns 2-4. Any advice for seating there. Midway up grandstand - towards corner 2 or at turns 3 or 4? Seating will only be available in October 2019
We booked turn 7/8 grandstand just hope they will have a tv screen close by.
We're also looking at 7-8 Jenny....when you booked were you able to select seat position?
"Hi, no we have never been able to select actual seats when booking F1 tickets only the stand you wish to be in.They seem to be a great view though."
"If you go to a ticket sellers web site it will tell you if a grandstand is covered or not. You will not be able to book a seat location, but don't worry you will have a good view. Most grandstands have a view of a screen these days so you do not miss the action. All booked start/finish line with a view of the pits."
"So who is confident that the Hanoi GP (currently tentative) will happen on April 5th?That date looks fine for the Chinese GP two weeks later on 19th but I cannot see how a long-haul back-to back will work from race 1 in Australia on 15 March, then all the way to Bahrain the following weekend on 22nd - then back to China two weeks later. I hope that the 5th will happen, already reserved my hotel and will get flights too.Tickets are great value - £60 for the whole 3 days !!"
"I am not, it doesn't make sence."
"Same as this year, 17/3 Australia 31/3 Bahrain 14/4 China 28/4 Azerbaijan. So you slot two local races next to each other on the other side of the world from there base in Europe. All heavy equipment such as Transporters, Hospitality equipment can be kept local rather than sending it all the way back to Europe as this year. F1 is trying to cut costs so this calendar helps to do that. All the Hotels etc in Hanoi would have been gearing up to this date for a while, can't see it being moved. Keep the faith..."
"Unless the local organiser gets into problems (track prep etc.) I cannot see this moving.Logistically it is no better / worse than previous seasons - the F1 circus copes remarkably well with this type of globe-trotting.Edited: 5:49 am, September 10, 2019 "
"There are some higher end hotels fairly close to the circuit - but just are now booked or are very costly. I managed to get a room at the JW Marriott. Having been the Hanoi 4 times in the past, I just don’t want to bear the horrendous traffic in and around the Old Quarter - there are still plenty of rooms available there (see Booking.com) but from the Marriott, it’s just 2.4 kilometres to the circuit so very easily walkable."
We are in Vietnam then so feel we “should” go. Wondering how sustainable a day in a terraced searing will be in that heat !!!
Jeremy R it’s just 2.4 kilometres to the circuit so very easily walkable.-----Always assuming you are the only person walking that way :-) I suspect there will be thousands all going one way. Have fun.
Just seems like the worst place to have an F1 . I love Hanoi but only too happy to miss this.
"Why so Ross?I see a risk for the organisers re. attendances given the relatively high prices (no idea what the appetite for F1 is in Vietnam, but I know Malaysia / Sepang struggled despite much cheaper prices).Otherwise, the race is at a time of year when it is relatively dry and temperatures low-mid 20's. The circuit is away from the centre of town so should cause the sort of disruption races in Monaco and Singapore do...though both are highly successful in terms of attendances / money they bring into the cities.The circuit layout is potentially good with long fast straights ending in interesting corner complexes - for example the right left-left 7-8-9 is reminiscent of 1-2-3 at Sepang which provided great spectating."
Already struggling to find hotel rooms :(
"Hi Try to avoid sites that look at all the booking sites, instead go to the hotels site and look or contact hotels direct with a room request. As soon as the date was released the hotel we were looking at showed only one room type on comparison sites and nothing on there own site, quick Email and we were given prices for all there room types, and surprisingly had only gone up $10-15 a night over there previous prices a few days before. Booked a really good deal direct and cost $15 extra a night for there best room.Very impressed and they through in return airport transport as well. Give it a try."
there are quite a few 3 star hotels in the dinh thon area about 600m from the pits part of the track which are cheaply priced. It does appear most of the chain 5 star hotels immediately blocked off the dates or are quoting silly prices if you can get a room for the F1 weekend. Im sure their prices will be more sensible next year !! Also as the dates wont be confirmed for certain till early December - I would recommend making sure you get a hotel booking that can be cancelled free of charge
"Dates are OK, they have been ratified... The FIA's World Motor Sport Council ratified Formula 1's 2020 calendar on Friday and also confirmed a reduction of the sport's pre-season test schedule.https://f1i.com/news/357093-fia-confirms-202…Go get them tickets..."
HiDoes anyone know if they'll be selling tickets just for the Sunday as the sites I have visited are only selling whole weekend tickets or 2 days. Only got 3 days in hanoi so don't want to spend 2 whole days at grand prix especially if travelling to/from track is going to take awhile. thanks
"Hi BekhtI don’t believe they sell single day tickets to any F1 races around the world, but It’s not important to attend both days, unless you are a big fan."
Hey I've seen a few people travelling solo to the GP. I've already booked my whole trip (including tickets) so drop me a DM if you want to catch up! Going solo too. : ))
Has anybody seen confirmation of a/ which grandstands have cover / shade and which are open and b/ where screens are to be located in relation to the grandstands?
"Hi look on a ticket sellers web site ie gotickets that will show location and weather or not coveredEdited: 8:07 am, December 11, 2019 "
"I have elansear...lots of them.With reference to a map, obviously location is not an issue.But all I can find at the moment are computer renderings of grandstands (not unreasonably, because they don't exist yet!) However, what is not at all clear is whether the actual grandstands will be covered or not - if you have seen this information, I'd greatly appreciate you posing a link - thank you.Additionally, I can find none of the usual information regarding TV screen locations. Hence my question!"
"Hi. Understand what you say, we made a general assumption that most would be covered due to the location in the world. Would assume that grandstand would be covered and general admission uncovered. Have booked start/Finnish line if no roof may get wet !!!"
I'm more concerned about 8 hours in the sun!
I now have it on good authority that all grandstands will have no cover.
Please share.
"I sent a question to the official F1 seller for the Hanoi race who provided me with a very prompt, polite and comprehensive answer."
"""I now have it on good authority that all grandstands will have no cover.""wasn't quite as bad in Malaysia but it made for a seriously hot and uncomfortable day. If you noticed there was almost zero persons on the grassy hills surrounding the track at Sepang.Looking forward to reading some unbiased reports after the Hanoi event."
booked tickets going fast
"El Dorado Traveller ""wasn't quite as bad in Malaysia but it made for a seriously hot and uncomfortable day. If you noticed there was almost zero persons on the grassy hills surrounding the track at Sepang""This was precisely my point of reference when wondering (hoping!) if the grandstands at the Hanoi race would be covered. I attended the 2016 and 2017 races at Sepang (a great place to watch F1 cars and such a shame the government chose to withdraw support). On both occasions it was hot...unbearably so without shade. As you say, very, very few people chose to sit in unshaded areas, despite admission to these being very cheap indeed.Without shade, and given a sunny day, spectating in Hanoi is going to be tough!Edited: 2:46 am, December 19, 2019 "
"Hi All,This will be our first F1, can anyone advise the best site to buy our tickets from.Cheers Cathy"
HiBetter to purchase from the official F1 site - and the full 3 days (excluding grandstand) is just $75Please see here:https://tickets.formula1.com/en

"WRT Jeremy's recommendation, it's hard to argue with using the official F1 website, but I am surprised to see that this site doesn't seem to offer grandstand by grandstand seat maps and the facility to select specific seats, unlike one or two other selling websites. Also, US$29 for delivery seems steep to me!When I purchased tickets for the Malaysian GP, I was able to download and print the tickets. For Singapore, it was possible to collect the tickets on site...both mechanisms where very efficient and free of charge."
I'm also solo traveller going for the race. Anyone interested we can meet up for meal or drinks too.I'm staying at My Dinh AirBnB. About 10 minutes walk to the circuit
"me and 5 friendss are staying at Hanna Hotel and MassageSo 26b, Ngo 1 Dinh Thonagain about 10-15 mins walk from pits part of the track. looks like plenty of bars in thar area so happy so meet up one of the evenings"
we bought from the vietnam f1 one site as opposed to the formula1.com one and no charge for delivery - though I was told seats only allocated 2 weeks before race - suspect they are hedging about how big a grandstand to build until nearer the time !
"There are sites now allowing you to select and buy specific seats from grandstand maps, so I'm pretty sure size/layout is now fixed."
I’ll be staying on my todd at the Spring Hotel Hanoi if anyone else is around!
"Simon, thats pretty near our hotel - think you will go past ours on the way to your one - we are a group of 4 or 5 brits (one still not confirmed) and one aussie so lets catch up in the evening - email - nigel hall at hotmail dot com and i will give you the correct none spam honeypot contact details - likewise anyone else interested."

"I will be in Hanoi April 2-5, with no initial awareness that the Grand Prix was in town. Since we have already booked our air and hotel, we are going to try to get in on this event!tCan you tell me which date would be best to attend the event as a newbie (Fri, Sat, or Sun)? Also, how long is the race, what does one wear to the race, are there any activities/festivities outside of the actual race? If I am staying by the St. Joseph cathedral area, would transportation to the site be an issue? Lots of questions, I know...and I look forward to hearing back from you all."
"@SoVerySoCalSo the event takes place over the three days but Friday is just practice running and Saturday is qualifying which lasts a little over an hour and sees drivers trying to set the fastest lap in order to get the best position for the start of the actual race on the Sunday. So I’d suggest just coming for the build-up and the race on the Sunday and spend the rest of the time exploring Hanoi. That being said, the circuit will be much quieter on the Friday and Saturday and Sunday only tickets are rarely a lot cheaper than three-day tickets and often not even available at all. The actual race is usually around a couple of hours and allow at least a couple of hours for the build up (getting there, in and exploring the site, etc - there’ll be lots going on around the track). There’s no dress code - where what you like! It looks like you’re a bit of a walk away from the circuit and my personal plans are to avoid public transport on the Sunday as I’m guessing it will be manic but I’m sure there’ll be options.There are all sorts of tickets available ranging from general admission which are around $75 and give you access to the circuit and the public viewing areas - these are good for those on a budget. Next up is a seat in a stand which start from $150 and means you actually get to sit down and watch the whole race. Price of tickets pretty much depends on quality of view. Top tip - always make sure you get a seat with a good view of a screen otherwise you’ll have no idea what’s going on! Check out https://www.f1vietnamgp.com for tickets and more info.Definitely worth doing if you’re in town and never been to an F1 event before! Good luck!Edited: 4:44 am, January 08, 2020 "
"@SoVerySoCalCouple of extra things - there'll be support races throughout the weekend in other series' (which I personally have never been interested in much but you might enjoy them) and there'll be entertainment in the evenings although this varies hugely from track to track. I've seen everything from Aerosmith, Maroon 5 and Katy Perry to Britain's Got Talent runners-up at Silverstone! The newer tracks tend to be better at this but I'm not sure about Hanoi - I'm not holding out much hope. Your weekend ticket will get you access to the music stuff."
"Hi all,I'm heading over to Hanoi for 2 weeks and got 3 day pass to the race. Staying in Old Quarter so if anyone wants to share transport out on any of the days let me know...I'm about to start looking into options."
"Hi,not sure if you've booked yet but if you get your tickets through the official GP website you can choose your seat - you can't through F1 website. Here's a link: https:/…"
"I'll be staying at iStay Hotel Apartment 5 - not sure if I am even close to the entrance and google maps ain't helpful. Got tickets for turn 2-3-4 so if anyone is around and wanna meet up, drop me a message :)"
"Yes, that who I used Anna...much better than the official F1 website and free ticket delivery."
"Still tricky to estimate how far back in the grandstand you need to be to see over, rather than through, the catch fencing."

Got my tickets for Turn 7-8 Grandstand for the 3 days.And staying in Vinhomes Skylake which i like cos csn just walk the the circuit.
"Hi all,Dont want to be negative, but is anyone worried about the coronavirus and the chance of Formula 1 changing the dates of the race in Hanoi. I read they are debating whether the Chinese Grand Prix should take place and they are looking into possible date changes."
No point being worried until they make a decision.
"I agree with Simon.I've booked everything - flights, hotel, tickets - so absolutely nothing I can do until a decision is made to cancel. Completely out of my control so why worry.  If the worst happens, it'd be a shame, but that's what travel insurance is for.I guess the situation is a little different if you are still in the planning stages of visiting for the GP - maybe this risk would persuade me to hold off for a few weeks and see how things develop?Edited: 6:20 am, February 05, 2020 "
Same here - everything booked and fingers crossed.Agree with your last statement. If I hadn't already booked I would definitely be holding off :(
"I had make purchase for everything including flights, accommodation and 3 days F1 tickets.But i had decide not to go anymore cos April is very near and the situation seems to be getting worst everyday."
"Am I reading your post correctly Thomas?You have booked and paid for everything, but have now decided not to go?As I understand it, as of today in a country with a population of ~100 million there are 10 confirmed Coronavirus cases.Everyone has to take advice from authoritative sources and make their own decisions based on their perception of risk, but I struggle to understand why anyone would cancel a fully booked and paid for trip today. Whilst your hotel may be refundable, i doubt that's the case with your flights or F1 tickets.If travel to Vietnam was suspended you'd have a good chance of reclaiming your costs through your travel insurance....I don't see what there is to loose waiting to see if this eventuality comes about."
"> the situation seems to be getting worst everyday.Well *currently*, it's not getting worse *every* day. And it's only getting worse very slowly. The Vietnamese are putting everything they can into containing this. In the best case, there are no more confirmed cases and everyone who already has it gets better or dies. Or the total number of cases might go up slowly. Or it might get out of control and infect thousands or more. Nobody knows what the situation will be by April. If your government advises against travel to Vietnam, you can possibly claim all your money back from your travel insurance.I don't know when the F1 folks need to make their Go/No Go decision, but I don't see what you gain by deciding not to go now.It won't be going ahead unless the government think its safe to do so. But we'll know a lot more about it by then"
"I have decided to keep my travel plans as is, but my main reason for the trip is to attend the Grand Prix so just holding all my fingers and toes that everything remains the same,"
"manatdollar ""...In the best case, there are no more confirmed cases and everyone who already has it gets better or dies....""I'm not sure that the confirmed cases dying is strictly consistent with a 'best case' outcome!!!!"
"> I'm not sure that the confirmed cases dying is strictly consistent with a 'best case' outcome!!!!Well, best case is they all get better but logically, that's included in ""they all get better or die"". I'm from a technical background :-\"
"I’m all booked and not concerned unless and until the official advice is that either the event is cancelled or that it is unsafe to go. There are a just few confirmed cases in Vietnam, from what I see, most people that have the virus have had some form of contact with the country and area of its origin. To me, there is very very little risk - people have not stopped going to all countries where there are known cases of this virus. Finally, I would imagine that by April, this should be contained or at that a cure is developed (maybe too quick for the latter)"
"I’m planning to go to Hanoi/N Vietnam unless there’s a shutdown, but I am going to hold off on booking GP tickets until we arrive in VN on April 2nd. PS: Thank you @simontaH3bR for your earlier response to my GP question...appreciate the comprehensive info!"

Oh dear that's China gone :(Keeping fingers crossed!
I have also just read that the Hanoi GP is now in serious doubt..........
Link?
"I was originally not too concerned about this Corona Virus, however with the Chinese Race cancelled and the proximity of a China to Hà Nội , I now feel more worried than before. In addition, initially Vietnam was refusing entry to persons arriving from China - including Hong Kong (my route) - but now it’s just from mainland China. Some countries - in particular The Philippine’s, have cancelled all flights to Hong Kong and are refusing entry to flights from HK. I just hope that this doesn’t get to much worse as many going to the race will do so via Hong Kong. I’m keeping my arrangements for now and will just see what happens and will take the official advise. Fingers crossed !"
"Narinda, where did you read this?"
Not sure if i can get my refund
"Vietnam at present has 15 cases Thailand has twice as many China GP would have been 2 weeks later than Hanoi if there was a concern then they would be looking at Hanoi now. As long as current restrictions on travel remain in place in Vietnam there is a good chance the numbers will not increase by much. If other places in the area are not of concern, as many have a higher number of cases, don't see it a problem as of now..."
"Hello, I read it on the Guardian.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/1…I also have flights and tickets from the UK, I like you all are monitoring the situation......"
"Looking good to go.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/51486367The Vietnam Grand Prix is expected to go ahead on 5 April despite concerns over the coronavirus, says Formula 1's managing director Ross Brawn."

"Hi Guys,I’m a solo traveller from the UK, so would be good to catch up with other F1 fans travelling by themselves.I haven’t booked any accommodation yet, but although the Old Quarter isn’t the best location for the track I’m thinking that would be the best option.... Any thoughts on if this or better alternatives for the racing/social combo?"
"Hi Steve,There's a couple of other messages in this post asking similar things. I'm solo too and staying at the Spring Hotel Hanoi (now fully booked) which I chose as it's within 45 mins walk of the track. There were some comments about public transport not being great and particularly on the Sunday the roads could be VERY busy so I decided to stay as close as possible/practical.Your other issue will be availability now. I'd get booked ASAP."
"I've taken a different approach to Simon....yes our trip is primarily about the GP (for the first few days at least) but it's a new city for us, and having explored options closer to the circuit, we've decided to stay in the Old Town as it looks a whole lot more interesting. Transport to and from the circuit won't be as easy as it might be, but I've spoken to our hotel and they have assured me that they will arrange a driver to get us there for each of the three days (I'm less concerned about getting 'home' each day...taxi or Grab will be my first ports of call, but on Sunday in particular I am guessing that walking away from the circuit for 30 mins or so and making a plan from there will be best). It's all down to personal choice really."
"We are staying in the Old quarter as well, reserved a room at Hanoi Amanda hotel. We only have tickets for the Friday, however still undecided to go or not now."

For sure. It's definately contained. Only 16 cases and no new cases in about 5 days
Anyone else getting more worried as time goes on?! With so many other events being cancelled and so little news from Vietnam GP (I’ve not had a reply to an email in two weeks!)
"My family will be canceling our trip today. We’ve been agonizing over this decision since the end of January and have finally made the decision to pull the plug. Our VN tour operator was kind enough to allow us to postpone our trip through the end of this year without any additional fees. Although we will have to pay a $200/ticket to cancel our air Through Expedia, we felt as if this was a reasonable concession.Edited: 1:50 pm, February 26, 2020 "
"Vietnam has had 16 cases all of whom are now reported as recovered, there have not been any new cases reported since 13 Feb that's 2 weeks ago. As long as sensible measures are in place to reduce the risk of people entering the country from hot spots then no reason for it not to go ahead. Still going..."
Such a shame but it’s where I’m leaning towards too. It’s not the fear of catching anything that worries me it’s something going wrong and ending up being quarantined somewhere dodgy!
"I've cancelled today Australian government is saying anyone with a temperature coming home will be quarantined, Even if it isn't the corona virus, Just don't think it's worth it will go next year"
"I am so sorry Vietnam.Please keep my fascination and passion for the sport F1 in live for the future races. All the joy, all the fun being together fellow F1 fans have been hit by the virus in the world.It will not be easy to make big enthusiasm noise in the spectator sections. Enjoying a beer and a Johnnie Walker with a mask on. How do the wonderful Dutch supporters make their party?I want to get my mandatory autograph, be close and talk to my F1 idols. They must not be, so to say isolated. I fear to look them in “pope car scenery” in the fan zones. All my setup is ready. Ticket, flight, hotel, transport but the most important my heart is not in the suitcase yet. I must feel deep in my stomach to make my final decision. To F1 and Liberty, do not make the money choose stupid this time. If necessary, keep my ticket and we will fight the virus with the correct medicine.Love to F1 and all the fans. Thank you.Some of my search sites to find credible information. Do you have some input where to google? https://www.gpblog.com/en/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-motor-f1-…https://vietnam.travel/things-to-do/informat…https://www.rtl.de/cms/daniel-ricciardo-man-…"
grrr I'm so torn :(
"As of today the UK has the same number of cases 16. so is the risk in the UK higher than Vietnam ? Well I would say yes. Latest case this morning, last case in Vietnam 13 Feb and as said ALL there 16 cases are now recovered, the UK has new live cases."
Japan has shut every school in the country for a month!
"Hi ElansearTo say that Vietnam (or any country) is safer than the UK based on numbers of known, current or new cases is incorrect. You have to take into account the risks involved in travelling to the region too - far more risks travelling than sitting at home in the UK That said, I believe the risks to be very low when you compare statistics for the common flu in UK during 2019 as follows:Cases reported to doctors: 9646Number of people hospitalised: 586Deaths: 23 Caveat: various data sources have slightest different figures but this gives a reasonable comparison"
Completely missing the point nigel224 :(
"Received my tickets today,No change to my plans,would be gutted if the race was cancelled,only way i wont be going is if the UK advised against travel."
"Yep, much as I try to keep a sense of proportion and to both attend the race and enjoy Vietnam in ~4 weeks time, Nigel224 your post really does not consider what for most people on this thread is the big concern - spending 10hrs+ (twice!) in a pressurised metal tube in close proximity to ~300 other people!"
Please feel free to join my WhatsApp Group and participate in some interesting chats That are on-going..I’m sure that there will be some very useful information once people start arriving in Hanoi in a few weeks time (me included) Numbers to : f1forum@gmx.com for privacy.
The organisers themselves on social media seem very certain it's going to go ahead as planned.
"I haven't seen what the organisers have been saying, and very much want the race to go ahead if, and only of, circumstances sensibly permit. I just don't see how, with such an uncertain and rapidly changing situation, any credible claims can be made about what will, and what will not, happen in 4 weeks time!"
I guess they have to make a judgement call. Cancelling four weeks out for example would cause a huge amount less hassle/cost/etc than cancelling the week before.
"They do, but in the case of Vietnam, I can see the call to cancel, if it comes, being ~1 week out. The situation is nowhere near as clear cut as it was for the Chinese GP, and based on what I can read about the situation in Vietnam at the moment, I can see no need to cancel. However, events may change, as they have, for example, in Europe over the last week. Health concerns should come first and big events (like the Geneva Motor Show) can be cancelled at the last moment."
"On another negative subject...Anybody have tickets in the not to be built part of the grandstand at turn 1?I'm lucky as I've got my allocated seats at turn 2-3-4, but a couple of friends have fallen foul of this and got the email over the weekend so have to choose different seats..."
We have tickets in the turn 1 grandstand...but no email (yet!)Do you know if the whole of this stand is not to be built or just sections?
"Yup. Tickets arrived today, start grid grandstand, all good, seats allocated..."
Ditto!
"Yay, grandstand tickets arrived today.Here's hoping it goes ahead!Earlier there was lots of discussion with regards hotels near the track - are most people staying out near My Dinh or more centrally in the Old Quarter? I'm in the Crowne Plaza next to the track (mainly through luck and early booking - the prices once the dates were confirmed were ridiculous) anyone else up that way?"
Yep I’m nearby too - about 40mins walk IIRC. Your hotel looks brilliant though!
Do we know if there's anything out next to the track like a Fan Zone or somewhere to grab a beer with other fans? (I don't have high hopes for the Saturday night entertainment!)
I see people saying their tickets have arrived we haven’t had ours even. Is an email sent advising when they might arrive? TIA
It might depend who you purchased the tickets through - I got an email from DHL with tracking info the day before I got anything from the F1 Ticket store.
">>We have tickets in the turn 1 grandstand...but no email (yet!)Do you know if the whole of this stand is not to be built or just sections?<<It's only part of the stand not built.In the second picture, there's what looks like a carpark next to the already built stand at turn 1.https:/…hanoi-circuit-track-completed-p205As we all bought tickets when they first came out we were auto allocated and looks like my friends in that stand were auto allocated a not to be built stand!If you check your account you should be allocated seat numbers."
"Thanks for your response Klopptastic. We booked our tickets through the official event, local, website. This permitted us to allocate specific seats rather than risk the lottery of auto-allocation. Based on your warning I have a/ checked that our tickets are still showing on our online account (they are!) and b/ looked to see that it is possible to still make a booking in 'our' stand (it is!!). So hopefully all is well!Out tickets are to be delivered electronically - still no sign yet."
Our tickets are with DHL being delivered today. !!Now just praying flights agents disrupted
"From messages posted on various forums, including this one, it seems clear to me that those who purchased through vendors issuing physical tickets are in the process of having these delivered.Those who bought through the official local organiser and opted for e-tickets (so to be delivered via email) have not had their tickets issued yet."
My friend in Vietnam has bought e-tickets from the local agent have been told that it’ll be sent out in around 20th March.I told him to change it to physical ticket and will update this forum as soon as he gets it

Cause for cautious optimism?https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/51727401
Took the decision today to bail out of my trip :(Everyone needs to weigh it up for themselves but to me it was becoming more of a stress factor trying to read between the lines as to whether its safe and sensible or not to go. I had planned a 2 week holiday around the race and I just don't feel comfortable with it.Hope the rest of you enjoy the inaugural Grand Prix!Stay safe!
Right that's me out too now :(Just like David above the stress of trying to work out whether the race would go ahead and what quality of trip I would have just made it not enjoyable any more.I'm gutted but think this is the best decision based on advice at the moment.
"Do you guys get refunds or are to transfer the trip elsewhere if you do not intend to travel? We are advised that we will only get refund if government say don’t fly, but not booked a package deal.Jenny"
Hotels were pay on arrival. I get all but £150 back from flights. Airport parking was fully refunded. Will likely lose cost of ticket (unless the race gets cancelled)
"Assuming you haven't booked fully flex air travel / cancelable hotels, unless the UK Government issue a 'dont travel' notice it is unlikely your travel insurer will compensate you. No harm in speaking to them on the off chance though. Even without fully flex air tickets, taxes and duty are generally refundable (less an admin fee) and these charges make up a reasonable proportion of the cost of economy tickets. If the race does get cancelled, I'd fully expect tickets to be refunded.Edited: 8:38 am, March 04, 2020 "
"“ If the race does get cancelled, I'd fully expect tickets to be refunded.”This bit worries me. Like China it’s unlikely they’ll cancel the race but postpone it. Not sure how that leaves refunds."
The actual race is on the Sunday
"I have a friend who is apart of the f1 setup team, they have been advised by liberty that March 15th will be the day they have until to decide if it goes ahead, so I would say just wait till then don't cancel any trips or do anything as your better off waiting with travel insurnace etc, also they have advised locals with notices of closer of beer street in old quarter and large crowded area's, it will be a shame if alot of the places are closed,I've cancelled I just don't think it's worth it and not being able to enjoy the actual town and race if it's in lock down,Australia government are also quarantining anyone coming back from asia with a temperature even if it isn't corona virus,CheersEdited: 10:51 pm, March 05, 2020 "
There goes Bahrain :(https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/51789298Surely Vietnam has to do the same?
"The situation in Hanoi is fast-changing with all the new cases arriving into Noi Bai Airport from London.200 plus people on that plane had traveled through Hanoi, with 60 of them still in the city.https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.thanhnien.vn/…Lots of movement around; there's no telling how many may develop symptons in the coming days.The good news is that all passengers tested positive for Covid-19 are reported to be in stable conditions, at least for now.John"
"Hi, see the following link below.Hanoi may follow Bahrain with no spectators for the GP!https://vietnamtimes.org.vn/f1-vietnam-grand…"
I assume we are then refunded the ticket price? When will they make the final decision?
"It looks like a final decision will be made by 11th March.......From the article:""On March 11, F1 chairman will come to Hanoi to assess the situation for the last time to see if it should be postponed, or take place behind closed doors."""
"I'd like to see a third option there, at least for consideration....i.e. go ahead as planned!Just to show this option isn't considered completely bonkers by some people:https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/51789298Edited: 7:36 am, March 09, 2020 "
"At this rate, I feel that it is best if F1 just postpone or make the race for participants only like the Bahrain race. So many people who are coming from all over the country are going to have a hard time entering Vietnam - logistically it just sounds like a total nightmare."
The amount of people that walk the streets of Vietnam anyway. I

I guess in a few days we will know one way or another what is going to happen. It is understandable though that there are genuine concerns amongst the Vietnamese government and the local population regarding have hundreds of flights with tens of thousands of “foreigners” arriving for a 3 day event from countries that in the main have more cases of “the virus” that Hanoi - and then leaving !!Thugs are changing by the day so sooner or later a decision will be made.

It’s very disappointing that this Corona virus occurred at this time and is causing so much disruption to the F1. I do hope that the airlines will be sympathetic to travellers regarding refunds or rebooking etc. I hope at least that the Australian GP goes ahead despite McLaren pulling out. Cheers.
"""....and is causing so much disruption to the F1.""In the whole scheme of things, who really cares?Seriously. Scott"
Aussie GP has gone nowhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/51849163Very hard to see the Vietnam race going ahead.
As Vietnam Airlines put my flight out back a day I got a full refund! Just need the race to get cancelled now and I'll have got all my money back. Definitely want to try again for 2021.

"""Ermmm scottj765 we’re talking about the Vietnam GP here mate!""Ermmm, not everyone, mate. ;-)Scott"
Well it’s a thread called “Vietnam Grand Prix” in the Hanoi forum - I can see how you’d be confused ;)
No Vietnam GP...
"scottj765, WTF is the matter with you?This is a thread about the Vietnam GP (the clue is in the title! So naturally (most!) people reading and contributing have some interest in F1/this race in particular.Clearly you have no interest in either, which is of course fine, but this being the case I seriously struggle to understand why you feel the need to keep popping up with snide and unhelpful comments!You clearly have way, way to much time on your hands!"
"Well I'm glad the decision has been made and we can all move on now!I'm gutted but it was inevitable and I was never going to enjoy a visit to Vietnam whilst this pandemic is ongoing.Fortunately I've got all my money back from flights, hotels, etc and should get a full refund of F1 tickets too so here's to trying again in 2021!"
"Pleased to hear you have got all of your travel / accomodation costs back Simon. The situation with the tickets actually remains uncertain. Some media outlets are reporting that the race is 'cancelled' (refund would be no problem) others 'postponed'. If the race is postponed we are not due a refund, but access to the rearranged race."
"@WhyoneThe postponed/cancelled thing is really down to FIA rules. I read something about it when China was 'postponed' - something along the lines of if a race is cancelled they get their fee refunded or something but.In reality the race is cancelled. There's no way they're going to be able to reschedule this season.I'm fairly certain in the coming days the organisers will offer everyone a transfer to 2021 or a full refund. If they don't then assuming you've paid on credit or debit card, a quick phone call to their dispute team will get you your money back that way."
"I read about the possibility of the FIA pushing Abu Dhabi into mid December and running China and Vietnam in the weeks immediately before....all rumour and conjecture at this stage obviously, but there are so many possibilities it's impossible to call."
"So race postponed:""In an official statement, the race promoter said: “The Vietnam Grand Prix Limited Liability Company (VGPC) regrets to announce the postponement of the Formula 1 VinFast Vietnam Grand Prix 2020 as scheduled.“The decision to postpone comes after extensive consideration of the ongoing and developing coronavirus situation as well as after the recent [World Health Organization] declaration of the outbreak as a global pandemic, and follows guidance from all relevant authorities whose collective concern is the health and well-being of the Vietnamese people as well as travelling Formula 1 fans, staff and championship participants.”No new date has been set yet for either the Bahrain or Vietnam GPs.“This has been a very difficult decision to reach, especially as preparations for Hanoi to join the world’s most prestigious sporting event with a world-class, state-of-the-art Formula 1 circuit had just entered their final stages,” the statement continued.“VGPC will continue to work closely with Formula 1, the FIA, the Hanoi People’s Committee and the VMA to monitor the situation and will look to announce an alternative date and provide a further update for our ticket purchasers, sponsors and partners in due course""Edited: 4:37 pm, March 13, 2020 "

grrrr organisers not being helpful re refunds. Flat out refused my request today saying they'll look at it again when the new date is organised. I'm sorry but I want my money back now not in six months time.Looks like I'll have to go through the credit card company.
Should have been enjoying the F1 right now at the end of an awesome two week trip to Vietnam :(Fingers crossed for 2021.

Yep looking forward to that tonight!
"So, what's everyone doing about refunds? I bought my ticket from the official f1.com website and they're just fobbing me off with 'we'll see what the new dates are and think about it then'. It doesn't matter what date they rearrange it to - I can't go. Has anyone claimed back on their credit card or are you just waiting? Thanks"
Little option but to wait. I'm pretty sure your credit card issuer won't want to know.
Received full refund (minus £17 postage) a few days ago but took lots of emails :( Keep trying!
"Was that from F1 Tickets simontaH3bR?Is there a magic word/phrase I need to be using?Or do I just need to annoy the crap out of them hahaEdited: 1:56 pm, April 28, 2020 "
No I bought direct from f1vietnamgp.comDon't be fobbed off. You're entitled to a full refund. You can also speak to your bank/credit card company to raise a dispute and do it that way.
I would lodge a charge back claim with your card issuer if you feel they are not responding. There has been no service provided so they are obliged to credit.Cheers Ross
