"President Sanchez ordered the State of Alarm yesterday. It starts on Monday, March 16, and ends on March 30.https://english.elpais.com/politics/2020-03-…This means that restaurants will be closed. Tourists could go to hotel restaurants, which will be open."
"As ordered by the decree of the State of Alarm, hotel bars and restaurants are closed except to cater their guests."
"More misinformation ...... good for you Revulgo for correcting, otherwise, I suspect, that people could potentially have been subject to fines for breaching the restrictions by heading out to these places."
Agreed. Hotel restaurants are for residents only. Please Benny don’t give people advice that is totally wrong. You have given this misleading on other forums . Please stop.

I just saw on my local Toronto news that Spain has lifted the mandatory lockdown for children. Truth?
"Its a possibility from April 27thhttps://english.elpais.com/society/2020-04-1…Edited: 3:13 am, April 19, 2020 "
Sanchez said he hoped it would be possible that young children could be permitted to go out to exercise from April 27th. The exact details haven’t been published yet.
"Not sure what madrileños feel about the suggestion that it is only children aged 12 and under who are to be allowed out with their main carer for 30 minutes (if this is true). There is absolute outrage in our paper’s online comments this morning. Mums and dads are asking how they explain to their 13 year old child that they cannot go out, when their younger sibling can. Fair point!"
"The vast majority of spanish residents and their expat communities deserve a lot of credit for enduring such a strict lockdown (despite a sizable amount of fines being issued for those infringing it)particulary those with families, who i would have thought deserved being thrown a bigger bone after six weeks confinement.Spain faces a rocky road forward with an already fractured political system.Atb steveEdited: 7:07 am, April 19, 2020 "
"Mandatory lockdown has not been lifted for children. As Qualityspy explained, there has been a relaxation in restrictions to allow children out to exercise, but even this will come with some rules. Full details as to how this will work are yet to be provided. I can’t say that I am ‘outraged’ as a resident of Madrid at the prospect of younger children being allowed out, as I get how difficult it must be for parents of younger children living in city apartments, often without even a balcony. Younger children often find it difficult to grasp the circumstances, and as they have shorter attention spans, so parents do need to find inventive ways of keeping them entertained, which can be exhausting. That said, I have not heard anything about any age specific criteria yet. There is little point getting outraged, we just need to go with the flow, and we’ll all be allowed out at some point hopefully in the not too distant future. The strict measures imposed so far are a small price to pay if lives are saved, rates of infection drop, and this virus is contained. However, the longer this continues, the more the likelihood of even more lives being lost due to economic and other consequences. The politicians have some very fine balancing to do and some difficult choices ahead. It is not just Spain which faces a rocky road ahead, other countries, UK and US included all face difficult times. It is certainly one hell of a bad start to a new decade world over!Edited: 10:14 am, April 19, 2020 "
"Hello livvy, yes many countries face a struggle moving forward, though spain already had political instability before this, with regards to multiple elections just to form a workable congress, catalonian unrest ect, it will be much harder for spain than say the uk to arrive at concensus and unity of direction given the fractured political situation.Atb steve"
"Steve, agreed, I think it remains to be seen if the tenuous coalition even survives after all of this. Who knows. There is no question that Spain has big issues to face, but so too will many countries - testing times for all. The UK faces the additional challenge of concluding Brexit negotiations, and the US has elections, all of which add to the economic consequences. I don’t think any one country can be singled out, each has their own issues to deal with on top of all of this. Equally, the spotlight will no doubt be put on how the EU handled this crisis, particularly in respect of Italy and Spain. Attentions need to focus on the task in hand just now, but I have no doubt that the fallout during aftermath will be huge world over. We will know normality has resumed when the ‘how much spending money’ and ‘How do I get to my hotel from the airport’ questions return!"
"Gracias LivvyMad- Bien dicho!! Well-said. Stay safe and healthyEdited: 11:29 am, April 19, 2020 "
"LivvyMad- thank you! Although new to the Madrid Forum, I am a great fan of your wonderful city having lived and studied there in my Youth. Our plan was to come back in October to re visit places like the Prado and Retiro Park. Also to visit places new for us like Reina Sofia Museum. Of course I would need to pass by the areas where I lived-c/Isaac Peral, C/Bravo Murillo and c/Pizarro. Ah....tantas memorias. I long to walk along the Gran Via and stop for a cold drink- horchata would work. And every trip I played the Tourist and went to Plaza de Espana for my photo of the statue of Don Quijote and Sancho Panza. I receive ‘Hola’ magazine weekly for many years( like our People magazine) and am a fan of some of your shows like ‘Velvet’ & ‘Velvet Collection’ and ‘Gran Hotel’. Though light and fluffy, these shows allow me to hear ‘castellano’ and maintain my Spanish. Call this e Mail the ramblings of an older woman who dated back to the days of ‘Sereno’- yes, I am old!! One common theme is all on this Forum wish Madrid to ‘heal’ and get back to normal, although there will most likely be a ‘new normal’ Nos vemos"
"NewYorklena: You have wonderful memories of the city, let us hope you can return soon to add to them!"
"NewYorklena,I have faith that this crisis won't devastate the traditional shops that had managed to survive for decades and hope that you can soon visit ""Manolo"", which is open since 1934, and located in C / Princesa, very close to Isaac Peral.http://manolorestaurante.com/"
Revulgo- gracias for the recommendation of ‘Manolo’. My piso was at Isaac Peral near Cea Bermudez and San Francisco de Sales. I walked many times towards Princesa and may have actually passed Manolo. We will be sure to try it when we are able to travel again to Madrid. Perhaps you will meet us for una copa? Salud
Are there any timelines/baselines/phases for the re-opening of Spain?
"Yes, we are currently working through various phases of the lifting of restrictions. This is being done on a regional basis. Madrid, for example, will remain on phase 1 for at least another week, whilst other regions have progressed to phase 1. We hope to return to a new normality by summer if the rate of infection does not rise again. There is no clear indication as yet, about when borders will reopen and international tourism will resume."
"Hopefully this link helps to show which places have progressed to the first phase of de-escalation. If all goes according to plan, then most places will be back to some semblance of normality by the end of June.https:/…2013477.shtmlSorry the article is in Spanish, but if you have a web browser with a translate option, it should help explain."
"Excellent article, glad to see the number of new cases are going down significantly, and that there is a reasonable plan to reopen. The graphic should be enough to let even those who don't read Spanish to understand the phases.I'm sure there are naysayers there as there are here, but it's better to be safe than sorry."
David: The rates have remained pretty stable over the last 7 days. The Spanish Government has announced that all international travellers will have to have a 14 day period of quarantine upon entry to Spain for as long as the state of emergency exists. The quarantine comes into effect on Friday 15 May.
Here is the information in English posted by the U.S. Embassy. Be safe everyone!https:/…
"Interesting link Elaine, leading to a further link which has the list of emergency tourist accomodation https://boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php…"
"Livvy, the state I live in also has a 14 day quarantine period for visitors, but it's hard to enforce. It's going to be a difficult summer for Maine, as it effectively ends tourism, which is a large part of our state's income, for the foreseeable future; but it's necessary. Things are starting to open back up here, and I'm hoping it doesn't lead to a spike."

"Spain’s State of Alarm ends on June 21, what will change?https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-06-2…"
"European borders are reopening, but there is a lot of small print to digest.Citizens from the United Kingdom, which has officially left the EU but is still covered by a transition agreement until December that grants it full rights as a member state, can enter Spain. But anyone taking the opposite journey will have to quarantine for two weeks on arrival in the UK, a measure that will be in place at least until June 29, despite Spain having opted not to impose a reciprocal measure on UK arrivals.Denmark will keep border controls in place for the majority of its fellow members – including Spain – until June 27.The rules for non-EU and non-Schengen countries are yet to be defined at all. Spain is counting on the 27-member bloc to agree on a list of safe countries, with scaled entry dates according to the epidemiological situation in each one.Washington is still vetoing the entrance of Europeans on American soil, which is prompting the EU to respond in kind.https://english.elpais.com/spanish_news/2020…"
