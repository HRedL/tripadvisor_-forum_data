"I would highly suggest not booking any flights with ExploreTrip. Last week I purchased a flight home to Australia through them and received an email saying your flight is booked, this is not your e-ticket, please wait 4 hours to receive your e-ticket email.After 6 hours I emailed them saying I hadn't received my e-ticket then called them and spoke to customer service who assured me my ticket was booked and to just wait for the e-ticket email.After two more days I emailed them again and sent a picture of my confirmation and received this generic response...Dear Customer,Please accept our sincere apologies, but unfortunately the reservation you made was notconfirmed. As mentioned on our website the price and availability of our low fares can changequickly and cannot be guaranteed until the ticket is issued.In this case, the airline canceled the available seat before your card was charged because it wasbooked by someone else. We tried to re-book the ticket at the same price for the sameitinerary but were not successful. We regret the inconvenience caused and wanted to let youknow your credit card was not charged. We hope that you’re able to find another fare onExploreTrip that meets your travel requirements.We are committed to serve you in the best possible way, 24/7, Regards,To which I replied...Excuse me? I got an email from your company saying my trip was booked. It's been two whole days since then and now you are telling me my flights are not booked. This is absolutely not acceptable. Flights have most definitely gone up in price now plus I have already organized with people to pick me up on that day. What is your company willing to do to resolve this problem because sending me an email apologizing for your mistake is certainly not enough when I am now without a flight. I hope to hear from you soon to resolve this.Thank you.Dane BergmanIt has now been 3 days since that last email and I have not received any response from them.As someone who spends thousands of dollars each year on flights and travel I will not be dealing with explore trip ever again as their customer service and capabilities are horrible. I SUGGEST YOU DO THE SAME!"
"You won't hear back from Exploretrip, and they won't (and can't ) get you a ticket at a price that doesn't exist. This is just one of many reasons why the regulars on this forum advise booking direct with the airline, which is what you should be doing now."
"This is fairly typical for 3rd party agents, which do not have live prices.What a client does, is submit a ""request"" for a ticket, at a price shown, which might not have existed for months, if at all.I do not know this agent, but suspect that most do almost the same thing.Stories abound here, about getting to an airport, to find that XYZ never purchased one.Good luck,Hunt"
Terrible service. I just booked the tickets and got the same email from them which ask me to wait for the confirmation. Now I am afraid to get the same story with you. Sorry to hear your bad experience. Have a good day!
"I also have had a horrible experience with Explore Trip a.k.a. Trip Pro. Alaska Airlines canceled my flight and booked me on a flight I could not make. I only found out about the change by accident. When I contacted Alaska they said I could cancel for a FULL REFUND since the change was so drastic (4 hours earler) But when I decided to cancel Alaska said I had to contact the third party I booked through. Alaska referred to them as Trip Pro, even though their website states ""explore trip"". When I called Explore trip the first person I spoke with said yes I was entitled to a full refund...minus non-refundable ""taxes"" of $125/ticket, but wait...only $75/ticket when I argued that Alaska said I was due a full refund he said you are getting a full refund...with a fee imposed. Now the fee was $45. The call was ""dropped"" I called back. Spoke to a second person. He argued he would have to call Alaska to get a code. (I was already told by Alaska the code for a full refund had been added to my file.) While he called Alaska, I called them as well, for the third time on this (4th call to Alaska all together) and was again told I was entitled to a full refund and that had been noted in my file.Explore trip called me back after an hour stated he had been on the phone with Alaska that entire time and I was entitled to all but $50/ticket. I argued with him that while he was on the phone with Alaska so was I and they had again stated I was entitled to a full refund. I have filed a complaint with my state department of consumer protection and will be filing a dispute with the credit card company.I have since learned that the prices I received from Explore Trip are the same prices I can get on my own direct from the airline. NEVER USE SKIPLAGGED OR EXPLORE TRIP/TRIP PRO TO BOOK YOUR TICKETS!!"
"Yikes! Such horrible experiences! I booked a flight with them yesterday and just now stumbled upon this thread. I so far have only been charged once, and have received a confirmation number and was able to confirm my reservation with the airline. My trip isn’t for another month but I am *hoping* these are good signs that I might luck out with this horrible company. Thoughts??? Also, I will continue to check on my reservation directly with the airline but is there anything else I should be doing to ensure a scam doesn’t happen??"
"Laurie,They are not scammers, just a very poor operator who cuts corners. So long as you continue to monitor the airline website using the 'Check my flight' or something similar, and watch closely if the flight times might get changed by the airline, which sometimes the third parties do not advise the punters of, you should be OK."
"I have an update. The situation not resolved yet but I've made progress. After I contacted my State Department of consumer protection I heard back from both skiplagged and explore trip. Now explore trip is willing to work with me. I will update further, when I receive my full refund. They now stated I am entitled to a full refund with no stipulations. I still stand by my statement to book direct with the airlines. I will do that from now on."
EXPLORE TRIP ARE THIEVES!!!!!!! Don t book with them: as soon as they got your money they cancel your flight without contacting you!
"Yes, me too. I happened to check the United Airlines site only to find a message that my confirmed and ticketed flight had been cancelled by ExploreTrip for no reason. This despite the fact that the payment has already come through on my Visa statement as a charge from United Airlines so I know the charge went through ok. The ExploreTrip rep couldn't explain why they had cancelled my itinerary or why they hadn't made any attempt by phone, email, or paper mail to contact me. After an hour on hold waiting for a ""supervisor"", he came back on to say I should just email escalationsATexploretrip.com and I'd hear back within 2 hours. But, I've received no call and no email reply. Complete scam, I'm totally screwed."
"'I happened to check the United Airlines site only to find a message that my confirmed and ticketed flight had been cancelled by ExploreTrip for no reason. This despite the fact that the payment has already come through on my Visa statement as a charge from United Airlines so I know the charge went through ok.'In this case did you call United to enquire about the booking, and did you call your credit card provider to ensure payment had been taken rather than a hold placed? 'The ExploreTrip rep couldn't explain why they had cancelled my itinerary or why they hadn't made any attempt by phone, email, or paper mail to contact me. After an hour on hold waiting for a ""supervisor"", he came back on to say I should just email escalationsATexploretrip.com and I'd hear back within 2 hours. But, I've received no call and no email reply. Complete scam,'It's not a scam, and no I have nothing to do with this poor excuse of a third party booking site. If you've not clarified the status with the airline or with your credit card provider then call both of them before spending another second dealing with the inept operations at exploretrip.com.If payment was taken but there is no booking at the airline website, lodge a dispute. If there is a booking then keep an eye on it at the UA website as exploretrip.com isn't likely to send any information about any changes in that booking although it's what a reputable agent would do."
"Thought my post was clear, payment was taken and tickets were issued then ExploreTrip went out of their way to cancel the tickets without cause or communication. Their own rep has no idea why it was done and the ""supervisor"" won't reply or answer their phone.Edited: 2 years ago "
The ticket flogger will lie like a pig in poo to avoid telling you the true situation.
"Contact your state department of consumer protection. Contact your credit card company. Neither of these will help with your flights, but will help getting your funds returned. Also, contact the search engine you went through to book this. When I ended up at explore trip I had searched for my flights through SK*******D.com I have received some help from them as well. (I don't want to post their full name in case you booked through someone else.) I also received a refund of the fees charged by the search engine as well. Even if you have already received you funds back I would still contact the department of consumer protection. The complaint will be an official record. Try to include any documentation you received from explore trip."
"Hi everybody,Last Saturday 20th.2018 I booked a flight JFK Shanghai for two people, I received a mail about the confirmation and to wait for the real e-tickets. I do also receive a mail from my bank telling me the purchase has been done. After two days (now) I havent received anything from them, so I replied by mail asking for the real e-tickets or airline confirmation number o whatever to be relaxed.My flight is for final days of april and I am worried about the money I spent on ExploreTrip. If anybody can give some clues about how to act in order to receive my tickets or the money, I would appreciate it.Rgrds and many thanks in advance."
Sign in to the airlines website. Use the confirmation code you received in the email. If you have tickets in your name they should show up on the airlines website.
"Hi Sandy, all.I received some mails from ET explaining that my reservation was booked successfuly. They also sent me a code (six letters) to log in the airline and proceed with the chek-in. AirChina onky admits NUMBERS! So, I call to this airline customer service, and asked me for the reservation number, I porvided them the Six Letter I received from ET. They said my reservations is confirmed, they also said the passenger names and asked me which seats i would like to have for the trip NYC- Shanghai. But they mentioned for the returning flight (Shanghai-NYC) I have to call them again 3 days previous in order to select the seats.I was happy for hearing these good news from the airline, and I asked to the assisstant why I can not choose the seats by myself, and they replied because you used a third-party compaty to make the reservation.I realized the prices for my flight changed/raised in these two days, and ET does not appear in the search engine I used.At the beginning I was concerned about this situation, I went to the bank and they help me for a procedure if ET does not confirm the reservation. But when I heard the news from the airline I was relief. I also realized that ET expects you cancel the flight so they will get a fee from you, and will make you waste your time and patience.NEXT time I will make my reservation with the airline. No more Explore Trip. That´s for sure!!!"
"Yikes! Sorry to hear about all the bad experiences. I had booked a round-trip flight from LAX - SIN (Singapore) last October, and also received that weird email saying my e-ticket would be mailed separately. There was nothing, and eventually I checked the United website using the confirmation number they'd given me and was relieved to find my tickets were indeed confirmed and available. I'm tempted to use them again since I did have a positive experience, but am reluctant because it seems hit-or-miss."
"I confirm: I received a Flight Confirmation email, mentionning ""Congratulations, your flight has been booked!"" and ""Paid""I didn't receive additional new. Finally, I called them. My 2 first calls were cut; and the last one the person told me that the paiement was declined by my credit card for fraud! They never contacted me in order to see what is the problem, given that it is usual in some countries that, for security reasons, you have to call your bank to unblock the paiement. However, the website of the company or the company has to inform you. Their customer service doesn't know this; so there is nothing to do with fraud!It is not acceptable!Explore the trip is the worst company I have never had to deal with it, supposing that we can call it a company.shame on them!They have to learn their business"
Its a terrible way to book your travel. Charged $75 for changing an unconfirmed flight and received an email after 24 hours saying your travel couldn't be booked as airline gave away to tickets to somebody else. Ended having to book the same flights somewhere else spending a couple hundreds more because i wasted a couple of days on Exploretrip.
This is a absolute fraud company run from India...Stay Away folks absolutely astay away...when I purchased tickets I got email saying transaction denied...thus I purchased tickets directly from airline...later without my authorization exploretrip rechanged my credit card without my authorization...Kindly stay off this fraud company absolutely
"This company is a total scam. I ordered my ticket online and they charged my visa, however, after an hour of waiting I never got my eticket emailed. I called them to see what was happening and when I could expect my ticket and Amandalyn said that they actually couldn't confirm my ticket and that they never charged my card. I spent an hour arguing with the lady trying to explain to her that in fact money was pulled from my visa and I didn't have it available anymore. She told me to contact my bank and that their company has nothing to do with it. After I insisted I talk to the manager she decided to offer me an option where she would do the transaction for me with the money they already pulled (all of a sudden she admitted to the money being pulled) - this was supposed to be a guaranteed ticket booking considering she stated that booking online was unreliable. After 5 minutes she said that the price of the ticket increased and that I had to pay an additional $200 on top of the $1078 in order for her to confirm my ticket. Considering they had already pulled my money and my bank wouldn't be able to release my funds in the next 48hrs - I decided to pay the additional 200 to get my ticket booked and wrap this up. She had promised and guaranteed that within the next 40min I would receive my eticket on my email. I called them back in the morning (6 hours later) because I DID NOT get my eticket yet again.. and the story starts again. They apologize for the inconvenience (which doesn't help in any way) and their agency is not at fault, however, this time around the airline cancelled the ticket for that fee. No one emailed me, no one called me and of course they are not at fault for any of this. Absolutely ridiculous! I insisted I talk to their manager, and they told me they cant release his name and they dont have one supervisor who I can talk to. They kept telling me that the card was not charged AGAIN when the funds were clearly pulled (initial fee plus the additional difference). After spending 1.5h on the phone with this new agent he starts offering me the same nonsense that the previous agent did as well. They told me to pay another difference and that this time he was going to stay on the phone with me until I get my eticket. AT THIS POINT THIS IS STARTING TO SOUND LIKE A JOKE. Of course I denied that offer and requested I speak to their manager. Naturally they dont have a manager working, however, I was told that Patrick (their supervisor) was the only one that was there earlier. They directed me to his line (which was what I thought they did) and instead I was directed to a scheduling department who told me they couldn't help me in any way and they have no idea why I was directed to them . After I explained my situation he told me that Patrick or any of his colleagues won't be in until later in the day. The agent asked me for my complaint and states that Patrick will get back to me immediately once he gets to work to clear up this issue. Its been 12 hours since my last conversation with them..no one called back, no one picked up later, no funds have been released yet! I had to go to another agency to book my ticket for a more expensive price due to this whole scam! Please watch out!! They are so manipulative and unprofessional! This complaint wont end here.. I have already touched based with sky scanner to consider removing them from their affiliated companies due to all the negative reviews they've been getting!"
"NO DO NOT BOOK with them. they messed up my holidays. ask about all details u need to send a copy of your credit card via e mail AND your pass port copy AND a form, within 4 hours, in case u do not see that mail because u r workign or travelling !!!! they just cancel the flight and do not even let u know, they do not respond to your questions/e mails for days and then u finally cal them just to find ou tyour flight was cancelled and your holidays messed up. DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM!!!!!"

"Do not book with them! As with the others, I received an email saying the tickets had been booked, but the e-tickets would be mailed separately. I waited for 2 days and no tickets. Finally, I called them, and surprise! They said the airline had increased the price and they asked for $60 extra. They then sent me an email and asked me to reply to that email accepting the additional charge. Even if the airline did increase the price, they should have contacted me instead of the other way around. Poor customer service."
They are HORRIFIC. I just had the worst experience with them. Never ever book with ExploreTrip.
"BEWARE! WARNING! On February 2018 I also booked a flight through Explore Trip. I wish I would have read this forum prior to doing business with this company. Because as many have commented the experience booking through them had a bad turnout. When I contacted customer service, the rep was rude and not willing to help. My flight was completely booked and the only seats left were first class or business class. And I was to pay up for the difference. How can this be?. To make long story short I didn't receive any help. I instead called the airline hoping for a better customer service experience. The rep from the airline was much more helpful and willingly upgraded my seat to business at no additional charge. While explore trip not only failed to secure my flight after they confirmed! In addition, Explore Trip wanted me to incur the costs of their error and were only willing to ""help"" with 10 dollars off. As any traveler knows 10 dollars off is a laughable amount for a business or first class ticket feeEdited: 2 years ago "
I never heard of Explore Trips but have a charge on my charge card from them. I called my credit card company and they tried to google Explore trip and were lock out and could not open there sight. The card member said for sure this is a fraud. I called Explore trip and they gave me two different address for their business not the one on my statement. The girl was rude and asked for my phone number. I would only give her my area code which did not match what she had on file. Because of them I had to cancel my charge card and put in a fraud claim. This is a shim sham company if it really exists !
"Hi SandyPGravel , how did you contact the State department of Consumer protection. I am from Australia and I booked my tickets to LA with Exploretrip. My credit card was charged twice and one was refunded but I lost $165 AUD in the currency conversion. I should have read this post before booking with them. They are a fraud company."
"I'm not sure how to do that in Australia. My most successful tactic was going through my credit card company. I contacted my state department of consumer protection, thought it had helped, but several months later I received a letter stating they were unsuccessful in getting a response from Explore Trip. Letter said good luck, we can't help. Somehow the CC company was able to get the funds back."
You will not recover difference in conversion rates.
"They do not honor free cancellation within 24 hours as mandated by the Department of Transportation: https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov…They put deceptive messages on their website while booking (don't worry, you have 24 hours), but show hidden fee of $75 for cancellation in User Agreement."
That regulation applies to bookings with airlines in the SA. You did not book with an airline.
"Ishita, Frommy is absolutely right. The first sentence of the article you linked to actually refers to air carriers. There's no mention whatsoever of booking sites or travel agencies.If you want free 24 hour cancellation, you need to book directly with the airline."
"""in the SA"" should obviously have been 'in the USA""."
"Even with semi-bad experiences, I usually never take the time to leave a review, but I wanted to urge the rest of the population to NEVER use this site. You are better off buying your airline tickets directly from the site. I bought 2 flights across the country. One, from NC to OR and the second, from Oregon to Texas. I was excited as I booked them well in advance and had seemingly gotten a good deal for them. When I showed up at the airport for my trip, the people at the Alaskan Airlines counter told me that Explore Trip had sent my name to them, but none of my payment details. So, I needed to call Explore Trip to get that send or I couldn't get on the flight. I was standing at the airport sweating, on the phone immediately with the Explore Trip Hotline. It took 25 minutes for the Call Center to answer. Thank goodness I got there early. Their call center is located in India and the woman told me that they hadn't sent my payment details because the airline surged prices right at the moment I was buying them. So, they canceled the trip entirely. But, they hadn't told me this. The woman said they had, but I went into my emails and they hadn't sent me anything. I, of course, stressfully asked the woman on the phone what I should do. I was stranded at the airport and needed to get a flight. She started to yell at me and ask me why I had even shown up at the airport? She scolded me to tell me that prices now, on the spot, would be extremely expensive. HELLO? Of course, I knew that! All this to say, there was a huge language barrier, which ended in a lot of frustration. I ended up buying a ticket on my own accord, at the counter without the help of Explore Trip. I also had to rebook my second flight because the SAME thing had happened with that ticket as well. DONT USE THIS WEBSITE. If something goes wrong, you are DONE for. Oh, AND I called and emailed later to try to get some sort of credit, which was another difficult hurdle (and huge waste of time). They gave me a $50 reimbursement coupon. When I tried to use it, they said there would be a fee of $200 for using coupons. HOW DOES THAT make SENSE?!I'm an easy-going kind of person. And I let this all roll off my back and had a great trip anyway, but OMG I hope no one else has to go through what I went through!!"
"If I understand it correctly, you were never charged, but didn't realise that? Nor did you check your flights wiht the airline before going to the airport? Is that right?"
"Its true they have a really bad service, many of my friends have ended up in a lots of trouble.But I would pretty much recommend asaptickets.com they have provided me with great deals most of the time.They also have good customer service,and when i checked thier reviews, it was really good.So yeah I would pretty much recomend everyone to book from asaptickets."
Better idea is to book through the airlines directly!!! Avoid 3rd party booking sites.
"I just want to echo the negative reviews for exploretrip.com. I booked through them by mistake (in a hurry, googled United Airlines, didn't pay enough attention to the website address, assumed they were a contractor for United Airlines). I waited a few hours without receiving a ticket, then called them. They said the price for my ticket had gone up $100 and asked me to immediately confirm that I would pay that price. I said no, please cancel my booking. They said oh, we have a coupon, you can get it for only $50 more. I said no, please cancel. They said ""but it's the last available ticket for your flight"", which was b.s., I had already checked the United website and knew other tickets were available. I ultimately was able to cancel but now they have my credit card info, email address, etc. A true scam outfit, trying to make money without adding any value whatsoever."
"""A true scam outfit""Wrong - just a very poor one without live prices. A scam is where you do not get what you pay for. You would have got your ticket had you paid the increased fare so how can that be a scam?"
"""Bait and switch"" is a scam!"

"ebn, Tripadvisor does not permit duplicate posts, so please don't post the same thing in more than one thread."
"In December 2017 I bought an airfare for 613.79, but some days later I had to cancel it; they applied a penalty for $375 and gave me a credit for the difference to buy a new ticket under this conditions: for same passenger, same routing and same airline. If I don't use it trough December 2018 I lose it.So since April I am looking for an airfare in their website and several times I found flights to an specific price, and immediately call them to get a reservation, but unfortunately the employees of this business overprice the airfares when I mention my available credit. I feel like they have an advantage over me because they have my money. For example, yesterday I found a ticket for $628.06 and called them immediately but the agent told me ""the price is $998 but we can gave you a special discount so your final price is $850"". I told him ""but the price in your own website is 628.06. Why are you overpricing it by phone?"" and the agent ""let me ask my manager..."" after 15 min waiting he hanged up. I called them 3 more times and they did the same. Today, 24 hours later I am checking their website and the price keeps the same, in the same airline, same economy class and same routing. I think this is a robbery and a type of discrimination, If they don't want gave a refund or a credit they should be honest. This company has the worst customer service I ever used. I'd never use it again."
I was charged over $600 for a trip that was never booked. They won't explain it on the phone and direct me to an email address.Thieves is the only word for them.
"They could only have charged you if you had either given them your card details, or if your card had been cloned or hacked by criminals who then used it to buy a ticket.I suggest you contact your card provider asap if it's the latter."
Very unprofessional. They want me to pay extra do they can confirm my ticket. EXPLORE TRIP IS A SCAM!
"Couldn't agree more. Avoid them at all costs. They are crooks!When something goes wrong with your booking, and it invariably will. They will try to extort more money out of you to make the changes. And even worse than that, they will take 2, yes 2 months to refund your money. This is illegal in the state of California, per California legislature amended Section 17538 of the California Business and Professions Code. And hopefully the investigation i opened up will get behind what is really going on in this company.Avoid!"
Please keep us informed about the investigation. I'm very interested in the learning about results.
To everyone : Do not book with Explore trip - worst company ever ! I’ve been overcharged on my bill !
"I just spent several hours on the phone getting my daughter’s birth date corrected on a United ticket issued by Explore Trip. When they corrected her birth date, then changed her sex to male, which caused another call. It was actually easier to talk to someone tonight at Explore Trip than it was to reach United. Anyway, it appears that both got fixed. I’m glad that we discovered the errors this evining, rather than at the ticket counter. Despite getting tickets at a fair price on flights I could not see on line on other sites from Explore Trip, I wouldn’t use them again. There are shenanigans going on in the back room that are visible upon closer review of ticket receipts."
Same happened to me. Avoid booking with explore trip.
"I concur!! This is a horrible serviced company. After reading your advice, I continued to make my reservation but specifically asked for United confirmation after she gave me their bogus ""confirmation number"". She actually gave me one, so I thought wow, maybe this will work. But then never sent me a confirmation email with that UNited confirm #. Turns out that was completely false. After waiting 4 days, they came back and said my CC was declined, which is total BS. I just told to cancel, and I went directly to UA for good quick non-BS service.AVOID!!"
"The same thing happened to our family. We booked flights to Barcelona and they charged our card around 4K for the tickets. But they never actually purchased and seats with the funds. They also never notified us there was a problem or refunded any of the funds. They said it was ""our responsibility"" to contact them and confirm what the problem was. Unbelievable!! Never heard or experienced anything like this before.We ended up having to book the tickets ourselves directly with the airline at a much higher costs. DO NOT ever book with Exploretrip!! They are the most inefficient and worst booking sight we have ever experienced."
"Contact bbb I don’t know how they still have an a+, they are scammers!!! They had the nerve to call me 6 times at 655 am and then changed my seat selections without my authorization. Booked tickets, tried to cancel within 24 hours there was a 250 charge, fine never mind I'll keep the dates, mind you this was within 1 hour of purchasing (my bad didn't notice the midnight date change). I thought it was ridiculous... but then came the craziness. I get a call today, 3 days after I've purchased the tickets and I'm told that I need to pay $149 dollars extra to get seats. WHAT?! I'm traveling with twin 3-year-olds to Asia, a 13-hour flight. The man says that if I don't pay we won't sit together, in other words, I will have 2 toddlers sitting in between people. Obviously I call EVA and they try the best they can do because they obviously don't want 2 kids running around. My question is why didn't they inform me of this fee before?!!?! Ok so I'm on the phone with them again (exploretrip) and now they are telling me I need to pay only $100, but they can't guarantee my flight back will have seats together. I went online myself, didn't pay extra, and was able to get the seats assigned together for the leg out. I didn't tell the rep on the phone that yet, and he's really trying to charge me $100 for something I can do online by myself for free. He kept telling me to listen to him, and I asked him why, since he was lying to me. I asked if I pay the 100 if he can guarantee that we will sit together, and he says no, SO WHY WOULD I PAY!!!! I wish there was more I can do than file this complaint, they use some company called https://www.feefo.com for their complaints and so I'm going to be sending a complaint through that as well. Save your time, money and headaches, go to Vayma instead! And BBB why in the world is the company still an A when there are more complaints than anything else!!!"
Thanks for the inf.
The BBB is a useless archaic remnant of the 1960s.Buy directly from the airlines.
"A booking I made online used explore trip to process. Skiplagged. It was cheaper than all other outlets. The only irregularity of the transaction was something happened with their first booking, and they placed another booking. I reacted ""too fast"" and called them right away asking about that. But in the end, spoke with a pleasant person, and everything was perfectly fine. I keep notes on everything and if I had any hint of issues, it would be in my notes. (electronic, easily searchable) and there are no entries on this transaction. I also see where they requested feedback, via FEEFO. Based on my only one experience with them, I have no issues."
"We had the exact same experience, though they told us later the same day that our flight had not been booked because our credit card had been declined. then they tried to sell us two different fares that were far more expensive, despite there bing fares listed at much lower on their site (and elsewhere). In the end, they were able to process our card no problem and we got the initial fares we'd booked, but it was an absolute disaster. Scam artists for sure."
"Oh yes, I agree, DO NOT BOOK WITH EXPLORE TRIP. Thier business practices are shady and scam like. I had the same experience with booking and recieving a call afterwards saying it didn’t get booked coz the price went up and the airline cannot give it at the quoted price. Long story short, they want more money. And once they see you book for the same flights elsewhere, they put thru the charge from thier company anyway. And tell you that your ticket is valid. Of course its valid, we got it elsewhere! Its truly a scam. Buyer beware!"
"""once they see you book for the same flights elsewhere""That would be a neat trick! Any idea how they can do that?"
This happened to me and I am dealing with it now.
"Lesson learned. I will not use explore trip again. I will pay the extra with the airline or a reputable travel agency.Booked explore trip through skyscanner for trip Ottawa to Bosnia and Athens to Ottawa.There was no issue with emails being sent promptly. The problem rose when they called me to book seats. The call centre people I spoke with speak and write in broken english and are very impatientI booked my seats for three flights there and back and paid explore trip.When we checked in, Luftansa had NO record of these seats being booked. My husband and I were jammed into middle row seats. Explore trip did reply quickly with my email complaint to them and I received an email that I would be credited for the seats. This still has not happened. I was able to book seats direct with Luftansa and pay for them while away to ensure we had seats we prefer on the way back."
"It is basically a very poor service I won't ever try again. I wasted time booking a flight for $572 only to get a disturbing phone calls from the agents a few hours later well past midnight that the price had gone up by additional $300 due to ""airline's technical concern""! and that my ticket was not issued. I was upset, cancelled my flight and told them they shouldn't have called me and asked to remove my phone number. Next day when I gave a one-star rating to their automated customer service survey, I got another call from them at the middle of a meeting only to hear their explanation in more details ""why"" the price had gone up so I may change my rate for them. LOL"
"I am surprised they still in the business. I would highly recommend do NOT USE EXPLORE TRIP. Looks tempting, but reviews are terrible. Finally, after three attempts talking to customer service I found out that two tickets that I purchased were cancelled without any notifications. ""Because it were no fare for this price...???? Really???? I wish I paid a little more for better service. Wont ever risk it again with EXPLORE TRIP...Hope they run out of business for lying to people...."
"They will only go out of business if people researched them in advance and then booked with the airline, and not just threw money at them like you did."
"Elizabeth, I find it ironic that you nare one of the many people that ar ehelping them to stay in business. Not only that, it also encourages them not to improve."
"I checked out a flight, received a booking # and confirmation email about the booking, the standard stuff you get after you buy a flight.3 hours later received an email saying my card wasn't accepted (I can assure you, my card is working fine and was nowhere near my limit. I confirmed with my bank just in case, they said they did not decline on their end).I created an account on their website, logged in, and saw my booking right there, with the original price I booked with. Nothing said about pending or outstanding fees.Email says call to talk to representative.Called them - apparently although I received a confirmation email and my booking appears on their website, I wasn't charged the original amount. I was told i am a ""layman"" that does not understand prices change, and now the ticket is xxx amount more. I also ""don't understand"" the difference between confirmation and booking, and now that price has changed I need to pay more to confirm the booking. Absolutely hated dealing with them. He told me that it's no one's fault, its reality.Because I received a confirmation email, and THEIR website showed my booking, and then they try to squeeze more money out of me, I disagree. It's their fault. Horrible customer service. I definitely learned my lesson. Clearly this company is shady. Deal direct with the airline (ended up being cheaper with lufthansa direct than what explore trip was trying to charge me).Never again explore trip...never again."
"Got directed to book with them from the results on SkyScanner. Booking the flight was easy and that is where the nightmare began! I called them to cancel today and got informed that they will charge me a $200 fee to cancel ""but you'll get your credit back"". I was thinking ""Okay, you can take that fee our of my travel credit"" - NO, that $200 will be for THEM - EXPLORE TRIP, not for the airlines. Guess what? Since our flight booked with JetBlue, we will ALSO GET CHARGED ANOTHER $100/EA WHEN WE DECIDE TO USE THE CREDIT (which is now down to NOT EVEN ZERO but NEGATIVE if you do the math) from this whole experience. That's not even the best part yet! When I was saying (as I was thinking out loud) that maybe it'd be better to not showing up to our flight then. The lady, with the Indian accent that everybody mentioned, informed me that ""Oh no, that'd be no show and they will charge you a no show fee AND you'll get no credit from it"". Like do you even listen to yourself, lady. YOU'RE STRAIGHT UP SCAMMING ME RIGHT NOW!!!LONG STORY SHORT, JUST DON'T BOOK WITH THEM, AT NO COST. THERE'RE MANY OTHER RELIABLE SITES THAT YOU CAN BOOK CHEAP FLIGHTS WITH! BOYCOTT THESE SCAMMERS!"
"With the greatest of respect kim, it's wrong to say you were directed anywhere. Sites like Skyscanner display a list of results, and then the user chooses which ones they wish to follow. No one is taken anywhere against their will!I find most online booking sites to be unreliable because they don't have live pricing. Even when a site does have live prices, it's still an additional layer between the traveller and the airline. They will also almost always charge additional fees."
"Terrible experiences with them too. I booked international tickets from China to US. Usually, it includes 2 free pieces of luggage. But they said to me that because my price is extremely low so I need to pay 300 dollars more for the luggage. The truth is the price I booked every time is such amount with other agencies and I have booked the flight with more or less this amount for almost 20 times. Every time the luggage is included in the ticket price, except for the one I booked with them. Yet they don't tell you that you have no free luggage when you booked the ticket, you can only find it later when you ask them or at the check-in counter. Really annoying.Edited: 1 year ago "
Please pay the extra couple hundred dollars and save yourself the headache and loss. Airline changed my return flight time but explore trip did not send me a notification email. I showed at airport and flight had already departed. China Eastern Airline said only booking agency/explore trip could help me. I made about 20 phone calls to them. They gave made excuses and gave me the run around. The last rep I spoke to finally told me I was out of luck and should just book a new flight because calling them over and over won’t make a difference. My head is still spinning and I can’t believe this is happening. Stay away from Explore trip and China Eastern airlines.
"<<My head is still spinning and I can’t believe this is happening.>>Yes, having a third party between you and the airline makes life more complicated.BUT, even if you book directly with the airline, you should check your flights regularly, because email can end in the junk folder or ...."
<<China Eastern Airline said only booking agency/explore trip could help me.>><<Stay away from Explore trip and China Eastern airlines.>>Your choice to put a 3rd party between you and the carrier.Why do you say to stay away from China Eastern?You were not their customer. You were the customer of Explore Trip.You'd get pretty much the same response from any airline when you book with a 3rd party.
"I don't understand what China Eastern have done to make you avoid them. You appear to have missed the flight. Why is that their fault? You admit that it was the booking agent that did not inform of a schedule change.In any case, as Phil said, it's always a good idea to keep an eye on your upcoming flights no matter how you booked them."
"STAY AWAY FROM EXPLORETRIP!I should have read the reviews about ExploreTrip before I book my international flight. Unfortunately, I did not. This is the least reliable service you can find!One day after I booked my ticket on ExploreTrip, they sent me an e-mail saying that I have to provide a signed authorization of the credit card and copy of ID to complete my reservation. I have sent them all the requested documents on the same day. They replied; ""we have received your forms and we will update you on the status of your ticket shortly.""Next day (24 hours before my flight) I called them to see why I hadn't received any ticket number or update yet. They said; ""Your flight is canceled so your reservation has automatically cancelled too and we didn't provide you with a ticket !"" and yes without any notice! I was about to believe that and buy my ticket for another time. I could miss a very important appointment but I hesitated and called the airlines right after. The flight was perfectly on time so they were blatantly lying!! They attempted to fool me and sell another ticket to another time at a higher rate! After I talked to the airlines I called them back to say that the flight is not canceled. This time they said, ""Oh yes we are so sorry but the rate is not available anymore that's why canceled your reservation.""What a fraud company, what a terrible customer service!"
"We also had difficulties with ExploreTrip. Following an apparent change of schedule by the airline, firstly, they did not notify us via phone nor email. Then as my friend was travelling with a different agency, she found out that our flight had been pushed back a day. Contacting ExploreTrip 3 times over 2 days led to the following information:1. We would need to be charged a fee of just under $600 to cancel our flight...yes, the one that was canceled by the airlines. In addition, they wanted a change fee over $300 and also put me on a flight that, while now direct, was $200 more and resulted in not flying Business Class, but Premium economy. I politely declined this deal, but was told I would be contacted by the ""Exchange"" department. They never contacted me.2. The second time I was told that if the airline canceled then I wouldn't be liable for a cancellation nor change fee. We knew that by thn because we read the US Dept of Transportation guidelines.3. On the third time, we had learned through another agent (and online) that the original flight was still flying and so I called again, and they claimed not to have knowledge of it, but that I would need to wait 24-48 hours(which I already had done) and possibly to call them between 9AM-5PM Eastern time. To their credit, we finally did get an email that the flight indeed ad be reinstated.We will not ever use this company again."
"I have had a HORRIBLE experience with explore trip and am now NEVER going to book with them again and only through the airline or more trusted third parties. We arrived to the airport for our trip to Thailand only to discover that our flight had been cancelled and we were never informed and further more it appeared that our connecting flight never even existed in the first place as they only had one flight in and out which is not the one we had on our confirmation. We lost multiple nights in our hotel and explore trip did nothing to remedy this. Multiple representatives would not let us speak with a manager. They changed our return flight home as well. They are completely unhelpful, unresponsive, and have poor costumer service. I have learned many good and hard lessons through booking with them and will never do it again. Save yourself the hassle and do not book with them no matter how cheap the fair it is not worth it!"
"Let me add to the chorus of warnings against this company. My daughter booked a flight to Prague, we verbally gave my credit card over the phone, thought we had her ticket, were able to book seats and everything on the airline website, and the price was amazing. Then a couple days later, my daughter forwarded to me a weird email from ExploreTrip asking for me to fill out and email them a signed form with the same credit card info I had already provided over the phone. It sounded sketchy to me, so I contacted the airline and learned that I didn't actually even have an airline ticket. That's when I found this forum, and went with another travel company. Luckily, my credit card was never charged. But then, just this week, my daughter's friend who was the one who told her about ExploreTrip, found that his flight too was NEVER booked (five weeks earlier), and he was NEVER notified about this. So now he's also having to find a new travel company at much greater expense and flight limitations -- which he can't even do without his refund from ExploreTrip, which hasn't come yet. This is a horrible company."
"It's a scam. Booked a flight to Hong Kong and Singapore last night and everything went well. Their price was about $150 cheaper than other places. Checked with the airline, everything as legit. Got an email this morning saying that tickets were cancelled, didn't really give me a reason just want me to call them back so they can hike the price up. I called my credit card company to make sure that I will get my money back. My credit card company is well aware of this scam and recommended me to cancel the card since God know who else they have given my info to"
"when you make a ""request"" for a third party to book on your behalf, they will make a booking and which needs to ticketed within a certain period otherwise it automatically cancelsIt is not a scam and if you try and use any other third party that does not have live pricing (most of them) you will find the same....generally by the time you have been messed about and waited for your money back, the real prices (which can be found on the airline website) are likely increasing. Trying to chase imaginary cheap fares will ultimately cost you more money"
"I have booked with 3rd party like orbitz.com, expedia.com and never have any problems before. This exploretrip.com site is using the same tactic for all of their customers. I got the ticket numbers issued by the airline last night. Everything was confirmed directly with the airline. I should have done my homework before booking with them. Lesson learned :)."
Unfortunately I use these guys before I read any reviews and they screwed up my reservation and booked the return portion on the wrong date they told me they would help me out and get it fixed that's been over a month ago and now their customer support service is not calling me back or responding to my emails. lesson learned
"No, it IS a scam. My daughter's friend, whose flight was cancelled and he wasn't even notified, is STILL awaiting his refund weeks and weeks later. He CANNOT afford to get a new ticket without his refund and he is due to leave on his trip very soon. Other companies are NOT like this one."
"DO NOT BOOK WITH EXPLORE TRIP. I recently booked an international flight two months in advance and made sure that the airline booking showed up on the Lufthansa site. I received confirmation from Explore Trip regarding the booking. But 2 days before my departure, I checked Lufthansa site and my outbound flight had been cancelled by Explore Trip. It took me 16 hours of phone conversations to make them correct it. Lufthansa said that some agencies will drop your booking to find something cheaper and will leave you hanging. They NEVER notified me that they had dropped my outbound flight and lied that Lufthansa cancelled the flight. It took over 15 calls to get it fixed and was extremely stressful. I WILL NEVER BOOK WITH EXPLORE TRIP AGAIN."
"YEs, I booked something with them ,realize I made a mistake 30 minutes later. They wouldn't let me cancel it and just argued with me over the amount to refund me and said they had to pay ""taxes to the airline"" which simply don't make sense. These guys are a complete and utter scam."
"I was hoping it was just one or two bad apples in the agency based on reviews. But I found every person I called was out to get extra fees out of me. First they don't confirm the tickets you paid for. Then when you call, they jack up the price or put you on a less desirable flight so that you might pay extra to change it back to the original. STAY AWAY from this site. They will try to act like they are trying their best to get the best flight for you, after ""schedule change"" Dont be deceived."
"They are still at the same tricks - would urge anyone considering them to listen to these reviews and DO NOT book with them. Pay the extra, go with the airline direct, save yourself the stress. They are con artists."
I second this experience. Deal directly with the Airline.
"I bought a ticket for India from Toronto through SkipLagged (and its not the first time i used that site) It took me to ExploreTrip to confirm the booking. I made my purchase and i received a Booking Confirmation, but I was to receive the e-ticket within 4 hours. 14 hours later, and 3 phone calls to ExploreTrip, the best excuse I got was 'your travel date is far, so your purchase is still in queue'. My 4th call was an extremely polite cancellation which was fortunately successful. Speaking with my bank, they told me that a purchase was NOT made, and that there is nothing for me to worry about. This however isn't the funny part.I sent a feedback mail to SkipLagged. Next day, i get 2 phone calls from ExploreTrip, one from California, and another from New York. Both said SkipLagged contacted them and they wanted to know if I was still interested. They both got an earful from me and because the call was (allegedly) recorded, they didn't say or deny anything, except say that they are thankful for my feedback and they would let management know. un-surprisingly, they both didn't know that I had cancelled the trip with one of their agents the previous night.I still trust SkipLagged, and will continue to do so, since I have booked through them multiple times. ExploreTrip, however, would't travel through them if my life depended on it."
"Same here! Very unprofessional service. I booked a flight one day at 3pm and the same day at midnight they sent an email saying they needed to confirm the credit card information. It said I had 4 hours to reply. I saw the email next day at 9am and called and they said the flight had gone up $100 which was not true. I was checking Expedia and Orbitz and the same flight had gone $50 dollars. Then when I said I had to go to a meeting and that I needed to call them back later, the person talking got rude and started to speak very loud saying that if I didn't book the flight , it was going to cost $900 dollars. Since I actually had to leave to a meeting I told them to cancel. Then I looked in Expedia and found the same flight very close to the price I got it initially. Only $40 dollars more expensive, but not $100 more and not $350 certainly and with a more reliable booking party. I'd say, it's better not to book with them to save you time and headaches."
EXPLORE TRIP IS A SCAM!!! Do not make the same mistake as I did. Do not book with this company! I should have investigated and read more reviews online before booking with this horrible company. They have terrible customer service and their business model seems to be built on screwing over their customers to make a profit. Please advise your friends and family to stay away from this company.
"Annalena, please don;t think that any other third party booking sites claiming to offer cheap flights is going to be any better. Some will probably be even worse!"
I have the same experience and they charged my credit card twice!!!! and did not sent the e-ticket
"Save your money and protect your credit card information. This company is dishonest, horrible customer service and will keep ""canceling"" your reservations until the trip is 3x the original price. I noticed my original $98 flight had not been confirmed as I was not issued an e-ticket. I called and was told by a rep that the flight price had changed and was canceled so I'd need to book a new flight on a different airline for $148, but they'd issue a inconvenience credit making the new flight $1180. 5 hours had passed and still no confirmation email or ticket so i called back. After being hung up on 3x I finally got a rep with some answers. They told me the same, the flight wasn't confirmed because the price was now $350!Completely disgusted and concerned for my privacy, I cancelled any reservations through them and went online to search flights for the same trip myself. I readily found flights with 3 major airlines for close to the same $100 price range. So where did the $350 come from!? FRAUDS Keep in mind, all this the day BEFORE my flight! Horrible experience. DO NOT TRUST THEM"
these people are bunch of crooks. Dont buy a ticket from them.
"I did not read past the bit that said the airline had cancelled the onward flight, which is what ALWAYS happens with any airline if you are a no-show on an earlier flight all on the same ticket. ""Darwyn"" told you the truth, and the rest of you post has no relevance after that.Explore.trip are completely innocent in regards to the cancellation."
"I replied to Roy's duplicate post on another Explore Trip thread. They are not to blame in this instance, but I still wouldn't use them!"
Got charged 4 (four) times. $1200 X 4. Cant't appreciate BofA more for blocking my card. Found them on Skyscanner.
I don't suppose you checked them and their reputation out after finding them?
"Useful info ... thank you, I was about to book. How about Flighthub?Vancouver to BaliEdited: 1 year ago "
"""How about Flighthub?""There is a search box at the top of each page. Go and get the popcorn and read some of the results. The search will default to 'Relevance' and you should change that to 'Date'."
How about booking directly with the airline? It most probably won;t be any more expensive in the end than using one of the shonkies.
"Called Explore trip after realizing my bank had not charged me a few weeks after confirmation email came. Rep said trip was confirmed and proceeded to notify me that we had zero baggage allowance (carry on or checked). He said they may have some vouchers for deals on baggage that he could offer. $25 per bag rather than $50 charged by airline (Scandinavian Air). I fell for it and purchased bags for my entire family. Once I received confirmation of the change via email, my call was lost. I then got online to check Explore Trip reviews. My confirmation email did not include the airline booking number, which meant I could not confirm my trip with the airline. I was able to contact another Explore Trip Representative who gave me the airline booking number and I was able to confirm the trip. All in all, I am satisfied with my correspondence with Explore Trip. I'm not sure I will ever know if I truly did not have any baggage allowance included in my initial reservation."
Don’t do it they are the worst. There are better people that deserve the money.
Lucky you its better to book online or through a direct Travel agency .
Explore trip guys are fraud. I booked tickets and I wanted to cancel they told non refundable. I called airlines airline told deducting $200 fully refundable. When i told explore travel they come up with a deal $200+$400 and $400 i have to pay by credit card . Those guys tricked my wife took credit card and $400 .. Please never ever book by explore trip ..!!!
"Explore Trip is completely pathetic when it comes to customer service. I had an involuntary schedule change on a BA flight and they kept shuttling me between the BA customer service and their customer service. I was on hold for hours together over a span of multiple calls to Explore Trip with no resolution of the matter. They seem to have an operation that is highly skilled at evading the customer not servicing the customer! NEVER again EXPORE Trip. Also, please be very wary when you look for flights through SKIPLAGGED, they send you to EXPLORE Trip as they seem to have some arrangement."
advice on here is to book direct with the airline. Much easier to deal with anything like this...always going to be more complex when you choose to put a middleman (third party) between you and the airline
I should have listened to you. I booked through Explore trip. Alaska company cancelled my flight and moved the time to next day 10 hours before departure. NO ONE TOLD ME THAT!!!!!!! I called explore trip. they are not responsible at all. Will never use explore trip again.
Terrible and AMATEUR service! Dont buy with them!
"Hi, I also strongly suggest anyone to not book any ticket with this agency. While almost all agencies give free cancellation within 24 hours, these people charge heavily. I booked international ticket and within 6 hours I had to cancel due to plan changes. They charged me $100 per ticket. There is some user agreement somewhere in their website which mentions about this it seems. Such cheats."
"Aiirlines for Us bookings give free 24 hour cancellation, some other airlines domtoo but the DOT regulations you’re thinking of are not fornthird party bookings. They’re entitled to charge you the fees you agreed to, if they have to do extra work for you, because you changed your plans.Book directly with the airline next time.Edited: 1 year ago "
"How are they cheats when they had you agree to cancellation fees and then enforce them when you cancel? It sounds like you were the one trying to cheat them out of the fees they were owed! The irony! Had you booked directly with the airline from the US, then that nice DOT rule would have applied and you would have received a full refund."
"If you had looked at the T&C's before rushing to give them your money, perhaps you would have noticed that there is no 24 period for free cancellation and had a rethink.They can only be cheats if they say there is 24 hour cancellation without penalty and then they refuse to honour that. You not seeing that there is no such thing does not make them cheats, it makes you look foolish, that's all.If you don't check these kinds of things in future, it's likely you'll find other, very similar nasty surprises are in store."
">> almost all agencies give free cancellation within 24 hours, <<I disagree with that statement. Many airlines give free 24 hour cancellation. Very few third parties give 24 hour cancellation (Expedia) and some give it only for US flights (kiwi!)>> within 6 hours I had to cancel due to plan changes. <<If you had read the t&cs before agreeing to them, the table under Post-Ticketing Fees shows clearly the cost of changes/cancellations both within the 1st 24 hours from booking and also after 24 hours>> some user agreement somewhere in their website which mentions about this it seems. <<yes, it is something you are required to state that you have read and agree to it before a booking can be made....if you did this without bothering to read the wording you cannot complain when you do not get what you assumed as you assumed wrongly"
I also had same problem with Exploretrip.com Their customer care complete flop..Better Book ticket thru airlines direct websites. So you do not have any problem..
Hi Laurie! Just wondering if you made your flight ok. I booked a flight 2 months out and just hoping that all goes well. I confirmed my flight with the airline and all seems ok at this point but just wanted to make sure that there are some success stories.
did the charge say explore trip on your statement?
Has anyone had a bad experience with Explore! tours they have taken
Hi there. I will open a similar case. Did yours bear fruit?
"The WORST purches in my life. DONT EVER BUY FROM THEM tickets! If could be shut down that firm and site would be the greatest news for travelers.Two days whole and night , I was purchasing the ticket.Two days the incabable customer support was driving me crazy. One hole day they needed to send us a mail to say that they can not make a confirmation ažof my card and they need a photo of my visa card and my ID. We had a talk to prove me is this a legal move that they ask for. Of cours that they just say its our policy like that. Then I provided them what they wanted,sended a photos of my document and visa, while I was on line. They said:thank you so much,we RECIVED your mail it will be processed soon. We call again,afther one hour...they said that I call just before 20 min ..and they need for it 2 hours. Than agin we called AFTHER THAT 2 HOURS They said its procesing , everything will be fine in one hour more. That was araund 1 AM . We couldn't wait no more an went to sleep.My husbant called agianat 7 am,They say that thy are sorry and will be in one hour the latest. Finaly they call...during the call I said all the informations I provide are truly,and I got the answer:sorry mam,that is not card that you provided us with. Then I started to raise my voice,what are u speking about ,2 days on line with you for purchasing one ticket. .then the ROB SMITH (??) said how we didnt send to theys mail(?!?!)I said that we send on recived mail that time while the operate of theys suppor said we send you a mail and replay ON THIS mail and NOT TO other mail with our documents. Then what we was doing all night and why customer support told us then they got my documents sendig it we see and it was processed.!!!!???? Then of course,a speach like this is not a proper way how you speak ,. We spoke with 4 or more diffrent people in customer support, for 48 hours. This is not a serious firm .I am a fraid for a ticket for my mother in low. She has to travel to see her paasin away mother. We are so stresed because this. I am gona go on every site thet provides they link to say what torcher I lived from them so no one to pass same like me. I wished that I never pressed buy option. Please belive me, I too work with people and I am somones employee. Its not thet one emloyer is not good in his job, they are all,all not good and they are making scames .All that firm should be just closed."
"If your mother-in-law so badly needed to travel, why would ever mess around with a shoddy third party middleman?"
"The best way to get them closed down is if no one uses them. Sadly, posting here and everywhere else on the internet isn't going to achieve that."
"Hola a Todos,Soy de colombia y necesitaba comprar un ticket para USA. Con la agencia me fue bien, me consiguieron el pasaje mas barato en ese momento. Mejoras? se demoraron al rededor de 4-5 horas en mandarme el Email de confirmacion de compra del ticket oficial.Pero en general me parecio muy bueno el servicio.--Hi everybody,I'm from Colombia and I needed to buy a ticket to USA. The agency works good, they helped me to get the best cheap ticket in the tickets-pages in that moment. Improvements? They were delayed about 4-5 hours to send me the official ticket confirmation email.In general, I think that the service was good."
"This company explore trip is horrible , I bought the ticket at 9pm , called to cancel at 11pm within 24 hours , they want charged you $200 , ugly !!!"
"Agree with you , horrible company"
>> they want charged you $200 <<looks like you missed the fees when you read and agreed to the t&cs.Void/Cancel (Within 24 Hours) - US Origin Bookings...International....$200Void/Cancel (Same day before Midnight) - NON US Origin...International...$200If you want a free 24 hour cancellation you should look to book direct with the airline...third parties will always want paid for their 'service'
Yet another North A Erica. Who knows about the DOT regulations of free cancellation within 24 hours but nkt the really important part that it doesn’t apply when you don’t book directly with the airline
"I wish I saw this post before I booked with Explore Trip on 5/20/19! Same thing happened to me. Booking confirmed and then cancelled on the same day. How does this happen! They can't explain. I checked to confirm flight a few days before take off and found it had been cancelled soon after I received the confirmation of the booking. I had to re-book at a significant increase and I booked directly with the airline and not through some shady online ""travel agency"". DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!"
"Jeb, my guess is you never had a booking. Remember, you don’t make a booking with ExploreTrip. You make a booking request. Sometimes the request can not be fulfilled and the request will simply be canceled. The only thing that was “confirmed” was that your booking request had been received."
The price you see on the website does not exist.
"I'm confident that no booking was confirmed and that what you received was, in fact, a confirmation that Explore Trip had received your request for them to get you a ticket.It's not that they can't explain, they just don't want to tell the truth about how it all works."
"WARNING ---DON’T BOOK WITH EXPLORETRIP !!!!I purchased flight tickets from Exploretrip in April. Around mid June, I found out from my friend who ordered her ticket from a different company that one of our flights was cancelled. Her company had reached out to notify her about the cancellation immediately and gave her a refund right away.I promptly contacted exploretrip to get more information. I asked if they were going to call to notify customers about the cancellation. The rep tells me that they had not notified me of the flight cancellation because the trip was still too far out. They were not planning to notify passengers until within a month before departure. I told him that's not right! I requested a refund since there was no alternate flight. I was told to wait 24-48 hours for them to contact the airline for approval of refund.For the next six weeks , I called exploretrip six times to follow up the status of my refund. I needed their refund to purchase our new tickets. The ticket prices go up day by day, and now my entire trip planning was delayed due to Exploretrip's incompetence and refusal to work with me to find a solution. I file a complaint to BBB in late July. The next day, I got an email (finally) from Exploretrip, asking me to acknowledge their email to proceed with the refund. So I did. A day later, ExploreTrip tells me that I will receive the refund amount in 3-4 WEEKS. By the time I receive my refund, it will be late August. My trip is September 1st. I need new plane tickets for my trip. The original tickets cost over $2500 and comparable tickets are getting more expensive every day, as I wait for my money to be credited back to my account. The first time I called ExploreTrip, they said that they normally don’t notify their customers about flight cancellations until a few weeks before the trip. This is utterly disrespectful to customers who expect open communication with the company that is providing services. I need to change plans and buy new tickets accordingly. ExploreTrip does not care about the inconvenience and stress they cause their customers. Please do not use this company for your travel needs!!!!!!!"
Same here. I booked a flight from Honolulu to Prague last night. The price was 1/4 the price if I book it directly with the airline. It was $550 on explore trip vs almost $2grand with American. I checked my credit card and I was charged the exact amount $550. I also received my e-ticket number so I checked american website and found my reservation so I selected my seats. My trip is not until December/2019.I'm hoping this won't happen to me.Edited: 1 year ago 
"Another warning. Wish I found this forum before I booked. Don't know what to do at this point. Booked international tickets to Thailand $1400. Received flight confirmation but found my credit card was charged $1550 instead - no explanation from ExploreTrip. Called ExploreTrip for explanation and decided to cancel (and pay 200$ fee per User Agreement). In an email, ExploreTrip confirmed $1200 would be refunded. Inexplicably, refunded $800 several days later... I've been calling ExploreTrip to find out what happened with no success.....still calling them once a day but no resolution yet. Stay away, book direct. Expensive lesson learned."
"Awful!! Got a confirmation of my flight and the day after got an email to say that my flight booking was cancelled over 12 hours later of course by that time the flight prices had doubled! I emailed and rang and was met with a rude response that it was my own problem and not theirs and I was welcome to buy a new flight at the current price. Shocking behavior for a business, disgraceful to be honest. Will be avoiding this company and telling others to do the same."
"“Got a confirmation of my flight and the day after got an email to say that my flight booking was cancelled over 12 hours later”You did not receive a receive a confirmation of your booking; you received a confirmation of your booking request. You do not make bookings on Explore Trip (or other shonky third party middlemen), but rather booking requests as they do not have live prices. After you make the request, the third party has between 48-72 hours to complete the request. If they cannot, you will either be offered a higher price (the real price) or the request will be cancelled. This is what happened to you. You actually escaped quite easily and nicely. Of course, this process is clear in the thousands of reviews online and in the terms and conditions which you agreed to and I assume didn’t read."
">> of course by that time the flight prices had doubled <<I would wager that this was not the case....you saw a 'suck in', non-live price advertised which was half the real price....you made a booking request and they cannot get the flight for you at the non-live price.If you want to find live prices and almost instant confirmation (rather than 48-72 hours) you will find the airline websites are the place to be looking. You could go round in circles for ages chasing non-existent third party flogger adverts."
Explore trip company is a complete SCAM. I bought a ticket and it says economy for $650 CAD. I happened to call them to verify my ticket and they then tell me I bought a basic economy NOT economy so it doesn’t include MEALS AND CHECK IN BAGGAGE. They advertise fake news and fake advertisement because their website does not mention that your baggage and meals are not included in your ticket. Plus my ticket says ECONOMY NOT BASIC ECONOMY but they keep telling me that my ticket is basic economy. They then say proceed to say I need to pay an addition $150 to get check in baggage and meals. What type of company scams you this way??? The worst part is that their website says they are accredited Better Business Bureau accredited with A+ rating. All false advertisement and is a complete SHAME that BBB would give them an A+ rating. I wish I could paste my screen shot onto this website and show the world what type of scam Explore Trip is doing. They need to be up front with people and STATE clearly that there are additional fees prior to selling anything!!!!
Thanks for letting me know. I just booked a ticket too like i always do but the payments hasn't left my account and exactly the same. They just confirm that my flight has been booked. Lucky me still tickets available and don't understand the reason of doing this. i flight often and never had this before. But thank you for letting me know.
"People need to research before buying and they’d save themselves a lot of grief.All these shonky ticket floggers advertising cheap fares invariably sell you the cheapest fare type the airline offers - basic economy.I find when you book direct with the airline, they make it very clear what’s us and isn’t included in each fare type.Please don’t shout at us, we had nothing to do with your choice of third party"
"You're absolutely right. They lure you in with a low price and send cancellation hours later, just so that they can get more money from you for the same itinerary."
"""You're absolutely right. They lure you in with a low price and send cancellation hours later, just so that they can get more money from you for the same itinerary.""No you've got the wrong idea. They advertise a low price that often no longer exists, because they don't want to pay the cost of having real time pricing. You make a booking request, not an actual booking. Up to 48 hours later some call centre worker goes on line and tries to book the flight for you, but finds that they cannot get seats at the price. One of three things then happens - they call you or email you and tell you the price has gone up, or they call/email you and tell you that your payment has failed, pretend to try again only to discover the price has ""gone up"" in the meantime, or they just do nothing at all. If you agree to pay more, then they book the seats for you. Otherwise you've never had a booking in the first place, so there's nothing for them to cancel.The one thing you mustn't do is use the word ""cancel"" - if you do, they are entitled under the terms and conditions you will have clicked through instead of reading, to charge you a cancellation fee. Instead, tell them you don;t want to proceed with the booking. You still don;t have any tickets, but at least you get to keep your money.Of course you could just have booked with the airline in the first place, found the exact price for cabin class, seating, baggage etc, and got your tickets instantly, probably paying less than ExploreTrip's final price."
"Hi,I just had a bad experience with explore trip. I called the customer services and asked for the baggage information regarding a flight with Eva Air. The representative named Ray or Greg provided the necessary information and informed that I had to pay for check-in baggage, which surprised me because we have traveled with Eva and China Airline before. The representative used sale tactics by lowering the baggage fee from $75-$50 (per person) and insisted that I would have to pay more at the airport. He also encouraged me to pay for both passengers by offering a steeper discount and did not let me get off the phone. I eventually refused to pay and hung up. The representative called back a few minutes later and tried to finalize the transaction but I told him that I felt rushed. The representiave hung up the phone before I finished my statement. When I spoke to Eva Air, I was told that there is no fee associated with check-in baggage. Falsifying the information to force customers to pay hidden fees is unacceptable."
Was everything ok after that? Because everything's confirm and I also check with the airline and everything is ok but my trip is only in 2 months...
"Hi, can you provide an update?Were you able to travel using the tickets from explore trips?"
"Just want to share my experience with ExploreTrip so the continuity of their questionable practices is maintained,As a seasoned traveller, I fell into a trap which ended up being a life lesson. I booked a flight from YYZ to Vietnam in January 2019 for April travel. Received a confirmation of the booking and put it out of my mind expecting the eticket to arrive closer to the flight date. One month before my trip, I inquired about my eticket but got no reply. Several days before my flight I again attempted to contact the company by email and phone with at least 2 hang ups when I challenged the call centre employee. Finally reached someone who informed me that the ticket was not confirmed. A call to China Eastern Airlines showed my name but no confirmation. After several calls and emails, I was notified that in January an email was sent advising that the reservation was cancelled and the card not charged. Numerous calls followed to determine the reason for cancellation and lack of notification. Subsequently they forward an email ""allegedly"" sent indicating their fraud prevention team had cancelled my booking. It certainly looked like a cut and paste email. I had been using my VISA for months with no issues, so I am not sure what their criteria for ""fraud"" involved. All calls to the company were lacking in any customer service etiquette and were more concerned in booking a new flight at double the price. I checked the BBB and 231 complaints have been filed against this company, with issues worse than what I experienced. People lost money.It is interesting that many of the complaints revolve around the same general issues which indicate these shameful tactics are part of ExploreTrips consistent practices. With air travel prices increasing, travellers are looking for the best deals. Unfortunately, they come with headaches in this case. The company reached out to me after I posted on TrustPilot and when I advised I was submitting a claim to the BBB. Too little, too late. Will they reimburse me for the difference in cost to buy a new ticket? Doubt it. Buyer beware... even the best of us fall for these unsavory tactics. Wont get fooled again...thanks ExploreTrip.Edited: 5:04 pm, October 26, 2019 "
"Hi, no was not Able o travel. Had to purchase new tickets at double the cost 2 days before my planned departure. Lost out on hotel reservation and car pick up.lEdited: 6:47 am, December 06, 2019 "
"STAY AS FAR AWAY form these scammers as possible. Once you have paid them they will cancel your flight for unknown reasons and keep your money until you contact them. They will send you bogus fake e-tickets. If you do not make sure you receive one they will never send it and never tell you. If your ticket was canceled and in most cases it will be, they will make is extremely difficult for you to get a refund (if you even do, as I'm still waiting) and they will try to waste as much of your time as possible keeping you on hold. If you are upset the rep you are speaking to will personally say, ""I will not give you a refund, because you are mad"". What are we suppose to feel when you con us out of our money and kick us off our flights for no reason. Further more if you purchase more than one ticket they will tell you you only purchased one ticket and that they can not find the other one, ""Like duh, you guys canceled my reservation"". They do this to make it seem like you purchased one ticket for the price of two, so they can keep the rest of the money you paid them. They will do their best to swindle you out of your money for the second ticket. This place is an absolute scam. Been flying for a while now and this was my first time using them (through Sky Scanner, super disappointing). Never had a problem before with other third party's until now. It's basically a waiting game scam. You buy tickets. They send you fake e-tickets. Once your flight is coming up and you try to print them out you realize they don't exist. You call them and they make up lies and try to swindle you that your reservation got canceled and they cannot find your tickets. They send you more fake e-tickets.Stay far far far away from this shady business. Honestly I do not know how it even has positive reviews. I have seen so many people 's post run into the same occurrence as I have from this business. Do your self a favor. Go somewhere else."
"Cher #156,It really does no good, to dredge up every thread on Explore Trip, and post basically the same thing to each.That is considered spamming the Forum.Many do this, in hopes that others see their posts - but think about for a bit. There were existing threads on this agent already. You did not research here, before using them. Very, very few will either.Most folk find TA, and the Air Travel Forum, only AFTER they have made a mistake.Best of luck, and one post is enough, please.Hunt"
"I booked a one way ticket to Prague in July 2019 for December 2019 travel. I booked it through exploretrip via Skiplagged. I had no problem at all. When I got my confirmation from exploretrip, I called American airlines and verified my reservation. My trip was fine. I guess i'm lucky. The ticket cost me $550 and when I checked my miles activity, the EQD's was over $1000.. Another bonus."
"Worst company EVER to deal with. I had to cancel my flight in Sept. They said I had a credit. In order to even use my credit then I have to pay an ADDITIONAL $120. The dates were wrong, they are not owning up to it and now in order to correct the dates, they want an additional $321 dollars. My original ticket was only 400 and now they want double that for 1 flight."
"Even though 2019-nCoV (2019 Novel Coronavirus, Wuhan, China) and international news said can free cancellation but still hard to get a full refund. This agent charges too much money for a penalty and why in this situation still charge penalty?"
Contact international news and ask them to help you get the refund they said you were entitled to.

"Patty T (Post 160 "".This agent charges too much money for a penalty.."" Unfortunately I am not sure exactly what you mean . Assuming that English is not your first language what I THINK you are trying to say is that you decided to cancel a booking made through Explore because of the 2019-nCoV (Wuhan coronavirus) outbreak and are having difficulty with Explore getting any money back and/or are unhappy at the cancellation fees they charge - is that correct ?Even if the ticket you bought is a fully refundable one, the contract you entered into with Explore when booking your trip via them commits you to paying the fees outlined in the company's published T&Cs . All the fees that the company charges for handling cancellation requests, changes to bookings etc . etc are shown in those T&Cs and by proceeding through the booking process you have AGREED to pay them so they are legally entitled to deduct them from any refund you may be due from the airline If the tickets were non refundable ones (as many sold by this type of cheap deal OTA usually are) and the flight itself was not cancelled by the airline, then you are probably not entitled to full refund anyway (on non refundable tickets you only get any airport taxes back) and Explore are still entitled to charge their cancellation fees from that and only give you any small balance left. Your best option may be to see whether your travel insurance covers you for cancelling the trip, but I fear that deciding not to go because of worries about the Wuhan virus probably isn't covered because unless your government advice to its citizens is not to travel ( the British FCO -Foreign and Commonwealth Office- has not issued any advice to British nationals that it’s not safe to travel at this stage - (the latest advice on the Public Health England website as of today is merely that ""The risk to visitors to Wuhan is moderate reflecting an increase in the number of cases being identified in China and evidence that the virus has limited spread from person to person"")Edited: 1:20 pm, January 22, 2020 "

"Exploretrip is probably the worst. Their customer service is absolutely terrible, you will be lucky if they even answer your call"
#165'Exploretrip is probably the worst.'Say it ain't so!
"I'm going through a similar issue with Exploretrip. Me and my husband booked tickets to Bangkok from Toronto and the layover was in Shangai China. The airline is China Eastern and even on their website it states we should get a full refund (Exploretrip stated ours is non-refundable) but since we are worried about the coronavirus be decided to cancel and they are charging $800 and (almost the price of 1 ticket). This is not fair, how do I handle this when the 781 tickets even on the China Eastern airlines website states we can? Please advise"
"sobana,You didn’t book directly with the airline. You chose to book with Exploretrip, so you are bound by their fees and charges for cancelling."
"Avanti_SG is correct. The message on the airline’s site is for those who booked directly with the airline. You didn’t, so you have to,pay the agent for handling this for you. There’s nothing you can do to force the agent to reduce or waive the fees you agreed to.You could check to see if your travel insurance policy will cover the shortfall in refund (assuming your arranged cover)."
"The trouble is, sobana, that you are governed by the third party's terms and conditions as well as the airline's. And it's the agent that you have a contract with, not the airline, sorry."
Big big big cheater exploretrip. We book 3 tickets for china Now over there have cornavirus and we want to cancel tickets. They not retuning any money. We call schizuan airline and they say they all ready confirm any one can cancel tickets they not charge any cancellation fee. But exploretrip people not returning any money. Even when i called no answer hold phone line 1hour 45 minutes. Then they cut my phone. Really a... wh... PLEASE DONT USE THERE SERVICES. STAY AWAY FROM THEM.
"What a pity. Had you booked direct, it sounds as though you would have no problems getting a refund."

"I have encountered the same issue with Exploretrip. Due to the coronavirus, my flight from HK to Koh Samui was cancelled. I tried to contact Bangkok Airway for a refund, they asked me to contact Exploretrip. But I have been waiting for more than 5 days and still no reply. Just wondering is there anyone know which consumer protection bureau is responsible for handling travel agency complaint in North America? Thank you!"
EXPLORE TRIP is TERRIBLE! Even with the global crisis going on with Coronavirus they would not refund tickets. They said it would be $200 to change the date and absolutely no refunds. Never book with them they do not care at all about human life all they care about is money.

Never do the business with explore trip again. Make them out of business. Some crooks !!!!
Why didn’t I listen!!! Oh god. ExploreTrip are the worst!!! Please I beg do not buy from these ppl.
"Don’t tell us, Sami, we know. This thread is over two years old and your post isn’t going to change anyone’s mind.You need to tell your friends and post on Facebook and reach the people like you who don’t do research and warn THEM away from these bad companies."
"Travel agency ExploreTrip asks for a big sum of money to reschedule an (Turkish Airlines) airline ticket due to coronavirus. They claim it’s not up to them, but I know they are taking advantage of this situation. They say that the additional payment is for price difference and tax purposes.However, long story short,In the beginning of this year (02.05.2020) me and my family decided to travel on a same departure date, but different return dates. Because of that we had to purchase two separate tickets, separate Travel agencies (me ExploreTrip, them Vayama). Both Turkish Airlines, both ORD-***-***. Mine (***) departs May 29, return June 3. Theirs (***, ***, ***) departs May 29, returns August 6.Now, since Turkish Airlines resumes it’s flying on June 11 (for the specific destination) my family receives several e-mails from their Travel agency (Vayama) about rescheduling, no question asked, no price increase. Since I haven’t received a single email from “my” Travel agency (ExploreTrip) I’ve decided to give them a call.The first representative I spoke with said I’ll need to pay an additional $195 for the price difference. When I confronted him with the fact that I can still find the same exact fare for the new dates requested (I have to note, due to the coronavirus pandemics. I’d rather travel on the original dates), than he changed his answer to “their” price difference. That sounded a little bit confusing but I realized they wanted to earn a “little” bit more that they already have. I just can’t understand the greed during this tough times.The second one I spoke with said I’ll need to pay the taxes only, which is $453.65. It’s crazy how uncoordinated they were. When asked who gets to collect the taxes he didn’t have the answer. When asked who would charge me taxes for a service I haven’t used, he didn’t have an answer as well. When asked who do I call to complain about this, he said only the travel agencies have a access to that kind of info.I didn’t believe in any one of them. Next I called Turkish Airlines directly. They tried to help with the rescheduling but with no success. They only left a note for ExploreTrip to see. They only said that it’s up to the Travel agency to decide what the tickets they issue. I don’t get it how come I didn’t have any issue with Vayama, but I do with ExploreTrip.So that’s my story and that’s how I know they are taking advantage of the current pandemics."
"I should have saw this before I started booking with this site.They are saying one thing doing another thing,I think I will be spending money to hire lawyer if they are doing the same thing"
