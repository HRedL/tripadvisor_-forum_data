"We called them today to see if we could delay our trip due to the pandemic. SATA, the airline that they use is allowing free changes to their flight reservations due to the pandemic. Azores Getaways will let us change the date not cancel. I was told that for $600 each we could delay the trip until the end of May. The trip only cost $649.00 each to begin with. Just sharing for others who are worried about traveling at this time."
I called them today also and they told me that a decision has not been made as to how they will handle the situation. Sata needs to meet the needs of their customers and find a acceptable plan. We as customers should be given a full refund or a credit for the amount that we paid and our choice of when we will be able to reschedule. LL
"We chose the date of March 18th because it was affordable. to change until end of May was double the price. Many of Azores getaways customers cannot afford to pay double the price. Many of us are repeat customers with Azores Getaways, (Sata). We keep their business alive. Sata it is your turn to satisfy the customers needs, not make decisions that suit your needs, not this time! TRAVELERS with Sata Count!"
"Glad we're not alone. This is a scary time for all of us. We haven't cancelled the trip yet, March 19 from Toronto, but we will not be traveling next week for sure. I'm hoping by Wednesday they will have a better offer for us. Chances are this will not be resolved by May, so I'd rather just cancel for now and rebook once the situation is resolved. Not really looking for a refund just some flexibility We were really looking forward to this trip and had booked a tour and rented a car , both of which were refunded right away. We definitely will take this trip in the future, it looks to be an amazing  destination."
I was supposed to travel to Terceira last night from Boston. I left Chicago in the morning. I was so excited. Right before it was time to board two agents gathered everyone and said if we got on the plane we would be stuck in Portugal for at least a month. We were brought back to the agents we checked in with and our boarding passes were canceled. We were told to call in the morning for refunds/rebookings. In a panic I had to find a hotel room and find a flight out of Boston for this morning. It was all very expensive. When I got up I called Azores Getaways and was told they had meetings going on to determine what to do. Around 2PM today I got an email saying there was nothing they could do for me. I am SO ANGRY. I spent so much money and nothing in return except for more headaches and expenses.
"Wow, that's terrible. They definitely have a customer service issue at Azores Getaways. I just read your post to my hubby and he said ""that's terrible. If that's how they're going to be treating this crisis, I don't even want to go there now""."
Update...received an email this morning from azores getaways that we can delay up until the end of may at no cost to us. Can go beyond the end of May by request to be verified with the airline. There's hope!
Nobody gonna be going anywhere this year.thats for sure! This will keep spreading until they have s vaccine.
Trying to get through to Azores Getaways by email. Due to go April 8 no reply.
"i also have a trip booked with them April 2nd from Toronto..i did receive an email from them March 15th stating they would be contacting everyone based on travel dates. To reschedule, or find a solution, I will wait until Monday and if i don't hear from them, i will send them an email. and see if i get a response."

"Did you have any luck? We're due to leave Toronto on April 9, 2020."
I was scheduled to fly to the Azores April 1st to 9th. Trip was cancelled due to the Corona virus ( I saw Terciera had one case). I would like a refund since I paid double what my friends paid as a couple ($982.00 and my husband is in a nursing home; I don't know from day to day how his health will be in the future. email me a response at kdstonenow@gmail.com please.
You won't be going anywhere this year.Virus will keep spreading untill there is a vaccine. Your looking at 1 to 2 years.
"We are in the same situation. Were supposed to leave on April 3 with family. Same song and dance from Azores Getaways. They won't consider a refund, which should be a viable option for travellers and which I feel is beyond unfair. Our options now are a rebook by end of May, to be used by fall or a voucher which has to be used by November (our 1 year anniversary date from our original booking!!) This global crisis will not be back to normal in the next few months...unfortunately. Just give us our money back and be done with it. What they are doing seems illegal. I'm not done yet!"
I agree they continue to only offer voucher for travel valid up to December 2021. Who knows what things will look like then ? It’s not acceptable .
"Yeah, my family booked flights for June, but even if they lift restrictions, I know it won't be safe just yet. And my parents, who are supposed to be with us, are ages 79 and 80. :( I'm not sure what we should do..."
"As everyone else, we booked our fifth (and most expensive trip) through Azores Getaways for March 22. We paid close to $3000 for the two of us. Flights were of course cancelled. We are seniors and I cannot imagine traveling in next few months which is the only option they are giving us. I am fairly certain there are European laws which would require the airlines to give us a refund, but since we booked through Azores Getaways we have to go through them. If anyone has any success, please post. We would accept a voucher if it had a long-term expiration but this is ridiculous. This policy is going to really hurt them in the long-term, and travel to the Azores as a whole.If they do not come around warnings need to be widely posted."
"Please note, I haven't tried following this process myself. This is all just information I found after a few minutes of Googling. I'd ask that if anyone has anyone luck regarding Azores Getaways to please post updates as I'm scheduled to travel myself in June.I realize this doesn't address those who want to cancel their flights due to Covid-19 but rather those who have had their flights canceled but I hope it's some help.According to a Forbes article dated 4/6/20 called ""Airlines Must Issue CoronaVirus Cancellation Refunds, Says EU"", (link: https:/…47a427cf6371 )Regarding canceled flights:""Passengers across Europe are not being offered refunds by airlines which have cancelled flights due to Coronavirus. But today the European Commission said that such a refusal violates European Union law.“The airlines have to offer passengers a choice between a reimbursement or a rerouting,” said a Commission spokesperson. “Passenger rights are protected by law in the European Union.”According to the Commission spokesperson, “airlines have the option to offer vouchers instead of reimbursement, but passengers must agree to these vouchers”. The airlines must provide a refund instead of a voucher if the passenger requests it.Though the law is set at EU level, it is enforced at national level. Passengers with a grievance cannot take their complaint to the EU, they have to take it to their national government.Passengers who are not being given the option for a refund should call the airline’s customer service and cite EU Passenger Rights Law requiring a refund. The Commission has issued these guidelines for passengers to refer airlines to.If the airline still refuses, a passenger would have to take the issue to their national enforcement body.""There is a link in the article that refers to the guidelines put out by the European Commission to refer the airlines to. https:/…c20201830.pdfThe national enforcement body for Portugal appears to be Autoridade Nacional da Aviacao Civil (ANAC) and they do have a complaint form that you can fill out on their website after waiting 6 weeks for a response from the airline. Their contact info is here: https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transpo…The complaint link is here : https:/…FormulariodeReclamacao.aspx"
Thank you so much for this information.

"This is not an insurance issue. Azores Getaways will not issue refunds. You should therefore initiate a chargeback dispute with your credit card company for services not rendered by the provider. Vouchers only is not legal.Edited: 11:52 am, April 21, 2020 "
"Here is the reply I just received from Azores Getaways concerning my refund request for my cancelled trip. It appears that the airline is in violation of both US and EU regulations.""Thank you for your email. Please note that at the moment we are not able to provide a full refund to our customers since all the services involved, including the airline, are only allowing the postponing of the trip. You may confirm this information on the airline website.The package purchased from us was a special promotional deal that involves extremely restrictive fares from our partners that are nonrefundable.We realize that many customers may experience any number of unforeseen and last-minute mishaps, but unfortunately, our hands are often tied when it comes to the policies of the partners we work with. We assure you that Azores Getaways is not withholding or keeping any of the money paid out for the unused services. We realize that this was not the outcome you were hoping for, but we hope you understand our agency's position on these difficult matters. """
"Our group trip of 8 people (4 couples) was scheduled for June 3-13, 2020. Here is the reply I received today. What is your interpretation on if we can reschedule for June 2021? (tickets were purchased October 2019)""In your case, your travel package included an Azores Airlines or SATA Air Açores flight. Here are the options we’re able to provide:1. Free Flight Rebookingo The airline is allowing passengers to rebook their flights with new departure dates up until December 31, 2020, or within the validity of the ticket, whichever is earlier. (e.g. If your ticket was issued and sent to you upon purchasing on October 1, 2019, your ticket is only eligible for a new departure date up until October 1, 2020.) o To give customers time to make a decision about their new travel dates, they will be allowing re-bookings and ticket re-issuing until May 31, 2020. o We will do our best to secure the same prices for hotels and other land arrangements, but depending on the new travel dates, some extra fees may apply. 2. Flight Voucherso Alternatively, we are able to contact the airline on your behalf to request a voucher for the full value of your original flights. o This voucher can be used on future flights on any of the routes that SATA/Azores Airlines flies, and the voucher will be valid on new flight purchases for up to 1 year after the voucher emission date.(e.g. A voucher issued on March 24, 2020 must be used by March 24, 2021.) o In this case, we will also issue a voucher with the remaining amount of your travel package that you’ll be able to use on future purchases with our company, on any of our websites, valid for the same period.""Edited: 12:53 am, April 24, 2020 "
Thank you for the information!
"Here is their most recent reply. Btw, our trip was booked for May 20-29 and cancelled by them. Anyone else have better luck or any suggestions?""We are really sorry that you feel that we are not being flexible, however, at the moment we are not able to provide a full refund to our customers since all the services involved, including the airline, are only allowing the postponing of the trip. You may confirm this information on the airline website.The airlines are not obliged to refund passengers for flights cancelled due to the novel coronavirus or other reasons outside an airline’s control. The information that the airline has provided us is that current rules only require that the airline ensures passengers can complete their itineraries. If a flight is canceled for reasons outside an airline’s control, they only need to provide alternate arrangements, not a refund.According to the rules in Portugal, the passengers affected are entitled to a credit voucher or postponing their trips. You may confirm this information on our government website through this link: https:/…We hope you may understand our difficult position since in order to be able to refund our customers we need that all the providers involved allow the reimbursement of paid services. We can guarantee that Azores Getaways is not withholding or keeping any of the money paid out for the unused services. We are so sorry for this inconvenience and we really hope you accept our offer of a travel credit.As informed previously we providing our customers a travel credit to be used until the 31st of December of 2021, which means that you are able to also book dates of 2022. This travel credit will be made available in your ""Customer area"", and can be accessed by logging in with the email used in the original booking. This credit can be used as a form of payment on a new package, flight, hotel, car rental or experience on a date chosen by you.We realize that this was not the outcome you were hoping for, but we hope you understand our agency's position on these difficult matters.""Best regards,Rita SousaBooking Department"
"fyi, Here is one more reply from Azores Getaways (see below). It appears that what they are saying is that because we all booked travel through a ""travel and tourism agency"" that different rules apply to all of us. The EU regulations say that individuals who booked directly with airlines are entitled to a refund option. But the government of Portugal is saying that those of us who booked through a travel and tourism agency, like Azores Getaways, are not entitled to that option only the voucher/travel credit option. I guess we are all left with no other choice.""We hope this email finds you and your loved ones safe and healthy. As you know once a booking is made all services are immediately prepaid and confirmed. For that reason, any changes and/or cancelations are subject to our partner's rules and approvals.Given the public health emergency of international scope, declared by the World Health Organization on 30 January 2020, as well as the classification, on 11 March 2020, of the COVID-19 disease as a pandemic, the Government of Portugal has been approving a set of extraordinary and urgent measures in several matters. It states that:Travel organized by travel and tourism agencies scheduled for the period from 13 March 2020 to 30 September 2020, which are not carried out due to the pandemic entitles the traveler to:- obtain a voucher of equal value to the payment made, valid until 31 December 2021;- reschedule the trip until 31 December 2021.This decree-law establishes exceptional and temporary measures concerning tourism in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Kindly let us know if you agree with the issue of the vouchers, since this is the option that gives you more flexibility, you may even authorize a third party to use the amount on your behalf.Once again we are truly sorry for the situation and we understand it is a difficult position to be in, we hope that the situation may be resolved so that you may be able to travel in the near future!Best regardsVera CardosoBooking Department"""
"Has posted also on the other thread ""They should have added that this decree-law also says that ""The voucher referred to in paragraph a) If not used by December 31, 2021, the guest is entitled to a refund, to be made within 14 days."" and that ""in case of bankruptcy of the travel agency before someone has had the chance to use the voucher it will fall under the ""fundo de garantia de viagens e turismo"" (as for any situation of bankruptcy before Covid19,) number 5 of the decree-law"". Considering that they are evoking that decree-law I suppose that they are a portuguese travel agency."" and the link to the decree-law is on post#25"
"Time for Azores Getaways to clarify which legal jurisdiction they are invoking to avoid refunds. Time for lawyers to sharpen the class action knife to carve up these craven, unethical policies. SATA will be bankrupt before this is over. And ‘managed’ scrip vouchers will be worth 10 cents on the dollar.Agree to nothing with Azores Getaways, or Ideastation. Their May 31 deadline is completely arbitrary and consumer, political and legal pressures will increasingly mount for them to issue full refunds for services not delivered."
"Just curious but has anyone actually gotten a refund from Azores Getaways? If so, please share your story. Thanks."
"Nope. Just being continually stonewalled. Now the European Commission will sue the countries that don’t obey their own laws.In other words, under EC Regulation 261, a full refund is required.ttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-travel-refunds/eu-opens-legal-cases-against-countries-over-travel-refunds-idUSKBN22P1KRWe continue to urge Azores Getaways to refund the full cost of cancelled services, thereby observing governing law and practice, and maintaining trusted status with Canadian and U.S. travellers."
"I'm also being stonewalled. Azores Getaways are stating that that vouchers or re-bookings are the only options being offered by Azores Airlines. I've also contacted Azores Airlines directly and they have stated that these are the options being given despite my requesting a refund and quoting the relevant EU regulations.In an email I also asked Azores Getaways what happen if we do not pick one of these two options by the deadline that they stated of May 31, 2020? Their response was:""If no option is selected that your booking will follow the normal rules for the ticket you have acquired and any changes or/credits will be according to the regulamentations. This means that any changes without penalty will no longer be allowed using the waiver in place.""At this point, Azores Airlines is in violation of EU law and US law (if your flight originated or ends in the US) https:/…202020_0.pdf however add in the recent Portuguese decree law (Decreto-Lei n.º 17/2020) https:/… stating that these are the two options to be offered (and that we aren't entitled to a refund unless we don't use the vouchers by December 2021/or are unemployed), it will probably take a few years to sort out in the various courts. If Azores Airlines responds back with the same two options and ignore my request again, at this point I plan to file a DOT complaint, a complaint with ANAC ( Autoridade Nacional da Aviação Civil ) and probably start a charge back with my credit card. I don't feel that Azores Getaways should suffer because Azores Airlines is not following EU and US law but at this point I can't think of anything else to try. The amount of money that lawyers will be making off this crisis in the coming years will be astronomical.If anyone has better luck, please tell us!Edited: 6:23 pm, May 16, 2020 "
"Adores Getaways seem intent on blowing up their business with North Americans. No one will provide answers as to whether the voucher value will be protected i.e. Will the reservation at my $200 hotel now be priced at $400? SATA is almost certain to declare itself insolvent. If their website is any indication, it’s no wonder. What happens to my airline voucher then? As a senior, what if circumstance - e.g. health - precludes your being able to travel to the Azores within the time limit, or ever? Will my ‘vouchers’ be refunded? Will obscene ‘service’ charges be applied?This whole voucher scheme is licensed (by government) larceny - violation of their own laws to steal people’s money outright. Ask anyone if they’ll ever book anything with these shysters again."
"Just got this yesterday. Our family has a trip in late August. Hope you have been able to find resolution and answers for your trips too. - FlightsTAP Air Portugal will resume nonstop flights between Lisbon and Newark airport in the United States, sticking to a temporary schedule of two flights per week with additional connections from Boston, Miami and Toronto rolling out over the next few weeks.TAP Air Portugal plans to debut 3 new North American routes in July, including: Boston and Toronto to the Azores, and Montreal to Lisbon. TAP has made some safety adjustments, including: Requiring customers to wear masks; Asking customers to remain seated as much as possible; Disinfecting pillows and blankets before distributing them on-board; and limiting meal services.International SATA Azores Airlines flights between the Azores and Boston, Toronto, Cape Verde and Frankfurt will remain suspended until June 30, 2020.Inter-island flights between the 9 islands of the Azores have resumed on SATA Air Açores as of May 29, 2020."
My concern is that this company will go under and no voucher will be protected.
"Not a word from Azores Getaways regarding credits and vouchers. In fact, completely incommunicado for some weeks now. Has anyone received a voucher? Or bankrupt already?"
"Trip for May 23-30 cancelled because of Virus. After repeated emails without any answer finally gotpromises after a phone call, after repeated attempts finally got someone to answer, but nothing in writing re vouchers covering flights, lodging in car. We'll see."
"Have received a $5000 CAD voucher from Azores Getaways good for next year. Could be used on trips to Portugal, which is open now the Canadians I think. But Azores requires COVID testing and a day quarantine (which is where we wanted to go)."
"But Azores requires COVID testing and a day quarantine - the rule is that you can bring the negative Covid test with you, you don't have to do it in Azores, that's only for those arriving without a negative test. And if you do the test there at arrival your duty is to self-isolate for as long as the result takes to arrive, now that's about 48h. ""From the 15th of June 2020 on, when you land you will be given a form that you have to fill in and sign. On that form you can choose one of several options:The first is you have already been tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus on the 72 hours preceding your flight to the Azores and the result was negative. In this case you will have to show the physical document issued by a lab that proves that the test for SARS-CoV-2 has been performed within the 72 hours before your departure from the origin airport. That document should contain your identification, the lab where the test was performed, the date of the test, the signature of the people who performed the test, and the NEGATIVE result. If the stay will be longer than seven days, the passenger should, on the 6th day from the date SARS-CoV-2 test was performed, contact the health services of the county where you are staying so that another test can be performed by the Health Authorities that will inform you of the result.Alternatively, you can choose the second option: This option consists of starting the procedures to perform the SARS-CoV-2 test as soon as you land. For that, the professionals of the Health Authorities at the airport will need to collect biological samples so that they may perform the SARS-CoV-2 test. After the test has been performed, you must stay in prophylactic isolation at your home or place where you arestaying until you get the results of the test. In this case and if the stay will be longer than seven days, the passenger should, on the 6th day from the date SARS-CoV-2 test was performed, contact the health services of the district where you are staying so that another test can be performed by the Health Authorities that will inform you of the result."" https:/…AAs_20200615_VF.pdf"
"I asked for a refund, was told they could offer credit until Feb 2021. I’m not happy with that as I doubt the pandemic will be any better by then! Does anyone know if a class action suit is started? This is so wrong!"
"Curious, did you all get refunds due to Covid couldn't fly? Or get a credit for next year?Just booked for May 2021. Hopefully flying to Europe then."
