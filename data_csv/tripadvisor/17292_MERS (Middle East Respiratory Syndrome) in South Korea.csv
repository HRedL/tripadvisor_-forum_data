"Hi Travellers! I will be visiting South Korea in July but there is currently a disease outbreak in Korea called MERS , so I was just wondering is it worth it taking a risk to visit South Korea? Or should I wait until the outbreak gets under control? Much appreciate any responses.. Keep travelling!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Lol... Outbreak... Stop watching the news... Life goes on here in Seoul as normal... I lived in Toronto during SARS... Same thing... News made it seem worse than it was. Sooner of my Korean friends don't even know about MERS. Is not even reported in the local news as it's not serious... 11 people (who are quarantined) out of 52,000,000! You have a better chance of crashing in the plane on the way over here than catching MERS."

Yup it's safe... Those isolated are not out in the streets infecting others... Those isolated are the only ones who are at risk... Or you if you go visit the hospital where they are located... Do some research... Look at the SARS outbreak in Toronto... Same thing happened there... Media made it sound worse than it was. No one OUTSIDE of those originally quarantined died.Edited: 5 years ago 
"Whether it's Kim Jong Eun or MERS, I always say to people ""if it scares you don't travel"". Doesn't matter how safe it really is, if you are worried, you won't enjoy your stay."
"Oh, and by the way, I'm getting ready to fly now. I have no qualms about traveling to Seoul and on to Changwon"
"Hey, I have read into the MERS disease a bit further, which I came to the conclusion that if you don't get in contact with those who have already contracted the disease you are safe. But I will still be wearing a musk while I am there just for precaution measure :). Thanks for your reply."
"We're due to arrive in Seoul on July 1... just keeping watch at the moment. I'm thinking at this stage I'll let the Oz governments smarttraveller be my guide, if they upgrade to ""reconsider"" then I'll reconsider. Out of our three destinations, Seoul is the one I'm looking forward to the most! I'd be disappointed, but we could always go another time. But for right now, plans are staying in place!I actually know someone who did get SARS in Toronto. He didn't die (thankfully!) but he was extremely sick and unable to work for approx two years. It had a huge impact on his family, he was the breadwinner for a wife and five kids."
"I also have plans to travel to Seoul for 3 weeks and am now considering if it is worth it. Everyone I know who are living in Seoul now have to wear mask everywhere they go, and 200 schools were closed for the moment. It seems quite serious. Whether the media actually blew up the matter or not, it is a large health risk that I'm not sure if I'm willing to take, no matter how long I've been waiting to take this trip.I'm waiting for more updates on the situation. In the meantime, safe travel everyone!"
On a 1 to 10 scale how big of a travel alert would you give this incident
It's of no concern to me.
"who.int/mediacentre/…This is the situation as of time of posting. Check the home page for latest updates if reading this much later.Worth reading in full, but I'll just pull this bit out:WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.Edited: 5 years ago "

I live here and I give it a ONE as a threat... you cannot catch it unless you touch someone... It's not airborne... People here are reacting too much... Those infected are isolated... Those isolated are in quarantine... How can you catch it?
"We are from Busan, but also reside in Australian part-time. My husband is currently in South Korea. I was suppose to return at the end of June with my two young daughters. We have decided it is best to sit Australia. My husband is Korean and has a very low opinion of information that comes from the government. My advice is if you don't feel comfortable with the situation then don't go!"
I live in Busan & have friends throughout Korea. At least 1300 people are being quarantined & the government is with holding a lot of information such as where people who contacted the virus are from. I think the next two weeks will determine whether or not the virus has been contained. As of now I think most of the Reported cases have been from up north. Mers has a 40% death rate so if it get more serious I probably wouldn't visit here....
Agree!!!
"Its a poorly understood disease process. Many of you think you may know what it is and many of you don't. There is no evidence where whether this viral infection is airborne, contact, or droplet. (It's the same with Ebola, in which no one even knows). Again it is all just hype but you cannot ignore it. The media likes to always do that. I am also going to Seoul in the middle of July and I'm glad to know that those living in Seoul are still continuing on with their lives. I am a registered nurse in the large hub of San Francisco in the ER and so tourists come to us all the time. No one took precautions for Ebola (except healthcare workers) and those who were ""infected"" were mainly health care workers. I'm not trying to downplay the seriousness of this but at the same time, the fact that Seoul closed down 200+ schools seems a bit alarming, as well as the tours form Taiwan and China diverting their tours to other Asian countries. @TravAus, thanks for that link, I'll definitely keep checking that link out. Currently, according to the CDC, it's ""Level 1: Watch for MERS-CoV "" Usual baseline risk or slightly above baseline risk for destination and limited impact to the traveler. I would say just to make sure you wash your hands thoroughly and frequently (that there is essentially how anything spreads)"
"I agree @Travis T, health authorities do not yet know how it is transmitted, so one cannot say it is not airborne. Best to get your information from the likes of WHO, CDC, etc. Some of the victims were only on the same ward as the index patient (not the same room), and some were only the ward for five minutes. They don't know how it is transmitted. There have been some tertiary patients, ie zero exposure to the index patient, but had exposure to secondary patients exposed to the first. So it does have the potential to spread quite quickly if not contained. I think they were right to close schools until they know more. I also think it's reasonable that people do take it seriously into consideration, and seek out further info, when deciding whether to visit.My travel is three weeks away, so personally I am ""alert but not alarmed"". It's just a wait and see for me atm.Edited: 5 years ago "
">>(It's the same with Ebola, in which no one even knows).<<No, they know how Ebola's transmitted; what they don't know is what the vector is. They're thinking bats but they don't know for sure."
"My trip is just around 1 week away and my friends and I are still going as planned until we received travel advisories from WHO or governments to do otherwise.We have been thru' SARS and had learned the various tips to keep the risk low. Just as some, we will remain alert, but definitely not alarmed at the moment.Right now we just wished that the worst is over and all the patients speedy recovery."
"I have a trip planned to Seoul for 3 days next week. I am then flying from Seoul to Shanghai, where I will pick up my luggage and then fly to London within 24hrs. I am not concerned about catching the disease, but I am worried that China will quarantine me, or not allow me to leave the airport to pick up my luggage. Is this a problem big enough that it's worth cancelling my trip? I think the Chinese government can be unpredictable and strict about these kinds of things, which worries me.Wasting money on my non-refundable tickets is one of my main concerns. But if a travel warning is put up, I think perhaps my travel insurance can cover it?"
I'm leaving for Seoul on the 10th...should I be worried about getting Mers?? Or any way to prevent getting it??
Im Still Waiting for others information.. next week im going to go to seoul
"People stop being scared... You can't catch something from people who are NOT INFECTED... those infected or in contact with those infected are quarantined... STOP watching the news and get your info info the CDC OR WHO... There ARE NO CASES OF PEOPLE CONTRACTING MERS IN PUBLIC only new cases from those exposed to the original 14. And all those new cases were in quarantine. I live here and an not worried at all. The overreaction by locals is just that... Overreaction... Last year CNN was saying weeping ALL be dead from Ebola... What happened? Nothing... I lived in Toronto during SARS and nothing happened there either. Ad for travelling through Korea to China... Just answer the tourist question and you will be fine... My peer may got back from Hong Kong and was screened with all passengers by heat scanner. MERS IS NOT AIRBORNE as per the CDC AND WHO website... I have no idea who told you ""they don't know how is transmitted"" No one in Seoul is being forced to start a mask (and it does little to do the spread of disease) schools are closed as an overreaction by parents and only 200 out of 20,000. These are the facts from someone who LIVES in Seoul... Stop feeding the frenzy and paranoia.Edited: 5 years ago "
"I am in Seoul now, going to China tomorrow. There is a slight chance that they do a temperature check at immigration, but that is all.I will keep you posted."
"Hi,I am in Seoul now with my family with 2 boys age 4 & 11. We just try to take extra precaution by wearing masks & bring hand sanitizers since everyone back home whatsapp us asking abt MERS. Nothing unusual happens here. Just make sure u are fully hydrated when ur here & take vitamins . Just remember that death is beyond our control & dont let this spoil yr holiday.Cheers :)"
Glad to hear updates from you guys in Seoul! I'll be visiting Seoul next week. Hopefully the situation is under control and no more new cases! Stay safe everyone! * finger crossed*
Please keep us posted. Thanks
"Same here. Will be in Seoul next week. I've been reading the news and watching CNN and even if the number of MERS patients are increasing and 4 confirmed dead, I think I'm still pushing through my travel plans unless I hear any travel advisory from WHO or the government. Hopefully the situation will not worsen."
"This thread has been helpful. Thank you for the WHO link, will keep on checking it.I have a connecting flight at Incheon airport early July..I'm undecided if I should refund my ticket and fly with a different airline. Anyway, will keep watch for updates and travel advisory.Vitamins + updated flu shot + strong immune system and proper hygiene would be helpful, I guess."
"i have another concern though, if my flight is from Incheon and I'll be arriving at JFK. Would JFK airport impose stricter rules (quarantine etc.) upon arriving?"
"Quarantine you simply because you did visit korea? If this is the rationale, then the US would be quarantining thousands of travellers daily coming or passing thru Seoul. Even with the heights of Ebola, there was no mass quarantine measured implemented. Just specific targetted measures- eg. having high temperatures, obviously coughing/sneezing."
"I think it's unrealistic that any country would be quarantining plane loads of people, I think if they have any screening processes in place due to MERS then they would only quarantine people showing symptoms (fever, etc). I hear some airports (such as Incheon) are using heat scanners to detect fever."
"Heat scanners are common and have been around in almost all Asian airports for many years. I came back from Paris this week with a cold I caught in Paris, those heat scanners made me nervous, I also did my best to keep my coughs to extreme minimum, afraid they may kick me off the plane or put me away into quarantine."
"Thanks bigwawao, TravAus and macbcmini...I think I used the wrong term..it should have been screening process. Felt a little bit of my paranoia went away."
"I have cancelled my trip to Korea(include Seoul, Busan, Jeju). Because more infected patients have been confirmed today.The very important thing to me is local people don't think the MERS is a big thing. They even don't know how to prevent it and protect yourselves. Everything seems peacefully as usual. But we all know SARS, and the reason why SARS spreaded in a such quick speed. Maybe that's why the virus outbreaks in Korea.So I do think we travelers should respect ourselves, respect our family members."
"I'm sorry to hear that tianrui007, certainly if it makes you uncomfortable then you have made the right decision."
Thank you. I would go Korea when things get better.
"I'll be travelling to Korea this week, but i'm still confused. I really want to go. I live in Indonesia but no one knows about MERS happening in Korea right now.but My family in taiwan keep telling me to cancel my trip.They said that taiwan news reported like it's really severe in korea and most people refund/ cancel their trips to korea. My friend's a student in korea. I ask her about the situation there. She said that it's not really bad and most people in seoul not wearing any mask. Is there anyone travelling in korea now after the news of MERS?? and if you're there, how's the situation there? Thanks :)"
"I was suppose to be traveling to Seoul for study abroad on June 10th, and I wasn't actually all that concerned with getting sick. It's just I feel bad for my mother who is worried about the MERS ""outbreak"" although I keep updating her on the situation and how those who have passed were old and already had diseases. What you yall think will it get better in a week or two?"
"What's making it worse, are the Korean people. They overact which is causing this situation a lot worse than it is. They will suffer substantially with lost tourism, sales, etc."
"So far all cases (87, I've just read) are connected to the hospitals where the first patients were treated. So it's not currently ""in the community"" so to speak, ie no one has caught it from someone on the subway, or anything like that. If they can continue to contain it, then I think the chances of any of us catching it are basically zero. If it does spread to the community, I would definitely reconsider, even if only for the reason I'd be a bit nervous and jumpy, if someone sneezes or coughs near me I might panic!And yes, the people who have died had underlying conditions.I'm still watching and waiting, we're due there July 1."
"Good points to realize that this ""outbreak"" is contained to the quarantined persons... Also the hospitals and area affected is 200 kms away from Seoul."
Is it still safe to visit their jjimjilbang? I'm traveling there this week.
"I just arrived in Seoul and staying in Doksan. While in the taxi and checking out the people I passed by, there were very very few wearing masks. I guess only when you are inside closed spaces e.g metro, bus, airplanes where you take precautions as I saw more people wearing masks in Jeju airport before heading to Seoul (few still wearing them in Gimpo airport). Life goes on in Seoul!"
Hey GuysMy family and I are planning on travelling to Seoul from the USA on 6/11. It's been 6 months planning in the making and the kids (20 and 13) are so excited to go....we are still planning on going forward unless the USA or WHO issues some type of travel restriction.
Let us know the status when you get back.
"Like many Asian countries, almost everywhere you go you will see someone wearing masks. The media is definitely making it worst than it is. About 2300 quarantined (or self-quarantined).. doesn't exactly mean 2300 have it. It's a precautionary step to avoid a outbreak (ie. the doctor who attended the symposium). TravAus said it, there's only 87 actual cases. The 6 victims of MERS all had underlying conditions (COPD, asthma, immunocompromised r/t old age) and so the elder and the young are more prone to infections. My trip is July 19-28 and right now I'm still going. For those who are there now/going there. Keep us updated! Also... ALWAYS wash your hands and don't touch your face. Washing hands/Hand Sanitizer is probably the best way to prevent infection.Edited: 5 years ago "
"First, I love Korea and I think tourists will be fine. But it is totally irresponsible to say it is not a big deal, or media or Koreans overreacting to this health crisis. It is extremely serious, with 1,000 schools closed, 87 confirmed cases, thousands quarantined, it is no joking matter, Korean government rightfully so went into extreme crisis mode to manage the crisis, without such actions, MERS will cause serious damages to Korea in many aspects, not just health, image and economy. How can anyone in their right mind say ONLY 87 CONFIRMED CASES!? Only? How many confirmed MERS in USA or Australia? 87 is a lot.In comparison, Singapore tourists or 2,000+ canceled tour groups are trivia, irrelevant and inconsequential.Tourists often are self-centered, they think the world evolves around them. MERS is serious health problem not only for Korea, but for the world, everybody is watching, least of which is for tourism."
"I think it is serious .. it amazes me that from just one man traveling, there are now 95 sick and seven dead in a matter of a couple of weeks. Hong Kong has just updated it's travel alert to ""serious"". http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/index.html"
"I have planned to visit in September but may have to cancel and visit HK instead. I was looking forward to it and seems like whenever I visit somewhere, something always goes on. FML....."
We are actually going to Korea for 10 days and going to Hong Kong on the final leg of our trip before returning to the States. I wonder if HK will impose any type of special entry procedures for those that traveled to Korea...
We are also going to Hong Kong after Seoul.
"In comparison, there are only 2 imported MERS cases in the entire U.S. If there are 87 cases in the U.S., the whole US will freak out, that is how serious it is."
"scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/a…We have been advised to AVOID ""non-essential"" travel.All tour groups to Korea in this month have been cancelled. After SARS in 2003, as a resident in Hong Kong, we really do not want to go through anything like that again. It only took ONE man in an elevator to spread widely.I am not sure how much real ""update"" we are getting from Korea, for now, we are playing it ""safe"" than ""sorry"". I hope Korea gets over this and this situation gets under control asap. Korea is a VERY popular tourist destination , especially from Hong Kong ! All the best."
I hope they get a handle on it quickly.
"Well frankly whether US freaks out is irrelevant on the world stage. In the UK we are amazed by the timidity of those over the pond.Turning to MERS, yes it is serious. Yes you should consider if your journey will be spoiled by YOUR fear. But YOUR danger is tiny, you are more likely to crash your car than you are to contract MERS."
"The first reply was only one week ago, he said LOL, Laugh Out Loud! Only 11 cases, now it is 8 times more, I doubt officials are laughing out loud. I am sure Korea will manage it well and get over it in due time, but LOL AND COME ON OVER is childish and silly. We are lucky he is not running the government."
"If you took a moment to realize the truth and not the hype of the situation... Yes there are almost 100 cases now... But ALL THE NEW CASES are from those quarantined... No one has been infected in the community. Yes people died, those people were already very sick and in the hospital with other illnesses. I was trying to point out how funny it was that all the paranoia over something that is not in the public sphere... I live here and I'm not worried about it nore is a majority of the population... Now if you wish to believe the fear mongering media then go ahead but it's irrational when you research the truth and look at the situation objectively.Edited: 5 years ago "
"My concern is and remains mass transit. My understanding is that the ""quarantine"" is voluntary. My fear is that economically disadvantaged people, people that cannot afford to miss work and appointments, may risk breaking the quarantine out of necessity. These people will not be in cabs, they'll be on the metro and buses.I don't want to be paranoid every time someone sneezes, coughs or clears their throat. Going to Seoul and taking cabs everywhere seems elitist and misses the point of immersing oneself in the local culture. I am certainly not picking on the poor but there is an economic reality in these situations that cannot be ignored. For now, I will watch and wait and hope for the best."
"I think it is important to keep perspective. Yes I agree it is serious. I also agree there's no need to panic. If the figures I've read are correct, SARS killed 744 people. In that same year, influenza killed 500,000 people."
"Yes! However, the flu isn't a sexy/dangerous sounding disease that can rile up people and sell magazines and internet clicks."
The ministry of health is monitoring those quarantined at government facilities to ensure that they remain quarantined. AGAIN NOTE THIS... NO ONE HAS BEEN INFECTED OUTSIDE OF A HOSPITAL. Unless you plan on sleeping next to an infected/quarantined person you have a better chance of dying in the plane on your way to Seoul than catching MERS.Edited: 5 years ago 
"Exactly!!Email update this morning from our travel advisory and no warnings have been issued for us. I actually feel a lot better since looking up influenza statistics too, a common illness we don't give much thought to. Just in my country alone (Australia, pop. 23 million) 3500 people die from influenza every year. While I get my shots, I don't walk around worrying about influenza. I've never personally known anyone who has died from influenza. I've never, to my knowledge, known anyone who's known anyone who's died from influenza. So I could go, and have terribly bad 1-in-a-billion chance luck and get MERS. Or I could change our plans and go to Hanoi ... and get hit by a bus. Or I could cancel, stay home, never leave the house for fear of crashing my car on the way to the supermarket, and die overnight in a house fire when the smoke alarms fail.Or I could go to Korea, eat lots of kimchi, have a grand old time, and be totally fine. :)So, I feel comfortable now in my decision to go IF nothing else changes and my government issues no travel warnings.. I really do feel like the risk is minimal and no greater than the myriad of ways I could die on a daily basis, and agree that the plane ride will be scarier!"
Latest news... Should be NO NEW INFECTIONS after Friday... dailyherald.com/article/…306099957
Good to hear. I don't want to visit if many businesses are closed or people are paranoid. It won't seem like a vacation.
"""Latest news... Should be NO NEW INFECTIONS after Friday...""Well, what the actual news says is that ""The maximum incubation period for THOSE INFECTED BY THE SECOND ""SUPER-SPREADER"" ends around this Friday, experts said, which RAISES HOPES that the outbreak COULD weaken soon.and then:""I CAUTIOUSLY PREDICT (MERS) will peak today"" and be stabilized in the next few days, Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo told lawmakers Monday."
If it was running rampant do you really think airlines would still be flying there or that the borders would be open?
"Airlines, hotels and borders were open during SARS. They will contain MERS, but only if everybody take it extremely seriously. The first step in crisis management is to judge how serious is the problem, then you manage the crisis with the right amount of attention, the earliest moment often proved to be most critical. Same for personal, business, educational or transit, ferry problem or crisis. It is counterproductive to make light of it."
"Hi I arrived in Seoul today 10 June. It seems like nothing has happened! Some Koreans do wear masks but not all. Malls n touristy areas have lesser crowds. That's about it. Before I came I was contemplating should I come or not?? Luckily i did not cancel my air ticket. As long as you wear a mask, don't visit hospitals, you should be safe."
Thanks for the update SingaporeGingy!
"I really wouldn't risk it to be honest. It might only be a few cases, but it is still spreading because no one is following quarantine protocol including the doctors who are treating the patients. We already have 560 people in quarantine here in Changwon and regardless of schools closing or not, it is affecting patients and doctors. And still spreading."
The good thing is that nowhere is crowded any more. Lots of great places to go without the crowds! I would take advantage of this time to go to places like Lotte World and shopping malls.
"I came to Seoul on June 10, was very worried about the MERS situation. Having sleepless nights if I should cancel my booking or not. BUT we decided to come.After 2days of observations, the Koreans are living pretty normal daily lives just like us in our country. Less crowds in tourist areas now, palaces, namsan tower, only afew passengers in the hop on n off bus, which I feel is good .If are are taking public transport, visiting crowded places such as shopping malls or at supermarket put on your mask. And you should be pretty safe. Everyone should be worried about this epidemic going on. But the situation Seoul is not as scary as eveyone is thinking of. Just be more careful thats all.."
"Saya & 8 teman juga akan berangkat tgl 24/6 - 5/7, KL - Busan - Jeju - Seoul. Confused neh... Dik Nora berangkat tgl berapa?"
Thanks for your feedback. I'm still hesitating whether should I still proceed.
Please keep us posted. We will still be going on the 16th but keep thinking on MERS.
"Sebenarnya berangkat tgl 15/6 tapi udah ku cancel kak Debbie. Soalnya indonesia udah keluar travel advise, dan negara lain juga uda Red Alert . Kalau jadi berangkat hati-hati kak. Ingat pake masker dan jangan dekat-dekat rumah sakit"

Cindy S... Your post is misleading... WHERE IS IT SPREADING? NOT IN PUBLIC BUT IN THOSE QUARANTINED! There had YET to be ANYONE infected that was NOT in quarantine... Please stop misleading... Yes a few people have broken quarantine but still no public infection... schools are closed due to overreaction. FYI today Friday June 12 over 1500 people in quarantine will be released as they are negative for infection... Over the next 5 days that number will increase as those passing the 14 day quarantine period are cleared... I don't see how this is SPREADING?Edited: 5 years ago

"The good news is Korea is famous now, today 3 people mentioned Korea to me, including my barber, these are people who never been to and never will go to Korea, maybe can't find Korea on a map. Driving home, I just heard news about Korea and MERS. I told them, no big deal, only 100 people sick, schools closed, 1,000s quarantined, local people are all laughing out loud, no worry, everything is normal and happy. Come play now. Only stupid ignorant foreigners worry about it."
"Hi All, we arrived in Seoul on the 8th June. We flew from UK to Hong Kong on 4th and our travel plan was UK-HK-SK-HK-UK. After the news broke about the MERS outbreak we deliberated for a few hours whether to continue our trip to Seoul but after checking the UK Gov site and WHO and on the information that new cases had been in direct contact with infected patients, thus we decided to continue. If we had cancelled monetary loss would have been about GBP 200 for flights and hotels. On arrival at Seoul airport we had to fill in a medical questionnaire to hand in but did not encounter any delay, must say though there were many passengers wearing masks at passport control. We have spent 3 wonderful days in Seoul and now sitting on the KTX express train to Busan. During the day out and about enjoying and exploring we have forgotten about the outbreak, to be honest not many people wearing masks at all, have seen at most may be 3 or 4 on different MTR carriages, but once at the hotel watching TV we are again reminded by the news BBC and CNN. We are slightly worried about the travel alerts now issued by various governments and are hoping that we will not have any problem returning to Hong Kong as there are new cases there. We are a couple in our 60s who love travelling, we do have the option to cut short our trip and fly out now but have made an informed decision to continue, we hope it is the right one but we cannot see into the future and the time to leave will be when we enjoy less and worry more and that is certainly not the case at present."
"Ok, thx"
"Confirmed cases increased to 122, death 9, 4 cured, 2700 schools closed, 3400 quarantined, 70,000 tourists canceled in June. HK tested 33 suspected cases, 17 cleared, 16 pending, 32 visited Korea recently."
"Thanks for the info u gave us, it would be good if you continue updating here , in particular Im intersted to know which kind of test you encounter at ur arrival in HK , and in Gb .I planned fly in Seoul June 28, Im not afraid to catch the virus , but the friend that should acompany me , is living in Sweden , and is concerned about his arival in Stokolm , he fear be put in quarantine. Excuse me for my english , not exacly the Queen's english !"
"I read it in newspaper last night, not a subject I follow intensively, locals are not forthcoming with data, only kept on saying everything is great, laughing out loud. They all know more but not saying. I dont think they really care about losing tourists, maybe just a matter of mistaken pride.For tourists, the main worry is not catching MERS, but when you go home or elsewhere, if they know you went to Korea. It is much easier to catch a cold, which I did in Paris last week, how will you be treated? As HK is really freaking out about this, a lot of rumors flying around.There is also the question of social responsibility and patriotism, what burden will you cause your homeland if you come home with a cold or MERS. Seem selfish to put your country in such risk just for your personal pleasure."
"126 confirmed cases, 11 death, 3680 quarantined, 55 hospitals with cases, including Seoul, Samsung Seoul hospital has most cases."
"I respectfully disagree macbcmini, the WHO and my government (Australia) do not recommend any travel restrictions at all. If they did, I'd be listening. I am subscribed to my governments travel advisory, I get email updates for the countries I've chosen anytime a situation changes or a warning is issued. and it is at the bottom level, not even an ""excercise high caution"", but just normal everyday cautions apply. There are no warnings for South Korea. There are plane loads of people from SK landing each day in cities all around the world. I don't believe it would be socially irresponsible or unpatriotic to travel to SK right now. If my government didn't want me to go, they would upgrade to a travel warning. smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/…South_KoreaI understand Hong Kongs position due to their experience with SARS. Whether a threat is real or perceived, it can have a huge economic impact which can take years to recover. Reports say Hong Kong was a virtual ghost town during SARS, and I can understand their harsh measures. Their stance however doesn't actually make MERS more of a threat to you or me than it actually is.The WHO has consistently stated that schools should not be closed. The closures are more about appeasing public fears.Yes one could end up in quarantine, and that is probably the biggest concern right now. But at the same time, one can't stay home because of all the myriad of things that ""might"" happen. We would never travel at all!I believe people here are making sensible, informed decisions that are right for them, whether they are choosing to stay or go. It is for each person to decide what they are comfortable with. And I don't think people are making those decisions lightly or without care.Latest update from WHO who.int/csr/don/12-june-2015-mers-korea/en/"
"Sure, I will try and update on our return flight to HK on19th and to GB on 22nd. We did not take our decision lightly and certainly do not make light of a potentially life threatening disease. Everyone will be guided by different factors and what is most important to them when making their decision. For us we now have to think on our return to GB should we hug and kiss our grandchildren or my elderly mother or will we wait 14 days before seeing them. We will probably not have very close contact and act the same as when we normally have a cold or cough at home.As to Busan, the hotel has signs printed in many locations in English giving full explanation of MERS, symptoms and action to take. There are hand sanitisers at hotel receptions and also banks we visited in Seoul. We have eaten some street food last night that has been cooked in front of us, tempura and doughnuts. We are trying to be vigilant and practising hygiene safety as much as possible.We hope the situation improves in the very near future."

"14 death, 3 more, 138 confirmed cases, 12 more."
"Based on Fox News, ""It has been occurring among hospital patients, visiting family members and medical staff.""I wouldn't be worried."
"We will travel to Korea tomorrow, with our three boys. Due to the worries of the situation our relatives will pick us up at Incheon and take us down to Kwnagju directly. It seems like theres alot of worries about MERS among Koreans but the information from Swedish embassy makes me feel quite calm. So we decided to go based on the facts. Information from Swedish embassy site:Subject MERSSince the first case of MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ) was found in South Korea 20 May, however 145 people have fallen ill with the disease. All of these have been infected in one of five hospitals in Seoul and the neighboring province of Gyeonggi . So far, fourteen people died. All of them except one have been in the 70-80 years old , and all had other diseases , which has given them an impaired state .Approximately 4,850 people have been quarantined , mainly in the home. More than 1,200 have been released from quarantine and be healthy .The South Korean authorities now believe that the situation has somewhat under control and has not issued any restrictions on travel to the country. As a preventive measure, kindergartens and schools in areas near the current hospitals closed, during this week . It also stresses that mortality in the MERS is not significantly higher than is the case with ordinary flu types ."
"we booked tickets and hotel to Seoul early August (travel with 2 little kids 4 and 6). Still watching the situation closely and wondering if anyone is planning to cancel their trip in early August ? We may loose our money (both air and hotel) as we bought these with good deals and no refundable terms...Like alot of people here mentioned, the fear is not too much about getting infected but the atmosphere of the vacation (quiet Seoul city as well as the constant fear within traveler them self) and quarantine potential issues...Please keep this thread updated.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Arrived Seoul yesterday after a short stay in Incheon. Seems like business as usual/life as usual. Few people wearing masks....but doesn't seem out of the ordinary for other Asian cities I travel. Wife and 2 kids with us....all of us are fairly low key and aren't really worrying.The positive in this? We are washing our hands maybe more than usual - cognizant not to touch our faces, rub eyes, etc....basically all the things we SHOULD be doing all the time!Korean BBQ last night was delicious! On our way to Myeongdong today for shopping and some snacks."
"Hi, arrived in Seoul yesterday. Traveled from London to Incheon via Dubai. We were issued with a health questionnaire relating to MERS and as soon as you came out of the plane you had to pass through a temporary counter where they checked your temperature. I am assuming this is because we were on a flight from Dubai. Possibly about a third of the passengers had their mask on prior to disembarking and within the airport may be about the same percentage or slightly less with masks on. Took the airport limousine bus to the hotel (near Coex) and didn't really notice many people with masks on on the way. Everyone seem to be going about their normal day to day business. I was slightly nervous about making this trip when the MERS issue first started but having been here, although it is a serious problem if you are affected, the chances of the general public getting affected are pretty low. Also read in the paper this morning that most of the schools will be re-opened from today. They expect to see more cases but so far all cases are related to a few hospitals and one in particular, Samsung Medical Centre in Seoul, where they had about 66 cases, according to the Korea Joongang Daily. Summary of the report from WHO states that the main reasons for the spread could be down to ""overcrowding in emergency rooms and having many patients in a single hospital room, particular habits and customs like doctor shopping as well as the custom of many friends and family visiting and taking care of patients"".Hope this helps if you have plans to visit Seoul in the very near future."
"Actually it depends on yourself & the fear you have.I just came back from Seoul & nothing seems fearful & all locals are living their live normally.Not many wore mask in crowded places, even the toddlers we saw on board the train or subway did not wear mask.So, it depends on whether you are fearful or not & if possible, for the sake of your family & friends/colleagues, go after the whole case subsided. As I am now facing some colleagues being so fearful & did not dare to walk by me! & It is so sickening seeing these ppl behaved this manner."
"Thanks very much for the updates, it is much appreciated!Has anyone been to Hongdae/Hongik University Street? Is it still busy with street performers, etc?"
"Thank you all for the updates and advice on keeping safe and practice hygiene at all times.I have been following closely the news on MERS as I intend to keep my holiday plan arriving at SK on July 3. Like all travelers, I will be cautious of places to visit and keep myself up-to-date with the latest news.TQ."
"Hi,We r due to arrive July 1 too but we r still monitoring the MERS situation. Daughter not well now but we can't cancelled the flight tickets so might make hotels booking last minute otherwise will b forfeited. Would appreciate anyone know Any latest update pls post here. Tq.SLMelb, Australia"
"In reply to the question about Hongdae, I was just there today and it's still very busy. I didn't go to the performance area but I was there last week and watched three university students performing. All is well and normal here!"
"I have a question for those who have just flown in and out of Korea. How were things once you returned from Korea (or landed in a new destination after going to Korea)? I live in Busan right now, and my parents are coming to visit in mid-July. Along with coming to Korea, we plan on taking a side trips to Shanghai (72-hour transit without a visa) and Japan (Kansai region). I am not really concerned about MERS itself, but how other governments respond to travelers coming from Korea. My biggest fear is landing in China and then it turns out there was a carrier sitting near us, which then places us in quarantine and invalidates the whole reason for taking these side trips. What was your experience upon returning? And should I be concerned about this?"
"I can only say what I saw on TV news on Saturday, in Chinese airport workers were washing and spraying a Korean airliner, completely inside and outside too. Not sure why they need to spray and wash the outside of the entire airplane. There is only one case of MERS in China, a Korean businessman. Their approach is very different than Koreans who don't think it is a big deal."
"I arrive in Shanghai from Seoul last weekend and was expecting a strict process for passengers from Korea. But aside from the normal sensor, there was nothing else."
"19 death, 154 confirmed cases, 5586 in quarantine, 100,000 tourists canceled. According to CNN."
"I was in Seoul and fell very sick and had to go to the emergency during my stay there. According to my doctor, I had acute bronchitis. The air pollution in Korea is very bad and my advice is to wear a mask while in Korea."
"Hi all, I will be going to s.korea next week and i am getting really worried cause everyone asking me not to risk it. I am actually flying from sydney( international student here), transit through HK and then to Incheon. I'm worried about the procedure at the both airport when i come back from the trip which is on July. Is there anyone here that had just recently coming back from S.korea through HK TO Sydney? Anything unusual at the airport or maybe stricter observation ?Thankss guys! Appreciate it!"
"I can't speak for Hong Kong (we are going to HK for three nights after Seoul!) but for Australia, we have no travel warnings issued for South Korea and I can't see there being any problems coming back in.Remind your family that while SARS killed 744 people worldwide, every year up to 500,000 people die of influenza, including 3500 in Australia, yet we don't generally spend time worrying about that. It helps to put it in a bit of perspective. While one could be extremely unfortunate, really the chance of getting MERS is virtually zero. All cases so far are connected to the hospitals, it is not in the general public."
i will be arriving on the 26th and i am very excited as well as worried because of MERS. i hope everything will be alright then. it'll be my first time and i am really looking forward to this trip since we booked and planned this trip as early as February.
"South Korean government is offering free ""MERS insurance"" to tourists. All medical and travel expenses will be covered should one be unfortunate enough to contract MERS in South Korea.koreatimesus.com/s-korea-to-offer-free-mers-…"
I really wish I had seen TravAus's post before I cancelled my trip to SK.
Same here :( few of my friends had cancelled their flights and now i might have to tavel alone if i still go with the plan.
thanks for the great info TravAusi'm leaving on the 12th july and continue to monitor this outbreak.i hope by then its cleared up!

Just like what mom always said.. just wash your hands and stop touching your face! So far they ruled MERS not to be airborne so I wouldn't freak out about breathing it. It appears to be contact. Proper and frequent hand hygiene is the way to go! Hand sanitizer is also a good temporary substitute. (this goes for diseases other than MERS).I'm not too concerned about the whole MERS situation... it just means less lines and less crowds when I go in a month.Edited: 5 years ago 
"As of June 16, 2015 The WHO wrote:WHO adviceBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because, like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing, should be adhered to.WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice."
Below is a link to an official Korean Gov't press release re: MERS Precautions & Insurance:english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/FU/FU_EN_15.jsp…
I just called the number for insurance. Its effective from 22/6. Travel + medical expenses capped at $3k and death at $100k. Which is not much considering the consequences.... That said the space will be freed up due to fewer Chinese travellers... A bit like the Game Theory.. Shall I go/not
"Same here @Travis T, though I am thinking of moving my July 23-26 travel dates to a later date. So far, more than a month to go before my scheduled travel. Many things will still happen in between. I'll just keep on monitoring the situation until second week of July. Praying that the situation improves as days went on."
"Well.... just as I suspected... patient #137 a non-salaried hospital employee rode the subway for nearly a WEEK! (and went to the mall and a hair salon) while exhibiting symptoms... now he is sick and quarantined and the South Korean Gov't is reviewing cameras in the subway stations he utilized to try to warn people who may have been exposed. What?! Ummmm... sh*t.... that's not really going to work. :/Oh, and now the gov't has released the fact that some patients are in their 30's and 40's (some immune compromised, some not). : ( This is really bad news.

"We just returned from 1 week visit to Seoul, In mho MERS is receiving more propaganda than it deserves there we been ever where in Seoul we didn't feel restricted or limited in movement some people wear masks we didn't do that but you can opt for using a mask if you really worried . We also didn't feel that we are putting ourselves at risk at any time"
"SEOUL — South Korea's health ministry reported on Thursday three more deaths in the country's Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak, bringing the total number of fatalities to 23. The ministry also confirmed three new cases, taking the total to 165 in the outbreak that is the largest outside Saudi Arabia. Thousands of Koreans have been put under quarantine, including those inside two hospitals that are under a two-week lockdown — meaning no one can enter or leave. In addition to the two hospitals under lockdown, another has been completely shut and the prestigious Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, where the most infections have occurred, has stopped taking new patients. Related: CDC Reminds U.S. Doctors to Watch Out for MERS About 6,500 people are in quarantine, some in hospitals but most at home, including an entire village of 105 people."
"I can't believe macbcmini hasn't been flagged yet. This is not Manila forum for sure. I couldn't say anything, this one guy kept on flagging me like crazy. Comes to show you, Koreans respect others opinions."
"@MsPikachu I would like to know what's Manila's involvement in this topic, either? (I'm just asking, no offense intended).I've been closely monitoring news about the situation due to my upcoming July visit. Aside from news that is being copied and pasted by @macbcmini (although his intentions are unclear since he claimed from his previous posts that he doesn't know Korea and he's not even an avid follower of the news), reported deaths, existing and new cases are only concentrated in healthcare facilities where the virus was first detected and no clear indications that the virus has already spread in the community, according to WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/travelin…wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx…"

"macbcmini, thanks for keep posting the statistics and updated news. It is up to people to decide whether they should go or not based on their own judgment on facts and their circumstances. I am still planning going early August with 2 small kids with the hope that by the end of June the number of new cases will be down to zero AND by mid July there is an official statement from the government and or WHO / CDC saying it is over.For those who will be travelling in July, you will be very much appreciated if you will kindly post the update on this threads. Thanks and have a great weekend everyone."
"Hi all, just thought I would update on our 11 day trip to SK, we flew back from ICN to HKG today. There were random temperature checks made at random points in the airport before passport control and a leaflet given about MERS, other than that as normal. There was no delay, we were not put into different areas and I did not see anyone stopped. As mentioned previously by other travellers the tourist attractions we visited seemed to be quieter but Seoul and Busan streets crazy busy all of the time, people going about their daily lives. Thanks TravAus for your input what you say makes a lot of sense especially flu facts which puts things into perspective. All I can say intrepid travellers is that I hope you make the choice that is right for you and your circumstances whether you travel sooner or later."
I will be flying to Seoul from Japan July 31 and staying until Aug 2I will then be flying to Hong KongHopefully MERS will have been contained by then! I also hope I don't get quarantined in HKAre people wearing masks and hand sanitizing in Seoul?
"I just came back from Seoul and it is business as usual there. Only people wearing masks are the tourists. I didn't even have trouble when I flew to Taiwan afterwards. They just body scanned me for temperature and that was it. It's very normal at Seoul, I think it's just international media making it a big deal."
"I was in Seoul from June 12-16. I even attended Ultra Korea Music Festival, which is a basically a rave where huge crowds of people were dancing skin to skin. When I was in Seoul, only a few people were we wearing masks and most of these were tourists. It was business as usual.As a safety precaution, I wore N95 masks on subways and buses, though I didn't wear one during the festival (ha!). I brought a small bottle of alcohol in my bag. I washed my hands before and after eating, and before and after using the toilet. I also avoided touching my face, especially my eyes and mouth. Just standard hygiene, really.Of course, that was last week. After I flew home, I stopped monitoring the MERS news in South Korea. But prior to my trip, I kept myself updated to make sure that the latest cases were still hospital transmissions, and not community transmissions.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Thanks for the updates everyone :)I'll be sure to update also, we arrive July 1."
"Hi TravAus,I have flights to Seoul on 29th June and am hoping you can give me a ""on the ground tourist perspective"" from your recent trip to South Korea. Did you infact go?"
Apologies. Just realised you land July 1st.
"I came here yesterday, the government is taking it very seriously. Health questionnaires, spray/disenfectant in many places. There is signage regarding MERS everywhere. I would say life is fairly normal as I have seeing the different parts of Seoul. The media seems to really hyped it in the U.S."
"Just finishing a 7 day stay at the JW Marriott in Gangam and heading off to Hong Kong tomorrow.Totally business as usual tone. Yes, lots of hand sanitizers all over the place and signs about MERS and reducing potential transmission. No more masks than I notice in other large Asian cities.Great trip for us and the hype on this issue was / is well overblown in my opinion."
"I watch CBS Evening National news nightly for decades and I read daily newspaper, old fashion guy, I have never seen any TV news about Korean MERS in the U.S. Or in Europe, as I was in Europe for 3 weeks in May. Newspaper news is tiny, buried in the back page in int'l section, page No.20-30. No media hype in U.S. and Europe, mass majority of people can't even find Korea on the map. Google is the easy way to find news.Edited: 5 years ago "
"As the MERS news worsened, we thought of cancelling our trip to Seoul, and, at the very least, avoiding the Metro. So glad we did neither! We've been here for a few days and it really seems like business as usual.I just posted a review of the Metro including pictures, so as soon as it's moderated, go have a look. As I said in my review, the Metro in Seoul is smooth, efficient and cheap. As would be expected, around rush-hour, the cars are standing room only.Maybe 1% of people are wearing masks. Literally 1 out of every 100. That seems pretty typical for large Asian cities. As I said, I am sooooo glad we didn't cancel our trip. It's hot and humid, but it's Seoul in June.Hope this helps allay some of your fears! Safe travels everyone! =)Edited: 5 years ago "

"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's health ministry, which reported four new cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) on Wednesday, said the outbreak was at a crossroads, backing off from its earlier view that the spread of the often-deadly virus had leveled off.The more guarded assessment came as the government extended the partial shutdown of Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, which had been due to end on Wednesday. About half the 179 infections in the country have been traced to the prestigious hospital, including some of this week's new cases.""We are at a crossroads, whether this is going to spread further or not,"" Kwon Deok-cheol, the health ministry's chief policy official, told a news briefing.""As of now we can't answer that part because additional cases have occurred, although we thought until last weekend it had leveled off,"" he said when asked if there was any change in its earlier view that the outbreak had settled.The country reported no new MERS case on June 20 but since then 13 fresh cases have been confirmed. During the peak of the outbreak early this month, new infections exceeded 20 on some days."
"Hi there, so the situation is getting worst?"
"I also have friends with recent visit to Korea, also some expats. According to them, everything is business as usual except that some tourist spots have fewer people compared to the normal busy day. This is maybe due to the hype created by media. It's like here in the Philippines where the news made terrorism a very sensational issue well in fact, these attacks only happened in select areas.If you're following daily news in the internet for updates regarding new cases, you will notice that contractions only occur within the confines of the medical facilities where known MERS cases are reported.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Lost of almost 1 million visitors in July and August. Korean Air Lines Co. and Asiana Airlines Inc. will cancel 230 flights to and from Japan due to the ongoing spread of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus through South Korea.Korean Air will suspend a total of 122 flights connecting Japanese airports of Okayama, Akita, Komatsu, Aomori, and Kagoshima with Incheon Airport in Seoul from June 24.The length of the suspensions will vary depending on the route. The Okayama-Incheon route will remain closed until Aug. 10, making it the longest suspension.Asiana Airlines is canceling 108 flights to Narita, Haneda, Chubu, Hiroshima, Toyama, and Matsuyama airports between June 30 and July 30. Excluding With Narita, Haneda and Chubu, none of the remaining eight Japanese airports have flights operated by other airlines that fly to South Korea.The MERS outbreak is also starting to take a significant toll on South Korea's tourism industry.According to the Korea Association of Travel Agents, the number of foreign travelers who signed up to visit South Korea in July and August was 203,000, an 82 percent drop from the 1.13 million recorded during the same period last year. The number of tourists from Japan and China during that time frame has fallen 84 percent to 28,000 and 132,000, respectively. Economic losses attributed to the MERS outbreak have totaled 12 billion yen ($97 million) so far, the association said.JTB Corp., a major Japanese travel agency, said it is having difficulty getting as many travelers as last year to book tours to South Korea for the upcoming summer break season.""There must be a lot of people keeping an eye out to see if the outbreak will die down,"" said a company official.A travel agency in Akita Prefecture said its business is being affected by the epidemic as well.""People are beginning to call off their company trips and tours in August and onward,"" said a company official.One travel agency said it is considering changing the layover stop of a Southeast Asia golf package tour from Incheon to Haneda Airport.A 62-year-old homemaker from Kanagawa Prefecture who was shopping in Tokyo's Shin-Okubo district, known as ""Korean town,"" said she has also decided to cancel her trip to South Korea this year.""For sure I want to know when the situation is going to be considered to be safe,"" she said."
"Posting inflammatory news articles ""ongoing spread of MERS"" does not help... I live here and there is no panic, no threat... Just normal paranoia brought on by media and ignorance... Please stop.You have a better chance of being killed by a North Korean invasion than even CATCHING MERS (which by the way, has a less than 12% mortality rate in Korea).Just like Koreans were after the Japanese tsunami and the Fukushima disaster. Please stop spreading fear and paranoia and provide relevant information pertaining to the issue.Edited: 5 years ago "

"Hi, I'm Vietnamese and will arrive Seoul on 1st July. My brother in-law, a doctor, has been trained about Mers. He told me that Mers outbreak is not that fear. Fatality is high if get infected by camel, but lower for human-to-human, the more the virus transmits, the weaker it is. The fact that 26 countries around the world have Mers but only South Korea got mers outbreak besides Middles East indicates that mers is not easily tranfered from human to human. Middle East still has mers becasue it has camel. Mers in South Korea became outbreak just because the man who travelled back from Saudi Arabia didnt report that he came back from Middle East, he visited several big hospitals before he was diagnosed to get mers. And as you all know, hospital is good environment for mers."
"Hi, i will go to Seoul on July 11.. I'm travelling with my 1 yo baby and husband.. Is it dangerous to travel to Seoul with a baby because of MERS? Because baby cannot wears mask :(.. Fyi, i'm going to Jeju Island first then head to Seoul.. Is there any MERS cases on Jeju island as well? Thanks"

It's up to each individual whether they wish to travel or not. It's clear the situation has died down but I'm getting the feeling you want people to feel doom and gloom about the situation in South Korea, instead of a balanced and realistic view of the situation (best gained directly from WHO, CDC, etc).I'm not going to report your posts, reporting is for when something is offensive or against TOS, you are free to post whatever you want otherwise, I just don't get your point when you say things about seeing China cleaning a plane and how they're taking it seriously unlike Korea, yet if you google as much as you say you do, then you must have seen all the photos of Korean airports, movie theatres, trains and PC bangs being thoroughly disinfected also..."
"Anyone of you can always report to delete any news you don't want people to know, or prove ""news"" are fake, easy to do.

Anyone can make their own judgement, as millions of travelers did. Is lost of one million tourists no big deal? Is that worthy news? Did you know that? I did not know.Many governments censor news because they don't think people are smart enough to make their own judgement, but Korean government are much wiser than that. You can delete my posts too, you can do the North Korean way. I like to see deletion to happen just to prove a point. In fact, go ahead and delete the entire topic. My opinion? It will be over soon, tourists will be fine. Is it serious? Very. Huge financial loss. Not LOL to all governments, nearby countries, hospitals, shops, restaurants, hotels, airlines or families of ill and dead, effects tens of millions of people, in comparison, what else can be so damaging? MERS will soon be gone, tourists will be fine."
"We would like to move on from the ""LOL"" now, you had your say many pages ago, if you still have an issue with it could you take it to private message with that person. This thread is in a travel forum, the discussion therefore is based around travelers travelling to Korea, rather than the economic impact on South Korea. Of course that is serious, as is the illness and deaths of people. However, the purpose here is discussion about travel. This is tripadvisor.If you want to delete your own posts, I believe you can ask TA to do it. It's not like I go back and read all the posts over again, so it makes no difference to me. I find it a rather juvenile response though to someone disagreeing with you, but that's just me."
SIZZUE you are safe... There is NO CHANCE you will be exposed to MERS as those that are infected are sick in the hospital and those that were exposed are under government quarantine... So unless you plan to go to hospital and live with an infected person you have a better chance of dying in a car accident going to the airport than catching MERS.
"RE CANCELLED TOURS AND LOST TOURISMJust an FYI and TRUTH about WHY tour groups cancelled trips to Korea. It's not because people (tourists) were fearing... Lots of people came to Korea this past month only about 10% less than normal. Tour companies cancelled trips due to the rise in INSURANCE rates. So rather than pay the huge rate increase, which they can't pass on to the prepaid clients they cancelled the tour and blamed MERS refunding the money.

She unknowingly contracted MERS from that patient. She then went home. When she became symptomatic, she went to a different hospital, infecting at least one nurse there. On June 25th that 70 y/o woman died at the 2nd hospital. Where else did the 70 y/o woman go after being infected? Who knows. Did she infect anyone else? Also unknown. Does Seoul seem safe? Yes. Am I concerned? Absolutely. It'd be foolish not to take some precautions. Am I glad I am here? Yes."
DAGNYG can you please provide the SOURCE of your story since NO ONE is allowed to visit anyone infected with MERS. and I've lived in Seoul for 6 years... I read and speak Korean... I've heard the stories... Most of it 99% is rumor.
"Well, Canadian, I first heard about it from an American doctor and his wife at a Piano Bar in Seoul. But, since you are asking for sources, here are two: The Korea Herald and the Korea Times. Links and excerpts below. I guess they do have a list of some of the ~ many~ places she visited around Seoul while contagious:https:/…116_181619.html""The deceased woman was exposed to a MERS patient on June 5 when she visited the Kyung Hee University Hospital in eastern Seoul with a man under her care. She was only placed on a monitoring list on June 18, despite showing symptoms of the disease on June 10.She was then diagnosed with MERS on June 22, 12 days after her symptoms had started. As her condition had already become serious during that time, the woman died two days later. .... During the eight days between first showing symptoms and the start of her monitoring, the woman visited four hospitals, including Hallym University Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, one Oriental medicine clinic and four pharmacies in eastern Seoul.""www.koreaherald.com/view.php…""She started experiencing MERS symptoms on June 10, and visited a number of medical facilities in Gangdong district of Seoul, including am otolaryngology clinic, before she was hospitalized at the Hallym University Medical Center in Seoul on June 18. By that time, she had already developed pneumonia, a disease that can seriously deteriorate a MERS patient’s condition.""Edited: 5 years ago "
"Despite the sluggish start, the local authorities are managing the epidemic systematically with quarantine policies for those potentially exposed to the virus and isolation wards for confirmed cases. However there is still significant time delays between identifying potential carriers and imposing quarantines. A few irresponsible people are not adhering to quarantines. There are still transmission from patients to medical staff, even in isolation wards.Is there a risk for typical tourists? Extremely small - certainly smaller than traffic accidents. However I would not go as far to say that there is no chance of an infection. There is no need to panic and cancel trips but excessive optimism is equally undesirable. One should be aware of the situation and certain precautions such as washing hands regularly should be observed."

"Yes, I have to agree with Canadian and TravAus. It is understandable for some to get scared of contracting the virus but admit it, if you're closely monitoring the news online, almost all known patients were among those quarantined in medical facilities, mostly elderlies with weak immune system and suffering existing illnesses.As I have my upcoming Seoul tour late July, I keep on monitoring news on the net. I noticed that the issue is starting to die down as I no longer see latest updates. In the absence of travel restrictions, I'm positive that Seoul is still safe. Just practice proper personal hygiene and strengthen your immune system and you'll be fine. Also, hearing from friends and friends of friends with recent SoKor travel, also few acquaintances who are now expats in Seoul for years now, that situation there is normal and business as usual, there's no reason for me to cancel my trip."
"Argh....I can't keep quiet anymore. I personally never found any of mac's post to be wrong and while they do have a debbie downer tone I'm not sure why the backlash. All she/he is doing is posting news relating to MERS...the same news I scour everyday before I send my kids off to Korea this summer. She/he has never said Don't come...Postpone.....It's terrible....all she has done is post relevant Mers info. It's all factual (as much as you can trust the news). What I find more offensive is to say there is zero chance you'll catch MERS. That is not factual. It's there. The outbreak is not over and the potential is there for things to blow up or get serious if just a few people decide not to seek treatment. It's a tense situation and it's up to each of us to decide how comfortable we are with that. Our Korean friends are actually quite worried, wear masks, and I've had to reassure them about the odds. They thought we should postpone. Maybe to them we are crazy but money is tight and the kids tickets are not refundable, so it's not just the simple matter of cancelling. Either way, no one should make up their mind based solely on TripAdvisor posts. I read all the posts. Read all the news. Did my math. (Odds right now...1 in 50000000. Add to that private home...plus my kids being young.....makes the odds better of recovery...what are we at? 1 in a gabillion) Bought extra insurance should the worse happen. So far I'm pretty confident with the odds, but I'm not blind either. There is a risk (like getting on a plane....leaving the house) and I'm taking responsibility for the fact that things could potentially take a turn for the worse and that could happen real quick. So can we be respectful of each others opinions (optimistic or pessimistic) without getting nasty, YELLING or taking on a bullying tone?Edited: 5 years ago "
"DAGNYG thank you for your clarification... It just proves my point when it comes to MISINFORMATION... your original post you state that she contacted the virus WHILE VISITING A RELATIVE INFECTED WITH MERS... My question was how could that be when NO ONE is allowed to visited those infected or quarantined... The article link you provided says she was EXPOSED to a MERS patient when she took the man she was caring for to the hospital (ie in the waiting room). Since I live in Seoul, I'm seeing things first hand. I'm asking those that read and HEAR things from a friend of a friend to be responsible for what they post. Thank you."
NARRIH the death rate in Seoul is less than 12% and only 2 of those who died DID NOT have pre existing conditions... Again please have your facts straight.
NARRIH the death rate in Seoul is less than 12% and only 2 of those who died DID NOT have pre existing conditions.Also the man who flew to Jeju happened almost 3 weeks ago... The incubation period for MERS is 7-10 days... Those exposed are quarantined for 14 days so that story is NON NEWS where it concerns present day situation. Again please have your facts straight and post responsibly/timely. I live here in Korea and I'm seeing things first hand... The news is reporting sensational info to sell fear... Most are not but the few that are not informed or paranoid. Think DOOMSDAY PREPPERS.

"Hi All,Will be heading to Seoul in September, do you think Mers will be fully contained by then? What are the odds? Would appreciate all opinions and comments.By the way,i really like how Canadian is actively updating us and giving us real time information, but why do you seem so agitated? Smile."
"Hi everyone. Landed in South Korea today and took the subway to our hotel as well as walked around the local neighbourhood. Whilst there are a handful of people wearing masks, it is not the norm and everyone seems to be carrying on business as usual. Our hotel manager said that she believes it has been blown out of proportion and whilst serious, the Korean people aren't worried. I also saw quite a lot of western tourists and expats out and about, on the subway etc and nobody seems concerned. Gotta love how the media sensationalises. From 2 Australians"
"We made our decision to go ahead with our 8D7N to Seoul during this MERS period. No REGRET! And we just came back last week. Life goes one as usual and not everyone putting on mask. No big deal so did we! The sightseeing and popular places were not crowded. We had our best times at Everland which no long queues for rides. Shopped at ease at Myeongdong street; no shoulder to shoulder rubbing with people. Guessed it was the best time during that period for sightseeing, shopping and eating! Due to business dropped, the sales girls gave us more free gifts!!! But as a precaution, we stayed away nearby places when we see Hospital though."
"Canadian: I refuse to get into a pissing contest with you. I think it is clear who is spreading ""misinformation"" on this topic.A 70 y/o woman ""accompanied"" or ""visited"" with an infected MERS patient in a hospital. She then left the hospital and traveled around Seoul for many days while she was infected with MERS and contagious. She infected at least one nurse at a second hospital (not the one she was at ""visiting"" ""waiting with"" ""accompanying"" the initial MERS patient).You are the one laughing and dismissing an epidemic so serious the South Korean Government issued Travel Insurance to foreign visitors and held all day cabinet/committee meetings to discuss.I'll let the record of our posts speak for themselves. I will no longer reply to you directly, but I will have a drink in your honor this evening with my friends and colleagues to toast everyone's health and happiness. Cheers! ;-)Edited: 5 years ago "
"For what its worth, I based my decision to keep my South Korean travel plans based on advice, data and recommendations provided by WHO and Smart Traveller - the Australian Governments Travel Advisory. I felt it would be negligent of me to base my decision on anything else.Am going to leave this forum now as I no longer feel it is serving its intended purpose, however feel free to inbox me if you feel I can add any value. As stated, I am simply a traveller in Seoul at the moment that can give you my on the ground perspective but for facts re travel health and safety I would recommend the sources above.Happy travels,Lauren W"
"I like this thread. As usual people are seeing things from two different angles, and then entrenching themselves.MERS is serious; it's not a common cold. People die from it. Mostly people already sick, but not only them.Should you stop planning to go to Korea because of MERS? Yes. if it worries you. No if you are able to look at the marginal extra risk dispassionately.Would I take my 2yr old grandson? No. Would I go myself (again!): Yes.As for what SK government is doing about health insurance, this is nothing to do with the risk and everything to do with spin."
"The insurance is about getting panicked tourists to come back, tourists who panicked due to dramatic headlines, leaving a huge economic impact on SK.I've maintained my ""alert but not alarmed"" status, but am also moving on from this particular thread, the word bully should not be diluted to mere disagreements, genuine bullying is a serious issue, and that's not what happened here. This is an Internet forum sadly following a predictable pattern.Thanks to all those who gave updates!"

"thanks CanadianinSeoul ..keep posting the real situation there. At least we can make our informed decision. I will travel on Sept, and so far I am quite confident that I am still going.Keep postingThanksJen"
"Second week in Korea now and the only thing we noticed so far is that most people wahes their hands and some cameras at train and busstations. We been to Gwangju, Busan, Pohang, Ulsan and most places in the south. Tomorrow we are heading to Seoul for the last week before leaving for home. The least i worrie about is Mers, I´m more worried for kids safty in traffic then this Mers Circus that media caused. Im travveling with my wife and our 3 boys, aged 8, 9 and 12. + points is less tourist and easy access to things you wanna do.Its not like entering ""The walking dead"" when going to Korea :)"
"Hi. Just got back from our 10-day trip in South Korea. We went to Seoul and Busan. Personally, it felt quite normal back there, Just on a number of locations though, you'll see some posters on safety measures regarding MERS. We did bring our hand sanitizers and washed our hands as often as possible. We even brought face masks but never really got to use them, since, we noticed that very few people (including Koreans) wear masks even in the metro subways.Overall, we enjoyed our trip. It seemed not that crowded when we visited the famous palaces in Seoul. The most crowded place that we went to was in Taejongdae in Busan, but that was on a sunday (weekend)."
"Hello,We will be having a lay over of 9 hrs in Incheon airport on 18-Jul (2 adults, 1 year old baby), what are your thoughts? Shall we consider getting another flight that layover is not in Korea?Thanks!"
"SWEETTRAVELLER ... No need to change as you will NEVER be exposed to the virus... First of all you are in the transit area and ALL people entering that area are screened. Second there are NO PEOPLE infected running around the streets of Seoul... The ""outbreak"" is basically over and has ALWAYS been contained inside of hospitals. So unless you plan on going to a hospital during your layover you will be safe... Please refer trip the WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION website for reliable information. PS I just returned from a 3 day trip to Tokyo and had no extra cautions or concerns."
"If it makes you more comfortable to change, do change. No point in worrying! But it is an unnecessary precaution."
Thanks for your reply CandianInSeoul I have seen in WHO that it is in level 1. Just a worry that we are bringing our 1 year old daughter.
"ALWJ, September is still a long way to go especially in situations like these. I believe things could either get only much better or much worse by then (no in-betweens), so at least you can make a clear decision when the time comes.For now, keep yourself informed of what's happening in Seoul and the rest of South Korea in relation to MERS. Yes, there are a lot of sensationalized clickbait headlines, but once you read the content, you're likely to get relevant information.Edited: 5 years ago "
My husband and I have a 23 hour transit in Incheon in August. We intend to go to Seoul for a few hours. Of course there is some concern but we are not changing our travel plans. I went to Tokyo in the height of the Swine Flu outbreak and did worry about it. We will try to wear masks and since we will not be there for that long.Live the life you love- love the life you live!
It is 5 July now and so far there is no update... Is it getting worst or getting better? Anybody kind enough to give us insight? ThanksJen

"seems that the situation is already under control, been monitoring the news online and I no longer see any recent updates.@Narrih - thank you for sending the link! This helps a lot :)Edited: 5 years ago "
"Currently at Incheon Airport...and everything seems normal. Few people are wearing masks. Mostly, airport staffs. However, I still brought an N-95 mask with me :)Just remember to update your flu vaccine + observe basic hygiene and always bring a hand sanitizer/ alcohol with you (washing of hands etc)Edited: 5 years ago "
Thanks tor the update! Hope you had a fantastic time in South Korea :)
"Hi Jen,Been in Seoul for the last 10 days out and about sightseeing and catching the subway everywhere. There are very little people wearing masks. Hand sanitiser is at all stations and everything is being kept exceptionally clean. There is no need to be concerned. I was originally too however as soon as we arrived and spent one day out sightseeing my concerns completely left."
Thank you so much Lauren and all contributors. Your reports are really helpful ..Safe trip everyone.Jen
I'll be landing in Seoul on Monday 13th July! I will give an update when I do! Thanks to everyone who have contribute to this forum. It's made my decision a lot easier to continue my travel to Sth Korea...
"Just finished travelling S.Korea for the past 2 weeks (Geoje, Busan, and Seoul) and everthing were perfectly normal and safe. I rode Subway and buses from one place to another, yes you could still noticed one or 2 ppl wearing mask but that's all to it. More tourist could be seen now and it is the perfect time to do shopping as there are lots of discounts here and there. My only suggestion is to keep yourself clean whenever you used the public transport or toilets, and you will be fine! :)Enjoy ur trip to everyone who's going by this month!"
"Hi Mudburger,I look forwards to your update. I want to buy my ticket today but still hesitant because of latest death about 2 days ago bringing death toll to 36. Please let me know what do you see around Seoul and public transportation (if you use them).Thanks!"
"Hi guys! Liked I promised. I arrived today in Seoul and everything looks to be normal. As everyone said there are only a couple of peeps wearing mask. There are tourist around but Not at staggering numbers.. I also saw a bunch of high school kids competing in a tennis comp. looked like they are representing their countries. As public transport goes, caught the express from airport into the centre, no problems, the normal rail ways are clean and to me looks like life is normal here. There are signs just to practice hygiene as you would anyway. I'm glad I didn't can my ticket because this city is pretty amazing. Hit me up if your in Seoul, maybe we can go have a drink or a bite! Happy travels to everyone coming here.Edited: 5 years ago "
@Mudburger Thanks for the update! I'll be there next week! :)
"Thank you Mudburger for your update,have been monitoring it for some time now...arrive Sunday :) :)"
"Just another update guys, been here for 3 days now i'm starting to see a lot more tourist around again. The hot spots are quite busy now. Weather has been great, if you like hot weather. Went to the tourist destinations and it was awesome because I could actually take photos without having anyone in the frame. All and all, if your planning on coming, please do! Its a pretty cool city!"
"Thank you so much Mudburger! Awesome. I feel confident now with my Sept trip.I just worried about booking my flight to Jeju now, seems much much harder than I thought !cheersJen"
"Hey JenIm sure you can take an express bus, I took one to Daejeon and it took around 2 hrs. Might be a bit longer for Jeju. You must spend a night in Daejeon if u get the chance. I stayed on the outskirts and it was pretty cool! Was there for 3 days!!!"
bus to Busan...sorry!

"Hi Mudburger,Thanks for the update! I bought my ticket about a week ago and glad to hear your update plus the news said MERS crisis is now over in South Korea. I wonder how if all the hotels in Seoul start cutting price as I'm still planning on hotel."
"If u need tips on where to stay, shot me an email via trip advisor! Glad I could help Hoa."
"Im here now in Seoul since night of July 22. Aside from a humid and rainy afternoon, everything seems normal already except that the two palaces I visited yesterday had few tourists. I only saw very few people wearing mask (I actually bought five but didnt use any of them anymore). The city is so beautiful, and Koreans are really warm and pleasant people :)"
"I would wait until it's over, we certainly wouldn't consider it until then."
"Hi, I have plan to travel to seoul in 20 August, for 5 days stay, is it safe or better choose other destination? thanks!"
It is safe ! I was there for 6 days and now I'm home and feeling fine. The crisis is over! The media had played it up too much.
Same here :) I was there for four days (just got home this morning) and everything seems normal already :)
"My family and I were in Seoul for 6 days from July 4-10. We were debating whether to cancel our trip or not. We were glad we didn't. Everything was normal. The palaces had fewer tourists but they started to show up. Most restaurants, hang out and shopping places were crowded. Hand sanitizers were everywhere. We really enjoy our trip."
"Update, Myeongdong right now. Re to Mers in Seoul and Jeju, until now I only saw 5 people wearing mask. Been in Korea since July 22 with my 2 small kids. Start from Incheon - took Arex to Gimpo - Jeju with Korean air - went to Seogwipo, Jungmun, Seongsan, Jeju city, back to Gimpo, wandering around Myeongdong - Insadong, City Hall - Deosokkgung- Geosokkgung- Lotte World Mall n Seokchon Lake, Hongik n EWHA univ, N Tower.I'm not really sure about the risk of Mers, but I feel safe n everything seems normal here. I've only saw 5 people out of couple thousands ppl wearing face mask. All tourist I've seen, white black yellow brown no one wear face mask let alone the N95.The only bad (or good?) is there are less tourist now, not too crowded in Myeongdong. (Although I felt a bit too empty in Seovwipo Jeju). Even the entrance fee for Deosokgung, Geosokkgung etc are free until July 31. We can easily take pictures in all those places.However I brought plenty N95 masker n hand sanitizer just for precaution although I havent worn any.Sorry for the grammar n typo. Hope this helps."
Thanks!
"The five of us (4 adults & 1 eleven months old baby) were in South Korea from July 16th-26th. Two nights in Sokcho, 8 nights in Seoul. Everything were normal there. Barely see anyone with mask. We brought masks but ended up didn't wearing it at all. Went to Deoksugung & Gyeongbokgung, not too crowded. Went to Myeongdong, place packed with people, so crowded. Rains a lot, makes it hard to go out side since we were traveling with an infant."
"It was hype to begin with, largely limited to one hospital, and the government just declared the 'epidemic' over. I was there from June 17-July 12 and the only reason I knew about MERS was because of the wall-to-wall news coverage on TV, the surgical masks and the signs. It's really all over now, so don't even think twice about going to Korea because of MERS."
Just got back from Seoul. I think it is safe to say there is no threat. At the airport and in Seoul itself people are going about their lives without masks. If there was anything to worry about I think it would be in the news everyday.Travel and experience Seoul now while you can!
