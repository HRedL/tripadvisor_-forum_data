That's encouraging news NC Thank you.
Yes I think it is too! Not only will this indicate who has already been infected (helps with the statistics) but how long immunity lasts and who is immune so travel will be easier.
Looking forward to reading the data eventually that says how long the immunity lasts - and if once a safe vaccine is available - could those people with serological detected antibodies and who are *willing* be used to test the vaccine against any new strain?
"NC - be very careful what you wish for with respect to government overreach and privacy. I would never ever want anything remotely like a health passport for a host of reasons, wtih the main being it would encourage infection, fake passports and tests. Do not encourage governments to collect information or control movements. I have stayed out of all these very political discussions over the virus but this is one too far."
kawarthalakes -do you remember (or are you too young) ? when we all had to have a Polio vaccination (or at lease I did living in Quebec at that time) and everyone had to have smallpox vaccination - and I had to have one prior to traveling (can;t remember whether it was returning to Canada or going to Europe)
"Yup it probably was 30 yrs ago Crisky - but it happened and we accepted it - we didn't have a tantrum about being told that was a requirement - as that was a requirement - it was what it was ..... same with kids attending school - they had the certificate - can;t remember where I required the Polio one -but where ever it was ? but had that one too....BTW sorry for typo in a previous post - wrote l wrote lease in stead of leastEdited: 11:55 am, May 13, 2020 "
"I remember as well ASO and Chrisky. I also have two school friends who didn't get the polio vaccine (not sure why) and are still dealing with the disabilities. I think Barbados requires proof of yellow fever vacination if you are coming from an infected area. Even to take our dogs to the US, Canadians must be able to show proof of vaccinations. That is their right and it is our right to refuse and not cross over."
"People who have recovered from Covid-19 will be tested to determine if they have immunity to this virus. That is good news.I'm not trying to damper anyone's happiness, but I could have sworn that these tests DO NOT prove that you have immunity - just test to see you have antibodies for the COVID-19. Does this mean possible immunity? Maybe, but it definitely shouldn't be taken as the Gospel for it. Having immunity and having antibodies are two different things. The tests that are out there right now as I've read in the news and scientific articles are just testing for antibodies..."
Cat if you have antibodies to a pathogen how do you not have immunity at that time?
New Hampshire to the north of me where I work has free tests for anti bodies. My state has them at $119. I might do it just to see. If it was free for me I would be there now. Doesnt guarantee a thing. I believe I read the accuracy at around 94%.
"Yes, thank you for including that link Canby.Here is also another source to a scientific/medical article by doctors. It's long, but thoroughhttps:/…2766097These are the main points from the medical article:""Serological assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are rapidly becoming available and will be critical to estimate the prevalence of infections, including those that are asymptomatic. However, it is presently premature to use such assays to determine whether individuals are immune to reinfection.""""In summary, existing limited data on antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses, as well as one small animal model study, suggest that recovery from COVID-19 might confer immunity against reinfection, at least temporarily. However, the immune response to COVID-19 is not yet fully understood and definitive data on postinfection immunity are lacking. Amidst the uncertainty of this public health crisis, thoughtful and rigorous science will be essential to inform public health policy, planning, and practice""I'm in NYC, so with my field - I can actually get an antibody test for free. With my job and commuting on the subways, I'm sure I have antibodies to the COVID-19 . I know that doesn't make me immune necessarily though. I would also like to add there are different antibody tests out there. Some are where your blood is sent to a lab and others are a rapid test where they prick your finger. I'm reading that the rapid test may not be as accurate as the lab/blood test."
"https://ca.news.yahoo.com/wuhan-test-residen…As new clusters emerge, WHO warns virus may be here to stay"
ASO ...and others ...yes I too remember having a vaccination card in the UK ... not sure however if it was required for all countries or just to certain destinationsStage 1 ...a reliable AND accurate test and can it cope with slight mutationsStage 2 ...depending on the level of antibodies .... what immunity does it give you Stage 3 ... how long does immunity last ...some COV type viruses give more immunity than others opinion seems to be that Covid 19 might be anything from 1 > 3 years I think we are a way off a Covid 19 PassportSome experts are saying that if antibodies are present - vaccines may not work !!!Usually you make more antibodies the sicker you are but then some people ( around 10%) just do not make antibodies !!!I think we are a way off a Covid 19 'Passport' but the matter is developing so quickly
So quickly .... this will be in Thursday's edition of the Daily Telegraph PHE has approved the Roche antibody test which is supposed to be 100 % accurate and has been tested at Porton DownFull details herehttps:/…and here https:/…Good news that for the first time the UK could be 'ahead of the game'
"I am assuming Public Health England and Roche have plenty of medical experts to offer opinionsThe trouble is ... knowing in general which 'medical expert' is correct or is offering the best opinionIn the UK we have SAGE ...which gives advice to the politicians from 100s of experts. Plenty of comment and discussion as to which part of the advice is correct or the best. Even the Chief Scientific Officer has admitted under questioning that there has been vigorous debate and some disagreement within SAGENow we even have an alternative SAGE group of 'experts' who disagree with the way the 'official' SAGE operate and in particular the secrecy behind their deliberations .... leaving us in doubt as to just how much the politicians are following the ""expert medical advice ""Some decisions ...such as sending Covid infected patients back to care homes from hospitals ...are clearly political and not medical. This may have lessened the pressure on the NHS but caused an even bigger problem in care homes"
there is supposed to be a #21 post fromTA-Martha (according to my laptop)..can;t find it?
"ASO yes there was a #21 that didn't post, not sure why. They seemed to have trouble getting this thread back in the forum after determining there was no reason for it to be closed and deleted. I don't know if they are having problems with their system or not."

On antibody tests ....Prof Johnathan Van-Tam ( UK Deputy Chief Medical Officer) has warned than it will take some time for the antibody test to be of significant value. Yesterday he said ....First of all you have to wait 2-3 weeks after infection for the first test - so that the antibodies have fully developed. A good number of people are already available in this category !!!Then you have to continually retest - to assess the continuing level of the antibodies...and you also have to test to see if the person has been reinfected. Ironically this becomes more difficult as the level of the pandemic declinesHe said that testing would be require for up to a year before the length of immunity could be decidedOnly then could it be possible to issue a certificate for travel or going to workIMO ...he is one of the most qualified and most experienced of the 'experts' used by the UK Government for public presentations. He also speaks in a way that the public can understand.Again IMO ... he should have been the one fronting the UK daily press conferences rather than an assortment of politicians - some of whom quite frankly are out of their depthSee here for his biographyhttps:/…jonathan-van-tam

"I heard that a ""challenge study"" would speed up the vaccine development. They have thousands of volunteers in over a 100 countries. Even if we need repeat vaccinations like tetanus or flu I can live with that.Trump has also announced a plan yesterday to ramp up the military to distribute the vaccine when ready and to start making it even before it is approved. He also said it will be shared world wide."
Yes I remember with polio vaccination - there was an initial shot and then a booster later on.
https:/…Health Canada approves first clinical trial for possible coronavirus vaccine
Thanks for posting ASO.
Health Canada has authorized the first clinical trial for a potential COVID-19 vaccine at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia.
"""Study subjects who received Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine had positive early results, according to the biotech company, which partnered with the National Institutes of Health to develop the vaccine.If future studies go well, the company's vaccine could be available to the public as early as January, Dr. Tal Zaks, Moderna's chief medical officer, told CNN""""The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has cleared the company to begin Phase 2 trials, which typically involve several hundred of people, and Moderna plans to start large-scale clinical trials, known as Phase 3 trials, in July, which typically involve tens of thousands of people""https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/health/coronav…"
As long as someone creates a safe vaccine - globally available - it has to be good news - but how to hurry up the safety long term phase test (stage 3) - I don't know how this can be done - if something takes months to test... how does one do it faster? it isn;t a matter of testing more millions - it is a matter of time necessary to see how long it lasts for isn;t it?
"As the NIH spokesperson said ""this is a different time"". Given that covid is killing people daily, by the thousands in some countries, I think the usual procedures will be adjusted."
"Let's just hope Trump will sell it to us. He is supposed to have the armed forces ramped up to start delivering etc a vaccine when ready, and some companies are already producing vaccines in case they prove suitable so they have a head start at supplying."
"Maybe that won't be a problem NC? - I have seen various pics on TV of demonstrators etc/ anti-vaxxers etc.- who have been protesting with banners that read ""Give me Liberty or give me Death"" - so maybe they may not want to take the vaccine and the company will be happy to sell it to Canadians.?...just sayin'..."
Works for us!!!

"I follow TripAdvisor pretty regularly and use it as a source of information for our travels, and certainly know that no place or excursion receives 100% positive reviews, so they must all be taken as a whole, and the few negatives tossed aside. I suppose the same logic could be taken with the various TripAdvisor forums.That said... As a citizen of the United States of America, I appear to be in the minority of posters on this Barbados Forum, as most seem to be from Canada and the U.K. No problems, we travel to Canada (back when travel was permitted) and on our travels have met many wonderful people from both and elsewhere in the world as well. Having been to Barbados just once now, we were able to experience why many on here like it so much. Regrettably, a return visit for this week was cancelled, rather, postponed til next June. I keep following to see when it may be possible to book another trip, maybe in January. This, in particular, is why I've been following this ""Another step closer..."" Topic. However, the continuous barrage of derogatory and negative comments towards my President are becoming increasingly difficult for me to withstand. I don't make similar disrespectful public comments about anyone else's leaders and never did regarding my past President. I/we love to travel and really don't want to read this political negativity when I peruse this site. Maybe if everyone who does this could just stop and think how they'd feel if someone wrote something similar about their leader, they would think differently. Likely, if it continues, then it's a good bye from me. Rant over, stay safe.Edited: 9:48 am, May 20, 2020 "
"Sorry - I was just baffled that having having the most C19 cases could be a good thing ?- - maybe it is? - apologize if it is disrespectful to your President - on the other side of the border - we are doing everything we possibly can to ""flatten the curve"" - reduce cases down - to wear masks to protect others, to take all possible precautions and to stay home as much as possible in the hope for a workable vaccine so we don't run the risk of dying (especially me, as I am in the ""vulnerable"" age group) as I want to return to my winter home in safety.... - I think this pandemic has got on everyone's nerves to the extent that we are all getting cantankerous, irritable - touchy - and not our usual happy cheerful selves - sorry if my post was inappropriate but the comment did seem weird to me....."
The US is clearly lacking in leadership during this crisis and that will impact Caribbean tourism.
"@Dan M , i despise our president but i love our country. i agree with your sentiments. This happens a lot on this forum. Too much politics and other topics totally off subject.

So i still tune in for my daily dose of TA"
Thanks for posting Chrisky .... I would love to think that there would be a safe vaccine soon - (I dread the idea of spending a Can. winter here for the first time in 32 yrs!)
"Yes Chrisky this thread has drifted and since I started the thread, I would like it to get back to the subject... another step closer to returning to Barbados."
"In terms of getting back to ...""a step closer to returning to Barbados"" ....or in some cases your own country I believe that the leaders of all countries can have a significant effect on that goal Having abandoned quarantine ...who would have guessed that the UK would re-introduce it - just as some other countries are talking about a relaxation and 'air bridges' etc etcThis may become more significant as Governments start to set 'rules' on which country's residents they they will allow to enter. How 'safe' a country is will depend on a number of factors but some of them could be affected by the leaders decisionsI believe it therefore entirely appropriate to examine the pronouncements and actions of world leaders as it may affect our travel plans Trump is just one that stands out more than others and therefore gets more comments ....and Dan, I can assure you he is not the only leader who has been criticised on this and other forums. In the UK Boris has mostly done a disappearing act over the past few days and is coming in for ever increasing amounts of criticism on the way he has handled the UK's reaction .... including from members of his own party and the (secret) scientific advise that he is supposed to have followedInteresting to note that NZ ...one of the least affected countries in the world ..... has opened up domestic air travel ...but remains closed internationallyEdited: 5:24 am, May 21, 2020 "
"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52747112 NHS England official cautions against buying antibody testsHealth officials in England have already approved an antibody test. There is no date for when it will be rolled out, but Health Secretary Matt Hancock said earlier this week the government was in ""the closing stages of commercial negotiations"".On Wednesday, Superdrug became the latest business - and first high street retailer - to offer the antibody test. The kit costs £69 and buyers need to take a blood sample at home, which is sent off to a lab for testing."
UK Government today announced two key decisions that could affect travel from the UK10 million antibody tests from Abbott and Roche to be offered NHS and Care workers ...both giving close to 100% accuracy Certificates could be issuedPerhaps more importantly for the airlines and those wishing to travel is the announcement of a 6 week trial on a test for Covid 19 that will give an answer in 20 mins If it proves reliable this would be a real game changer for travel ... the test COULD become part of an extended check in procedure There is also mounting pressure to review the possible introduction of a 14 day quarantine for visitors ... many saying ...what is the point ???After a massive U turn by Boris on the despicable decision to continue to charge migrant NHS and Social Care workers a levy to use the services of the NHS it would not be a surprise if a U turn is not announced on quarantineThis is yet another example of Boris totally failing to grasp the detail of an issue and getting the numbers completely wrong
"Headline in today's Daily Telegraph ....""Police spot checks to enforce quarantine""So it does appear that the Government is planning to go ahead with a 14 day quarantine ...BUT there are a number of influencial 'Senior Tories' who are questioning the sense of such a move .... including some who are/ were strong supporters of Boris Government unclear if a vote in Parliament will take place ...which probably means they are unsure about a possible rebellionAlso some technical details to resolve ...including the power to lock up individuals who do not have the required information at point of entry. Additionally police may require new powers to require a named individual to come to the door!!!Checks are expected to be around 100 a day which seems very small ...with fine starting at £1000. Uncertainty about recovering the fines from departing overseas visitors There will also be loads of exemptions IMHO ....another confusing mess about to develop but more detailed plans later today"

"""""""Is Boris losing his grip or has he gone AWOL ??""""""Yes to both your questions ...not sure if he ever has had a true grip of the details ..but we must not digress !!!"
I’m not normally political but do think that if Mr T took a leaf out of Boris’s book and went AWOL for a while he wouldn’t be picked on by people so much. It would stop him putting his foot in his mouth for a while which would help. Much as we’d love to visit Barbados again in Oct/Nov we’d prefer to postpone it till 2021. I just hope the airline or the government say we can’t travel so we get our money back.

"MDP, so did our Prime Minister and the Premier of Ontario although neither had covid-19. Some medical leaders are suggesting actions like this are not helping and may be leading to quarantine fatigue and people ignoring the rules. Canada has had quarantine/self isolation rules since the end of March and is now just starting to open up. So yesterday in Canada's largest city we had thousands (by some reports) of mostly young people gathering in a city park and obviously not following the social distancing rule or the mask rule. The cops reported on tv that the situation was impossible to police. In 10 to 14 days we will see if this breach of the rules and common sense not to mention disregard for others sets us back... creating a step back before we can return to Barbados."
"Thanks for posting Canby - yes I have heard most of this being discussed on CBC Newsworld over the past week or so.... I'm really not expecting to have an opportunity to be able to get a vaccination myself until sometime next year, and that's being really Optimistic...."
Thanks Canby. There is lots to learn from this pandemic and I don't mean just about the disease itself.
NC .... much the same in the UK ...although on the whole those on the beaches and in the country parks are trying to maintain 2 metres ( UK suggested distance still) but it is generally agreed that more people are beginning to tire of the inconsistencies ... probably more Dominic Cummings type revelations to come - especially when the police APPEAR to have known about his actions and not issued a fineDoes not help that Boris remain AWOL - just sending out other ministers to say it was an 'emergency' and therefore OK. The are (were) rules for this situation which he did not follow As you report from Canada the police are saying it is getting more difficult to monitor and speak to those not social distancingDifferent populations ..... but how are the police monitoring/ taking action in Barbados ???
"Mdp The Police are still driving around all night and there seem to be Curfew breakers in Court several days a week Being fined or threatened with jail ( or both ) On the whole , I think most people are being respectful of the rules , but the most recent actual Covid spread , was caused by a Church Congregation , I think 28 in a Bridgetown Church . I believe 5 tested positive so far afterwards , but don’t quote me on that . Quite ironic when I heard the Orange thing saying all churches and mosques and synagogues should open for worship immediately !!  Is this man actually competing to have the most deaths on record ever ? Surely he can’t get back in in November now , can he ?"
"Remember Westie, no one thought he'd get in the first time but he did, not by popular vote but by the electoral system. The world was caught off guard! So get ready!"
So the start of 2021 could be when a vaccine is ready. I wonder if they are considering Moderna which is ahead of any other project. They are ready to start a condensed phase 2 and then start an accelerated phase 3. I read that they will be starting production before phase 3 is finished to get a jump start on supplying it. It will be interesting. The other factor is treatment. With almost 100 drugs ready for approval surely some of them will affect the covid outcomes much like they do for HIV-AIDS... no longer the killer it was.

There is a lot of research going on in many countries as to the precise meaning of antibodies in your systeminformation s supplied in an interview with virologist Dr Sarah Pitt ......It depends on the level you have ..we are not all the same - generally it is believed that the more seriously ill you are - the more antibodies you produceSome people (estimated at 10%) do not develop antibodies even though they have had the virus ...and if the virus mutates into a milder form - it may not produce antibodies at allMost of the research is looking at how long the immunity may last and of course that is something that will take time to establishImmunity does not last for ever and antibodies reduce quite fast - probably altogether within 2 - 3 years The Roche and Abbott test were shown to be almost 100% accurate in trial but some failures showing up in mass use A GP I know who tested positive but produced a negative Abbott test
back on topic ....Reports in the UK today that the Government is coming under increasing pressure to drop the universal 14 day quarantine ... both from the whole travel industry and from a cross party group of 45 MPsApparently there is now a majority in Government and the Cabinet who are against universal quarantine 'Air bridges' ( or travel corridors) are being pushed by senior ministers in the Dept of Transport and the Treasury and the principle has been endorsed by Public Heath EnglandDfT also working on a number of safe practices for airports - including contactless check in for all airlinesOf course this will not included countries that continue their own quarantine arrangements on arrival Following months of secrecy over the minutes of the SAGE committees - some of them are finally being published - following massive pressure from all quartersThey do highlight what many have suspected - not all UK Government decisions have been according to 'expert advice' ....what a surprise !!! Quarantine introduction was one of them - but the key recent decision to reopen schools and shops is against the advice of SAGE who believe it will push the R back above 1Interesting times ..Lets be careful out there
"Following on from #92 - reported today that 2 more important Government Departments have come out against the 14 day universal quarantine ..... Business Energy and Industrial Strategy along with Digital, Culture Media and Sport who ""hate it ""It is increasing likely that the quarantine may be abandoned / or severely modified on the first review if not beforeAirlines are scheduling a dramatic increase in flights for July ...despite many counties still not allowing visitors!!!Further revelations from the minutes of SAGE are most revealing ..... more decisions that were political rather than simply"" following the advice""Nothing at all wrong with this - however it would have have been so much better if the Government had been honest about their decisions rather than trying to hide behind the adviceThe infection rate in the whole of the UK could drastically affect our ability to travel. More failed targets set by Matt Hancock on May 15th ...to test all Care Home staff by the end of May. With one day to go only managed around about 10% Also the lack of regular test for all medical staff is a likely cause of new outbreaks - especially from those who are asymptomatic - presently estimated at 10 > 20 % At present very little hope of much travel to or from the UK !!!! Hope this change soon"
"UK Ministers have been sent a list of 45 countries to prioritise for quarantine-free ‘air bridges’. Airlines drew up the index last week at the request of the Government amid mounting fury over ‘unenforceable’ plans for a 14-day quarantine imposed on all arrivals. The list, agreed by airlines including British Airways, EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic, includes favourite holiday destinations in Europe, such as France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece, along with the US and much of the Caribbean, including Barbados."
According to press reports ...unfortunately Spain will not include the UK on its list of 'welcome' countries and France is advising a 14 day quarantine for UK visitors
If the UK is opening its border to the US which has 24 states with uncontrolled covid infection spread.... good luck! Nothing like putting the economy ahead of health and safety. Another factor to consider is the riots where it is obvious that social distancing was not practised. Expect a spike in a few days.In Canada we are hoping they keep the border closed until the States get a handle on the situation.
"NC,Do not blame you at all for wanting to keep your borders closed:https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-837…"
"#95 MDP where did you read that about France? I've only read it as being a VOLUNTARY scheme applicable to all countries not just UKEdited: 7:40 am, June 01, 2020 "
John F ... yes I appreciate that ... for advisory read voluntary !!!If they bring it in they have also issued a list of exemptions ..which include transit through FranceWas until today considering driving to the Mallorcan villa but with Spain not encouraging UK citizens and France still not open ... too risky as final payment wanted today !!!Agents have been very good ... transfered all the 2020 payments to our 2021 reservation
"Although this is not medical it may make a difference to Canadians wanting to return to Barbados. I have just noticed that Air Canada offers change and cancellation at no cost with their comfort class tickets. That is a big plus!I have also discussed in another thread, ID NOW, the new rapid PoC antigen test developed by Abbott Labs. At this point FDA has approved it for emergency use only in the States. It will be used in hospitals, clinics, doctors offices etc. It produces a positive test in 5 minutes and a negative test in 13 minutes with 98.6% accuracy and very easy operation. Perfect for screening at the airport before bording."
"Not such good news... ""The primary type of testing for the novel coronavirus around the world, including Canada, produces “false-negative” results at least 20 per cent of the time, researchers from Johns Hopkins University found.According to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in May, the false-negative rate of RT-PCR testing used to detect the novel coronavirus changes depending on where a person is in the timeline of the infection cycle.""...

Breaking news...Barbados is to open to commercial flights next month.https:/…A return to Barbados is getting closer.
"https:/…Caribbean governments should not be surprised if international airlines want to be paid to resume flights following the COVID-19 shutdowns, Hugh Riley, retired secretary-general of the Caribbean Tourism Organisation (CTO) has said.Riley said payment for airlift was a likely consequence given the heavy losses airlines have endured as a result of the global pandemic.Addressing a webinar hosted by the Sagicor Cave Hill School of Business on the economy, Riley told participants: “Airlines are talking about fee waivers and there is going to be a lot of demand for financial support for the aviation industry. Governments are starting to see that already.“There is going to be a shift in the balance between airline seating destinations to fly to and destinations paying airlines to come.“That is how the balance will be shifted. It is a tough pill to swallow but that is the reality.”The tourism consultant, principal with the PM Group, explained that airlines have also urged regional governments to harmonise their post-COVID-19 protocols to make flying to the region less cumbersome when the destinations reopen.He said: “The airlines have already said to the region that there must be harmonisation of protocols. Nobody is going to be trying to remember which island has which protocol. No one will be hopscotching through a whole maze of these protocols. If you can harmonise them, you stand a greater chance of success.”Offering some background to the importance of the tourism industry to the region, Riley said in 2019 a record 31.5 million visitors came to the Caribbean by air and about half of them came from the United States. More than two million jobs in the Caribbean are dependent on the travel and tourism industries.And in preparation for a resumption of tourism, Riley said consumer sentiment trends suggested that travellers are likely to stick close to home, travelling only if they can be persuaded they will feel comfortable about their health and safety.“There is no agreement yet on targeting for a vaccine, so testing and sanitation protocols and procedures and the health of travellers will clearly be focused on because no one will want to travel without those protocols and procedures in place,” he noted.According to the consultant, consumers who feel emotionally connected to a brand are likely to be among the first to return.“The familiars are likely to come back first. They are the ones who are familiar with the region. They have been here and it is not an unknown for them. Repeat visitors… and property owners who have a stake in the destination and those in the diaspora will also be returning.”Riley also told participants: “In the past, people in the accommodation sector believed [the diaspora traveller] is just going to come home and stay with their aunt. Many people in the diaspora don’t have a relative to come and stay with. They come and stay in hotels and other accommodation just like everybody else. And those who come and stay with their cousin or their aunt, they spend money, rent cars, go out to eat, they contribute and their money goes straight into the economy.“The romantic traveller will also likely return early, and special interest groups, but all depends on people’s financial security. About 40 million people in the United States are now out of work. And if you are concerned about your financial situation, you are not likely to choose a vacation away from home.”"
I have just read of an island government that is selling covid insurance to visitors who are not covered. Maybe Barbados will do this as well and hopefully keep the cost reasonable for those staying longer than 14 days.
Wouldn’t that be great?
"I didn't get all the details ( I will try later) but it covers you if you catch covid. You need to have insurance for other diseases/accidents though. I heard $15.00 US/day which everyone said is too high, especially for long stay. You are required to have proof of a neg covid test done before departing your country, you will be screened at arrival. If you have a temp you go into 14 day isolation and tested again. It is not perfect but a start. Hopefully Barbados will come up with something better."
