"Just curious,Wherever you live / maybe travelling from... How easy / hard is it to request a test and how long before the result...?"
"Which test are you talking about?Here in NJ it's still very hard to get a ""swab"" test -- the test to determine if you are currently infected -- unless you are symptomatic, or high-risk plus exposure to infected person, or are a healthcare provider.Antibody test is no problem. You can go to your doctor, pay for the test, and have the results in a couple of days."
It is very easy to obtain a covid test and an antibody test in New York State. I had the antibody test done and I had the results back in 2 days.
"Hi RJP-NJ,Actually that has changed it is now easy to get a COVID test in New Jersey even for asymptomatic individuals at many pharmacies including CVS, Rite Aid and Walmart. NJ.com (Star-Ledger site) posts a daily article with links to available testing locations, here is today's version:https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/06/where…"
"<< ""it is now easy to get a COVID test in New Jersey even for asymptomatic individuals at many pharmacies"" >>As the article you linked to mentions, for the pharmacy-administered tests such as at CVS... ""Tests will be available for individuals meeting CDC criteria and age guidelines."" Which are currently as follows:Hospitalized patients with symptomsHealthcare facility workers, workers in congregate living settings, and first responders with symptomsResidents in long-term care facilities or other congregate living settings, including prisons and shelters, with symptomsPersons with symptoms of potential COVID-19 infection, including: fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, vomiting or diarrhea, and/or sore throat.Persons without symptoms who are prioritized by health departments or clinicians, for any reason, including but not limited to: public health monitoring, sentinel surveillance, or screening of other asymptomatic individuals according to state and local plans.Which is pretty much what I pointed out in my post. As far as I can tell, including based on people I konow trying to get a test, it seem as if an otherwise healthy, asymptomatic person, who doesn't fall into one of the groups above will not be able to easily get a swab test at a CVS or other pharmacy in NJ."
"I can get the antibody test easily and quickly as described above at a pharmacy, and my NJ county will do the regular test even with no symptoms. Results in a couple of days. I am in South Jersey though, not the hot spot."
"Same here joebwan.I got the antibody test at Immediate Care in Brick (Ocean County), but they also offer the standard 'do I have COVID now?' test to anyone regardless of symptoms."
"UK is very easy, a test for COVID takes around 72 hours from rest to resultsThe antibody test is not widely available at the moment"
"The test to find out if you have Covid-19 is easy to get in MA. Drive-through at CVS is the most widely available site. The antibody test is available with a doctor's .authorization, but apparently the test was also available at the CVS site for $130."
Easy. Any doctor or drive thru.
"Sounds relatively easy, which is good.Keep that in mind..... :)"
In SE PA- 10 miles outside of Philly- very very easy.... multiple testing sites no doc order needed and no need to be symptomatic
"As I was trying to hint in my post earlier.....""Keep that in mind..... :) ""Hope that at least some folks can get the paperwork and come and see us! :)"
the problem isn't getting the test.... the problem is the test results being within 3 days is what makes it more difficult... if you are going to land on island on the 23rd the test date can't be any earlier than the 19th. doesn't give much leeway for delayed results...which is very common.

Definitely not wanting to cancel, but curious how to make this work."

"Makes a Sunday, Monday or Tuesday arrival almost impossible.Edited: 1:16 pm, June 26, 2020 "
"I think it makes it difficult for many Americans to even consider traveling to TCI or anywhere else for that matter. I live in a state (NJ) that claims anyone who wants a test can get a test, however have called 5 local testing centers and all have required that we be symptomatic, one required a Dr prescription, and 4 out of 5 seemed incredulous at the idea that we were planning to travel. We will research a bit longer and then likely cancel Sept trip that is scheduled."
"<< "" I live in a state (NJ) that claims anyone who wants a test can get a test,"" >>I also wonder how many people here on TA that say ""tests are easily available where I live"" have actually gotten one vs. simply reading somewhere that tests are supposedly easily available."
"My sister was able to get an appointment at Rite Aid for a drive up test. No symptoms, but she was going to care for their granddaughter in another state. Negative, thank goodness.My friend's daughter and her boyfriend were able to be tested at a walk in clinic on Wednesday. He was symptomatic, she was not. They got the results today - 2 days. He came back positive, she was negative. But now she is developing the same symptoms that her boyfriend had, so she will be retested tomorrow.All three tests were easily obtained in New Jersey."
"Thanks, I am sure that I could obtain the testing somewhere (have heard lots of anecdotal stories). As to having the results in hand within 72 hours, it is not something on which I would bet $10k."
"Yeah, I can get the test really easy. So far results in 5-7 days. Still trying..."
"A lot of people are commenting on the TCi Tourism FB page that they are cancelling their trips as they’ll be unable to get results within 72 hrs. Plus, many states/provinces don’t allow testing unless you have COVID symptoms, including the province I live in...not that I plan on going any time soon."
"Reminder, the test has to be a PCR test."
"It’s still 4 weeks away plenty of time to organise a test, I would not cancel just yet"
"Happyybubbles: Good catch!Edited: 1:14 pm, June 27, 2020 "
NY just waived any conditions for obtaining a Covid test and results can be obtained in hours.
#28 The only test the TCI Government is accepting is a PCR test the results of which are not available within hours. Are you sure this a PCR test you are talking about? Great news for NY metro area people if so.
We are in NC. Most places seem to want either exposure or symptoms to test. Most people I know have been getting test results in 5 days .
"Just got a call from my sister. My sister and brother-in-law were exposed to someone who had Covid and they had a hard time finding a place to get tested. Most places they called said they had to have symptoms, so in Michigan you can’t get a test if you want a test. My sister feels there is a shortage here."
We were told in NY that there are plenty of tests for everyone. They are encouraging everyone to get tested.
Well if you can get a test. It is at 3 to 7 days for results. So you don’t meet the 72 hour window.
"Why is everyone bantering.? Bored? No one is traveling anywhere in the distant future. It is what it is. Just keep reading all social media, etc. this forum is becoming boring.Everyone in all the world can figure out the Covid testing on their own."
Arriving late July. Just got insurance through Nomads. Very reasonable . Called the TCI tourism board actually gave them insurance info . They are very nice the woman who answered the phone said they are being flooded with calls about how impossible it is getting results and tested within 72 hrs. Sounds like it’s being addressed they want visitors and hopefully we will hear more soon on TCI assured website . There is a phone number to call if you have more questions. I called today and that’s the latest .

LoriB: Thank you. How much was the insurance per person and what was the entire coverage? Did it include airlift to Miami since TCI-Provo hospital cannot handle severe “anything” cases.
"It was $137 for two people for 10 nights. Super easy did an online quote booked and had the certificate immediately . It includes Medical and Evacuation insurance . It’s all laid out pretty simply on their website . That price was for the two of plus not pp.Edited: 8:03 pm, July 02, 2020 "
Wow. That is great. Dr. Jim quoted thousands of dollars.
"Dr. Jim quoted a price if NOT covered by insurance to have to be sent off island by Medivac.Lori...amazing pricing for proper insurance.Edited: 12:02 am, July 03, 2020 "
"From worldnomads.com website:""Due to the widespread media reports of Coronavirus (COVID-19), and the World Health Organization (WHO) announcement declaring COVID-19 a pandemic, COVID-19 is a foreseen or known event. If you are purchasing a new policy, certain coverages will not apply"".""This Policy covers losses resulting from unforeseeable and Emergency circumstances only"""
Please accept my apologies Dr. Jim. I meant to say the airlift portion which is $1000s.
"Numbers, usually medical travel includes the airlift. It doesn’t cost $1000s unless you don’t get the evacuation insurance which the insurance itself maybe adds $100 to total policy"
"#47: I am a very simple person. One week of medical insurance = cost.Airlift cost not included in medical insurance =cost. FYI, which I presume you know, there are airlift costs out of T&C for many medical issues. Their hospital does not have the facilities. Call them, they shall tell you,Nothing that ridiculous to figure out since people on this forum expound that they might know the answer. Not . Can you provide the math and potential vendor? Two people provided at least something.Edited: 4:47 pm, July 03, 2020 "
"Numbers, get evacuation insurance with it. Some plans include it in their medical travel insuranceYou need to call around and shop it for the price just like everyone else doesIt might add a couple $100s more to trip, really usually less than 10%So you’re welcome to call companies and give us the prices you found if you’d like It’s like all insurance shopping, shop around. Everyone has a different trip. The price is based on a particular tripFor example, a brand new Ferrari to insure costs a lot more than a used Honda, yet both share the roadDoes that help you understand?"
"To get back on subject...72 hr testing might be a slow “opening”?Edited: 12:01 am, July 04, 2020 "
"#44 They may have changed this since you posted. I just clicked on to their website https:/…travel-insurance""...Cancellations due to fear of travel are not covered under the plan. However, our plan does not exclude losses associated with pandemic or epidemic conditions; meaning that if you, your traveling companion or family member were to become sick (after you purchase the plan) as a result of the COVID-19 virus, you could still receive benefits for losses covered by the plan. .."""
"It seems they have two different opening statements depending on your residency. The staement you have quoted is for US residents and the one I posted is for Canadian residents, go figure!"
Indeed. When I tried to get a quote as a Canadian it went to a dead link. Seems to work OK if you put US as the starting country. Nationwide is the under writer for the US based policy. Maybe try TD insurance for Canadians?
"I was just doing a random search. I have had worldwide coverage for 10 years through IMG which is covering Covid. T least that is what their email said.!?Edited: 2:10 pm, July 04, 2020 "
"Since Canada has been mentioned, I’ll chime in. We have a government issued global travel advisory to avoid non essential travel. Because of it, I don’t know of any Canadian insurance company that will cover for Covid or for any travel related issues. Our government is being proactive and saying stay home right now.Edited: 12:00 am, July 05, 2020 "
Canada has extended closed borders until end July. Possibility will stay closed to the end of the year. TCI will likely only have US visitors. The US has a quarter of the world's Covid cases and increasing. It is essential that TCI maintains the test result for entry.
Post #56 but it is a shame that we all suffer because of the US numbers. We have a closed border to the US and Canada is doing very well..in Ontario dropping numbers everyday and currently many of the few cases we have are migrant workers who are not close to the large cities in Ontario.
"Again, does not matter for travel. Each and every country has new laws daily about the Covid virus. Can anyone on this forum control? No. Just continue to hunker down in your own country. Yes, frustrating but need to deal with until 2021. Maybe if you personally have a cure, let everyone know,Edited: 4:58 pm, July 05, 2020 "
Not so easy in SC - you have to have symptoms!
Not so easy in SC...you HAVE to have symptoms!
"Extremely hard to get testing in S.C. if you don’t have symptoms!! When you call Turks & Caicos to discuss this (as they require for entry) they are NO help & tell you off!! Asked why, if they are going to require the test, they don’t set up a rapid test site at landing airport there & turn people back who test positive. They said, then it would contaminate passengers on airplane ride back. I pointed out to them that airlines do not require covid test results before anyone flies - that’s how little risk they believe it is for someone who is asymptomatic with covid. Turks & Caicos is run by uber liberal government who is imposing these strict requirements which will hurt their tourism economy & in turn, hurt its own people. People who know they are sick will not go if they know they will be tested & have to leave if positive. As for asymptomatic carriers, that myth has been debunked by so many reputable studies!!"
Exactly!! Major problem!! And what good are the results 5 days out?? Someone could test negative 5 days out and then 3 days before leaving get covid. The whole thing is a sham!
Exact same situation in S.C.! It’s all ridiculous!!
"Exactly!! And if you call TCI to discuss this, they are NO help & tell you off! Makes me not even want to go there!"
"Sounds is the key word! It’s actually not that simple if true to do it. Scheduled to come with family next week, but everywhere we call says we have to have symptoms to get tested. Not so easy! And when you call TCI to discuss this, they are NO help & tell you off!!"
"Not so in SC! You HAVE to have symptoms or NO test! If you call TCI to discuss this, they are NO help & tell you off!!"
"OP and SCnative: Feel your pain. Maybe go into the Facebook page of the premiere, T&C. All entry requirements are spelled out. Good luck; usually not enough time for testing results to be produced and used for travel. In a pinch, stay in your area at a fine resort instead of airline travel. 2021 is another great year."
