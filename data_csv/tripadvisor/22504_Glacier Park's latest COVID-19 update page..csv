"This update from the Glacier Park Facebook page today:""This weekend’s visitation patterns indicate visitors are NOT adhering to CDC recommendations.With spring in the air, the Apgar and Lake McDonald areas are experiencing busy and crowded conditions. Snow-packed trails and roads are narrow, and many popular trails and attractions do not allow for adequate social distancing or limited group sizes. Full parking areas equate to high visitation, placing National Park Service employees at risk, including employees cleaning restrooms, emptying trash, answering visitor questions, and ensuring visitor safety and resource protection.While time spent in nature helps during this time, we urge visitors to explore less visited areas of the park, other public lands, open spaces in surrounding communities, or even backyards. If you encounter a crowded trailhead or attraction, please remain flexible and visit another location. During this period of uncertainty, we encourage visitors to enjoy Glacier online via webcams, audio tours, photo galleries, videos, and other digital content.""If the park continues to see too many people ignoring CDC recommendations, they could decide to close or limit visitation...please be safe and considerate of others...act as if it was your own life that depends on the safety recommendations."
I'll see you July 12th. Hope things have calmed down by then.
