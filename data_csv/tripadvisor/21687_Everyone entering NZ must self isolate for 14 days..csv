You must self isolate for 14 days https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coro…
"As of midnight Sunday ever person arriving will have to isolate themselves for 14 days, Ardern says. That will mean New Zealand will have the strongest restrictions expect the Pacific Islands."
Who will enforce it? And how? What are the penalties for not complying?
Pity the Australian Govt lack the initiative to do same in order to contain this disease.What do you expect though when they are puppets of the US.Goodnight for NZ tourism for the present time.
#2 why would you not comply for the sake of someones life?
"we have plan trip to NZ from 26th march to 8 april. and all our booking is no refundable. based on the criteria, all tour is effectively suspended since no one can travel in group or eat in restaurant."
"#5 I had two months dream holiday planned for italy. been planning for a year. Arranged for cover at work, arranged for someone to stay in our house. It cost us $6000 to cancel as some hotels and tour operators and airlines wont refund. Our travel insurance advises they wont cover as it is our choice to cancel.It is happening the world over and costing alot of people their savings."
"#4 Did I say I was not going to comply?I haven't been out of NZ for six months, I said who is going to police the incoming people to self isolate and what are the penalties for not complying? - read what I actually wrote.Edited: 1:01 am, March 14, 2020 "
"This is nonsense, where are people going to self isolate ? In the hotels or in hired campervans or for residents, in their homes. Our already fragile health system in New Zealand cannot afford a partial open borders policy.The only consolation for NZ is that maybe it is already too late to close the borders."
"Sad day for tourism in New Zealand. Hopefully, a recovery/support plan will be put in place when all of this is over."
"Upon further reading from the governments website, self isolation does not necessarily means 2 weeks sitting in in hotel room.""Self-isolation means staying away from situations where you could infect other people. This means any situation where you may come in close contact with others (face to face contact closer than 1 metre for more than 15 minutes), such as social gatherings, work, school (...)If you are a visitor to New Zealand, this means you should avoid sitting in a restaurant, or participating in any type of tour group.If you are unsure if you should be self-isolating, or if you do not know where you can go, please contact Healthline for free on 0800 358 5453.""https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases…"
"this advise is more toward those ""listed country"" eg iran, italy, france, sg etc etc.. since now ALL traveller are ADVISED to self isolate, how practical is it for everyone to maintain 1m apart from each other, or avoid eating in restaurant, or joining tour group??"
Totally agree. Just saying that is less severe than staying in your hotel room and that some form of travel is possible.
"Tourists having to self isolate is nonsense. Many visitors only have 2 weeks to visit NZ - they won't be coming to spend all their time isolated.Might as well just ban all tourists.Edited: 1:53 am, March 14, 2020 "
#14 Exactly!
"#13 i agree. hotels cant be a self isolating facility cause they would just be a big hotspot. its not really practical,"
"It is alright to say self isolate but no one on the forum has stated the bleeding obvious ""HOW IS IT GOING TO BE POLICED""I don't see the police fitting monitors to everyone's legs to see where they travel to."
"Better to take a hit in tourism than have our health system crash. The death rate is 10 times that of flu.Great to see strong action take.Guy across road from me was in self isolation returning from China. He went for a run every night until someone (not me) reported him. He had a ""please explain"" and the offer of a holiday in motor home on a naval bsse."
A bit more on what self isolation means:https:/…
"#17, if I read the government's website correctly (might not..) than he was perfectly ok going for a run."
"What does entering the country mean? We have a flight from Australia to Auckland and then transfer on Air Tahiti to PPT. Assuming we get required medical certificate, we should be able to get to French Polynesia. But our travel agent secured a New Zealand visa for us, implying we are entering the country. So will they keep us in the country for 14 days even though we only intended to change planes in Auckland?"
"nzpOppy because many people think “I’m all right it doesn’t apply to me”. The anti social and criminal types do not suddenly become law abiding conformists because of an emergency.The strong advice is not to cancel anything, the situation around the world is changing daily. The flight you cancel today and take a hit on maybe cancelled by the airline or government next week allowing for full refunds.Edited: 4:45 am, March 14, 2020 "

"What a nightmare! We are due to arrive on Monday morning (so just after this new ruling is being implemented) and have just heard this news. We have been in Australia for the last 6 months so not exactly in a coronavirus hotspot. Whilst I understand and appreciate this new implementation its completely impractical for us to self isolate for two weeks - where are we supposed to stay, how do we get food, how can I absolutely guarantee I won't come within 1 meter of another human being, etc? We don't have any intentions of lying about our movements when we go through immigration, but out of interest does anyone have any idea what the response will be on arrival if we detail out our movements for the first 14 days of our stay and advise we will be staying out of restaurants, confined/indoor tourist attractions, etc? Will they force us to stay in a hotel quarantined with a bunch of other tourists? Or will they refuse us entry and send us back to Australia?Sorry, I know this is an unknown situation but some insight in to the workings of the NZ immigration and health system is helpful!"
"@23 - no one knows of course because this was only announced a few hours ago. However I don't think the intention is that you would have to be put into qurantine. Its more that you avoid groups (including tour groups), concerts, big events, sports matchs and similar. You can talk to other people but not for long period of time. Obviously avoid groups of older more vulnerable people. Don't go to a dr's surgery or hospital if you are unwell with a cough - they will give you the number to call on arrival. I'd suggest hiring a car would be a good idea"
"Staying at home or, for people already in NZ, getting home asap is an even better idea though tbf."
"@24 thank you so much for your response - I was hoping the self isolation was more of a 'keep away from people' policy rather than 'stay indoors and don't leave for 2 weeks'. And yes we have a car booked for the whole trip :)Its just myself and my boyfriend coming - we are independent travellers and never do tour groups, major tourist sights, etc and we always stay in Airbnbs so we can cook meals instead of eating at restaurants so we are really unlikely to come in to contact with anyone for any amount of time. This is our second time to NZ and have been so excited, we are just coming for hiking and scenery, not interested in tour groups :) intend to ring Air NZ tomorrow to try get some clarification from them.Edited: 6:28 am, March 14, 2020 "
"The YHA New Zealand have just posted this on their Facebook page:“ Covid-19 UpdateYou may have seen that all international travellers (except for those from the Pacific Islands) are now required to self-isolate for 14 days if arriving in New Zealand after midnight on 15 March.YHA Hostels are communal living spaces which is an awesome way to travel, meet new friends and save money but not so great for self-isolation. We are simply not able to accommodate any international guests arriving after 15 March.It's frustrating for everyone but we understand why. Hopefully for those guests we have to disappoint, we hope you understand too.”"
"We are are inbound to Christchurch from UK in early April and outbound 12 nights later from Auckland and have a motorhome booked to tour in.What does this guidance actually mean for tourists like us, can we actually travel around or are we meant to sit still in our motorhome! but then how do we get to our outbound flight.Would of made more sense to ban all people with out a permanent NZ address from entering than the muddle now created"
"I don't understand this ""self-isolation"". From reading previous responses on this thread, you wouldn't be allowed to go to restaurants. So visitors on self-isolation are expected to self cater? Does this mean going to the grocery store and pushing around a cart collecting groceries is expected? Wouldn't the handles of the cart be contaminated if they have Covid-19?And what about pumping petrol? How many hands are on that pump each day? If visitors in self-isolation are okay to drive around, they'll have to pump petrol too.New Zealand really needs to think this through and come up with serious and clear guidelines as to what those in self-isolation can and cannot do."
"It might be more helpful, for all, if tourists were simply banned. In that case, many more would be able to get refunds either through their travel providers or travel insurance.Was planning a trip to NZ but will postpone. As best possible, hope all are safe as we work to weather this storm."
I have friends who left late Saturday out of lax. Will they be included? Did they miss the quarantine if they arrived before 11:59?
"Couldn’t agree more- the current approach prevents insurance claims because (in our case UK) travel advice to NZ remains unchanged while the NZ policy isn’t an outright ban, so we either face losing the £6k+ we’ve put down on our trip or we continue with plans but face ethical questions on that decision as well as the challenges of self isolating, with rules that are quite vague on movements/interactions etc. As others have pointed out, you can’t hole up in a hotel because that is a risk, but so is moving around. Yet we stand to lose a lot of money because the directive has been framed in a way that doesn’t enable people to activate insurance policies!"
"My thoughts are with New Zealanders, and the tourism industry. I am currently planning a month long trip for next year ( America's Cup). I am grateful that the Cup is not happening now, for there would be a HUGE loss of tourism money. I am on the East Coast of the US and so far, its not so bad, with social distancing, etc. . . but we are expecting and preparing for the worst next week and after. . .what is happening in Italy is very likely going to happen here :("
"i was due to fly to italy for two months. been planning it for two years lost $6000 in deposits. So changed our plans so we would visit family in USA, but even that is in doubt now. we have someone staying in our house for two months. And arranged for temp cover for both of us at work our own busiiness.. Its affecting lots of people, businesses, communities.Fear is contagious as well.The stupid thig is the 14 days isolation is from midnight tonight. I have two friends who been overseas and cut holidays early to fly back today to avoid the self isolation. which mens they could have the virus and are free to travel around"
"Post #30, a full ban would be a next step - but I would think we're trying to avoid that - think of all the consequences and logistics...*It's well known that there isn't enough runway space to land all aeroplanes. *Our citizens will be trapped away from NZ.*All sorts of implications for people with their visas - outstaying visa periods etc. *Industries - businesses that will suddenly have no income - business going broke, people with no incomesWe're a small country, and while government is putting in place and promising financial aid - we've only so much money, that'll only go so far... We as humans need to take a bit of responsibility and reduce chances of spreading disease to those whose immune systems cannot withstand it. In the scheme of things, losing a few dollars and being restricted in travel internationally is an inconvenience, at least you're still alive. Climate warriors should be happy too - we've already seen the reduction in pollution from China - and this will force everyone to become more locally minded - using and supporting local produce and industry. Our tourism industry is already encouraging domestic tourism - which IMO is brilliant. .... those be my thoughts, and that be my rant... :-) happy Sunday people ... I WAS going on a Hot Air Balloon flight this morn, but the company has suspended operation until May :-("
"My suggestion was a tourist ban, not a ban on NZ citizens returning home. So no NZ citizens trapped away from home. By banning tourists:1. The would-be tourist would possibly get money back, to be spent on a future trip to NZ. As it stands now, refunds for cancelled trips are very unlikely. 2. The ban would be prospective; preventing arrivals from date x. Visas would be dealt with as they always are.3. There are plenty of places to park airplanes worldwide.And don't understand the rest of your post relative to banning foreign tourists. That seems a better way to prevent disease spread, and to get money back to the tourists who want to spend it in NZ."
"Yes, we are leaving uncertain times...My 50th B-day turned out to be a year to remember (or forget?). Our trip is booked and scheduled for late December. We'll see how things are by then. Tickets are not refundable (bummer) but most of the hotel reservations are, so..."
Love your post Pineapple.We need diversify our ecconomy a bit more. Its like 1973 all over again. Too many eggs in too few baskets.
"Earthquakes, roads and bridges washed out, and now this.NZ has had some low blows in the last few years. Best wishes to you all, and hope for a better run of luck in future."
"Thanks HaddawayThe entire planet needs some luck and fortitude to get through this. On the bright side, domestic tourism should be easier as fewer places will be fully booked.Stay safe everyone :)"
"So if an international traveler decides to come to New Zealand in the next 2 weeks (or longer, we shall see), what are they supposed to do?I saw a reference to register with Healthline. Is that going to be something they have to do when going through CQI? Or is it on the honor system?Most of the articles I've read about self-isolation tend to be for residents. They list examples of public places being ""social gatherings, work, school, child care/pre-school centres, university, polytechnic and other education providers, faith-based gatherings, aged care and health care facilities, prisons, sports gatherings, restaurants and all public gatherings.""These aren't places tourists usually go to. I imagine tourists wouldn't be allowed on tours, public buses, restaurants in those 14 days. Would they be allowed on domestic flights? Are they expected to stay in a hotel room and order Uber Eats or the like? Maybe go out for a walk or a drive in their rental car, but not interact with anyone - at least not in close range. But what about the interaction with the clerk at the car hire, or the staff at the hotel's registration desk?Or is this just a way to tell tourists not to come, without banning them from doing so? It seems like there are notices of restrictions without offering up what they can do."
"the detail of self isolation will be out on tuesday local time which is too late for us, we are schedule to arrive on 26th this month. no choice, we had to cancel all our booking. for airbnb, guest initiated cancellation is 50% refundable, 100% oy if host AGREED. host has to approve for 100% refund case. please talk to your host. we try to get full refund for those longer stay or more than 100/200 USD.Edited: 7:37 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"The point of this, for those not totally following (not trying to be rude) is that it is border control without actual border control. They cant ban all flights because they get a lot of goods/medicines/etc.. on commercial flights. So by requiring visitors to self isolate for 14 days... Jacinda Arden is counting on people not coming without literally locking down their country. Because who wants to spend their vacation on lockdown? No one. How do you go on holiday without being close to people? You don't. So we cancel/reschedule. I recommend reading a few articles on it all from NZ news. If you're booked with a company that is currently saying that your flight/tour/hotel is saying is non-refundable, ask for a voucher or credit good for 1 year so you can rebook. Assuming you're not out right canceling, you could reschedule for a better time for everyone. Most likely if you a tell a company what's going on, they would be happy not to lose your business entirely, but to give you a credit to use for later. Or if they wont, ask for a 50% refund and tell them you'll find another hotel when you do travel to NZ. They may sing a different song. It sucks guys. I'm postponing my dream trip to NZ (have been planning and waiting to go for FIVE years) but this isn't just about us. This is about slowing the spread of a virus that's overwhelming many countries healthcare systems, it's about protecting the citizen's of New Zealand and their elderly, immunocompromised, medically compromised citizens."
"its a total joke. If the govt of NZ was serious about protecting our vunerable it would have been immediate.the horse has bolted. thousands and thousands are streaming into nz today. Air nz has put on bigger planes to cope.So why are thousands arriving today and dont have to self isolate, when those arriving tomorrow may have coronavirus and do?"
"The ""thousands"" returning today are Kiwi returning home."
"To the earlier tourist questions, I would not consider touring the country in a campervan as self isolation. You have to shop for food and for petrol at the very least. If I cant do that as a resident (go shopping) you cannot feasibly isolate yourself whilst touring around. It's a harsh reality."
Australia has now taken New Zealand's lead.https:/…12057772
"@ post 32 Rod1581Similar position, insurance won't cover as it's not a ban. Being told contradicting statements by our motorhome company like:""In simple terms, self-isolation means you will not be able to move freely around the country and ""avoid experiences, malls, supermarkets"" How is it possible to avoid a supermarket when we are self catering?They go to say:""Self-isolation does not mean that you cannot leave your motorhome""But as no free country travel are they suggesting we collect our motorhome then sit in it in the parking lot?Our collection is Christchurch but our drop off is Auckland if we cannot move around the country how is that possible?NZ are massively pissing off tourists to protect business paying out."
Also tried calling the NZ health advisory line yesterday- was on hold for 45mins and then it just cut. Been charged £80 for it! I think we’ll probably have to cancel but it’s just so frustrating that the advisory’s been done in a way that means we can’t claim insurance so stand to lose thousands of hard-earned pounds we’d put to this holiday as a once-in-a-lifetime trip
"£7.5k spent, UK FCO need to give advice no to travel so insurance becomes valid, this advice from NZ and Aus has been carefully worded so airlines and their business keep our cash."
"This coming soon in the UK (from the Guardian)... In the coming weeks, over-70’s will be asked to self-isolate for up to four months, in order to protect them from the virus...bloomin heck"
"Rod and Mat, I feel for you, I really do. It would certainly help our valued visitors if a ban was placed. I don't really know why it has been done this way - perhaps if a ban was placed airlines would instantly stop flying, while this current wishy washy 'self isolation' means the airlines keep flying for at least a few days and Kiwis are able to fly home and tourists are able to leave. One disadvantage to being an island nation, we rely on flying to come and go - the advantge to our isolation is it might help keep virus victim numbers low."
"@WLnzAgree, I hope the next few days NZ residents can get home, tourists can leave then NZ Govt move to stop all tourists and just allow NZ residents and airlines continue with reduced service to accommodate. This would seem the logical next steps to then allow impacted tourists heading to NZ to claim on insurance, not doing this gives the impression NZ Govt using tourists as cash cow to keep economy moving for at least the short term and many would question whether to ever want to go to NZ again."
"#55 i agree. but we have the reverse. we cancelled our europe 2 month holiday (never taken two months off work before and was a huge year planning as we own our own business). My partner never wants to go to Europe again, as it has cost us in five figures in lost deposits, and thats not even including staff we have employed and trained at work to cover us and we not going"
"While everyone's frustration is understandable, you should really be directing your anger at the Insurance companies and airlines for sticking to the small print in their policies, instead of taking a more altruistic approach to this unprecedented situation. The NZ govt, and other governments which have imposed similar restrictions are following a ""best practice"" approach to an evolving situation, which has not yet reached the point where closing the borders is necessary. It still may come to that. We will just have to wait and hope."
We reluctantly decided to cancel/postpone our upcoming holiday but plan to rearrange it for this time next year (a loooong time to wait).We've been amazed at how accommodating most people have been about refunding our costs...motels and other accommodation places have been brilliant. Also Apex have fully refunded so thanks very much to them.I'm struggling to contact Air New Zealand (domestic flight) and Coastal Pacific trains but am hoping for the best.It is annoying that it's not an outright ban meaning that insurance companies will need to pay up but hopefully everyone else is having as much good fortune as me.
Well Air NZ has cut back 85% of long haul flight. I think only Auckland to LAX is left. It wont be long before other airlines follow suit. There is a reasonable chance your flights will be cancelled.
"It looks (fingers crossed) that we’re going to get away tomorrow to go home. I’ve been nervous since the NZ announcement re self isolating that Thai Airlines might stop their AKL flights but it’s listed as leaving BKK at 7pm tonight (1am NZ time) so it should be going back tomorrow afternoon. So a 43 hour journey back to Manchester via BKK, ICN and LHR beckons with maybe self isolating to follow. But at least I’m only 67 so it should only be two weeks. Both our neighbours and a number of friends will be under “house arrest” though. Strange and tough times."
You have been so lucky with your timings John. Hopefully this hasn't spoilt your holiday at all.It's crazy what effect a tiny virus has on the world... Good luck with the journey!
"Good news John, hope the flight routing works out for you, lengthy though it is. Difficult times indeed."
"Safe traves home John and AnneIt has been a pleasure travelling with you around NZ, through your TR."
We have indeed been very very lucky. The virus hasn’t really affected us other than some phone calls and low level fretting about flights.I’m way behind on the trip report but one way or another I should have plenty of time to catch up soon!
#65 all the best with your travels home.
Have a safe trip John!
">>It's crazy what effect a tiny virus has on the world...<<If you are old enough to remember ""War of the Worlds"", then you remember missiles couldn't slay the Martians.
