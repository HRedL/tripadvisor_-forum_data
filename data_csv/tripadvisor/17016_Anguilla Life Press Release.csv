Press Release from Hon. Victor Banks re recent robberies:anguillalife.com/news/stories/local/12159.phpEllen
"Ellen,Many thanks for this...i guess this is Veya?"
"Yes, our beloved Veya was hit particularly hard, with both the wonderful owners suffering injuries in the attack, but are now recovering and have plans to open on Monday. Other recent robberies have been at Barrel Stay and Luna Rosa, and the now closed Caprice, all took place at, or after closing when everyone but Staff had left. Mango Dave was attacked at his home. Although I do think Bank's press release is a bit weak, I think it is in the right direction and they have finally realized that they need to do something to combat the terror, robberies, and senseless attacks. How they follow through remains to be answered, and I hope it is not just another propaganda piece and they end up sweeping everything under the rug. Tourists need to realize and understand that is this not the same old Anguilla, they need to be aware. Just because you are on Anguilla, does not mean you can let your guard down. Be aware, be proactive, do not conduct yourself any different than you would at home. The life you save may be your own.Ellen"
"After the horrible crime events about 1 1/2 years ago the Police Force brought in 4 highly experienced police officers from the UK. Their work seems to have been efficient, and the crime rate went down quite a lot. I read a very positive press release in the local paper at Christmas time.However, again it is happening, and I sincerely hope they have caught the criminals and give them a severe sentence.The islanders are also concerned, and fear news like this will have a negative impact on tourism."
"Until they change their island credo of Don't See/Don't Tell, you aren't going to see all that much of a change IMO. These things seem to come in spates. Perhaps this one is over for a bit and we can relax till the next time (and you KNOW there will be a next time).I still maintain that, as islands go, AXA is still safer than the majority."
"I agree Pepper! AT says they have two in custody, one is a 17 year old ""from a good family"". Hope that doesn't mean he will get off because of his connections.Ellen"
What a load of politico-speak that press release is!!! They actually think the RAPF is doing a good job....Hahahaha.It is truly amazing that these thugs are permitted to get away with this type of activity. I'm sure the 17 yr old will be treated as a juvenile and get off with a slap on the wrist. I read some of the stories in the Anguillian about the sentences handed out to the very few individuals that were caught after the last crime wave and they were ridiculously soft.Let's find out if Rudy Giuliani would be interested in an extended vaca in paradise!
"If you want to get the real skinny, go to Don's latest post on his blog. As usual, he is the true voice of Anguilla."
"Seems as if there is trouble everywhere in the Caribbean:ybw.com/auto/newsdesk/20090029174222supersaiâ€¦Anguilla still seems the best of all worlds, but I'll tell you, reading some of the comments by purported Locals on AT, leaves me shaking my head. As usual, Don Mitchell is not afraid to post about the inept police force, and their bumbling ways.Too bad the Island's people aren't more concerned about what is happening there; my impression is the Ex-Pats and Tourists care more about what is going on than the Locals.Ellen"
Has anyone else observed with discomfort that it seems like only non-local restaurants and restaurateurs were tapped for robberies?
"Actually, I take it back. Koal Keel is now among the victims."
Dale Carty from Tastys was robbed at his home after closing up his restaurant one night -- I think that was last season.
what is the link for Don's blog? Thank you 
"Yes, I just read that about Tasty's. (Getting to be an epidemic, eh?)http://corruptionfreeanguilla.blogspot.com/"
Where does everyone get their scoop...what happened at Koal Keel???
Look at the Blogspot address in the above posts and also check out anguillatalk.com. Dale I heard about from Dale.
"Actually, very little - it was a burglary, not a robbery - early morning hours. The restaurant was long closed, and very little was taken."
This whole thing has made very nervous.We have a trip booked in early march.Never been there before was really excited but now i'm concerned.Should I cancel my trip? 
"I am going at the same time and have not one single thought about canceling my trip. In fact, I am looking forward to getting out of this freezing cold.This will make my 25th time to the island and frankly, I can't wait to get there. I know AXA is relatively safe as Caribbean islands go. Any place out of your home environment is always a possible risk of some sort. I don't know where you are planning to stay but know one thing -- they are not touting travelers because our credit cards are no good to them and very little in the way of money is carried to restaurants.Relax and enjoy. You're in for a treat."
"I will be there in 6 weeks, would never dream of canceling. Can hardly wait.Ellen"
"Cancel your trip? And, I suspect, you'll find another island with NO crime whatsoever? The reason this is newsworthy is that Anguilla has been relatively free of crime. It still is a safe place to vacation. These recent events appears to be targeted at restauranteurs. I have read about attacks on tourists, but I think they are more rare. I guess the best best is to dine at times the establishments are busier - not at closing.Have a great trip!"
I know what was I thinking cancelling.We are so going.Staying At KU got a great deal on Luxury Link.Saw some mixed posts about it but all we really want is a great beach and a clean room.Funny all our dinner reservations are at the places that were hit.
You should go with the anticipation that you'll have an incredible time on a beautiful beach with a great choice of restaurants. Safety rules apply in Anguilla as they do in any place with people. Enjoy your trip - and GO STEELERS!
