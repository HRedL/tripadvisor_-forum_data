There's been no running water in parts of Malang for a month. How can I take a shower or use the toilet? How can i find clean food if i know nothing can be washed? I'm worried about hygiene. Am I at risk of a public health incident?
"Food wise, restaurant will buy fesh water in reusable container or tank. Eat and drink anything that is hot.Drink only bottled water and use ice that is made by an ice factory (the shape is regular and uniform) locally made ice will is crashed by hand so it has irregular shape and size"
"Hi RichardIf you don't have any access to bathroom and toilet facilities and don't absolutely have to stay there for any urgent reason, then you would be well advised to leave. Apart from it being an obvious personal health risk, it would also be extremely difficult and uncomfortable."
"@richardgday,Are you a resident of a tourist? If latter - just get out of there. Why are you staying in the place that is on the verge of epidemics and NOT leaving it?"
I only came for a wedding. Had to collect rainwater from the roof to flush the toilet. Worst holiday ever! Don't come to Malang or Indonesia. The most basic requirements of human survival are unavailable here. I understand there is still no running water.
"That's really sad to hear, Richardgday. We were in Malang in June this year and thought it was a lovely place with warm and hospitable people. I do hope that the problem can be resolved quickly. Have there been any reports from authorities as to the reason?"
"@richardgday,I'm really sorry to hear that your travel was ruined by the local conditions."
