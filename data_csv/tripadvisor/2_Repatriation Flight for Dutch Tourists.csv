On 30 March (Monday) KLM will provide an extra repatriation flight for Dutch Citizens stuck because of COVID19 restrictions. The flight is from Ngurah Rai International Airport (Bali) to Amsterdam. Departure time 21:20. Seats are still available for order from the KLM website.
"Sorry, here’s the link from the Netherlands Embassy in Indonesia.https:/…"
"It's pretty good to see this happening although it won't be without any tricky logistics - what happens if any of them have It? Still, 10 points to KLM and the Dutch government."
"The last of three flights to Germany leave later today also. Hopefully most German tourists and those expats wanting to leave will have gone.Edited: 10:22 pm, March 29, 2020 "
"Out of curiosity, what will happen to the people who don't want to leave or just don't bother trying to get on the plane?"
You mean the last of three repatriaton flights?Because Qatar and Garuda still fly to Europe
"Garuda fly to Amsterdam and Netherland has not many positive Covid-19 patients.In mainland Europe the area which has many positive Covid-19 patients are Italy, southern Germany, France near Germany and Spain."
"Totally irrelevant, Sarwa."
"First of all @Sarwa please do not post nonsense.In the Netherlands are 12.595 postivive tests on Corona on a population of 17+ million. Do you know how small my country is? And what if this will be compared to countries like Spain, France or German? I think the ratio will be even higher at the end.Like said, this is totally irrelevant for this topic.This is about a repatriation flight for Dutch people, who want to go home.Second:There is another repatriation flight tomorrow 2nd April with KLM as well KL82602-04-2020DPS – AMS departure 21.20 to be booked via www.klm.com"
