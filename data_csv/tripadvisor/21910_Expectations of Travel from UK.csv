"Just wondering what peoples expectations are of when it will be likely for Holidays to be allowed to the regions of koh Pha Ngan,Samui & Phuket from the UK ?"
"Honestly, your guess is as good as the next persons.No one had any idea when international commercial flights will start up again, and what countries may or may not be excluded, so actually try and put a date on when travel from the UK will be allowed is rather pointless at the time being."
Yes I agree. I was mainly trying to get a local view if honest but didnt explain that in my original post.
"We all want to get back to Thailand, but I would just wait & see what happensThe Thai & UK Govts don't know, local Thai people will know less than we do about UK travel restrictionsI've no idea, same as everybody else, but hope I will be going in Jan/Feb 2021 as normal, but certainly not 100% certain thats going to happenlets keep our fingers crossed"
"Over recent days and weeks one or two regulars have posted at length on this subject outlining in considerable detail their views on how and when Thailand will reopen to foreign visitors. However it has all been speculation, educated guesswork - call it what you will. Those in charge in Thailand make the decisions. At the moment the authorities are anti foreigners as evidenced by simple things like the opening of Wat Pho to Thais only - foreigners specifically banned. The reason given is to prevent Covid19 infection. Also I believe that (some) inter city buses are not currently allowing foreigners on board.We can only wait and see."
"Yes I saw that non Thai's not allowed on the government buses. Ian posted on Facebook they were not allowed on the Bangkok to Trat route. Also saw Korat not allowing non Thai ex pats on some of their buses.Hard to tell when the Brits will be allowed back in Thailand but assume due to having one of the biggest death rates in the world we will be one of the last countries.Heard someone talking on one of the forums say that China and Vietnam will be the first tourists allowed in I've already given up hope of November and highly doubt my planned trip January/February 2021 will go ahead. Certainly wont be booking or planning anything until autumn. Some of my neighbours and teacher colleagues who have already booked family trips planned to Spain and the med in school holidays starting next month may be in for a disappointment. The Brits will find it hard going anywhere for a while yet. It's a case of watch this space July/August see if Brits can go to Europe easily. Then hopefully later in the year things will open for far east Asia.Edited: 8:27 pm, June 11, 2020 "

I think it maybe that a number of people think that there is 'a secret sauce (source).They do not trust their own government agencies so would they trust other governments' agencies.I worked in a government agency many years ago. People would pretend not to speak English so they could get to talk to their own people. The problem was that their own people in the agency didn't want to talk to them because they would asked and seen as people who somehow be able to take care of of their own people. They got sick of being asked to provide favours
"Relax people its only a simple question to get a rough idea/feeling, If you read the original post and because this is a forum I was asking what 'peoples expectations' are."
"I don't think any of us can have any expectation, six months ago nobody expected that we would all be put in lockdown and our economies stuffed, but here we are. My expectation is that here in Australian we may well be able to travel to Thailand before those in the UK as we have currently got the virus under control, so there has been talk of a travel bubble between us and some Asian countries, whether that actually happens remains to be seen as we can't even go across the border at the moment."
"***off topic post***""we can't even go across the border at the moment""Just read today that the NSW and QLD border restrictions will be finishing on the 15thYahoooooI've been missing my Qld friends so much, will be great to be able to see them againEdited: 7:04 am, June 12, 2020 "
"""Countries like the UK and USA with high rates of infections are going to be low on the list.""The death rate in the US is not that high, about half the rate in the UK. Only Spain and Belgum have higher rates than the UK and a few tiny countries which are statistical blips.You can bet you life countries will be playing the numbers game once the restrictions are eased and quite frankly who would be welcoming people fro the UK with a truly appalling covid record."
"Hi !It has been reported in the Thai media that countries such as China, Japan and South Korea (ALL countries where Covid 19 has been efficiently and successfully managed !) are keen to create a ""Travel Bubble"" with Thailand, effectively opening the possibility of tourists entering Thailand again for these countries.These countries also mostly visit Thailand as large tour groups which would also be easier to manage through ""track and trace."" I therefore believe that it could be sometime before independant tourists are permitted to visit.As for tourists from the UK, regretably with still one of the highest levels of Covid 19 infections in the world and an incompetent PM and government that has mismanaged the pandemic on a massive and negligent scale (over 40,000 deaths !), it is likely to be sometime before Thailand will be happy to welcome tourists again from the UK !Stay safe all !"
As long as the downward curve continues then would expect certainly the winter months to be good to go for all tourists.
"#15 As long as the downward curve continues then would expect certainly the winter months to be good to go for all tourists.""Maybe? But all depends upon a second wave of Covid 19 infections, that most of the scientists are predicting WILL happen, probably during the coming ""winter months""Stay safe all !"
"""China, Japan and South Korea (ALL countries where Covid 19 has been efficiently and successfully managed !)""China has been very successful at pulling the wool over everybody's eyes. They didn't even lockdown Wuhan until after the start of the Chinese New Year an the whole of the country was free to go where ever they liked.

"""I believe Thailand are in for a shock, if they believe just by opening the borders you will see millions come back. Not going to happen. People will be neverous, major recessions going on around the world, tourist is going to take a big hit.After 9/11 which was an incident in America, the worldwide effects on tourism were crushing. Same with the 2008 financial crash. ""Then you need to look at the statistics. 2009 the figures were only down 3% on 2008 and 2009 was an an increase on 2008.What I have learnt about predictions on Thai tourist numbers on the internet is that they are always wrong. I do accept that this is a bigger deal than 2008 though."
2002 figures were actually up on 2001 but 2003 was down on 2002. By 2004 they were exceeding the 2002 figure. https:/…
"With 2003 you had the additional impact of SARS which stopped a lot of East Asian countries populations travelling. I remember being in Thailand in February/March 2003 and tourism was definitely down compared to previous years.Even if the borders open here tomorrow with no restrictions, a lot of countries still have 'all but essential travel' in place which will affect insurance cover, not many people are going to get on a plane from Europe, US and Australia. Also, although a lot more is open (here on Samui anyway) it's still not normal and a lot of restaurants are still closed as are hotels. It will be interesting to see what happens next week when bars are allowed to open."
"I was looking to spend a few days in Koh Samui next week.The accommodation is extremely cheap now and I was all set to go but then I checked the cost of the flight from Bangkok to Koh Samui.The accommodation for 3 people for 4 days at a resort on a beach was a very reasonable 7,500 baht. The cost of the return airfare is 23,000 baht.Koh Samet via bus is far more reasonable notwithstanding the extra accommodation costs."
I seem to remember that the last prediction that Thailand was going to completely collapse was following the death of the King. The Crown Prince was so disliked there even stories he would be bumped off.The thing that I have learned following 20 odd years of following various travel sites is that every prediction has been completely wrong.

"I am not sure what that is supposed to be showing Take the UK, to compare cases we would have to have like for like testing. The US has 5 times the population of the UK but the US has 36 times as many tests as the UK. Just shows that the UK is total rubbish at testing, but then everything about the UK and the virus has been rubbish."
"@Cam and Craig I will repeat for the third time the numbers after the country e.g. UK = 4 is not the number of deaths it is the position of the UK in the ""league table"" of deaths per million maybe I should have put 4th, 9th etc to make it clearer."
"Ok gotcha MickI think we can all agree then that US, UK and Brazil are the three worst countries at handling this pandemic of all the major countries. Trump and his two proteges BJ and Bolsonaro LOL"
Craig I certainly agree with you on that score and given that the virus didn't really start spreading in Brazil until after the UK and the US i can see them being the worst of the lot.
"Using deaths as a guide for worst infected countries is not very useful when it comes to international travel situation. Countries opening borders will be looking at total infections, because that's their concern, whether people who might come to their country could bring the virus with them. They will also not base decisions only on numbers anyway, there will be plenty of other issues considered and some may not be rational. For Thailand particularly, it's almost certain some of their decisions won't be rational."
I take it you mean current infections not total of all infections and recovered. How will they know that for the UK which doesn't carry out mass tests?Do you seriously believe China only had a total of 83000 cases and now they have another wave. Yet the US and the UK are the bad boys.
"""I think we can all agree then that US, UK and Brazil are the three worst countries at handling this pandemic of all the major countries.""You are reading the stats incorrectly. Belgium is worse than the UK. Spain was slight worse than the UK but the UK have overtaken them.Belgium and Spain or Italy don't factor in your assessment. I agree that the UK Government are a disgrace at handling this."
"@Cam didnt really think of Belgium as a major country. Yes Spain and Italy are worse than US for now but the Americans have been totally inept at getting this under control and will likely catch Italy and Spain on a per capita basis. Big states like Cali, Texas and Fla still rising...."
"We are fairly optimistic to make our 1st trip to Thailand in February ""21, however, not so much through any pandemic that causes us to have any doubts but the general feeling that worldwide instability is getting worse."

The tracking app is actually one of the most effective tools but it needs to be implemented quickly. Taiwan and South Korea both were very quick to launch their apps and they nipped the virus in the bud.
"Tracking apps and vaccines for something with a 99.5 percent recovery rate should tell the thinking person all is not quite as it seems. My only expectations are expect the unexpected in general, apart from the obvious collapsing of countries economies, sad times for the free world."

"Given the current situation it is difficult to see how not touching on the political situation can be avoided since it is the politicians that are driving how we got into this mess and how we are going to get out of it.Speculation and people's views my be interesting but have no bearing on what is going to happen.Some like South Korea and Germany are managing extremely well.
