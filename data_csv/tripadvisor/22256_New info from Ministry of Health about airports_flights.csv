https://www.gov.tc/moh/coronavirus/guidance/…Looks like the quarantine requirement has been quietly dropped. It used to be at https:/…airtravel which is now a dead link
"Thanks for the update, appreciate it."
It does say that they need to present documentation that they are covid free and if they can’t they will then need to quarantine for 14 days.
"#2 Not trying to be argumentative but I don't read it that way. The language ""All regional and international sea travelers must wear masks and present a medical certificate showing they are Covid-19 free and their travel itinerary. If unable to present a medical certificate they would be subjected to a 14-day quarantine at their expense."" is under ""Reopening of TCI seaports"". No idea if that includes airports as the language is not in the ""Reopening of TCI airports"" section of the regulation/guidance . I have no idea, not a lawyer. I will write the MoH for clarification but won't expect any kind of reply. I'll share if I do.Edited: 8:21 pm, June 10, 2020 "
"Presenting documentation is absurd. They could be ""cleared"" on a Monday morning, pick up the virus that night, then fly out the next day and infect everyone. Not to mention that airports and planes are like petri dishes for viruses and bacteria. While i applaud taking precautions this is a step that would do absolutely no good."
"I was just focusing on them saying ""international"" so maybe that is not the case."
My understanding is that in Western culture it's impolite to shoot the messenger. The MoH can be contacted via email at covid19@gov.tcIf anyone gets clarity on the quarantine or any other issue please do share on the forum. or this thread. I am sure as the opening date of 22 July for airports gets closer there will be further information available from both the TCI Government and the airlines.
#5 no worries. It certainly might have been written differently. Like I said I will reach out to MoH and see if I can get better info. Doubt I'll get a response but if I do will share. Anyone who IS a lawyer care to offer a pro bono opinion?
It sure does Happybubbles! Looks like we have to fill in a questioner and wear a mask and stay 6 feet apart!
Did you miss the part where it says the Provo airport will remain closed to regional and international flights?
"#9 Mama Osa these are just the protocols , standards or guidelines for when the airport does open which is scheduled for 22 July. The opening date itself is not in the guidelines but has been announced by the Hon. Premier. There is a list of all current guidelines/standards and protocols, some of which may still be changed or modified in the coming weeks at: https://www.gov.tc/moh/coronavirus/guidance/"
"This link is updated continually by IATA. The world map shows restrictions for each country. Click on the country to get the official (latest) information. For TCI is shows ""airport closed"". However, for many countries it gives detailed information all in one place. https:/…1580226297.htm"
"#9 My sincere apologies, I did indeed miss it. So plain it's invisible to me. Under Reopening ofTCI airports it says: ""Providenciales International Airport to remain closed to regional and international flights.Airports open to domestic flights only and these flights should be limited to four flights per day."" I have sent emails asking about this and testing and quarantines. I have to believe the above is a mistake, like someone forgot to add until 22 July or some such."
"So I have heard back from the Moh. NB the last line. I have no idea how they would enforce it.Regarding closure of airport the language is an oversight. The Airport will be open to International travel on 22 JulyI asked two questions. Will testing be required and do you have to quarantine? Answer is .......At the moment, we have not issued specific protocols for non-resident international travellers, but our protocols are under continuous review and can be found on our coronavirus website under the guidance section: www.gov.tc/moh/coronavirus/guidance. New guidance will be issued soon and please bear in mind that these are subject to change on short notice.Once the Turks and Caicos Islands Airports are reopened on 22 July, under current guidance the following will be required of youSocial distancing must remain in place at all airport premises. Persons must stand a distance of 6ft a part.All air travellers must wear masks/face coverings. This is also required in all public places.All travellers entering the TCI must complete the Ministry of Health, Covid-19 Health Questionnaire and may be subject to additional screening if necessary.As previously stated, additional guidance is expected to be issued soon. Unfortunately, at this time, we cannot give you a definitive answer on whether or not 14-day quarantine will be required."
We see people violating quarantine all over the world. This is why most people I know are not anxious to open the country to travelers--no matter how badly we are suffering right now.
Tomorrow the premier is giving the guidelines for international travel
"#15 blamona, thanks for the heads up. Address is at 1400 EDST and people can listen http://www.rtc89fm.com/livestream.htm"
I checked out the Premier’s FB page earlier where she stated she will be giving a National update tomorrow. But there wasn’t anything said about announcing international travel info. Did she post somewhere else?

"I listened to the PM's speech, till shortly past where she said they'd have announcements on testing and entry requirements later this week (or Monday?)  If there is additional related info I missed, someone please post. :-) Thanks!Or if there was anything interesting from the Hotel and Tourist association. Was too late for that when I saw tewks's post. :-)Edited: 4:14 pm, June 15, 2020 "
"It was a little drawn out, spoke to friends on island who also gave up half way thru, maybe something will be posted if any changes where made.."
"Did not hear it but am told by people on Island there was no new info on entry or quarantine requirements which will be announced later. The Premiere covered recent murders, some finance related stuff and some ideas for changing the economy and crime rates by having trade schools. There was nothing in her announcement that was related to tourism or entry/visiting rules etc."
