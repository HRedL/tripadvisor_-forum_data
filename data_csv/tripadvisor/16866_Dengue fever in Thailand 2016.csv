"Hello,We are travelling to Thailand in 2016 December for a week. I have heard a lot about dengue been a problem this year more than previous years. We will be in Bangkok for 2 days, Krabi and Phuket for 3 days each.Can you please advise if December is still a high risk season for dengue in these areas? We are living in decent 4-5 star hotels in all these places. Do they take measures against this generally? We will also be visiting all the tourists places like temples and safari etc.Should we be good if we just use mosquito repellants and Vitamin B tablets? I have heard about covering up yourself as much as possible but not sure how does this work if we are going to be on the beaches and the weather will be warm to hot if I am not wrong.Sorry if that's a bit too much but am a bit anxious and worried about this."
"There's another very similar thread here:https:/…79051763Wear mozzie repellent day and night, wear lightweight cotton tops with long sleeves at night if you can, mozzies never seem to be a problem on the beaches in my experiences, it's only once you step away from the beaches into the greenery."
Dengue mosquitoes breed more in urban areas than wilderness areas but 4-5 star hotels can be expected to take mosquito controlled measures like regularly fogging.I've never heard of taking vitamin B so I looked it up. The CDC says it's ineffective:https:/…p0000443.asp
The problem with duplicate threads is that often both are deleted.
Thank you for your reply. Sorry about duplicate post. I will delete this now.
We just returned from a three-week visit to Thailand. On the second to last day my daughter began showing signs of Dengue. She turned out to have type 2 Dengue and needed a week-long stay in the hospital to recover.We think she was infected on Koh Tao. We used insect repellent but apparently not frequently enough.I'm glad she became symptomatic in Bangkok because the hospital was incredible. From what I now understand they're experiencing the worst outbreak in 20 years so take precautions.
Thanks for the update.
"@briguystu Worst outbreak in 20 years? So, are there any islands on Thailand that are Dengue free?"

"@ Vlada SDengue Fever is prevalent throughout South East Asia including Thailand as well as other regions worldwide. Wherever you go since there is no prevenative medication as Cassnu says in reply #1 ""Wear mozzie repellent day and night, wear lightweight cotton tops with long sleeves at night if you can, mozzies never seem to be a problem on the beaches in my experiences, it's only once you step away from the beaches into the greenery.""@DodgerIrishinLondonOnce again the link you have quoted ORIGINATED IN 2013 and is identical to ones previously quoted from the Samui Times which for reasons best known to itself just keeps reprinting the article, which in itself quotes information that did not and still does not correspond with other more official and authoritative sources, and changing the date to make it appear it is current.The ""news""paper seems intent on alarming visitors to Thailand in general, Koh Samui and Ko Tao in particular. Despicable!!!"

Most media don't repeat the same alarmist reports when they purport to support the island from which they earn a living especially when that media is sourced from an Aussie lawyer.
