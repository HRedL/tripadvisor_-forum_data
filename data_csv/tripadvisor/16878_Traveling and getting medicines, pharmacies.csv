"I slowly getting a list of what I might need. Anything can happen when I am abroad. I found a list of pharmacies online. I do not know how to read Ukraine and I think, think? when at a pharmacy, I type in a item to google translate eng to uk, the medicine will be sold in Ukraine.http://en.shram.kiev.ua/health/apteki.shtmlexample is when I was in south west asia, this villager had to walk 12 miles for aspirin. Imagine that , just aspirin. I gave the doc a bottle of Ibprofin I picked up before. Said here hand these out too. I was thanked by the chaplin. I have got to dot the i's, cross the t's. Be prepared when traveling, do not know anyone in that country. What alerted me is what happened in France to 2 brits. A muslim stabbed 2 brits in an alley way. Tell me where will they need medical attention? Be on the look out for the worst. Anything can happen now a days. I read some medicines in the US are not allowed in Ukraine, Europe. What do I then?"
"What on earth are you on about? That was a whole lot of rubbish. Pharmacies are all over the place. Look for green crosses and signs saying ""АПТЕКА"" (""apteka"", like ""apothecary"") . You'll find anything you need there.Edited: 1 year ago "
"I never been to Ukriane, don't know what your taking about."
"Then simply ask - no need for bringing in 3th world experiences on basic products such as aspirin (that by the way is a trademark for around 80 countries, not a product) or ibuprofen Your profile shows no information on where you are from - but with the exception of the part of Ukrainian territory occupied by russian backed and russian forces (Donetsk and Luhansk, Krim) most places including Kyiv are probably safer than comparable places in your own country. See also your country travel advices for Ukraine - for instance https:/…health - https:/…Ukraine.html (kind of excessively critical imho) - https://travel.gc.ca/destinations/ukraine There are plenty of pharmacies in Ukraine, many with extended service times. Most medication is easily accessible - several products that need a prescription in many western european countries are available over the counter, at most of time much lower prices. In case you need prescription pharmaceutics - take what you need for your vacation, in original packing (as far as possible) with a copy of your prescriptions (typed, not handwritten). In case you need more check with a pharmacy. Not all pharmacies in Ukraine have staff speaking english - but staff can read prescriptions if necessary and get you most probably the products (sold maybe under some other name)."
pharmacies are all over in ukraine. in big cities some work 24/7. all basic drugs are available over the counter. a short visit to a hospital would get you any prescription you want.
"I think the OP should use Google streetview for a bit to look at Kyiv. They might be surprised. Ukraine is not sod houses or huts with thatched roofs! :) For first aid, I can take everything I need when I travel in a pack about the size of a deck of cards. Some Anaprox, aspirin, a couple bandaids, some second skin and Immodium. Done that for all my decades of travel, including places that no one goes - Like Papua New Guinea."
"This is just getting more and more entertaining!Eddie, you can bring your meds with you. In case of regulated drugs, bring your prescription along and will be fine."
Be aware that most countries restrict narcotics and opioids (and marijuana/cannabinoids!) even with a prescription.
ok
"learn something new every day. I did not google enough before asking here. I found 24 hr pharmacies, now have to cross reference with map I had printed out at Staples. my hotel to closest pharmacy. Never a problem asking."
"Fantastic, Eddie! Keep up the good work and keep us posted about your new discoveries."
"got it, google street view . place looks like any modern 20th century developed city. Ok. asking never hurts. better to be prepared. Don't speak or read the lingo over there. depend on cell phone. Looking => chernobyl, the radiation disaster years ago. what? nuclear disaster? radiation spread to the world? what? Why go to that place? Why are there tours there ? Crazy? what uprising in 2014? 100's killed in streets? Why go there? Stay away from taxi gypsies. use uklon/uber got it."
eddie eSome of your questions are a little mystifying Are you quoting from what you have seen on google?.I don't know where you are from but if English is your first language then don't worry.Ukraine is not a 3rd world country where they will stop and stare at you. Though by Western standards it is considered a poorer country but in Kyiv it's modern and people do speak English.In my travelling there since 2003 I have found people very accommodating and generally very friendly.I started out by carrying a Russian/English dictionary learned a little of the Cyrillic alphabet and bluffed my way round!!! The real purpose of this forum is to help you and there are lots on here who will do so. Just ask simple questions and don't worry. Have you booked your trip yet?
"Ok. Yes, I booked and ""preparing; for what I need, want to do, where I want to stay, get the lay of the land. You say everyone knows english, but some websites same contrary. I never heard of a power pack before, never had a use for that device until now. Seems nobody gets it? You used a dictionary, and now a days there are electronic translators, smart glasses that translate other languages, still on the prototype level for me. I found itineraries online of where to go, so maybe I do not have to join a tour group ? I found there are boat tours, ok. you and others have been to Kiev lots of times, this is my 1st trip. so criticize my asking. Someone will have a answer or encountered what I want to know."
You're planning a trip to Ukraine but somehow have never heard of the Chornobyl disaster?!
"My job at the time, I was far away from any news. Now with time, I'm planning a trip.Edited: 1 year ago "
I genuinely love your post. It’s funny because Of just how many pharmacies there are in Kyiv. They’re so common there I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s one for every transport stop. I’ve seen several pharmacies next door a few doors from each other. There as so many that for a good few weeks when I only saw the “+” sign I thought they were churches. (Which is also funny to me because As of today I found out that almost half of the population are atheist). Felt even more silly when I had been wondering round looking for places to purchase medice and is been walking past them all that time. I do understand your concerns though. But rest assured medicines are highly accessible there! Bright green plus sign. Also I think it’s amazing that most are open either 24 hours or late into the night.Ukraine continues to impress me
"thanks, you have been there, I have Not been there, so I ask a simple question. So why the text abuse, attacks? because I'm taiski."
I found out the reason for so many medical supply shops HIV AND AIDS IN UKRAINE.https:/…ukraine Ukraine has the second-largest HIV epidemic in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.  The epidemic is closely associated with injecting drug use.
"That would not be the reason, but okay."
"Those comments confirm eddie is a troll, as though it wasn't obvious already."
"@eddie e: if you have travel related questions on Ukraine - ask. But please don't use TripAdvisor forum as a kind of blog for personal remarks and interpretations that make no sense, or are not travel related. Thanks."

"i am currently lookng for medications as i did not take my medical hstory or prescription history with me and lost my medication. I have now been searching for an apteka that will provide me with Alprazolam, Diazepam, and precocet (oxycodone).Some Apteka;s claim yo dont need a script for these meds and they just dont have them in stock, while others say you need a script, and even had some apteka's tell me that these drugs aren't even available in Ukraine.I am in Kiev if anybody has any suggestions that would be great, money isnt an issue."
"Good luck getting those without prescription. Unless you befriend some cute pharmacist :)Try getting a prescription from a real doctor. It should be possible, if money isn't an issue."
"Join https://www.iamat.org/ and they can refer you to an English speaking physician. I've used this service all over the world and it is impressive. And it is free for the first year. And when you get what you need, you better not try to take it out of the country without a prescription..."
Can I bring TB medicines to Ukraine?I'm traveling from india.is it necessary to declare that in coustms?
"Can you please tell me whether I can bring TB medicines to Ukraine?I'm traveling from india.if they allow ,should I declare that in coustms"
You can bring your tb medicines to Ukraine.
Should I tell the coustms about medicines
Don't volunteer anything unless you are asked and in my visits to Ukraine have never been asked about medicines.
"Good advice, taurean.Also good idea to have prescription for this medicine, in case they ask."
"TB ( and some other diseases) is endemic in Ukraine. If you have resistant TB, medication or not, be prepared for a grilling and possible entry refusal. Ditto if you are searched."
