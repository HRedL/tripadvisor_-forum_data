Heineken Mexico follows suit the same day.https://www.jornada.com.mx/ultimas/economia/…I've lost my will to live...
I expect we'll see a run on beer sales before the stores run out of what they have in stock in the next few days.
I'm running to Chedraui this morning. This is the first time I'll ever take a shopping cart home.
We're heading out to stock up as well. I'm sure we'll both have plenty of company.
"Considering the vast majority of Mexican beer sold here in the US is made in Mexico, it will have far reaching effects. That will be a huge revenue loss for the country. Watch the peso fall even more."
"@sunngod I think it says in the article. Yes, Constellation is mostly Mexico based breweries for US consumption, but they have a deep pipeline (not literal) with a month's supply. After that, it's anybody's guess. Meanwhile in Mexico we're getting ready to have arrests at midnight for going out to resupply with the illegal distributors when the caguamas are gone. Tough times ahead of us. I got my Victoria.Edited: 3:04 pm, April 03, 2020 "
Proof that Mexico does not have its priorities straight.
Nono not my Pacifico!
