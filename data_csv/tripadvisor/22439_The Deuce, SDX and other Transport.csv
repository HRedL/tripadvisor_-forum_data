"I’ll take a wild guess and say they won’t be packing the busses full anymore. Maybe run them at 50% capacity (or less). Same with the shuttles.

"Thanks, Hyper. Looks like once busses get near 50% capacity they’re sending more busses out."
The RTC SDX is currently not running. The Deuce is running 24/7. All other routes are currently running on a Sunday schedule. The Monorail is not running. This may change soon.Here is a photo I took on the Deuce 4/11/2020 https://i.postimg.cc/x8zYZz4J/DSC00106.jpg
