"Who is this mysterious “dictator”, AlfredJones?Perhaps you could explain your deep concerns clearly so that we visitors can look out for danger"
"Sounds like a fluff piece put out to protect Thai tourism. Better to see what something like WHO says: who knows, they may agree with his prognosis."

"The CDC or WHO would be the most up-to-date on the ""worldwide"" news. But, then again, many believe they have an agenda."
"Isn't much news worthy, just body counts. Plenty of info already about avoiding and managing symptoms. Same as any flu."

I have been playing with the idea of opening myself up to serious attack by saying that this seems to be a media driven storm in a teacup.OK. You can all attack me now.
"I'd stir the pot, if I didn't agree with you. Much to do about nothing, unless you live in China.Do consider who controls the MSM, along with who is biting at the bit, for those tax dollars to finance a vaccine.Oh crap, I'm getting signals, tracking me.....put the hat back on...whew."
"Well whatever is going on the fact remains that this is hurting, and it wont stop until this virus peaks and heads off down the other sideA vaccination is needed and in time things will return to normalUntil that happens those who are getting a good financial kicking will just have to tighten the old beltThailand is well in the firing line because they have put too many eggs in one basketI wonder if they will end up thinking its a storm in a teacup, oh to be unaffected and detached, best I dont mention those who have had to shuffle off this mortal coil of oursSis in law who works in KL in a Chinese Bank says silence is golden at work, most of the other managers are still locked down in China so theres a silver lining for ya 5555555Happy Travels"

"Cat fight, much more interesting than a virus."
Babysat Mom at the dentist last night. Interesting to hear that her dentist can't get more surgical masks because the supplier has run out.
tell that to the 6 new cases of the virus confirmed today
"Don't think the 50 people who died on the highway care much, or the 100 or so that got the normal flu, which is more of a threat.You buy mom a cuckoo clock yet, or at least some chocolates."
"No masks left where I live. Hand sanitiser out of stock... Lucky for me I have some spare 7/11 goodies I bought last trip. :)Can't wait to get on a plane where I shouldn't get hacked and sneezed over for once.Bangkok here I come :)Travelkat 100% spot on...Edited: 10:44 pm, February 04, 2020 "
"“You buy mom a cuckoo clock yet, or at least some chocolates”What should I buy my dentist and her staff?"
Funny how they announced days ago how the situation was 100% under control in Thailand and just yesterday there were four new cases in Thailand that were locally transmitted.
"Funny ???It's Thailand, and nobody is surprised............or worried. They also said it will get worse before it gets better.Contain to no deaths..........and you score 100 %"
