"We are travelling in 3 weeks from BC, Canada and are aware of the PLF form prior to travel. Today I read in the Greek Times the follow advisories which seems to indicate that we now have to provide a negative test for COVID, 72 hours prior to arrival. We don’t have a problem with this, however coming from BC our numbers in this province are very low and therefore we can’t be tested unless we have symptoms or concerns with being around others. Some might say pretend but this will go against us ......anyone just flown and received this information or can advise if this is the case given that I can’t find anything on the AC website or other site outlining this. I originally thought it was only applicable for certain countries at the land borders...confused?Protocol for air arrivals in GreeceArrival at the entry gate.Transfer to the area where the screening personnel are located. Travellers are requested to show their QR code either on their mobile phone screen or in print. If travel departure begins prior to the day of arrival, travellers are allowed to board after showing the confirmation email (and not necessarily the QR code which is scheduled to arrive during their trip.)Depending on their QR code/confirmation, travellers are directed either to the screening area where they will be tested for the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 by a trained health team or to the exit (to baggage claim area or passport control).Upon completion of the test, travellers are directed towards the exit (to baggage claim area or passport control).The test results are expected to become available within 24 hours. During that time, passengers who are tested are advised to practise social distancing according to local guidelines and self monitoring for symptoms that could indicate COVID-19. In case of such symptoms, medical advice and/or contact with the National Public Health Organization (EODY) Operations Centre should be immediately sought. Only in case they test positive, the authorities will contact them and proceed with the health protocol in place. Otherwise, they may continue with their holidays, adhering to the general public health safety guidelines.If travellers plan to have multiple stop-overs in Greece, they must declare this and report their initial destination and their travel itinerary for the next 7 days.As of Tuesday July 28th, 2020, passengers of flights from Bulgaria and Romania to Greece will be required to have a negative molecular test result (PCR) for COVID-19, performed up to 72 hours before their entry to Greece*. This does not apply to Greek citizens, permanent residents of Greece and travellers for essential professional reasons.Travellers should be laboratory tested with RT-PCR of oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab.Only travellers who carry a certificate of a negative RT-PCR test result will be allowed by the border authorities to enter the country. The certificates should be written in English and bear the name and passport/national ID number of the traveler.The Laboratories that perform the RT-PCR testing should be:National Reference laboratoriesNational Public Health Laboratories orPrivate laboratories which are accredited from the respective national accreditation authorities (not necessarily specifically for COVID-19).Certificates that do not fulfil the above criteria will not be accepted. Certificate forgery is punished by Greek Law.Travellers will still have to complete and submit their PLF form and may be subject to random testing upon arrival to the Greek border.*Specifically on Tuesday July 28th and Wednesday July 29th, travellers who did not have time to be tested before departure will be tested by Greek competent authorities upon arrival in Greece."
You say you are coming from Canada - what route are you taking? Those bests are for Bulgaria and Romania.... so are you flying via one of those?
"These rules where imposed over the weekend for travellers flying from Romania and Bulgaria due to a spike of positive cases in these countries. If you are worried that the negative test requirement may be imposed on flights from Canada in 3 weeks, then yes, it cannot be ruled out depending how the epidemiological situation develops in Canada."
