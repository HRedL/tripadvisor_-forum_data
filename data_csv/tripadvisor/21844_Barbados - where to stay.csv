Hi I am looking to book a hotel with all amenities close by a nice beach in Barbados in October . I am looking for something on the beach but also in walking distance of bars and restaurants (not so into clubbing these days) bit like a bit of life i.e lively bars etc .. Looking for an area wheres theres plenty to do and has a nice beach. Another question is the sea warm on all the coasts of Barbados or do I need to stick to the West Coast . So confused . Thank you in advance.
"The sea is always warm. I love the east coast but apart from a couple of places it's not for swimming although excellent for surfing. South coast is a mix of rough and quite calm. Main nightlife on the island is here too at St Lawrence gap. Here Dover beach is excellent. The west coast may suit you more, Holetown beach is excellent with the Surfside beach bar. There are also a few bars roundabout as well. Buses up n down the south and west coasts so could use it as your base. There's a couple of Holetown specialists likely to be on soon for good advice, cheers"
"I think the water is always warm but I often find that people coming from USA disagree and even look for heated pools? Barbados uses an environmental way of heating pools, depending on the sun!Both South or West will meet your criteria but budget will decide which resort to choose."
"When I travel to Barbados its normally in November and I find the sea pleasantly warm. West coast offers calmer seas (as already mentioned) but the trade-off is the beaches are smaller than the south coast.If you pick the west coast have a look at The Sandpiper, very close to Holetown centre but quite pricey.One word of caution regarding Holetown, there are quite a lot of major construction works due to be carried out, I am not certain of the schedule but some residents will be along to offer further information I'm sure."
Discovery bay still hasn;t got planning permission permit - once it gets it - due to close end of April 2020 for 2 yrs??Zaccios/Tropical Sunset hotel also awaiting planning permission and are due to close August? 2020 for 18mnth??
Would suggest Fairmont Royal Pavilion on beautiful Alleynes Beach - or Coral Reef Club by the National underwater marine park with its buoyed area to keep snorkelers safe frm water craft - close to Holetown with all it variety of restaurant and bar choices
"ASO, so the works are only weeks away, I thought they were way off. Hopefully, all the demolition can be finished in the not quite so busy months."
JGDY - who knows - planning permit for demolition and new build not yet issued AFAIK -- but as soon as..... yup
"I completed a survey issued b the Architects of the new Royalton Discovery Bay the other day and no , planning permission has not been given as yet .  Four stories is the plan and 251 rooms . I pointed out the beach is just not big enough for that amount of people , especially when the sea comes all the way up the beach !! We shall see .Edited: 7:35 pm, February 24, 2020 "

Does anyone in Holetown know if they started construction here (at Zaccios/Tropical Sunset) or if they're still planning to be closed basically through end of 2021?Thanks in advance."
"Tropical Sunset’s proposed re build was put on hold and they stated they would remain open until the end of March 21 .  That was BEFORE C 19 ! Whether they will choose to carry on with the re build next year after being closed for so long now remains to be seen .Why not contact them and ask the question ?Edited: 1:13 pm, June 05, 2020 "
"Visitors may find this helpful, I just received an E-mail from a hotel in the Dover area, as I have stayed there numerous times.In the E-mail they describe the measures they are taking to ensure the safety of their guests. One sentence caught my eye, ""all visitors must come with non-medical masks"". No more information provided as to when the masks must be worn. I E-mailed them back, and they indicate that any visitors coming to the island should be prepared to wear a mask while out in public, including, restaurants, beaches, the hotel pool, etc.That's all well and good, however, I doubt too many visitors will want to spend their hard earned money under these conditions.Edited: 2:55 pm, June 05, 2020 "
"No one on the beach is wearing masks at the moment , but they are in general , respecting social distancing .  Mel , if your hotel still keeps to those rules when you are due to arrive , would you be happy to compromise the health and safety of the Bajan People by ignoring the recommendations, or would you chose not to come ?"
"I think fair enough on public transport and maybe in shops, supermarkets etc where it is a confined space. But restaurants should be able to place tables socially distanced and you can't eat or drink in a mask so would be a totally ridiculous proposal. The beach and pool likewise. I am struggling with the idea of flying with a mask on for 8 hours let alone wearing one all holiday. I also worry about touching your face putting them on and off whilst out and about which you would do if it was necessary in a restaurant. I see people at our local supermarket doing just that and to me that poses far more risk of bringing germs near your face. Let's see, hopefully sense will prevail and it will just be for sensible usage; Airport, travel, transport and shops. The rest of the time it shouldn't be that hard to social distance. One thing I have been thinking about is how the catamaran guys will get on. That will be a more tricky conundrum."
"Denise, we have stayed on both the West and South coasts. We prefer to stay on the South coast in Worthing but do like to travel, either by bus or car, to the West Coast for the calmer seas. We find the South Coast has more affordable restaurants and it is easy walking to many of them. Also a room with a sea view is generally cheaper in the South.I certainly would not be going to Barbados if I had to wear a mask. Not a good suntan look when you get home!!"
"Verderose -------------------- surely you are not allowed in shops in Britain without a mask are you ? I think that particular rule will be here for some time, but the beach and restaurants will be managed by social distancing I would imagine.  Drinking in Bars is still banned-----------------not sure how they will manage that one, but I'm sure Mia will sort it out ."
"That will be a challenge Westie - as I have read that the louder one talks the more "" C19 particles"" one can spread -and in bars voices are usually raised - plus it's impossible to drink with a mask on - so?????"
"Westie, we don’t have to wear masks in shops in U.K., and most people don’t.I think from 15 June it will be compulsory on public transport, but it’s not at the moment.I think the jury is out as to whether they stop you catching the virus, but they seem to stop transmission if you’re a carrier.Have the schools gone back in Barbados ?Some primary schools started back here last week so let’s see how that goes .Small classes of up to 15."
"No, Maeve, schools have not yet gone back but they are doing soon ----------------the 15th rings a bell ? Many shops are not only making you wear a mask, but as they sanitise your hands and bags as you enter the shop, some of the bigger ones , also take your temperature . Jolly useful for self confirmation that you are healthy !"
"Canby- I think that’s what I said, they stop transmission of the virus if you’re a carrier, but they don’t stop you catching it.Sounds a good idea to wear them anyway in public places.Edited: 12:41 pm, June 06, 2020 "
"Re-taking your temperature,I’m sure it makes people feel re-assured,and certainly does no harm,but a fever is only one of the indicators that you have/are carrying and spreading the virus.I’ve seen numerous scientific studies that show 40 to 45% of the people shedding the virus are asymptomatic,so those people would not be showing any anomaly in temperature.Again,no harm,no foul-but not anything that will greatly reduce the possibility of spreading the virus,just weeding out those who show that particular symptom.."
"Whether what they are doing is seen as efficient or not , J Pete , the fact is we haven’t had a Positive case for 15 days clear now and whatever anyone says , that’s pretty good in my eyes .  The vast majority of cases have been found from Contact Tracing , I understand that the U.K. gave up doing that early on and are about to start again . Perhaps they should have carried on and maybe they would be better off now!Edited: 3:26 pm, June 06, 2020 "
"Maybe it’s something to do with the 67,000,000 population of the UK, as opposed to countries with less population than a UK city."
"Maybe it does Joan , but really the United Kingdom having the second highest death rate in the whole world next to the USA which is off the chart now , is hardly something to brag about , and if they thought they couldn’t carry on Contact Tracing at the beginning, why are they starting it again now .Edited: 4:51 pm, June 06, 2020 "
Belgium has the highest “death rate” in the world from covid. USA are around 9th. Also if countries such as Spain and Italy reported care home deaths they would be way above the UK.
"Orlando  The United Kingdom has had 284,868 cases of Covid 19 to date with , sadly ,40,465 deaths .  Belgium has had so far 59,972 cases with 9,580 deaths .  This will enable you to check daily http://corona.tuply.co.za/  I think your figures are a little outEdited: 5:44 pm, June 06, 2020 "
Westie you need to look at deaths per million of a country's population to get a true reflection https:/…Belgium does indeed have the worst death rate followed by the UK which is not good at all but if you look ours isn't dramatically different to quite a few other European countries.
"Oh , ok thanks for that UK ----------------------The figures are still not pretty whichever way you look at them though ."
"Hi DeniseS, St. Lawrence Gap, (The Gap) I would think fits all youre wishes, have a look at all the You tube vids, about "" the gap"" look at google earth pick out"" the gap"" go up and down the road and look at the different types of accomodation. Top end of the gap more bars, clubs, not much beach area, bottom end, Dover beach area, more accommodation, better beach areas, if you like a beach walk, Maxwell Beach is, bottom end, fabulous, check on you tube. Hope you can go October, im also booked for then, fingers crossed.PS nothing wrong with The West Coast, just the South Coast suits me.Edited: 12:56 pm, June 07, 2020 "
I think we need to remember that the chances of there being an infected person in the community is now VERY slim if not zero...... no new cases since 23rd May and the controls/ testing have been excellent The danger to the Bajan people will be letting in tourists ...especially from a country that still has new infections
"Back to the original post ....""On the beach"" is expensive .... be it the south or west coast ...but more so on the west coast Denise ... it would help a great deal if you could indicate some sort of nightly or weekly budget for accommodation ...and what do you mean by .."".with all amenities"""
"Whichever way you look at it the Covid numbers games is proving to be more and more difficult to assess ... with many countries reassessing the way they report figures So one has to ask ...where do these statistical websites acquire their numbers??/....then on what basis is each country reporting ...and has it changed????It seems that both the websites quoted are publishing the UK Government figures as reported at each daily bulletin. When pressed the Government will admit that are not an accurate reflection of the total deaths in the UKThere are very few if any countries in Europe that use the same reporting methods ...so it really is impossible to make valid comparisonsThe ONS report a different set of figures every Tuesday. Last week they had gave a figure (up to 22 May ) of over 49700 Covid related deaths To me it does not really matter whether we are No1 in Europe . No 2 in the world or No 6 in the world or outside the top 20 ... nearly 50000 deaths in the UK is simply horrific and almost beyond belief (77000 civilian deaths in WW2) It is well over double what the Government advisers thought would be a good result (around 20000)When will they apologise for all the additional deaths that their actions / lack of action have causedEdited: 2:02 pm, June 07, 2020 "
"Please note the original post is fromFebruary and before C 19 .  Dan brought it back up for some reason , I suspect that the OP Denise , is now waiting until Barbados reopens it’s doors before she decides where to stay ."
"I know the original post was from February, but 8 or 9 helpful replies out of 35 posts, up till now? really. Surprised the original post is still here."
"Hi Westigal3. Yes, I revived an old thread as I tried to do what is often suggested, being use the search tool. I was looking for info on status of possible construction at Tropical Sunset and this thread popped up as the newest related discussion. That is the ""reason"" I brought it back up.In response to your initial reply of advice to me, thank you and yes, the first thing I did was to contact Tropical Sunset directly via their website/email and through instant messenger on their FaceBook page. To date I have not received an answer from them. If and when I do, I will plan to share here.We are anxious to begin travelling again as are many whom reside at latitudes north of Barbados.Cheers"
You might message their adjoining restaurant Zaccios on facebook - they always respond to fb messages - and they may be more informed as to the status of Tropical Sunset (as they have the same owners)
Thanks for the suggestion. Will do ;-)
"Thats great Dan and thanks for wanting to visit Barbados , we need everyone to think like you when it’s possible . I suppose Tropical Sunset cannot give a definite answer until Barbados opens it borders for travellers and I really hope they rethink their ideas re the hotel at least for a while . It would be so sad if yet another hotel was turned into a concrete and glass “thing “ on our beautiful coastline . Good luck with your booking ."
"sharing From Zaccios:“Hello, at this time we have not got an official date of closure. Due to the Pandemic we have not received any official word from the government on when Hotels will be reopening. As soon as this info is available we will make it public. I will contact the hotel and have them contact you.”"
This is an honest and appropriate answer. I am surprised that some hotels may be taking reservations.
