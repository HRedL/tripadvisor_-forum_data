We all have to make our own decisions but personally speaking I have cancelled all my overseas travel for 2020 and do not intend to book any further travel until things become clearer such asWho knows when the FCO will change it's current travel guidanceWhat quarantine arrangements will be in place on arrival or on return to the UKWill affordable travel insurance be availableWhilst some countries are starting to lift lockdowns who knows about a second or even third spike of infections - isn't Brazil one of the latest covid hotspots
"My flights aren't until next year, that's a long time away in coronavirus terms and I booked them in January. The issue here is that they've apparently canned flights up to April 2021 because they can't afford to fly them as of now but won't confirm or deny it.Edited: 5:04 am, May 27, 2020 "
"I have no suggestions to help with your conundrum. You seem very determined to get to Brazil in January 2021, and only you can decide what financial and other risks you are willing to take to make sure that happens.None of us knows if this nasty virus will die out in most countries in the next month or so (and for clarity I mean cases and deaths dropping to levels that present a much reduced risk for the general public who have no underlying medical conditions). None of us knows if there will be so called second and third waves. None of us knows even if these lockdowns are why numbers are reducing, or whether far more caught the virus several months ago and were asymptomatic so the so called herd immunity is beginning to have an effect or whether the virus is weakening and less easy to catch. Or any other speculative thought. All I can say is that my views are somewhat aligned to Tom's, it seems. I don't expect any existing bookings for the rest of this year to happen and I'm not booking anything new for next year until I happen to know a bit or even a lot more about where I stand with FCO directives, travel insurance, quarantines and much more besides. Among the regions of the world I'm especially wary of include many southern hemisphere destinations where reported cases are low, plus Brazil because while some hotspots are likely to 'burn out' in a few months, I think it has other challenges, including economic ones. In regard to using Norwegian as your airline of choice. I know lots of regular travellers who have found them a wonderful airline to use because of their low costs and wide network. However, given how precarious their financial situation has been for several years, and at a time when things were 'good' worldwide, I would put them in my list of airlines to avoid right how. Also, when I do start booking travel again, I will be making sure everything I book is cancellable with a full refund, and I am mentally prepared to do that even if it's a more expensive way of booking things. In the end, none of us has a working crystal ball. My pessimistic view may be entirely wrong and misplaced and your optimistic one, with a determination to book travel may mean I miss the jump on great bargains, getting to travel to places that once were overburdened by tourists but are able to be enjoyed with peace and quiet.However, your should reread your last sentence. You said yourself this has been a stressful year for travel. The rest of the year may be even more stressful. You also said there was a cancel now button........In your shoes, I'd be pressing it now. You also said you need to book alternative flights now while prices are reasonable. You don't *need* to do anything of the sort of course unless you want to, and that's up to you and your level of confidence. SWT"
"I didnt post this for a coronavirus lecture, it's not about coronavirus,it's only about Norwegians finances and their reluctance to confirm that they cannot afford to fly the long haul flights at least until April 2021, this is about them not admitting that the flights don't exist. My partner and I have a number of flights booked pre coronavirus and do not need to justify ourselves to any preacher on here. We will travel as soon as we are allowed, that's our decision as two knackered keyworkers not sat around at home developing coronaphobia!This post was for info for fellow Norwegian passengers also wondering about the press articles so stop posting large patronising essays on coronavirus."
JoolsYou are free to post whatever you want but others are also equally free to post whatever they want in response as long as it complies with TA’s posting guidelines
"""there is a cancel booking button on my online thing so sadly I may have to go that route and rebook""Even if you decide to book with another airline it would not be prudent to cancel your flight with Norwegian as it will probably end up cancelled eventually, in which case you will be entitled to a full refund. The Norwegian line is that all routes (bar a few domestic routes in Norway) are dormant until Spring next year *unless* demand is such that it makes financial sense to resume operations earlier. However, it seems really hard to believe that demand for travel to Brazil over the next year will be such that the latter will happen. And they were already scaling back longhaul operations before corona virus since they were losing money on it. I realise it's difficult to predict what the situation will be like in 8 months but I would be very surprised if Norwegian are flying to Rio in January next year."
"I’m in a similar position to you, booked with Norwegian to fly to Orlando in October. I feel your frustration in not knowing - I’m the same as I want to rearrange my holiday for next year if possible. I called them last week and they said something similar, they couldn’t confirm if the flight was going ahead - it sounds like the operators have been asked to work around any questions regarding the press they are receiving at the moment.I think it’s highly likely my flight won’t go ahead but as someone has already said I will be holding off until they cancel my flight so I’m entitled to a refund. Fingers crossed!"
"There is no answer to this problem in my view. It is what it is. If the top brass are not willing to fly in January for whatever reason, then that is that. Might they change their minds? Yes, but who knows if they will and when they would do that. Even the top executives won't know at this point.Do I agree with what they are doing? No, but it's not my decision to take. As is the case in so many threads, I think that the best thing is just to wait and see. I understand the desire to make alternative arrangements for financial reasons, but my choice if I were in your shoes would be to plan on either going if the flights operate, or staying home if they don't.No lecture intended, that's just how I'd be looking at the situation."
"""I didn't post this for a coronavirus lecture.""""do not need to justify ourselves to any preacher on here.""""stop posting large patronising essays on coronavirus.""You will probably get more helpful replies with a less combative attitude.BTW, hello, please and thank you are allowed on TA!"
I wouldn't bother giving any replies at all.
"We had a flight in June to London booked in January. I knew in March it would be cancelled, but just waited for them to cancel. They cancelled about 2 weeks ago and I got a refund about 5 days after if that is any help."
"From what I’ve read Norwegian are not operating any long hauls until next spring but obviously keeping cash for flights that have been cancelled will actually allow them to stay in business while their short haul operations start up again.Due to the debt for equity swap they have just completed they are currently debt free which puts them in a good position relative to other airlines right now. If I had to guess, the first long haul routes will be Gatwick to New York and Orlando from the end of March 2021."
Changing airlines could just mean waiting for the other airline to cancel. Nobody is in a wonderful state right now. Routes will likely get reviewed. Those that are less profitable or have more competition could easily disappear.
Understand your concern about Norwegian. My sister and I had booked flight from Austin to London in June. I waited and waited on what to do. I read this tip though that seems to help a lot. Advice was to wait until the airlines cancel. Then ask for a refund. Until that time I just left my trip alone. Ive had three trips cancelled this spring. I did hear that Norwegian takes about 8 weeks to receive the refund. I had flown Norwegian to Norway last September and was very satisfied with the airline. I'm hoping they will be flying next year. Good Luck!
