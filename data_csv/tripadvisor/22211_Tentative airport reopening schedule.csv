Some good news!https:/…coronavirus-covid-19
Good stuff if it holds true!
Wow. I can't imagine Aruba residents would even want or allow people from the US to fly there in May. That astounds me.
Wow hopefully optimistic!! Have to agree with crystalBlue .though. I just don’t understand how the American air lines think they will be getting planes back in the air sooner then other countries that have fewer COVID cases ??????
"I have mixed feelings about this as I have a trip planned on AA in May. Seems too soon. Will anything else even be open? Namely hotel, restaurants, casinos!?"
My guess would be that they will only allow flights from areas with few Coronavirus cases. Like not NYC.
Yeah makes sense. I don’t think AA flies from NYC area to AUA
"<< “ My guess would be that they will only allow flights from areas with few Coronavirus cases.” >>Given the preponderance of connecting flights to most places in the Caribbean — including Aruba — this would be virtually impossible to control for.Edited: 10:06 am, April 19, 2020 "
"Its going to be interesting for sure. It excites me and makes me nervous at the same time. I had a feeling this may happen after reading how dire the financial system is in Aruba....I felt they would open up the doors by June 1st after reading article yesterday. I hope it all works out for everyone!Edited: 10:40 am, April 19, 2020 "
"""Wow. I can't imagine Aruba residents would even want or allow people from the US to fly there in May. That astounds me.""Aruba was broke before all this started and the Dutch aren't helping much since Aruba refuses to restructure their corrupt political structure. The only shot they have is for tourism to start back ASAP."
"I can see flights on AA starting May 4th. Delta on May 31st.  United on June 14th. This supports the AUA infographic provided by the OP, which was updated two days ago."
FYI- American Airlines does fly from JFK and LGA to Aruba but with a stop on the way
EWR as well
"Tayfor2011 - yeah, I get that. Just thinking of our 30k new cases of Covid-19 per day. Those are just the reported cases, there is little testing being done and I doubt this will go from 30k to 0 in a few days.  Just like the US, if a restart happens too soon, it's back to square one and everything closes down again."
exactly thats why I will wait for months for things to get back to normal there. I hoe they dont jack up their prices to make up for lost revenue
They just announced Aruba Airport Closed to May 31st.
"GoGiansfan, do you have a source for this? Thanks!"
"Yes Aruba Airport just tweeted it.  COVID-19 situation UPDATE - April 19, 2020In order to contain the spread of the pandemic outbreak of the COVID-19, as per April 19, 2020 the travel restriction as proclaimed by the Government of Aruba has been adapted further in which also the allowance for legal residents to travel back to Aruba, if and when, their return to Aruba is approved by the Department of Civil Aviation of Aruba, has now been extended up to May 31, 2020.NEWS FROM Queen Beatrix International Airport"
It certainly makes sense to extend it.
