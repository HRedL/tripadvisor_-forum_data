We are arriving in Cape Town later this month from USA. It appears reports of infected people remains low. What effect is coronovirus having on your tourism? Are there any cancellations or advisories within South Africa?
"Seven confirmed cases countrywide as of this afternoon; none in the Cape Town area.https://m.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/corona…No advisories that I know of, apart from the usual wash your hands etc.Edited: 1:32 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"We are also headed to Cape Town the end of this month. We are up in Canada, so things aren’t as messy as down in the US. But we aren’t even considering not going. We aren’t high risk. We will take precautions when flying (probably the riskiest part of our trip) and we view our trip as necessary now in order to do our part in fighting the panic that is spreading needlessly.Edited: 3:01 pm, March 09, 2020 "
We fly in 2 months. Unless there is a ban we are going!
"SA seems to be further behind (in a good way) vs much of the rest of the world. So far only a handful of cases (7), none anywhere near Cape Town, and most crucially all known cases are related to a single group that travelled back from Italy which makes containment easier and gives no evidence (yet) of infections from unknown sources - so called community transition.Also, SA is according to WHO one of the best prepared, if not the best prepared, country in Africa to deal with an outbreak in large part because it has good lab/testing facilities.In a month most places in the world might feel like scary places, or on the other hand currently badly affected countries might have got over their peaks, be seeing declines in new cases, and many people thinking “that was no where near as bad as some feared”.Who knows what the future might bring but right now in SA things seem pretty calm and under control to me.Edited: 2:57 am, March 10, 2020 "
SA does seem well placed at present and hoping to fly into Joburg for a 10 day safari next week - from Australia. My concern has always been does the few numbers reported reflect small number of testing or the true situation ? Time will tell
"Another question is, what will happen if there will be a corona outbreak in the various townships around throughout ountry. Will this be controllable?"
"**will happen if there will be a corona outbreak in the various townships around throughout ountry. Will this be controllable?**Doubtful, but who knows?Edited: 7:06 am, March 10, 2020 "
I am not a doctor but as far as I know the temperatures in South Africa are to high for an influenza virus.But someone else may know this better
"I've experienced summer flu before today. And we're heading towards winter when, trust me, there are always strains of flu doing the rounds"
Australia is still in summer here and the virus has had no trouble surviving and spreading. Most days over 30 degrees Celsius but some unseasonable rain
"#8, your assumption is incorrect."
There is no reports of corona virus in Cape Town.
"Please be cautious when traveling to Johannesburg. Cases of corona have been confirmed but only 6-8 people have the virus. All is well, they have contained the issue so you should be okay. But please be careful. Enjoy your tip to SA.Edited: 3:19 am, March 11, 2020 "
"The Western Cape had just confirmed its first Coronavirus case, although it was not clear where in the Western Cape the patient is."
Number of confirmed cases in South Africa now 13
"We are arriving this weekend.What's the screen process at the airport?The NICD website ( nicd.ac.za/latest-confirmed-cases-of-covid-1… ) reported today there are 13 cases in total, 6 new from last report. However, last report was March 8 and has only 3 cases. So there are 4 unaccounted. The 9 reported all appear to be imported. It's not clear about the missing 4.Where can I find more timely and accurate information?Thanks"
"Nothing is unaccounted for: the first seven people diagnosed were all in the group of nine that came back from Italy on the 1st; the six new cases all travelled home from somewhere in Europe. For up-to-date information consider doing what I do, ie, monitor the news https://m.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/breaki…"
"Same here, we flying two weeks, unless there is a ban we are going, someone advised us to take anti bac wipes and wipe your airline seat and table, then bag the wipe, it's just common sense really, and keep washing your hands :)"
"Is there screening conducted at the airport upon arrival right now? If so, what's the process and how long does it take? Thanks"
"At JNB airport, body heat sensors/ cameras were in use even before anyone knows about COVID-19. ""unless there is a ban we are going"" - will you do the other passengers and travellers and above all, the people in South Africa the courtesy and will get a virus test before your departure? Because, it is not what South Africa can do to you, it is about what you can do to South Africa!Edited: 10:32 am, March 11, 2020 "
"I don’t know what it’s like where you’re from, but in Canada, one cannot just “demand” a virus test. In Canada they are only testing people who show symptoms or who have had close contact with people who are confirmed to have the virus. We can’t “pay” for a test just because we want one. So no, I will not be getting tested before I leave for Cape Town in 2.5 weeks."
"Unfortunately, in the USA, people who have symptoms of any virus cannot get tested until very ill. There is a major shortage of testing kits available, along with shortages of masks, hand sanitizer, etc."
If there were body heat sensors at CPT when I arrived last December I just passed through without even being aware they were there. If they are anything like the sensors at Singapore Airport when I arrived there during the SARS outbreak you won’t be held up or stopped unless you are running a temperature.
"our trip is planned for early May. Still unsure what we are going to do. We fly into Joburg, then the next day go to vic falls, then to cape town then to a safari in the kruger area. I would be lying if I was not worried."
"There are pathology labs that are now doing testing for Covid for anyone that wants to get tested.The process is to go to a Gp,fill in the NICD paperwork and go to the lab and do the test.Results are available in 24 hrs.All testing is done by theNICD .Popular labs are Lancet and Ampath in all major cities in S.A."
So far all cases in SA are imported. I have not seen a single case of local transmission. Hope SA can keep it contained.
"People seems to miss the point; it is not about getting infected, it is about not to spread the infection! So, while risk of getting a virus while in SA is really low, how is about bringing the same from your home country? Getting infected while waiting in the line at the airport, on the plane?? Again, it should not be about ""me"", it should be about ""you""."
My flight leaves in Friday for JNB. We will be staying 2 night in JNB and moving onto Kruger and Cape Town. I have been looking forward to this trip for 2 years.We are still planning in going unless we are restricted from traveling. I'm going to take every precaution I can and enjoy myself.My husband's bigger concern is travel restrictions go into affect while we are gone and we are stuck somewhere. He said a lot can happen in 2 weeks. Qatar Airways said we can reschedule our flight but we must do it 3 days before our travel date. So we are out of that window.
"jiffer21225, we have the same concerns as your husband - that we will get stuck there (altho there are worse places to get stuck). We have four cats and a pet sitter and I’m not keen to pay an extra 2 weeks for a sitter if we are stuck in SA! But we are still going in 2 weeks...."
Its a tricky situation. Like some other posters my trip next week via Jburg to Botswana and Zambia for 8 days is a once in a lifetime holiday planned for 18 months and costing a lot. The latter is not a critical point of course. I appreciate locals may not want visitors to keep arriving even with screening. There is a health risk of course but also an economic risk in some areas if all travel were banned. The situation of course may well be taken out of hands. Like others I suspect I will get in ok next week but not sure about getting home 10 days after that. I do think Australia has acted a bit quicker than USA but then it only takes one case or small group of carriers to go undetected briefly and we are in a heap of bother
US just banned travel from Europe for 30 days. So getting to SA might be OK. Returning to US is not a sure thing any more
"I saw they banned EU travel. We really want to go on this trip and if we cancel we would be out $15,000. Our travel insurance doesn't cover the virus. We planned and saved for this trip for years.We are not sure what to do. We are suppose to leave in 2 days."
"Are you flying through Europe? US airlines will allow you cancel now and give you credit for the flight ticket. The rest though might not be recoverable.Edited: 10:36 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"A bit clarification according to news siteThose exemptions are far more extensive than the President made them out to be. They apply to all US legal permanent residents, citizens and some of their family members, according to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security."
"There is no chance for me to get a test before my departure since I have no sign of any sickness and was not in any contact of suspected cases.If I want to be a responsible traveler, is there way for me to get tested once I arrive in Cape Town? It mentioned above it needs a notes from GP. I will be there on Sat. How could I get a note? Where do I go to get tested?Thanks"
"@jiffer21225 post #32, now that the full wording is online you can see that US permanent residents will be allowed to travel back from Europe: https:/…But there may be a change in your flights, the DHS will require ""U.S. passengers that have been in the Schengen Area to travel through select airports where the U.S. Government has implemented enhanced screening procedures.”Source: https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/03/11/homeland…"
Luckily for us our flights to not go to the EU. We have a layovers in Qatar.
"One case now reported in MPUMALANGAMPUMALANGA: 1A 27 year old female from Mpumalanga who had traveled to the United States. She returned to South Africa on the 7th March 2020 .Among today's case, there is one local transmission.FREE STATE: 1A 32 year old male who came into contact with a Chinese businessman.

Can anyone going in the several weeks post situation reports here about what it’s like in SA? While you’re there and maybe when you get back? What was it like Travelling? What’s the general vibe like? Is anything closing etc etc? I’d really appreciate it and I promise to do the same.
"I’m traveling to cape town tomorrow, I’ll keep you updated"
I’m in the Western Cape now. Arrived Wednesday.In entering Cape Town I had to have my temperature taken and was asked if I had been in Italy or Asia recently At the moment seems much more calm than I was experiencing at home but only time will tell. Just keep washing your hands very frequently
"Yes, our trip is also in May. South Africa- Namibia- Vic Falls (Zimbabwe). Flight, tours and accommodation have been paid for & out travel insurance does not cover us. Fingers crossed we can still travel - I have been planning this trip for awhile and am so looking forward to travelling there."
this is nearly exact trip we have planned also in early May. Everything paid for too lol. 12 grand invested so far .
"From a practical point of view (and I can only comment on Hermanus as that is where I live), we haven't experienced the panic buying that I have seen online in other countries.Plenty of toilet paper. Hand sanitizer is a little sparse, but other than that no difference in the shops.I haven't heard of any major events being cancelled. One thing that was on the radio is that the football players won't do that handshake at the beginning.A few schools are closed here and there, but very few.People here are calm but cautious. Lots of handwashing.I don't watch the news particularly. What I have seen suggests that the cases we do have were quickly isolated and the people they were in contact with found.Our municipality in the Overstrand have been very proactive on social media with giving lots of information about how to protect yourself, what to do and where to go if you start to feel sick.There are private tests available as well through doctors.Community groups are working to educate our poorer community particularly about handwashing and sypmtoms and we have an excellent community clinic here available for them that is free.Towns a bit quiet, but this isn't a busy time of year really and the weathers been a bit meh the last few days.Personally everyone I know has educated their domestic staff, gardeners etc. Provided sanitiser and they know if they get sick with symptoms they must go to the clinic and get checked out. Zwelihle they all live in very close proximity so it's important they have the info to avoid anything if it should reach here.What is happening in other municipalities I don't know.All my group of friends have stocked up incase we had to quarantine, and also put together a basic pack for our staff as well so they can stay in and also try and avoid contact should there be a worse case scenario."
"I really have no worries with the destination Gemma, its the travelling I am worried about. Just come out that a Virgin crew member has been dignosed, we have six flights on our June trip..."
"Hi Sandmans.I absolutely understand where your worry is.I had a trip planned for scuba diving in Hawaii end of April.As you know getting anywhere from SA when you earn in ZAR is madly expensive.The only way it was affordable was CPT - Amsterdam- LAX - Kona.So also 6 flights to get there and back. 4 of them very long ones.I had already decided to cancel before Trump forced my hand by banning travel from Europe.My reasoning is that although I am fit and healthy the virus doesn't always show itself. We have very few cases here, but the possibility of picking it up somewhere along the route, then transporting back to here was simply not something I could in clear conscience do.Of course we want people to still come to South Africa, tourism is a massive part of our economy, especially in the Western Cape where I live.I know what I am writing now will be unpopular with many here, but know I am just writing my personal opinion.Also know that my entire income comes solely from incoming international travel for safaris.All our cases here, now 16. The 17th was an error and was found negative, have come from overseas.In the large cities and good municipalities there is excellent planning.However if this virus was to enter into our poorer population, especially in more rural areas, it doesn't take a genius to see how that could quickly become a very big problem that would overwhelm the healthcare system. We simply have a large amount of people with compromised immune systems from HIV, TB, my domestic has lupus which is more common than you think here.My worry isn't so much that tourists come here and get sick.They are a lower risk, staying in clean places with good hygiene and sanitation and access to quick healthcare. My worry is that more people not displaying symptoms 'carriers'come over.Maybe do a fabulous township tour etc.In my opinion the likelihood of you getting sick here isn't high, and you would receive excellent medical care.It is the potential that you may be leaving behind something we will struggle to deal with.That's not a popular view with tour operators right now. Nobody wants to put people off coming, as it is going to be brutal for us!I know airlines are offering free flight changes.As I don't have new dates yet KLM a d Delta gave me a voucher to the cost I paid, no fee or deduction, that can be used anywhere in the world.I don't knowq about RSA as I don't do tours here, but Namibia lodges are also offering free changes of dates, so hopefully in RSA they have the foresight to do that as well....then we just will have to ride it out.That is just my own personal and not very popular opinion.... what you choose to do is at the end if the day your decision.You will notice very little difference here if you come. There isn't the panic buying and tv horror there is overseas.We are having stage 4 loadshedding alk week... 3 times daily powercuts.Why have one drama when you can have 2, but as we are a resiliant bunch the generators are out, the solar lights and inverters working....so even that you would barely notice.Whatever you decide I am sure you will do it responsibly, and if you do come you will definitely be more than very welcome!Edited: 8:55 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"Discover_Namibia, sadly, so far, the two Safari lodges we’ve booked and paid for (over $6000 Canadian) have yet to release any cancellation policies relating to Covid. Ditto for some of the other accommodations we’ve paid for (specifically in CT and George). My travel insurance won’t kick in unless the Canadian government issues a warning against all travel - and they haven’t even done that for any country in Europe outside of Italy. It’s a crappy situation either way you look at it."
"Seriously!I am saddened to hear that the lodges here are not making the responsible response.Like I said, my voice is not a popular one on this topic in the industry. Too many people either have their head in tbe sand or eye on their bank balance, and this isn't a time for that.Canada to South Africa is far flying. It's a genuine concern your lodges should consider. Have you contacted them directly?"
I spoke to my TA today about trying to move our lodges stay until later this year. She said she will contact them tomorrow and let me know. She will try her best to change it but the lodges might not agree.I really hope she can because my husbands work has put a restriction on him traveling. We are suppose to fly tomorrow night. We are flying on Qatar and I dont think we will get any money back because they are requiring us to notify them 3 days before travel. We just found out today. Once I get an answer from my TA I will try calling Qatar Airways tomorrow.
"Have you tried contacting the airline directly.On their Coronavirus info page there is no mention of 3 days. Worth a try!I know with Qatar usually you need to give 3 days notice, but I think they may be making an exception. Has to be worth a call at least. https:/…COVID-19-update.htmlAnd honestly if your lodges are not flexible or even slightly full of xxxx not offering any kind of rebooking, rescheduling at no extra cost I would love to know who they are.That is exactly where I will NOT be sending my guests.Honestly the more I am hearing on here tonight, the more our of touch it seems the SA tourism industry is :-(Edited: 9:55 pm, March 12, 2020 "
Hopefully the lodges will let us move the dates. They are middle to higher end lodges. I will keep you updated on this crazy journey.
Thank you. Please do!
I see Australia has cancelled the Women’s Cricket Tour of South Africa due to start next week. Probably a sensible decision given possible cancellation of “crowd events” .in the near future . Sport here in Australia is mostly being played with no crowds at preset. F1 GP cancelled
G Adventure by National Geographic cancelled all their tours from March 16-April 30. My husband and I were nervously looking forward to arriving in Cape Town from the United States on March 20 for a 3 week tour of South Africa and Namibia. We’re disappointed but we feel G Adventure finally made the right decision for the sake of their customers and for the citizens of countries visited. We look forward to rescheduling this much anticipated trip when the pandemic ends. Thanks all for helping me plan the past 6 months.
"Cape Town has just cancelled its international jazz festival due to be held at the end of this month so stuff in-country is getting cancelled now.On the ground here though things still feel very calm to me, it’s more a case of the authorities trying to get ahead of the situation rather than things being even remotely like what I’m seeing from Italy or even the U.K. - I haven’t seen a single person on the street in CT wearing a mask for instance.SA is currently at 24 confirmed cases across the whole country (https://ewn.co.za/2020/03/13/confirmed-coron…) but that might be out of date within hours of my posting this."
And number of cases is heavily related to number of tests.
"I have several trips for several groups planned for May i South Africa and Botswana. On Friday, I called the various lodges to discuss options. I won't get into specifics, but will say that I was happy with the discussions. The lodges are aware and are trying to be flexible to shifts within 2020 on dates they have space. Not surprising, they are more reluctant to actually give cash back or to commit to allowing bookings being shifted into the 2021 season. I am waiting to hear back from fellow travelers, but I can tell the main fear isn't the bush, but the airports and long airplane exposure.Edited: 7:43 am, March 14, 2020 "
"Those businesses that will show their flexibility today will reap benefits tomorrow! However, also tour organisers should do the right thing ... to stop the trips until the situation gets better. Specially when organising trips from countries with higher risk level of exposure to coronavirus.Edited: 10:46 am, March 14, 2020 "
It was a tough decision but I am rebooking my vacation for the fall. Hopefully everything will be settled by that time. Qatar airways is charging me a $210 change fee per ticket. My 1 private lodge was great and said I can rebook it and I wont lose anything. The other lodge (which was more expensive) is charging me a 30% rebooking fee. It's a good chunk of change for that fee. I was hoping the fee would have been smaller. My hotel in Cape Tiwnwillallow me to rebook for the fall. They have been great to work with.I havent been happy with my travelers insurance. I paid $800 for the policy for this 1 trip and I can recoup any of my money lost. I had cancel for any reason policy. Why do I bother having the insurance? They said the virus isn't covered.
"jiffer21225, I thought 'cancel for any reason' was suppose to be just that. I have heard lesser coverages will not give much coverage except to cover you if you get the virus in country or if country closes it's borders. Also, it seems coverage varies depending on if purchased before this was declared a pandemic (and of course if you bought coverage close to when you paid for trip)."
I agree it should be covered. I bought the policy a year ago. They said the coronavirus isnt covered at all under any circumstance. Its not a fly by night company either. It's a large well know company that usually gets good reviews.
The problem with my insurance which is also a good company is once pandemic declared you are screwed. You read the conditions and all good until that last line - “note there is a general exclusion for all pandemics “
"I am planning on going to South Africa and Botswana in May. As of today, I see no reason to cancel my trip. The only reason that I could have is that the government announces a quarantine on all visitors to South Africa."
"As more and more European countries (this is where the majority of the tourists come from) are closing their borders resp. cancelling all flights, the more it will have a negative effect on the South African Tourist industry. Nobody knows how long this will last but I suppose that these restriction will be in place for quite some time."
Yep we have pulled plug. Once Aust Govt imposed a 14 day self exile on return it was a no brainer . Same could happen in SA . Things are moving very fast and in the wrong direction
we are also about to postpone. Probably re book everything for October .
"just saw the live press. conference from South Africa there is a ban on people coming among others from Italy Spain, United Kingdom, Iran and United States and for people having travelled there in the last three weeks"
Do you know how long the initial ban is for? Tried to watch the press conference but missed the important bits.
"https://m.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/corona… .The president's address starts at 19:38. I don't think he said how long the travel restrictions would be in effect. They said there's another press conference tomorrow morning with a number of cabinet ministers, where the details will be clarified.Edited: 2:16 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"I've just noticed I was the first to reply on this thread, six days ago. Seven confirmed cases, all from the same group of travellers, with one exception limited to KZN, no advisories or real restrictions ... And now look where we are. The only assurance seems to be it will get worse. Although I applaud my government's reaction to the crisis."
Why announce a ban and not provide any actual details?I known people travelling both ways in the coming weeks who are now confused.
"agreed, if you dont provide any details its just as good as saying ""we are considering a travel ban"". Hope to get more details soon."
"Tomorrow morning people, tomorrow morning. His message was primarily for us, his fellow- citizens.Edited: 3:29 pm, March 15, 2020 "

"this is exactly the text of his announcement so al said on the live conference. It was pretty clear to me...all people originating from or traveling through the high risk countries will be denied access,"
"“ all people originating from or traveling through the high risk countries will be denied access,”Well excluding SA citizens and perhaps permanent residents. This may be made clearer tomorrow."

"Apologies if I’ve missed the answer; we’re in a bit of a panic.My wife and I are in South Africa right now - on our second day in Kruger following one day in Johannesburg - and we’re UK nationals. We left the UK on Friday.We’re due to fly to Cape Town on Wednesday which is an internal flight, but will we be refused entry?We’ve reached-out to our airline and booking provider, but while we’re waiting, I thought it worthwhile asking here.Thanks in advance."
I have to say that I'm really getting worried that I won't be able to on my safari to South Africa and Botswana on April the first. I'm also putting an additional safari in South Africa on hold.
"#79, you're refused entry at a port of entry, not internally. Re travelling internally as a foreign national, I suggest going to one of the news sites, eg, www.news24.com , and read the full text of President Ramsphosa's address last night as well as the ministerial briefing this morning and see if it was mentioned.Edited: 6:33 am, March 16, 2020 "
"#80, we were booked for a trip to South Africa from India on the 1st of April, which is not a high risk country, not even a medium one. As of now we have counted it out of question."
"It's impossible to say how quickly the problem will be resolved in SA - we may get to the levels of infection seen in Italy and Spain, or the measures put in place by the SA government may ""nip the problem in the bud"", so to speak. All anybody can do is watch the news, wait and see what happens"
"Hi we're from Edinburgh & only a week into our 3 week trip. We've had offer of voucher from ba should we wish to cancel the first leg of our flight home but that's pe to jb. As for klm who we fly home with, don't answer calls, keep you on hold then it cuts off, no answer to what's app."
"poster 84have you looked at their website, seems that you might be able to make changes online . klm.com/travel/…index.htm"
FYI BA have just announced that they will be cancelling 75% of all flights worldwide in April & May. Virgin are cancelling 80% of flights and going to a skeleton fleet of only 6 planes with all others grounded! I’m in SA at the moment and somewhat worried about how I’ll get home in May if this gets much worse.South Africa is a beautiful country and right now the Covid-19 cases are relatively few and the government seems to be reacting quite intelligently and aggressively but personally I wouldn’t initiate a holiday pretty much anywhere at the moment due to concerns with getting home now that so many airlines are cancelling so many flights.I suspect that some will accuse me of fuelling a self-fulfilling prophecy but that’s my honest opinion - nothing particularly scary about SA right now but the decline in international flights does seem quite off putting.
"yay! we were suppose to fly BA, oh well i knew this was coming anyways, we are already looking at dates in 2021"
Did you work out what to do about your internal flight to cape town? I am from the UK and also due to fly on weds but unsure whether we will get kicked out or quarantined
Are you sure that your flight is still on? www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/south-africaDon't forget that your travel insurance will most likely be void.
"I fully understand the desire to travel as planned (not least of which because of the financial implication of not travelling as scheduled), but I have to question the wisdom of carrying on as usual in the circumstances of the Covid19 outbreak. Not only do you increase your own risk of infection, but you also increase other people's risk if you unwittingly travel while infected. One has to wonder when doing a risk/benefit analysis whether it is wise to continue with leisure travel."
"Yes, sounds simple - not! With help from uk we're now going home this weekend! Sorry to say that as sad to leave!"
“With help from uk we’re now going home”Could you give a bit more detail please sl840t? I am due to fly back to the U.K. on 2nd May and with various airlines virtually grounding their fleets I’m beginning to get worried about how I will get home.
"We've cut holiday short as family at home were stressing over us. We were also worried the longer we stay, the more difficult it might become. Also, we had to weigh up how much we were able to relax here in sa. Basically, my daughter spend a whole day trying to get through on the phone. She left public message on their fb page as she was so stressed. Don't know the details of call once she eventually got thru but we got our flights brought forward to this weekend."
"I am scheduled to visit South Africa at the beginning of May, but I probably won't get to go due to the Corona Virus. I have an American passport and holders of American passports have been banned."
"We are from the UK and due to fly home 27thMarch with Ethiopian Airlines. Cannot find much helpful info on their website , tried ringing but the line was so bad couldn't hear a thing !!Just wondering if anyone else out there is due to fly back to the UK with Ethiopian ?"
Apparently Ethiopian Airlines is still allowing international flights to continue. This is truly shameful.
"Thanks sl840t. I realise now that I might have misunderstood your first post slightly. When you said “help from u.k.” I thought you meant help from u.k. embassy/consulate in South Africa. I now realise that you meant u.k. family. Glad it worked out for you though.I might have an interesting time trying to get home on 2nd May if more airlines go the way of BA, Virgin etc and cancel most of their flights but I’ll deal with that problem if/when it arises."
"Hi, I have an italian passport but I live and work in Ethiopia. I have also an ethiopian temporary residence permit (ID Card). I booked a flight with Ethiopian Airlines from Addis ABaba to Cape Town. Do you think I will have the access denied? I was in Italy in December and I came back to Ethiopia in January the 5th. Since then I did not visited any other country. What do you think about it?"
"It is irrelevant what me or others think. It is what immigration officer will think. My prediction is that as soon as she/he will noticed your passport you will be escorted to an isolated room. Chances of entering South Africa, again only a prediction, are slim to none."
"I tried to contact the immigration office. Nobody answered the phone and then I sent an email, waiting for a reply. But I think you can check on the passport, through other visas, which country I visited beforehand. Hopefully, by the way, if it is a matter of nationality and not a matter where do you live or come from, is a little bit discriminating"
Let's wait. If I get any informaion that can be useful also for others I will share it. Thanks for your answer!
"Hi,although I can understand the individual problems of the posters, my recomendation, don't travel to South Africa for the time being, simply look what is happening in Italy today it's a human tragedy. Things Ramaphosa announced sound like a good plan, but beware if there is a corona outbreak in the townships, Lord help us, this will be uncontrollable.Already now, because of flight restriction and cancellations you have a great problem to return to your home countries, this will definitely not improve within the next months.Our goverment here in Germany has just announced a world wide ban on tourist travels for german citizens and the EU denies entry for anybody who does not live in one of the EU countries.Please understand that this not minor thing, but one of the most serious pandemics the world has ever seen. It starts small and people tend to not take it serious , so...please ..don't go resp. return to your home countries as quickly as possible."
"Hi,Just need some advice, I was due to arrive in Cape Town on 29th March from UK via Emirates and Dubal.I have spoken to them and they have said I cannot cancel without any fees at this stage as no flights have officially been cancelled yet by Emirates. whether this is because I am transiting through Dubai I am unsure I have looked on their website and it gives a link to the official travel advisoryhttps:/… And I have noticed that South Africa is no on here yet. can anybody help/advise."
"Sorry, not really sure what you are asking."
"Sorry for not being clearer.I just wanted to reconfirm that UK residents are 100% not allowed into South Africa, the Uk government advice is against all but essential travel but entries are accepted with a visa. https:/…south-africaWith the situation as it is I am definitely not going but concerned I am going to lose money on my flights without an official ban. I had also booked at Sanbona wildlife reserve and have emailed them if it can be postponed for 12 months but not yet had a response"
"Yes, UK residents are now not allowed to enter SA. Entries are also not necessarily accepted even with a visa. In the same announcement the SA president not only announced the ban on visitors entering from certain countries (UK, USA, Italy, Germany, etc, etc) but also announced that visas already issued would be revoked. They have since clarified that if the visa has already been used to get into SA so the visa holder is already in the country then those visas will not be revoked so people aren’t getting kicked out but getting in just got a whole lot more difficult.I’m guessing that the visa bit (future requirement to apply for a visa) is a mechanism so that embassy staff and other special case people can still get from the U.K. to SA but if the average U.K. holiday maker were to apply for an SA visa right now I suspect they would have zero chance of getting one.Edited: 1:04 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"What is not clear to me is whether is also a matter of nationality/ citizienship or only residence. I mean, if I hold an italian passport but I have a residence permit in another country (because I live and work there), may I enter South Africa? Or just because I have a passport issued by one of the high risk countries my entry will be denied?"
"I stand to be corrected, but as I understand it, it has nothing to do with nationality/citizenship but rather to do with where you are travelling from. Eg: It would make absolutely no logical sense for a ban to be applied to a Chinese / Italian / US / UK citizen who has been living in and is travelling from a non-affected State, while allowing citzens from a non-affected State (few as they are!) whonhas been living in and travelling from an affected State to enter the country. But,as I say, I may be wrong in my understanding of the SA travel bans (and given what I know about rationality in government planning, I could be very wrong...)"
"Yes, that’s my understanding too, it’s the country of origin of the incoming passenger that matters not the nationality of the traveller unless that traveller in South African (or maybe has permanent residency in SA, I’m not sure about that one) in which case SA citizens can get home from overseas trips. My use of the term “resident” was wrong - I had subconsciously extrapolated that to the inbound flight having originated from the resident’s home country which although probably true for the majority isn’t true for all.I’m starting proceedings this week to return to the U.K. early. I don’t want to get stuck in SA in 6 weeks time if things get worse. The final straw was seeing in the SA news this morning that the nursing union here is threatening to go on strike and withdraw their staff from hospitals!Stevenley - The Foreign and Commonwealth office has now officially moved SA to “The FCO advise against all but essential travel to the whole country” (https:/…south-africa) so check your travel insurance. Some insurance companies are setting deadlines after which it is considered that you booked and took out insurance at a time when Covid-19 was a known issue likely to get worse and are refusing Covid-19-related payouts for insurance taken out or flights booked after that deadline but if you booked before the deadline then, now that your travel involves a destination that the U.K. government is telling its citizens not to travel to, you should get compensation for cancelling your trip from them assuming you have a decent travel insurance policy. My insurance policy certainly covers that situation.Edited: 4:46 am, March 18, 2020 "
"Noted and thanks for the updates, I have since spoken to Emirates and they have said they will offer a full refund due to the official stance.Will just have to look to delay my trip for 12 months were hopefully everything will be back to normal."
"Currently in Kruger supposed to fly home to UK at weekend. BA flight not yet cancelled. Has anybody who is currently currently in SA from an ‘at risk country’ since mid-Feb etc., tried to get tested to comply with ‘should present yourself for testing’ requirement?"
"This is the official Emirates Policy , on their websites, as of today:REFUNDS AND REBOOKING POLICY FOR CUSTOMERS PROHIBITEDFROM TRAVEL DUE TO TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS:Ticketed to travel until 31stMayRebook permitted until 30thJuneReroute permitted until 30thJun to selected Emirates destinations only. Applicable fare difference if any would apply.Travel Vouchers for ticketed value.Refund of unutilised tickets"
"Hi,I was just wondering the same with regards to testing of travellers from high risk countries but can't find any info on where to get tested. The President's statement just says 'will be required to present themselves'... but where? And will this be enforced? who pays for the test?Any Input appreciatedEdited: 7:33 am, March 19, 2020 "
Re testing: https:/…repliesI know what the president said but I strongly suspect it's not being enforced.
"I see the advisory issued on Tuesday still says ""present themselves for testing"", Which is completely unrealistic imo. You could try calling the DIRCO number given at the end of https:/…"
"With present shortage of tests worldwide, this measure is probably not executable. What travellers, specially those coming from high risk countries should do is to self-isolate themselves from contacts with local population."
@Brixton2345. How did your internal flight go? We are also taking a flight from Port Elizabeth on Saturday to get us on a flight home from Joberg on Sunday.
"Thanks for your views on testing of travellers from high risk countries. I think social distancing is the best idea.@wavecatcher2006: good look with you flights! It would be fantastic if you could post how it went afterwards, especially if you had any trouble with boarder control with regards to the testing!Thank you all and save travels!"
"Hi, I left Cape Town on Thursday (19th) evening, flying BA to Heathrow - no issues leaving and no one asked about testing. We weren’t supposed to leave until 30th with Lufthansa from JNB, but we felt it was sensible to leave earlier and switched flights.Edited: 3:24 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"Hi, it was fine. There were no checks at all"
I just read an article which states you can only fly back to your own country after being in sa for 14 days. Anyone heard anything about this? I cant find it mentioned in any official adviceThanks
"Is this the article that you’re talking about? ...https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/west…... which quotes some Turkish journalist tweeting from Cape Town airport ...""Problem is (that) many travellers are only now finding out they can't leave, because of new Covid-19 rules which prohibit anyone who has been in SA for less than 14 days from departing. And it's heartbreaking to see the sheer desperation of people just wanting to get home,""I haven’t heard or read anything about this 14 day rule in order to be allowed to leave. It’s complete nonsense isn’t it? Plus I’ve seen a few people posting updates here today that Cape Town airport was quiet and calm when they flew out.What on earth is going on?"
Just a general question for anybody willing to make a guess. When will travel again be allowed to resume to from SA. July? October? Early next year?
"Hi, many thanks for sharing your experiences when leaving south africa, this helps a lot.I haven't read anything about that 14 days rule either..."
"#123: what is your guess? Because, really, it's as good as any of ours."
"Yes it is that article, sorry should have posted it. Given I cant find any mention of it else where I am hoping its not correct"
"I’m also hoping it’s not correct. It seems to make no sense if it is true. SA has locked down its incoming borders but how on earth can it help its Covid-19 response to prevent foreigners from leaving the country where, if they remain, they potentially add to the strain on the health system if they become ill?IF this is false information then that journalist who posted that nonsense has a lot to answer for and the news site (IOL) who simply posted potentially panic-inducing information without fact checking it first has even more to answer for."
"the restraint is due to the high amount of TB and Hiv in the city and lack of sanitary conditions and be lack of meds to tackle each condition going forward in the townships and beyond making all highly vulnerable leaving SA and entering other countries That is from the news i have read, so if your in the top five star hotel and the maid is from a township so much risk attached - it is really sad and time will tell."
"What complete & utter nonsense showing a profound misunderstanding of both South Africa and the transmission characteristics of those conditions.Firstly, high incidence of both HIV and TB have been issues in SA for literally decades so how come suddenly high incidents of those conditions that have existed for about three decades suddenly causes a 14 day leaving restriction in this last week. Also, re the expression or rather non-expression of symptoms, a 14 day rule makes no sense whatsoever.Next, HIV is not transmitted by basic contact (no bodily fluids) and TB needs prolonged exposure so that fear mongering about maids is ridiculous.Finally, many of us here have been travelling in and out of SA with no such restrictions over the past many years and the incidences of HIV and TB haven’t really shifted that much (well, the incidence of drug-resistant TB has increased but that doesn’t redeem the nonsense just posted for all the other reasons just mentioned)."
"The restriction of leaving the country might have been addresses to South African citizens, and I can understand why; they would eventually come back home, and much of the outer world is now having a higher amount of COVID-19 cases to SA.It surely is not addresses to foreigners in the country right now. How will they exit the country is another question.That is only my opinion, which might not be what is the official law.Edited: 2:34 am, March 22, 2020 "
"Lovedogs1234, this is not the first time you've spouted absolutely offensive garbage on this forum. Your post displays a level of ignorance not seen on this forum since the last time you were here throwing around accusations of fraud at another forum contributor. There are some very clear facts out there - please go away and acquaint yourself with them."
"Anyone travelling in the last few days out from Cape Town Airport/SA, have you had any problems leaving the country towards Europe (hence the article)?"
I’m due to catch the Emirates flight departing CPT 13:25 tomorrow. As long as I have time to sit down and get a WiFi connection and post something I’ll update tomorrow on how CPT looked for international departures before I board. I’ll be flying to Dubai (obviously) then on to LHR.
How are you planning to protect yourself on the flight?I’m flying to Johannesburg tomorrow and although only two hours I feel I would rather be overprotected.
"You can not protect yourself. Thus is why going into the quarantine is mandatory, being by the law or self-imposed."
"I’m flying from Cape Town to Johannesburg so will not be going into quarantine. Was just wanting to know if people are wearing masks etc on flights.I realise one can do everything possible and still get the virus but do want to be sensible as well as caring to others.Edited: 4:07 am, March 23, 2020 "
Post #12899% of this post is BS
"We flew home from Cape Town International on Friday 20th with BA into London Heathrow. No panick at all. Everything was calm and we went through check in, passport control etc with ease."
"I’m airside at Cape Town airport international departures right now. The airport is almost deserted. It took me just under 6 minutes to get through both security and passport control. I could have done it in 3 minutes I think. I took an unusually long time at the x-ray machine putting phone, keys etc into my bag but that didn’t matter because there was no one behind me to hold up. At passport control there were 4 or 5 passport counters open and only me and 2 other people to process so I was able to walk straight up to an empty booth where I lost another 2 minutes because I think I must have been the first passenger that that passport officer had processed today & she took about 2 minutes setting today’s date on her exit stamp machine.The bad news though is that if you’re entitled to get into the BA or Emirates lounges they are both closed due to the Coronavirus."
JulianGood news you completed the formalities quickly.Emirates will be suspending ALL flights from 25 March.No lounges open in Dubai.
"Hi. Our old au pair stopped to visit us here in the DC area on her way home and is set to leave Thursday with her Visa expiring. Her flight on SAA was canceled last Friday so the agency is looking into rescheduling. Anyone have any good info on which airlines might still be arriving out of the States? She's flying into Johannesburg with final destination of Durban. When we visited, we flew on SAA, but I know there are other options like Delta, Qatar, etc. Thank you! Take care everyone!"
"Not many are still flying but you can try Ethiopian. But she better do it as soon as possible as more restrictions should be announced tonight. Assuming she is South African, I would also have he contact her embassy to see if they can help, and at the very least let them know her situation. Good luck."
"Thank you. Yes, she is from Durban. The agency said they are going to wait until closer to the date b/c she has had two flights canceled, but I'm frustrated they're not looking to pull it forward. I will reach out to the Embassy here in DC. Thank you!"
"She needs to go ASAP, it is already past the time to get out. I hope it works out."
Just seen the new statement about travellers who have arrived from 9th march onwards having to serve a period of 14 days quarantine. We have been here 14 days tomorrow and are due to fly home. Anyone now if we will be allowed?
You will be allowed to leave.But check your airline is still flying.
"Thanks, it appears the flight is running. Just worried about us not being allowed to leave although I would assume they would rather we just went home"
Been told by the embassy they are unsure whether I will be able to board the flight. If anyone is flying from sa to a high risk country today would be useful to know how you get on! Thanks
"Generally speaking returning to your country of permanent residence/citizenship is considered essential travel and is permitted as long as flights are operating.A direct flight back to the UK is the best chance of success right now, connections via the UAE/Qatar/Europe are likely to be more of a problem or even completely impossible."
Hi we are meant to be on a flight out on Friday. Any information on whether we will we be allowed to drive to the airport after the lockdown. Also will only have been here 13 days so will we be allowed to leave. Been staying in an apartment.
"This ""Generally speaking returning to your country of permanent residence/citizenship is considered essential travel and is permitted as long as flights are operating.""Moving outside of the property in order to take a flight to your country of residence or citizenship will be allowable, as will leaving the country before the 14 days of quarantine are up. As said above, ideally you will have a flight direct back to your country or residence / citizenship, as many of the transit options (like UAE) are now closed."
Yes you will be permitted to travel to the Airport. Essential travel is permitted.
Thanks for the input. Currently the flight is happening so fingers crossed for Friday.
"Fingers crossed for you PhilB. I hope you get back home safely.For others I'm afraid the situation is now looking tricky (and I suspect that was an example of British understatement).I got out on Monday but have friends who have been trying for the last 2 days to get out. They went to Cape Town airport yesterday with a tickets already booked only to discover that it was no longer a valid routing. Technically the first leg of their trip was still flying, the Emirates departure to Dubai, but by the time it landed all viable onward connecting flights would have stopped running and foreign nationals are barred from entering U.A.E. at the moment so Emirates refused to let my friends check in and were only allowing U.A.E. nations to board. There was then a mad rush to book other flights with huge queues at all airlines ticket counters. The only guaranteed availability was on Qatar the following day but at a price of £4,000 each (economy class!) back to London, a price my friends weren't willing/able to pay.Options really are running out now for people wanting to get home. If anyone does want to get home and has maybe been procrastinating or been unwilling to pay higher prices for an earlier ticket home then I urge you to take action now. It might well already be too late, Emirates for instance is no longer an option because all of its flights out have stopped, but at least make every effort you can otherwise you will either have to wait out the lock down in South Africa, and who know if that might be extended and if it is then for how long for, or else hope that your government lays on repatriation flights.My other piece of advice would be to be careful of using third party booking sites and instead try to go straight to the airline sites. In trying to help my friends get out yesterday we found a few instances where booking sites were showing availability on routes (e.g. I thought that I had found them a route out via KLM when a search site showed it as the one route still with availability) but when I went to the KLM website directly it showed no availability which was subsequently confirmed once one of my friends got to the front of the queue for the KLM counter at Cape Town.Best of luck to everyone trying to get home, and best wishes to everyone - trapped visitors and residents alike - riding out the storm in South Africa and elsewhere in the World."
Thanks for all the info JulianS. I also wish everyone around the world all the best as they ride out the Covid19 pandemic.
"As far as I understand there will be no flights in or out, nor will there be any domestic flights after midnight tomorrow (i.e. from Friday onwards) until the end of the lockdown."
Yes just got email from embassy saying that. PhiliB see if you can get another flight tomorrow otherwise prepare to hanker down.Email also said no alcohol sold so everyone else stock up on wine & beer now :)
Our flight was brought forward but we were the last flight to leave Cape Town. Thankfully the control tower allowed us to leave 15 minutes after lockdown.
Thanks for all the messages and help. The Western Cape is beautiful and well worth visiting once we can all safely travel again
