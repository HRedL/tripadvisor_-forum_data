"Has anyone been to Tahiti since this restriction and have any sense of what they need for the covid tests. Here we have amplification tests and rapid tests , but not sure they will be accepted by Tahiti . So worried!"
It needs to be a PCR test and must say so on your results. You also need to fill out a ETIS form.
It's all spelled out here:https://tahititourisme.com/en-us/covid-19/
"Jessica - as Sue mentioned it has to be PCR. the test result must say PCR on it. I have a friend who I am chatting with now, she was flying from LAX last night and said the gate agent didnt let her board! Cos hers was a rapid same day PCR test - so weird cos it said PCR on it! She had to fly back home after not being able to board."
Oh no!!! This is my fear
"I just called Air Tahiti Nui to ask why people were denied boarding. Make sure the test that you get also dosent say ""rapid"" or ""antigen"" anywhere. It has to say PCR and SARS COV 2.."
"Sorry to hear that Jyotsna; as far as I can tell that’s malpractice on the part of ATN because some RT-PCR tests are ‘rapid’ i.e. with same-day or 45-minute results (I’m thinking of e.g. the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test). Such a test is in full compliance with posted entry requirements and is a full genomic RT-PCR test, yet may be marketed as a ‘rapid’ test by some providers. The requirement is that the test be a RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test, not that it take 6 hours to run…."
"I know its so scary that we are at the mercy of the gate agent and how they interpret it! I only fly in 2 weeks so Il be talking to my friend later today to find out what actually happened to her at the gate..Edited: 2:24 pm, July 23, 2020 "
"It’s very concerning, esp as I will be connecting via the west coast and would be devastated to make it out there with compliant documentation only to be turned away by an overwhelmed and mistaken gate agent. What a nightmare – I would appreciate any further details you could share about what exactly happened to your friend at the gate…."
I agree .. once I hear any details I’ll certainly let you know.
"Yeah that is scary. I thought as long as it said ""PCR"" on the test it would be ok for boarding. Let us know what you find out."
"Joyatsna, everyone beat me to it. And what you said (""at the mercy of the gate agent"") is concerning....I spoke with ATN agent just now who confirmed what we already know: take the PCR test, nothing else, the test must say PCR and read negative. I asked her: so if I take the PCR nasal test at Reliant BUT I get the test results back in 15 min, it doesnt matter as long as I'm negative, right? And she said yes, but make sure it's the PCR test. I'll be following this post for YOUR update. Sorry to hear about your friend though. That's gotta hurt...."
"And I fully agree with Owen. Someone needs to inform the gate agents this. If the friend took the correct test (and not the antigen one), she should've been able to board."
"Wow, such a bummer. I saw Yesh's post on FB that she witnessed people being denied boarding and she was flying from Paris, thru Canada, right?I am just going to take the regular PCR test and PRAY we get it back in less than 72 hours, Colton did say that they saw people who just showed the results on their phones (didn't have actual print outs) so that buys us a little extra time if we don't get the results before we leave for the airport. We have a 1:20pm flight out of SFO. I am thinking of leaving my house at 10:15am (40 minute drive). I wanted to get their early because of all the extra check-in stuff but I will probably push that to 10:30-10:45 if we don't have results yet!!So stressful"
Cupcake - from what I saw on reliants site and when I spoke to them that 15 minute test says antigen . Copying this from the reliant website :“Now Offering Results in 15 Minutes - Nasal Swab Antigen Test”So even if it’s nasal swab it says antigen ; maybe do the regular PCR self pay for 160 instead of this one for 200 ..that seems like the safer option...
"Jyotsna, good point. I've already paid for the test though, but perhaps they can use the excess funds to expedite my test and put the correct verbiage on my NEGATIVE test results LOL I'll ask, what's the worst that could happen? :-)"
Yes :) good luck cupcake! plus arent you also doing the Kaiser test before you leave? I Think you will be fine ! :)
"Yup, I'm doing Kaiser the morning of, and Reliant that evening. Because I had a panic attack lol. I just read ATN's website update and they have nixed the rapid RT PCR test so a big BOOOOOOO to them and a pox on all of their chickens. This is very last minute to throw out a new change. So now I'm about to call my besties at Reliant and change my test. Le sigh."
"Good luck Cupcake!!! I have spent a good 2 hours today trying to figure out how to get our 16 year old daughter's test results after we take the Covid test!! Stanford says they can't release them to me AND she is not old enough to have her own MyHealth account! WTH??I filled out some consent form, talked to two different people and one of them was nice and said he would try to figure out how we could handle it!Jeez.... seems to always be some sort of roadblock or stress with this trip......"
Do you need to be a member of Kaiser to get that ? I have spent all day trying and having a panic attack. Booked 3 tests and don’t think any will work (they don’t think results will come in fast enough)
Yes I think for Kaiser you have to be a member but Stanford in the Bay Area is doing free tests for all. Also check out project baseline by verily they do PCR tests .
"I read IG Travel Blogger Eatlivetraveldrink and she was denied access on Air Tahti Nui. So sad. It looks like they are denying any Rapid tests including PCR ones that come back the same day.Also, be sure to read the reviews for Project Baseline by VerifyEdited: 9:22 pm, July 23, 2020 "
"Nicole ( eatlivetraveldrink) is a fellow travel blogger and my friend that I was talking about ... Air Tahiti Nui has now updated their site to say no rapid RT PCR, no antigen and no antibody tests . It has to say “SARS-Cov2-COVID-19 RT PCR”. I got a sample of how my clinic’s result sheet looks and it very clearly says that so I am a little relieved now. Sue - about project baseline good point checking it I haven’t looked at it thoroughly only cos I’m no longer testing in the Bay Area now."
"It’s a distinction without a difference on the part of ATN, I’m afraid.As you can see by this charthttps:/…205.24.20_388526_284_36854_v1.pdfthere are variety of machines that offer SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR diagnostic capability, with various capacities and speeds.Whether or not your test is run on the GeneXpert or the TaqPath should have no bearing on the validity of the result. The two platforms should have more or less the same sensitivity and accuracy.And of course, whether your result is returned on the same day or two weeks later shouldn’t have any bearing on its validity.At the end of the day, if it’s a RT-PCR test, whether it is labeled as ‘rapid’ or ‘real-time’ or not is simply marketing. Quite discouraging to see that ATN is getting confused by the language, although admittedly it is complicated.I REALLY hope this misunderstanding doesn’t propagate to the main Tahiti Tourism guidance.Edited: 10:05 pm, July 23, 2020 "
Any word on if United out of SFO is accepting the rapid RT-PCR tests?
"We probably won’t know until United starts flying to PPT in August, but the term ‘rapid RT-PCR’ is really misleading. I got a SARS-CoV-2 test via Bioreference a few weeks ago, which is a large national laboratory doing the kind of test that ATN wants. But the results say ‘Real time RT-PCR.’ That means they used one of the same machines that could be used to give a ‘rapid’ result, as real-time PCR machines generally return results in 45 minutes to 2 hours. My point is that I don’t believe ATN can define ‘rapid RT-PCR.’ I think they want to avoid the antigen tests and the Abbott REAL ID NAAT tests, which are less precise. But ‘rapid RT-PCR’ cannot be defined, unless they want to exclude real time RT-PCR tests, which make up a large swath of the national laboratories’ testing capacity, at which point they might as well just re-close borders."
"Just found this thread after posting my experience on another board. I received my COVID test results from Reliant earlier today, and their report DOES NOT state that it is a PCR test anywhere on the report. The email containing the report does state:""Attached please find COVID-19 PCR Lab results."" I will be calling ATN tomorrow to see what they need as Reliant was (initially) their recommended lab for testing. Not sure if that matters anymore. My flight is Saturday evening, so I'll find out either way. As a backup, I did get tested through Los Angeles' Curative testing system, and that report shows""COVID-19 Negative"" and it also states the test was a PCR test. I'm hoping one of these two test reports works."
"Good morning Jyotsna and Others!I just spoke with Reliant about the nasal swab/antigen/rapid test fiasco. As a recap I was booked (and pre-paid) for the rapid RT-PCR test BEFORE ATN and Tahiti Tourisme updated their websites. I called Reliant at 7 am EST and got through with no issue. I told the nurse I was booked for PCR Nasal Antigen and the airline won't accept that. She told me when I come in to let the receptionist know and they will change my test to the PROPER Covid test needed for the flight. I asked about turnaround time, and she said 48 hrs but to check back in 24 upon completion of the test. Potential kerfluckle avoided. Many thanks to the good folks who pinged me and mentioned me in posts so I could be prepared. :-) ""we're all in this together"" LOL"
"Cupcake - so glad you changed it ! I was pretty sure that 15 minute one wasn’t accepted. I also had a chance to speak to my friend . She did a rapid PCR but this was before ATN has updated their website. They updated their website after her incident which is really ridiculous! When she emailed Tahiti Tourism and told them what happened, they told her rapid RT PCR is acceptable ! So I’m really not sure what is going on with the airline .. For instance what if your regular test from reliant that you take ( which is not rapid anymore ) actually comes back within 24 hours cos the lab wasn’t backed up. Are the agents just assuming what’s rapid or not based on how long it took to receive results ?! Which is so ridiculous.."
"Jyot-Isnt this really par for the course with the misinformation?So, Tahiti tourism was good with the rapid test but not ATN?Oy. Vey."
"Update- thanks to Jyotsnacs, I learned Stanford does PCR tests and results come back in 2 days or less. Hope I can pay it forward and help anyone else who needs it!"
"Andrew - Yeah thats what my friends screenshots show you can see in her IG stories (eatlivetraveldrink). I think its just best to avoid any rapid tests or anything that says ""rapid"" on it. Jessica - happy to help!"
"Jessica - I am getting mine at Stanford as well and they are promising 2 days so fingerscrossed!! I booked our appointment exactly 72 hours before our flight.I agree with Jyotsna = I think any reference to Rapid on our forms is not good. I think it just makes the test look like the wrong kind. I don't think they have any problem with 24, 48 hours. I think the problem lies with 1 -3 hour Rapid tests of any kind. I really hope Stanfords will not have any reference to Rapid and will clearly show it is a PCR test."
"I actually emailed ATN a screenshot of my covid test in April to make sure it is acceptable. Its PCR but only says Covid-19. If I get it in writing saying its acceptable, dam skippy I am going to print it off just in case."
"Andrew - I am printing copies of everything too! Covid tests, ETIS form, Itinerary, everything!!"
"Wishing you safe travels and good luck on your upcoming flights!!!! Yesterday the government announced that they started tested 1,500 out of the 3,000+ self covid test and so far they all came back negative, that's really great! I have only been to Tahiti and Moorea since I made it back here, but it's nice to see that most people are getting used to wearing the mask. I was also a bit nervous (based on the news I was reading prior to July 15) that some local would fear or avoid tourists but it has not been the case. I know one island in the Austral is refusing international tourists but that is an exception. Most places are happy to start working again. The restaurants in Moorea were packed and busier than last time I was here in January before covid which is really good to see!"
"That is great news, thanks for the update Tim!I had been wondering how things were going with the COVID testing numbers. Not having any positive cases yet is very encouraging! I hope that continues :)"
Tim - Fantastic news about the Covid tests and restaurants in Moorea. I have been watching Colton’s trip in Bora Bora and it looks like it is fantastic too!I bet your family is thrilled to see you!11 days and countingSue
"Ia ora na! Just to clarify, the test results must show it is an RT-PCR test, not just PCR. You can find the exact guidelines here: https://tahititourisme.com/en-us/covid-19/ Māuruuru!"
Tahiti Tourisme - thank you for confirming!
Ia ora na! There has been no change on the Tahiti Tourisme website regarding the type of test. It remains RT-PCR. No tests are specifically excluded as long as it is RT-PCR.
Has anyone traveled through LA and found a clinic that lists results as RT-PCR as specified. Please advise. Thanks so much!
What is the best place to test in San Diego area to get results in 48 hours? We can drive to LA also
"Reliant Urgent Care just called ME. I was shocked LOL. The nurse said my test was the wrong one for flight entry (I had signed up for the 15 min rapid PCR test PRIOR to the change of requirements). I told her that I tried to change the test over the phone with another nurse with no luck. She understood. Said for me to try online with the change and if no luck, not to forget to mention I need the nasal RT PCR test when I check in. Since we were on the phone I asked about turnaround time; she said 72 hours, maybe sooner. I also asked if their test read ""Sars Cov 19 RT PCR"" etc and she said yup, the nasal test thats NOT the 15 min rapid antigen test will allow you to fly. I'm going to see if I can make changes online now...."
Thank you so much for the update cupcakelovah. Will you please keep us posted how the process goes and confirm if the results specify RT-PCR? Thank you!
So my test from my provider in April was the nasal and way up there for ten seconds. My results were negative but the test is listed as Covid-19 PCR. Nothing with RT.Is this going to be unacceptable?
Disregard my previous post. I found it says real time pcr.
Andrew - You may want to still call your provider and check. The RT in RT PCR stands for “Reverse Transciption” and not real time . Real time PCR is also an assay but it might be different. I used to work in science and perform PCRs too; from my memory there were different types of PCRs so that’s why I think it’s best to check ..
Well thats disconcerting.Ok thank you.
"I don’t understand the distinction in this case as from what I have learned the viral genome consists of only RNA (no DNA). Therefore any SARS-CoV-2 PCR test must first reverse transcribe the RNA into DNA. Can anyone provide evidence of a single SARS-CoV-2 PCR test that does not perform reverse transcription from RNA into DNA? My point is, I believe there DOES NOT EXIST a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test that is not RT-PCR."
Owen - you must be right especially cos you seem to understand the science behind it the best . I guess ATN just wants that particular language? Hopefully they clarify things and make it simpler in the near future ..
"Owen-Thanks for that. But, you know in this world using logic and reason is crazy thinking. We are flying to LA specifically to get a covid test early. We have a ocean view in Santa Monica so life aint all that bad."
"FYI for anyone traveling on a Saturday or Sunday flight. I received this message from the ATN recommenced testing site, Good Life:“ Please understand that we cannot guarantee the lab will be able to process in time for that flight. Even with expedited fees which is paid on site. Because of results needed on Sunday. We recommend a Monday test for a Wednesday or Thursday flight. Any other questions please let us know.”Anyone having any luck with a clinic in LA that will get you results with the proper verbiage of RT-PCR and in the 72 hour timeframe? So stressful!"
"Hello everyone. As an update to me previous post, we've made it to PPT on ATN's Saturday flight. I spent a few days stressing out trying to ensure we got our test results in time, and with the proper verbiage. We got tested at Reliant Urgent Care right after midnight on Wednesday and received results within 36 hours. As I stated in my previous post, the Reliant paperwork DOES NOT state anywhere that the test was RT-PCR. This caused me to freak out for two days. I contacted both ATN and Reliant numerous times during this period to see if ATN would accept this lab report given it was recommended by them. The first agent told me it would be no problem, but that I should also print the email I received from Reliant containing the results that stated in the body of the email that the test was a PCR test. She also told me that the results can NOT state anywhere that the test was a RAPID or ANTIGEN test. Still the email from Reliant no mention of RT anywhere. I called ATN again to see if that would be an issue, but that second agent was unhelpful, and just kept referring me back to the website. I went to Reliant's LAX location twice to see if they could add the verbiage needed to the lab report, but the folks there said their standard report has been accepted by ATN with zero issues for the past few weeks, and they have no ability to change the report as it comes from an outside lab. Reliant also told me that whenever the airline has had any questions, the ticket agents have just been calling Reliant's LAX 24 hour office for clarification. After all this, we decided to go very early for check in today, and after a mini panic attack, we had no problems at all. The airline staff who inspected the report seemed to be familiar with Reliant's report, and from I understand, the two companies have a good relationship. I was also told by Reliant that when they initially set up the partnership, Reliant had sent over detailed information about the type of testing being performed, so ATN may be using that as a blanket coverage for all Reliant test results. I was told the partnership between ATN and Reliant has not ended, but that because Reliant was getting a little overwhelmed with the number of tests, they could no longer guarantee the 72 hours. You can still book the FastPass COVID test on their website, but there's no longer a discounted price for ATN. I did see some people being pulled aside during check in, that I eventually did not see on the flight, so it does appear some are being turned away for whatever reason. The flight itself was not anywhere near full. Some people even spread out so they could have their own rows.Hope this helps everyone who has been stressed out about this. Definitely a crazy process as none of the COVID tests I've taken the last few months have stated RT on the results, and some haven't even stated that the test was PCR. I'm going to go enjoy a nice cold drink as soon as possible. Good luck to everyone!"
"TUP, thank you for this blessed update. May you have sunny skies, warm water, and cheap excursions awaiting you in Tahiti :-)"
"TUP - YAY!! So happy for you!! I pray your trip will be the trip of a lifetime with all SMOOTH SAILING from here on out!!I have the same worries about how my results will be worded. We are taking our test at Stanford next Saturday and flying on United. I haven't heard from anyone else who has taken their test at Stanford yet so I am not sure if there will be any issues. I know for a fact that they do use the Covid RT-PCR test but will it say it and can I prove it at the airport if United questions it!! I know ATN has an agreement with the certain clinics but United does not PLUS we are on the very first flight heading out of SFO to Papeete since the shutdown. Always seems to be a little something to be anxious about. But you have made it there, now go enjoy everything and report to us Must/Must-Not Do's in all the islands!!!Cheers!! Sue"
The family took the covid test today at Reliant. Fingers crossed.
Andrew!! Sending you all positive vibes!! Can't wait to hear how long it takes! Fingers crossed all smooth sailing from here on out!!Sue
Thanks Sue!
"Good luck to you, Sue and Andrew. Sue, I’ll be a couple days behind you leaving on that Thursday. I know you have prepared carefully so I hope you enjoy smooth travel! I know all the small changes and unannounced policy decisions can drive a person up a wall but I believe it will work out for you and wish you both amazing trips. Andrew – I’m still down to meet you on Bora Bora toward the end of your visit! Same to you Jyotsna and the other fine people who have been sharing advice and plans; it’s nice to know others are trying to navigate the same situation. Best wishes.Edited: 12:29 am, July 27, 2020 "
Good luck Sue and Andrew ! Can’t wait to hear more about your trip.Owen - wish you the same ! I was scheduled to leave the same day as you - Aug 6th ? Now ATN has me scheduled for Aug 7th lol I hope that’s the last change for now. Keeping my fingers crossed and good vibes to all of you.
Good luck Andrew! Fingers crossed for you!
Thank you to everyone on this thread. I love fellow travelers helping each other. I will be flying August 6 and staying mostly in Moorea with few days in bora bora at end. Would be fun to meet you all there and cheers to making it paradise safely and healthy.
"Thanks so much Owen. Hoping we all test and get negative, CORRECTLY WORDED results LOL.Jyotsna - ATN moved your flight date? That is a little annoying with hotels, transportation, etc. I am thankful (and praying) that United does not move our flight! I have been checking every couple of days to see how many of the seats are full on our flight.Jessica - where are you staying on Moorea? We get to Moorea on the 11th.All good vibes these next couple weeks!!5 days until testing8 days until flightSue"
"For anyone who has to cancel due to the problems with getting testing done on time, please contact Tahiti Tourism and the FP government to let them know that their testing regimen is causing problems for American visitors. Perhaps Tahiti will give a few more days to get the test done. Someone needs to let them know why people are having to cancel at the last minute."
Hi Sue! I will be at the Hilton on Moorea :)
Sue - yes they changed their entire August schedule so now no more changes! Luckily I could secure hotel dates and extended my trip by an extra 2 days in the end cos of this so its fine :). testing wise I am changed my date too .. fingers crossed for all of us!
Jessica - we will be there too. We are doing Tahiti and Bora Bora first though and Moorea at the end.Sue
"We had to postpone our trip (originally in April, then again for this week) because it was impossible to have our 10 year old tested due to PCR guidelines only testing children for medical needs in the US. Our pediatrician even put the request in as a “procedure” and it was still denied. I called Tahiti Tourism, asking if BOTH parents have negative PCR results and our child shows a regular negative COVID19 test, would that be acceptable...the answer was NO. It MUST be a PCR test for any & everyone. She said they understand it is hard for many to find testing and definitely a challenge within 72 hours but they set these parameters because need to keep their island safe due to lack of hospitals. She also said they will not be relaxed guideline anytime soon. If you do have children that need to test, Reliant in LA does test children but they need a full 72 hour window and she said they are very overwhelmed with testing so she couldn’t assure us enough that we’d get our results in time. We were flying from the East Coast to SFO so it would have put us at more of a risk, catching COVID, to go to LA 3 days before to wait for results before we flew to Mo’orea!?! Oh well, here’s to next year. Good luck to all!"
"Jess- so sorry to hear that! I know it is disappointing for sure. I do understand that the number one priority for French Polynesia has to be keeping their people Covid free and the 72 hour window really is the safest way, along with testing people 4 days in.We test this Saturday and I am just trying to stay positive that we will get our results back in time!!Take care.Sue"
"Anyone have experience flying United from SFO and getting aboard with test results from LabCorp? It is a PCR test, but not on the official approved list from Tahiti Tourism."
"@Suel3754 How did it go and where did you get tested? Im flying out of SFO this Thuirsday and I'm so stressed out.Edited: 10:00 pm, August 15, 2020 "
"Hi Catarina,We just got home yesterday. It was a great trip!! I needed it so badly. We tested at Stanford's drive thru testing site in Palo Alto."
"https://mydoctorsf.com/covid-19-testingthere's this doctor in San Francisco downtown, are used to work with him at the hospital and he's a very nice guy! I would also call insurance about reimbursement as this cost a pretty penny but if it's worth the runaround it should be OK, double check on the wording as this website says QRT-PCR. But it sounds legit to me, good luck!"
"Sue, did you have to get a doctor's referral? We have test paperwork, but in the event that it is not accepted, we'll be scrambling for a backup plan while in San Francisco. This one seems like a good option, I just don't know what is required to get tested here. I am not from California...does that matter?"
"@Adam A , where did you get the test in Tampa?"
