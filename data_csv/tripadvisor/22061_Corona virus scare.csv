"Hi all, we were planning a trip to Paris,Disneyland and Switzerland in mid march this year. With the Corona virus scare going around everywhere,how good or bad is the idea of travelling now? We are from Oman where no cases have been reported yet..and we have 2 kids along!"
"1. What does your government advise?2. If you're that worried, stay home."
"Well, I wouldn’t plan any trips to Wuhan.As far as Paris goes, the (very few) only cases were picked up in China as far as I know. Right now in Paris you are at greater risk of seasonal flu.There was a small cluster of Corona virus cases at a ski resort in France, all people who had shared a ski chalet with a man who apparently had caught the virus in Singapore and brought it into France with him. But that was in a different part of France, not Paris. No one else in that area caught it, only the people living in the house with him. And none of those cases was very serious.Travel away from home always involves some risk of exposure to things you wouldn’t be exposed to at home, but for most people it’s not a major risk unless there are underlying health issues....as long as you keep all your regular immunizations up-to-date and are careful about washing your hands and paying attention to what you eat.But information is being updated all the time, so all depends on your own level of concern and whether you will be too worried to go anywhere.Edited: 8:39 am, February 18, 2020 "
Thank you so much
There are antithetical views about traveling while the Corona pandemic is going strongly. Perhaps a medical forum would be a more suitable venue to seek advice appertaining Coronavirus.
"you know the answer. Travel increases your risk especially when there is a poorly controlled pandemic underway. You have to decide how high the risk is and if you are willing to run it. We have a trip scheduled April/May to Paris -- Unless things are a lot worse before then we will be going. Travel insurance does not cover such cancellations. but we know that it increases the odds of exposure. Just this week we learned that Japanese tourists infected with Corona spent a week in Hawaii and then flew home on a Delta flight potentially infecting dozens of others. The British man who contracted Corona in Singapore infected several people in Switzerland and then got on an Easyjet and exposed more people and then infected several people when he got to London. Travel always increases risk of exposure to anything out there. Anyone who travels should always have up to date vaccinations for Flu, hepatitis, and all the 'childhood illness' like measles, polio etc as those things are all out there."
"An elderly friend of mine (upper 80's) cancelled her spring visit to Paris, where she spends 3 months at a time, not because of covid-20 but because of the ""normal"" flu epidemic currently raging through France. Past a certain age, additional precautions are necessary."
"The British man who came from Singapore infected other British people in the villa where he was staying in France. Those people are now in hospital in France. I am unaware that he also went to Switzerland, unless that was just a mistake in post 5."
Yeah I thought it was a Swiss villa and apparently it was in the French alps. But he managed to fly while contagious from Singapore to france and to Spain before getting on another public transport jet to England where he infected 5 more.This thing will not be stopped -- the best hope is that it gets delayed a season for areas outside Asia.

"we saw our doc on Thurs and I asked him about going to Paris. I usually go in Feb or March. He felt it was not a full blown epidemic yet, but suggested I wait a month or so before going."
"The real answer is that no one knows. I wouldn't go to Wuhan. I would go to Paris. If I had a baby or had medical problems, I might worry more.Have you all had your flu shots? Lots of flu around."
"I had my regular flu shot last October. But since I am getting real old everything hits harder, several years ago, maybe 7 or 8, I got sick in Paris. Out of a ten day trip, I probably spent 5 days not quite flat in bed but close to it. I didn't want to go to a French doc at that time, now i would say that that was plain stupidity."
"Yes. it's definitely harder as people get older, your immune system just doesn't work as well. Although with viruses, there's not much a dr can do for you anyway. It's awful being sick when you're away from home. I think it's probably a good idea to go out of flu season, although then I guess you also miss the lowest prices."
#9 Janet do please get your facts right or post nothing if you know (obviously) nothing about the case. He DID NOT fly to Spain. He flew Singapore stopped at the ski resort in France and then flew to London.
"I was scared when this started spinning in December. Now months later it feels like fake mainstream news. So was it bat soup or the biological weapons laboratory next to the bat soup café? Bus drivers smiling, laughing wearing only t-shirts transporting hundreds of highly contagious patients. I think pharmaceuticals jumped the shark by patenting the virus in 2015. Will Bill Gates get the lucrative vaccine contract.."
"** He felt it was not a full blown epidemic yet, but suggested I wait a month or so before going **Perhaps, April will be the safe month to resume travel. President Trump predicted the Coronavirus will go away by April, as the weather warms up :-)"
Yes it was a ski resort in the French not Swiss Alps and one of those folks carried it to Spain -- he has been viewed as a superspreader and infected about a dozen people -- some in the french alps and some in London -- we have no idea if any of the passengers he flew with from France to London on Easyjet were infected. So the bones of the story are accurate. One guy at a conference carried the disease to several other places and infected others without being seriously sick himself; he has since recovered after being hospitalized in London. The point is that air travel increases the risk for travelers but also for communities as people zip around the world contagious even when apparently not sick or terribly sick themselves.
"From the facts reported, it does not appear anyone has caught this from just being on a plane. In the case of the British man who apparently caught the virus in Singapore and then unknowingly infected several people with whom he shared a ski chalet in the French alps, there have been no other reported cases attributable to him other than the few people with whom he was sharing the chalet. In Europe, Fear Spreads Faster Than the Coronavirus Itselfhttps:/…Those who travel to Europe right now are still at far greater risk of seasonal flu, which can also be deadly to the elderly or young children or those with compromised immunity. There is an annual flu vaccine, which everyone should have already had this winter, to help protect against seasonal flu; no guarantee that you might not get sick, but certainly can help minimize severity if you do.There is no vaccine available (yet) against this new Coronavirus; but good hygiene (wash your hands!) can certainly help protect you from any germs whether you travel or choose to stay home. Right now there is no more Coronavirus threat in Paris than anywhere else outside of Asia."
you really don't want my response to your comment about Trump and his take on the virus do you?
"Hello, I am going to Paris next month with my wife and 2 children. We are Asian Americans, coming from Miami. We are more concerned about the anti-Asian sentiment towards Asians than the actual virus. Is there really a lot of racism in Paris?"
"Mainstream news brain washed people will be afraid of anything or anyone. I remember when perfectly healthy friends of mine got caught up in the previous flu scare and got the toxic vaccine only to end up sick with the flu.Sheeple are people and will react to the news, fortunately the spinning panic has also focused on British, American, and other countries beyond China. That's good news for Asian tourists afraid of sheeple that are afraid, they're now are afraid of anyone thanks to the news. Hopefully your plane coming over isn't filled up with brain dead sheeple.Enjoy your visit to Paris. Speaking of, it's often mentioned that Asians are targeted by pickpockets because of their perpetuance to carrying large amounts of cash. In other words, pickpockets love Asians. The large department stores love Asians. Parisians love Asian cuisine restaurants. Paris has a Chinatown, probably the largest in Europe.Nothing but love for Asians, and some sheeple afraid of the fake news, if that is racism then I need to look the word up.."
"What is everyone's thoughts about visiting Paris now with the outbreak in Italy? We are supposed to leave next week, and feeling torn on what to do. We have been planning this trip for more than six months."
My thought is that France is a better place to go than Italy for one's health.
"I thought the common flu had a worse track record than this hype? The CDC says New York has over 100,000 cases of the common flu this season, there is not even a 100k cases of Corona around the world."
"Maybe look at what the WHO, CDC and other government bodies concluded from their simulation pandemic drill they practiced in October of 2019 last year to give you an idea of how they plan on dealing with this coincidental real virus outbreak, the drill even used the same name Corona, the drill hosted by Bill Gates was called EVENT 201: https://youtu.be/WA2B6eAu7vc"
We are on the brink of a world wide pandemic -- CDC acknowledges it can only be slowed not stopped -- it is already out of control in Italy. To pretend this is not a risk or it is no greater than season flu is ridiculous. The only question is how soon and how dangerous for France and the US.
"There is a vaccine to help protect against seasonal flu. No vaccine (yet) for this new coronavirus. So it is a different level of concern. From published reports to date, it seems that a very high percentage of reported corona virus illnesses have been relatively mild. Those who are at higher risk of severe complications are the elderly and those with underlying chronic conditions. Also has been reported that smokers are at higher risk of severe complications, as is also the case for flu and many other respiratory diseases. No one knows now what will happen as the virus travels. If anyone has an underlying health concern, I think your own doctor would be the best person to consult (not strangers on the internet).I do get annual flu shots, and have also have all other recommended regular immunizations (& boosters) as needed. And I wash my hands, a lot.And I don’t smoke. For the moment that’s the best any of us can do, I guess.I am not changing any travel plans; I figure my corona virus risk in Paris is probably the same as in NYC. I would not plan to go to Italy or Singapore or Korea or China at the moment, but I am not worried about going to France. (Last week I would not have avoided Italy, though.)Edited: 3:02 pm, February 24, 2020 "
"I'm not so worried about catching the virus on our upcoming trip at the end of March. I'm more worried about being quarantined overseas, if the virus should reach Paris. I mean, just looked at how they are locking down those quarantined towns in northern Italy right now. And/or not being let back into the US for a long time. I doubt my hotel would extend my stay that long, and I couldn't pay for it anyway. Wonder what it would take for the US to ban overseas travel if things spread exponentially to a bunch more countries?Edited: 3:11 pm, February 24, 2020 "
"Your travel insurance, if you have a decent policy, should cover the cost of an extended stay due to circumstances such as quarantine - as long as you hadn't travelled against your country's (or your doctor's) advice. Good idea to check before you go."
"If you are stuck in Paris because of an unlikely situation when all the flights to the US have been cancelled, and you are also unable to get a train to another European country to fly home from there, then most likely travel insurance would cover your extended Paris hotel stay. And I’m sure your hotel would be happy to extend your stay, since unlikely any new guests would be arriving who would need your room. There are worse places to be stranded than Paris.....But we’re not facing such a “doomsday” scenario at the moment.Register on the US State Dept website that you will be traveling and where, and in the case of any such emergency you would contact the US Embassy in Paris to find out what the plans are to repatriate US citizens. (But if you have your own health concerns that might put you at higher risk, though, consult your doctor. If your doctor says inadvisable to travel at this time, then your travel insurance would also cover cancellation.)Edited: 3:54 pm, February 24, 2020 "
The CDC and others said in the Event 201 video they will consider shutting down the internet so have a data plan for regular phone calls.
Thanks Adventure Tours. Will my carrier pigeon need a pet passport?
"It was reported today that the driver of a bus from Milan to Lyon was taken to hospital because he had flu-like symptoms. The passengers have been quarantined. The bus stopped in Grenoble before Lyon. Remains to be seen whether he has the Corona virus, but it indicates just how hard it will be to stop the spread of this with people crossing the border continuously. I have a trip planned to Paris, Provence and the Riviera in June. Holding my breath and waiting until the last minute to make any more nonrefundable reservations for trains, hotels and the like."
"travel insurance is very unlikely to pay for this -- extended stay, maybe, but canceling the trip because your doc recommends against it (unless you are actually disabled) not very likely. And the force majeure clauses may also come into play. I noticed that the company that provides medical evacuation insurance has basically cancelled it in the hot zones of China, Macau, South Korea etc."
"""This thing will not be stopped -- the best hope is that it gets delayed a season for areas outside Asia....We are on the brink of a world wide pandemic -- CDC acknowledges it can only be slowed not stopped -- it is already out of control in Italy.""This is hysteria. Janet - my guess is that you are not qualified to make these exaggerated statements. The World Health Organisation says the opposite of your claim about pandemic.""will not be stopped"" - ever? My local university has isolated the virus and is working on a vaccine. They are talking months - I'm pretty sure that CDC knows about that work.https:/…99-covid-19-vaccine-quest""Asia"" is not affected - China is not Asia, even if it is a country IN Asia.""Out of control in Italy""....pretty long country, Italy. Lombardy is not ""Italy"".It's not even ""out of control"" in China, the source. Plenty of maps to show where it is - no single country is marked out entirely.Sure, the action taken can be drastic - cities and regions shut down.The reports I have read is that it is the elderly - eeek! - who are most most at risk, mostly those with pre-existing conditions. So it might be prudent for those who consider themselves to be ""elderly"" to postpone travel, out of an abundance of caution. My concern would be that insurance companies may not cover you for travel to areas nominated as quarantine locations at the time you purchase your ticket or travel."
">> canceling the trip because your doc recommends against it (unless you are actually disabled) not very likely. <<Actually, we have had past experiences where we had to cancel trips because doctor said not to travel at present time, & had no problems cancelling hotels or flights and then rebooking at future date when doctor said okay to go. So depends on individual situation.(But cancelling or postponing due to anxiety, without doctor writing a letter that you need to postpone due to medical issue, is a different matter entirely.)Edited: 11:20 pm, February 24, 2020 "
"The last patient in France was released from the hospital yesterday after a full recovery, and there are currently no cases anywhere in France. But of course that is temporary."
"So for now France is ""safe"". According to the Australian Government travel website Australians are advised to ""Exercise a high degree of caution"" in France. And the blurb states:Strikes are continuing across France. Expect ongoing demonstrations and some disruptions to public transport and other public services. Avoid protests and demonstrations, monitor local media and check with your travel provider before travelling.So. France is already on the same level of caution as Seoul, where there is community spread of the virus (although not to the extent as in the two southern cities now affected extensively). If we listened to the travel advice of our government we wouldn't go to France if we were anxious. Still, I think I'd prefer to travel to France in April than to Seoul which is where we are meant to be going but may end up cancelling."
People in Paris were wearing masks on the metro yesterday.
"Michelle, have I got this right - you are saying that while Oz Gov travel advisories are at the same status for both France and Seoul, France is less of a ""risk""?In one case, if you are elderly and have compromised health, you might get very sick. In the other case, you might need to walk or get a taxi.Sometimes the classification system doesn't make much sense. Sometimes governments would rather be too careful rather than risk the embarrassment of being criticised because someone missed a plane due to a strike. A little of ""boy calls wolf"", I fear.This is the same France, by the way, that is building some Aus$60 billion worth of submarines for Australia."
"Masks on the Metro? Someone is making money. My dentist told me the other day that boxes (boxes, not cartons) of masks were selling in the hundreds of dollars here. Nuts."
"Youtube ""coronavirus paris"" sort for today and look at the Flixbus bus stuck in Lyon coming from Italy: https://youtu.be/-mIrO1W2O80You will also see a video about Paris' police station in the 13th on lockdown because a tourist walked in with a fever.Edited: 4:54 am, February 25, 2020 "
"I saw two or three people wearing masks in Paris today.The specialists have pointed out that the masks that people are buying in pharmacies are totally useless, because they are meant to keep sick people from contaminating others, not the reverse.Medical professionals use a different and considerably more expensive mask which must be changed every 4 hours."
"Since schools in Paris have just resumed after a holiday break, notices have been sent to families asking that any children who traveled to Italy or any other region where there has been a Coronavirus outbreak over the holiday period should stay home for 2 weeks before returning to their classes. Also any children who have any illness, even just minor colds & even if they have not been traveling, are being asked to stay home as well.(my daughter received such a notice even from her children’s music classes) So people have gotten very nervous in Paris since the outbreak in Italy.....(& also the hotel quarantine now in the Canary Islands, where a vacationing doctor from Italy has now been diagnosed with Coronavirus so an entire resort hotel has been put on temporary lockdown while all the other guests are tested)'Keep away from school', France tells kids returning from Italy rfi.fr/en/france/20200225-keep-away-school-f…"
"Here we go: we have two new cases in France, one of which is in Paris."
"Here ya go if curious...""It is a woman returned from China, hospitalized in Paris, and a man returning from Lombardy, cared for in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes."""
"Ok... don't shoot me, please ( or send the corona virus my way) but the CDC reports 16,000-41,000 DEATHS from the flu since October, with 29-41 MILLION illnesses. I am at far greater risk of getting the flu if I stay home than I am of getting the Corona virus if I visit Paris. Isn't everyone being slightly hysterical over this corona virus thing?Edited: 5:39 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"Finally a critical thinker on the forum.Careful though connecting dots not allowed. Let's share a beer, I have masks with straw holes.)Bravo Maine!"
"People are conflating 1- the physical risk of the disease and 2- the logistic risks of sites shutting down, disruptions to transit, quarantines and being locked in your room. Even is the flu is more dangerous on #1 (still unknown) the disruption (#2) caused by coronavirus is a huge harm. Too much unknown. Think of the probably healthy 1,000 tourists locked in their Spanish hotel."
