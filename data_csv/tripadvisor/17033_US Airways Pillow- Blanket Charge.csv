"Here is an article regarding the upcoming charge for a pillow blanket kit. It would have little impact on me--even when I was in first class and they were readily available, cant recall using one. Maybe on really long haul international flights. But they seem to be important to some.www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/item.aspxâ€¦"
Might have to sneak into 1st class and take one LOL.
a blanket has become a staple in my carryon backpack. I'm usually freezing on planes.I use my teddy bear for a pillow. : ) the airline ones have always kind of weirded me out.
i never use them- think they are dirty
"is aa doing it? if we ask they always give us brand new ones, still in the plastic."
"I find it amusing that people think the pillows are dirty but, have no problem leaning their heads back on the high back seats. Let's hope they don't install pay toilets on the planes. Then we can bring our own bedpans ...:)."
"yeah, it's not like they spray lysol or anything. i think i will be taking the wipes this time, but that is just because of my fear of germs."
"I just had a horrible experience with US Air. I knew about all their stupid nickle and dime you death rules, but my flight was ok 2 weeks ago...even though I told them and showed them half my suitcase was filled with toys for the Cancun orphanage Christmas they still charged me. I think for the price you pay you should get at least one free checked bag, and some free water, so anyway, whatever, That was a minor issue.  The problem was when my husband and dear friends did not get off the plane in Cancun at 3pm. I waited at the airport for almost 5 hours, and talked to everyone in US Air customer service, PR and even called corporate. They did not give a rats patootie. So finally I was convinced by Palace that maybe they were here at Aventura waiting for me so I got on the van...nope, no one was here. The Palace concierge and the PR desk helped me, plus I called friends at the newspaper, the ERs and the CHP (California Highway Patrol) looking for answers.  By midnight I was crying and so upset but it turned out that US Air had mechanical problems in Oakland and re-routed all the passengers via Aero Mexicana through Mexico City. Every one is safe and sound, but none of us had a good day.  I think it is ridiculous and heartless that US Air didn't just tell me that my family and friends were re-routed. Why cause all that worry and drama?  I am going to pursue this, because I don't want any one else to have so much stress and worry as they put us through. "
"BTW, b4 anyone calls me stupid, I had copies of everyones flight information and all the numbers...I did not call our or their children late at night because I did not want to worry them, but I did call every US Air official and public official I could find and so did Palace. The ONLY way I found out what had happened was when my husband called Aventura after getting off the plane. Palace picked them up and brought them here even though it was after hours.I understand the security issues if US Air doesn't want to give out specific passenger information, but for Gods sake, they could have at least told me or the resort that that flight was re-routed. I couldn't even un-pack or have a drink because for all I knew I would be flying out to attend some funerals.I am angry and upset with US Air \\\\\\\\\\\"
actually I think your story is a good reminder that when traveling separate you should always have contingency plans. to the original topic. I agree on the headrests as well. I prefer planes with leather seats (or faux) so I can wipe em down with a disinfectant cloth. 
"oh my God Ladybird, how awful!i would jut have been terrified! you poor thing.i am so glad everyone is safe."
"I hate USAir and will do anything possible to avoid flying it, but dont use airline blankets either. I know, everything in the plane is disgusting, but I try to minimize contact. Since I'm usually hot, I rarely need a wrap, and if I do, I have my own jacket. Sometimes I have a pashmina.... I bring my own tiny down travel pillow for use in hotels that only have rock hard ones, but would NEVER use it on the plane! ick!I travel as light as possible, with carry on luggage only. And, I always have some sort of power or granola bar for long tarmac waits. Unfortunately here in NYC they would consider any bag of food a carryon bag, so I have to buy food in the airport, and dont rely on any domestic airline - other than Jet Blue or Continental -to supply me any creature comfort any more."
"While on the subject of disgusting, avoid airline coffee. When I was with the airline, no employee would drink the coffee on the plane. The holding tanks for the water are often disgusting--and when the coffee is made, the water is not hot enought to kill the bacteria."
"Ladybird, sorry to hear about your stressful event. Glad everything worked out in the end. Did you try to check the status of the flight on the airline website too? Just curious because, I am always looking at the flight status prior to departing for the airport when expecting guests or to catch a flight. "
What do you mean you are going to pursue it?Are you going to sue US Air? Now that's funny my left coast friend.
"Oh for Gods sake JSS, I am not going to sue anyone, I just don't see the point of not telling me or the resort or anyone else that the 6am flight from Oakland was re-routed. They didn't even have to tell me or Palace or anyone else any confidential passenger information, but why on gods green earth couldn't they tell me and Palace that the flight had been diverted???>You don't have to like me but even so I think you can understand how much fun it was standing at the airport in Cancun eating 20 dollar fish tacos with a huge knot in your stomach when you should be at Aventura Spa Palace chillin in the Presidential suite..I am just sayin' "
"I see your point. I think you should walk up to the US Air ticket counter and punch the next clerk in the nose. Sort of reminds me of the airline worker in the movie ""Meet The Parents""""step aside sir""Sometimes, logic does not dictate..........."
Not again Ladybird............. Gods green earth.........................say it ain't so. I'm running out of room on my paper with haystacks. llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll 
"JSS and RTR, you people obviously have way too much time on your hands.USAir did not have to keep it a big secret that the Oakland flight was cancelled and diverted. There was no excuse not to answer me and make me wait all day at the airport, not to mention the time that was wasted by me, the concierge, the Palace public relations desk, the many calls to CHP, hospitals and newspaper desks, friends and family...hours wasted in worry when all USAir had to do was just say the flight was cancelled for mechanical failure and was rerouted.It is just common courtesy. "
"We get the point. BTW, time to have your trifocal prescription checked. It's JJS, not JSS, for the second time. ""Step aside Maam"""
Birdlady:Any truth to the rumor that an epidemic of dyslexia is sweeping through the Cancun hotel zone? LOL 
Ladybird -Did you bring your cell phone? They're a life saver when traveling and would have allowed your husband to get a hold of you. We have Verizon which works great in Cancun for us and even into the Riviera Maya. Might be worth checking into given the amount of time you spend down there.

"You are really a piece of work...I agree the airline should have told you the flight was changed, but I was just simply pointing out that maybe your husband and friends could have called you on your cell phone or the hotel once they found out their flights were changed. "
"R2R,JJS, & CY9,Try a little empathy! The Lady had a bad experience why be so hostile?Ladybird,I would be upset too! Your family and friends were probably out of cell phone contact, due to the fact that most airlines ask people to turn them off until they're on the ground. USAir asks for contact numbers incase the flights are changed. Why didn't they use that information? I'm totally in agreement with you they should have notified you of the change.Thankfully, it ended on a positive note."
"Ladybird,I'm sure that was a scary experience for you and I'm glad everything turned out fine. In you ever find yourself in this unfortunate position again, speak to law enforcement personnel at the airport and ask them to accompany you to the airline counter. The airline personnel cannot give out passenger info, however they can give it to the police. I worked for an airline for 20yrs and this is the only way that an airline agent can release this info."
"Thank you all for your concern, and thank whatever gods that everything was ok. My family and friends know me very well and knew I would be freaking out, and they did call the numbers on their reservation papers...but as we all know it is hard enough to get in touch with the office in Miami and \\whatever...finally, as I mentioned earlier, I got a message from the hotel operator, when the concierge, security and Public Relations could not get through or get any answers.Wait till it happens to you. I will sympathize and do everything I can to help you.Remember the rules of karma and that what goes around comes around! "
