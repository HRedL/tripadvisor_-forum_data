"Hello,I will be travelling with my family, including a 3 month old staying at Villa La Estancia. Dengue concerns me for my newborn, given he cannot have any bugspray with DEET. I was in Costa Rica last year, without the newborn and had my 5 year old use an ""organic"" spray with no DEET. Did not seem nearly as successful as the DEET spray I used.Can anyone tell me what the prevalance of Dengue fever is in July? Thanks much!"
"I don't know anything about Dengue Fever but have traveled with all my infants since 5 months and use the DEET on them anyway. Rather they get a dose of that then a cranky infant with mosquito bites or worse. They are now 11, 9, 3 and 6 months and they all survived a little bit of DEET. JMO (we used the 30% kind)."
There are several articles online - just Google dengue fever puerto vallarta and read up. Rainy season is just getting going though and mosquitos love standing water so . . . I'd probably not take little ones on jungle hikes. Others here will undoubtedly call me a nervous nelly - I tend to follow the better safe than sorry philosophy.
"Thanks! Good to know. Read this article today...mexicogulfreporter.com/2014/02/dengue-fever-…Monday, February 24, 2014Dengue Fever ranking has Jalisco authorities concerned ....The Jalisco secretary of health reports that 143 cases of dengue have been diagnosed since Jan. 1, putting the state in third place nationwide for confirmed instances of the illness. What has officials more worried is that 44 of the cases were of the hemorrhagic type, by far the most serious version and one that can lead to death if not treated promptly and aggressively. They note the year has barely begun, and the rainy season is months away. All of Mexico's 32 jurisdictions report dengue statistics"
"I would use an ""organic"" spray with no DEET. My good friend retired after working 40 years for the ""family company"" that is know for producing the repellent. He absolutely refuses to put any of that stuff on his skin. We use the old skin so soft lotion. Seems to work for us. Enjoy"
"If you are staying in a resort know that they all spray, and the city sprays standing water every rainy season. But use repellent even on the child anyways. You should be doing the same at home also due to West Nile, which is just as troublesome and prevalent. Follow simple rules as well - avoid the aforementioned jungle hikes, also avoid the shoreline at dawn and dusk."
Skin so Soft does nothing for us. We will be there in a few weeks and my little kids will be getting DEET. Hubby hunts and nothing else works for him like that in the bush. I agree with better safe than sorry.Edited: 6 years ago 
"I would also try the bug repellant bracelets, maybe on the baby's ankle? And they sell infant seat bug covers for their little car seats too. Whether you decide to use bug spray or not, these non-chemical options wouldn't hurt. Maybe your doctor would know some natural options, like unscented lotion with peppermint oil or citronella oil which some of my adult friends use and love. No idea if that would safe on a baby though..."
"Thanks for all the advice. In California, West Nile Virus has impacted 3 humans YTD. Dengue fever, in 2 months in the dry season in Jalisco had 143, which is alarming. Maybe I'm too paranoid. However, on tripadvisor last year in Costa Rica, I saw many threads indicating there were busloads of Dengue infected people leaving AI's in the Guanacaste are, which is why it's on my radar. Thanks all for the advice. Would love to use DEET on the little guy, but am scared of the side effects..."
"One of the DE's On this forum could give you a PHd worthy dissertation of the dangers of West Nile in the United States, so I would not dismiss it due to numbers only.While paranoia in small amounts is fine, logic and reason are a much better balance.You're still traveling so clearly it's not as dangerous as you are allowing your imagination to make it, right? (-:Just take your precautions you already planned to, take a deep breath and enjoy your trip."
"I have four small kids, so can totally understand the fears, which is why I've chosen to use the DEET as I think it's the lesser of the two evils. The numbers you have put up are scary, so I get why thinking about West Nile in SoCal is obviously not on your radar like Dengue in PV. We are still traveling too:)Have a great trip and let us know how you liked the VLE. That is one property in Nuevo I have not toured, but have heard great things."
"I peeked at Amazon and they also have very inexpensive bug netting for strollers, playpens and little mobile pop up tents (made from netting) for baby that go anywhere. I think I would also burn citronella candles in the evenings in the room. I think it would be much easier to keep a 3 month old covered than an older baby. I personally would not use the DEET."
"Hii PVjellybean - Yes a little paranoid. I did fend off many family members trepidations about mexico safety, etc... Just didn't even think about Dengue until yesterday, upon remembering CR and what a pain it was to be worried about my then pregnant wife. Thanks for the input and cheers."
"""Dengue concerns me for my newborn, given he cannot have any bugspray with DEET.""On the cans with Deet they usually only recommend spraying clothing, and covering yourself as much as possible with clothing that is tucked into socks and waistband. At least that would limit the amount of exposed skin that is sprayed with bug spray made for Deet free spray made for children. I've also seen advice that you don't have to spray clothing if properly tucked in. Of course you can't dress them like that every day in a tropical environment, but at least for any times near or in the jungle it could be an option. Here's an interesting article I came across the other day, and sent to a forum friend as it's been an issue for her. Some of the tips may be of some help to you. …aol.com/video/…Edited: 6 years ago "
"Well as I sit here, not having a mosquito bite in days, had one a week ago and can't remember any before that. I used raidolito spirals at the house, but just made myself a Mosquito Trap, Google it, and it works great.Out in town - nada ! and all the resorts spray.If I go into the jungle I use the local OFF (which used to be Autan) and is made in Argentina.No need to overreact, ask bzy1, lived here for years without a problem, went to visit family in the USA and got West Nile Virus, which is very nasty !"
"I am looking on my can of bug spray with DEET and nowhere does it say only spray on clothing and cover yourself as much as possible. It even tells how to apply to the face. Maybe it's different here. This was made in Brantford, ON."
"Jill,What is the name brand? We use Deep Woods OFF."
"Thanks all. My OFF does not say spray only on clothing and does read to spray on skin. However, my pediatrician just told my wife to go ahead and use the strong DEET stuff but spray on clothes...???"
Mine is Deep Woods Sportsmen Off. Contains 30% DEET.
"Mine says 25% DEET. Then in huge letters, says: Keep out of the reach of children. Yikes."
"I just went and looked at my dishwashing soap (Sunlight) and it says keep out of reach of children, so does my PAM Olive Oil cooking spray.lol. I'll take my chances."
"Not totally off topic: but if you spray yourself with DEET and go someplace, ie: in the brush, jungle, THE ZOO, and then decide to go on down to Mismaloya for a beach massage (last booth)..... where can you wash this stuff off (before the massage?)Don't say the ocean, lol. I'm not an ocean person. ;) Is there some kind of outside wash off place at the beach in Mismaloya?"
I don't know what would stop you from walking to the Barceló side and using their outdoor shower on the beach. It's not like it's manned or you are going up to their property.
"When a product says""keep out of reach of children"", it is more about the possibility of it being ingested by them. A product like bug spray, suntan lotion and a million other things are perfectly fine if applied correctly.Use common sense with any product that could be misused by children. In other words, applying a little bug spray in areas that can't be licked or touch transferred to a child's mouth will be fine"
"""in 2 months in the dry season in Jalisco had 143,""Jalisco has a population of over 7 million, 143 out of 7 million are pretty goods odds of not catching Dengue Fever. You might be a little paranoid. :)"
"Because we have grandchildren around we have a variety of Cutter products. All Cutter products, including products not containing Deet say ....""Hold can 6-8 inches from skin and clothing while spraying, keeping sprayer pointed away from face. Slightly moisten skin. Use just enough repellent to cover skinand/or clothing. Do NOT use under clothing."" ""When using on children apply to your own hands and then put it on the child."" ------------------------------------Our can of Deep Woods OFF says...""Use just enough repellent to cover exposed skin and/or clothing.""In caps it says ""WORKS ON CLOTHING. Do not use under clothing.""______________________I've sprayed products with Deet under my clothing when I'm doing my spring outside workathons. When I've done that for 2 or 3 days, I get a feeling of being poked with sewing pins very lightly that moves around. They are about 1 a minute. Same thing happens when I just do exposed skin in shorts and clothing for more than a couple days. It goes away after a couple days if I don't use any more Deet.Edited: 6 years ago "
"I'm sure every state/province have different regulations on what must be put on products. Like I said, my PAM Olive Oil cooking spray says keep away from children yet we ingest it and it's meant to be ingested. I wouldn't put too much stock in those ""regulations"" that must be put there due to different laws in different areas for the exact same products.lol.Edited: 6 years ago "
Hey guys... Is it absolutely necessary to wear bug spray to the zoo in December if we go right when it opens?
WE didn't use any in Jan. when we went.
"Just for that balance and logic using the numbers already quoted: 143 cases in the population of Jalisco = 0.002% total.Just use the precautions you planned to and add in the recommendations of areas to be cautious of or avoid, and I think you will do just fine.The well meaning but likely very misinformed friends/family warning about safety are probably a bigger hazard to your trip. (-;"
"So 3 cases of west nile in 38 million (California population) is almost non existent, so not really even worth mentioning here or relevant to the Dengue conversation."
"Bz1 who was referenced as a PV local, mentioned that in 2008 she had 15 people she knew personally come down with Dengue fever, many of them neighbors. I do find Dengue more relevant, especially since many go unreported as there is no cure, and given triple digit increases over recent years.... In any event, sounds like the hotel areas are sprayed and I just need to take a lot of bug spray to keep the little one safe. Looking forward to PV!"
"Jason, I mentioned West Nile specifically because many ignore it and its danger when they shouldn't. The aforementioned bzy1 spent almost 4 months in a US hospital last fall after a visit north to see her family. It can strike as quickly and easily as Dengue so any precautions you would take on holidays in Mexico be sure to do them at home as well. (-: There are always naysayers who think they have it all figured out but it's your family, do what you feel is best for them and enjoy your vacation."
Wow - I hope she is much better. Mosquito's bad! Bug Spray good. Thanks all for the insights.
"For sure look forward to your trip as we are and we will take our little ones and enjoy, but just take precautions for the relevant issues."
"She's doing much better and I send her or bring her bug spray often as I can! LOL I'm sure you will have a great time. Enjoy the summer thunderstorms, great free entertainment."
One thing we always do for our kids is keep their hats wet all the time. Seems to keep them cool when we are sweating:)
"I have spent thousands of hours in the woods and Mosquito infested marshes in Wisconsin USA. I have gotten a sick feeling from using 100% Deet on my skin.So I learned that 100%Deet is So strong that if I use the 100% Deet on my shirt collar and shoes and shorts, it keeps away Mosquito's.So a non toxic spray like skin so soft (non toxic stuff off your choice) on the baby's skin and 100% DEET on the carriage and and baby's shoes and clothes will help.It works for me and I don't get any ill effects from the 100% Deet because it is not on my skin. Don't put 100% Deet on a child or anyones skin. It works. ""Funman""Edited: 6 years ago "
"I may have missed this mentioned in all these posts, but perhaps the OP could ask the baby's pediatrician what they recommend. Yes, dengue is a problem and it only takes one mosquito bite. But that's doesn't mean every mosquito carries dengue. Everyone here has different things that have worked for them, but I would think consulting a doctor regarding the use of pesticides on the baby would be more important than going based on all these differing opinions. Just my opinion of course.Edited: 6 years ago "
"Hey Deb, post 17... his pediatrician told his wife to spray the strong Deet on the baby's clothes. :-)"
"Ok sorry. Reading too fast. Well, I still say, go with what your doctor says."
"All this talk is making me nervous, too. I'm expecting to be in PV with my family soon. I was in PV last year at this time and didn't think much about dengue, though I was aware of it and even talked briefly with someone who'd had it sometime in the past.From what I'm seeing via a search of Google Mexico, there aren't extreme numbers of cases this year, though there are some. Is the city/state taking strong measures these days?"
"Don't overreact, fear of things seems to be the latest thing, calm down, it's really not as bad as it looks.I use the local OFF repellent, but only if I'm doing a serious jungle trek, and I use the cream, much easier to apply.So if you're going to the Botanical Gardens or the Zoo, use it, otherwise don't bother."
"When my kids were really little I never wanted to use a repellant on them. So used to give them a good coat of baby oil and it seemed to deter the mosquitoes. Maybe it blocked their smell, I can't remember where I read the idea but it seemed to work. Maybe if you combined that with spraying the repellant on their clothes in infested areas?? We haven't had much problems with mosquitoes when we were in PV though. I'd also use the nets for their playpens, carseats, strollers etc. Oh yeah for our youngest daughter we had a Peapod baby tent that is totally inclosed in netting. It just pops up and can be used instead of a playpen or crib, it was wonderful."
"I just want to share an observation with you that I haven't been able to explain or figure out. I live in Ontario Canada and I am highly allergic to hornets, mosquitos, fleas etc. I have to carry an epipen and meds with me everywhere I go. I spray myself with Deep Woods Off and I still get bit/stung, if it is more than once I end up in the hospital with the site usually getting infected. I hardly go out in the month of September because of the hornets. You can be sure I am on the menu as the meal of the day. I even cover myself and they get me through my clothes. I have had West-Nile more than once. My most memorable hospital visit was after having lunch at a restaurant on a concrete patio and getting stung 5 times on my butt! hubby is still amused by that one.I have been going to PV for 20+ years - I have walked at dusk and dawn, been on more jungle tours than I can count (wearing deep woods off with 30% Deet on my arms, legs, clothing) - carry the same arsenal of meds and never used it once! I have had 2 mosquitos bites in 20 years and both times I got a tiny dot that was itchy like most other people experience (no meds needed). I have never been stung by a bee or anything else. I don't think I have ever seen a hornet either. I wear shorts, sleeveless T-shirts, sandals.The no-see-ums are a different story. I always spray my ankles with DEET when I am on the beach or sitting with my feet in the sand.Edited: 6 years ago "
"If you are counting on the government of Mexico, Jalisco or Puerto Vallarta to protect you from anything - good luck with that. Take care of yourself and yours as you best see fit. There are locals on here who only paint life here as perfect. But, as with any third world destination, you are ultimately on your own. That includes being be prepared to pay for your own health care should you experience any crisis. Most providers want to see the money up front. I love Vallarta but even though I was born at night, it wasn't last night."
"I travel all over Mexico and I do bring and use 100% deet repellent but do not put it on my skin,only my shorts, shirt sleeves and collar and on my sandals ....clothing si, skin no........."
"Very good carico.""Funman"""
"The city is pretty darn viligent for a city that is NOT in a Third world country. Have you lived in PV during the summer. The city goes door to door inspecting for standing water and passing out chlorine tablets to be dispensed in standing water or anywhere it is known to stand during rain. If you refuse they mark your property as non-compliant. The trucks spray the neighborhoods, the resorts all spray. I was in Houston, Texas in Sept. They had aerial spraying, my son sprayed his entire property, put extra chlorine in his pool and it did absolutely no good at all. Last time I checked the US/Texas isn't a third world country either. Their precautions weren't any different than Puerto Vallarta. It's part of living/vacationing in tropical humid climates. Texas has Dengue fever too along with West Nile Virus.California has out breaks of West Nile virus, they haven't come up with a way of eradicating diseases spread by mosquitos, all they can do is try to keep it under control as much as possible."
"However while PV does a good job of fighting Dengue,the rest cannot be said for the rest of Jalisco.I watch Mexican TV and there was a dengue epidemic in other parts of Jalisco a couple of months ago..Best be prepared with a good bug repellant just in caseEdited: 6 years ago "
"Wonder how many Dengue patrols you have in Colorado, Fred? Of course that's not the tropics, but you do have a 'tick' problem. An occasional visitor is unlikely to notice the Dengue patrols or happen to be on the street when the 'fogging' pick-up comes by.I also dislike the '3rd World' comment, it just shows a lack of knowledge about Mexico."
"It is a concern but I was coming from a Costa Rica trip where they had 39,000 cases of dengue (reported) in a 4m population"
"I think it's a difficult comparison in terms of Mexico to Costa Rica when it comes to how each approaches Dengue. Mexico, especially in the tourism zones, is very diligent and they get more proactive in those areas all the time with their spraying programs and such. Interior Mexico would be another story, so another comparison that should not be made to the coastal tourist heavy zones. I have yet to go to CR but I don't get the impression in any research they have the same level of infrastructure in place within the government there to deal with Dengue in the same fashion (hence the higher numbers of reported cases).I wouldn't use one to compare to the other."
"Okay - Seeing as though I was fine in Costa Rica(much worse). I am fine with the baby and the necessary precautions....Now, for non threatening matters of inconvenience, how does one stop the no see ums? They bight my ancles all the time on the beach!"
"Stay away from the surfline at dawn and dusk as already noted (this is where and when they seem to be most active), and use repellant if you are going to be there.There is no way to completely stop no-see-ums. And some people are just biologically prone to receiving more bites than others, so all you can do is spray and enjoy."
"Jen, do you remember what our legs and elbows looked like after Myself, Shelly and Clare got back from the Botanical Gardens last October? It was evil that day."
"Yes, I remember well. I already have several variations of repellant building on the PV shelf in my home in anticipation of upcoming trips. LOLI'm always researching more too, like citronella oils. Will have to check into that further, but until then I have a MEC store nearby that carries all the high test stuff. (-:I'm not usually a bug magnet in PV (thanking my lucky stars) but I've had a couple of large bites on trips up into the higher altitudes around El Tuito...something took a chunk out of my leg a couple of years ago and I still have the scar. Felt a bit like a horsefly bite.Edited: 6 years ago "
"I have 4 types of bug spray, but nothing higher than 30% DEET. I used to get 100% DEET from the travel medicine clinic but it made me feel ""off"" (bad joke).Going to add some local Off to the arsenal but also have 2 tubes of Afterbite packed.Tequilla applied liberally to the insides dulls the itches, I find. . ."
Mozzies like me. I used to get bit a lot till I started taking Vitamin B12 supplements. I start taking them a week before I go to Mexico then every day while I am there. Seems to work well but I always have back up sprays if im in an area where I know they are waiting for me. I am taking them now as they are out & about in Ontario right now.Edit.. Lol ClaymoreEdited: 6 years ago 
"Not really applicable to visitors, but I made a mosquito trap out of a 2L plastic bottle, some water, sugar and, the important ingredient, yeast. Anyone has a problem at home ? this really works, using it now for 3 weeks and no bites in my house (the trap is outside) https:/…10152439561465942As a Public Service Announcement, I hope nobody hits the ""Report inappropriate content"" button :)"
"People who stay in condos could easily do this on their balcony. Plenty of people go to PV for longer than a couple weeks. So, basically it attracts and kills the mosquitos so they don't come for you, and they can't breed?"
"If you are renting a condo, just bring a Thermacell. They weigh almost nothing, make a whole campsite or deck mosquito free and are inexpensive. No need to make a contraption while on holidays. We use it all the time here and hubby uses it hunting and it works marvelous. It would certainly do a balcony:)"
"We have used those at home since we live in the woods, but I don't think you can bring the cartridges for those on an airplane, so you would have to buy a few in PV. If you spend more than 4 hours or so on your balcony total time, you would have to bring or buy extra mats for them too. : )"
No reason you can't bring them on a plane they aren't liquid or aerosol.
"No, but they are pressurised ! with a flammable gas !"
Not the ones in talking about. They are a soaked sponge....
"If it's thermacell as you said, the soaked part is the mat with deterrent, and they all use a cartridge to release the deterrent."
"Requires heat, which is the cylinder of Butane gas !"
"Are the mosquitoes that extreme in PV right now? In a condo a few floors up close to the beach, would we likely have many to deal with? I like JR's solution that's on the Facebook page if that works."
Not mine. Holding it right now and looking at it. We are bringing it in a few weeks.
"Post an ad for one that only needs a pad, because the Thermacell site doesn't advertise any that operate without a cartridge/cylinder. It's not visible, it's inside a compartment on the unit. There has to be a way to heat up the pad so that it can release the deterrent. Otherwise, maybe whatever you have isn't a Thermacell brand. This could be a solution for Jason's child, or anyone's child if they're going into the jungle areas. In addition to those that sit on a table, they also have some that hang around the waist which I didn't know about. I didn't look to see if they're recommended for hanging on a child though, so double check.edit - megria look it up on the web, I don't know about how high they fly. Supposedly they don't like wind?Edited: 6 years ago "
"A ceiling fan will keep them down to about a foot or so off the floor, they don't do well in a breeze, Many here use Raidolitos spirals which last about 12 hours. But this usually isn't necessary, in any tourist accommodation, like ""In a condo a few floors up close to the beach""Into the jungle, like a visit to the zoo or ziplining, use a repellent :)"
"Kansas, I'm not advertising anything on this site. It will get taken down... They always do. And again, looking at it with no flammable warning, etc. I will post when I get home in a few weeks whether it was a problem or not."
"For others thinking of taking a Thermacell device, this is from their site. Q: Can I bring my ThermaCELL on a passenger airplane when I travel?A: IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations state that you cannot bring ThermaCELL butane cartridges on a passenger aircraft or airline. We typically suggest that you bring your ThermaCELL appliance or lantern, and the mats with you, but purchase the butane cartridges at your destination. Or, you can ship the product to your destination in advance of you arriving. ThermaCELL products are sold in over 25 countries including North America, Europe, Africa, and Australia; and are available throughout the United States and Canada.thermacell.com/mosquito-repellent/…faq"

"I don't know about the USA or Mexico, but there are many different variations of the product here and our's is plane safe (again, no butane and I'm looking at it). I don't know why my post was deleted, but I had 3 pm's telling me to check it out and that the ""group"" had done it again. It is so obvious who it is."
"Since it's so obvious as to who's deleting the posts, why not name names? Constant accusations of ""the group"" (whoever that is) having so much power is getting boring.

"They are free to check mine as well. I have no issues and I just block the people who harass me. I only have 3 blocked and they are all on this forum, but I have sent in all my complaints to TA directly. Also, when everyone was complaining aboutt JR's posts being deleted, all of them were very clear that they knew but would not name names, so call them out too. I recall many of them doing this. Got to call it both ways:)"
"Let's get back to talking about Puerto Vallarta. It's nice to hear about and learn new things. Not the constant drama!! Any more and we'll have to get a soap to sponsor this site and put it on TV in the afternoons. Let's all play nice, or you're all coming in for the day and getting a time out!"
"Going back to topic,Whether you like or dislike JR,I just made one of the home made mosquito traps He posted about and folks,It works,I already caught about a dozen this afternoon with it.It is organic .Having lived in the tropics,I am used to bugs of all types.I have a healthy respect for dengue,because I have had family die of dengue complications and other family hospitalized because of dengue.Personally I will be going to PV with lots of off with 30%DEET as well as making JR s home made mosquito trap.Anybody else out there with experience with the home made trap??/"
"Not 'my' trap, just something I picked up online."
VcrPinoy-I assume you are out of town as you would be hard pressed to find a dozen Mosquitos in Vancouver.
"Correct MOJ,I am on the shore of a lake in the interior of British Columbia.There is nothing much to do,So I decided to build the trap last night.Clarification It was about a dozen bugs not all mosquitoes.JR has provided lots of useful information over the years .Just like bezerk,bzy etc they are residents of Mexico who bring a different perspective to the forum"
MOJ.....that's what I was thinking too.I haven't seen one all year.I think people who stress about mosquito bites tend to attract more......lol
"Vantrader,There might be the odd mosquito hanging around the tropic section of the aquarium.But that being said,I was totally surprised by the number of the bugs .So aside from Deep Woods Off,I got citronella candles and since We had yeast and brown sugar in the cottage kitchen.I decided to make a trap as a lark.i was surprised to see about a dozen assorted bugs by 230 pm"
"Bug Count as of 7am July 7,Caught 19 assorted bugs of which I think 7 are mosquitoes.Note its hot by Canadian standards 31 C here right now"
I wonder if this is a coincidence or if someone read about JR's method here and got it posted at lifehacker.com.lifehacker.com/keep-mosquitoes-at-bay-with-t…
"My mosquito trap had 2 wasps in it plus a bunch of fruit flies, but then it's the burbs of Vancouver. Like everything else I reckon they need a municipal permit to bite you. The bats, swallows and tons of dragon flies take care of ny deck."
"About 3 years ago I made a mosquito trap from a 2 liter bottle for a friends palapa restaurant, he hung it in a corner and forgot about it for a couple weeks, when I returned I asked how his mosquito problem was and got the trap down and there was 4 inches of dead mosquitos inside, unbelievable!"
"I know this is a late post, but I travelled to PV on July 2, 2014 and came down with Dengue Fever 3 - 4 days later. It's a blur as I had two seizures and was hospitalized for 2 days. The doctors in Sayulita were awesome and the clinics very clean. It sucked though, I couldn't walk properly for a month or so after, very weak, couldn't eat etc. It is a horrible situation. Do everything you can to avoid getting Dengue."
"So with all of the recent rain, should we take extra precautions? Arriving on the 22nd."
The strange thing was it has been quite dry for the past two July's when I go to PV/Sayulita but it still happened. I would bring the max repellent that is safe for you.
I got Dengue in July 2014. Hope your family had a good trip with no incidents!
"No recent reports of Dengue here in Puerto Vallarta, don't know about Sayulita, a different area a long way away. Haven't had a daytime mosquito bite for a long time."
"That's what I wanted to hear. Thanks JR! Just so I am clear, the kind of mosquitoes that carry it are only out in the day?Jennifer, were the mosquitoes in Sayulita, or in PV? We will be sticking to PV proper, as we enjoy exploring the various restaurants, bars, and of course, shopping areas. I could definitely see how some of the outlying areas may be more suspect due to lack of spraying/foilage/standing water. We will be careful. Thanks for sharing your experience."
"July = warmer, humid, rainier. More likely to experience insect activity in this monthFebruary = drier, cooler, not as humid. While insects will still be out, there will be LESS standing water to attract mosquitos (other than probably tinacos LOL).Take repellant but I wouldn't be paranoid about Dengue being a huge epidemic problem at this time of year."
"Use repellent...have not heard of any issues with dengue thus far this year. There may be standing water though , more so than other years as has been a much wetter ( rainy ) winter than usual."
Hi Pinnacle 8850- it was in Sayulita. There weren't swarms of mosquitos around either. My bad luck! I hope everything goes well.
"Our friend got Dengue Fever last November, most likely from our trip to the Botanic Gardens. We all used the bug lotion they sold at the entrance. Everyone gots lots of bites except me, for some reason. Our friend was diagnosed with DF by her US doctor. So, Dengue Fever does occur around PV - at least last Fall. We are off to Belize and Guatemala and we have our Deet.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Yes there are some cases here but it's not epidemic, the usual amount of cases."
"Dengue has been steadily increasing in prevalency however, globally- and mosquitoes carrying it have been found in more and more areas of the world where they never have been before.After my husband contracted it in Mexico (east coast) in September, DEET sprays will be a regularly packed item, year round, for all future trips. It is nasty."
"In case anyone is interested in knowing more about Dengue- this is a helpful article: plus it has a good photo of the type of Mosquito that can transmit the disease.http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/dengue-transmission-22399758 Remember the mosquito has to bite an infected person first before it can transmit the virus... In over 12 years, I have never had Dengue...but, I did have West Nile Virus Encephalitis from a mosquito that bit an infected horse and then bit me... In Minneapolis at the end of September! So go figure :)"
"and that particular mosquito only bites during the day, not at night. I might add that I haven't had a bite in a long time. :)Edited: 5 years ago "
We haven't had any mosquitoes in months but the Secreteria de Salud has been by a few times depositing tablets for any standing water.
