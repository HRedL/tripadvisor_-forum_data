We are waiting to rebook. Sadly had to cancel our June vacation and will wait to see the protocols. But yes we are anxious to return. Be safe.
"Seriously Dr. Jim.....wow, that’s truly unbelievable."
"beyondtci...Couldn't agree more. This link was sent to ""stakeholders "" by the Ministry of Health (MoH) earlier today and just after the Premier's speech. https://www.gov.tc/moh/coronavirus/guidance and is the guidelines referred to in the Premier's speech. A hard copy of her speech is now up https:/…I have no idea what the ""local interpretation"" of the guidelines is but like the other 30 odd people in the email chain I hope to find out shortly. I wholly agree it might be prudent to get clarification on the quarantine period if any prior to booking any flights."
"I personally would guess, travel will involve some form of ;1) pre test certificate in order to fly2) mandatory 72hr - 5 day quarantine once on island (in your villa / resort)3) possible re-testing while on island4) records of your movements / interaction required5) repatriation insurance mandatory (if ill)6) limited rental cars available for the island7) no back to back bookings for rooms, villas etc"
Your predictions are similar to current ones in St. Lucia and Bahamas. Hopefully premier will lay out details in next 2 weeks and not wait until July!
Quarantine period is clearly stated as 2 weeks. What’s the point of visiting if we have to stay inside for 2 weeks
"I missed that. Where does it state the quarantine period will be two weeks for tourists? Not sure it matters though. Even 72 hours is longer than I'd agree to pay to be quarantined, if it meant not being able to use the amenities or beach. Villa quarantine might be OK, if on the beach, although not sure I'd be comfortable at a villa with the current safety concerns."
"https:/…25-travel-to-tciThis may or may not change in the coming weeks but as of this writing is the ""latest"" from the Ministry of HealthEdited: 4:15 pm, May 30, 2020 "
"We decided to change our hotel reservations to next June. We were offered a free night on top of our already 33% discounted price. If I was already booked for August or later, I would have kept it."
"Happy, help me out here, i have read and re read this thing you have posted a number of times. The list certainly doesn't look very accurate and if one is from at least USA or Canada you are in the clear. Am totally misreading this?"
"You have the Tourist Board saying ""we're open 22 July"" You have the Ministry of Health saying that if you are from the US, UK or Canada you can come but will be asked to quarantine 14 days. If you have been to any of the listed countries in the last 21 days you are prohibited entry. Like beyondtci (the OP) said listen to the Premier who hopefully will offer clarification on this and other matters. The Premier has been referring back to the MoH and it's guidelines. Hopefully there will be further information on this but it won't happen until next week at a minimum. Not trying to be alarmist or defeatist but I don't think the concept of a quarantine on arrival is being considered. I have no idea how they would enforce it either. But as it stands now the guidelines reflect a perhaps voluntary quarantine of 14 days. I live in Maine and we have a 2 week quarantine in place for anyone coming into the State from away but it doesn't seem like anyone is obeying it based on all the out of State plates at the supermarket.Edited: 4:55 pm, May 30, 2020 "
"The premier is the ONLY sourceJust my opinion, (to be clear) but I read it as they’re not going to quarantine guests. You can’t. Really these are outsiders. Anything written (including my opinion) is only speculation, that until the premier lays it out, all other posts, are just interpreting, guessing, speculating."
"No one really knows. Expedited dates have not been released for international arrivals into PLS. Move on. Whole world out there. Enjoy your travels. Other countries are opening up and great places to holiday at. Just pay attention on traveling via aircraft ... could be a downer? As always, could be costlier but if $$ are no issue, go to the Mediterranean (opening up). Crime growing on Provo. Read tci weekly.com"

Numbers is obsessed with crime just not in her own area. Only with Provo.

"DaveC: Yes, crime and family security info is necessary."
"HappyBubbles, thanks for the info and link. Who knows what will happen until the Premier updates everyone."
"Numbers, I was not picking on you, I was pointing out that you keep repeating the same comments no matter what the topic is.So rather than making a contribution no matter how big or small (my contributions tend to be very small indeed) you just refer to things that you do not likeEvery post does not have to refer to you or everyone else’s dollar , but it’s does get tiresome when you repeat it over and over"
"Numbers if everything is documented for everyone's review, why are you continually polluting this forum with it? Why if you are traveling all of the world do you not have any other forum that you post to? Why are you so consumed with money and crime on this forum? Transparency please."
"Well if you look back to her many posts , again not picking on Numbers but she has said she lost a pile of money at the casino.Maybe that’s the issue? Who knows"
"DaveC: If I ever wrote lost $$ at Casablanca .... total error. I usually win at the slot machines there. What a cute little casino. Get treated very well there.Sorry, fake news. Cannot find the post."
"<< ""I usually win at the slot machines there."" >>Statistically improbable. Sounds like a case of ""gambler's memory"" to me.:-)"
"You wrote it and then deleted it, of course maybe I am confused. Apologies."

#27 How are your posts in anyway on topic here?
"Just want to bump the OP. Plans to open are NOT finalized yet. As of yesterday the Premier was asked on a radio programme about testing prior to entry into the Country and quarantines. She replied there will be a decision made closer to the date. the Health Minister said the same thing. So PLEASE listen to the Premier, the Governor and the Health Minister making decisions unless you are will to go along with whatever plans as yet announced may be. Thanks to the OP, beyondtci for his post. beyondtci wrote : ""Before anyone starts booking flights and packing bags, based on Facebook, TA and other forums..Please get the latest from the Premiers / Governors Office AND ONLY THEM.Even some associated Govt Depts have been know to put out ""incorrect"" info, so be sure to get it from the source only.I see in all these posts, only Blamona has constantly reiterated this, for good reason, thats the only source.Yes we are ""open"" 22 July but the Devil is in the Detail (aka quarantine protocols) and they have NOT been announced yet.I posted recently it would be end of July for the airports, (not too far wrong) so heed this..We need the protocols in place, before are fully up and running, and that will come down to the tiniest of details even like the correct TYPE of mask you have...Stay safe x"""
