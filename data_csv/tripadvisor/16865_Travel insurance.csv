"Could anyone recommend an international travel insurance that would cover us (family 2+2 from Cyprus) on our planned trip to USA?We have a local insurance which does not cover cancellation ""for any reason"", luggage insurance is only 200â‚¬ and medical cover is not great either.I'd like to make an insurance that could cover us in case of hurricane, airline cancellation and possibly on cancellation of the whole trip (due to covid - Cyprus has no cases yet but we will be visiting NYC, Me and Fl where there were cases reported)I tried googling but a mind boggling number of results come up and I would like to research those that at least are tried and recommended by TA community.Many thanks"
"Aren't these usually specific to the country from which you reside? We could give you recommendations if you were based in the U.S., but not sure any of those carriers would cover you from your country."
Ask on the Air Travel forum - this isn't really a question about Orlando.
You might want to contact an insurance broker in Cyprus for the type of policy you require.

"insuremytrip.com does at least have the ABILITY for you to search for coverage as a citizen of Cyprus. After that, you would have to do your own due diligence as to whether any of the policies suggested are suitable or not."
"Besides Insuremytrip, Squaremouth is the other website I use to look at options. For what you want, you would likely need to buy ""cancel for any reasons"" coverage. In my experience, you have to buy that coverage within like 30 days of a first payment."
