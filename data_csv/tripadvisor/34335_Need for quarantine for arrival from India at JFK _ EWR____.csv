(Also posted on NYC forum)HiWe are Indian citizens planning to arrive at JFK / EWR on a flight from Mumbai. The flight may be non stop (United) or one stop (LH via FRA or BA via LHR).I am trying to find out whether there is a 14 day quarantine need for travelers from India? This seems to be required for travelers from Schengen / China..... but India is not on the list.Travel is mid Sept --- pl also advise the correct website to check this ever changing criteria. I tried cdc.gov but was unable to find the answers........Thanks in advance...
At this point in time India is not on a restricted list so no quarantine required.
The flight may be non stop (United) or one stop (LH via FRA or BA via LHR). - Note that under the current restrictions that you will not be allowed entry to the USA if you are flying from FRA or LHR
Here are some more information: https:/…from-other-countries.html
TomC97 - even if we are in transit area at FRA / LHR ? We would take United only if no other option - as we are not fans of these 16 hr flights....... but looks like we may not have a choice..
"Lenny - the website link given by Dubai_Phil_R shows the list of countries and any person who has been in any of these countries is simply NOT allowed to enter the USA at all.My question is - since I am allowed to enter the US from India (say the direct non stop flight) - do I then still need to quarantine / isolate ? ---- this still is not clear...... Especially since people going to NYC say from Dallas, TX still need to quarantine / isolate..."
Wasn't this covered in your other thread?
"""even if we are in transit area at FRA / LHR ?""Yes, even if you are in transit. For the purposes of the US entry restrictions, transit in a restricted country counts as a presence in that country in the last 14 days. You will need to go either nonstop or transit in a country not on the restricted list."
"Actually I'm baffled as to why, when US citizens are warned against ant travel to India due to Covid-19 (Level 3- No Non-essential travel ) and a Level 4 (due to Civil unrest and Terrorism), that people coming to the US from India should not be required to do a 14-day self-quarantine. As has been pointed out, those transiting in Europe, in a country on the restricted list, have to quarantine, as do people traveling from other US States going to places like NY, NJ, and CT (to name a few). Makes no sense. We have enough problems controlling the cases we have here now without additional cases coming in from overseas, directly or indirectly."
"I'm baffled...If and when you do find out the reasoning behind the US response to the virus, maybe you can enlighten me."
"ThanksSS, I'm afraid we will all be a longtime - if ever - figuring out US policy on Covid-19."
"Do you have a visa? Don't you have to have a valid visa (maybe a B2?)to enter US from India, even as tourist? My understanding is US embassy and consulates in India have reopened for visa issues, but currently only for people in urgent need of visas to come for study, academic exchange, or emergency. So I assume you got your visa before COVID issues arose? I suggest you contact US consulate nearest you to find out if that visa has been in any way affected by recent developments.I think in some cases even though certain countries aren't on any of our official lists, our government is dealing with issue by simply not issuing visas.Edited: 9:03 pm, August 19, 2020 "
"We already have a 10 year B-1/B-2 visa, valid to June 2023....."
"This is a similar thread that I almost commented on- the exact same sentiment/question as OP is asking.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10…In that thread OP, after getting the opinions, is asking his parents to consider a direct flight since a stopover at UK would not allow them to enter the US. I found the same thread that Phil Dubai posted and it did not mention India. Which is strange considering that it is #3 on the list of most covid cases. So I did not post my remark.Valid question by OP since I can drive to Delaware from NY in 2 hours and I have to self quarantine for 14 days upon returning home. And Delaware was just added to NY's list I believe 3 days ago."
"It is confusing. That is one of the many reasons that people should not be traveling to the U.S., unless there is an urgent need and it is essential.There is no single website that can give you all that you need to know, because the rules and restrictions are implemented by different governments agencies, You have one group of government agencies that coordinate their rules about people crossing our borders. You have another group of State governments that deal with risks posed by people moving between States. Each State decide who can come into their state without quarantine. These rules and restriction are constantly reviewed and adjusted to control the risk based on the current trend. You can research the best you can now, but those rules and restrictions may be different by the time you actually travel. You just need to be aware of that possibility.Right now, our preference is that no one travels so that we can contain the spread of the virus."
