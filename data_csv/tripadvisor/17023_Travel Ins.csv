Will our travel insurance be canceled if we decide to stay in Los Cabos during Coronavirus epidemic?

No...Your insurance will not be canceled...BUT pre existing issues and COVID19 might not be covered. Read your policy and contact the provider for your coverage. All policy are different!
"Agree with Rocky, definitely check your insurance coverage because they are all different."
"You need to contact the provider instead of asking on this forum. It's highly unlikely anyone on here would have the correct information for you. The policy is for specific dates, so keep that in mind as well."
