Hi We are planning a trip to Baiersbronn in early October? Is the problem with ticks still a concern at that time of the year? Many thanks
"Depends a bit on weather and temperatures, but ticks can still be active in October, yes."
"And it isn't so much that ticks can be a problem in general, it is that a bite from a single infected tick which isn't treated quickly can give you serious long term health problems. In a way, there is less of a problem in October than in the summer because wearing adequate clothing is easier, be warned though that ticks can bite through clothes so loose clothing is better than skin-hugging gear."
Isn't the likelihood of being bitten by a tick in a Baiersbronn high end restaurant as low or high as being bitten by a poisonous snake in Perth's CBD?
Every year there are several hundred cases of TBE in Germany as well as tens of thousands cases of Lyme disease ( borreliosis) so it does not hurt to be careful. Avoid walking through high grass and search your body regularly.
"Ingrid, change this to ""poisonous spider"" and I'd say, yes it is. (Our hosts in Perth made me jump when we asked them about redback spiders and they pointed to the sink on their terrace, centimetres from my chair.) Ticks occur in gardens by the houses, too. However - a bit of caution yes, panic no. The risk is highest if you leave the paths and walk through grass and push through low plants and shrubs. Ticks sit on the plants and wait to be brushed off by a passing warm-blooded creature. As opposed to widespread rumours, they do not drop from the trees. If you stay on wider paths the chance to catch a tick is minimal."
"is there an unusual epidemic of ticks in baiersbronn? i thought that they could be found anywhere in long grass and that you just take normal precautions? must work, because i have never been bitten by one........"
"Anyway, if you are bitten by a tick, preferably have it removed by a doctor, or remove it yourself but very, very carefully, without hurting it or scaring it. For if you do, it will spew it's stomach content into the wound, and that is where the bacteria may be. There are two diseases that can be transmitted by ticks. One is FSME for which there is a vaccination. The other one is lyme disease. No vaccination. If you have been bitten, just watch the bite site, and if anything is out of the ordinary (swelling, pain, red concentric circles forming around the bite site), you're in for a course of antibiotics that will last several weeks. My physician told me that you'd not take antibiotics just because you have been bitten. You'd see whether any of the first symptoms appear. Just my two cents. Speaking from Bavaria here, and the ticks in our forests are also infectious. The caught me twice!"
"As we live here for our whole life till now and never where bitten, it cannot be so dangereous.We go hiking every summer.Besides not strolling through high gras with short pants, or going through thick bush, you should examine your body after a hike and if there is a tick remove it carefully. So normal precaution will be enough.Beate"
"""Anyway, if you are bitten by a tick, preferably have it removed by a doctor""I am not an expert, but I have read different advice: to remove the tick as soon as you discover it, instead of taking the time to go to a doctor. There are (cheap) tools for tick removal; I carry a credit-card sized one with me when hiking.By the way, even if a tick bites, it does not mean that it transfers a disease. But by removing the tick quickly, you reduce the risk even further. (The numbers I have found are: a bit less than 1% chance of catching TBE and something like 5% for lyme disease if bitten by a tick.)"
Agree with GermanSW: remove it as soon as you see it. It takes a few hours for them to release the viren or bazilles.
"In addition to the things mentioned above, risk can be reduced by using tick repellent sprays (ask in a local drug store chain) and searching your body for ticks after being outside."
