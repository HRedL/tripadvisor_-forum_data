"Be sure to bring pepper spray as neglected dogs have been biting people on one of the beaches. Sadly, due to careless owners, it's come to this."
Isnt pepper spray illegal?And it sorta would have been important to mention which one of the beaches you are talking aboutEdited: 3 years ago 
Ao Yai middle beach. Three separate attacks last week.
Overeheard a guy the other day complaining he was bitten at night on long beach...
I was there in December and I don't recall seeing any dogs. There used to be a German vet who organized getting them rounded up and sterilized every year. Maybe she no longer comes.
Packs of dogs near Sun Resort and on Long beach. Territorial fighting and if you get caught up in between they will go for you. Day time and nightime. Was ther Jan 22 - 26th. 17.
"I was there March 2017, there were many reports of dog attacks on Ao Yai and some on Ao Khao Kwai. It was not territorial fighting they were deliberately attacking people randomly. People advised to carry large stick at night, decided to leave after a close skirmish one night. Went to neighboring Koh Chang where there was no problem."
"Just visited both Phayam and Chang Noi and found the dogs on the main beach on Chang to be much worse than on the beaches on Phayam. Barking and running up to you in groups of 3 or 4 and snarling/lunging towards you. None tried to bite but I think if you were jogging with earphones in or if you had small children, you'd want to be paying close attention to your surroundings."
We will not be visiting this Island then.No one in Thailand cares about dealing with these kinds of issues.
"""No one in Thailand cares about dealing with these kinds of issues"" Really absolutely no one. I think that you may well find that there are far more caring people than you give credit for."
in bang ben beach 46km. south of ranong town NO DOGS at all [moslim town] here have a long beach with mangroves and unspoiled islands.
"Bang Ben Beach = National park = no residents = no irresponsible dog owners dumping dogs on the sois, reproducing = no dog issuesNo dogs at our swimmer's beach either, but on a military base, well, except our dog, as somehow I missed that sign.......oops, along with the no chairs sign.......the Ugly American. Have to leave them both home next time, though we sit at far end of beach, less to no people, and 'safety patrol' did walk by and didn't say anything or give us ugly face, as quite pleasant chaps. Next time..........and that was a big sign that I walked right pass, didn't notice till leaving.... LOL Though nothing said at entry gate either, and hard to miss dog sitting on my lap.....so not really enforced.......but I prefer not to be the Ugly American. Good movie to rent.Edited: 3 years ago "
"There are people who care for dogs in Thailand, but Thailand has a huge problem with stray dogs, including in some areas rabies. Most of the soi and stray dogs are very poorly cared for, and to top it off Westerners, who should know better, feeding them, including from restaurant tables, which leds to yet more unwanted dogs roaming the streets.Last night I witnessed a Thai motorbike driver unable to avoid hitting a stray dog in the road, dog killed, Thai man seriously injured. Thailand has millions of stray dogs which create numerous problems."
"I saw the same thing looking out of the window of a bus. 2 people on a motorbike, driving carefully, about 40kmh, dog ran out and they hit it, they both came off and I guess must have suffered some injuries though I don't think serious, but the dog seemed to be okay."
Could anyone who is currently on Ko Phayam update about the situation this year?The tourist high season should be starting now. Would be interesting to know wether the problem is persistent or even getting worse.With many families visiting Ko Phayam the guesthouse and restaurant owners should be interested to improve the situation. Are there less tourists than usual this season?
"When it comes to dogs, usually doesn't get better with time, as their numbers simply multiply with time.Good Luck"
That's why I am asking for first hand information from somebody who is actually staying on the island just now.
I’ve been on Koh Phayam on Ao Yai twice in the last two years and stray dogs were not an issue at all.I didn’t go this time because the weather is too rainy.Edited: 2 years ago 
"I've just got back from five days on Phayam. I was staying in middle of the island and so I had to walk back from the beaches at sunset or early evening. After dark, I was quite scared as several groups of 3-4 dogs came out snarling and growling. It seems that they spend the day barking at each other and then at night ""team up"". I had to swing my bag at one group of three or hang back and wait until motorbikes went passed which caused them to back away from the road. They weren't all stray dogs: often the restaurant/shop owners came out to yell at their growling dogs. It wasn't very pleasant.I was also woken up one night by howling."
"They can still be stray even if people in nearby restaurants have some control over them. The dogs stay in the same territory every day so the people living and working nearby come to know them. Maybe they give them food occasionally so the dogs do what they say, but they aren't really owned by anybody. You can call them community dogs; where the people living on the same road take care of them but nobody really owns them.On some seasonal islands where everybody leaves the island after high season this can be a problem as nobody feeds the dogs and they become more aggressive."
"Well, pet or stray, what I witnessed on a daily basis was aggressive enough for it to be a problem for tourists - especially those taking children. I have come across several posts from 2017 - mainly in guesthouse reviews - describing tourists being bitten whilst walking home from dinner in the evening. It is something people heading there for the first time, or the first time in years, need to take into consideration,"
"Dog attacks in Ko Phayam, and news of a Rabies epidemic in Thailand. No thank s"
"Pepperspray???? i spent 1 week in Koh phayam and yes there are many straydogs and NO, none of them show any signs of aggression. Dogs can sense if you have good or bad intentions, guess what they sensed with you, ""Mr pepperspray"""
If you are jogging a lot of dogs will want to chase you/bite your ankles. Most joggers don't have bad intentions.
"Sad not to hear any positive stories about the dogs of Koh Phayam here. We visited the island this summer and the dogs of long beach were the highlight of our visit! They befriended us on the first day and stuck with us for the whole time, going for walks up and down the beach and sitting with us at our bungalow. It was a privilege to be welcomed into their little world, and touching to see how friendly and desperate for a bit of affection they were. It's also heartbreaking to see how bedraggled some of them were - skeletal thin and plagued by ticks. Whenever I go back I will be sure to bring some front line or advocate anti parasite medication, and I urge anyone else visiting to do as well. You can buy dog biscuits in some of the little shops in the main town. Make sure to distribute it evenly so as not to provoke fights between them. In the end these animals are just suffering from neglect.If everyone who visited put in a little effort it would improve the lives and condition of these animals immensely. Obviously it's important to be cautious and respectful of any dog, pet or stray alike. Never approach a dog that's growling, has its ears back, or is ominously quiet. And if a dog comes barking at you just walk away quickly and confidently. These principles are as true in the west as they are on a beach in Thailand.But on the whole the Koh Phayam dogs are much friendlier than most pets you'll meet. If you show them just a little kindness they will become your best friends!"
"Just off of Koh Phayam after 10 days. Visited all areas of the island day and night and have had a very different experience to that of the OP and others. The dogs were all either completely nonchalant and didn’t care that you were there whatsoever or they were really friendly. There was a bit of barking and howling occasionally when dogs went into others territories. But nothing that kept you up at night. Dog fights between territories were occasional, and I can see how you could accidentally get caught up in one. However actively seeking out an attack on humans seems really odd. The dogs didn’t generally come near us most of the time, except for a few that wanted some love. Didn’t even really scrounge for food. Most of them appeared to be pets and were of good health and condition. A lot of them had been neutered and there were only a few puppies here and there that we spotted. Didn’t hear of one attack on humans whilst I was there. Speaking with one of the guesthouse owners, I was told that a vet had gone through and neutered the entire island (well, most anyway!) in 2017 and that had calmed things down a lot. I did see the odd few dogs that were entire, but that was infrequent. So it appears that for the time being, everything has mostly calmed down and there is less risk of being bitten. I wouldn’t let it put you off going there unless you have a general fear of dogs. There are a LOT of them! Which we loved!"
"Lots of dogs on buffalo bay, just as quiet as us tourist. Never felt any danger, they seem used to people and either ignore us or give us a look when we pass by to check if we’ve got anything to say. I was expecting some bad encounters but my worry seemed totally unjustified."
"I am currently on Koh Phayam and had read this post before coming so was aware of the potential dog problem. Fortunately I believe the situation has changed somewhat over the last 2 years. There has been a mass sterilization project undertaken by the not for profit organization ‘All for Villages’. This has obviously been highly successful as from what we have seen most dogs, whilst some may be homeless, in general they seem to be healthy and well fed looking. Obviously not all, but I have to say the vast majority look good. We have not encountered any aggressive dogs at all. Well done to the California based allforvillages.org.Edited: 8:39 pm, September 26, 2019 "
"1 and 2 post wonders, starting and feeding a thread..........hard to believe, as when there, didn't take notice to any problem dogs."
an account with 47 reviews is hardly 'fishy'.
"The intent of the origianl post was to shed some light on the dog situation. In the past two years, since the post, things look as if they've changed. The Thai army did come two years ago and they took away one of the ""ring leader"" dogs. Hopefully this thread can die a painless death and people can get on with other things."
Is Bang Ben a reasonable place to stay. The reason I ask is that I have passed it several times on the main road and wondered what it was like and whether there were any downsides to it?
