"I have only been to Vegas twice so I don't know if this is at all hotels, but neither had a vent in the bathroom or coffemaker, what's up with that?!"
They want you in the Casino! The rest comes under the heading TMI!
(Picture Al Bundy with his newspaper!)
This is a question of great importance. I believe I will take the rest of the day off to ponder the possiblities.
no coffeemaker = less time spent in the roomVent in the bathroom = extra money
"I really never gave the vent thing a thought since I don't room with anyone but the coffeemaker thing bothers me. It seems like if you want a coffeemaker you will need to stay off strip. The Coast casinos now have them and I was pleasantly surprised when I stayed at the 4Queens last week they also have in room coffeemakers. With the prices these strip hotels charge, you would think they would at least throw in a coffeemaker since you're throwing all your money in their machines."
It's just that you'd think they would AT LEAST have a vent in the bathroom.... lots of people room with friends in Vegas and it would be nice to have some privacy! It's not like the hotels are hurting for money.
It's not just in Vegas where there is a lack of ventilation in the bathrooms. It's an epidemic! I've been forced to use a public rest room in order to save embarrassment or asphyxiating loved ones!
Okay Lon- way too much information. :)
"""you would think they would at least throw in a coffeemaker since you're throwing all your money in their machines.""Part of the reason you're throwing all that money in is because (unless you have room service) you have to leave your room and go downstairs to get a coffee and they hope you'll gamble en route. They want you in the casino area, not hanging in your room drinking coffee!"
"OK Lonsouth.....I just spit coffee all over my desk!!!!!!!! LOL!!!! =)TXVgirl....I have wondered the same thing...and I'm sitting here trying to remember, because I know I have stayed at least one place where the vent DOES work and they have them.....Golden Nugget maybe? Pretty much all of the places I've stayed on the strip don't have them....but they do have the little vent cut out if you notice, just not the fan part. "
"LOL, Lonsouth!! I WISH my DH was that nice. He seems to always use the bathroom right before I take a shower or am about to get ready! I ended up using the public restrooms so my friend wouldn't suffer that night I was having trouble. Sorry to all the people in the public restroom! "
"While many bathrooms in Vegas don't have ""fans"" (and that is not a pun)....Almost all have ""vents"". Just look for the small grate on the wall.It opens into an interior airshaft shared by bathrooms all up and down that ""spine"" of the hotel. Sometimes there is a positive ventilation system (i.e. a fan at the bottom of the airshaft pushing air up through it, or one at the top pulling air out) and in other hotels it works solely on convection.It is because of this open shaft connecting the vents that you can smell someone smoking (or other odiforous activity) and often noise coming from another room.They are not the best or most efficient methods of ventilation , but better than nothing, and required to allow the humidity created by the shower to escape (otherwise all the bathrooms in Vegas would be moldy)."
"Actually, Gold Coast, Orleans and I believe South Point all have coffee makers and bathroomes with windows that open to the outside. The ElCo tower rooms have the window, but no coffee. In fact, all 4 places are strangly similar with regard to room design. I guess it's a Gaughn thing."
"How do you know when you're staying in a one star hotel?When you call the front desk and say, ""I got a leak in my sink,"" and the clerk replies, ""Go ahead."" LMAO!!!!!!! "
"Barbary Coast/Bill's has a small window in the bathroom that opens, just a small piece of useless info!"

OK... waaaaaaaaaaaay too much info.
First off Yes ALL the bathrooms have a vent you just did not see it. Second most of the rooms I get have a coffee maker but I get better rooms than most. That being said here is my commentDon't need a coffee maker in the room because the call of the casino wakes me up!Don't need a vent in the bathroom because while in Vegas my stuff don't stink! If is do I am too drunk to smell it!Discuss!
"Re-Vent:It is also nice to have a vent with a fan to help clear the steam following a shower if you want to use the mirror to shave...many men do, myself included. It seems many bathrooms w/o fans take forever to clear the mirror...and toweling it isn't the same...While we are on the subject why don't hotels have one ro two good sized hooks inthe room where it would be convenient to hang a garmemt bag? Many have closets but bags, when hung there are harder to reach and soem can't hang all the way...Ok my vent, uh rant, is over... "
lol Lon and others...this came under my first post of TMI!!!!!
"OK- so I am on my lunch, I run home and of course I need to see what important topics are being discussed-this IS important to me and DH and I have our own solution (to the vent problem anyway)- if either of us are showering there is really no reason to have the door firmly closed so the steam isnt an issue- HOWEVER-as privacy is very important to us for OTHER bathroom uses, I always pack a very small dispenser of OUST -it is a plastic receptacle that has a replaceable aerosol cannister (about a half ounce) that snaps into it- you just press down and VOILA!! great smell instead of anything unpleasant! I have been bringing this with us since it came out on the market- works for us!  You could also make a quick trip to the local CVS in Vegas-I'm sure they have room freshners there and you could even be nice and leave it behind for the next guest -$1.39 investment isn't too bad.As for the coffeemaker.... since we only drink ""old fashioned perked on the stove at home I wouldn't be happy with a drip maker anyway-so we just make do with the coffee offered down the hall at the concierge club first thing in the morning-not too bad.Jan"
OMG! The one star joke is the best! I laughed out loud and my boss wanted to know what was so funny?? So I read her the joke. We are both laughing!
"For those having problems with the fogged mirror, don't try toweling it. Pull out the hair dryer and use that to dry it.Camille"

"The best advice I ever heard for the mirrors is to take some shaving cream and wipe the mirror with it. Then just dry it with a paper towel. It will not fog up during a shower. Don't laugh! I'm not kidding. It really works. But for some reason, it seems like it needs to be the foamy stuff. Not the gel. And if you get the scented shaving cream, you'll have a cure to the other problem. I can't wait until tomorrow to hear how many people put shaving cream on their mirrors tonight or tomorrow morning!!! "
"""Pull out the hair dryer and use that to dry it.""I am follically challenged...what's a hair dryer?""Take some shaving cream and wipe the mirror with it. Then just dry it with a paper towel. It will not fog up during a shower.""My, my, my what you don't learn at TA....BTW: Cracking the door during showering would work but my GF sleeps later than me and being the nice, considerate guy that I am I try to be very quiet....shhhhhh"
Myshi??Are you the same one on the Playa Del Carmen board?? 
"LoisThe vent is easy, it's probably just a question of how the ventalation sysem is set up.Coffeemaker, some rooms have them and some don't. It also depends on the type of room.You would think that all the best hotels would have one and the lower class joints would not but it is suprisingly mixed. I know that there is a list of the have and have nots somewhere out hereI have been told that it is a health department question requiring the unit to be washed and sanitized in accordance with ""restruarant"" type rules.I have also been told that it is a fire risk.For instance the Golden Nugget had not coffee pot in the standard rooms and I got both answers when I asked why not, yet a suite on my floor had a full kitchen.The answer ""so you will leave the room"" is as good an answer as any. We bring a cheap coffee pot with us when we go for more than a few days and we know we are staying in a no coffee pot hotel. Or you can bring some coffee and filters etc. and get one for $10.00 at Walgreens and just leave it behind.Some other things that vary from hotel to hotelIron and ironing boardIn room safeIn room fridgePlasma TVThese are listed by the hotel under ""amenties""."
"Hey Snowflake!!! Yep, it's me. I've been lurking here for a while now. PDC was great but Vegas is calling me back. We got married out there a few years back and I just can't stop thinking about going back. "
"Myshi, SnowflakeDid you notice we were three yoopers posting in a row?What are the odds?24"
"I noticed. I was showing my co-worker how TA works, and there we were. Odds? I hope they're that good when I'm in LV."
Not that I'm not working though!!!
I envy those that can worry about needing a vent in the bathroom while on vacation.
"as to vents in hotels...alot besides Vegas don't have vents, carry air freshner in pump...or matches :)Why would you want to get rid of the steam? its the only time I get any moisture in Vegas. I turn on the shower just to add some humidity in the room.Coffe makers in a room are nice, but alot of people use them for other things then coffee, so instead of disinfecting them, they don't offer them. And if you don't have imagination as to what they are used for, think about overdrinking, and someone else already has the ice bucket.can't put a plastic bag in the coffe stein.yuck"
Bountiful rich food. Beer by the gallon...and no fans in the bathrooms.Makes for a very romantic environment for a couple

"This seems simple IMHO.No coffee makers, gets you up and out of the room early.Poor or no bathroom venting, gets you out of the room in a hurry.Different techniques,same result."
I'd rather have thin walls than doors that throw me across the hallway.p.s.Watch your head in the shower.
"LOL, omarthetentmaker. Everyone don't forget to read my TR please, I have been working so very hard on it..."
"I've also heard that the coffee makers pose a fire hazard. I know, doesn't seem to be an issue anywhere except Vegas, but I think I read that as one of the QOTD on lasvegasadvisor."
"There are a few QODs on coffemakers. You would have to do a trial membership to see them. The gist of it is that hotels don't like to have coffeemakers because the carafes have to go through the dishwasher instead of washed in the sink but I think the one cup makers solve that for them. The other reason is more pratical: no one else does it so why should I?I don't drink coffee so I couldn't careless if they are available. However, since its that important to folks, I would work Harrah's over on it. They already provide some for premier players and they can be more responsive to customer demands. If Harrah's does it, MGM will have to respond. Just my 2 cents. "
"Hey 24Fan I did not notice! That is cool. I love Marquette. We are over there a few times a year.Back to the topic, I think we even have bathroom vents here in the UP?? I gues we are not as behind on the times as all the downstaters think! Ha Ha"
Almost every hotel in most cities have coffee makers except VegasThey want you in the casinos walking buy slots on your way to get coffee
