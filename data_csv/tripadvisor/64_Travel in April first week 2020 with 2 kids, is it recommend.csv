"Hello,I have booked everything for all of us. I will now with the coronavirus issue, but am not sure whether we should go or not. Folks who have visited, and can you shower some insight on coronavirus in FijiPs - we will be travelling fro. We brisbane"
"I would say go and enjoy there are no know cases of Coronvirus currently in Fiji. Many bans are in place though read the below.https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-…PS We have booked and paid for our trip to Fiji in June too.Edited: 7:51 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"There are no confirmed cases in Fiji. They have banned travellers from several countries from entering Fiji.Australia and NZ have confirmed cases.Go and enjoy.Edited: 10:14 pm, February 29, 2020 "
simple fact: Go or lose your money. I know that is harsh but it is true. The resorts will not give you a refund and your travel insurance will generally not pay out because it is a known risk.Sorry but these are the facts.
As far as travel insurance is concerned it depends on when you took out your insurance before or after the virus was detected as insurance companies now do not cover the virus in their policies.
"We did not explicitly take any insurance, but we get that as we paid by our credit card"
I don't think you will be covered on your credit card either if you cancel but you can check with the company who issued you card if you want to..
We too are covered by our credit card. If unable to travel due to destination being closed due to virus or weather reasons you should be covered. As long as you booked prior to outbreak. Fiji is ok.I wouldn’t be worried at this stage go and enjoy
We (2 adults and 1 child) also traveling to Fiji from Los Angeles April 5 - 12. Fiji seems okay with no COVID-19 cases.. we will keep an eye out though
Fiji is Covid-19 free. So go and enjoy.
Here is the very latest from Fiji as they too are taking all safety steps.https:/…
"Insurance provided via credit cards are not covering Fiji travel. Not even our purchased trip insurance is covering it, because Fiji is virus free and there are no ""hard and fast"" restrictions on travel from our country. The insurance company says ""We do not cover FEAR of travel. We cover personal illness that makes travel impossible""."
"Correct no insurance policy will cover "" Fear of travel"" even credit card insurance.If you can't go because a death or accident in the family then that will be covered.Just because you don't want to go for fear of cyclones , Mosquitoes. Floods etc etc does not get you a cancellation payout."
That is true they do not cover fear of travel. As there is no Corona virus in Fiji there should be no reason to fear travelling there. Should it occur Fiji Govt. state that they are equipped medically to care for infected patients
You and only you can now decide whether to travel or not with two kids in tow.The forum can only state what is the current situation in Fiji.
