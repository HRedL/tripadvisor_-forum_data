Here’s the CDC is at Level 3 for travel advisory to parts of Europe.https:/…coronavirus-europe

ATF - where have you seen that France is at Stade 3? Thx!
"France now implementing some Level 3 measures but still waiting for the official declaration from the health minister: https://www.liberation.fr/france/2020/03/12/…Schools closed as of Monday.70 years old plus, and people of risk to stay at home if possible, and don't visit these people.Take public transport which will remain open when necessary.Wash your hands.Don't touch anyone.And please go out and vote on Sunday in your local municipal elections.Any and all of this subject to change.."
so not yet Stade 3. This is important for people in this forum who may have AirBnB reservations because last I heard AirBnB will only reimburse cancelled stays once France declares Stade 3.
"The CDC has already proved that it is incompetent (or at least grossly underfunded) in this particular situation. They already don't know what to do in the United States, so I wouldn't really put much faith in their advisories regarding foreign countries."
I would follow the CDC guidelines. Once it goes to level 4 travel to the listed countries will be prohibited (for Americans).
"Sure, but whatever the CDC says has absolutely no influence in Europe regarding refund or cancellation policies. We have our own European rules, believe it or not."
"There are two different sets of guidelines issues by US government agencies. One set from the State Dept, one set from the CDC.The CDC are purely advisory-they don't prohibit anyone from doing anything, and their highest level is 3.https:/…travel-notice-definitionsThe State Dept, on the other hand, does have a level 4-Do Not Travel. But in practice, that's pretty much advisory, too, since with a little hard work it is easy to get to level 4 countries.So exercise caution, but it's up to the traveler to decide-and it's very unlikely a level 4 would be issued for any country in Europe.Edited: 5:42 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"And the CDC-making up for lost time, apparently-is now issuing guidelines for travel in the United States.https:/…And Trump has indicated that he'd consider a travel ban within the United States.https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-ne…Best source of information regarding the situation in France would most likely be French health officials, as it's clear US officials are now mostly focused on the spread of the contagion in the US."
