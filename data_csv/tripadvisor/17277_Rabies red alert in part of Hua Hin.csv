"https:/…rabies-red-alert-in-part-of-hua-hinI believe the count for the year is 6, not 5. And where is that photo taken from .... LOLPhotoshop comes to mind. ....Edited: 2 years ago "
One case was a Myanmar boy who came to Thailand for treatment but was too late. So 5 would be correct. But rabies is something that should be sorted out quickly by the authorities otherwise this could escalate rapidly. So many stray dogs around.
Also part of Bangkok has been declared a temporary Rabies zone.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g293…
"Dogs are a real problem in Thailand, nearly bitten 3 times last trip, 2 were very close encounters. That is more than all the other countries put together over about 30 years."
"Hi,The Dogs will always sneak up on you from behind, so beware of them,especially in the nighttime. Maybe you'd carry a stick with you to try tokeep them away."
"People who are infected with rabies die a horrific death and there is nothing ""LOL"" about it."
"The LOL is about the 'photo', and HH never looked so good.Not to say that people dying in some circumstances isn't funny, but rabies wouldn't be one of them, even though the patient hasn't a clue what's going on. As bonker's mad at the time.Chuckle worthy if doing something really stupid to get themselves bit."
I find nothing amusing about this article including the beach picture. The fact that there has been articles in the media almost everyday since arriving here means the problem is growing. It doesn’t matter how many have died just that some poor people have is to many.The most recent article is looking at stiralization of males good idea but to late for this current problem. However something must been done about strays as they are very aggressive and you do not need to be doing anything for them to attack.
"If you read the news today, all the 'do gooder / animal activist' are crying now because something IS being done, finally about the soi dogs. Though I don't see them volunteering to take the dogs in and keep them safe. I say, kill 'em all, and start enforcing the 'Animal Protection Laws'.in case you missed it: nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30341364And the beach photo is funny. Just wish I knew where it was taken from."
Have they changed the photo? If not what is funny about it? What the text says seems in line with both the pic and the article.
No I hadn’t seen that one our hotel supplies Bangkok post. Animal rights groups can be their own worst enminies at times in this case more dogs do need to be rounded up. As an animal lover myself I do not agree with poison food a needle is much more humane. Surely people can be easily trained to do this at such times of need.It is always more important that the human life must come above religious and cultural beliefs at this time I am sure that the protesters would not like to contract such an horrific disease. My observations throughout Asia has shown that these poor deserted dogs and cats would be better served either neutered or dead.
"This photo, as I've don't ever remember HH, that nice. I think it's the small patch of beach in front of the Hilton : https:/…c1_1429466_620x413.jpgEdited: 2 years ago "
"Am I missing something here? Yes I know dogs can be a problem,but under the first photo the caption says it was a cat bite ,not a dog bite.Is there a record anywhere, of how many people have actually been bitten by dogs?"
My doctor just told me what vaccinations I needed and said to be aware of Rabies but not essential. Think I might have to go back to them and ask about this. Very sad
"Your doctor's advice will probably be the same. Despite there being more recorded cases, the requirement for rabies vaccination has not been raised to essential or mandatory. It remains, like all vaccinations for Thailand as recommended but dependent on areas you propose to visit and the risk involved there. It is your attitude to risk that matters."
# 12 ....... yes there is (record) somewhere
"# 12 ......... maybe this will help why dogs are targeted, and not pet cats, though all should be vaccinated.nationmultimedia.com/img/photos/2018/Februar…Edited: 2 years ago "
"There is no easy solution but surely indiscriminate poisoning (where dogs take hours to die) is not the answer. Some of the dogs rounded up are street dogs that are looked after as best can be by small charities and individuals (sterilised, vaccinated, vet treated) now dead - for what? That's just population control not addressing the rabies problem. Consider the number of deaths from car accidents and drownings in Thailand compared to deaths from rabies - I think the problem is being blown out of all proportion and could easily have been addressed through authorities spending a few bucks sterilising street dogs and educating owners of the need to desex their pets."
As far I can see from media reports is that just one of the deaths was caused by a cat the rest appear to be dogs. The deaths are spread around not just in this area. What I have read is that red alert is current for this area includingSam Yod NP I had planned to go there but as they didn't give what kind of animal has been found to have rabies there we will stay close to our hotel in Pranburi.It may sound paranoid to some but we have had a group of dogs stalking us here already and in some places there are very large packs who fight constantly. This morning it is front page news again in Bangkok Post but just do Goodes claiming foul play by the govt.Two many unwanted and uncared for dogs roam throughout Asia and not doing anything for them will not help them. Some are very hungry and in desperate need if no one can care for them then euthanasia is the only way.This would help in the spread of this disease and would make the place more safe for everyone. Just last night a stray went troppo in the restaurant under a locals table they were screaming.
"Thanks Loki for the guide and Jules, as you are there now and seem to be in the thick of it.We have been coming to Hua Hin for 17 years now.The only aggressive dog pack we have come across, was at a temple in Sam Roi,when they ran after our scooter.We arrive the end of May.We travel around a fair bit and walk the beach, tide allowing, in the mornings.I will report on any encounters."
"Strangely, monkeys not getting a mention of late, rabies wise, and don't seem to be a main carrier, if at all. Though can be a nasty bunch, and some big choppers.Give them a wide berth at south end of HH beach near vendors and big Buddha at hillside.This charming fellow wasn't too happy with me taking a snap, and I was quite a distance away. Spooked me, and had me looking over my shoulder.......LOLhttps:/…WP_20150316_07_42_48_Pro.jpg"
"ugh hate those monkeys and I think they are more dangerous than any dog..Around chopstick hill,I saw one charge up the beach and pinch a bag of crisps off a little girl sat on a sun bed.Fortunatley it was just the shock that made her cry.It was so fast,very nasty and the viewing point is overrun by the blighters.."
"ManchesterBusterNothing has changed then. The Buddhist Monks feed them every day. We watched one steal a soft drink bottle from a sealed basket on the front of moped, unscrew the top and drink most of it."
"The road up to the viewing point has food all along the walls for them and I couldn't believe how many were up there.babies are cute but not for long,those males are scary ,as Loki's photo shows.."
The UK web sites have not upgraded any information with regards to Rabies in Thailand. See.....https:/…entry-requirementshttps:/…Vaccine_recommendations
">The road up to the viewing point has food all along the walls for themThe city painted 'do not feed' signs in Thai all along that wall. Also trimmed back the overhanging vegetation, making it much easier to see them. Monkey presence along the wall has drastically reduced."
"Also introduce a chemical sterilization plan, which I wish they would down here, PKK municipality, as it's monkey's gone wild at time.......LOLhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMKDCJxrorYhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/R8u7xq31ZEiBNUuu2https://photos.app.goo.gl/OD9NyOp8ScHldeo42"

"Well said #17All these 'nearly bitten' posts don't really make me worry. I was ''nearly bitten'' lots of times before I lived here and learned that almost all dogs will shy away when you turn and confront them or bend as if to pick up a stone. And, yes, I've been intimidated by packs of dogs here but only when I was walking my own dog.Despite the unfathomable 'LOL' sprinkled throughout this post, it's a serious matter but not one that justifies mass poisoning."
"I think a lot of people are missing the point. It's not about the number of deaths.If you or your child gets a scratch, nip or bite. Your going to have to seek immediate medical treatment. In which case the minimum is that your holiday is over!This is unacceptable.There are strays that hang around the beaches, stays that hang around restaurants and 7-11s (are they really reincarnated teenagers???).But also there are also guard strays where people feed them so that they will be territorial and protect that area. I assume due to the high crime rate.The pro stray press reports are probably written by Thais that do not walk unless air conditioned.It may be Thais will have to choose between mad dogs or English tourists."
"I think living there and visiting are different, if you live there then you are not a stranger anymore. I think dogs often will attack strangers, my close encounters were both off the main road. One was when I was cycling to a beach, these 2 dogs came out of this garden, I think they would have bit me if the owner did not call them off. The other time was a rough area between a soi and the main road in Kanachanburi, about 10 dogs came out from by this bamboo house, fortunately a local was nearby and sent them off. Even some of my Thai friends are frightened of dogs esp. at night. Night time is worse, yes they do roam around beaches, had another encounter in Ban Krut. Many of these dogs are not strays, they are fed and owned by they let them roam around in the evening. So best to stick to the main roads, many dogs stay in the sois.English tourists have been more than replaced by chinese."
"Agree, the owned dogs, are more territorial, and sadly, the owners let them run free. Most incidents, barking and charging toward me, with or without my dogs walking, are from pets, or well fed 'strays' just outside a house, usually plot of land next to or on the soi.Obviously discarded, but fed. The mangey lot, usually fear me, and keep their distance."
thank you for the update 25
"Never, ever had a problem with dogs in Thailand in the years we've been going.. Though funnily enough I've seen several three legged dogs especially around the Kwai bridge. Dogs in Goa on the other hand are a flamin' nuisance. Especially on the beaches, dog muck on the surf line, dog muck in the beach. I suppose it's all about perceptions."
"Re post #33Same for us. We have spent months in Thailand as long stayers (Bangkok, Hua Hin, Pattaya, and Phuket several times) and never had a much of problem with dogs. Twice we were in Cavelossim in Goa and the dogs were a real nuisance, and they roam in packs."
"if you come to Thailand with rabies and sadly die here, it is very much a case of rabies in Thailand.....everyone who's been in contact with this lad must be checked and the virus stays on after death........ this is a case of rabies in Thailand. Not normally transmitted person to person - in fact hardly ever, but it is my animals coming in over borders and from other areas after ill-advised culls that the disease is helped to spread.rounding up dogs and killing them helps the spread of the disease.Rounding up dogs, neutering,vaccinating them and putting them back, stops the spread of rabies and eventually reduces the dog population.It is unfortunate that Rabies engenders so much panic in the public which is so often followed by an inappropriate response."
"That's one opinion, though not supported by any facts.USA for instance, has 1 to 3 cases a year (23 in the last decade Aug2017), even though 5 times the human population of Thailand, and so much larger, land area wise. Easily 20x the congested population of cites.Yanks round them up and kill them."
"no they cull a disparate dog populatation.Thailand is not the same and people are claiming that ""extermination"" - or ""set Zero"" will work which it won't.the fact is that in the US they still get rabies.Most countries that control their garbage has relatively lw populations of free-roaming dogs... the US being one even with great open spaces - if the food ain't there the dogs won't come.If you create a gap in the dog population it is filled with other dogs either through moving in on the food supply or by taking up the slack through breeding.Thailand has about 10 million dogs. In BKK there are 3 quarters of a million with another 4 million or so free-roaming around the kingdom.the food supply is crucial to the size of the population . Dogs are scavengers and Thailand presents a food supply that encourages dogs to breed. They aren't actually that healthy and the life span is 3 to 5 years. In that time the descendants of one female dog can number over 60,000.The authorities in BKK are NOT going to have a mass cull in BKK, there is at present a 6 year plan to reduce the dog population to a controllable level. This is capture vaccinate, neuter and release.This way the dog population gets a herd community and the birth rate goes below the death rate.this program has already been successful on Phuket reducing the dog population from 80,000 to around 6000.in any area where Rabies is found, a 70% vaccination introduces herd immunity to the population.Bear in mind too that ALL MAMMALS can carry rabies and it is easily transferred inter-species through a bite or scratch.If you were to successfully extermination all the dogs in an area and then prevent other dogs from coming in, you next job would be to deal with the booming CAT population - who of course also carry rabies....you'd also need to extermination all wild mammals in the region.This is a task Sisyphus would be familiar withso as vaccination and neutering actually works why embark on an exercise that has repeatedly been shown to fail?"
"A combination of licensing, euthanasia of stray dogs, muzzling, and other measures contributed to the total elimination of rabies from the United Kingdom in the early 20th century.Perhaps Thailand could learn from history?"
"Eliminating Rabies from an island is a MUCH easier task than on a mainland. It enabled restriction of movement into the islands from the continent. Rabies is controlled through vaccination of animals.Although UK has an increasing stray problem the population (about 100k) is considerably smaller than in Thailand and as Tokay points out it can be controlled to some extent by capture and after holding euthanasia as part of a general broad spectrum control program. This is the standard way of controlling a relatively small dog population, but with a large population and land boarders, culling only produces gaps for other dogs to fill.It should be noted that the Changwats that border Cambodia have th highest rabies occurrences.""the last death from indigenous rabies was in 1902."" - BBCThe WHO and the Global Alliance for Rabies Control says the best way of preventing human infection is to eliminate rabies infections in animals through vaccination. This is the best and most cost-effective way of reducing deaths from rabies. - BBC.The last mass ""cull"" of dogs (pets) in Britain was at the start of WW2, a mass panic after it was warned that pets would not be allowed in air-raid shelters - this was nothing to do with Rabies or population control.Edited: 2 years ago "
"# 37 that's some funny stuff. Exterminate all mammals......well, that's inevitable, but not for a while. And we only do Norse mythology, not Greek."
"interesting that the Norse equivalent is Loki, so I suppose you're familiar with pointless tasks...."
"I was beginning to wonder Frithwood, whether I was mistaken...but we do tend to notice this kind of thing. As for Goa, the number of people that encourage the dogs on the beach was astounding and it was highlighted in the Goa Times that they were running low of anti rabies vaccination....words fail me."
"Update on the rabies, and not as under control as I thought, and quite the opposite. Tourist trouble areas seem to be ChonBuri and Prachuap Khiri Khan, Khao Yai (Korat), Nong Khai.Now 17 have died this year. Up quite a bit from the previous 6 being reported.""Many local administrative organisations do not have sufficient quantities of standardised vaccines to immunise the local dog and cat population, resulting in efforts to stop the outbreak taking longer or even failing""Map and info at Link if interested:nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30352154Edited: 2 years ago "
"As ever the media like to over hype things like rabies...""poor quality vaccines and a vaccine shortage have hampered efforts to curb the incurable disease.""

"As ever the media like to over hype things like rabies............not sure that's possible, when the disease is fatal.""poor quality vaccines and a vaccine shortage have hampered efforts to curb the incurable disease."" Nation............multiple reports of receiving an inferior supply, so maybe not restocked, and they have vaccinated a lot of animalsThe deaths so far of humans are 17 against 11 last year......... 50% more, and the year's not over yet, no over hype IMOinterestingly the map shows Samui has having rabid dogs....I'm told that the island is rabies free............they have the numbers, as opposed to the people with vested interest that report nothing but sunshine and rainbows during rainy season. No such thing as rabies free in Thailand.Thailand does much better than its neighbours are rabies control and there is no ""outbreak"" at present...variations are withinstatistical norms.............a bit controversial to the facts and you other thoughts.However bureaucratic ineptitude is rife in Thailand and it seems that both immunisation of pets and humans is not as good as it should be.............3rd world, to be expectedTravellers to anywhere on the plan should be aware of the risks of rabies and should already be vaccinated before travel.............that's over hype IMO, vaccinate before getting bit, unless away from medical facilities, which is rare in Thailand, unless overnight trekking.Just my thoughts"
