Arrived last night and today some self rightious american woman claiming to be an expat on a scooter told me I must wear a mask to make the locals feel better.Several of my relatives live and work here and they have a different view. I feel so ashasmed by this.
"Well, there are places where you MUST wear a face mask:https:/…53495.htmlBut you're going to be looked on as thoughtless and selfish if you don't wear a mask.> feel so ashasmed by this.By what? The fact that Vietnam had no new cases for three weeks until it was re-imported by people coming in from richer countries with a far bigger health spend who hadn't done a good job of containing it who then wandered around Vietnam making a massive task for the Vietnamese authorities to trace them, clean up everywhere they'd been, cover the cost of quarantining them and trace and test their contacts.Yes, I'm ashamed of this too."
You should wear a mask.We know they're next to useless stopping the virus but locals think they do.I've lived here 5 years and never worn a mask until now.
There's the rub. Masks are useless. We use em on planes. 15 in the plabe here fron bangkok.
"In the last few days i've started wearing one in crowded places (as suggested in current government guidelines) and when interacting with locals, esp those that are wearing masks themselves."
"Do it for the locals, they have always believed air borne germs are more deadly than those passed by hand.I know its a virus and masks dont help much at all, but I would recommend you wear a mask to fit in."
"That's all very well, but when we were in Vietnam recently no face masks were available and all the pharmacies had sold out.The problem with everyone wearing face masks makes it more difficult for essential workers such as those working in the health sector to obtain adequate supplies, to protect both themselves and vulnerable patients.Travel safe !"
Don't really matter now. Aust government has told us to get home asap as they intend to close the borders. We fly out Thursday am and will need our masks for home.
The situation wasn’t exactly helped by the Vietnamese socialite who selfishly wasn’t honest & open prior to taking her flight back in early March. Let’s not forget that and the contribution that’s made to the spread of the virus
Wear the mask for the benefit of the locals if nothing else
You said that the facemask have no ability to prevent the virus. What a shallow thought!!! That's the reason why pandemic in Europe spread very quickly
"Majority of face masks are next to useless after ten minutes of wear, in fact they harbour germs. anybody iwho works in the medical profession will tell you that. The virus is also ingested through the eyes. The mask is good for those who might already have the virus , it will help them reduce the spreading. If you educate yourself you can find all of this information out. Social distancing is what’s needed, not everybody walking about wearing flimsy masks.Edited: 4:22 am, March 18, 2020 "
It been stated ad nauseum by scientists that face masks are of little use. And it gets worse if you have a beard.Doctors use them when they are operating on or inspecting wounds so they dont breathe a big dose of germs onto a patient. It works ok for a short time.
You anger is completely wrong. Because now it is stipulated that anyone traveling to Vietnam must wear a mask to prevent Covid 19 epidemic for themselves and for the community.

It will cost you for not wearing a face mask. Except it to go nation wide.https:/…53722.html
