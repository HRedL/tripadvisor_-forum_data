We are considering a romantic getaway this summer and found a place on VRBO in Point Loma (I think that’s what it was called) with a lookout over Ocean Beach on a cliff. There are some actual walking beaches within 10 minute walk away. I saw suggestions to stay in La Jolla or Coronado areas as well. Would like to have a place we can sit out on balcony and see forever out in to the ocean but also be by beach to go swimming in. Romantic or secluded areas a plus . Need to stay at $300 or less per night. I just want to to see if there are anymore recommendations. I want it to be perfect and I’m kind of a research fanatic . Thanks !
Did we not already respond to your questions?
"You won't find any place that's secluded and romantic and has ocean views and is right next to a beach anywhere in San Diego. Beachfront properties here are built right next to each other. Mission Beach and Pacific Beach have a lot of rentals, and some of them are just across the boardwalk from the sand and have patios and balconies. They are wall-to-wall though, and I don't know if you'll find one for under $300/night -- it depends when you're coming. But now might be a good time to book if you're flexible with your dates since a lot of people aren't planning ahead right now due to Covid-19, so there are more vacancies than usual for later in the year. Just be prepared to cancel if we go through repeated cycles of lockdowns. There are some places that rent out on VRBO in La Jolla, but most of them are going to be a few blocks from the beach as well. Anything that's right across the street from the water is going to be more than $300/night for most of the year.Coronado will not work for you. The only place with ocean views is the Hotel del Coronado at way more than $300/night. VRBO is not legal in town unless you are staying for more than 26 nights, so you also can't rent a private home with ocean views, even if you could find one that cheap."
"Just wanted to see if there were anymore opinions or advice and thanks to Cathy A , I got some. Thank you Cathy! It’s very good to know Coronado only offers the hotel as far as what we want . Much appreciated !"
The Sunset Cliffs area of Point Loma/Ocean Beach would give you the view you want and there are homes on the cliff on VRBO.
Be careful when looking at Point Koma. It's right under a flight path and it can be loud.
"So for those of you that live nearby ....am I understanding correctly all the beaches are starting to open? If we come in mid June, it probably will be near the Sunset Cliffs if the VRBO condo we have our eye on is still available . What other restrictions are in place through June as of now ?Thanks for any help. We haven’t booked anything yet and just want to make sure mid June isn’t too soon for a romantic much needed getaway ."
"<>We don't know what things will look like in June! Heck, we don't know what will happen tomorrow, no less next month.Edited: 3:34 pm, May 03, 2020 "
"As of now, the Health Order restrictions are ""until further notice"". There's no end date, so they could go all the way through June or July or later; or they could be lifted sooner, either in whole or in part. It could also happen that restrictions are lifted and then reimposed. Things change pretty frequently, so it's on you to keep checking back.You can read the latest county health orders here: https:/…health-order.htmlYou can see that restaurants are closed except for takeout, bars are closed. Non-essential busineses are closed. All tourist attractions are closed. You must have a mask in your possession and use it whenever you're indoors other than your residence or outdoors within 6 feet of a person you don't live with. As of now, these conditions apply to the beaches near Sunset Cliffs: ""Beaches shall be used solely for walking, running, hiking, equestrian or bicycle riding (where allowed). The public shall not congregate or participate in active sport activities at said facilities. Swimming, body surfing, boogie boarding, surfing, kite surfing, paddle boarding, kayaking, snorkeling and scuba diving from the shore may be allowed in the ocean and bays connected thereto."" Again, the rules could be different in June, so you'll have to check whatever the current orders are at that time.Edited: 10:21 pm, May 03, 2020 "
You will most likely also have to wear a mask throughout your flight.
Thank you!! We are holding off on booking a little get away mid June until we feel we can enjoy the trip enough to do so . The main purpose is some R and R and beach time but would love to experience some restaurants or a dinner cruise and maybe the gas lantern area . Some of those may not be options for awhile I’m guessing and will have to decide if we can settle for less . Thanks !
"May and June are our cloudiest months of the year, (not so far this May). It doesn’t means overcast every day or all day but those months have a name, May gray and June gloom. During normal times I’d suggest pushing your trip beyond midJune, this year I absolutely would come later in the year, The beaches more than likely will be open to lay out on by June, right now only for exercising, surf, swim, walk, run, but restaurants and bars may still be trying to figure out how to do things. I’d think July will be better than June and August better than July."
"We stayed on Mission Beach through a vrbo.com rental. sitting on the balcony was great for beach views, sunset views, people watching. The beach is huge and we weren't near public parking so it was very, very low crowds. I think it was a bit over $300/night though, like maybe $2500 for the week. (2017)"
"We stayed at BEACH CLIFF VILLAS, 1352 sunset cliffs blvd, San Diego, 92107 it has a row on condos very nice and the backyard view is right on the cliffs and water open your window/door at night and u will hear the crashing water it is beautiful it is right in between Ocean Beach and Point Loma you won’t find anything in all of San Diego closer to the water as in right on!"
"Hunh.... a brand new user touting a very specific property right down to the address.... and with a name that implies they live in San Diego.Not sure what you've decided OP, but I don't think enough restaurants will be fully open to give you the experience you are looking for."
