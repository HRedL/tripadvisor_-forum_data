"In Japan 25 March - 5 April as first time visitors to Tokyo/Kyoto/Hiroshima/ Osaka. What will we find ? Restaurants/ shops / hotels/transport /tourist spots/ numbers of visitors ? How is the cherry blossom ? What’s the weather forecast ? Need up to date information not a lecture on the corona virus or how difficult it is to reschedule flights or get refunds. Would appreciate answers from recently returned visitors or people actually in Japan, not from those thousands of miles away possibly ignorant of the true picture.We are aware of the health situation and we will feel as safe in Japan as we do in Uk.."
"The Standard Cherry Blossom opened yesterday in Tokyo, as I wrote here. https:/…106022895It will fully bloom from March 21 to 29 in Tokyo, from March 26 to April 3 in Hiroshima and Osaka, and from March 27 to April 4 in Kyoto, according to the latest Cherry Blossom 2020, as follows.https://www.japan-guide.com/sakura/Please read these. https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3050.htmlhttps://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3407.htmlhttps://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4018.htmlhttps://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3951.html"
"We live in Kobe area. On Sunday (3/15) shops and restaurants were bustling, many people out and about on a sunny day. The majority were not wearing masks. These were regular neighborhoods and urban areas, not tourist sites."
"Hi Bellmatic,It might be worth having a read of my x2 posts from last week. We landed back in London yesterday after 9'ish days of traveling around. As a quick summary we weren't planning to visit any museums anyway so those closures didn't impact us. The only thing that did was the viewing platform at the Tokyo Metropolitan Govt building (free) so we paid to go to the top of the Tokyo TV Tower (which was actually great!)Otherwise though we didn't find a single park, shrine, temple, restaurant, shop or bar that we wanted to visit closed (and we covered a LOT of ground in the time we were there). We found 90% of people working in a hotel / shop / restaurant to be wearing a face mask, with lots of anti bac dispensers in hotel lobbies / restaurants. We had a fantastic time, saw everything we wanted, never felt like we were 'the only people' visiting a tourist site, experienced the craziness of the subway and Shibuya crossings, had some fantastic food and drinks and some heartwarming conversations with Japanese people (many of whom are concerned most of all that tourists will stop visiting). Feel free to ask any questions!"
"Good to know, have already had to chop Hong Kong out of our trip of a life time , glad to hear Japan is still open. Thanks"
"I live in Tokyo, and am here now. I've posted some descriptive essays of daily life in the west end of the city, though more of daily life from an expat's pov than a tourist's experience (I did swing by Ghibli Museum, just to see what it looked like closed.The short version? As many others have reported, from Tokyo and other cities around the country, the immediate impact has not been that dramatic, other than closures and event cancellations, some panic buying/shortages, and students fresh-sprung from classrooms just in time for spring...As I say, I've written a few posts and posted a lot of pictures (always, but especially recently), which you can check out at https://medium.com/tokyo-kills-me if you're interested."
"Those of you selfish enough and still taking non-essential travel should all read this:https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/20…It's especially irresponsible to travel from the epicenter of the pandemic (Europe) to other countries at this time. I seriously hope the op reconsider. We all need to fight this together, and each does his/her part. Japan should ban or restrict entry from European countries."
Why then do you think the Japanese Government and technical/medical advisors have not banned entry from Europe?Why do you think their considered and measured response is wrong ?
I’ve been hearing from Japanese friends and neighbors that they think it’s for the Olympic Games. Still trying to make it seem like nothing is wrong here. One friend in Kyōto said that 4 people from his office went into hospital yesterday and that’s never happened before. And they happen to sit in the same group in the office. Two side by side and two across from each other. A little office cluster of desks. So now people at work are all worried.
Because they don’t want to cancel the Olympics. It’s a very foolish tactic
"Daily life in Tokyo: The Good, the Bad, and the ForebodingYes, for now, it's feels like more or less ""business as usual"" in the city, BUT people including us are starting to cancel plans to travel within Japan. I don't know of anyone self-isolating within their homes yet, but I do know plenty who have cancelled spring break trips to the countryside, etc. So far, our trip still doable - shinkansen running; ryokan open - but for all the same reasons people are self-isolating - don't want to infect, or be infected - under current conditions we won't be going. And, as i say, many others are making similar decisions. And because conditions here are continuing to worsen - more cases; more clusters - it wouldn't surprise me if domestic travel options such as the airlines (which curtailed domestic flights some time ago) will only increase). In other words, I wouldn't be surprised if soon it becomes much harder to travel within Japan as well.Hopefully, we'll turn the corner on Coronavirus and things swill will go back to normal, but while daily life here in Japan may look much the same as always, I'm afraid it will only get worse rather than better.More and more people are also telecommuting to work. My wife has to take her temperature every morning before she's allowed to into her building. If a single person in her company's highrise tests positive (thankfully so far no) the entire building will be closed and everyone regardless of personal health will telecommute until further notice.The kaiten sushi restaurant in our neighbourhood is still open, but plates of sushi no longer make the rounds on the constantly moving display - now you order plate by plate. Normally, we would have gone for lunch this weekend; but now like many others we are avoiding restaurants (though I do still go for a coffee from time to time).Trains and stations during busy commute times still feel normally crowded to me - eloblys and bagd, beriefaceses jammed into macks and knees and buttocks, but I hear that over-all ridership is down in tokyo 50%.At one, when I tried to ask directions yesterday (through a mask, and remaining a good meter at least away, two people stopped to help; one literally ran away).Had some business ""in the city"" yesterday, and stopped by Yasukuni Shrine. Granted, it was a cold and blustery day and there were a few people taking pictures of the remaining blossoms (it was blustery, as I say), and a gaggle of (new graduates?) young people taking group pictures in kimono. There were also obviously foreign tourists, or expats like myself playing tourist, but otherwise there was a real sense of ... emptiness in a major siteseeing spot in Tokyo.Again, as I say, I believe that will become more the norm as the situation here, as elsewhere continues to worsen."
So you both believe that the Japanese Government and its technical advisors are happy to risk the lives of their citizens and others plus the reputation of the country for some tawdry sports event to which many ‘athletes ‘ will be too frightened to appear.What evidence do you have for such a sweeping statement ?
">>Why then do you think the Japanese Government and technical/medical advisors have not banned entry from Europe?Why do you think their considered and measured response is wrong ?<<Unfortunately, Japan doesn't have a dynamic and decisive leader. Also, it's a taboo to offend anybody in Japanese culture. Remember how slow they were to ban people from Hubei? Not restricting or banning entry from Europ is very foolish, IMO. It's a new epicenter of the pandemic. Just look at how many people are infected and have died in Europe. Japan only has 825 as of today, March 16 US PST:https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.htmlI don't have the exact number, but several people who came cack from Europe became infected in the last few days. Japan really should ban entry from Europe now."
"#11Abe still thinks Japan can host the Olympics as planned, and he claims that the G7 supports it:https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl…If the Olympics is cancelled or postponed, Japane will lose billions and that's the bottom line."
"Olympic Games venues were being built in record time whilst people made homeless from the 2011 tsunami disaster were still in “temporary” housing (for years) when billions of yen were donated from around the world for those victims. New houses or apartment buildings couldn’t be built but the Olympic Games venues were ahead of schedule.Edited: 8:43 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"I hear you, Keith. I was hoping Tokyo won't get the Olympics from the beginning. Nothing good has come out of it so far."
"And it’s not just hearsay. I know a doctor who was going to Ishinomaki EVERY month for 10 days to treat the same people for so many years and she told me these things and I know a woman whose husband works for the Hyogo Prefecture disaster response team and whenever any disaster happens in Japan, every prefecture sends their teams to the affected area to get things going and he said that that was happening too. He was frustrated and the doctor was always sad about the people in Ishinomaki."
"Yes, it's a shame that many people are still living in ""temporary"" housing ( the majority are old and or sick). A fraction of the resources they have spent on the Olympics would have built nice new real houses for those."
"The Foreign Ministry is taking the next step to ask all the people coming from Europe to self quarantine at their homes or hotels for 14 days. It will be announced after it passes the National Security Committee on the 18th.https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/videonews/ann…Different from other countries, there won't be any penalties or fine when you ignore it, though. They are appealing to your conscience to cancel your trip."
"If people are wanting to know the atmosphere, the one thing I’m noticing today is that people here don’t want to be near Europeans more than Chinese people and that’s something new. If you hear French, Italian or German being spoken near you, you avoid them like the plague. Especially the ones who still believe wearing masks isn’t helpful. At the very least, people will resent their selfishness less for looking like they are not trying to spread the virus."

"Unfortunately, not yet AsiaNice! I saw 8 or 9 French tourists sitting in Maruyama Park today when it was mostly quiet and peaceful except for their screaming and laughing. People steering clear of them. I saw a group of 5 Spanish speaking people in kimono rentals and heard young Japanese women say “scary” about them in Japanese. Hopefully Europeans will soon be banned from entering or quarantined for at least two weeks."
UK Foreign Secretary has now said FCO is going to raise the level to no non-essential global travel for 30 days.
