"We had a fun 4 day trip to Disney but this last 24 hours have been hell for us. Group was, me and my wife, also our two daughters 4 year old and 1 year old. Also my parents came too. On Thursday morning at our hotel at 1am our 1 year old daughter threw up twice all over the bed. After housekeeping changing and going back to bed, she felt fine next day, but still has diarrhea tho. Yesterday on our flight home, when we were descending our 4 year old become ill and starting vomiting. She couldn’t hold anything down until we brought her into the ER back home. Also my mother got sick with vomiting like symptoms that wouldn’t stop until she got ahold of some Zofran from a friend. My father dad diarrhea last night. Then this morning at 6am my wife fell ill with vomiting like symptoms. Me well, not yet I hope!! Just wanted to give everyone heads up this sort of virus is going around Disney. We visited 1/21/19 thru 1/25/19 when we flew back. This bug is not good!"
"Please post your Orlando questions and statements on the Orlando forum instead. This is the statewide forum for all of Florida.As an aside, do you have confirmation that it was norovirus? Usually this diagnosis is assigned to cruise ship passengers."
"Very sorry your family is having a rough time with feeling unwell . My only issue with this post is : ""at disney world"" and ""around Disney"" is not very specific and frankly, not very helpful .  If there was a mass outbreak , I am thinking there would have been headlines by now . Unfortunately, some contamination can occur pretty easily and your family would be likely to spread it among each other as well but it sounds very difficult to pinpoint the actual source."
"""If there was a mass outbreak , I am thinking there would have been headlines by now""Exactly right!"
"Yes, with our 4 year old going into the hospital, he confirmed it Norovirus. He it told us it’s near impossible to track where it came from, but something we ate, touched, etc was done at Disney."
Well. why did no one else contract it?I find it hard to believe that only one person was affected.Why did the media not report this.
"in general, norovirus is a problem in all areas that have a large number of people incl cruise ships, theme parks- even grocery stores.Hand sanitizer is your friend."
"A definitive diagnosis of norovirus is confirmed by testing a stool sample. Was this done in the ER? You can guess a norovirus based upon symptoms and incubation times, but it is only a guess. Norovirus is highly contagious, contracted by eating contaminated food from a food handler who spread virus after using poor handwashing, touching a contaminated surface then putting your hands on your face or mouth, from the vomit of someone with the virus. Vigorous washing of hands with hot water and soap and not touching bathroom surfaces especially. Hand sanitizer does not prevent norovirus, but does prevent other viruses. It is difficult with children as they touch all surfaces and put hands in their mouths. It would have been better if you posted a question about the norovirus instead of posting an inflamatory statement. We were at Disney from Tuesday through Thursday, no reports of illness. That is not to say it isn't there, but there has been no confirmation or reports as yet. Hope you recover quickly and that you don't become ill. Incubation can be as short as a few hours up to 72 hours."
We had the same experience and were at Disneyworld 1/22/19-1/26/19. All four of our family members became severely ill. I called Disney directly to let them know and I recommend you do the same.

Our family is experiencing the same thing. We spoke with 2 families on the bus and another at our resort who said they were experiencing it as well. This week has been a nightmare. Oct 2019.
"Same here. We saw someone be sick when we were checking in at art of animation. Now 3 of our group have had the sickness bug. Might be in the pool water, don't know. 18 October"
This is the most common of stomach bugs. It is found wherever you have large groups of people. Use good hand hygiene which includes washing with soap before and after using the bathroom. Avoid using the electric hand dryers that actually contaminate your hands with airborne bacteria (paper towels or air dry). Use alcohol hand gel with at least 70% alcohol after each ride.
"""Use alcohol hand gel with at least 70% alcohol after each ride.""According to the CDC:  ""You can use alcohol-based hand sanitizers in addition to hand washing. But, you should not use hand sanitizer as a substitute for washing your hands with soap and water. Hand sanitizers aren’t as effective as washing hands with soap and water at removing norovirus particles. See “Handwashing: Clean Hands Save Lives.” https:/…prevention.htmlMore on preventing the spread of norovirus:https://www.cdc.gov/Features/Norovirus/And THIS from the National Institutes of Heath:""Hand sanitizers may increase norovirus risk""https:/…Edited: 10:44 am, October 18, 2019 "
This is serious. I just went to Disney with my 4 year old and the second day at the parks on our way to the hotel she throw up inside the shuttle. She couldn’t do the third park. We have been dealing with this nasty virus with her since Friday night 10-25-19. Vomiting and diarrhea with no appetite. Today when we are back home from our trip she is feeling better. Still weak and recuperating. The doctor said she got this bug from Disney.
"CrisAle.She could have picked up the bug from anywhere. You live in Ft Lauderdale, which is only a few hours from Orlando, so she might well have got the bug before you left home."
"We just got back from a week at Disney. Family of four, our kids 7 yr. old and 3 yr. old. My oldest complained her stomach hurt day 1 of the trip by day 2 she threw up before getting on rockin roller coaster literally right before she was about to step on lasted 2 days. Next was my husband on day 4 overnight into the next day. Then my 3 year old vomited day 5 at the grand Floridian all over the lobby!!!!! She was in bed and vomiting all day. Thankfully I got refunded for mickeys Christmas party bc neither could make it. Aside from this all 3 had diarrhea the entire week off & on. We stayed at the contemporary and washed hands on stop didn’t seem to matter. The staff at the contemporary were very helpful in bringing lines, offering medical support etc. Definitely something going around Disney. Just sharing for others to see. In spite of all of this they still had a great time (when they were t in the bathroom sick)."
"What a shame as you must have spent a large part of your holiday in your hotel room. No way could you have gone to the parks with everyone being so ill. Also, you would not have wanted to spread whatever it was."
"For others reading this post, norovirus or any virus(colds, flu, gastroenteritis) can come from anywhere. It’s not an epidemic at Disney, or Disney’s fault. Read the CDC information in the previous post #13. Wash hands!Edited: 8:24 am, November 10, 2019 "
Pretty much unless everyone spent every minute of their trip in Disney there is no way to tell where they picked up the bug
sounds more like food poisoning.
"""...My oldest complained her stomach hurt day 1 of the trip by day 2 she threw up before getting on rockin roller coaster literally right before she was about to step on lasted 2 days...""So it's quite possible your daughter picked it up somewhere before you got there and then as her symptoms emerged, others in your family picked it up.You might possibly have infected others who unwittingly touched handrails, etc after your family touched them.Noro is highly contagious, and can live on surfaces for long periods of time (days and weeks) if the surfaces are not specifically cleaned. ""sounds more like food poisoning.""Impossible to tell from the story. As many have noted, washing hands is your #1 defense.Limiting what you touch is always good (""keep your hands to yourself"") , and do not touch your mouth, nose or even rub your eyes without washing your hands well beforehand.It is shocking how many people leave a restroom and either don't wash at all, or Rinse and Run (a.k.a. Splash and Dash) without soap, or use soap like a magic potion thatinstantly kills germs without scrubbing.Get hands wet, get soap, scrub for 20 seconds, pay attention to cuticles, around finger nails and other places germs could hide, then rinse and scrub under the water before drying with paper towel and opening door with towel.This is not rocket science, it's common sense but old habits die hard, and most germs (bacteria and viruses) can be stopped before causing illness if people learn the new habit of not touching everything around them,of not touching their T zone,and of washing properly to remove germs."
