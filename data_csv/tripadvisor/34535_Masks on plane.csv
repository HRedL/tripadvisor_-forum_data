"While I agree on this policy and trying to keep middle seats open, Time to eat or drink water. Clearly the masks come off. I am confused about how long is too long being off, and yet ....if they come off, aren't we exposing others or are being exposed?"
I'm a mask wearer and yes---when you eat or drink---you pull it down. but it's for a short time. Some exposure will happen but it's better than the free for all that usually happens.when jetblue made that announcement yesterday that everyone must wear masks---i jumped for joy!now when those inconsiderate pendejos decide to whack and sneeze it up---they'll be snottin up themselves instead of spreadin the love.sorry for being so graphic but talk about pet peeve!!i hope every airline follows.
"Just received a message from American Airlines. The staff will be wearing mask at all times. And they will hand out masks and sanitizer to passengers as they board. And be doing super cleaning, and such of the aircraft. Step in the right direction."
"Masks are a very good idea. I wonder how some people will do that have claustrophobia while wearing a mask? I hope the plane ride is uneventful in those type of situations. They say the best seat to sit in is a window seat. It’s the most protected area in each row. One things for sure, Clorox wipes have gone to the top of my packing list. Maybe 2 big Clorox wipe cans right there in my checked on luggage. Plus, more (and a little squirt bottle too if allowed) for the airplane ride. You can only do so much and hope for the best."
"You must wear a mask to fly from a Canadian airport. Like in other countries, this will become the new norm, and people will learn to adapt to the reality of wearing masks. Pack a few, in case one rips or is dirty. A bottle of hand santitizer. Some of the tiny soap sheets for hand washing. Wipes for the tray table and surrounding areas. I also think the days of meals on board will be vastly changed. I see water bottles being handed out, and maybe basic food boxes. I am sure I would just be bringing my own food from home."
"I have given up on appearance vzs. safety long ago. You are not paying my bills and I am smiling under that mask feeling I am doing the best I can for the times. I am glad to hear masks are being passed out prior to flight times, but if you are already wearing a mask , will they still give you one? I have had a dickens of a time finding masks. My husband is wearing his dual filter painter's mask (looks like Darth Vadar) but he has a mask. We are trying to do our part, but haven't been on a plane wearing masks, so was curious what most people do. I ordered some masks based on a short delivery time BUT apparently the delivery from China (bwa ha) is running late. I had no idea they were coming from there. How dumb can you be. Iyam and Yaz don't answer that!!!"
"Look on etsy, you can buy lots of fabric ones quite easily."
"Masks on a plane are only potentially going to prevent someone who is already sick, from infecting others. The 'mask' is designed to catch the wearer's respiratory exhalations, any sneezes and/or coughs. If the mask is removed for even a few moments to eat or drink its effectiveness is compromised. The wearer of this mask (apparently sick) should not be on a plane let alone heading for vacation in the first place. On the other hand the N95 masks are designed to protect the wearer from those around that might be sick. What say you....?? ¡Diviertanse!"
"I've always carried sanitizing wipes when traveling and use them on all surfaces around my seat. I'm glad to hear about the mask though. I do eat their little snack, but I bring my own ""real"" food. I probably won't take their snack anymore.I wonder what the mask is like that American is handing out. I like my homemade mask but what if their mask is better, or maybe my homemade mask is better with it's extra filters? HmmmI wouldn't count on their gel hand sanitizer, bring your own because I can't imagine they will always have a good supply of it.Even taking the mask off to eat or drink is better than no masks on people the entire time.Edited: 10:24 am, April 29, 2020 "
"To throw a kink in the game and make you think faster. Airlines are beginning to consider some flights 1 May and will be flying almost regular schedules by 1 June unless there is a huge relapse. Weddings and conventions are a big draw. Some hotels are announcing openings 1 May with many more to follow 1 June and perhaps all by 1 July.This does not mean everyone will start to travel, but it will surprise you how many will be in the PV area by the early part of June."
"""when those inconsiderate pendejos decide to whack and sneeze it up""Some people have allergies, so the fact that they're coughing and/or sneezing doesn't mean they're contagious. Other people can develop a persistent cough due to the dry air on planes. People with these conditions should obviously follow good protocols with regard to covering their mouths when experiencing these types of things."
"In March, prior to Covid-19 being a problem, I used Lysol spray and Purell wipes. I used Zicam swabs in my nose. I still ended up with an upper respiratory virus. I get that about half of the time I fly. That's weird, as I'm usually quite healthy. I won't be flying without a mask."
When some Canadian airlines did evacuation flights. All air crew wore masks. Passengers had a bottle of water in their seat at take off. No meals. Flight attendants remained at their stations unless called.
"I usually get some respiratory crud when I go to PV in December, but not in June. I usually don't even start the crud in December until I've been in PV awhile since I stay for 3 weeks. I think mine comes from being around a lot more people when on vacation and dining out more than usual, not from the plane. I hear people all around me at tables etc. in PV coughing. I try so hard not to get it, but I do anyway."
santandy who are the individuals getting posts deleted?
"I had a terrible respiratory (went to San Mare) and was sick most of my Dec. trip. I used wipes, like Kansas, on every surface of plane and washed my hands like wild, Moved the vent thingie away from blowing directly on me, and still got sick. If and when we can go, I will be wearing a mask and Lord knows I could skip a meal and not waste away."
ot bound---kansas is right. i'm talking about the rude beyond rude peeps that just cough/sneeze without doing so in their sleeve or a tissue.i'm talking about the idiot behind me that was whacking and the hair at the crown of my head keep flying up and down.i understand allergies but a cough is a cough and a sneeze is a sneeze and it shoots out whatever germs is in your body. it doesn't have to be contagious.sorry i'm crazy about this and i still hope we all have to wear masks when we fly. fotgive me
"So are the airports, ground transportation, resorts ect going to insist on wearing masks when you enter? It makes no sense to wear masks on a plane then get rid of them when you enter the airport only to have the same people sneezing, hacking, & spewing their nasty germs all over you as you stand in line waiting to be processed through customs & Immigration.  Stay calm, wash your hands, avoid the crowds, & above all get that next vacation booked now, prices are starting to climb. Safe travels Life is good"
"The aircraft itself is not a insurmountable problem. The aircraft are cleaned well each night and now before each flight. The air circular system cleans the air constantly.By sterile wiping your seat trays, armrests, seatbelt closures , perhaps the seat itself, especially where our head rests (anything that you touch) then using a good sanitation lotion on your hands ( I even rub a little on my upper lip close to my nose ) You are in a safe environment. Now enters the unknown factor. The fellow passenger. Beside you, in front of you, behind you. If they will take the same precautions that you have taken the problem of flying in an aircraft is actually much safer than being in the terminal where many people touch the same objects and take few precautions. In the terminal I suggest the wear of disposable gloves. I , also, might add that one of the dirtiest places that you come in contact with is the tray in which you place your items to go through security. Just think how many shoes are put in that tray. I suggest disinfecting it and spraying your own shoes prior to using the tray. You speak of the rude and thoughtless behind, beside or in front. My answer is to nicely hand them a mask and politely say something to the effect , "" I almost forgot my mask this morning, but my spouse remembered it for me as I started out the door.""Also, I might add that it is a good idea to take a sterile wipe to the a/c restroom."
Off topic but up in canuckle land we cant go into Costco as of today without your own mask. In Victoria anyhow. Good on the airlines and Costco!
GREAT. Kansas happy to hear that
We've been doing this same procedure for years every time we board a plane. Better to be safe than sorry and so far we've been safe.
"This A.M I read a release from American Airlines that American Airlines and Delta will begin to require customers to wear face masks.Don't know how this will affect other airlines, but I am sure that most will follow suit."
"What kind of face masks, there are quite a few when I look on Amazon...any mask, or simply just a home made scarf over your face?"
"Even Michael O'Leary, the CEO of Ryanair, has discounted this empty middle seat proposal as it wouldn't allow social distancing - he put the distance between aisle and window seat at 2 feet, not the minimum 6!"
"Exactly Richard #28.Read earlier that for buses and trains to properly adopt a 2m distance between passengers then capacity would reduce to (not by) 12% of that of the previously full bus or train. So not economically viable unless massive subsidies or massive fare hikes.For planes, even in international first there is not going to be 2m between you and the passenger to your left or right...don’t even think about economy!"
If the airlines were to comply with the 2m (6’) social distancing on a 180 seat aircraft only 30 seats would be occupied. That’s not going to be viable. If governments are still going to have social distancing rules in place why can airlines not comply with these rules? For me keeping only the middle seat unoccupied is nonsense. Having all seats occupied but having to wear a mask is also no going to make me want to fly. For me travelling by plane is a no no until there are vaccines and we know more about this virus.
"I think you will see masks become mandatory on flights and possibly even within airport areas. Of course keeping things in public areas of airports sanitized is going to be extremely difficult to impossible. I won't be surprised to see food & beverage service discontinued on flights except on long-hauls. A bottle of water may be all you'll get on other flights, so it will be recommended to bring you own.In many communities, sewers have banded together to provided cloth masks for first responders, healthcare workers, those in assisted living and long-term care facilities, to name a few. Yesterday was the 2nd give-away for individuals in my community. Within the last month approximately 11,000 masks have been sewn and given away for free to critical groups and individuals, so anyone having trouble getting a mask should check within their community about finding organizations that are doing similar programs. Even if you're not flying, you should have one whenever you're out in public. Doesn't hurt to have multiples so you can switch them out or donate to someone in need.We have a long way to go before we're on the other side of this, so people should follow the guidelines and do their part. This is no time for a ""the rules don't apply to me"" attitude!"
"""It makes no sense to wear masks on a plane then get rid of them when you enter the airport.""I would definitely wear the mask the moment I enter the airport and on the plane."
"Unfortunately there are those who refuse to comply. We're seeing a lot of folks stating that the government has no right to restrict them, crowds at beaches and businesses open too early."
"I think the masks are great and the airlines are mandating them as they can't really do the 6 feet apart social distancing thing. Here in Michigan we must wear a mask in any inclosed space (store, etc) because in those places it is way to hard to maintain the 6 feet. If you can't maintain the 6 feet necessary- you wear a mask. Here hoping this damn virus just up and disappears like Ebola kinda did, or we get a vaccine."
"Here’s the thing, if you choose to refuse on a plane the pilot will come back say hello to you and show you the door. You can do what you want, but they don’t have to let you on the plane."
"My opinion is any mask is better than no mask, stops the bigger droplets from traveling 29 feet after a sneeze. But I wouldn't expect most masks to completely stop the fine contagious aerosol vapor emitted when breathing, talking and especially when is sneezing. Also, if someone's eyes are not covered, that is a possible contamination point from nearby aerosol vapor- even while wearing the much recommended n95 masks. For complete protection or prevention, someone might need a mask design similar to poison gas type mask that includes heavy straps and goggles."
"So where in the US is it you are able to get Clorox wipes? None here since firstvweek in March. Or Amazon, target.com, walmart.com..."
"Well, my flying mask is with the United logo, and I sip my wine through a straw, and a tiny hole.For eating, I lift the mask a bit, shovel the food into my mouth, than lower the mask to chew - repeat.Hunt"
"I have started making my own Clorox wipes and bought some as well on black market here. They are like gold and very hard to find. Easy to make...check Pinterest or google.We in my area are manf=dated to wear masks outside our homes. Social distance and all but essential places are closed. No tourists in either, to date we have no known cases, but when we lift the mandates I bet it is a brush fire."
"Masks in principle are effective but the people using them aren’t.As soon as you touch the mask to lift it up you have compromised the effectiveness and contaminated your fingers and then you touch your face.But that’s only if you are contagious If you are not contagious then why wear the mask?Many masks are only effective for a few minutes anyway not several hours Observing contamination and decontamination protocols takes training and lots of discipline Ask medics, nurses , hazmat firefighters .Whilst masks are a positive step in the right direction I wonder whether they are as effective as some might wish Cloth masks will stop droplets but they can never stop the passage of the microscopic virus anyway.The trick is to go down the road of ensuring that no one travels who is a risk to othersThat means testing, track and trace and maybe carrying some sort of document to state that you are clear Yes that is a long way in the future but don’t rely too heavily on masks and more importantly on the folk that use them.You can’t rely on the public to observe the necessary level of discipline What happens to the used masks - we know some folks attitude to discarding litter"
"I agree with leuca. Even with masks I do not want o fly until there's a proven vaccine to protect me from catching covid-19 if or when I'm exposed to it.Paranoid? Maybe I am. But I have several health issues and I'm at high risk. I've also seen too many images of very sick people, never mind devastated families who have lost loved ones.I'm not at all convinced that it will be possible to stop infected people form flying."
"The WHO said today, that all evidence suggests that the transmission of the virus does not work 'well' though air.It seems it's surfaces where most cases pick up the virus."
Of course it’s going to be impossible to stop infected people from flying particularly those who don’t even know they are infected.That is no different from stopping them going to the supermarket or any other public space.A vaccine is the obvious solution but that could be several years away and if we want life to return to anything approaching normal then we have to accept a degree of riskThe alternative is a life of isolation which will have significant impacts on our mental health
It's my decision and not flying is one I'm very happy with. It's much easier to have social distancing measures in shops compared to airports and aircraft.I don't think that my mental health is going to suffer simply because I choose not to fly.
"I agree with leuca. Any mask you wear rapidly itself becomes a source of infection and as soon as you touch it your protection is compromised. For very good reason, staff in operating theatres and areas where cross infection precautions are properly observed, rely on a "" no touch technique"". Once gloves, masks, gowns etc have been correctly put on, they touch nothing but surgical instruments and the surgical field. Adjusting a mask is a total no-no, someone else must do it for you, and wash their hands or change their gloves afterwards. We can't go through life morbidly obsessed by avoiding all possible risks, but we can take sensible risks based on understanding what they are. Assume every surface is filthy, you can't possibly clean it properly so don't touch it unnecessarily. Always wash afterwards, and if you are wearing gloves, take them off immediately afterwards and discard them. Always wash your hands before touching or preparing food. If it helps, imagine your nose, eyes and mouth are as dirty as every other surface, and don't touch them either. You only have to see the mess a small child can make with chocolate sauce to see exactly how far a small amount of a contaminant can be spread in seconds!"
">>If you are not contagious then why wear the mask?<<Because there are lots and lots of people who are contagious and don't know it... no symptoms (or not symptoms 'yet').If I'm contagious and wear a mask, I reduce the chances of infecting you accidentally. If you're not contagious and wear a mask, you reduce the chances of being infected.>>That means testing, track and trace and maybe carrying some sort of document to state that you are clear<<Testing will have to be improved before it's reliable... my understanding is that current tests don't distinguish between positive/contagious and positive/no longer contagious. And there's no evidence yet that prior exposure results in future immunity (although yes, other viruses do work like that). Plus the tests currently give a fairly significant number of both false positives (at least in that case, no harm/no foul) and false negatives. And someone who got their certificate a week ago (or even a day ago) could certainly catch the virus after the testing and be contagious by the time of the flight.Testing is great for tracing the disease and alerting people who have potentially been exposed. At this point, I don't think it's reliable for relaxing any of the other precautions.(This is all based on reading... if folks have credible sources that contradict this, I'm happy to be educated.)"
"My son found what I thought was a good illustration of the benefit of wearing a mask. Picture 2 men standing near to each other, both naked and one urinates towards the other. He obviously gets soaked. But if he were wearing pants the pants would catch most of the urine. If both men were wearing pants then only one man is soaked. Same with spit. Btw, Denver now has a requirement that everyone entering a business or waiting to get in must wear a mask. And the order specifically says no hole (not even for a straw) and it can't be the kind with the vent thing that I've seen advertised."
">>If you are not contagious then why wear the mask?<<That is a selfish perspective, thinking about only yourself and not others around you. If everyone in a shop or on a plane is wearing a mask, that reduces the chance of infecting each other greatly. There are many asymtomatic virus carriers around, they don't even know they have it so I don't blame them. But if they go outside and not wearing a mask, they can easily infect others. A face mask can reduce (but not complete eliminate) the damages they can cause, but we need to start somewhere. By wearing a mask, you take on your social responsibility of showing others you are doing your share to reduce the spread. And others get comfort from seeing everyone is wearing a mask. If someone is contagious and wearing a mask, at least they won't shoot the virus at you when they sneeze. That has some value.Face masks are in short supply now, so you may not be able to get the most protective ones. And there are many on sale on Amazon that are only slightly better than nothing. But something is still better than nothing. You get what you can get now, and you can always upgrade when better ones become available.In the order of protectiveness, my personal rank is as follows (from least desirable to most desirable): Any type of cloth face covering (including bandanas); Cheap face mask that I can buy right now online from unknown manufactuers; surgical masks from a reputable drug store (CVS, Walgreen, etc., in the hope that they screen out the fake ones), N95 or KN95 masks made by a company that I trust (3M or a company that have been making them before the Pandema for painters)I prefer a N95 mask with an easy flow valve to make it easier to breath. Mandatory use of masks on planes and terminals is a good move in the right direction. It is still not enough to get me on a plane during the Pademic, but that is a different topic."
"Edofva I think you have taken one phrase out of context As I am not a selfish person - far from it Allow me to expand my point to explain.200 passengers on a plane plus crew None of whom have virus and are not contagious Yet the scenario is going to be played out of sitting wearing ineffective masks for several hours.I am with you , if I thought there were contagious people on a plane or a cruise I would not be getting onI prefer the cruise line approach of having some set criteria before a passenger will be allowed to board And if those criteria are met and there is any doubt about the passengers status regarding CV then even at the foot of the gangplank they will be denied permission to board and be turned away"
"""If they will take the same precautions that you have taken""And there is the rub. I am never ever going to be aware of what precautions my fellow travelers have taken. I don't know whether or not they are asymptomatic carriers that could infect me - they probably don't know themselves.I don't believe that there is ever going to be a way to run flights in a way where everyone has a suitable level of isolation (even if they mandate mask-wearing, how do you stop people taking them off once the plane is in the air?So it's going to have to be up to me for my own safety. Before COVID-19 I was ok with being on planes and airports and subject to colds and flu etc. I took reasonable precautions. So it's going to take things with COVID-19 being brought to the level of the 'flu before I am going to consider it good for me to fly again.That means that effective treatments to lower the death rate, so that, if and when I get it, I have a reasonable chance of not dying (like RojBlake I am in an elevated risk category, according to the CDC information) and a vaccine in place that drastically lowers the chances of me getting it, should a contagious person be in my vicinity, coupled with a test for me to see whether I have immunity to the current strains.Until then I am happy to stay at home, or take trips by car, while maintaining social distancing."
"""I don't believe that there is ever going to be a way to run flights in a way where everyone has a suitable level of isolation - I wholly agree, in my opinion it seems that flying in the future is never going to be risk free even if they develop a vaccine which like other vaccines is unlikely to be 100% effective.Each individual will need to determine what level of risk they are willing to accept and that applies to flying as well as any other aspect of normal life."
"I don't feel like spending thousands of dollars on a ""fun vacation"" in a health environment where masks are important. Sorry, but we fly first because of health reasons (spouse has had multiple spine surgeries ) and no food, beverage, or bathroom use is not exactly a bargain. I can stay well at home. I won't fly without a vaccine, water and movement to prevent blood clots (spouse had PE from DVT), and bathroom use."
"Leuca (#49)If you were not suggesting what I thought you suggested, then may I point out the faulty assumption you used in dismissing use of face masks - ""200 passengers on a plane plus crew, None of whom have virus and are not contagious...""That is a big assumption that unfortunately no one should count on. Far from it. Random testings of the the general population have shown a good percentage of those tested have the anti bodies, meaning they had been exposed to the virus and perhaps recovered without knowing it. And there have been reports that a large percentage of those infected were asymptomatic for at least a period of time before they show symptoms. So to assume that a random selection of 200 plus people are all without the virus and are not contagious is just wishful thinking. It is dangerous to assume that whoever you encountered on an airplane and the terminals are all virus free, and questioning why put on a mask if everyone is healthy and virus free. It is an assumption that no one can afford to make at this time, if they value their health. IMHO.I am not saying you are selfish. I am only saying that we need to also think from the perspective of what is better for everyone. If everyone in a restaurant, a supermarket, or on a bus wear a mask, that makes everyone safer."
"Never assume I never base things on assumptions Again you take it it of contextTo be clear 200 people get on a plane who either have had CVor have not got CvThey are not contagious or likely to be The airlines should not allow random people to get on board Test and screen So why make all these harmless passengers wear masks They are not about to infect anyone on the flight The trick is to screen them before they are allowed to check inEdited: 2:52 pm, May 02, 2020 "
"If everyone in a restaurant wear a mask, that makes everyone safer. - How is mask wearing going to work in a restaurant."
The tests have big error rates at least US ones do.
"I understand how masks make everyone at least a little bit safer. But the prospect of wearing one for hours on end.... I can't imagine that. Just two hours, while waiting to get into the grocery store, shopping, and then waiting to check out, left me with a terrible headache. Keeping a mask on (except for needed food and hydration) throughout a fourteen hour flight across the Pacific?!?!? One more reason not to fly for a long time."
"Mexicomom..How long is too long..one sneeze too long.. Masks I think can work and do but not for anywhere we may eat or such. One of the airlines is starting mandatory mask-wearing May 11th, I forget which one< but what about May 2-10. LOL"
"<< I understand how masks make everyone at least a little bit safer. But the prospect of wearing one for hours on end.... I can't imagine that.>>You don't have to have much imagination. What about all of the healthcare workers, first-responders, and those in similar positions that are working 12-hour or longer shifts day after day? People are just going to have to suck it up and wear a mask or not fly. It's pretty simple."
BarbP..exactly!!
"It doesn't matter to me whether there are tests and screenings before boarding, everyone being required to wear masks or both of those things. I've made my decision not o fly until there's a vaccine available, even if it's not 100% effective."
"Masks or not, I'm with RojBlake on this one! Sadly seeing most of my family entails flying."
"We've booked a trip to Australia for February, hoping, obviously, that lockdown will have stopped being necessary and borders are open. I'm assuming there will be controls for flying, not least a temperature check before boarding. I'm assuming that mask wearing may be mandatory. I'm happy to fly then. But I'm not in a high risk group."
"I'm assuming there will be controls for flying, not least a temperature check before boarding. - That would be less than 100% effective as it wont catch those with the virus who are asymptomatic."
I meant that if it were only a temperature check it would at least be something. I expect there to be more controls though.
I am with those who feel that if they are going to have to expect to mask up and anitbac everything in sight in order to feel comfortably flying I am not going to bother any time soo.
"I will be visiting my children and grandchildren who, by then, I won't have seen for 14 months.... I would be more than happy to put up with whatever is considered required to be safe.What could be difficult if WA is still enforcing two weeks quarantine on arrival! But we will be there 6 weeks..."
"Everything can be said about the benefits of wearing masks and many things can also be said about the problems faced by wearing them. People are scared as of now and promote wearing them. Masks are clumsy, a little more difficult to breath and talk on your phone (which many have constantly glued to their face. ) I have yet to find a way to easily dine or even snack wearing a mask. Basically, as I understand, the majority of masks are actually for the protection of others and not yourself, All of that said, I believe what most of you have said to be what you believe, but let the scare die down and a very large portion of society will return to the 'old way'.If you disagree - just think- How many have picketed for return to work, beaches, regular restaurants, etc already? Wave your banners if you like, but the majority will push hard for return to what 'all was' prior to this epidemic and the masks wearers will be in the minority."
"It is difficult to enforce mask-wearing in public overall, but certainly airlines and retailers can and will enforce the use of them, at least for the time being. It's already been deemed mandatory at places like Costco and other retailers. No mask, no service. Of course you can choose to avoid patronizing all of these places, but those who do wish to use them will need to follow the rules. I understand why many are pushing to re-open things, especially so they can get back to work and earn money, but is going to the beach or being able to hang out in a bar really necessities? IMO, we are once again seeing too many people exhibiting the ME, ME, ME complex and showing no concern for the safety of others . Just look at the following thread about a TN woman who bragged about not taking the Covid-19 virus seriously. Karma is a B#$%h!https:/…"
"Here we all have to cover our mouth and nose when shopping or using public transport, some use a scarf others a mask. The exceptions are small children and asthma sufferers.Many shops have someone to check that you comply. So far I have done it so simplicity and not wanting to have to keep explaining myself , though as I have asthma I don't need to.However I might manage an hour flight with a mask a long one would not be possible and if we don't have to wear one then I can only imagine the aggro. from some other passengers !"
""" Basically, as I understand, the majority of masks are actually for the protection of others and not yourself, ""Nope, mask protects you- the wearer. I was reassigned to the COVID- ICU. We wear mask ( I use an N 95 followed by two other regular mask) to protect ourselves. Protecting others is essentially a secondary thing- especially if you are a known + case.+1 to Barbs. Having seen people die left and right, having to put breathing tubes in left and right, I really do not relish taking care of covidiots. I wonder if this pastor got into heaven. https:/…bishop-gerald-glenn-coronavirus.htmlAs Pogo said "" We have met the enemy and he is us. ""https:/…"
"bigwawoa..thank you for your service. I know the value of masks and I so agree with you. It is horribly sad you have to risk your life to care for covididiots, not right. Please stay well."
"bigwawoo - Yes, an N-95 and other high quality masks are for your protection, but the rank and file who are not in high care units have that snow-balls chance in Hell of procuring them. Perhaps at later times, but not there. Perhaps in New York City, but not in many other cities in the U S and the world. A piece of sewn broad cloth or a carpenter's mask is not the same. I will re affirm that most masks that are worn are for the protection of others, not yourself."
"Just got off a Delta round trip MKE-ATL-MKE. Most people masked. A couple of blowhards in first class did not have a mask and ran their mouths loudly on their cells before take off. May 4th masks will be required. Can't wait. It will be like fastening your seat belt--if you refuse, off you go. Diamond medallions do not have sterile breath. The shed bacteria and viruses just like the rest of us mere mortals in First class."
"calmjohn, it is good to disagree!So if it is worn for the protection of others, then if I test covid negative, it is ok for me to go out without a mask? When I go to a public place ( even with social distancing) I don't know who just coughed or sneezed a minute or two ago in the area I am just passing.Droplets stay in the air for a few minutes and aerosols even longer.So the mask is to protect me and secondarily to avoid or reduce droplets when one coughs or sneeze.Used to be the mask if to avoid spewing out the virus, especially if you are positive and not know it. That is no longer the main reason as the CDC says and I agree with them.No wonder it is not mandatory in NYS if you go out- cover up.https:/…cloth-face-cover.html"
bigwawaoI think that we are two learned individuals who could cite different approaches in different situations and both be 'considerable right' for as long as we cared to post on this thread or any other. You and I both know that CDC is not always 100% correct although they are an excellent resource.If I were in the mood for an exciting duel you would be an excellent opponent. As it is we can put our epees away and agree to disagree.
I found people in my neighborhood making masks through my NextDoor group and my neighborhood Facebook groups. if you have those they are a great resource for finding things right now. Also lots of dry cleaners are making basic ones.
"In Hong Kong, 99% of us have been wearing masks since the end of January. Despite being in a very small, crowded city of 7+ million, we have not had a mass outbreak. For the last two weeks, we have had *zero* homegrown cases reported. Throughout this period, most of us have been going to work using public transport. Restaurants remain open with some restrictions. A few high-risk establishments (cinemas, gyms, massage parlors, etc) are closed.Most of the cases now are from folks returning from foreign countries. The UK made up the biggest bulk, followed by the USA and then the rest of Europe. The latest two returnee cases came from Pakistan.Due to the asymtomatic nature of carriers, if most of the population wear masks, we are protecting each other. If just a few of us wear it, then masks probably aren't very useful. As to mask contamination, there is a gap between theory and practice. While a mask is easily contaminated in absolute medical terms, in real life, the contamination impact is negligible. If everyone is wearing a mask, there should be less of Covid-19 floating in the air to start. As long as your mask isn't contaminated by Covid-19, the contaminated mask won't be an issue.Most of us put on our mask when we leave home. We generally won't take it off unless we are with our trusted circle or back home. I wear one when I talk to my colleagues in the office. If I am flying on a plane, I most likely won't take it off until I reach my destination and get into my hotel or at the very least, my rental car.With all that said, I don't plan on flying any time soon even with a mask. It's too much of a risk at this point. For those who have to, I suggest you wear one."
"For the immediate future, I think the masks are good for both ways. Long term, they will never survive. The CDC initially said masks were ineffective, now they are good. hmm,,.As a nurse, Any coverage of your mouth and nose right now is good protection for all along with glasses, I also have a face shield over my mask should I go to a heavily populated area like a grocery store. Masks can be only effective as the user, same for gloves. I am not suing gloves often, hand washing and hand sanitizer are my go to's. Gloves are contaminated so quickly and give a false sense of security and again only as good as the user. Thank goodness all those years and money I paid for education are paying off I know how to wash my hands properly, use a mask and gloves properly and feel quite comfortable in them LOL.It is the newest job here in Mexico. Wonder if it will become a fashion statement if so I will need many masks. Okay, laugh!"
"The talk in the UK about wearing masks does come form a different angle. All our 'experts' are saying mask wearing is to protect others primarily. If everyone wears one, they are protecting others and themselves.Since you may not know you have the virus, you're still protecting others by wearing your mask.It's a bit chicken and egg isn't it? Glass half full/half empty. The result will be the same, which is all that matters."
"I think many people focus too much on the research which finds that a surgical mask is more effective in stopping virus dispensed by the wearer and less effective in stopping the smallest droplets from reaching the mask wearer. I have heard many ""experts"" citing as the reason that a surgical mask protects others but not the wearer.I have no reason to not believe a surgical mask (the one you can buy from a drug store) is more effective in blocking the virus going one way from the wearer to the other side of the mask, but people need to understand ""less effective"" does not mean no effect at all in stopping the droplets coming from the outside, especially the larger droplets. Droplets come in different sizes, I think there is value in blocking or deflecting some of them. May be that is all one needs during a brief encounter of those droplets, such as walking by someone who is coughing in his elbow.Another benefit of wearing a mask is peer pressure on others who may have the virus to also wear a mask. Say you don't think you have the virus, but how do you encourage the other person who may to wear a mask so that you are protected from him/her? You wear your mask so that they feel obligated to wear theirs. If everyone is wearing a mask, then everyone is protected somewhat without worrying about who may or may not have the virus.Now, it is true that N95 masks are designed and more effective in protecting the wearer. There is no question that the world can be in a better place if everyone wears a N95 mask. An issue is that we don't currently have enough N95 masks for everyone. Until we do, a surgical mask is the next best option. And for those who cannot even find a surgical mask to buy, any mask or face covering is better than nothing.For those who doubt whether wearing a surgical mask is good for them, just watch and listen to the hospital workers, not those ""experts"" who seems to live in ivory towers. If surgical masks are really useless and only protect others, then why are all hospital workers wear them and in desperate need for more? Are the hospital workers all sick and want to avoid spreading the virus to Covid-19 patients? Not the other way aroundCan those ""experts"" not explain to the medical professionals that they don't need masks unless they are sick? I would love to see that debate on TV."
"""How many have picketed for return to work, beaches, regular restaurants, etc already?""In the grand scheme of things, given the millions that have been affected in one way or another, very very few are picketing. Yes they are loud, yes they are getting coverage (because the news networks are like that), but I doubt that they are even close to a majority."
"I have just stood in a queue outside the bank behind a lady wearing gloves and a N95 mask. We had to wait for about 15 minutes. During that time, she adjusted her mask with her gloved hands, ran her fingers through her hair and still with gloved hands, scratched or rubbed her face just below her eyes. She also had bank cards and a cheque book in a plastic wallet. I assume she took them out of the wallet, still wearing the gloves, when she got inside.No sign of hand wipes or hand gel, and did she get back in her car still wearing those gloves?I don’t like to contemplate how she removed and disposed of the gloves, Nor how often she will remove and re-use that mask.Until people understand how wrong this is and how important it is to use protective equipment properly, masks and gloves are not going to be the answer. Giving people a false sense of security is potentially more risky."
"Wearing masks is like hand washing. It's not 100% effective unless everyone does it. As long as no one is coughing with their masks off, you're fine to eat and drink provided you've washed your hands after handling the tray table and armrests. I don't believe that every plane is sanitized before every flight."
"<< I don’t like to contemplate how she removed and disposed of the gloves, Nor how often she will remove and re-use that mask. >>An employee from our local supermarket posted on our neighborhood forum that when he goes to retrieve the carts, he is finding masks and gloves in the carts or lying in the parking lot. Would you want to be picking up after these inconsiderate slobs? They wear masks and gloves and then dispose of them improperly. I keep bags in my car to properly place the items in and then discard in my trash at home. Removal is always followed by hand sanitizer and anything I touched in/on the car gets wiped down.All this only takes a few minutes. Apparently that's too much to ask of some people."
"Hi,Any asthma sufferers in here? I may be on a long-haul flight (12hours) and I find it difficult to imagine all that time with a mask, not being able to stand and stretch, walk... :(Any experiences?"
"While I can see why asthma sufferers or anyone with sever allergies would have an issue with a mask, I'm not sure where the not being able to stand and stretch, walk comes in. Even in normal times this can be difficult to do, but i haven't seen anything saying people will be confined to their seats for an entire flight, unless using the restrooms. I would expect though that you would be required to have a mask on when moving past others via the aisle."
"My parents used to fly quite a bit and had multiple incidents with turbulence. They taught me to stay seated as much as possible and wear a seat belt. I also have had turbulence experience and even encourage seatmates to wear seat belts - I don't want them landing on me. You can do stretches, ankle wiggles, etc. in your seat to help out. The experts are advising folks not to walk around in the plane to maintain social distancing. Even food and drink distribution is limited so that the flight crew isn't going up and down the aisles.The CDC actually recommends folks with asthma to avoid air travel unless it is essential. Here's some info from the world famous National Jewish Hospital in Denver - https:/…covid-19-and-asthma"
"The severity of asthma might determine whether the person can wear a mask. My companion has a mild form that becomes severe occasionally. She usually has no real problems on the plane though. However, asthma sufferers might react to a Covid-19 infection more severely. From that perspective, they might not wish to travel yet.Remember to wear the medical type mask, not N95. N95 is going to make it even harder to breathe while providing no real additional protection without proper fitting."
"Exactly Susie. Stay seated, belt fastened. Every year people are injured seriously, even killed, when turbulence occurs unexpectedly. But it doesn't seem to apply to the Easyjet/Ryanair passengers?"
"It is important to take at least one walk on a long haul flight to avoid blood clots in your legs, per medical professionalsWould love to see stats on deaths and injuries from turbulence"
"https:/…Here's one example, there are plenty more.Going to the toilet on a long haul flight satisfies the need to get out of your seat at least once."
"I agree about the need to walk about being overstated - you can do regular exercises to keep the blood flow in your legs working without leaving your seat and if you are prone to DVT related issues I would say that as well as always wearing compression stockings you should also be questioning where you really NEED to fly long haul at all .Edited: 5:30 am, June 12, 2020 "
"Anecdotes aren’t stats. I don’t deny turbulence is an issue, but I would love to see it quantified."
"I can only speak for myself, but I don't want to walk around when there's turbulence. I find it uncomfortable enough sitting down. And I don' want other people falling on to me when they lose their balance when the aircraft is bouncing about.I had asthma as a child but grew out of it. Nonetheless, wearing anything over my nose and mouth brings back memories of struggling to breathe. I can't even put a scarf over my face in winter. I'm also in a vulnerable group.So I won't fly until such time as I think it will be safe and pleasant enough for me to do so. At the moment, I don't think it's worth the risk or the hassle."
"Northern, a Google search can easily bring you the stats that you want. My take is that if you wander the aisle and fall on someone when you should have been seated you might just find yourself in the middle of a lawsuit. We live in a litigious society. Your rights end when they harm others."
"Interesting take. I'm not sure a court would blame someone who fell over due to turbulence for the injury.Can you find a case of this happening on Google? I sure couldn't in a quick searchI agree we are in a litigious society, but this is not the topic in question here and nowEdited: 11:59 am, June 12, 2020 "
"When the seat belt sign is on, you're supposed to be in your seat with your seat belt fastened, which would include when the pilot detects turbulence. However, we all know that turbulence can happen suddenly, which is why it is requested you always keep your seat belt on when seated. Many of those who are injured during turbulence are hurt because they don't have their seat belt on and are thrown upward and outwards. If sudden turbulence hits while people are in the aisle and with no seat belt sign on, certainly it is possible that they could fall on someone, but to sue them for an unintentional act? People do need to get up and use the restroom afterall. Sorry, but my first instinct would be to make sure that I and and the other person are OK, not getting their personal info so I could be calling my lawyer."
"If you aren’t going somewhere for work just stay home. You aren’t traveling anymore. That kind of behavior is highly irresponsible, and you should not be part of the problem. Isolationism is the new way. Get to know to your own city/town/neighborhood because that’s what you’ve got going forward. Recreational travel is not part of your future. Accept it and move on to something else that you enjoy."
"Since tourism brings in millions for most countries, I very much doubt that will ever work."
“ Recreational travel is not part of your future. Accept it and move on....”Where is your evidence please? And are you really suggesting that those of us whose family is scattered around the world will never be able to see them again? What a dismal and unsupported prediction.
It’s not a prediction & there is absolutely zero evidence this is how things will go. In fact I fully expect a planet of irresponsible people to continue being irresponsible moving forward. Those who continue to behave as we have in the past certainly have the right to do so. Personally I just think continuing on in that fashion is an absolutely horrible idea. I also don’t expect anyone to agree with or abide by anything my personal opinions.
"Really? I’m not supposed to be doing recreational travel. I guess I should cancel my trip later this month because someone on here has spoken and said no you cannot travel. I don’t think so.Yes people I am going to get on a plane for a family visit no I’m not terrified,no I’m not living in fear, I will wear a mask I will be responsible person. I will wear a mask, our use hand sanitizer, I will wash my hands, I will do the precautionsBut I Have flown enough and read enough to know that the airplane any more dangerous than any place else I have to go, like the grocery store. And statistically it’s a lot safer than driving."
Anyone else struck by the irony of someone (Sidestepblue) now advocating isolationism yet only a couple of months ago planning to head off on a spur of the moment trip to Rwanda! Incidentally just about the time President Trump Declared a national emergency.
I saw that bestcornish and left a reply on that post....
"You should do what you want to do. My opinion and decisions are not going to be popular and that is ok with me. I will do what I think is best and you will do what you think is best. It’s likely I won’t agree with the behaviors that you choose to practice, and you will likely think that my behaviors are an overreaction. In reality my view point doesn’t change what will happen as I have no control over how things will be in the future (which is likely a good thing for the rest of you).Also my opinion really has nothing to do with the current pandemic. Sure it was formed because of the pandemic, but that’s not what is spurring my change of opinions. After living the pandemic lifestyle for the last few months I find that it’s just a better way to live. It’s simplified everything down to base needs, which really is what life is all about."
That is in fact true I was planning a spur of the moment trip to Africa. In fact I used to go abroad about 4 times a year. I’ve just simply changed my opinion about what is right for the world moving forward. People’s opinions change over time and that really shouldn’t be a problem. I certainly wouldn’t want to have the same opinions and desires for my entire life.
"I think the last few months has given us all a chance to re-evaluate the true cost of a lifestyle we previously took for granted. In that respect a tiny virus has exceeded anything that Greta Thunberg could possibly have achieved and demonstrated that token protests are insignificant compared with what nature and the planet can do.Sidestepblue, you have been open-minded enough to change your mind, and honest enough to say so. It's not peddling doom and gloom, it's facing up to a new reality. Others can still make up their minds on the relative risks of travel, to themselves and others, but there are going to be some much more difficult decisions about where we all go from here."
I expect I will see my family members across the country. The alternative doesn’t seem feasible to me
"<< You aren’t traveling anymore. That kind of behavior is highly irresponsible, and you should not be part of the problem. Isolationism is the new way. >>Everyone has the choice of traveling now or in the future, so it is ridiculous for someone to come on this forum and make the decree that people won't and shouldn't be traveling. People have to travel for business, see family, and just broaden their horizons. Right now there is great concern over the mental health of people who have been forced to isolate for such long periods. Most of us just aren't used to living that way, but maybe sidestep you are quite happy to do so and that's fine.Additionally, as has already been pointed out, tourism is a big part of the economy , not just in other countries, but in so many towns here in the US. So sidestep, are you ready to accept responsibility that millions of businesses that rely on tourism would just shutdown if people were to follow your directive? How will people earn a living? Maybe your are not employed in a business that revolves around tourism, so your livelihood won't directly be affected, and therefore you just don't care about how ""no travel"" would impact others. Even when you are out and about in ""your own city/town/neighborhood "" you should be practicing social distancing and the CDC guidelines, which includes wearing masks. Is everyone in Ann Arbor doing this so you can have a virus-free zone? It's just not going to happen, no matter how many warnings, advisories, etc. are issued by health organizations. Some people only care about themselves and what they want to do. I don't see that ever changing.If you want to stay home and isolate, that is your prerogative but let everyone make their own decisions. I don't agree that ""isolationism is the new way"" and I certainly don't intend to live that way."
"I've just done some maths and taking the statistics for 2018 in the UK, there were 616,014 deaths.From the stats I could find online, there were 138,916 deaths in the UK in the first 12 weeks of 2020. If you use that figure to estimate the total number of deaths this year, it comes to 601,969.Interestingly, that's 15,000 less than 2018.It will be somewhat ironic, if our total number of deaths this year is similar to the number of deaths in 2018. (2019 figures weren't available).Perhaps, we should have carried on as normal but encouraged the vulnerable, whatever their age or condition to self isolate/quarantine while the virus was rife."
I suspect isolationism might be easier to adopt/suggest if you’ve been lucky enough to travel extensively and/or if you live somewhere nice . Others are not so fortunate.
"<< Perhaps, we should have carried on as normal but encouraged the vulnerable, whatever their age or condition to self isolate/quarantine while the virus was rife. >>Didn't Sweden do basically that?"
"They did, and whilst life went on pretty much as normal, they've had similarly high numbers of deaths. I'm not sure if they're proportionally higher than ours.I guess many people wouldn't have been happy with that approach and would have blamed our government for putting economics first. As it is, we've trashed the economy and had a high number of deaths....Lose, lose, instead of win, win."
"Same situation in the US Bella, but going to avoid starting a political discussion that will get shutdown anyways."
"Good idea BarbP, I just felt a bit glum today.... best not to upset anyone."
"It is my opinion that to each his own. Sidestep- if you have decided that you are more comfortable staying home and isolated.....good for you. If that is what makes you happy and at peace. For me, I personally love to travel. It makes me happy and at peace when I can discover new parts of the world. It makes me happy and at peace when I travel and I can feel my inner self being changed by what I am seeing/learning/feeling while on vacation and discovering a new place and a new culture. This world is HUGE, and to me it would be so sad if everyone just decided to stay around their own little town and never get out and broaden their horizons. I wear a mask in the grocery store. I use hand sanitizer as I am leaving and walking to my car. I wash my hands the minute I get home. I take the virus seriously, but I am not going to let it paralyze me with fear. I will take the exact same precautions when traveling and making myself happy. To me, there is WAY more to life then going to work and hibernating in my own house. I love in Michigan, too. About 1.5 hours from Ann Arbor and to me there just isn't to many places here that I have the urge to explore. I guess the bottom line is....let everyone make their own decisions and let's not condemn those like me who are dying to travel agin!Stay safe!Edited: 12:01 pm, June 14, 2020 "
Well said!
"Debbie T, I too love to travel. It makes me happy, broadens my horizons, all the same things that you enjoy. If I want to sit by the pool and chill, I can do that perfectly well at home, I don't need to travel to an exotic location. I'm gutted that there is no realistic prospect of me going anywhere this year. But there are thousands if not millions of us who want to do the same, and our wish to travel impacts on other people and our planet. We are lucky to enjoy the income and opportunity to do so, but it doesn't give us some God given right to indulge our wishes just because we can.The earlier post commented on how the lockdown had given us all a chance to reflect on what is truly important in our lives, and to adjust our priorities. Your post is all about what you want to do, what you expect from your travel and how you will ensure your own safety as far as possible. It's time we all started to be a little less selfish."
"<< It's time we all started to be a little less selfish.>>I think that shipped sailed long ago. All one has to do is watch the media reports to see that those who are self-centered will continue to be so and no health warnings are going to stop them. For how many decades has there been warnings about the hazardous affects of smoking, and legislation to prohibit smoking in buildings and public areas, but people still do it? All we can do is what is right for ourselves and hopefully those around us, but there is no way to force people to take responsible actions now anymore than there has been in the past. Unfortunate, but that's the reality."
"I feel the same way as Neapolitano in that I love to travel, but not at the moment, because I would find no inner peace nor enjoyment worrying about the virus and m,y increased susceptibility to it.I'm also gutted that the virus came along and has ruined this year, travel wise. I made my own decision not to travel internationally a while back, and I'm comfortable with it even though I do still wish that circumstances were different.I don't disagree that we can and should all make our own decisions, but I also agree that if we are going to travel, we need to be sensible about where we go and what precautions we take. That's especially the case when it comes to flying as far as I'm concerned."
"'If you aren’t going somewhere for work just stay home. You aren’t traveling anymore. That kind of behavior is highly irresponsible, and you should not be part of the problem. Isolationism is the new way. Get to know to your own city/town/neighborhood because that’s what you’ve got going forward. Recreational travel is not part of your future. Accept it and move on to something else that you enjoy.' One of the funniest posts of the month. Compelled speech is one thing but compelled activities of daily living is ludicrous.Sidestepblue's views are his own, but he doesn't make decisions for anyone else. To claim 'isolationism is the new way' is valid only if sidestepblue has expertise in virology and epidemiology, which I suspect he does not.With regards to travel, universal precautions and physical distancing when possible should remain in place in the short term (at least for the next three or four months) to reduce but not eliminate the risk. Putting the brakes on life may be in your long term plan but it is not in mine (although I will continue physical distancing and scrupulous handwashing for the foreseeable future)."
"Well when the Travel Advice is lifted by the foreign office and aircraft are starting to upscale their schedules i’ll be all over it like a rash. We travel to Asia/ SE Asia for a winter break most January to March and I’m probably 80% confident we will be doing it again this winter. The plan is to wait until the end of August/ September and look how things are around the world with the virus and then hopefully book a flight from England to India and then a few internal flights nearer the time, if not India then SE Asia somewhere. This is also dependant on being able to obtain travel insurance but if travel is proceeding then that will be possible. The virus is rapidly in retreat in many areas of the World, the strength of the virus in new cases now bears no resemblance to its veracity a few months ago...it’s weakening. There have been no second waves anywhere, some spikes but no second wave, virologists are apparently quietly confident we won’t see one. If there isn’t a vaccination then suitable medication will come on board which will reduce the risk to the majority of the public, that is more or less guaranteed. Wearing a mask in places where social distancing isn’t possible isn’t that big a deal, anyway I believe a one metre distance will soon be the norm which is very manageable in most settings. So it’s a glass half full for me, I’m confident that in the next six months or even less we’ll be getting on with our life’s again and I’ll be buying mossie spray and sun cream. I apologise in advance if this post is too positive for some."

We all know that China didn't have a good track record for containing the virus the first time around. Not all health officials are sharing your optimistic views about there being no second wave. How many cases constitutes a spike versus a second wave, as here in the US we just had an increase of almost 26000 cases yesterday?"
"I'm concerned about the latest outbreak in China, and I'm also concerned that covid-19 will mutate at some point into something even more dangerous.But at the moment, I feel that the signs are better than have been for several months, at least here in Europe."

"https:/…international-travel.htmlAs far as I know, the US Dept of State and CDC sill advise against non-essential intl travel.As far as masks are concerned, my understanding is they are considered optional by most airlines -- any rules regarding their use are usually not being enforced, even when other passengers complain, the airlines taking the position that it's not a law and they can't force someone or throw them off the plane if they refuse.I think the point of the mask is to contain possibly infected breath/droplets when it is most likely to pose threat to others--when coughing, sneezing or talking in animated fashion. Several of the early clusters in US have been traced to group gatherings where people were talking close together in group settings for more than 15 minutes -- conventions, company conferences, a 50th birthday party, a funeral. I don't think just taking a mask off to eat or drink falls into one of those categories. And I assume the airline will be pleased you are even wearing a mask. (And note that, depending on length of your flight, you may be served little or nothing, certainly less than you are likely accustomed to).On the plane I would be wary of any loudmouth nearby passengers -- the kind who have a drink or two then spend the rest of the flight yackyack yacking to their travel companion(s)."
"Neopolitano- I am sorry you took my post as me being selfish. I can assure you I am not. What I was trying to convey is who are we to judge other people by their choice to isolate or travel? Every person has the right to make decisions that best suit them. Life is so very short, we need to make the best of it. I make no apologies that I enjoy traveling and miss it and look forward to doing it again. Just as people who have discovered that they are happy to stay home shouldn’t apologize. Assuming that I don’t care about the safety and health of others or the planet because I listed some reasons why I love to travel is a little obtuse wouldn’t you say?"
"<< No you’re wrong thats a spike in Beijing , in a isolated location. >>The largest food market in Asia in China's capital city of over 20M people is an isolated location? Cases have already spread to a neighboring province. How can we honestly believe that the number of cases reported are accurate after China mislead the world regarding the virus right from the start?

But isn’t that part of the reason for contributing to a forum, to give your own thoughts and point of view?"
"Debbie T, My comment about selfishness was directed at all of us, myself included. I'm relatively relaxed about the risk of infection though, and I too am hoping that travel may become possible sooner rather than later. But I think it is inevitable that the freedom to travel widely and relatively cheaply will not be an option for some time yet, and the damage done to airlines, travel operators, hotels and tourist attractions means that it will be limited either by reduced capacity or increased costs or both.Set against the number of livelihoods that will be badly affected by the financial fallout, my desire to travel seems pretty trivial to me, much as I might want things to go back to normal. I'm more than willing to travel if it helps to restore the local economy of my favourite destinations, but that's easy for me to say from a position of relative privilege.Lockdown has given me time to reassess my priorities, and to realise that very often, less is more.Edited: 4:59 pm, June 14, 2020 "
"Maybe people who want to travel because they can't stand being isolated where they live now should consider just moving to someplace more interesting. And some of the current situations don't sound like they bode well for the future (like old age).Personally, I am not too eager to travel long haul right now because I have heard too many horror stories about the after effects of this disease for people who survive it. I think I am less concerned about getting it and dying than about getting it and surviving it and having to hobble through what's left of my life with damaged organs and in need of ongoing monitoring and care (and likely no travel). So, for now at least, I'm going to let the adventurers out there pack themselves into planes with hundreds of strangers and see how they fare before I expose myself to any more risk.Edited: 2:57 am, June 15, 2020 "
"No I pulled mine down for 45 minutes I ate very slow so I didn’t have to wear the stupid useless mask. The air is circulating round the plane so if you are worried about covid stay at home, as you will catch it. Impossible not too we are like sardines in a tin, no 2m distance at all crammed in, germs all over the place, so take your mask off it won’t save you."
so take your mask off it won’t save you. - The point is that wearing a mask reduces the risk of you infecting others but due to selfish people like yourself the virus will have plenty of opportunities to spread
"I understand that this is a travel forum, not an opinion forum. If everyone agrees with that, then let those of us who plan to travel discuss safer ways to travel and those who have decided not to travel find a forum that is not about travel, but on home repair or how to plant a better garden."
"Those of us who have chosen not to travel keep coming back in the hope that those who are still doing so can convince us that people are behaving sensibly, the precautions in airports, hotels and resorts are adequate, and that we have some hope of resuming a more normal life.Home repairs and gardening are a poor substitute. We can only get our travel fix vicariously by coming here!"

#141 I think that you and I both enjoy living and the very good things in life. A great and enjoyable time for home and travel to refresh our souls.
"I have to admit my husband and I are getting a bit antsy, as we had 4 trips of 10-15 days each planned this year and like so many others have had to forgo 3 out of the 4, along with some 2-3 day trips. . We got the first one in in early February, before Covid-19 became the mess it now is. The other 3 trips have now been move to next year so I will do my part by wearing a mask, washing my hands frequently , and using hand sanitizer. I'd like t stay healthy enough to actually take these trips next year, especially since they have all already been paid for!"
"My husband has categorically said that he is not flying anywhere unnecessarily (that means holidays) until there is an effective vaccine ! No if, and no buts - he is fine with me going away on my own or with friends if i am prepared ot , but if I do, then I will be self-isolating for 14 days somewhere other than in our home!Edited: 6:07 pm, yesterday "
Yes this is what I am wondering even now that it'sSeptember tomorrow. Does any body know if this is the case now? I am assuming you can take the mask of while eating and staying seated but then what happens if your sitting next to a stranger on a plane or have planes got to take a cirtain amount of passangers to keep people at a distance but then the s situation with the passangers on the flight that had Corid 19 and those that said people were not sticking to safety measures this is all becoming a farce any one who really knows the plan or am I to intelligent that know one can answer?
"""or am I to intelligent""---Say what? You might want to run your post by us again."

"Just did 4 flights on UA.Everyone in masks, except when eating and drinking.All gate staff in masks.Reviews in the works, and will be posted very soon, with photos.Hunt"
"As far as “strangers,” I was luck to be next to my wife, with no strangers next to me.Fly safely,Hunt"
"Personally, I don't think a plane is too dangerous *if* everyone stays in their masks as much as possible. So far, I have heard very few cases of flight attendants picking up the disease.However, the route matters. Certain countries aren't doing so great when it comes to controlling the disease. I wouldn't fly those routes since one could pick up the bug while visiting or face a much higher risk if sitting in a plane with numerous infected passengers.There might never be a 100% vaccine. However, the virus could mutate to become weaker so it will be more flu-like. We just have to live and hope.@Hunt: I haven't seen you here for a while so I was wondering if you stopped flying! Good to see you again."
"Had my first flight last week since the pandemic started. Mine on American and like Hunt it was a mostly good experience. Everyone around me on the plane had masks except when eating. The staff wore them. Gate agents wore them. The flight itself was packed.Went through ORD and SEA and both airports were very empty. The only place there was a bit of a crowd was the food court at ORD. Otherwise it was easy to socially distance. There were a few people in the airport sitting at gates not wearing masks or with them not on properly, but it was so empty it was easy to distance from them."
"A Tui flight from Zante to Cardiff has had at least 16 people infected with Covid after their return flight. People on the plane have told the media that lots of people on the plane were not wearing masks....and neither were staff, nor were they enforcing people to wear one."
"It must depend on the airline.EasyJet were most definitely enforcing mask wearing at the gate and on the flight last weekend.They specifically mentioned (over and over) masks had to cover nose and mouthI was in 4C, chap in 4A removed his mask to order his coffee and snacks and was told firmly to put his mask back on unless he was actually taking a drink or eating.Airports either end of my journey were enforcing mask wearing too although they were more strict at HER than EDI"
