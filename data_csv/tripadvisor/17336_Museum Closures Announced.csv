Cambodia announces closure of museums.Details here:https:/â€¦Best regards. Ian
"This should have been done last week but at least its official. Closing more and more tourist sights, cinemas, KTV establishments, etc. shows the Cambodian people this is a serious epidemic."
"Hello Richard,Cambodia seems to be contradicting itself in some ways, what with very few tourists ensuring an automatic distancing of each other at popular sites now ordered closed.Yet, since the arrival of several hundred shipping containers with raw materials for the TCF - Textile, Clothing and Footwear factories each employing thousands of employees, all in close proximity to each other for long hours returning to work, how long before Corvid -19 sweeps though one of these mega-factories I wonder? My young friend at the Chinese owned and operated Jun Huoy Factory at Khan Chbar Ampov 2, about 10 km from the centre of Phnom Penh, is temporarily back at work and working from 07:00am to 7 PM six days a week.Cambodia is in a real bind. The government desperately needs the one hard international currency, the USD$, that used to come from visa fees and Angkor tickets - but which now evaporated. In addition, international payments in USD$ for exports from the TCF factories now drying up too because of partial suspension of the EBA arrangement with the European Union. And, of course, the USA is poised to remove in whole or part the GSP.And yet, the very expensive joint military manoeuvers with China in Cambodia are proceeding. Obviously they can't afford to upset China and presumably Chinese and Cambodia soldiers don't catch Corvid-19. This money would be far better spent on public health measures and facilities.Best regards. Ian"
