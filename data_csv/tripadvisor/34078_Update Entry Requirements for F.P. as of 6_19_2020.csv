"Tahiti Tourisme updated their website last night. If this is info has already been posted, please disregard. It clarifies the 72 hour testing requirement, medical health form, an amendment to the previous travel insurance statement, etc. The link is below. Hope this further helps some with planning their trip.https://tahititourisme.com/en-us/covid-19/"
Thanks for posting cupcake. I called you cupcake because thats your screename. I am not trying to be mysoginistic as a disclaimer to a certain poster here. This is heavy sarcasm btw.
Thank you for posting Cupcake.
It looks like they removed the immunity /antibody certificate. I’m sure that was there before.
"Andrew F, cupcake is actually one of my nicknames, so you're good lol :-)Yesh24, you're right. On their earlier updates they had a blurb about requiring a medical certificate, but also had the disclaimer that more details would be provided soon. I think the form that they reference is what will act as the medical certificate. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong though.I'm inching closer to getting on a plane! 41 days and counting...."
Thanks for this updated info. Looks like we may be able to make our trip in early September...hopefully :)
Im 45 and a wakeup!
Any idea how to get the covid test results back within 72 hours of being tested? Many places take a week for results of the test to come back.
"Dennis S,I Googled ""same day results, covid-19 rt pcr test in (state)"" and was able to find a few clinics. I had to sort through a lot of random results but I eventually hit the jackpot. I stayed away from my insurance provider and CVS/Walgreens and instead focused on private clinics that accept my insurance instead. They are out there, apparently. Which is good for those of us who are willing to try to go within the next month or so. Good luck!"
"Andrew F,Prior military? (xx days and a wake up?) You triggered me slightly LOL (Army vet! 92A and then 42A). If not, disregard:-) What island(s) are you/yall headed to?"
"Scoshi,By September all the kinks (if any) will be ironed out; you're going to go on your trip and you will have a GREAT time :-)"
"Yes USAF!Cupcake I would also say that we are both getting short!I will be in Bora Bora. Cant wait....Edited: 9:00 am, June 21, 2020 "
"Andrew,My parents are USAF vets :-) Oooooh my Maupiti flight leg was cancelled so I'm trying to decide if I want to go to Bora Bora or Huahine instead, or try to find another travel method to Maupiti since I already have lodging arranged there....decisions decisions...."
"The ""medical form"" they are asking for is just a questionnaire you sign. It is a formality as no one can validate the information on it. Giving them a copy of a negative test is more problematic as many Americans cannot get results within 72 hours. My trip is in January so by then this requirement may have been eased up once FP sees that Americans cannot get their test results so fast and they are not coming. A request to ease up o the 72 hour testing will come from the 2 airlines that fly from the US, ATN and UA, if booked pax are cancelling tickets due to lack of the timely test result requirement. It will also come from Windstar as most of their pax are from the US and if they are cancelling their cruises because of the test requirement Windstar would also be asking the FP government to lighten up."
"Susiesan1 is right; we need to make our opinions heard through the airlines. They are are the ones in touch with the government regulators developing these regulations, and are the most motivated to ensure they are feasible."
"I still don't really understand the medical insurance part of this. Are they asking for people to have travel insurance specific to COVID19. If so, how do you get that? And how expensive is it?Or does just having normal health insurance take care of this?Edited: 11:06 pm, June 21, 2020 "
"Andrew and Cupcake, thank you both for your service! <3"
My military travels is what got me into exploring our world. I was happy to serve. Best decision ever other than marrying my wife.
"Thanks Michelle!!! #GoArmy :-)Allie, the way I read the official notice is that you either have insurance that covers any potential Covid-related illness or treatment OR be prepared to pay all costs out of pocket:Have a travel insurance covering Covid-19 expenses OR assume all expenses related to my medical expenses including hospitalization, confinement, or repatriation such as in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection during my stay.The previous notice only mentioned having travel insurance. This new update gives you an option. Allianz travel insurance for about $360 has Covid illness and treatment built into the price. That's what I purchased back in December before things became interesting....Edited: 4:46 pm, June 22, 2020 "
Any idea if the chase sapphire reserve card travel insurance would cover these costs if they came up?
"Dennis,I'm no expert, but I have the same card and I'm sure you're aware of the range of the credit limit that can be available for owning it....I'd take a gamble and say that if for some reason you had to get treated for Covid while on vacation, your card would be able to allow you to make payment(s) for treatment with no issue. But again, I'm no expert. If you're concerned about becoming ill on the trip, I'd just Google the estimated out of pocket expenses associated with covid treatment and then plan accordingly. Me? When I show them my negative test prior to boarding, that's the last I'm going to think of Covid until I return to the States. :-)"
"Cupcakelovah,Thanks for the information. I am trying to keep my stress levels down with these new guidelines/requirements. I don't expect to have to worry about Covid, but just trying to prepare to be on the safe side. I definitely don't want to have to pay another $1,000+ in trip insurance for my wife and I. I've commented in other threads, but we are still trying to get some guarantees around rapid Covid genome testing (RT-PCR) within 100 miles. This has been very difficult to find, even in talkswith our medical physicians. It might just be our area (North Houston). What's tough for us is we fly out on a Tuesday (8/25); so we need to be tested on the Saturday before(8/22). Is anyone else finding the 72 hour testing turnaround time difficult to swing? Thanks!"
"Dennis,I know it's kind of stressful working on the what ifs when we ALL should just be counting down the days and repacking instead. My 72 hr window is slightly different from yours. I fly on a Friday morning, so I can go and get tested on Thursday afternoon at a rapid clinic that provides 30 minute results. For clinics, try searching for ""Abbott tests, covid rt pcr, (state)."" I found an urgent care clinic in my state that provides results in minutes, but I need a physician referral. I have a video meeting set up with my GP tomorrow. I'll provide an update to this post to detail what happened. Your best bet right now is to dig deep and make the Google searchbar your BFF...find a rapid test clinic....get a referral from your doctor....wear your mask diligently until you step onto a beach. Positive thoughts only! :-)"
"You may even have to do some driving. The 2 locations in my state that offer the test (with same day results) are 1.5 hours away. Yes, I'm going to make the drive. Because I want to go on my trip, dammit lol"
Do you know the specific about the 72 testing before departure? Does that mean I have to get my results within 72 hours of leaving or does the initial test have to be done within 72 hours? Most places still have a three day turn around so Im a little worried
"Dennis, the coverage on the Chase sapphire reserve card will not cover medical expenses. I was looking through this very very closely last week. There is coverage to help ONLY with prepaid travel expenses up to $10k per person and $20k per trip. But it won't cover any medical costs at all, zero. They will help you coordinate travel and medical needs but specifically state that you are responsible for all costs. If you are quarantined by the government or a medical physician this coverage is in place and can help with any resort or flight expenses that you already paid for that are non-refundable. If you choose not to travel due to pandemic or epidemic that coverage is specifically excluded. But really, reading over the causes listed that would relate to COVID would mainly be if you are under mandatory quarantine or if you are hospitalized due to being sick. Other than those the coverage really doesn't help much and you would be liable for all costs.There is a PDF you can get from the Chase website that has all the specifics laid out for what is covered with the credit card. You also of course have to pay for a portion of the trip using the card for there to be any coverage."
"Anna, the test has to be administered in that 72 hour frame. They recommend trying to do it as close to the 72 hour mark as possible to increase your chances of getting results in time.Edited: 7:11 pm, June 22, 2020 "
"Cupcake, we have Allianz travel insurance for our cancelled April cruise, and it was passed on for our rescheduled January trip. They have specific language in their contract that exempted pandemics from coverage. We have other medical coverage that we pay that covers us for hospitalization up to 25,000 dollars outside the US, and another that pays fa very generous amount for evacuation to the US.Being from the East Coast of the US (on the West Coast of Florida), we don't feel comfortable with the 72 hour negative test result to enter FP. Many people in Florida are looking to go to the Bahamas as they are about to reopen to tourists. They had a 5 day negative result needed, but no one was able to get written proof of a negative result to submit to them. Positive results were being reported by e-mail within 24 hours, but negative results were being sent via regular mail. Who knows how long that will take. After many complaints, the Bahamas extended the time for a negative result qualifying as proof.That leaves us thinking how we would get that negative test proof if we had the test here in Florida, and make it to LAX to board Air Tahiti Nui. If the Bahamas bound posters are correct, that can't happen. ATN has local sites in the LA area to be tested. Are they reporting negative test results faster? Would I need to stay in LA a longer amount of time than I want to if I wait to be tested there? Will I catch Covid19 (or something else contagious) on the plane to LAX, and have a fever by the time I arrive in PPT? And what would happen at that point? If we lived in California, we would feel much more comfortable about going to PPT from LAX, but having the travel time to get to LAX doesn't make us comfortable about going before there's a vaccine."
"Hi All, I called Air Tahiti Nui today and asked them about the PCR test vs Rapid test. As you would expect they just keep referring back to their company website, but the lady did mention that the result certificate should state 'RT-PCR test'. It seems like details still need to be fleshed out, but it maybe prudent to double check with your testing site regarding to this. Our flight is on late July, fingers crossed..."
I called ATN today and the rep I spoke with was marginally helpful. (Its hit or miss with the reps I have found)She and I discussed having my test done here in Abq. Catch is my provider here will not give me a written letter. Only a message on my chart online showing negative or positive. So the ATN rep said I need to go to the one by LAX. But that is a 48 hour test. I fly in same day I fly out.Such a conundrum right now. Hopefully things are changed to be a bit easier on us.
"Swflaok,Good info. Im going to dig out my Allianz insurance. I recall receiving an email saying blah blah normally pandemics arent covered BUT there's an exception due to this new development....I'll have to find the email and then re-read my insurance plan. From what you say, seems like it may be a fluff document I'm currently sitting on.I read the other posts, good discussions! I'm going to ask my GP about the documentation of results tomorrow during my video chat....."
"Andrew, why do you need a written letter from your doctor? The Tahiti site only says to show negative results upon check in....so couldn't that mean you could print out your medical chart, and show the negative response and the date of the test? I'm just wondering since Tahiti Tourism's info on that part seems vague (to me)....I'll ask about that tomorrow as well...."
Do you think an email will be enough?
The problem is if they want something specific they need to post a specimen of what this should look like.
"Michelle, you wrote that “the Chase sapphire reserve card will not cover medical expenses.” I was under the impression that it covers up to $2,500 of medical expenses according to the site below. The amount is not enough for a full-blown emergency, but it is something. I typically get extra insurance elsewhere with $2,500 deductible, assuming that CSR can cover the first $2,500 and the insurance can cover the rest. I noticed that many bloggers who promote credit cards (unscrupulous TPG comes to mind) insist that CSR insurance should be enough to meet FP expectations, but it is debatable. In other words, I would not rely on CSR insurance alone, but it is useful to lower premium on extra insurance you buy elsewhere.https:/…travel""If you’re 100 miles or more from home on a trip, you can be reimbursed up to $2,500 for medical expenses if you or your immediate family member become sick or injured."""
"Alrighty, I haven't read the new posts yet but I'm reporting back my discussion with my doctor. (I have KP as my insurance provider, btw)I explained my situation: travel, departing on 31 July at 5 am, arriving in Papeete on 1 Aug at 9pm. Told her that I need to have a RT PCR test with negative results in hand in order to board, test taken within 72 hrs of my flight to Tahiti (which leaves at 335 pm).She told me that KP is now able to provide in house RT PCR tests, with next day results. So, I would take the test Wednesday at 335 pm....Thursday get results (24 hrs).....Friday get on a plane (48 hrs pass) Saturday check in with my negative results and fly from Hawaii to Tahiti at 335 pm (72 hrs).The doctor will provide me a print out of my test request and I will print results of test from their online portal. I asked about a written letter to have as well, she said the print out SHOULD be fine but to confirm with ""whomever"" for clarification. Worst case scenario I am to update her and let her know in about 2 weeks and she'll prepare to type something confirming my results.She said things are constantly changing covid-guidance wise in the medical field, to remain patient, calm, and flexible, and to enjoy preparing for my upcoming trip. So now I'm going to call Hawaiian Airlines just to see if they can provide anything from a flight boarding stand point. More to follow....."
"Hawaiian Airlines currently has no information on the boarding requirements for flights to Tahiti. Meh, it's still early though.....seeing that July 15 is fast approaching I'm sure they'll have another update for us soon.....maybe they will scrap the 72 hr test requirement!"
Thanks for the update cupcake. I spoke to ATN just now and the lady said it can be an email or a text and it doesn’t have to be letter but I suspect this answer would change depending on who answered the phone.
"Yesh24, thanks for YOUR update as well. I think at this point I'm gonna start working on my outfits to take on my trip :-)"
"Yesh, you are correct. Getting information from ATN reps is a mixed bag.I asked about a template or form to use and was told sorry. I can get the covid test here no problem. Getting a physical letter from my PCP is another story in itself."
Do you think all ATN flights will go ahead with flights regardless of how many are on board? The ATN lady said they would but I’m not so sure. I wonder if they will cancel flights if they aren’t more than 70% full.
I was confused about the 72 hour testing timeline too. Im flying SFO to LAX to PPT (all 1 booking via ATN). Does my test have to be taken 72 hours before I board my 1st flight from SFO ? Or before I board my second flight from LAX?Also I thought the new requirements dont need a doctors certificate anymore? And just a self filled sanitary entry form?
"IvK, I apologize, you are correct. It looks like I accidentally downloaded the benefits guide for the Preferred and not the Reserve. Oy! Thanks for providing the link. Now I can review the proper benefits guide better. Thanks and sorry about the confusion."
"Jyotsnacs,For the 72 hour requirement, the website says that your test must be taken 72 hours ""before the flight to TAHITI."" To me, that means that whatever leg of your trip gets you to the country, THAT'S the window you use for your 72 hours.Yesterday my doctor confirmed my thought (my flight to Tahiti leaves on a Saturday, so I NEED to get tested on Wednesday, with the results provided on Thursday. This meets the 72 hr time requirement), but even she wants me to triple confirm. I tried but my airline didn't have a confirmation to provide (yet). However on ATN's website, they basically say the same thing for their flights. I just looked at some popular resorts for Bora Bora and Moorea. A LOT of rooms are selling out for August, July has some availability still. I have the feeling that with me (and a few adventurous others) showing up to the check in counter on 1 Aug, I'll be somewhat of their ""guinea pig"" to see how these requirements work. I don't mind. I will be pleasant, friendly and compliant. I will have printouts of everything: medical card, itineraries, insurance, CC insurance, rental car information, EVERYTHING in a tabbed binder for them. Seriously. Because I AM getting on that plane and I AM celebrating my 40th in Tahiti. You're going to go to Tahiti as well, and you will enjoy yourself :-)"
"Yesh24,I'm thinking arrogantly when I say they wouldn't DARE cancel flights once they have decided to restart tourism into their obviously hurting job economy. That's bad PR, for one. Word of mouth spreads, and folks who are already on the fence about going would definitely bail if that were to happen. That's what THIS optimist believes, anyways.....and that's all I have to go off of LOL. Also, ATN has confirmed their flights on their website, so it seems legit. Not sure the same could be said for HA, but I have the option of jumping on an ATN flight if all else fails."
"Final comment of the morning. I checked my Allianz insurance and the email I received from them as an update and I can confirm that they gave me some covid-related coverage and covid related medical expenses and etc. This was probably because of when I purchased the insurance (right at the beginning of the pandemic) so maybe they were being generous? Whatever, I'll take it. They probably don't offer this NOW because of how large the issue became, but...*shrugs*"
"Afternoon lovelies, Thanks for the updates everyone. We are getting the ATN flight from Paris to Tahiti and we transit through Canada. I asked the ATN lady and she said the 72 hours needs to be before the Paris flight not the Canada flight. But I think ours is a different situation as we’re only stopping for fuel and not boarding new passengers in Canada."
"Cupcake, it’s interesting what you said about the hotels as the ATN lady (my best pal these days lol) said that my flight from Paris is at 80% capacity already for the end of July."
"Yesh24,That's good news. Well, not to those who are panicked about flying....so this may mean that those remaining late July rooms may be snatched up very soon...which means I may not get a free upgrade lolAnyways I think at this point, we should all just be mindful to be flexible. Information and requirements (as vague as they may currently seem) have been provided and may be updated one more time before July 15. I think we should be over prepared and bring any and everything possible with us, in hand, prior to boarding. In my opinion the gate agent is ultimately the one who will make or break your trip, and that goes for ALL travel. This is probably new for them too and I don't want to add to their stress load, nor mine. So, pleasant-as-cherry-pie will be my mantra while traveling."
"Cupcake,Thanks for all the helpful info! I called ATN and they said 72 hours before my LAX flight too just to be safe. Are you taking the ATN from LAX too? For those flying ATN from LAX - the flight is scheduled to leave daily from LAX at 1155pm. Counting backwards 72 hours, its impossible to take the test at 1155pm at night 3 days before. So Ill have to take it the next morning first thing which makes it like 60 hours before - hope thats sufficient for results! My doc says 24 hours :) so Ill keep my fingers crossed!And yes I love your optimistic attitude - I will be in Tahiti in August ! So will you and you ll have the best time :)."
Following along here! Thanks for posting updates. We rescheduled our 2 week trip from May to mid-September. Bummed about the recent US / EU travel restriction announcement. Fingers crossed! 80 days!
"Hi Brittany!Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but Polynesia isn't governed by the EU. Therefore this announcement wouldn't overrule Polynesia's plan of reopening 15 July.FP is considered an overseas country and territory. I think there was talk about them joining the EU but I'm not sure what the status is on that. I think we're safe to continue planning our trips."
"Jyotsnacs,I think you will be fine test-wise. Wear your mask and take vitamins and limit being around others until it's time for you to board :-)I'm flying on Hawaiian Air from Honolulu to Papeete. My flights are a little weird because I was using points for free travel. So I leave from DC to LAX at 5 am (United). Then I leave LAX to HNL at 6 pm that same day (Hawaiian Air). I spend the night in HNL, then fly to PPT at 335 pm (HA)."
"Cupcake, we are also flying on HA from San Diego with a night on Oahu. Good news now is that Hawaii has lifted the 14 day quarantine with a negative covid test results 72 hours before traveling."
Bonjour
"Scoshi,We are THIS much closer to our dream vacation....I am actually getting excited now :-)"
"Hi everyone, ATN has provided more details and information regarding the Covid test process prior to check-in/boarding the flights for those passenger from Paris-PPT. They did not specify this information (yet) on their US website. So far it is only on the French website which apply to Paris-PPT flights. But since those flights start July 3rd and the LAX-PPT flights only start July 15th that could be why the US website is not yet updated. Below is a google translation: Step 1 - get tested (they have provided a recommended lab in France called SYNLAB) - this is a similar partnership they already made with a local lab Reliant Urgent care in California.Step 2 - THIS IS NEW! Communicate your results following receipt of the result of your RT-PCR test by the laboratory:Upon receipt of the test result sent by the laboratory, go to the Air Tahiti Nui website and download your electronic copy of the test result on the form-Covid page. This action on your part will transmit your test result to the airline, before the departure of the flight, and thus simplify your registration. You will need to download the test results for all passengers in the same flight record (same file number).If the result is negative, Air Tahiti Nui will then confirm receipt of your test result and authorization to travel to Polynesia, in which case it will not be necessary to present the test result at check-in, but you you must have a copy with you during your trip in order to present it in the event of an inspection.Please respect the barrier gestures between the day of your test and the day of departure to avoid being contaminated.If the result is positive and as we already know ATN will rebook you on another flight at a later time and free of charge.Edited: 10:44 am, July 02, 2020 "
"Thanks for the update, Tim. I'm wondering if HA will have a similar process in place (Step #2)...."
I am waiting covid test guidance from United Airlines. They confirmed they are resuming Tahiti flights from SFO.
I was under the assumption that you could still go to your own clinic if you wanted to. Is this correct or do you need to use one of the testing clinics they list?
"My understanding is that you can go to any clinic, the ones provided by ATN are just suggestions because the airlines have been in discussion with them and they can guarantee to test you and have results within the 72 hours window but yes I think you can go to any clinic of your choice."
Thanks Tim. I would use the ones they suggest but I’m flying from London to Paris first so unless it is results within a few hours then it won’t be possible.
"I see, anyway here is the link (French): https://www.airtahitinui.com/fr-fr/air-tahit…What's interesting is that they just say the test must be done 3 days prior to the flight so really they won't be counting the hours. ie if you get tested Day 1 morning for a flight that leaves Day 4 afternoon or evening it is acceptable even if it's slightly above 72 hours as long as it doesn't exceed 3 days. The table in the link shows that for someone flying on Tuesday at noon they should get tested Saturday morning."
"I’m very interested to learn how United will handle this at the gate at SFO. I think it’s very unlikely they will go to the lengths that ATN has to organize health clinics and the like, and a great many travelers to FP will be only connecting through SFO, having to get a test elsewhere. In an earlier version of the entry guidelines they allowed for a coronavirus genome test (e.g. RT-PCR) but now they seem to be specifying specifically RT-PCR. This makes a big difference because the rapid Abbot test is a genomic test but uses NAAT (nucleic acid amplification) rather than RT-PCR. It is very hard to find rapid RT-PCR tests in the US and even in states doing a lot of testing (e.g. New York), the guidelines for when you can expect your results are 3–5 days at most places, even if they are returning the vast majority within 48 hours."
"Well.Hawaiian Air cancelled my flight (LAX-HNL-PPT). However they gave me a full refund. So I booked it over to ATN's website and purchased my nonstop flight from LAX to PPT. However this flight leaves on 1 Aug, so I had to do a modification to my AA flight. I said to hell with it and will be in LA on 29 July. I'll take my COVID test at the clinic ATN recommended, sit for 2 days in a hotel and then take my negative results to the airport with me. I guess in the end, the whole testing/flight change thing worked out for me? I had to extend my time in Moorea, but really, I'm not complaining...28 days to go!"
"We're on the same boat cupcake but the wait in LA will be worth it!!Btw ATN changed my flight back to LA today, by a few hours only, looks like they are finalizing August schedule now!"
"Tim, I am on pins and needles LOL They changed my flight time, I now leave 2 hours earlier...I think I've gained 15 new gray hairs within 24 hrs! Semper Gumby!"
Tahiti Tourism just uploaded this video on their website to show how travel would be once FP opens next week :https://youtu.be/eG57-7e8L80
Jyotsnacs - Thank you for posting. This will help us decide what excursions we will or won't pick.Did you figure out your Covid test?
Sue - Yes I spoke with my doctor and she is able to refer me to a test with a turnaround of 24-48 hours. I will either do that or the Stanford test. We leave on August 6th too so pretty close to when you leave too! Are you flying United from SFO or ATN from LAX ?
"Thanks for this! In re to the amendment about Travel Insurance..... Is that saying that it is not required now by adding the line that says ""or will be paid by the traveller""?"
"Rick - See below: ""Have travel insurance or personally assume all expenses related to cost of care including hospitalization, confinement, or repatriation, should the visitor fall ill during their stay;""Source:https://tahititourisme.ca/en-ca/covid-19/"
