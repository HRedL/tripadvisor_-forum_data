Does anyone know the re-opening details are for Aruba?
"Hello! This was posted on https:/…VID-19) and Travel to ArubaAs Aruba prepares to open up borders again, VisitAruba is running a Health & Safety Travel Survey. Your feedback would be very much appreciated. It will only take 5 minutes of your time! Click here to take the survey.Latest UpdatesJune 5, 2020 – Zero active cases – Aruba is busy preparing for reopening. The number of active positive COVID-19 coronavirus cases remains at zero with total persons recovered at 98. Aruba’s total cases to date remains at 101. The number of quarantined persons remains at 159. There have been 3 deaths confirmed related to COVID-19. 18 persons have been tested since yesterday – total persons tested to date is now 2168. There are no inconclusive test results at this time.The Aruba government has not yet announced a date for reopening of Aruba’s borders for international travel. In the meantime, the airport, accommodations and most sections of Aruba’s tourism industry are busy preparing for this date. With the local spread appearing to be under control (zero active cases since May 28), the Aruba Government along with various tourism organizations and the Department of Health are all working closely together to define, clarify and implement the protocols and procedures deemed necessary to balance the pressing economic needs of Aruba and visitor safety as well as safety of the local population.During a televised forum yesterday evening where representatives of the aforementioned organizations were present, several of the protocols and preparations were discussed. These included airport screening with temperature checks, short interviews by doctors, and flow control at the airport. It was indicated that any suspected cases at the airport will be subject to a test with a result available within 45 minutes. There was also mention of an obligatory insurance that all visitors would be required to have to cover certain costs related to COVID-19 protocols and procedures in case of a visitor testing positive, including a hospital stay or ICU placement if required. The intention is to combine the insurance requirement with the mandatory ED card application procedure. Protocols for isolation and transportation of positive cases are also being finalized. In terms of facility updates at the airport, plexiglass shields would be in place at all counters, sanitation protocols in all airport areas have been revised, PPE equipment will be mandatory for all airport staff, air quality at the airport will be enhanced, and airline protocols will be updated. Information was also provided about preparations at accommodations, including glass/plexiglass shields on check-in, contactless room entry, rigorous sanitation regimens etc. More information and details on these protocols and procedures are anticipated soon from the respective authorities."
"Thank you for this information!Are there any lists of countries that are allowed and not allowed to come? Like they do it in Europe with the slow opening for certain countries? The reason I'm asking, we are holding a resort reservation, starting on June, 19, but our AA flight (via Miami) was cancelled and at the moment we are unable to find any flight from US for our dates. Is this an indication that Americans will not be allowed to come?Thank you,NV"
Thanks flyers. I did stumble on that survey yesterday and took it.
The airport is still closed. No word on whether it will be open then but pretty doubtful. We are scheduled to arrive July 7 and Delta has “no seats available” on any flights then. I am skeptical that every flight is full. They say they will add flights if the airport announces opening. American and United have flights but will not refund if u cancel. Only give credit.
"The insurance requirement for visitors is interesting. I don’t know of any travel insurance that would cover any costs associated with COVID. Just because I don’t know of any such coverage doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist, but I’m skeptical that it does."
can't find one either
I am waiting to book any airfare until I know what the details of the opening will be. I do have international coverage on my health insurance which I have had to use previously. I will have to check out if it covers covid when traveling.
"Sadly this is the message i just received from a close friend who lives on the island. I am not sure its accurate its just what he just sent me.""now i heard aruba will not open the borders until November"" there was more but you get the point. He was sad and is worried about all the other job losses coming if this is in fact accurate."
I don't think that is accurate Jay. I could be wrong but that is a huge leap going from a tentative opening of June 15th - July 1st.
"I wouldn’t believe anything until their government actually comes out with something official. They had a televised conference discussing all the changes they’ve made at the airports and plans for when the borders open, hard to believe they would discuss all that if they weren’t planning to open at all for 6 months. I’m also not sure how their economy would survive?"
"Jay, your friend may have heard news abound restricting travel from a particular country, or region. Some countries are still dealing with rising cases. So an extended ban would be understandable, and would probably not have a huge impact on their economy. But otherwise, I would tend not to believe the rumor."
Again guys I only have what one of my friends sent to me today. Its not a normal question for me to ask my other friends...I sent my best friend a simple how are you an hour ago....he will let me know if its accurate without me even asking. I don't ever try to break news to my island friends. I hope my friend is wrong....I just don't think he is.
I just spoke with the friend who gave me the news and he said he received the info from 2 different friends but this again has not been confirmed. I hope its a false rumor that has started and hope we get new info that proves it incorrect.
It is probably best to just wait until an official announcement has been made. Between the virus and the protests who knows.
I spoke with my best friend on the island a little while ago. He said while he did hear that rumor he thinks its just that a rumor. He said the Ritz is scheduled to open up on July 1st. They have been completing training on what the new normal will be. He said the new normal includes washable masks for the employees. He is worried how hot some of them will get outside but its required as expected.I am hoping everything goes well and they do open up for business on July 1 as planned.
"I successfully bought JB tickets leaving NYC from JFK July 9th-12th, selected my seats, etc. I'm crossing my fingers this will be open...."
"It looks like the plane that arrived from Amsterdam is having everyone self quarantine for two weeks. I guess we'll see if they have the rest of the planes doing this as wekl. If the do, I guess the August trip is out."
"Flyers I am honestly not sure what flight you are referring to. The island is currently closed for incoming travel and is not scheduled to open till 6/15 at the very earliest.Edited: 11:01 pm, June 07, 2020 "
"Hi,This is direct from the VisitAruba website:June 7, 2020 – Zero active cases maintained – KLM repatriation flight brings residents back to Aruba. The number of active positive COVID-19 coronavirus cases remains at zero with total persons recovered at 98. Aruba’s total cases to date remains at 101. The number of quarantined persons has dropped by 5 to 69. This number is expected to rise again following a repatriation flight from Amsterdam on June 6 that carried an as yet undisclosed number of Aruba residents, all of whom must follow the mandatory 14-day quarantine protocol. 5 persons have been tested since yesterday – total persons tested to date is now 2179. There have been 3 deaths confirmed in Aruba related to COVID-19. There are no inconclusive test results at this time."
Thanks DML. I just assumed many of us were already following that page closely! Have a good day everyone!
We are booked for first week of August but will cancel if there is a quarantine. I can't imagine anyone wanting to go and be told to quarantine. I do believe this is a consideration as it was a question on the visitor survey. Makes me concerned that they are strongly considering this as an option.
"Yeah, I hear you there. I guess the only folks this would not be as important to are those that spend a month down there. I have neve been to Aruba, but it seems that there are a good amount of people who spend a good bit of their summer down there (or get away for the winter)."
"They’ve been having all returning residents quarantine for two weeks, it isn’t new. They’re also still in “phase 3”’of their reopening. I would hope they wouldn’t make tourists quarantine for two weeks as well but I guess we’ll see."
Please worry about something that might actually happen....Aruba reopening and then having visitors quarantine for 14 days will never happen. If Aruba feels like that is what they need to do in order to keep their country safe they won't open the boarders at all.
100% Jay!
"Saw this post on the Aruba tourism forum. NOT official, but I have read similar comments elsewhere. Has anyone else learned anything new? “The Government plans to introduce COVID-19 insurance in case you test positive for the virus in Aruba. This insurance could be mandatory and will be offered by insurance companies in Aruba. COVID-19 insurance will cover transportation, accommodation, and medical care when you test positive for coronavirus. According to Tourism Minister, COVID-19 insurance is not official yet, pending final agreements with local insurance companies (further details and information will be announced by The Government).”"
That's great Jay!
"You never know Jay. I think the UK is asking visitors to self-quarantine for 14 days. Again, I have never been here and I just read in the other forum that Aruba tourism accounts for almost 90% of the economy. I figured it was high, but that is enough to want to get people back. Again, I comment on these just as a discussion board. I guess we won't know anything for sure until they come out with something formal! I'm excited to add this as country number 27 on my journey around the world!"
Flyers what does the UK have to do with Aruba??
"When I mentioned about a 14-day quarantine, someone said that wouldn't happen. I was just referring to another country that has imposed that knowing it could happen. =/ That was all!I think I'm also worried now that my third destination for this summer is going to be cancelled. First it was the Galapagos with 32 students that I was going to take as well as a trip to London/Edinburgh.Edited: 7:49 pm, June 08, 2020 "
"I am on my plan D. We were originally supposed to go to Treasure Cay, Bahamas. That was hit by a hurricane. Then we made plans to visit Provo, that was cancelled twice due to covid. We have tentative plans now for Florida or Aruba. I have been to Aruba 6 times previously. My first time was in the month of August. The weather was great and the water was warm. Eagle beach is my favorite beach. I am booked at Bucuti but I haven't booked any air yet. It is outside the hurricane belt so it is a good choice."
I have a flight booked with United for Sept 3rd and timeshare in Marriott. Fingers crossed we can ge there without covid insurance or quarantine.
"Still to early to know about the Covid insurance but it appears to be likely from recent reports but I would NOT worry about quarantine upon arrival unless you some how had your temp spike upon arrival, then get a test and test positive. Other than that Aruba wont open the their boarders for visitors to quarantine for 2 weeks."
"jayd,The only way we can become quarantined ""boarders"" is if Aruba opens its ""borders."""
lol....you get my message. Wont happen. Whether we are boarders or open the borders....Aruba will NEVER open and require guests to quarantine for 2 weeks when the average vacation is half that. Here is hoping travel gets back to normal and we can go back to answering who is the weather in Aruba.
We just changed our travel plans from end of June to November 5. Hope everything is open by then!
"I think a distinction needs to be made between (returning) residents being quarantined for 2 weeks and tourists. Residents have to be quarantined automatically since they can have the virus but be asymptomatic. Since they’ll be on the island a lot longer than 2 weeks, the quarantine is important. Tourists will be tested at the airport upon arrival. First by infrared thermometer, then if their temp is over 100.4 (I think) they get a virus test. If that test is positive, they get quarantined in a special hotel, specifically designated for them or get sent to a hospital. Hence the insurance requirement. If either test at the airport is negative, no quarantine is done. That’s still a risk, but so is killing your country’s economy. Oh, one more point. Just a hunch, of course, but once the COVID insurance requirement is made law, and you have to purchase it from an Aruba company, don’t expect it to be removed any time before 2021. It’s both insurance for the country against rising medical expenses, and an additional source of revenue. Odds are it’ll be around a while."
Have to wait and see how much the insurance will cost. I like to travel to Aruba a few times a year for long weekends.. Depending on the cost of this insurance .. might have to change my plans around.
"I fold. The info just came out. $15 a day per person. Plus, a lot of other hoops to jump through."
What are the other hoops?
https:/…
Wonder how many people will decide its not worth it to go ..
"Wow I am just getting caught up. Those ""guidelines"" are more than cumbersome IMO. I have reservations for April and I hope its safe to relax some of the standards or I won't go away.....it won't be worth it IMO."
"Yeah, that´s was just talking about with the family. I always tell them not to get married to one place or you end up getting disappointed! It looks like we hold off for Cancun in November and maybe head to Florida this August. If I don´t get here this year, there will be another time! With a family of 4, this is too much of a risk with everything in place."
Understandable for sure.
Thanks Flyers for providing the hyperlink. It is nice to finally have the details.
