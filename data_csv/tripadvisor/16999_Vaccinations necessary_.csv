The CDC site recommends hepa and other shots. My insurance does not cover this. Do I really need them? We will be in Manila and Boracay only and won't spend time in rural areas.

"Do you need them ..No. The question is do you want to take the risk?I enure my Hep A & B, and Typhoid are up to date. I ensure my immunity to cholera is also current. This requires taking an oral vacinne every 2 years.Make sure you wear adequate protection against mosquitos as there is dengue Fever in certain parts of the Manila against which you can not take any preventative medication.Malaria isnt an issue where you are travelling.Tommo"
I would throw a rabies vaccination into the mix. Lots of stray dogs on the streets and rabies has always been an issue.
For me rabies is like a snake bite... I would not get a shot unless I'm bitten.
"I agree with Tommo.You do not need them.Just as you do not need them to go to any of the larger towns in South east asia. It is not like Philippines is crawling with all kinds of diseases. Definitely not the places you have mentioned. Having said that, CDC (and foreigner = western tourists in general) like to be on the safer side. (which naturally is amusing to locals - but that talk can go on endlessly). So my suggestion is - If you do not take these shots, you will not fall sick / dieIf you take these shots, you will not fall sick / die.If you feel you should take the shots, do take them - the very fact that you had this doubt is reason enough for you to take the shots - at least you will FEEL safer."
"YLOO, what does CDC mean? I don't think I have heard that before. Thanks."
"Q,...It means Center for Disease Control."
"Thank you, Sole."
It always figures prominently in movies about epidemics and such. Or Walking Dead. Haha. Thank you Hollywood!
"@ Q CuppsterCDC is the centers for disease control and prevention. based in USA. a think tank whose research and information on diseases is excellent most of the time, but they do tend to be over cautious, especially regarding tropical countries - and their stance and point of view is very United States (yes - not always good - especially keeping in mind the kind of food they themselves eat)website here - http://www.cdc.gov/"
"Get them and I say this is because if your insurance would have paid, you would have gotten them, correct? So get them, that way you can travel anywhere you want and think OH MY GOSH, I DID NOT HAVE MY SHOTS."
"Thank you, YLOO. That's why I like this forum. Always something to learn. I agree those recommendations are from a Western point of view. That part of the world tends to be overinsured and sometimes paranoid."
its not paranoid to make professionally sound medical recommendations.Would you get those shots etc for your child? I would for sure.
"No. That is not paranoid. You are correct, leftover."
"@ Q Cupster - ou are welcome :)@ LeftovertooNo, they are not paranoid. (But then, what is paranoia to one may be cautiousness to the other and foolishness to a third. it is all a matter of perspective)It is just that westerners and Asians have different ways of seeing these things. Westerners are generally prone to using more medicines, and being more careful about things that they do not find at home (illnesses, diseases, chaotic traffic) while Asians have a different perspective.For example, when a westerner gets a cold, he / she usually would go to the doctor and get medicines > Though if you ask any doctor, he will tell you that there is no cure for cold - as the quip goes, it takes 7 days to go with medicines and a week to go without medicines. medicines give a feeling of relief from the symptoms of cold An Asian will usually groan and allow his body to drive the cold away. Many Filipinos will have a brew of ginger in hot water (incidentally as scientific as medicines, except that it has have zero side effects, is cheaper, is natural and does not fill the coffers of an MNC)I used to be the former, I am now slowly gravitating to the latter.Plus I am well aware that the general immunity of westerners is different (I wanted to say lower, which would have been more truthful, but am sure would have irked lots of people, so I will use the more politically correct word - ""different"") - not because of any personal deficiency, but simply because of the environment they live in.Hence my suggestion - If you have a doubt whether you should get shots, Yes, you should.Of course, there are different types of western tourists too.... so one cannot generalise. (one good example are Aussies - those from cities, but especially those from non-city environments, who are used to living in more adverse climate)Edited: 7 years ago "
