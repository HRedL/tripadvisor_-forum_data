"I'm hearing horror stories of epidemic-like proportions -- Norwalk virus, people being hospitalized, etc. Can anyone shed some OBJECTIVE light on this? We're going to be at the Blau Natura Park in early March. Thanks for your input."
"Read the hotel reviews, posted here. I believe that's as objective as they come. The last two for Dreams Palm Beach mention nearly everyone in both parties getting very sick. We were at DPB and got home last Thursday after cutting our vacation short due to the violence of the strain we encountered.On Tuesday, DPB posted something on its FaceBook page saying there had been no new reports of illness in three days. Since then, the two reviews here contradict that. I think it will take time to see if the problem has been resolved, or if the notice is to keep people from canceling reservations.Some people go and get sick but it doesn't ruin their vacation. I've been saying get the facts before you go, and anyone with children or a medical issue should stay away until reviews here verify that the hotel has dealt with the problem successfully."
