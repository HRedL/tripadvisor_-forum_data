I realise you cannot predict snowfall but when roughly does the ski season come to a halt at Glenshee ?
They usually push hard to remain open until Easter - so that's mid-April this year. There has been a lot of snow in the last month but it's lying on a fairly warm base and I don't know how long things will last.Not all their lifts are open today. I reckon that's probably due to cross-winds rather than lack of snow.
"Thank you so much for your reply , we were booked for Les Houches on March 25th but obviously that’s not happening now so are looking at coming up to Scotland"
I think of Glenshee as great for a day trip - in my case from Edinburgh - because there isn't that much accommodation near the lifts. Or have you got somewhere in mind?
"We are just going to do 2 nights so looking for somewhere Pitlochry way , I know it’s a 45 min drive but we don’t mind .i just have everything crossed that the snow will stay , is it fairly decent skiing at Glenshee ?"
"There are a couple of challenging runs such as the steep Cairnwell, or you can head over into the next valley to Glas Maol, where there's some magnificent skiing in Coire Fionn or the West Wall - if you get there early you can sometimes carve turns in pristine snow. It's quite a large area, enough to keep you happy for a couple of days.Les Houches is mostly black and red - I'm thinking of the Kandahar - whereas Glenshee is more an intermediate skier's area overall. If you want more challenging skiing, the best place is probably Glencoe. Compact and gnarly. (IMO obviously)It's easier to get up Glenshee if you stay somewhere like Blairgowrie - the A93 heads straight north from there via Bridge of Cally. There's a ski hire on the way out of Blairgowrie, and a couple of others e.g. Spittal of Glenshee, or at the ski car park.In the very unlikely event of overnight snow, it's more likely they'd keep the Perth - Blairgowrie - Glenshee road clear because that's how most skiers get there. The A924 (Pitlochry to Bridge of Cally) is much less used and therefore lower priority. Likewise the Dunkeld Blairgowrie road."
Sorry to ask this question but is it wise to travel with the virus expecting to escalate in the next two weeks.The reason most of Europe is locked down is because the virus can travel easily and either you could take it to Glenshee or take it home with you.
"Since January I have travelled to Gran Canaria , Austria , Germany , Switzerland and Tenerife with no ill effects , I have no intention of getting close to or intimate with anyone on the ski slope ..... I am a post lady by day and feel I am more at risk from my job that I am forced to attend than skiing on my own with my partner hundreds of metres away from anyone else"
"RudyardKThank you so very much for all your extremely helpful advice , I have my fingers crossed that the slopes will stay open and we can have a few days away fro the madness that the world has descended into"
"If as a post lady you obviously meet a lot of people, as you say, this puts yoou in potentially higher risk of infection than some, is it not then better that you don't travel unless you have to, just for a couple of weeks , the mountains will be here next year?"
"So a total ban on non essential travel, at least now we have a clear guideline"
"juneit is not a ban, they are asking asking us to voluntarily refrain from travel.Some will ignore it as ""it will not happen to them"". Hope they think about anyone they meet who later develops the virus"
What ban?
"Both Westminster and Holyrood are coming out with weasel words: they're not banning public venues but they really really don't want you to go to concerts pubs restaurants. Or ski slopes for that matter.If the French closed all ski resorts with immediate effect on Saturday, that's for good reason, no matter the chaos it caused."
I’m back from Venice last week and one of the issues the locals were talking about was the spread of CV through the Dolomite ski slopes. As soon as schools etc closed many people headed off skiing then travelled home taking the virus with them.
"A footnote:https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highl…Most ski resorts in Scotland remain open. Ski companies live a hand-to-mouth existence in Scotland. This year's skiing started abysmally (no snow) and the companies were much cheered when snow arrived a month ago. And now covid. They will want to stay open until the time when they're forced to close.Whether you *ought* to go is another matter. I think it's in *all* our interests to discourange movement, and hunker down."
"Footnote 2Glenshee (and all the other ski resorts) are closing due to the covid epidemic.In other news, highland and island people are getting p'd off with people turning up in campervans or taking airbnbs, hoping to ride out the epidemic somewhere safe. By travelling they are putting small communities at risk, communities without the medical infrastructure you'd expect in a major city. Apparently Cornwall, Wales, Yorkshire all report similar problems. It's about time the government declared a complete lockdown with swingeing penalties for people who break it."
"Glenshee is shutting on Sunday. 'Although the government has not yet closed down outdoor activities, we have taken the decision to close tomorrow (Sunday) at the end of the day in line with other Scottish Ski Areas.A big thank you to all our customers for supporting us throughout the Season. We hope to see you back at Glenshee next Season.'"
