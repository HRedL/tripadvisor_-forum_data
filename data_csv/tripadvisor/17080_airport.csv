"Pam would you please give me some details, I would appreciate it."
"Ditto - what miserable experience-we can't reply properly to your post without details - and my assumption is that you posted to get replies-otherwise what is the point. Regards, Leigh"
"pam, for someone from maimi to complain about punta cana airport, is really the pot calling the kettle black. I avoid Maimi airport at all costs, in my opinion it's the worst airport in the U.S. Slowest customs, 1/2 of employes don't speak english (we're in the U.S.) by the time you clear customs you get to search for your luggage that has been piling up for 1-2 hours. Punta Cana is a breeze compared to Maimi."
"good. one less person hogging a sunbed or two!seriously though, how can we answer this without knowing details. I sense the pot was just stirred to get us punta cana devotees jumping on this. Mission accomplished I guess lol"
"Why is it the negative people are always new, post once, and leave..... it is becoming an epidemic.Be happy"
"She should have written at least a few lines as to what happened, but, possibly, if it was one of thpse issues of security people taking money out of a wallet she could simply be too upset depending on how much was taken. Yes, it can occur all over but when something happens to you, you aren't always rational.I agree though, I want to know WHAT HAPPENED?!!!! And a lone remark makes me nuts!"
"even if you had an issue at the airport..ON YOUR WAY OUT of the country..would you say you would never return to the country again? I mean, The Dominican Republic DOES have more than one airport.I have a hard time with these types of posts. They are like a hit and run..New poster..only one post and it is negative. A first post being negative is not the real bug in my butt...it is that they don't stay on site long enough to answer questions..thus the hit and run comment.oh wellI should just relax, after all in one and a half hours my big bro and carmen will be being picked up at edenh by Mike Fisher and taken to the PC airport to fly to Canada for a two week holiday.Poor Carmen. As a dominican travelling to Canada for the first time..wonder what she will think of Pearson Airport eeekkk."
"I somewhat agree with Pam...I will never travel to the US again because of multiple bad experiences I have had there! I realize I have lived here my whole life and will continue to, but man have I had some bad times here in the States!Cheers"
"Perhaps pam was with caninegirl who wrote of her experience:""We arrived at the airport in DR (which really resembled Gilligan's Island....the airport was composed of huts) we were exited on the runway and then charged $15.00 a person before being allowed into the baggage area (crazy) luggage took forever"" Perhaps when pam visits TA she can enlighten us further"
Do they really charge $15? I've know of the departure tax but now a arrival tax?? Am I missing something?
there is an entry tax of $10 per per. bg
Thanks. I did not know that. We were there 3 years ago and it wasn't in place then. 
Hi Many Non-UK tour operators include the $10 for the tourist fee in their price
Thanks Flipflop- I'll have to check that out. Since my TA didn't mention anything-I;m presuming it's included.Pam- Are you going to give us anything?
"Sasksun, the entry tax has been in place for many years, at least since I started traveling to the DR in 2004. For that flight (ACV) we were given the cards with our tickets. Since then, depending on who I flew with or whether I booked air only or a package, or whether I was checking in with e-tickets, it may or may not have been included but when it was, the entry card was distributed on the plane. In those days, Canada's operators tended to include the entry card in your purchase price but you had to pay the $20 departure. In the US it was ""usually"" reversed. It seems like the Canadian operators are now started to include both. Make sure you find out what is and isn't included in your package. When I flew with Conquest in May, 2007, it was supposed to be included but wasn't. I had to buy the card in the terminal and then I got my money back for that purchase from the travel agent once I returned to Canada.Kaki"
"Thanks Kaki. We flew with Skyservice 3 years ago and know I didn't have to pay at the airport. This year, we are travelling with ACV for the first time so I'll have to check it out."
Huh?
"...the former was meant in reply to the question, not the replies. "
Well at least someone got some good information from such a stupid post.
"hey,i hope her problem wasn't that they didn't wanna let her leave.hopefully she's back the that beautiful 100% typical styled Miami airport, which by the way isn't free for european visitors there to enter or leave. the security taxes are just mostly included in the tickets, so nobody spend bigger attention to that.is Miami airport still that full of cigarette butts all over around the doors where you leave the airport downstairs to the area where the shuttles arrive/depart?i saw a lot of airports, including a big number in the US, but Miami always been the 'less cleaned up/maintained/service providing"" one of all.so what finally been the problem at the airport, where's the complain?Mike"
"We don't know Mike - she has not posted again - so what was the point-regards, Leigh"
"LOL. I read the post and thought, am I missing something here. What is the problem. As far as I know almost everyone has complaints about every airport. Everyone has either had or known someone who has had one of those oh so wonderful airport experiences. If theft was an issue,guess what,it can happen in any country. Watch what the customs officials are doing while they search your stuff. Can't you remove your money from your wallet.It's sad that you have to be so worried about these things, what a world we live in now."
"""Drive by""......Or as Lynn said....""Hit and Run""....But it was defintely NOT....""Shock and awe""....:-)"
