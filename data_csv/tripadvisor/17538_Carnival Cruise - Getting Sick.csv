"Hi,I've been looking in a few different areas for help with this and thought this may be the place to post. My parents went on a Carnival Cruise in May and didn't have a very good time. Ever since they have returned, my mom has been getting weird chest pains/attacks- we've looked into everything, but have come up with nothing. She didn't have them before she went on the cruise - the boat was late, and they were shoved into a huge room with the air conditioner blasting for 8 hours. I've heard of people getting sick from cruises before, but I'm not sure if anyone has experienced the same thing. This site has been so helpful to me in the past, and I'm hoping someone can shed some light on this...thanks for any help you can offer - even if it's to direct me to a more appropriate place to post this request.M."
"Tons of people have gotten sick on Carnival...it's a piece of crap cruise line.....check with the Center of Disease Control in Atlanta, or the Hillsborough County Health Department"
"I went on this cruise line twice and had no problems. Once I took a troop of 20 girl scouts to the Bahamas for 3 days, and the other time my husband and I and our 2 boys went on a 7 day cruise to the western Carribean and had a wonderful time. No illnesses or sickness at all. "
" I caught Norfolk virus on Celebrity Cruise Lines. Sick 6 Days,both me and wife.Went to ship Doctor who had my room scrubbed ,floor to ceiling and asked for stool samples. After trip both me and travel agent asked for some kind of compensation.Even a nice letter saying they were sorry would have been nice.  They called me a liar did nothing. They just dont give a sh.. wonce they have your money.  pete "
"Hi,Many cruise ships have been delayed due to the need for super cleaning. One of the probs is a bacteria called ""legionellus"". AKA legionaires (sp) disease. It can cause illnesses in folks who have compromised immune systems. ie;this is environmental & can live in a/c systems,vents,etc.I hear about this every now & them. Have her MD do some blood work. Good Luck!"
"Been on lots of Carnival cruises and had no problems. Saw them cleaning regularly. Generally bring the can of lysol and spray down the room when we get there just to be safe and always wash hands frequently, when we get back to the room after being out on the ship, and always before eating. Closed environments with lots of people always have more of a chance of illness. Did they check for fungal infections? Most docs don't even consider it, but they can be a cause of problems (don't know your specifics, though). That could have been picked up at a foreign port as well."
"Just saw this tonight and hope your mother is better by now. However, if she's still having problems please make sure her doc knows what islands she visited. Tap water is a lot of the cruising grounds can be the source of some strange illnesses. As for cruising, it is similar to flying with someone with the flu! I've been on dozens of cruises, some on Carnival, and have never gotten sick BUT use my hand sanitizer, drink only bottled water and take Airborne beginning before we travel. I know, lots of precautions, but it's worked so far!"
"Just came back from a cruise on the Carnival Inspiration and WE have all been sick since. 7 out of the 8 of us who went, have been extremely ill. It starts out like a cold and within a day or so we had temps and respiratory infections. This is the first cruise that has made my family or I sick. We are past cruisers and tend to be faitly healthy people. We stayed on 3 different floors and in between 4 different cabins. I honestly feel that we picked up this bactreial infection up on the cruise ship and not in port. I have been advised that the air on these ships is recycled and perhaps these bacteria can live in the air systems...HMMMMMMM! perhaps someone else has heard this?"
The cruise industry must be just about broke.With all these epidemics on board who would book a cruise?I guess hardly anyone would dare to go on a cruise anymore. Are the ships going out pretty much empty?
"We just came back from a cruise on the Carnival Elation. We cruised from San Diego to Mexico over 5 days. On day 4, we both started to feel unwell. We both started with general malaise, sore throat, and chest burning. We did not have a thermometer but are sure we had a fever. We got home yesterday and are in rough shape. Our chests are completely congested and we alternate between fevers and sweats. I caution anyone interested to go on a cruise to use another cruise line. We previously went on Royal Carribean and had no issues."
"I've never had a problem on a Carnival Cruise or really any cruise line, but it may not be the cruise line. What ports did she visit? She may have contracted something at one of the ports of call. People are more prone to get sick when they're traveling in general because they do too much and they're tired and run down. Plus, you pack so many people into one place like a cruise boat or an airplane germs will spread. I'm sorry your mom is sick. Hopefully, she's feeling better by now. :O) "
Oh I hate this! I just realized I posted to a topic that someone pulled up from 2005! Really people???
