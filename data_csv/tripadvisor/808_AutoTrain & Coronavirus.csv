Has anyone traveled on the AutoTrain recently? I'd like to take it but worry about COVID-19 as the train is an indoor trip.
There is some good info on the Amtrak forum over at Railroad.net about the AutoTrain and adjustments they have made due to Covid. There is also a train travel forum here you might find info inhttps:/â€¦ShowForum-g1-i12483-Train_Travel.html
Thanks a lot !
"Our neighbors took it North last month, and they're snowbirds who waited a long time until they felt comfortable taking it back North to avoid hurricane season."
"Thanks. I'm thinking it's a bad idea, given that the pandemic is getting worse in FL."
