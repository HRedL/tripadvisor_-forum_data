Does not open.How current is it because many restaurant owners are still not clear what the regulations are.
"The link worked for me. I've copied it below.GUIDANCE ISSUED TO THE CONDITIONS OF REOPENING OF FOOD AND BEVERAGE ESTABLISHMENTSWhen restaurants and cafes reopen this month, they should favour the use of terraces and the ‘take away’ service and should encourage prior scheduling, according to guidance from the Directorate-General for Health (DGS) released today.In the guidance, the DGS establishes the various measures that food and beverage establishments must adopt when they reopen on May 18.Among the measures to be adopted, the health authority highlights the reduction of the maximum capacity of the establishment, in order to ensure the recommended physical distance of two meters between people, privileging the use of outdoor areas, such as terraces (whenever possible) and the take-away service.According to DGS, “the arrangement of tables and chairs must guarantee a distance of at least two meters between people, but cohabitants can sit facing each other or side by side, at a lower distance”.Companies must prevent customers from changing the orientation of tables and chairs, allowing employees to do so, but always ensuring the necessary distance.DGS also recommends that, whenever possible and applicable, prior booking for seats be promoted and encouraged.On the other hand, standing spaces are not recommended, as are ‘self-service’ operations such as ‘buffets’.The cleaning and disinfection of spaces must respect the guidelines previously issued by DGS, and owners must disinfect, at least six times a day, all areas of frequent contact (door handles, washbasin taps, tables, benches, chairs, handrails).The same must be done with “critical equipment (such as automatic payment terminals and individual menus”) after each use.The guidance also establishes the need for hand hygiene with alcohol-based solution or soap and water at the entrance and exit of the establishment by customers, who must respect the distance between people of at least two meters and comply with the respiratory label measures.Customers should also consider wearing a mask, except during the meal period, avoid touching unnecessary surfaces and objects and give preference to electronic payment.The document also establishes the procedures to be adopted by the employees of the catering and beverage establishments, namely the use of a mask during the period of work with multiple people.DGS recalls that “the catering and beverage establishments, due to their characteristics, can be places of transmission of infection by SARS-CoV-2, either by direct and / or indirect contact”.For this reason, he argues, additional measures “must be taken to ensure that the transmission of the disease is minimized in these contexts”."
"Link works fine for me also, thank you ptnov."
Thanks PTnov.Local restaurant owners in Carvoeiro have posted elsewhere that they are waiting for final details.As posted earlier some bar owners are looking to use these regulations so that they can open.Maybe having an electric toast maker counts as being a restaurant.I would not put anything past them..
The Portugal Resident posted earlier this afternoon A much more detailed interpretation of the rules..I
"The title of Portugal Resident could't be wronger... ""Cafés and restaurants’ return: clients to wear masks “except when eating”"" and the rest of the text simply better not to comment...Here you have the full text in portuguese for those that want to check by themselves https://www.dgs.pt/directrizes-da-dgs/orient… Anyway for costumers (clientes) what's there is ""all customers must ensure the following measures:Hand wash with alcohol-based solution or with soap and water at the entrance and exit of the establishment (before the meal, hand washing with soap and water should be privileged);Respect the distance between people of at least 2 meters (except cohabitants);Comply with respiratory etiquette measures;Consider the use of a mask for take-away services that are installed inside establishments, always using it appropriately in accordance with the recommendations of the DGS;Avoid touching unnecessary surfaces and objects;Give preference to payment by means that do not involve physical contact between the employee and the customer (for example, contactless automatic payment terminal)""So no mention to masks while seated there..."
"I just saw a response from a restaurant owner a few minutes ago. All we know is that we can open on the 18THPat, I always ignore headlines and read the full article.Edited: 11:35 am, May 08, 2020 "
A restaurant owner posted the full regulation on another forum. All ten pages of them.
"You have it on the link on my post#6, but in portuguese."
"PT. That is my point.Ten pages not the single page published by safe communities. As one restaurant owner said, without the sufficient number of customers the regulations may not make it worth opening. Another, small restaurants where staff multi task will find it very difficult to conform.The devil is in the detail, how will the relevant authorities have sufficient resources to ensure that everywhere that opens is meeting the new regulations which are for the safety of customers and staff."
"At a quick read there would be no point in going out to meet friends as, if I read correctly, you would have to be sitting 2 metres apart, presumably spread across several tables and communicating by phone rather than actually speaking face to face. Can restaurants demand ID to prove that a group is 'co-habitants' and not friends or even family living in different towns?'Avoid touching unnecessary surfaces'? Would someone please define what these might be?With such a raft of regulations which many customers (particularly tourists) may not fully appreciate along with the risk of being closed down by the zealots, is it worth opening?"
