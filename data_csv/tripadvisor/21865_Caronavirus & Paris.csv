Hi everyone.My 25 year old daughter and I are planning to travel to Paris on March 2nd. What is the update about the virus in the French capital? Are all museums and attractions opens as usual? Is Paris experiencing a lot of cancellations? Are people walking around with masks on?Please update me... I am a touch concerned.Thanks
Have you scrolled through the countless threads on the same topic below?
"A poster just finished a 7 day live trip report of their Paris visit on the forum I can't recall they mentioned any concerns, they even extended their stay an extra day or two so they could attend a football game with 10,000 other people. Google and YouTube videos are showing major attractions with no lines since most people concerned staying home.Google your title and see today's news. France has 5 cases as of today. 5 versus 50 million.."
"If you are in relatively good health and not elderly, even if you do get exposed to it, you might not have any effects, let alone severe effects. It's actually far less deadly than the 'regular' flu, so if you wouldn't worry about the flu, don't worry too much about coronavirus. Just take some basic precautions:Avoid close contact with people who are sick.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.While masks may help a sick person avoid infecting others, they don't help you avoid becoming infected. (And in my opinion, they increase the 'end-of-the-world hysteria that's already in evidence.)"
"In addition, to the responses thus far, I suggest you also consult with people in medical communities/forums.Although, COVID-19 is said to be less dangerous than flu but it did not have any dilatory effect on the rise of global trepidation."
"As FS Susan said above, take precautions when traveling. At this point, the exposure is not widespread. Will it become so remains to be seen.The latest about deaths from Coronavirus in France:""A second person suffering from coronavirus has died in France, and a Frenchman who travelled to Italy's Lombardy region also tested positive, the country's health authorities said on Wednesday.The death was one of three new cases in France this week, said Jerome Salomon, the country's director-general of health, and an infectious disease specialist.There are now 17 confirmed cases in the country."""
"Does no one ever scan the forum before hitting the post button?There are several threads on the same topic just on the first page, why start another?"
"17 cases... well that bell curve went hyperbolic rather quickly.1, 2, 5, 17... in a week. Do I have to go shopping, I really have no time to fight the masses."
"As of yesterday there was officially no more coronavirus infected person in hospital in France, how long will that last i don't know. But attractions are open as usual, fewer chinese tourists around that s all"
The Corona is in fact not 'less deadly than the flu' -- the flu has a death rate of .1% and corona so far looks to have a death rate of 2 or 3% i.e. much more lethal. To survive a severe case people need ventilators and other intensive care which if thousands are seriously ill will simply not be available.Travel exposes you to more potential to pick up a virus like this.We are flying to Paris April 1 and are waiting to late March to decide if we kiss off the thousands it will cost us to cancel to see where things are then. No one knows the extent to which the disease is already circulating within France or the US because there are not ready mean to test. In the US they have only tested people with China connections because there are not adequate tests for other suspicious cases.
Thanks for your detailed response
">>Travel exposes you to more potential to pick up a virus like this.<<Aside from airplane travel, does this hold true if you do comparable activities at home as traveling... dining out, theater, sightseeing... and stay in a vacation rental instead of a hotel? I would think if your destination has a comparable number of cases as your home area, the risk would be relatively similar."
"The number of cases doubled in France today. The semi-marathon was cancelled for tomorrow, as well as the last day of the huge agriculture show.Paris itself has very few cases at the moment, but that will change."
"In your home town you are less likely to come into contact with people who have recently been in Korea, Italy, Japan etc -- travel is inherently more risky.It is going to cost us thousands to cancel as travel insurance doesn't cover epidemics but we may find ourselves needing to cancel in the next couple of weeks."
Thank you for your post Janet. I am in similar situation and will take the same approach as my travel date looms near.It's a bummer !!
"Janet, I am sorry to hear that. A few days ago, I would have encouraged you to travel here anyway, but the situation is getting scarier, as I am sure you know."
"For updates on Coronavirus in France , I regularly access www.thelocal.frIt's in English and very helpful."
">> In your home town you are less likely to come into contact with people who have recently been in Korea, Italy, Japan etc -- travel is inherently more risky. <<True for many, but not so much if you live in Orlando, NYC, or other places with a heavy foreign tourist presence."
"The French Government have been giving a daily update on the number of cases at 19.00 each evening.As per yesterday's update, most of the 100 cases where in and around the town of Creil, in the Oise region.https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/maladies-…"
"Hi everyone, thanks so much for posting your comments. Since our flights are for tomorrow night, I have decided to forfeit our Easyjet flights and not fly to Paris. I am less concerned about catching the virus myself but being stuck in Paris if there is a serious outbreak, or being quarantined when I return home. I am also concerned that I may catch the virus, be asymptomatic and then cause others to become sick.... I am sure that this will be behind us in a few more months and there will be plenty of more opportunities to fly and without any major health concerns. Thanks again everyone and wishing all of you good health and many more wonderful travels."
"May is a long time away....wait and see what happens. Right now the only illness-related issue in Paris is high anxiety, not actual cases of disease."
"""I am less concerned about catching the virus myself but being stuck in Paris if there is a serious outbreak, or being quarantined when I return home.""It's been a thought of mine since the beginning.. At least you waited last minute to decide Jeanette. Come back another time. In the meantime... Google results say a brothel in Valencia Spain has been put on quarantine including 119 customers and staff."
"Apparently the Louvre shut-down right now is considered temporary, for meetings to determine best way to protect museum workers who are concerned about exposure to so many visitors; they hope to be able to reopen soon:https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2…So stay tuned for further updates."
The Louvre news probably belongs in the sticky...
For some reason I can't respond to the sticky
"ATF, I was not able to reply to this, or any other, “sticky” from Trip Advisor app.Apparently, as I have now discovered, I can only reply to any “sticky” if using full Trip Advisor website.(“Reply” option just does not appear for any “sticky” when using app) But I have now also posted on the “sticky” as well."
certainly a valid concern for the workers...visitors from all over the world in some rooms with very little room to keep distances....
"For those who are there now, are you seeing fewer people in the restaurants, at the cafes, on the Metro? I know that indoor events at venues of 5,000 seats or more are being canceled. Are hotels reporting cancellations? Are there fewer people on the streets or where people congregate? Thanks."
"I must say, I am feeling very disappointed about not flying to Paris this evening. My daughter and I were counting the days for this Paris trip. But life does get in the way sometimes and ruin our plans. In the big scheme of things, I guess it is not a big deal. Just hoping that this coronavirus is behind us soon. It is creating havoc around the world and could bring us to a huge recession which will have a domino effect on all of our lives.... uncertain times indeed."
"aklein1022, I will go in to Paris tomorrow and answer your question. Out here in the suburbs it's fairly normal. My kids said the movie cinema was pretty full yesterday and the Chinese food was yummy. They wash their hands now as a knock on effect from the scare. Two of our friends are refusing cheek to cheek kissing. Paris tomorrow! Wish me luck, my hazemat suit matches my scarf.)"
"I was away for the weekend in London where everything is businesss as usual. Last week in Paris things were quiet, mostly because the thousands of Chinese tourists who come/go to Paris each day are stuck at home. In general, people don't seem too bothered by any potential risk, except for the security at the Louvre. They aren't about to miss an opportunity to take the time off. Also found tons of hand sanitizer (yes, I know washing is better, but wanted a small one because I've got a ton of train travel coming up) in Paris, whereas that was all sold out in London.Edited: 7:31 am, March 02, 2020 "
"** Paris tomorrow! Wish me luck, my hazemat suit matches my scarf **Very impressive. Please do give us signed autographs :-)"
"my scheduled paris visit is on 7th march, a bit concerned regarding coronavirus spread.any one other visiting paris from india in march 1st or 2nd week??"
The Louvre is closed As of March 1 due to corona virus fears
So you decided not to go? Or were you told you can’t? I am having the same experience. My daughter and I are to go in 11 days and I don’t know what to do
"I am due to fly to Paris in 2 days - at present i am still intending to go as as of yet, there are no travel restrictions advised. Fingers crossed this will stay this way & there will not be many more confirmed cases."
"Still 'wait and watch ' and calculating personal risk, most likely will not travel if confirmed cases get up from now"
"My husband and I are flying Wed as well! We will wait until Wed morning to decide if we keep plans or cancel. Our concern is not as much catching the virus but complications if we get quarantined, or is the US or France decides to close borders."
What happens in that case?
"France government has said closing borders is a logistical nightmare so it's off the front burners until further notice. ABC news is reporting that the largest popup hospital in Wuhan China is closing due to everyone is being discharged as 2 week quarantine are running dry of infected people.Which can be interpreted how...? Just a few weeks ago according to hundreds of citizen videos from Wuhan showed people dropping dead while simply standing.Edited: 1:13 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"I have personally not noticed any differences in Paris, but I have not been to any tourist sites either.Today, I went to see my Chinese ophthalmologist and she was wearing a mask, but she might do that regularly. I had not been for 7 years, so I wouldn't know."

Please keep updating on the situation there because i my trip is on Mar 15 and i am totally confused whether i have to cancel the trip or not. What musuems are closed as of now??
"The Louvre is closed for a strike, not by any government decision."
I’m traveling March 12th. No plans to cancel at this time.
"I'm in Paris right now. I flew in on Saturday from Heathrow after flying in from Miami the same day (I live in the States). I'm flying to Madrid tomorrow morning until the weekend when I'll return to Miami.It's been raining here the last couple of days, so that affects people out and about. I can say I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary this weekend. I come to Paris every year and have been doing so for years, so I have a wee bit of context. With the exception of the Louvre closed, I didn't really notice the crowds being any lighter (in tourist attractions, neighborhoods, and metro.Now, I don't know if I'm am idiot for traveling now and being cautious, but not too concerned with this. I suppose I'll find out soon enough!My wife's work did email her today and asked her to self-quarantine for 14 days when she gets back. I'm concerned that I am not more concerned about the virus."
"#42 said:""Which can be interpreted how...? Just a few weeks ago according to hundreds of citizen videos from Wuhan showed people dropping dead while simply standing.""Favor please, can we knock off with snark every time you post? This is a serious topic. There are less new cases of coronavirus in Wuhan which is why the popups can close. That is VERY good news. So far there have been more than 3,000 deaths from the virus, mostly in China, and there are still thousands of active cases. Sorry to vent, but my niece who has a compromised immune system is living in Washington where several deaths have occurred. We're not joking over here."
"Google: British Airways Ryanair CancellationsAt first glance of Google results titles it appears they are temporarily shutting down many flights to many destinations.If you have not bothered to see the videos of what is happening in Wuhan then wait to comment until you do so. It is over the top. Zero snark.Edited: 4:37 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"ATF, flight cancellations may also be reflecting recent moves by businesses worldwide to curtail international travel, as well as cancellations or postponements of international business conferences."
"It's time to step away from the headlights. A handheld thermometer is 19 bucks on Amazon. If you have a fever then do not pass, fly, enter. Why doesn't the public know what is happening in affected areas is not normal. Twitter, Facebook, etc are suppressing the videos from people that have risked everything for us to see. It's so weird."
"ATF, the problem is that not everyone has a fever initially but may still be contagious. They don’t know yet.The one confirmed Coronavirus case in NYC right now is a 39-year-old woman who just flew back from Iran several days ago before she had any fever or had developed any symptoms at all. She felt just fine until a few days after her return to NYC. She is a health-care worker, as is her husband, who has also now been tested but has had no fever or other symptoms; and his test results have not yet come back. Apparently, although she has been confirmed to have Coronavirus, her symptoms are not very severe, and she is recovering under quarantine at her own home. Her husband is also quarantined in their apt., but so far is not showing any symptoms. People who were on her flight, as well as the car service driver who took her home from the airport, are all being tested. It seems no one is sure yet what the incubation period might be, anywhere from a few days up to 2 weeks.And they are not yet sure how easily the virus spreads to otherwise healthy people who do not have close-proximity contact. Remember that the cluster of cases in the French alps several weeks ago went no further than the few people who had been sharing the chalet with the gentleman who apparently had caught the virus in Singapore; and they all recovered. But the point is that testing for fevers at an airport may not be that effective at stopping travelers who are already incubating the virus."
"#50.Thanks! This is exactly the information I was looking for - the practical, everyday consequences of this situation. I wish more folks - who are on the ground in Paris, would provide details."
"The practical every day consequences today is that the Louvre is closed due to a strike. Large gatherings of 5000+ are banned, so the semi-marathon and a book fair were cancelled. Restaurants are complaining that less people are dining out, so it is easy to get some pretty great reservations. Trains, metros and buses were as crowded as ever this morning. Business are telling employees not to shake hands and everyone is being reminded to wash your hands often.And I don’t have tons of confirmation on this, but everyone I‘ve interviewed is stocking up on basics at home « just in case »."
"#55""Twitter, Facebook, etc are suppressing the videos from people that have risked everything for us to see.""Other than your usual love of conspiracy theories, what objective evidence do you have to support this statement?"
Thanks phread. Great information. Wonder if the lines at the cinema are growing shorter. I trust your perspective. Pls keep posting.
"Adventuretoursinfrance, do you have a vested interest in tourists not cancelling their trips to Paris/France? Your posts just seem to be casting aspersions on other posters' perspectives."
"""do you have a vested interest in tourists not cancelling their trips to Paris/France?"" He's a tour guide...of course not! ;)"
NY TIMES is saying exactly the same thing: https://youtu.be/m5fsidSOJMwDoes this montage look normal: https://youtu.be/gDfj33Y_VHk
"There were only 5 cases in France when I suggested the OP do some more research. I agree with people that have a concern about being stuck and have posted that many times, it is a real concern. I agree with people that Wuhan is deadlier than the common flu.I agree that a 2 week self quarantine for people coming back from infected areas.Anybody here just come back from an infected area? Taipei China for example, how is your 2 week self quarantine going. Can you share what your self quarantine is like? Do the Denver people accept you wearing a mask & gloves without stigma?"
"Jeanette - Sorry you had to cancel. I can imagine the disappointment you're feeling. I have a trip planned for May, and at this point, I have no idea if it will take place."
Taipei (Taiwan) is not an ‘infected’ area.....
"ATF – The NYTimes video does not show people dying while standing in line, as you claim is happening. It does show a very crowded hospital scene that look scary to us, but have you been to a hospital in China? My friend lives in Beijing. Two years ago she showed me a photo of her hospital visit for a routine vaccine. It could have been the same photo, minus the masks. Things are different there. The woman crying hysterically? Yes, that happens when we loose a loved one, or learn we have an illness, and that does tend to happen in hospitals. I have a lot of friends and colleagues living and WORKING in China right now. Nobody is hysterical and people are not dropping like flies. The video is really about the people demanding freedom of speech in China, which is another question entirely.As for the other video, I did not bother because who knows who Christian is and why/how he made that video. Your sensationalization and demonization of what is going on in China is actually quite medieval.ALSO Taipei isin TAIWAN. Taiwan is NOT China At least, not yet. Serioussly, man, you are clearly not an expert.Edited: 5:22 am, March 03, 2020 "
"From Google... TAIPEI — Among the 5 million people who fled the novel coronavirus-affected Chinese city of Wuhan during the Lunar New Year holiday, 7,515 headed to Taiwan, according to Chinese news outlet yicai.com, as reported by UDN on Tuesday (Jan. 28).The figures were announced by Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang (周先旺) on Sunday (Jan. 26), causing concern about the wider spread of the virus. Using Baidu maps and big data analysis, yicai.com determined that from Dec. 30 to Jan. 22, 7,515, passengers flew to Taiwan — including 3,696 to Taoyuan, 2,698 to Kaohsiung, and 1,121 to Songshan Airport in Taipei."

I've got a better chance of being run over by a bus
"According to your article, the people stopped going fro Wuhan to Taiwan on Jan 22. We are now March 3. Incubation period has come and gone. There are only 34 cases in Taiwan (which is NOT China and DOES have free speech). My head is not in the sand. I have regular contact with non government employees living in a variety of cities across China at this moment. I would suggest getting your head out of the virtual vortex.As for the other video. It is NOT a reliable source."
"Any reliable source is not showing all the videos, just cherry picking ones from the other link proving the point. Why not show them all. And why is showing all the videos from the citizens profiteering on Paris tours. That's doesn't make any sense. Am I suppose to cherry pick my experience in Paris today to make Paris scary or fun.."
"Currently standing in the middle of the Champs Élysées, looking at the Arc de Triomphe, a supermarket and an occasional hop on hop off bus driving by. Oh and a constant flow of people walking everywhere. Oh and the scooter people. And bikes. And a busy bakery, Chinese takeaway, taxis, and a guy blowing his nose in a tissue."

"I'm apparently the Taiwan guy-but as pointed out, Taiwan is not the PRC.

By the way, the virus was invented by Bill Gates and the Queen of England.This is the sort of stuff he routinely writes in his posts. So it's pretty clear he has a conspiracy laden, fact-free agenda(i.e. he often cites youtube as his authority), so it's up to our gentle readers to decide his credibility.It's all nonsense, but he clearly has unlimited time to post, so expect more.Edited: 12:26 pm, March 03, 2020 "

Again, intelligent and caring for others well being. Guilty I am.

"Well at least you admit your nonsense is nonsense.1. What, exactly, is your obsession with Bill Gates? Do you really believe he invented this virus?

hrt gonna get to the bottom of the issue with AVT.

"Yes, just checked in for our flights! Still somewhat concerned but based on the number of cases not substantially changing in France between yesterday and today, along with WHO statement today and US state department not issuing statement to reconsider travel, right now best course of action."

"Thanks to everyone for taking the time to post on this issue. Hopefully we can continue to be respectful of everyone and have an informed discussion. No one should be judged for deciding to cancel a trip - or in the alternative to go! Our family is scheduled to arrive in Paris on 3/21 and have until 3/19 to cancel our hotel. We understand that the definition of a pandemic is that it is everywhere and that choosing to cancel our trip does not in anyway guarantee we will not contract the Coronavirus. We live in the Chicago area and several people have just tested positive - we know it's coming. Here are some of issues we are factoring in making our decision: 1. We do not want to risk being quarantined in another country. We are traveling with our daughters but our 15 and 19 year old sons are not coming. We want to make sure that we can always get back to them.2. We don't want to be sick on vacation. Being sick means not being able to enjoy outings, meals, etc.. It happens and sometimes it's unavoidable. But while there is a lot we don't know about this virus it is seems highly contagious so we need to be realistic about that.3. One way to minimize the risk of contracting the virus is to avoid public, crowded places. We don't want to go to Paris and not be able to go on the Metro, attend a concert, visit a museum, etc. 4. Even if we want to go to public events / spaces that may not be an option. The Louvre is closed, the Paris Book Fair which we hoped to attend has been cancelled, etc.. 5. While we are healthy we have extended family who are elderly / immune compromised. We don't want to increase the chances of these people contracting the disease. Again - they could get it in Chicago or we could get it and give it to them. But in Chicago we can choose to stay home as much as possible to minimize the chances - we don't want to do that in Paris!For all these reasons we are leaning toward rescheduling our trip. It is not a decision that we are making lightly. We are not panicking but rather trying to do the best we can with the information we have. We don't judge anyone who makes a different decision and hope no one will judge us. We are all doing the best we can under difficult and uncertain circumstances. I've learned so much from this forum and look forward a trip to Paris as soon as it makes sense!"
"<< 4. Even if we want to go to public events / spaces that may not be an option. The Louvre is closed, >>The Louvre has reopened."
Very thoughtful post #92. Pretty much my thoughts exactly as I look ahead to my visit with my wife starting April 20. I believe that’s far enough out for things to settle and become clearer; at least I hope so.
"We are also scheduled to arrive on March 21st. My thought is to go regardless. We would have to modify our plans based on any cancellations but feel that would be better than forfeiting the trip altogether. I can't help but feel anything and everything can happen between now and then and am mentally preparing myself for the disappointment of an impending cancellation... but am happy to hear that the Louvre reopen, if nothing else a symbollic positive sign. Any anecdotal reports from the boots on the ground is VERY appreciated.In the grand scheme of things a cancelled vacation is a first world problem, and my thoughts are with those suffering with the illness and the loss of loved ones."
To be honest I feel like at this stage with the virus everywhere I will just continue with my trip next week.
"** No one should be judged for deciding to cancel a trip **@momtwofour 4: Passing a judgment about your decision would be brazen, contemptuous and incomprehensible.Best of luck and stay well.Edited: 7:40 am, March 04, 2020 "
Best disclaimer ever #92.Best accolades ever #98.
For me personally the hysteria around Cornavirus does not match the real threat from the virus particularly if you aren't in a high risk group. I do plan to go in a week's time and won't be overly concerned unless things get dramatically worse. I will take reasonable precautions such as hand sanitizing and washing.
@92 very well thought out...with France's cases going up I am not sure the stress factor is worth it...rescheduling if that is possible seems reasonable. The proximity and still open borders between Italy and France etc.make it crazy to think France might not be the next hard hit...as well as US. Watching this as have travel plans in the summer and no one really knows how long this will last. Good luck.
Just to put the Coronavirus in some perspective About 3 to 5 million cases of severe flu illness per year and about 250 000 to 500 000 flu season deaths worldwide occur due to the influenza virus according to World Health Organization estimates.
The constant comparison to flu is really not that relevant. We have immunizations and know treatments for the flu....this one they have nothing and most experts agree it is more virulent.
"Here is a link that the fatality rate is in fact falling due to an understanding of the disease and how to treat it. In no way do I want to minimize it or dismiss its seriousness, but just want to balance some of the concerns perhaps.https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/20…"
"Momtwofour4, great summary, my thoughts as well. I have wanted to go to France for 30 years, and am inclined to continue with our trip, however...Our family is scheduled to leave March 13. My college daughter is coming with us, as is our 12 year old. My additional concerns:1. Self-quarantine of my college daughter is unrealistic due to timing of exams, and school’s attendence policy. She lives in a dorm with 2 other roommates. We don’t want to potentially be the source of exposure to the college.2. My husband has a work conference in Nashville (another potential place of exposure) the day after we return, which I am supposed to join him at. Again, don’t really want to be the source of exposure, or to be exposed.3. Our 12 year old is scheduled to stay with my sister-in-law while we’re in Nashville, but has a pregnant daughter-in-law. When our nephew came back from South Korea 1-1/2 weeks ago (early from his study abroad as his school was calling for a mandatory 2-week self-quarantine in their dorms upon setting foot on campus), we made him self-quarantine. The couple that are expecting said they don’t want to see him for a month, so my sister-in-law likely won’t want my daughter staying with them for the same reason. (It is an option for me to stay home from Nashville instead, and I’m leaning towards doing that.)I truly think, as we are all healthy, that we should go. I do believe that while we may contract this virus, our risk for serious illness is low. However, if everything in the world shut down for 2 weeks, couldn’t we get past this with little impact?In the meantime, still deciding up to the point I can still cancel some of my reservations."
"the constant flu comparison is ridiculous None of us has immunity to Covid and there is no treatment especially if the number of cases overwhelms availability of respirators. It appears to be more lethal than the flu and there is no vaccine. The fatality rate for people vaccinated for the flu is very low even if they get the disease. If Covid becomes as widespread as flu, which is probably will, then you can compare the two.We may or may not travel in April. One factor is that the US has so bungled the response -- we can't even test for it because of the lack of preparedness to deal with it even with a two month warning, that we may actually be safer in France."
"@Janettravels44 I would invite you to read the article posted above which shows why the Coronavirus fatality rate is falling dramatically.Edited: 11:09 am, March 04, 2020 "
"From linked article about CHINA:""Still, it's worth noting that even after China got the death rate down to 0.7%, or even 0.4%, that's still about four to seven times greater than the death rate for seasonal flu. (The rate for the flu is about 0.1% — or 1 in 1,000 patients.)""We shall see how this bug acts, but it seems to me this is anecdotal about Wuhan and surrounding areas. We don't know enough about the virus to be able to say it will act the same way in the U.S. or Italy, or wherever, do we??Edited: 12:14 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"@scsix2013 Don't you think now that countries know what they are dealing with, instead of a new unreported virus that China first dealt with in January, that you expect the fatality rate would be stable around 4% or even fall. What would give you cause to think it would increase? I am just trying to provide facts and be less alarmist than some prefer to be. The difference between 0.4 and 0.1 percent is negligible. (1 death in 1000 infected, versus 4 in 100 infected).Edited: 12:28 pm, March 04, 2020 "
4 in 1000 that should be typo...my apologies
"** We don't know enough about the virus to be able to say .............**I agree. While the medical community is grappling to delineate the COVID-19 outbreak, despotic leaders demagogue against the fear of the pandemic and the pious relies on benediction in pursuit of Coronavirus salvation, I recommend the following video for those concerned travelers with upcoming travel plan:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4qvO0StKto"
"""Don't you think now that countries know what they are dealing with..."" (shrug)""What would give you cause to think it would increase?"" Nothing! And nothing would give me cause to think it will get smaller, either. @F8086 Like 99% of folks on this Forum, I have NO idea! I sell stuff for a living, I am not a doctor or scientist and I would caution against making assumptions about this situation until there is a lot more information available."
The rate is about 9% in the US right now due to the failure to test. i.e. we report many fewer cases than probably actually exist. It is unlikely to fall below 1% which is 10 times higher than flu -- and if there is a massive epidemic it is likely to be much higher because the US doesnt have ICU facilities necessary to support recovery in severe cases.i.
"Not to mention the fact that the two U.S. Senators from Washington state who questioned Mike Pence and his group yesterday came away from that meeting feeling very uneasy about the situation here in the States, and felt they did not get useful answers. The ""president"" is concerned only about how he will look, and that is a recipe for disaster. They do not/will not have enough ventilators, etc if it gets worse...."
Tis article is pretty good:https://www.thelocal.fr/20200304/should-i-ca…Mostly stuff that's been discussed here. One interesting tidbit though:>> Air France announced on Wednesday that anyone who wants to cancel their flight between now and May 31st due to coronavirus fears can do so free of charge.<<
@115 Most airlines are saying that you can change and rebook for travel prior to May 31 2020 without charge. I think that is probably the same with Air France.
"Here in France, France 24 says doctors are mad at their superiors for lack of masks, hence the government now doing damage control on what masks do exist are being held for virus related emergencies. Google masks france for stories like this: https://www.thelocal.fr/20200304/french-gove…The CDC appears to have bungled up the USA from the start if you google ""cdc test kits faulty"" it shows the NY Times, Forbes, Wall street Journal all reporting on the CDC snafu. One example: https:/…62947be3670eApparently another snafu being called infamous goes like this according to Science Magazine: In what is already an infamous snafu, CDC initially refused a request to test a patient in Northern California who turned out to be the first probable COVID19 case without known links to an infected person.Meanwhile another cruise is stuck called the Grand Princess, from the captain: Dear Princess Guest: I wish to advise you that today we have been notified by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that they are investigating a small cluster of COVID-19 (coronavirus) cases in Northern California connected to our previous Grand Princess voyage that sailed roundtrip San Francisco from February 11 to February 21. We are working closely with our CDC partners and are following their recommendations.And from the NY Times saying Trump was furious they brought back those infected people back to the USA: https:/…trump-coronavirus-cruise-ship.htmlBringing infected people back to the USA was probably a bad idea.."
"Loonbaby - wow - we are also traveling with our college aged daughter and our 12 year old daughter. We are scheduled to fly out on the 20th so 1 week after you. Such a strange coincidence. In another reality we could have been exchanging our itineraries! I really hope it works out for you to go - please keep us posted.Edited: 5:09 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"Not to make light of this serious subject (I am going to Naples, Sicily and Malta in May and am a bit concerned), but we in Melbourne (5 million people) have got this thing sussed. In *all* of our supermarkets, the following have been completely sold out - empty shelves: toilet paper, face tissues, hand sanitiser, soap. St Vincent de Paul published a list of what is needed to keep you going if you have to stay home for 14 days. I expect to see people with that list in their hands shopping at the supermarkets soon! I'm going out now to stock up on Vegemite.Edited: 6:23 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"Not exactly Paris (this happened in Marseilles) but shows how nervous many people in France are......can’t imagine this type of “heist” would happen if there weren’t already a lucrative black market in masks:2,000 surgical masks stolen from French hospitalrfi.fr/en/france/20200304-2000-coronavirus-s…"
"Confusion !Everyone have the same either to proceed with the bookings or cancel the plan or reschedule.Plenty of things creating hype on social media, news etc.Few suggests to go head, few advice to re-think the plan.Even I have my booking for second week of May 20.Though this may come down / go up, we are not sure how it’s going to effect us, and how many attractions in my fifteen day trip may be effected, how many restrictions might be emerging during the travel, many of site seeing places may be closed for a while, even after returning fifteen days quarantine is to much for my regular works if any thing goes wrong.. keeping all this I have cancelled all my bookings as I have 60 day prior cancel option with 5% deduction on my total package.If everything goes fine I can visit all the things at a later time Life is first of everything, Life is beautiful , live and enjoy, if we are fine we can do anything later after things are set fine.Money is not only the things, moments are most important, if you really would like to risk, help the community suffering.After all the trip to be done with happiness but not worries..This is my personal opinion, and may not be sweet full to everyone...Take your own decision ..Wish you a happy time always!!"
"Lovel post, rajuashetty. I hope you can reschedule your trip to Paris sometime soon."
"LoveSunny - the lucrative black market for masks is global, It is an issue everywhere with verified cases in Silver Springs, NY , London, NY and across the globe (merci Amazon.com!)"
"** 2,000 surgical masks stolen from French hospital **Lamentably, the scarcity of gloves, masks and other sanitary products reported in many parts of the world (not limited only to France).The supply and the demand chain caught by surprise and it will take time to stabilize.The frightening part are the countries govern by oligarchs, where they hoard stocks at warehouses to drive up prices."
"Yesterday, France decreed that only doctors and medical professionals can buy masks freely. Anybody else must present a medical prescription at the pharmacy.Also, the price of hand sanitizer has been blocked, because there was so much price gouging (especially on sites like Amazon).."
My supermarket pasta shelves are empty today but that's it so far.And this from TIME magazine is what it is...New Hampshire Coronavirus Patient Breaks Quarantine to Attend Dartmouth Eventhttps:/…
"From my perspective unless something changes dramatically the risk is negligible. My family and I are looking forward to Paris next week. We will take reason precautions including sanitizing and hand washing, but don't feel the threat is pervasive or something that would make us not visit."
"Turns out the OP from Israel made the right call according to mainstream news yesterday.""Israel on Wednesday ordered a two-week quarantine on people arriving from France, Germany, Spain, Austria and Switzerland over coronavirus fears, after imposing similar measures on Italy and several Asian states."" https://www.france24.com/en/20200304-israel-…I went back to the supermarket and whatever sparked the panic on pasta didn't last long, they restocked every variety so scampi is back on."
Next month’s Paris Marathon has now been “postponed”....https:/…
"ATF,The motto on NH's license plate is ""Live Free or Die"". Apparently this guy doesn't care who he takes with him."
"People, take the singnal. Global governments, big companies are cancelling events and prohibite employee travelling. What you see on the surface(normal outings, business as usual...)doesn't mean anything now, wait 14 days, if everyone is still good and healthy,that's the real time to say everything is good. But who knows future now? A week ago, someone mentioned that there were only 28 cases in France and not in Paris mostly, but hey look at today's number, 300+!"
"France24 mentions a RATP agent tested positive after coming back from infected Mulhouse area last month, and I guess we're about to learn what Level 3 means, they're using the words probably & potentially: https://www.france24.com/en/20200306-french-…Maybe something encouraging at CNBC quoting Pasteur Institute a new discovery of 2 strains of virus going around, 1 strain from Wuhan being really really really bad and a new strain that is less aggressive. It might make the disparity of reports sense. From CNBC: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/04/coronavirus-…Miss Marley I always loved that motto from New Hampshire. Of note, the NH hospital worker infected with a positive test of the virus escaped to Dartmouth Business School in White River Junction, Vermont. I am guilty just thinking about this escapee."
"This won't matter in a day or two when we reach level 3, but the two main centers of infection are Oise (Compiègne area) and Haut-Rhin (Mulhouse area).The number of cases in Mulhouse was multiplied by 8 yesterday, and the reason is exactly the same as how things got started in South Korea -- an evangelistic gathering.Yesterday when I went to the movies in Paris, one of the ticket takers was wearing disposable gloves. Today the ticket takers at the same place were not even touching the tickets -- they just looked at them as you walked by."
"The Mulhouse gathering is also the source of the first recorded cases in Corsica and French Guyana (and Val de Loire I think, and also the first RATP agent found infected)."
A friend in Paris got the impression today there was a manifestation strike today as his street was full with people walking everywhere and buses packed above a typical normal day. This was the Montparnasse area.I am going to Paris on Sunday for a day of sightseeing so we'll see if this is a metro virus phobia thing.
"No need to wait until Sunday. I live here. People who can are cycling or walking to work to avoid contamination. Haven’t noticed the buses, but taxis are thrill that locals are making up the loss from less tourism."
I continue to take the metro and it is as crowded as ever;
"Thanks phread and kerouac2. You’re on site posts are greatly appreciated. Hard to get a picture of what Paris is going through in a practical manner, without them. Keep them coming. Merci"
