"Saw a Josh Green (Lt Gov) presser the other day where he said Hawaii was watching Alaska's plan closely (which started this weekend) and could be the foundation for Hawaii's entry requirements...https:/…Personally, I do not take issue with getting a 72 hour, pre-boarding test. However, I have been researching this and from what I am seeing, getting such a test fully completed within that timeframe may not be as easy as one thinks. Over time and as the testing process matures, I guess that could change.If you weren't able to get results back within the 72 hour timeframe, upon arrival you would have to take another test, then self quarantine on island until those results were returned. If negative, your quarantine would be over. If positive, I guess you have some problems."
Not true anymore. Anyone can get a test and results back the same day. I was required to get a test before a colonoscopy. Took 20 minutes in my car and had results in one hour.
"It depends on the test itself, and even the best have a pretty so-so failure rate (5%-10% is one stat I've seen many times).The Abbott test was considered the best until people in the WH tested positive after being cleared by it day after day. Another issue is that they still say around 35% of the people with CV-19 are asymptomatic. An Oahu resident flew to Alaska the other day-and was ""busted"" on landing. Diagnosed with CV-19. While they've been discussing this idea and some others, I think the best plan would be a test 3 days before departure and one on landing. That would at least cover a little more of the period a person could be infected. But then you still have the ""what then"" problem. If someone tests positive 3 days ahead or on landing--what happens to their money they've paid? Will the airlines agree to refunds for any positive test 3 days out, for example? What about lodgings-will private rentals refund? But overall, we will have to learn to live with this. As time and testings capabilities go on and perhaps better reliability, we should not see huge spikes due to travel. Right now is a mystery, IMO."
"""Not true anymore. Anyone can get a test and results back the same day.""In California, you mean?"
"""Not true anymore. Anyone can get a test and results back the same day. I was required to get a test before a colonoscopy. Took 20 minutes in my car and had results in one hour.""I would guess this to be a state/regional test availability you are in. I would also presume you were given a Drs recommendation to get the test as part of the procedure? what about a person in good health and not within the spectrum of susceptibility?I have been researching testing in my area (Oregon) and most places are requiring you to fill out an online form for pre-test approval. When I fill out a form to check for authorization, I am not eligible to get a test.The Abbott tests in Oregon seem like they are more available in rural communities due to their distant proximity from a processing lab as the samples taken require certain transport care in order to keep the specimen intact."
Plus Alaska's rules say the rapid tests aren't acceptable.
"Longboard has repeatedly mentioned the easy availability of testing, but that isn’t reality everywhere. And as noted, the rapid test results are often not valued anyway.~ ColleenEdited: 2:21 am, June 08, 2020 "
Right!
"Decided to hop over to the Alaska Travel TA forum on how the entry testing process is going:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g28923…https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g28923…The second one is pretty lengthy and full of back and forths. It seems there are many things unclear and hopefully if Hawaii adopts them, smooths them out and communicates the exact requirements.A few things still unclear:Getting tested/results 72 hours before departure:Does departure time mean your origination or the actual flight departure that arrives on the islands?What if your departure is late?From what I surmised, if whichever departure time is the accepted one, if it couases your test results to be older than 72 hours, you would automatically fall into the category of the 3-5 day test results requiring you to again be tested on arrival and self quarantine on island until those results received.What tests are accepted?SARS-CoV2 PCR and it does not sound like these are the quick tests available at pharmacies, etc? However, the person that wrote the first hand account (first link above) did say he had a Walgreens test that was acceptable. It just sounds like all Walgreens tests are not the same across the board.It also seems like the whole process, upon entry, would greatly slow down arrival processing. I have a hard time imagining the people checking paperwork doing 'head' math on departure times with factors such as time-zones involved.Edited: 2:58 pm, June 09, 2020 "
"The PCR tests vary in accuracy and quality too. Some medical resources say they miss one in five cases.Some good points, Craig."
"Tests are available. If there is a problem in your state, they need to fix it.  If your state requires a doctor referral, all that means is they are letting doctors who have nothing to do with the test get a cut of the action. We need to move forward. We just can not keep printing money."
"""If your state requires a doctor referral, all that means is they are letting doctors who have nothing to do with the test get a cut of the action.""That's the first time I have ever heard that …."
"Me, too, placebets. And I sure wish certain poster(s) would stop stating or assuming that the whole USA has the same policies and options that their segment of Cal. has."
There should be an IQ test for entry into the Islands 'cause we don't want no dummies coming here. And there should be a questionnaire asking how much you intend to spend and tip 'cause we don't want no cheapskate 10% tippers neither!

">>>just hope you realize that about half of the people that live in Hawaii are dumber than average don't you ?<<<I was being funny. You're just being mean, you old placebets, you. : - )Then again, they're smart enough to live in Hawai'i!"
">>>I just hope you realize that about half of the people that live in Hawaii are dumber than average don't you ?>>>Here in Southern California, half the people are smarter than average"
"""I just hope you realize that about half of the people that live in Hawaii are dumber than average don't you ?""Wow, placebets, that was rude, inappropriate and has no basis in actual fact."
"Placebets, that is out of line. BTW--6 more new cases today, all on Oahu. Plus the one from yesterday, Oahu is setting an ugly new record over the last five days.I'm really starting to wish the interisland quarantine wasn't being lifted next week........and I know I'm not the only one."
"I don't believe placebets was trying to be mean. Just a very dry sense of humor directed at kaukau.Hope they don't lift the inter island quarantine. Coming from Kauai and going through Oahu to Maui could be risky but I'm willing to take it!! Hubby really needs a vacation. But, good cancellation policies on all of it if need be."
Don't you mean you hope they *DO* lift it?Did you see HA is having a big sale?
"""I don't believe placebets was trying to be mean. Just a very dry sense of humor directed at kaukau.""I agree. He could make the same joke about any place.Reminiscent of the normal distribution of data or a bell curve, a mean."
"I agree with a test requirement before boarding the plane. However, if you test positive and you are not allowed to board the plane, what happens to your resort reservation and airplane tickets? Will you get a full refund? I’ve been looking for this information and I cannot find it anywhere,"
">>>I agree with a test requirement before boarding the plane. However, if you test positive and you are not allowed to board the plane, what happens to your resort reservation and airplane tickets?

"You can’t find the info anywhere, Irina, because it doesn’t yet exist, and because no one knows. While I realize people are trying to creatively come up with “solutions” to the air travel conundrum, I think it’s foolhardy to believe we can create a safety buffer around ourselves. I can get on a plane with 200 people, all of whom recently tested negative for Covid. Who’s to say the testing & results are accurate. Who knows what other viruses some of hem may be sharing during the flight. Which isn’t to analogize this coronavirus with an unrelated influenza (or whatever). Only to say that I think many people want false assurances in this scenario, even as they accept all manner of other uncontrollable risks. ~ ColleenEdited: 6:22 pm, June 10, 2020 "

Brian L - I really am doubting that ….
"Placebets, it looks like TA staff removed your post. That means someone or more than one person wrote to TA. It's not clickers."
"flowerlover glad to see you have an understanding of high level math and statistics. Thanks for the help. Some people are way too sensitive sometimes.And I was not being mean !Edited: 8:43 pm, June 10, 2020 "
"And 4 more new cases on Oahu today................I think everyone on Oahu should be forced to go to Texas, LOL!!!!!"
"SW then that's even more ridiculous ! Thanks for pointing that out.SW we don't have room for everyone from Oahu here, half of California is already moving here and we are about out of space.Edited: 8:46 pm, June 10, 2020 "
How about if we just send you all the people who want to visit Maui?
"Fwiw, placebets, I read your now-removed post as dry humor, but then, I tend that way myself. Alas, doesn’t always come across well via a screen.~ Colleen"
Why would anyone in their right mind want to move to Texas? Although I did like Austin but it's weird like that!!
"jplrk - yep, just kidding around. I can't imagine why someone doesn't just reply rather than go run tell the teacher ! SW sure send them here and tell them its a lot like Maui without all the water and palm trees.fishdiva - I kind of agree. Austin Is very popular but I lived there for a while and it's not really for me either. I would probably not stay in Texas except my 3 grand daughters live here. But about half of the people in Texas are also dumber than average but in some cities like Austin, it runs quite a bit higher than 50% and it's getting worse every day I think."
That's funny placebets. My daughter and son lived in Austin. Daughter couldn't wait to leave and son never wanted to. Both back in Colorado now. My first granddaughter was born in a town east of Houston.
"Okay, getting off track here, but I’m compelled to defend Texas. Despite leaving a good post-college job in Houston to get back to the PNW, there things there I still think fondly of, lo these many years later. Great food, museums, Memorial Park, proximity to Galveston and New Orleans. At the time it felt to me like a concrete jungle and Seattle was calling me back. I’d stay there longer now!~ ColleenEdited: 9:15 pm, June 10, 2020 "
"#25. ""I think many people want false assurances"" No kidding. Humans are masters of denial.Current covid stastics are reflecting the inflection point brought on by mothers day gatherings. Infections related to Memorial Day and BLM protests await."
When people move from Texas to Hawaii it results in both states getting smarter.
