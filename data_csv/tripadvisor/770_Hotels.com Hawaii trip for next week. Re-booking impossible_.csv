"We are scheduled to visit Kona next week but want to re-book our hotel reservation that we made through hotels.com1. we booked a ""non-refundable""2. we visit website and call to change our dates but there is no answer and no way to change dates. Wait times for online chat are 8 to 10 hours and now, they say to just check back later. When we call, they have ""technical problems"" and hang up the line.3. It appears our only option is to cancel through the hotels.com website. Which we don't want to do since we would lose those funds. So, naturally we want to re-book instead but this is basically impossible.What should we do? Just cancel it and lose the money? Or keep trying to re-book?Other options or am I wrong about how this should work. Any insight appreciated. Thanks!"
Try different times of day and night........also try via Facebook or Twitter if they have accounts.
You might even call the hotel and ask them if they have any insight on what might be able to be done.
"Perhaps they will make an exception due to the virus, but generally non-refundable means you eat that hotel cost. You might try calling the actual hotel you booked that is in Kailua-Kona and see if they can do any rebooking on their end. :)"
"I guess I am most curious about being able to re-book a non-refundable reservation. This is common practice, yes?Right now, I am just unable to get through and do that. So, in theory they should give me a credit if I cancel it through their website? ugh :)"
I wouldn't bet on it.
"""I guess I am most curious about being able to re-book a non-refundable reservation. This is common practice, yes?"" No, it is not. Non-refundable means you can't rebook or get your money back."
"Their website is very clear - not refundable means that ""if you choose to change or cancel this booking, you will not be refunded any of this payment."" When you make that choice at booking, you realize that is what it means and you will eat that cost. Free cancellation is also an option, but apparently you didn't choose that when you make your original booking with hotels.com."

"The hotel actually can’t do anything for you and will likely refer you back to hotels.com.The reason being this: you booked through a third party. Hotels.com actually made the booking with the hotel...they paid the hotel whatever price they have an agreement to pay. They are the hotel’s customer, not you. Any changes you need to make thus have to go through hotels.com. The flexibility of being to work with the hotel directly is one of the things you give up when you book through a third party service like hotels.com."
"Per The Points Guy, Hyatt is allowing cancellation and full refund of non refundable reservations within certain timeframes,https:/…"
"CT, note that it says those reservations had to be made _directly_ with Hyatt. Which is not what happened here."
"Rebooking and refunding are different. There's nothing lost in contacting the hotel directly, they'll see your reservation and might be able, again, to give you some insight. Nothing ventured, nothing gained!!"
"Agree with fish, I would totally call the hotel. Nothing to lose by doing that."
"Although I would also never book on a third party site like this ... it can be fine, but it can also make things really difficult, and not just in this situation."
