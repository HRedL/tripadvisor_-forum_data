"Cabin fever, pent-up demand, whatever you wanna call it. A lot of people showed up at the casinos in South Dakota this past weekend...https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/11/cabin-fever-…"
They will be
Some of those casinos in Deadwood are about the size of my living room lol. Wouldn’t take much to fill them up. :)
"Do you live in a mansion, Irish? ;)"
One of the Deadwood casinos was a bar. With some kind of video slots at 4-5 of the seats. And about a dozen slot machines. That was it.One of the ones mentioned in the article was fairly big. By Deadwood standards. Cadillac Jacks. It was about the size of Casino Royale in Las Vegas I think.
"Lol. Sorry. Have you ever been to Deadwood?? It's a teeny tiny town with a population of about 1300 people. Yes, there are a few casinos, but they are all pretty small. Google tells me the town has a total of about 3400 TOTAL slot machines in about 25 various locations. You do the math. It wouldn't take that many patrons for the place to appear busy.As Irish mentioned, Cadillac Jacks is probably the largest. I have been there, albeit years ago, but if my recollection serves me correct, it is even smaller than Casino Royale.Edited: 11:25 pm, May 11, 2020 "
"Now I want to visit. I love visiting ""small"" towns, as long as they aren't near mine ;)"
"It will take 3-6 months to get back to normal, that will be very good. Foreign visitors come only when borders are open. I’ll be back, but many people are scared to leave the house, they won’t even go out to restaurants when reopened, not only that, they want everybody else to be locked up like them. It will take time, so be it."
^pansies. let's buy 'em all dolls for Christmas.
"Mac, this must be the 100th time you've referred to people who are taking the risks seriously as being ""scared."" People may come to different conclusion is assessing the risk involved. People may have more family and friends who are high risk and thus behave differently than those who don't. There are lots of factors in play that will cause people to decide differently. My father is 78 with a heart condition. Does his caution make him a weak scaredy cat? I have a friend who has chronic leukemia. Do you find his remaining in isolation pathetic too? 70 million people are high risk, are they simply not as brave as you?For you obviously, as you've repeatedly stated, your own ability to go to Vegas trumps any other considerations. While I certainly don't condone this mindset, I'm not going to try and convince you otherwise. But I've got to say your continued framing of those who don't agree with you as being ""scared"" and therefore weak and cowardly doesn't reflect well on you at all.If your goal here is to get people to respect your opinion, try showing a little respect for those whose circumstances are different than yours.Edited: 1:53 am, May 12, 2020 "
"There is no shame in being scared, I am scared too. Do what you want or need, you don’t need to defend or justify yourself. Don’t lock me up too."
"Not being able to go to a casino until it is safe for all involved, until the tools are in place to effectively protect 70 million high risk people is not ""locking you up."" Effective measures to prevent the spread of a highly contagious disease that's killed over 250,000 people in a matter of months is not a matter of personal choice. To think so isn't just incorrect but stunningly selfish.Being required to participate in stopping a pandemic is not a civil rights issue any more than being forced to wear a seat belt in order to drive is. Freedom from being inconvenienced is not in the Bill of Rights.Edited: 2:57 am, May 12, 2020 "
"I own stocks in MGM, Caesar’s and Sands, I want them to open ASAP. I own properties in Las Vegas, I have casino employees as tenants, I want casinos to open ASAP. I need to sell in show in Las Vegas in July, I want everything to open ASAP."
"Oh my, I apologize. Your stock portfolio should take precedence over the life or death risks 70 million people are facing."
"I think demand will be high, out of all the Vegas forums I use I see lots of people post their roll calls and intent to travel. It's doesn't seem to be putting off the hardcore Vegas fanatics.I guess what will dictate a lot is whether the 50% occupancy limit will extend to casinos or if the social distancing measures they put in place will have an impact - in saying that most people would just move onto another casino rather than queue."
"Mac's position here is totally valid. My entire job depends on having large events, limited social distancing and food service returning to normal. The quicker things open and return to a degree of normalcy, the better chance my job will return in the fall (I'm furloughed for the summer). We can't be stuck in phase zero forever."
"Casinos are still a month away, and they will be open to the degree that volume allows. There will be a ""mini surge"" when they first open. But the long term prognosis for the next three years is horribly grim. It will be at least a year before all properties are open, assuming they all do. No one is going to find the Vegas they left when they get back."
Everybody knows the anti-mask thing comes from fear of being called a pansy.
Round of Coronas on me at casino Royale when the borders open. Oh wait I think a wall starts on ours when Mexico is done.
What our politicians have done to our country and economy is absolutely disgusting and unimaginable.
"""..own stocks in MGM, Caesar’s..""And you don't know that it's ""Caesars"" without an apostrophe."
"""The quicker things open and return to a degree of normalcy, the better chance my job will return in the fall""But what many people don't realize is the quicker things open and return to a degree of normalcy, the more likely you'll be screwed in the near term.Vegas didn't get hit hard. That doesn't mean everyone there is immune. It means, the region is still susceptible. Same with most of California. Vegas or LA could be in the same boat as NYC by July if people are as stupid as I assume they are."
"Austin J you are assuming that when opening the casinos those that refuse to follow social distancing and wear suggested masks will not cause a huge spike in infections, and you absolutely do not know that. Other places that have started to open have had those increases.You may find that shortly after they are opened they will find that this will not work and the casinos will be completely shut down until a vaccine is found. Might want to get your resume ready just in case."
lin-duh so how would you have handled this problem differently ?
"""What our politicians have done to our country and economy is absolutely disgusting and unimaginable""Guessing with that statement you think nothing should have been done? Guessing how you think most of the world was and is still wrong for all their measures they put in place? What do YOU think the outcome would have been if nothing was done? Economy wouldn't have changed? Been better? 10,000 meat processing workers would not have been infected? Just for a moment try to think outside of your box and try to see how much worse it would have been if NOTHING was done. Scary."
They have three casinos I’d say are the size of Casino Royals. Silverton and Franklin are the others.
"“ Oh wait I think a wall starts on ours when Mexico is done.” - ha, I know you’re joking, but if you lived here, you’d know the Wall really is needed. I could take you to a couple American ranches on the border and all of you that are against the Wall would change your tune after finding out what those poor families have had to go through over the generations. 13"
"""What our politicians have done to our country and economy is absolutely disgusting and unimaginable""Did the politicians do this or did Covid 19 do this to the economy?"
"Old and sick people should have stayed home, the government should have made sure hospitals and research had ample funding, and the rest of us should have continued with our happy little lives."
"Ha, they always bring up problems or issues, but never solutions. What section of society does that resemble?13"
"""Old and sick people should have stayed home, the government should have made sure hospitals and research had ample funding, and the rest of us should have continued with our happy little lives.""Maybe if nothing was put in place you wouldn't have a happy little life to continue.Also funding has never been an issue. PPE yes though. Funding wouldn't really have changed anything.Edited: 9:19 am, May 12, 2020 "
Everyone overreacted. Covid just isn't as deadly as they thought/said it would be.
"Too many listen to the pundits, commentators, and experts that each/all media and social outlets present to feed fear and animus. They all seem to know better than the team in charge. I am not sorry that I feel we should trust our government to do it's best for us. Leaving it to Governors and Mayors may not be the wisest. Only time will tell. Not enough time to pass judgement on any action to date. I fear, and I know some would disagree, that there is some hope out there for the current administration failure for self-serving agenda. And, that is sad and un-American."
I didn’t realize not being allowed to work and provide for your family was just an inconvenience
"I mean...by y'alls estimation, the people who work at gas stations and grocery stores and Lowes should all be dead by now, right? I mean, they come in contact with hundreds of people a day. But I still see the same smiling faces every day at Lowes and Murphy's and Piggly Wiggly and the feed store.And why is that? Because this whole thing has been blown way out of proportion.And whatever good intentions might have originally been in place are now overshadowed by politics."
"lin-duh, you are ignorant and misinformed. But don't worry, our dumbed down society has made that acceptable. So you just keep banging that drum. Your stupidity blends in with the masses."
"No intelligent response, just insults. Typical."
"The Ohio Health Director stated yesterday that they have found at least 5 individuals in 5 different counties that had Coronavirus in January 2020. No one knew at the time, all businesses ran as normal until late March. The hospitals were not overrun."
That’s what Coronabros do. I think they have low self esteem and are not happy with the way their life has turned out. So they want everyone unhappy
"It's hard to offer up an intelligent response, to an utterly ignorant statement.Besides, I learned a long time ago: It's hard to win an argument with a smart person. But it's impossible to win one with a stupid person. I don't waste my time on the impossible.I'm on the front lines of this every day. While dealing with it and seeing people die, I've simultaneously lost a years worth of earnings trying to maintain my practice and pay my employees while running at less than 10% of our usual volume. I have neither the energy nor the inclination to explain to someone like you the fault in your position, when you are just going to continue to embrace the wrong information your favorite talking heads continue to pepper you with."
"lin-duh, perhaps in your small town it may appear as being ""blown out of proportion"", but I'd hardly call almost 82,000 deaths and counting in your country as being blown out of proportion."
"Trek, I'm sorry I must have missed it. Where and when did you say you received your degrees in infectious disease and epidemiology?"
"You had time to type all that, but no time to explain why my stupid self is all wrong. LolTalking heads, fox news...people need to get new lines, really."
MGG42 you have lost a years worth of earnings in 2 months? I don’t believe you
"Lin duh...many of current deaths are those in nursing homes..and most , if not all, are locked down by just being in a nursing home..The virus wasn’t something they could prevent, they didn’t go to the store, they stay 100% of time in the nursing home..The virus came to them...most likely via asymptomatic employees..."
Lin-duh:Getting back to your original post... I think casinos will be busier than many think at least initially. A significant portion of the population has not been impacted financially or physically and has saved considerable $. Add to that pent up desire for some small sense of normalcy and you have lots of folks wanting to go domestically. Much depends on how this return is marketed by the casinos plus social media reports in my view. I expect the media will seek out any new cases and they will be called an outbreak followed by “experts” and “officials” that are “fearful” of what may happen. One of our best premiers (governors) in Canada while opening his province (state) slowly said that we should expect a slight rise but had to weigh that risk against economic disaster (I’m paraphrasing). We shall see.
"""MGG42 you have lost a years worth of earnings in 2 months? I don’t believe you""I own a medical practice and employ 23 people counting staff, nurses and providers. I have maintained my payroll, benefits, and carried the same expenses while generating less than 10% of the revenue. Those costs add up to more than I took home in 2019. Believe it now?"
"lin-duh thinks that the death rate is so low that we should just let everything run as always and be willing to accept the collateral damage. I think now I understand the ""duh"" part of her name...."
"Be region specific, it’s a huge country, NY is not CA nor TX or NV. 1/3 of American counties have no c19 case. Have you seen the movie “Escape from New York” with Kurt Russell? New York messed this up big time, I totally agree with EasT Coast friends, it should be in lock down strict quarantine for 1-2 years. Zombie land lock down where no one is allowed to leave, period. But Nevada is opposite of everything New York. Busy has different definitions in casinos. Busy as in Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday morning or Saturday night?"
A couple weeks ago I heard a healthcare worker being interviwed on TV say that you cannot fully appreciate the threat of this virus until you see someone you love gasping for breath. Made an impression on me and I always think of that when I hear people pooh-poohing this pandemic.
I believe they will be.
"“ Have you seen the movie “Escape from New York” with Kurt Russell? New York messed this up big time, I totally agree with EasT Coast friends, it should be in lock down strict quarantine for 1-2 years. Zombie land lock down where no one is allowed to leave, period.”So you want New York City to look like San Francisco?https:/…"
No. Why didn’t you get a PPE loan
Tdawg this thread kind of blew up but I believe it as there are far more densely populated areas along that border. I wouldn’t want property along that line.
Dr Fauci & friends are about to brief Senators. Might be good to listen & learn. Your favorite national tv news media and CSPAN3 are showing now.
"As a nation, our economic salvation is reopening. No money no medicines no school no food no nothing. New York needs rest of the country to reopen to save it, or else what follows C19 is greatest depression. They need us to reopen to save New York. I’d think those want total lock down to continue are eager to see reopening, so that they can say: I told you so! Use the other 49 states to test the water. Bet you many people are hoping Trump gets it soon."
"Qdogpa - most of the deaths were in nursing homes. What is the average age of people living in nursing homes? How many people die in nursing homes in a 3 month span during normal times? Don't get me wrong, I love grandmas. But if most of the deaths are of the 80+ crowd, people who are already bad off enough that they live in a nursing home, does that really justify causing everyone else to lose everything?Mgg - doctors and nurses are being laid off and losing tons of money...during a health crisis...doesnt that seem odd to you?Pb- oh man, a play on my screen name. So clever. Never saw that before. Omg. Feelings=hurt"
I don't think there will be a single thing in this briefing that has not been communicated endlessly over the last couple of months. Will be a typical congressional hearing Charley Foxtrot with dems making speeches to score points and take free shots at Trump. Will be a total waste of time.
"""No. Why didn’t you get a PPE loan"" I did, but it doesn't come close to the losses due to loss of revenue. And it only covers a portion of the expenses."
"Also...I love how everyone is living by expert advice nowadays. No one listened about driving the speed limit, limiting alcohol consumption, abstaining from smoking, getting 8 hours of sleep every night, avoiding screen time before bed, getting plenty of exercise, eating a healthy diet..."
"It pays for your employees payroll. So if you really have a medical practice, which I don’t think you do, you would not be down 12 months of net income in 2 months."
"It's not as simple as you make it sound Trek. It's a high volume, high revenue business, but the margin is exceptionally tight for an independent practice.And you don't have to believe me. I've been here for close to 15 years, and know a great deal of people here personally. If I was lying, I'd be called out on it by people who have been here longer than you have."
"PB, sadly you are correct. It has already turned to the blame game being laid out by Sen. Patty Murray; pure partisan. skip it."
It’s also hard to listen to tucker Carlson he just asks himself stupid questions.
"Birddog wasn't that amazing ?!!!It took her about 15 seconds in her first 5 minutes to start taking shots at Trump. So sad and pathetic.Edited: 10:34 am, May 12, 2020 "
"CanadianOil yes I agree all of the democrats think he asks stupid questions. But just wait, they are going to get more stupid to democrats in the future as the Obamagate investigation proceeds."
"CO, Tucker Carlson is indeed an conspiracy theorist alarmist as are so many others of main stream. However, he is not an elected Senator and is not participating in our US Senate briefing. Thus, whatever point you tried to make is not relative and rather ignorant."
"Trump takes shots at everyone with an opinion different than his. Trump walked away from his briefing yesterday. There's an important Supreme Court case today.Edited: 10:49 am, May 12, 2020 "
DTC yes he does and he constantly makes himself look like on idiot. But he is still better than our other choice last time and even more so with the democrat half-wit they are putting up this time.

So if you really have a medical practice, which I don’t think you do, you would not be down 12 months of net income in 2 months.""""I'm guessing you don't understand the expenses involved with operating a business....payroll is just one piece. And if there is no income coming in for 2-3 months, you can quickly eat up your profits for a year in many types of businesses"
lin-duh....I could see the casinos that re-open first being quite busy with demand from those in reasonable driving distance of Las Vegas.
"""most of the deaths were in nursing homes."" Fake news and made up. Facts are facts. Hord for some to accept. From the NY TimesOne-Third of All U.S.Coronavirus Deaths Are NursingHome Residents or Workershttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/…"
"Trek, there’s a time when you realize you’re out of your league in a discussion. Now is your time."
"""""@69 - PB - if you think Biden is a half wit, then he’s at least 2x better than the current liar that hates science and facts.""""Three years, and Biden is the best to offer.... I can see the bumper stickers now..... ""Biden, he's bad, but not as bad as Trump"""
"2saltydogs well I don't know how you derive at that, and I don't even want to try to dispute it.However if you don't think the basic outlook and direction of the democratic party is a total disaster for this country, then it really doesn't matter much. 95% of what Trump has done is absolutely the right direction for this country and he has almost been able to undo all the bad policy and changes made by the prior administration."
PB...many people seem angry that the precautions are too restrictive but that's what the experts wanted...better safe than sorry allowing for adjustments to be made as necessary.
nuzz OK thank you for that clarification and now I understand. I guess I fail to see how they could have been much less restrictive. But let's hope it works.
"Well, without details it's not possible to discuss on here. And it's not even close to being on topic."
"Don’t think so, Coronabro"
The Center for Responsive Politics has tracked payments to Trump properties. Trump's profiteering during his term as President shows what he cares about first.
"Yes, we should get back on topic. People are dug in with their opinions. Nothing changes with any discussion."
"lin-duhI do not doubt that you care for your fellow human beings. But it wouldn't be a bad thing to research why deaths caused by accidents, smoking, drinking, sky diving, cancer, etc should not even be compared with reaction to prevent covid infections and deaths. The former are either unavoidable (accidents), by choice (partying, extreme sports), or genetic (cancer). What those things have in common is that they are not contagious, and people practicing them cannot transfer tragic results to anyone else (except drunk drivers and insensitive smokers). And there are DUI and smoking laws in effect for the public's safety.Covid is infectious, and unlike the flu that has visible symptoms to warn healthy people to stay away, carriers can seem fine but are actually highly infectious. It's like having a zombie apocalypse, except you won't know who to stay away from because the zombies are neither threatening you nor out to get you. They could be that friendly person talking to you in a bar or grocery store, innocently spraying microscopic droplets around them as they talk without a mask."
"Since there is really nothing to discuss concerning Las Vegas, just speculation. might just as well let er rip.Just hope that when things get back to normal that this forum returns to being a useful place to get information when planning a trip to Vegas."
vpear... One can only hope.
I will start a favorite Vegas topic for vpearlKC and HardTen.
"LV properties would do well to price at the low end to drive traffic and then slowly raise rates as flying activity begins to rise. 20% of LV visitors are Californians making the drive. Make it worth their while to stay at WLV, Aria, Venetian, etcI don’t believe the shutdowns were an over-reaction. But I don’t like that “flattening the curve” so as not to overwhelm our hospitals has now become “let’s make sure nobody gets sick anymore”. The former has been accomplished – the latter is impossible. I saw no hospitals report not being able to serve patients for lack of beds, respirators, etc. They were super busy, yes. But not overwhelmed. In Chicago where I live, we built a huge temporary hospital at McCormick place and used about 10% of the capacity. I have no problem taking those precautionary steps. But now that the worst has been avoided, things need to open back up.The problem is that the decision is in the hands of politicians where the political risk of opening too soon and being wrong is much greater than just sitting back and being extra safe. Meanwhile, the longer the economy remains stagnant, the longer it will take to recover."
"I'm sure they will be busy. I'm sure all of this speculation will go out the window once they reopen. I doubt if they will really keep everything like bars and cocktails service closed. It sounds good on paper, not so much in practice. I can understand clubs and pool parties staying closed for awhile, although I hope clubs do reopen eventually soon."
"dw732: good post. Last paragraph sums it up nicely. Trying again to get back to Lin-din’s question:I really do think folks will come. A lot of folks., If I were a casino operator - I can’t change what the circumstances are but I can have an aggressive game plan for long term strength. That’s the challenge- and it’s exciting in a way with the right mindset.BTW watching the snow fly outside for the 5th straight day in mid-May I’m reminded of one of the draws of LV for us: sunny hot weather."
vpear.... it was used for that purpose occasionally pre-Covaid.
"It is correct, for elected officials, everything is a political calculation. For the casinos, it is all business. If the Nevada Governor was replaced with South Dakota's for instance, and there was enough business for them, the casinos would have never closed. All these policies aren't about your safety, it is about the bottom line. An illusion of safety and a way to protect them from litigation if someone gets sick."
"A law will be passed soon that will indemnify any entity or person from being sued because someone got the Chinese flu and died.Edited: 1:41 pm, May 12, 2020 "
"@PnS, you said ""For the casinos, it is all business. If the Nevada Governor was replaced with South Dakota's for instance, and there was enough business for them, the casinos would have never closed.""That may be true, but the critical difference is the ""if there was enough business"", and that will be the critical problem for Vegas going forward. Unlike regional casinos, Vegas lives and dies, heck Vegas now exists because of business; meetings, conventions, trade shows. That whole industry is screwed. Business travel is going to be decimated. Companies are only going to pursue that when it's absolutely necessary. And I hate to break it to you, but maybe 10% of the goings on are absolutely necessary. Sure, trade shows allow for in-person product demonstrations, so they will continue, but I suspect they will be downsized, and maybe even regionalized. The days of CES boasting about bigger and bigger crowds every year are gone. Vegas was built to what it is today not because of people like those of us here who love the city. It wasn't built by and for the gamblers. It was built for the meeting/ conference/ tradeshow business. There aren't anywhere near enough leisure travelers to even come close to filling the room inventory, not to mention stores, restaurants and other diversions.I suspect three years from now at least 25% of The Strip will still be closed."
"@placebets, seeing as there is no such thing as the ""chinese flu"" I don't think it's unreasonable to offer such indemnity!"
"Placebets in regards to your message talker about people with land on the border feeling like they need a wall, that is incorrect. I live in south Texas and own land on the border, with how the government is trying to take our land or pay pennies on the dollar for access. I rather have illegal aliens passing through rather than give my property away. I am a Texan, I don’t like being screwed over by the government."
"I mentioned in the Laughlin forum how I believe it is in a much better position to recover quickly for just that reason. Lower rates, smaller properties, less overhead, cheaper dining and gambling. Couple that with the fact that most of their guests are locals or are at least from within the US and you have a winning combo. Plus, most people in the Laughlin/Bullhead and surrounding regions are conservative, and conservatives are much more likely to want to get outside and do stuff. Same was true for Deadwood. Still, I think Vegas will be back. I see all of the Strip hotels open within several months at the latest. Off Strip is a different story. Palms, Virgin, Rio for instance will take longer."
"keeburna can you show me where I said ""people with land on the border feeling like they need a wall""I guess I don't recall that, please post a link for me so maybe I can see the context and respond to your comment."

"I wonder if the model they're referring to is the one the White House cites from the University of Washington. Models offer a range of possibilities on a scale of 1% to 100% with 50% being the ""most likely"" scenario. So a 1% result on a day would be the best possible scenario with the fewest deaths and 100% being the worst case extreme result with the most. I say this because based on that particular model there has not been even a single day since this started where the actual result has been under 75%. In fact the vast majority of results have been in the 90%+ range.Edit: Thank you Joanner for the answer!Edited: 8:51 pm, May 12, 2020 "

"mgg42 I guess I don't see the big deal about that but I'll try.-DUH, you obviously don't have a clue what modeling is about do you ?"
cheap_chump. Well said. But it is hard not to respond when someone does not agree with me. And being male and older I feel life experiences makes me an expert . lol
"Yes, well said Cheap-Chump...thank you for that!"
"@placebets, it's just a pet peeve of mine. I hear people use ""flu"" all the time. ""I had the flu this weekend"". No, I'm sorry, you don't get the flu for a weekend. You had a cold. Put on your big boy pants and move on. Or, my personal favorite, ""I had the stomach flu""! What? influenza virus causes a respiratory illness. It doesn't give you the runs.Like I said, it's just my pet peeve. But when you live in the medical world it strikes you as funny. And no, it's DEFINITELY NOT a big deal!

"When LV reopens, then maybe there can be some relevant topics and discussions..cheap chump needs to relax a tad.... until then discussions about possible reopening etc are fodder for political discourse"
"i'm there jun 20-24th. hoping it's not so busy i won't be able to get a seat to play bartop vp, assuming the places i like will have it. the bars i like to play at are usually pretty busy, and if they only allow 1/2 occupancy, it could get competitive, lol."
"Yes, competitive in terms of getting a seat...and that's why we've changed our minds about coming back, for a while or forever. We like to sit side by side at tables, machines, VP bars...we talk to each other, take turns watching each other's hands, cheering each other...if I'm 6 feet away, and we can't interact, sorry, not worth it.Every time we go to Vegas we fantasize ""this time"" is when we're going to ""get them"", make up for the 40+ years of losses. I'm actually ok now with that that's NEVER going to happen. Cutting our losses and moving on. Lots of other places to vacation in this world. Or, if we have to stay home for a year (which it looks very likely)...that's fine, too, I love my house, my neighborhood, my town, my state."
"@espnawards, I think your hopes for late June are astonishingly optimistic. I suspect a maximum of 6 properties will be open, with maybe 1/3 to 1/2 the amenities (restaurants, etc...) operating. I don't know you you'll see any casino bars, and especially no video poker bars open at that time. And if they are, and it's half capacity, seating won't be ""competitive"", you'll likely be seated by a hostess."
"I've more or less thrown in the towel on a potential 2020 trip. Maybe early next year. Who knows. I am very confident Vegas will be open, but if I can't relax and enjoy the environment as I've come to expect it, then I'll impatiently wait until flying crosscountry is worth it again."
"Don’t understand why anyone would go to a 30% LV experience...only reason could be lack of access to gambling, and perhaps can drive in...like comparing a local carnival to Disneyworld"
"Qdogpa: I think it depends on how arduous to get there. If it's an easy trip from LA or Phoenix, 30% might be worth it just to have an escape. But flying all the way from the East Coast is not very appealing. I think I would find it surreal and depressing.My hope is that things calm down/better treatment/vaccine and at least can hit Mohegan or Foxwoods later this year. We'll have to see."
"Lin-duh - we almost drove from Lakeville MN to Deadwood this past weekend, but then decided against it"

"This has been a very interesting post for sure. As much as we may argue about different things,Im sure that if we all got together,we'd be cordial and enjoy the Vegas conversation with each other. Now,about you pussies------------------------------------lol"
"look at wisconsinsomebody earlier said something about why go to vegas at 30% or something like that. nope. when i go (hopefully) in late june, nothing will really be different about the experience i go for. i go to drink and gamble. pools are gross. i don't go to shop. not into spending a bunch on food. wasn't planning on going to any shows over my next couple of trips other than seeing bill burr at cosmo, and it looks like that may actually still be happening. the big difference will be that it will be a lot less crowded, and i'll be wearing a mask quite a bit."

If that's all I was interested in, I'd be at a local casino, not Vegas."
Not a chance...too much fear out there
"Drink and gamble, as MGG said, why bother..unless you can drive there in under an hour. Vegas at 30% is a waste of time for most of LV visitors..."
"WW...you bring up an interesting concept re social distancing.What happens when a couple comes into a Vegas casino,hotel or restaurant etc, will they have to stay 6' apart sitting at a bar,table games,in a pool etc.?Edited: 8:51 am, May 15, 2020 "
#139....do you go to AC on a regular basis ?
"I will go to AC long before I venture back to LV... as I have said, and others as well, 30% LV experience is not worth it for most visitors...should be ok for those who can drive in,Edited: 9:18 am, May 15, 2020 "
At least the NJ beaches are opening. Back in the family days went to the Crest every summer. Might take a solo trip this summer to AC.
I agree with qdog. If you can drive a short distance I would go to Lv but to get on a plane and spend the time and money to go with these restrictions like Mgm is rolling out it will feel like it’s empty. Kind of like the week before Christmas.
Family members and people living together are exempted from social distance rules.
"One of our local Indian casinos just opened up. They are the first in our State. The conditions are similar to what Vegas will implement. The road leading into the Casino was backed up for 4 miles. Waiting time to get in was over 3 hours or not at all. They are taking half the amount of folks as before. 12,000 divided by 2."
This might be a plus side to having a high level players card. I'd wager MGM would want to let in Noir/Platinum players before your average guests. I mean they do it for most everything else.

I watched a video of the Harrah’s Ak Chin opening and the line was really long outside. It looks like folks all over are ready to get out and gamble.
I wanted to be there so bad. I did everything I could to convince my wife to take the day off and to go. Would have been so fun to be the first in line. Alas at home.

"Hotel guests have priorities, they live in the casinos. High roller members don’t wait in lines, that was always the SOP. If you have been there on quiet weekdays or 2AM, you know casinos are not always busy all hours."
Those same people sitting in line for 3 hours to get into a casino will be whining about sitting in line at a food bank tomorrow.
