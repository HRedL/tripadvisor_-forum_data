"The 1980 Olympics was not cancelled. It was boycotted by several nations, but it still went ahead. The 1976 and 1984 games also experienced boycotts.Edited: 6:14 pm, May 02, 2020 "
"Summer Olympic Games were canceled in 1916 (Berlin) and 1940 (Tokyo). Winter games were canceled in 1940 (Sapporo) and 1944 (Cortina d'Ampezzo). Under the current situation around the world, my guess is Tokyo will be canceled in 2021, and Beijing 2022 can be boycotted."

"I can't believe what I'm reading. Olympics cancelled in 2021? Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine. Why does everyone want a vaccine? Because you listen to Bill Gates, Dr Fauci and the New York Times. You are being deceived. With the vaccine comes your digital tattoo and mark of the beast Microsoft biometrics. All you need is HydroxychloroQUINE - quinine. On March 10 1945, 90000-100000 people died in the bombing of Tokyo. Next day they were out cleaning up and getting on with life. 517 have died in Japan and you are so fearful...."
"As far as I read here opinions by the experts, including executive members of Japan Medical Association, most people are not that optimistic about the implementation of the virus vaccine in spring 2021. The fastest simulation is currently in late summer till early autumn. Very fast implementation may include side effect. When the organizing committee chair said there would be no second postpone, everyone here understands it will be implied to be a cancel."
"Should COVID-19 be a reason to stop travel around the world and cancel Olympic games, when influenza does not stop people traveling or cancel events?"
Too early to talk about cancellation of Olympics.We are trying to gain time for getting effective mediciation and avoid the spread by people staying at home.
">>> Should COVID-19 be a reason to stop travel around the world and cancel Olympic games, when influenza does not stop people traveling or cancel events?What surprisingly ignorant statement. The ramifications of the common flu are nothing like COVID-19."
"""Should COVID-19 be a reason to stop travel around the world and cancel Olympic games, when influenza does not stop people traveling or cancel events?""The death totals indicate yes."
"gosto and jordansbullsWe are starting to see information coming to light that the CDC in the US is revising its figures down from 66000 COVID deaths to now 37,000.We are starting to see that the National Institute of Health in Italy says 96.3% died NOT of COVID-19 but of other pathologies. That means only 925 have died of the virus. 24,075 have died of other things.These are not my numbers. How much more will come to light?The roll out of 5G technology will also lead to more sickness which will be blamed on COVID."
"I think I wrote before but could you give a link of your sources, Aussie_bushman?"
">>> We are starting to see information coming to light that the CDC in the US is revising its figures down from 66000 COVID deaths to now 37,000.Now you are just flat out making up numbers or getting them from some fringe alt-right site. Even the Grifter in Chief has revised his latest estimate to 100000 max by August. And there are over 71,000 deaths from COVID 19 so far, and possibly 10's of thousands more deaths that haven't been counted because there was a shortage of tests when they died.>>> The roll out of 5G technology will also lead to more sickness which will be blamed on COVID.It has been scientifically proven that wearing a tin foil hat will protect you from electromagnetic waves and alien thought control."

"Pfizer is starting trials on a vaccine. https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-liv…Avigan and Remdesivir will mostly likely be approved this week. https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Pharmaceuti…Of course, they're not fool proof. https:/…japan-avigan-coronavirus.htmlFor now, just stay home. And help to flatten the curve. BTW, some EU countries are not letting people back in, even if they have a residency card. The passengers have to PROVE their residency with a utility bill or something. A round trip ticket saying they left that country before all this mess started isn't enough. Nor is a bank account in that country. Or a marriage certificate with a citizen of that country (who is living there). Seriously, I can't imagine the world suddenly waking up to ""back to the way we were"" within a year."
