"My daughter cancelled her large WI wedding due to COVID in September. We are thinking of renting a home near West Yellowstone and just having a small ceremony outdoors. Maybe 15 people. They got engaged in Yosemite National Park, and they love mountains. Looking at Friday, September 25th. I’m looking for suggestions for the ceremony & lodging (we hope to be there from 9/20-9/26). We don’t want a hotel or anything that could end up closing - we already paid for a reception back home, so we are not looking to do that either (will most likely have a reception/dance back home next year if the virus gets under control)."
Do you know it could be cold the end of September? Possible snow?

"Why are you considering West Yellowstone?Covid-19 cases are increasing dramatically in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut just passed mandatory 14-Day Self-Quarantines for anyone returning from travel to states with high Covid-19 Positivity Rates. Idaho is currently on that list. West Yellowstone is just 10 miles from Idaho. I honestly don't think it's going to get much better anytime soon. : (Isn't there an outdoors area in your own town where you can have a small, family only wedding? And have a dance/reception later like you're planning on doing? In this time of uncertainty, I would think that would be less stressful.DebEdited: 7:54 pm, July 06, 2020 "
