"Extended runway, more boarding gates, renovated Immigration area are much more await tourists when they return to Nepal @ https:/…Edited: 5:25 am, May 28, 2020 "
I hope the renovated airport is not boring like most other airports and retains some Nepalese character!!!!
The single runway will remain a limitation forever.
"Pierre, the new airport in Pokhara might be the big change Nepal needs going forward. It will be interesting to see how it's used."

What about the one near Lumbini that's supposed to be upgraded to an international airport?
"@5, That airport is coming along very slowly. It will primarily see international service to Indian airports to facilitate tourism in the monsoon months as Indians escape the heat on their way to Pokhara, Bandipur, etc."
"Ah, I see. When I was there in January, it looked sooo close to being finished. It has been a seemingly never ending project! And, of course, the pandemic has surely extended the finish date. Maybe next year? Coming from the states, hoping it will be an option to get to Nepal (sounds like via a connection from Delhi)."
We also have the Nijgadh Airport project.https://www.google.com/search?q=Nijgadh+airporthttps:/…
