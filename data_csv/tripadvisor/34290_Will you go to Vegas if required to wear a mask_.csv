Wondering what everyone's thoughts are. Do you think a lot of people will cancel their trips?
"if people cancel trips because of masks they're morons. There's a reason the EU is banning travel from the USA. it's a tough pill to swallow but we spit the bit on reducing the curve. (I've worked 10 weeks consecutively since the outbreak. I'm spending five nights in vegas end of month. im bringing masks, hand sanitizer, wipes and gloves. I haven't had so much as a sniffle, but I've only missed one workday past this century. im more than a tad concerned I could carry the bug and drop it to someone higher risk, i'll gladly do my part to try to keep everyone as safe as possible) that said, I cant wait to smoke and drink mask-free next year. Cheers!"
I am going to Vegas in August and will wear a mask if required. If not required I will not. I'll have to modify my mask to be able to poke a straw through it though.
"There wasn't a chance in hell we were going, when masks were not required. Now we might.."
Won't go if masks are NOT required especially to Vegas where there are people from everywhere. I value life too much to take a chance on losing it.
"It's a net win.For a few of the goofballs, it will eventually sink in that this gets them off the hook about looking like a sissy. So they'll still go.The rest are poring over their maps planning their underground railroad routes to South Dakota and freedom."
"Funny, when did following the crowd become cool? I'll enjoy South Dakota as long as they let me walk around the casino drinking from a bottle of L'Essence de Courvoisier and of course mask free the entire time. Enjoy Caesars Hospital and Casino. Hey I might get to see snow this year, just realized that. Double win."
Swearingin. I think you meant knuckleheads instead of goofballs.
I identify as an eccentric. Goofball isn't bad either.
Oh swearingen you gotta come for me about my state?! Burn!
"Lol, nothing wrong with the scenery, I've been there.Invite pns over, he can demonstrate how to walk down the hall with a pimp cup making it rain for all the little people in Vegas."
"Even Texas is about to require masks. So it doesn't matter where you are, Vegas or not, you're soon gonna have to wear a mask if you want to keep your state ""open"". Of course, we could always just shut down the country for another 3 or 4 months if you prefer."
The only woman I'm pimpin' is sweet Lady Liberty! And I'm tricking her out all over this town.
"I very much doubt Gov. Abbot would mandate masks. That would be electoral suicide. South Dakota is firmly in the cause of freedom. You can try to kill freedom, but it will always find a way to survive. Gov. Noem is amazing. I'd love to see her as the first female President. She is everything that this nation needs."
"Mask or No Mask, I am still going to Vegas. It will not shut down again."
"How many times do we need to ask the exact same question repeatedly by different people? YES, Which part of YES you do not understand? Y? E? or S?"
"“ Gov. Noem is amazing. ”Yeah. Sounds like it. She should do well in DC.“ Governor's mansion fence Noem proposed to build a fence around the governor's mansion for approximately $400,000. The proposal was not well-received and she eventually retracted it.[91] [92]Hiring family members Noem hired her daughter, Kennedy, while still in college and then raised her annual salary from $40,000 to $60,000 in the first year. Noem's administration also hired her son-in-law Kyle Peters for about $60,000 per year.[93][94]Television studio in the Capitol Noem authorized having her own television studio in the Capitol for $130,000 per year so she could appear on television nationally.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem"
Some people fall for and admire grifters and conmen. Beats me why.
"Irish,And this is different than politicians like Biden, Clinton, etc. She at least votes the way I want."
A governor votes for what? Herself? American Idol?
Sorry I mean governs the way I want. Too much typing today.
"PnS, your comments have become downright desperate dude."
"Desperation is what I see from your side of the argument. People were enjoying themselves too much. Can't have that. I'm good. Did what I needed to do last weekend. I feel worse for the casino workers who will suffer because of this. There is always an option available, if one doesn't exist, create one."
"""Desperation is what I see from your side of the argument. ""Actually yeah. It's true. One does get desperate watching 3 months of being locked down being utterly wasted by selfishness and stupidity. And don't think for a second that a single person here think you give a rat's a*s about the casino workers."
I have friends that work in them. Try again.
"This is actually better, I feel safer going now."
"Is $60,000 a terribly high salary for someone who works for the governor? I wouldn't think so."
"@PNS re:""...walk around the casino drinking from a bottle of L'Essence de Courvoisier...""Would you really even know what this was, if you hadn't read about it on some pretentious 'faux rich' millennial webpage or overpriced restaurant drink menu?...

Don't need to go that bad. Can wait.
"If I can get a refund on my airfare and hotel, I plan on cancelling my visit on July 6-10. I plan on wearing a mask, but I don't like be forced to wear one 100% of the time. I guess one way around it is to have a beer in my hand 24/7 to satisfy the exemption of not having to wear a mask/face covering when eating or drinking."

@WilliamB--absinthe is widely available. Sage even has an absinthe cart. Downtown Cocktail Room has a lovely absinthe service. Look for the guy in a long dark trench coat on Fremont Street. He's got loads of kinder eggs. You just have to use the password.
"The mask requirement makes me feel more comfortable about coming. We have reservations in September, staying 3 nights at the Aria and 3 nights at the Palazzo. I have been thinking about cancelling if people are not required to wear masks inside the casinos. I understand that they may not be comfortable outside in the heat, but it is not hot in the casinos. I prefer to err on the side of safety."
"Hello FLWfan1867, ""...the best thing you can do to protect employees is to wear a mask.""It may be the ""best"" thing, but not the ""only"" thing you can do."
A sobering thought: The CDC said that the number of US coronavirus cases is likely 10 times what has been reported.
"@DownTownCruiser That's actually an encouraging statistic. If ten times as many people have been infected then the percentage of people for whom the infection case any serious illness is really a lot lower than what it seems.For anyone who has been to Fremont Street since the mask law went into effect, are people wearing masks there?"
Wow. What a testimonial. I don't like or dislike him. I'm horrified by the things he says.
"We just booked a charter trip to Harrah's Lake Tahoe for later in July then the next day the state mask mandate came. But in Lake Tahoe there are tons of outdoors things to see and do in the summer where the average high is only 78. So I am using this as sort of a test run for our October Vegas trip in case masks are still required then in Vegas. Here in Illinois, I am already used to wearing one for 45 mins to grocery shop, or a few minutes to pop into CVS. Can I indeed mentally handle hours in a mask? Am I ok if I have to walk outside (or to my room) every hour or so to smoke? What's it like walking outdoors in areas where I can't be 6 ft apart wearing a mask? That will help determine if we want to go to Vegas in masks in October. But when it's 100 degrees? Well, I don't like to be in that weather even without a mask; which is why we've only been to Vegas Oct - April. And as we can see from it just being 3 weeks since Vegas reopened. Things can change day to day. Everyone can determine for themselves, but I like that I'll have this test run; where if I don't like gambling with it at least I have the options of nature and a temperate climate. Hopefully those that do go now are sun lovers who can similarly find ""escapism"" at the pool.Edited: 3:52 pm, June 25, 2020 "
Already cancelled mine. Rule is stupid. Who wants to walk around in Vegas heat in the SUMMER in a mask? People have lost their minds. I will never do this.
"""I don't like or dislike him. I'm horrified by the things he says."" Well, without being facetious, I really think that is admirably ethical of you FLWfan1867 to have such a stance (only if by ""the things"" you mean ""some things"", and not ""everything"" you have read that he says)."
South Dakota allows smoking in public places like restaurants and in the workplace? I highly doubt it. What's different about this? Nobody has the right to tread on other peoples primary liberty which is the right to live. And hence why masks are going to be mandatory in a lot of places for the next year.
Nothing would be finer than if everyone who refuses to mask-up also refuses to visit Las Vegas. Might keep the city open a few more weeks.
"You can like a person and not agree with them. I have close friends who are much more to the left than me and much more to the right. I don't know what Andrew's political opinions are for instance, nor frankly would it matter to me. He might disagree with me on masking, so what? You should ideally surround yourself with people who each bring something to the table and have differing opinions. That doesn't mean you don't share interests or core values, but we lose something when everyone in a group is a carbon copy of each other. I can appreciate his stance on something and respect it, even if I think he is wrong, hopefully he can respect mine in return. The same goes for anyone here. Tolerance doesn't mean agreeing with, it means putting up with. When you conflate the issue and the person that is when things become bad. I posted one of the ""Rules for Radicals"" by Saul Alinsky on another thread. These days people tend to follow these ""rules"" subconsciously. It isn't making us better. End of the day, I doubt anyone is going to change their opinions here, doesn't mean we can't debate things. But calling people stupid or what have you just makes things worse for all of us. I don't hate anyone here also. What I don't like is venom being spit at another. Want me to actually listen and consider something with an open mind? Don't insult/threaten/intimidate me and don't make me think I'm supporting the team. Lay things out in a rational fashion, if I agree, I agree, if I don't, I don't. That's all."

Pns is just fine. Its just a shame that some here give him such a beating because he doesnt think the way they do. There are always two sides to every story. And sometimes its the other side that ends up on the right side.
I have a trip to Vegas planned late July. I will cancel my trip if I am required to wear a mask. If you're at high risk or are very nervous about Covid why are you going anyway?
"""There are always two sides to every story.""There are not two stories to science. He gets lambasted here because he's the most prominent promoter of dangerous views about the pandemic. (The pandemic which he said wasn't one until a couple of days ago.)"
"""I have a trip to Vegas planned late July. I will cancel my trip if I am required to wear a mask""Thank you for canceling your trip. There are a whole lot of people, who don't even know you, that wouldn't want to be in the same room with you."
"Isn't the rule, you only wear the mask indoors?"
"""You should ideally surround yourself with people who each bring something to the table and have differing opinions.

That very much includes governments. EXCEPT there is a disparity here. It 's one thing for someone to say ""I don't believe wearing a mask is important. But I don't mind being around others who wear them."" But you won't find anyone saying ""I think wearing a mask is important, but I don't mind being around others who don't."" It is important to them. It isn't the FEELING that they are not as safe as if everyone wore masks. It is the KNOWLEDGE that they are not as safe. If only ONE person who is infected does not wear a mask, they are not as safe.Hence all of the regulations favoring one side of the issue. And if they are not taken seriously, they will just get worse.Again, I am not a genius. Any intelligent person can see what is happening."
I am coming in two weeks and will gladly wear a mask if this keeps Vegas open and get's me there.
"@KTKnowledge whether it is correct or incorrect, can cause one to have certain feelings, comfort, stress, sadness, joy, etc. A person might feel they have a great system on how to win at roulette, it will make them feel confident, happy, but in the end they are still wrong. From my perspective, I find masks in the general public to be disease spreaders vs protection based on the knowledge that I have. I cringe when I see people misuse them, which is often. Two doctors might have entirely different opinions on something, neither one is necessarily stupid or insert any other random insult thrown around here lately. The same can be said for politics, I know for a fact you are intelligent, as are many people on here who are left of center. You are absolutely wrong lol, but, you probably think the exact same thing about me. If you thought of me, ""how can someone so smart be so blind"", I wouldn't hold it against you, well that is if you think I'm intelligent in the first place I suppose. For a very short period when the government said masks don't work, at the beginning, I disagreed with them and thought that was stupid, until I actually looked at the science behind things. Science isn't my background, but I've always had an interest. I agreed with them then after that, it made sense, until of course they completely changed their minds. When I don't know something, I lean on my lovely and intelligent wife whose background is science. Her new assignment that she is prepping for is seeing how COVID-19 infected blood interacts with certain things. It could be beneficial for coming up with treatments. Can't go into details but suffice it to say she and her staff of several dozen people were chosen due to their competence, scientific and technical knowledge and will soon have the most hands on and intimate work with COVID of anyone here or closely connected to anyone here, not including Qdog's relative who I think is an ICU nurse. The point I'm trying to make, without beating a dead horse 1,000 times is, getting into freedom, politics, etc, I have a literally in-house expert on PPE, biology, and soon C-19. Someone who when not bogged down in paper work and conference calls will actually be working on the virus itself. I'm lucky for that.I'm very much a skeptic on anything, I research things to the point of exhaustion. That is one of the reasons why my knowledge of hotels is so vast. I weigh things out before coming to a conclusion. I did this was face masks, and others did as well, my beliefs are shared with many, just many stay silent. For the record, I have purchased a House of Bijan Face Shield which I'll use when I absolutely need to go into a place that won't look the other way. Unlike a mask it actually has a chance of protecting me and others, I can breathe in a face shield, it can be cleaned simply, and is snobby enough to please my sensibilities. At the end of the day, the point is now moot since Nevada is now a mandatory mask state. I'm not traveling to Nevada until the masks are optional again, nor anywhere where they are mandatory. I hold no ill will if someone does want to travel here, may their trip be enjoyable, for me it wouldn't be. I hope that finally this topic can be put to rest and we can just move on, until the mask order is finally lifted and then we can argue it again for a few weeks ad nauseam."

"I disagree vehemently with the opinion of PnS about the science of wearing masks. I have two children who are doctors,one an anesthesiologist in Dallas where the hospitals are now getting overrun with patients with covid and the other a third year pathology resident in Baltimore with an MDPhd.(her Phd in molecular biology). They both have told us in no uncertain terms to never go out without a mask. You could also check with CDC guidelines as to what is correct now. Early on they were trying to save ppe for healthcare.If nothing else you should wear a mask to help protect all of the healthcare workers and essential workers who care for us every day."
"South Dakota won't have one. The state never actually shut down in the first place. It also has almost no COVID cases and again, the Governor there rocks.

How do you trust someone when they admitted they lied to you? Even spun as ""for the medical professionals"" it shows the government's contempt for us, the average American. It also makes no sense since the CDC and WHO never recommended masks as useful respiratory illnesses as far as I can tell. This isn't a little white lie, either they lied to us then, or they are lying to us now. They've played with our lives, our wallets, and our freedom. I'll certainly consider anything the CDC or WHO reports and will study it, but I'll take anything they or the government in general says with a grain of salt. I don't care who is in power, Trump, Biden, Rand Paul, myself. I trust our Constitution not our government. Government isn't our friend and never will be. It is and should always be our subordinate, one that is carefully monitored."

Yesterday I went to a newly reopened Native American casino in upstate NY which required wearing a mask.Bottom line was that it turned out to be a mere inconvenience and would not deter me from future visits.

"From @libbyjones715Welcome to the Freedom Cafe! We trust you to make your own choices if you want to wear a face mask. And, in the same spirit of individual liberty, we allow our staff to make their own choices about the safety procedures they prefer to follow as they prepare and serve your food.We encourage employees to wash their hands after using the bathroom, but understand that some people may be allergic to certain soaps or may simply prefer not to wash their hands. It is not our place to tell them what to do.We understand that you may be used to chicken that has been cooked to 165 degrees. We do have to respect that some of our cooks may have seen a meme or a YouTube video saying that 100 degrees is sufficient, and we do not want to encroach on their beliefs.Some of our cooks may prefer to use the same utensils for multiple ingredients, including ingredients some customers are allergic to. That is a cook’s right to do so.Some servers may wish to touch your food as they serve it. There is no reason that a healthy person with clean hands can’t touch your food. We will take their word for it that they are healthy and clean.Water temperature and detergent are highly personal choices, and we allow our dishwashing team to decide how they’d prefer to wash the silverware you will put in your mouth.Some of you may get sick, but almost everyone survives food poisoning. We think you’ll agree that it’s a small price to pay for the sweet freedom of no one ever being told what to do - and especially not for the silly reason of keeping strangers healthy."
""" I seem to constantly underestimate the weakness of people in my party and the desire of people to slowly give up more and more rights."" How does that not sound like I'm admitting I'm wrong? Never and always are absolutes, and absolutes are rare. Based on that calculator, an 80 year old man that is massively overweight with high blood pressure would only have a 3.8% chance of dying. If he smoked 6 cigarettes a day it goes up to 6%. Those are pretty good odds I'd say. I doubt anyone on this forum comes close to this."

DirtyErnie. Thanks for the read. I have already shared it with many friends and they all thought it was spot on.

How did we get to the Gov of Texas on all these comments when the question was about wearing a mask in Vegas. This site is gotten way too political. Geez stick to the subject & leave politics out of it.
""" I have a 0.06% chance of dying from the Pangolin Plague...""I rarely hear it called the Pangolin Plague, but someone said it just today in an interview. Must have been Matt Gaetz; he is really on top of things."
Wearing a mask “ anywhere “ became a political thing for some people.Speaking of Matt Gaetz...I kept wondering who he reminded me of. Got it:https:/…Beavis
"""Speaking of Matt Gaetz.... Bevis""I think you have something there. Both have a great hair and Matt rivals Bevis in the intellect department."
Bevis kept a teen aged boyfriend in his home?
"""Bevis kept a teen aged boyfriend in his home?""I don't think so."
"So 0.06% per person. What's the time frame on that? A day? How about over a month? Six months? What are the odds then? What about if you can't get a ventilator because they're all being used? I for one have many loved ones, high risk included. It'd kinda suck for me too if one dies from it. So what are the odds for say 25 people?The only people who might find 0.06% even remotely relevant are sociopaths who only care about themselves."
"This fear of ventilators is ridiculous. Even if I got the virus, the odds of me needed hospitalization are extremely low. The odds of needing the ICU are ever lower. My wishes are known, hydroxy-chloroquine, z-pack, and zinc. If that doesn't work, Remdesivir. Not worried at all."
"You do realize just you and Trump are the last two people in the world still clinging to the belief that hydroxy-chloroquine is helpful, right? I haven't heard about z packs and zinc being the new wonder cures. But then again I don't read Breitbart. Remdesivir though can help, but only in very specific situation, not enough to move the needle.Interestingly enough, there is a promising study though showing a low cost plentiful steroid may in fact have broad use. Still early but hopefully in another month or so they'll know more. I find it curious how Trump and the right wing media that peddles the Covid denier nonsense, seemingly don't care. They never mention it despite it being from a highly accredited research facility. But then I remembered, it's low cost and widely available. No way to make any money off of it."
I'm happy for any drug that will help people with this.This is all hypothetical anyway. IF I get the virus. IF I need treatment with a medicine. Whether it works or not doesn't effect you in the slightest as it would be my choice.
still looking forward to my august tripand my december trip.
We’ve been wearing masks in public in NY since April. I’ve gotten used to it and have no problem with it whatsoever. I mean hey you can lip out profanity at someone without them knowing! It’s great!!! HAHA
I>>started a new drinking game today taking a shot for every post not related to the OP.<<your post is surprisingly coherent considering you must have been in the hospital with alcohol poisoning after about 3 minutes of looking at threads
"The only people who might find 0.06% even remotely relevant are sociopaths who only care about themselves.ReplyUpstate Guy. Shame on you. That is a frickin extremely high and mighty post aimed at the statistically inept. YOU wouldn't care about a .06 percent death rate. How do I know? The normal flu, which I'm not comparing the covid to, has a death rate three times higher than .06 percent. Have you ever demanded such radical action for the normal flu? If not, you forgot to do the math and just made a sensational claim. Remember percent mean divide by 100.Edited: 1:03 am, July 03, 2020 "
"Seasonal flu rate is typically 0.12%. The claim of Covid being 0.06% is utterly ridiculous. How could something half as deadly as the flu kill twice as many in 3 months while infecting 1/20th of that of the flu?Edited: 1:36 am, July 03, 2020 "
"it's all completely absurd. media harping on cases and not talking even slightly about HUGELY decreasing death rates. the most overblown, weaponized, politicized, and monetized non-crisis in at least 2 centuries.Edited: 3:18 am, July 03, 2020 "
the only upside for me is that it might get the turd out of the oval and unseat the real commander in chief who leads the senate.

"Relax ESPN, it's just a message board! Have a cold one!"
What is the 'normal' flu? You think there's just this one flu that comes and goes each winter? There's hundreds of variations of flu and each year people get vaccinated for about 4 strains of it. The 4 that they think are most likely.
"Chivas, I think 'normal flu' is the flu that only women get, which as everyone knows is nowhere near as severe as the man flu strain."
ESPN having a bit of a meltdown.
"Have a trip booked starting Nov 9, the week after the election. Covid will only be a memory starting Nov 4 , then and freedom will ring ."
"espn, let's try some simple math then, shall we? Let's assume the unconfirmed cases are 10x. Currently we have 2.9m positives. Ok here is the math part. Ready? 2.9m x 10 = 29 million. Now let's do a comparative analysis. 29 million accounting for 130,000 deaths in 100 days vs 50 million accounting for 60,000 deaths over 150+ days in the worst of years. Btw the CDC extrapolates flu cases in the same manner but generally as a factor of 6. If they were to count flu deaths in the same manner as Covid, annual flu deaths for the last 5 years would range from 3,700 to 15,000 not the 50,000+ they estimate and which is widely accepted as representative of the actual number. It's what the CDC and epidemiologists do. Model, analyze, extrapolate. According to this article the actual weekly death counts of covid vs peak flu weeks is 20 times higher for covid.https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/covid-19/…Edited: 9:13 am, July 03, 2020 "
ESPN continues to refer to those who disagree with him as morons so what does this say about him ?
"A little more on the subject for those interested. This info has been available for months. I found it back then simply because I was curious about the way the CDC operated. I may be a moron, but at least I can provide a basis for my reasoning. Otherwise I'd just be left with capitalizing random words in a weak attempt to appear CORRECT!https:/…https://www.google.com/amp/s/news.yahoo.com/…"
"And of course, another thing to bear in mind is that the Covid 19 death numbers, as bad as they are, would have been significantly higher were it not for the unprecedented lockdowns worldwide."
You can usually tell how intelligent someone is by the namecalling and how stupid one thinks others are.
Plus the millions Trump saved by pretending to stop flights from China and enhanced yet nonexistent screening upon reentry.
"If calling Covid deniers ""wackadoodles"" makes me look stupid, well then I'm prepared to live with that."

I'll take a labradoodle over a whackadoodle every time.
"Even the hypocrites at Fox ""News"" finally got the message, ""Hannity releases PSA urging people to wear masks: 'I don’t have a problem wearing a mask.'"""
"'Chivas, I think 'normal flu' is the flu that only women get, which as everyone knows is nowhere near as severe as the man flu strain.'To be fair, I am surprised we've never had a full lock down before because of the man flu! It can be so bad that my wife struggles to bring me all my drinks whilst rubbing Vick on my chest!"
Jamborino. Without lockdowns deaths would presumably have been X times higher. Cases would presumably have been the same X times higher. So different numbers but the same rates.
"Steve M, I disagree. Both the number of deaths and the death rate percentage would have been higher if hospital services had been overwhelmed, which very likely would have happened in the absence of any lockdowns or other mitigation measures."
"Steve M and jamrobino, we're about to find out just how much availability of medical care affects the CFR, as parts of Arizona have reached capacity. Considering rises in hospitalizations have been shown to lag new case surges by a few weeks, and the fact that new cases in Arizona in the past two weeks have gotten far worse with no signs of abating, Arizona is facing tough times ahead."
"Damn, I've rebooked Vegas for April next year but at this rate it'll be sigma derby with my 2ps in Blackpool!"
"Upstate Guy, yes the thought that some areas/regions could now be on the verge of that nightmare scenario is horrifying. I sincerely hope it doesn't come to that, not least for the brave people on the front line of care services, who are seeing things day in day out that must be very traumatising. They would be at breaking point too."
"Upstate, you mentioned hydroxychloroquine before. Here you go. https:/…hydro-treatment-study"
"Detroit has the Lions and Tigers,too. I trust other studies much more."
"Lions and Tigers,And bears? Oh my"
"No , the Bears is Chicago (not a million miles away from Detroit, admittedly).: )"
"I read where that study is ""the Fort William FC"" of studies."
I'm heading down to San Clemente Beach amd then maybe into San Diego. I also know of an open bar in Orange County. The freewys are very crowded but moving right now. Lancaster is doing fireworks tomorrow in violation of LA County orders. They are calling it a protest.
"Hannity has a PSA on mask wearing,that’s gold!!, Trumps pimp now getting on board, but only after GOP base states seeing severe outbreaks .... before that, not a peep..."
"""I also know of an open bar in Orange County.""Wow. I'd sure want to drive for miles and miles to find an open bar in Orange County. Be sure not to wear a mask let them know that society be damned, you've got your rights!"
Deep OC has it's own culture. Basically anyone I'm around agrees with my stance here.
"""Deep OC has it's own culture.""Did you not know that that Orange County has turned against its former Republican roots and is a pretty solidly Democratic county? Tell us again how this isn't a pandemic and the governor of Texas will never require masks. You sure are smart."
"Yes, I hope to be able to go to LV and wear a mask. However, the current retrictions on returning to NJ/NY/PA area would currently require a 14 day quaranteen upon return. Hope LV somehow lowers the curve a little. Probably won't go if sill under quaranteen regulations.Edited: 7:12 pm, July 03, 2020 "
So why can't someone returning to a place that requires quarantine for 14 night just go get a test on returning? If the test then says you don't have the virus surely you don't need to finish up the 14 nights?Or does it take that long to get in your system?
"""So why can't someone returning to a place that requires quarantine for 14 night just go get a test on returning?""I don't think there is such an option for overriding the 14 days quarantine requirement. Besides, it is not like you can just drop by a doctor's office, get tested, and get the results immediately."
"I will be going the beginning of September for my daughter’s wedding. I will be wearing a mask until there is a vaccine. It is out of respect for others and my husband, who has an underlying condition. It is a small task to do for others and yourself. We do not know when or if we have been in contact with someone who may have been in contact with someone with the virus. I refuse to spread the virus to others, even by accident. I will be wearing a mask.I would not be going if it were not for my daughter."
“ So why can't someone returning to a place that requires quarantine for 14 night just go get a test on returning? ”Because the virus has an incubation period of as long as 14 days. Hence the 14 day quarantine.
Maybe it's different in the UK. I can book a test online and get tested the very next day and then results texted within 2 days!
"“ Maybe it's different in the UK. I can book a test online and get tested the very next day and then results texted within 2 days!”But that doesn’t mean you don’t need to quarantine.You can be exposed to the virus today, get tested tomorrow and still return a “ negative “ result.And then 3 days later...you’re positive. Or 2 days later. Or maybe 9 days..."
That's why I asked
"If we chose to visit right now, we'd have to wear masks and would in Vegas. The state we reside in requires mask use in public ( a proportion of which don't follow the restrictions like everywhere else), and in my work I have to patronize public businesses and residences for lots of reasons. We're used to wearing masks now outside our home..it's a typical part of our days around here. We don't like masks (who does?), but we do it. We still haven't made the decision to pull the trigger on a near future Vegas trip ( though we have September reservations booked). As time progresses during all the uncertainty, the allurement of a Vegas trip becomes stronger. We visited and stayed at a casino in Tucson for three days a couple weeks ago ( masks were required)..the experience was not a nightmare and the casino staff did a great job with compliance and cleanliness protocols. We'll just continue to monitor conditions as the booked Vegas travel dates approach. We'll see."
"No I will not!! This Clovis stuff has been blown way out of proportion. You catch it the same way you catch the regular flue, and nobody goes to such precaution for that. People that are of a higher risk should be a lil more cautious just because.But all the statistics varies so much they're untrustworthy.Plus most importantly!! Out of all the state's and major cities that are having surges (just as stock market is gaining in record time and #'s just months away from election) Minneapolis, and Seattle isn't on that list now How is that possible? With the riots band such hardly anyone wore mask not even the looters. And reported in many need reported that they seemed that it was important for the rioters to be able to protest but not to think it's ok to have family gatherings,or go to churches and other social events. So you can protest an riot and loot, but you can't go to church or other social gatherings!!! It's clear delaying reopening is clearly popolitical. The dems are trying to bust the economy so they can place blame on Trump. And all these deaths why are people not complaining about not going to their furnals, or did they decide their really not their loved one after all!!! To many false reasons on who can n who can't"
It’s always good to present your argument in the most incoherent possible way.
I disagree that this Colvsil stuff has been blown out of proportion.

"My gosh I enjoy watching the news of the “United” states of america…the rest of the world is figuring out how to deal with Covid…including democratic nations, dictator run countries and communist nations. But you continue to wrap yourselves in the constitution and bicker about this party or that, and in the meantime you have become the laughing stock of the rest of the world in how you are not controlling the virus. Love the posts of people complaining about their “rights” to spread the virus by not wearing masks or adhering to the most base level of common sense. Keep providing us with your stupidity…Have fun visiting Brazil Sweden and Russia...it is a welcome relief to dealing effectively with Covid."
No our group of 25 people canceled our yearly trip not wearing mask on 100 plus degree
