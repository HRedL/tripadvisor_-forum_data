"I am trying to pick where to camp with our RV for 3 nights before we continue our road trip East, and would love suggestions.I just booked June 18,19,20 at Difficult Campground in Aspen, excited to hike around the area, bicycle the Rio Grande trail- and all around to just enjoy this area in the summer.We have 3 more nights to spend somewhere- where would you suggest?We are pulling a 36 ft. travel trailer and are open to state parks / national parks/ campgrounds/dispersed camping - all tips appreciated!Looking for good hiking areas/road biking/lakes/rivers/hot springs, etc.....We are driving East to Chicago on June 24th (overnight stop somewhere in Iowa) so we don't want to get too far south or west -unfortunately this means no Telluride/San Juans area on this trip. We would like to stay west of Aspen."
"Referencing your other post so that you don't get replies with the same informationhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g14304…If you will be traveling east to Chicago, did you mean to say that you want to stay east of Aspen as opposed to west of Aspen?"
Maybe Tiger Run in Breckenridge
"yeah whoops! I'm so tired from yoga this morning lolyes, EAST of Aspen pleaseTiger run is ok, thanks for the suggestion- but I'm looking for something a little less developed,more camping style than RV resort - and out of the Vail/Frisco/Dillon area since that is where all my friends live, we could just stay with them if we were staying in the neighborhood =)Edited: 2 years ago "
"In Chaffee County there are many dispersed camping sites Try up by Shavano, there are some nice flat large spots. Close enough to bike into Poncha Springs for beer at Elevation, bonus! https://freecampsites.net/#!51439&query=sitedetails Hot Springs at Mount Princeton, hiking all around. Hit up the cute town of Salida, the historic area, the Arkansas river runs right through downtown. If you want to raft this is the place to do it. https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Revie… https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2xRD4mwENEEdited: 2 years ago "
What about Golden Canyon State Park in Golden? Close to Denver and day trip to Boulder if you wanted. There are hiking trails throughout the park.
No available reservations for those dates for Golden Gate Canyon State Park. Doesn't' appear they have any walk up sites.
In Salida there is a private Campground Four Season that is nice IF you can get a spot by the river if not I'd skip it. Try for R16-24 www.fourseasonsrvpark.biz/contact-us.php
This is not my area of expertise. Is there anything that might work for these folks around Steamboat Springs? Driving time from Steamboat Springs to Chicago would not be any longer than from Salida. It looks like Steamboat Lake State Park has some openings.…state.co.us/placestogo/parks/SteamboatLakeEdited: 2 years ago 
Thank you. I checked and they do have availability in Steamboat Lake State Park =) I think we have decided on that!
Does anyone know if the tree loss from the beetle epidemic is as bad as they say? Would we be better off avoiding the area?
"Are you asking about Steamboat Lake? It's absolutely gorgeous, I've been there twice in the past year. No reason to avoid it!"
Just know that it is not at Steamboat Springs!
