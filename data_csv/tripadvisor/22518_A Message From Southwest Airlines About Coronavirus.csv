Southwest Airlines has published a notice about its Coronavirus cleaning regimen.Here is the link:m.iluv.southwest.com/nl/jsp/m.jsp…I'm sure other airlines are implementing there own policies and procedures.
John L.Thanks for the confirmation from your wife.Also good advice about waiting to the last minute.
"I think Ive received emails from every US carrier saying the same and also allowing cancellations or changes.As far as cancelling and being on hold? It takes about 30 seconds to do any airlines app. No need to call to cancel a flight, or book a flight or change a flight."
"Yes I have received an email like this (Alaska). But no not every ticket is allowing unlimited cancellations or changes. Depends what kind of ticket you are holding, what airline, and when you purchased it."
"i received this in an email from United Airlines plus what they're doing in terms of thorough cleaning.""To give you the greatest flexibility, when you book any flight with us now through March 31, you can change it for free over the next 12 months – any ticket, any fare type, any destination.""Excellent!"
"Re# 6...well, NOT excellent if you have already booked a flight! Southwest doesn't charge at all, and Delta today announced they would allow any booking to change. Not that I want to change, but it is pretty stinky of United in my opinion to allow people that haven't booked yet to be able to make changes, but those of us that have been booked for MONTHS to not. Argh."

"The WestJet comments are interesting. I don't think it's realistic that flight attendants can to a thorough cleaning on a quick return. Bring your own cleaning supplies, esp. for return flights from Mexico. I personally find the flight to Mexico very clean, but the flight home on a quick turnaround, not so much."
"Well CalBerry, I totally agree....I don't think the airlines should charge for changes at any time."
"In many of the aviation forums I frequent, this press release from Southwest is being laughed at as a joke. No airline spends 6-7 hours overnight cleaning a plane. (some don't even spend that much time on the ground overnight! They end their last flight of the day after midnight and start their first flight of the day at 5:30 or 6 or so) They are probably being clever and counting each person cleaning the plane as a man hour So each plane gets 6 to 7 man hours of cleaning each night. (Southwest does not have overnight flights and all their aircraft are parked overnight). Instead of 6 people on board cleaning the aircraft for 15 minutes, they now spend a whole hour cleaning the plane. Most of Southwest's aircraft have 5-6cycles a day with quick turns (maybe 4 a day if a longish transcon or Hawaiian flight is in one of the segments.) If anyone has been a thru passenger on a Southwest flight that continues on to another destination, you see that the crew does practically nothing to clean the cabin in the few minutes between the deplaning passengers get off and new passengers start boarding. For example, lets take Southwest's flight from Houston today and track that particular aircraft's planned movements today. 3./10/20 N705SW, a 21 year old 737-700Freshly cleaned, it'll start it's day in TampaTampa-Dallasthen Dallas-Houstonthen Houston-Puerto Vallartathen Puerto Vallarta back to Houstonthen Houston to New Orleansthen New Orleans to Chicago where it is done for the night then cleaned again. How clean do you think that plane will be by the end of the day? How many people have flown on it? This statement is nothing but lip service."
