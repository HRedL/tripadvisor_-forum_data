I can't believe peoples lack of social responsibility re: the Corona virus. People say I'm still going to Vegas because I'm not sick or no one in Vegas has it- well all not true. Testing in the US has been and still not even close to being under control. Tests aren't available although the government says they are. 200 cars line up in Denver every day and no one is getting tested. You may be have it and not no it yet so now you're possibly going spread it to others. It spreads exponentially the infection curve is at least 7 days. They're now talking about a possible planned shut down of NYC. Wouldn't be surprised if more of this is coming. The only way this gets better is for people to not interact. The risk of overloading hospitals is real - jeopardizing not only patients but our health care workers. Stay home - be responsible and think beyond yourself !
In life there are always those who only care about themselves
"With respect, I think you are overblowing it a little bit, but I completely agree that people need to think beyond themselves at this time. I may easily recover, but the elderly or immunocompromised person I interact with later could be badly affected."
"No one should have high expectations of social responsibility or good information about this sort of thing from an internet travel forum. Hell, you need to have a pretty discerning eye just to get good information about travel from a travel forum."
"True and lol, Slade."
Agree the majority of people will recover but that's not a reason to say ahh no big deal I'll get over it. To your point and mine in my post it's who it could spread to an affect. I'm not trying to over blow anything but unless precautions are taken we'll be looking like Italy - not a good situation.
"I""m not in an at-risk group, and I won't be around people who are at risk unless they're stupid enough to be traveling. They need to exercise personal responsibility. If people can't exercise personal responsibility, then they don't get to whine about anybody else's duties to social responsibility."
So...I take it Richard isn't going to Vegas anytime soon
"Isn't it socially responsible to keep life as near normal as possible and thereby keeping people in their jobs ,?"
"""When thousands of young, healthy people are dying in a month in each state, then call it a pandemic.""When you have people saying things like this, what do you expect?"
Apparently Richard was scheduled to go to Kauai in March. Jeez FLW let it go!
say the same things as you'd say to the crazies on here who talk about tens of millions of deathsgrow up. learn to read. .
"“When you have people saying things like this, what do you expect?“Unless a leader or agency is saying this it is simply one opinion.I saw video last night of really large crowds watching the live music at the Fremont Street Experience. Total shock at the large crowds. Many, many people not listening to warnings. I am staying isolated off Strip for the time being.Edited: 2:00 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"i saw on social media that #StayTheFHome is trending, largely because of what people who are old or immunocompromised talking about how they're at risk. they should stay at home like they're supposed to, and people who know they're going to be around them stay home as well, It's a fact that people outside of those populations are at very low risk for developing anything but mild symptoms. If the at-risk groups are in those Fremont Street Experience crowds inseenoman is talking about , then they're putting themselves at risk. blaming everybody is mind-numblingly stupid.Edited: 2:04 pm, March 15, 2020 "

They still have to buy groceries, go to doctor's appointments, get gas etc. They'll still be interacting with society, but less so."
Where I live and work in the UK there are 25 confirmed infections out of nearly 3m population - That’s Surrey and Essex combined - forgive me if I think it’s a bit of a media drive frenzy
"The area I live in is almost certainly in greater risk than Las Vegas. The big companies and organizations are all taking steps to be responsible members of society. So what should we do? Shut down our two small businesses? People rely upon us. We intend to be there for them. There is no place without risk. So what should we do ? We can avoid large groups. And in fact every city in our area restricts groups of people, usually to 100. I will tell you what we have been doing, You may not agree that it is important, and IAH I don't care. But I feel in our own small way, we are helping.We went to a Sports Bar for a late lunch yesterday. There are NO sports taking place in this country. We watched a car auction and a 2009 college basketball game while eating.Last night we had dinner at a small local Chinese restaurant, and a few nights ago at a family owned diner. All were very appreciative for our business.During challenging times we go out of our way to support the small businesses that have always been there for us. And it looks like times will be challenging for a while.Edited: 2:22 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Ktinca, I agree completely. In Los Angeles, where there is much more confirmed infections, the smaller restaurants are especially hit hard by this epidemic. The grocery stores where we live are all open with plenty of food and delivery, but in lieu of cooking at home, I actually prefer to support our local restaurants by ordering takeout/delivery food - safer for us and safer for the staff at the restaurants we love and support."
"Where I live and work in the UK there are 25 confirmed infections out of nearly 3m population - The problem is nobody knows the number of unreported infections, when the UK total was around 500 confirmed infections the Chief Medical Officer was saying the actual number of infections was probably somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000."
I went to Costco this week it was wall to wall people. Insane. I probably had more chance of contracting the virus there then going on a Vegas vacation.

"I was suppose to leave for LV in two weeks, and two weeks ago, I was one of those who thought people where overreacting. But I read and hear news. Not just from my country. From your country, from Italy, Norway, Great Britain from Reuthers and WHO. Today we are on lockdown in Denmark. Everything is closede, our borders are Closed. The fear for Corona is not about you and me, who are healthy. It's not about weather or not we get the disece or not. It's not even about getting testet or not anymore. It is about your healthcare system, and what we ALL can do, to make sure it can keep up when (not if!) people get sick from this and need intensive care. I really don't understand why that is so hard to understand? Don't people read and here news from outside the US?? Please do whatever you can to take care of those around us!! https:/…12italy-coronavirus-health-care.html"

"One of the popular Vegas twitter accounts, Vital Vegas has been saying how people are needlessly panicking, have lost reason and people should still come to Vegas. It's almost like the Seven Stages of Loss and many are still in denial."
"And to show you what's going on in Nevada, a candidate for the Clark County School Board, Katie Williams tweeted a photo of her at Red Robin gleefully noting that she's under 30, in good health so she won't get Covid19."
Seems like a post that should go on your personal Facebook page...…
"“forgive me if I think it’s a bit of a media drive frenzy” - You still think that even though Italy, China, El Salvador, New Zealand, Poland, Ireland, and Denmark have implemented large and restrictive mass quarantines that essentially put the entire countries on lockdown and the WHO has labeled this a global pandemic?13"
You know it's serious when they decide to close the pubs and bars in Ireland!BBC News - Coronavirus: Pubs asked to close by Irish governmenthttps:/…world-europe-51901372
"The truth is if hospitals suddenly get thousands of people who need beds we are in worse shape. The hospitals are already understaffed, people have stolen necessary medical equipment from hospitals to sell and make profit leaving nurses vulnerable to virus. ( yes many nurses have high risk diabetes, heart issues, or are elderly). In Italy there are no beds for newly diagnosed so drs must choose who to treat and who must succumb to virus. I doubt anyone would want a loved one in that situation. I’m not panic driven but I am prepared and socially aware that my actions affect others. Unfortunately until everyone becomes responsible our government will be forced to protect by closing everything and our economy will certainly suffer."

"@espnawards To argue that only the old or immuno-compromised be the ones who take precautions is both the most ignorant and utterly selfish thing I've heard yet. This is 70 million people you're saying should be trapped inside their homes for months on end while the rest of us are allowing the virus to spread to every corner of the world.Aside from the fact that it wouldn't work and would be a death sentence for millions, you're also saying it's no big deal that our health care system becomes permanently overrun.For Mitigation to work EVERYONE needs to do their part. Take your precious trip espnawards, the one you've shedded every last fiber of your moral decency to preserve. But please, enough of your cruel willful ignorance.Edited: 4:16 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"""Jeez FLW let it go!""When he admits how shockingly stupid this comment was I'd be glad to."
carlettems great post. That message is being broadcast loud and clear today by government officials on all the news outlets. When you layer a spike of coronavirus patients on top of seasonal flu our health system will break. They're no additional ventilators for sale at any price.Look at Iran they're building mass grave sites for the huge percentage of deaths as it relates to the virus. Their health system is so bad that top government officials are dying from the virus.
"Is it not a case that the ball is in the other court?If visiting Las Vegas amounts to being socially irresponsible, then the powers-that-be should close it until such time that safe attendance is possible."
Would any one like me to hear my comments?
