"Hi all,Im shortly going to Bangkok and Phuket for 2 weeks. I intend to take £1,000 with me. I'm reading up about how to exchange my money and im seeing posts from a few years back but im wondering if anyone has some more up to date advice. Is it better for me to:- exchange half of money here in the uk and take the rest in sterling and exchange when i get to Thailand. I see people mentioning that in Bangkok and Phuket there are shacks on the road that exchange at a better rate and no commission fee, if so, where are these situated and are they easy to find?-exchange all my money here in the UK- or exchange a little here for when i arrive incase of travel to hotel and take all the rest in UK cash and change it all when i get to thailand?Thanks for answering in advance :)"
"If you land in bangkok change your money on the bottom floor, where the train station is"
"Hello and welcome to the forum. Your question does come up a few times a week. The problem is the search , on the forum. It brings up the old ones !!!As a general rule you are better to exchange in the Kingdom. However in recent times the gap from getting the best rate in the UK and Thailand has narrowed. I have not kept a note of the seller in the UK that you go on line so perhaps someone will advise this.I have done many FX transaction in Thailand. I suggest use www.daytodaydata.net. I find that I take the top 5 rates ,then get an average. This is spot on most time to what I have bought baht at.There are plenty of FX exchangers all over Thailand. The more Tourist the more FX !!Chok DeeEdited: 5:00 pm, February 25, 2020 "
Just to clarify above poster means Kingdom of Thailand not the UK/United Kingdom.Change it all in Thailand and next time (assuming too short notice now) get a Halifax Clarity Card which has no fx fees and is very cheap to withdraw cash abroad.
"Yup, second Halifax Clarity Card...best UK bank card for travel"
"""or exchange a little here for when i arrive incase of travel to hotel and take all the rest in UK cash and change it all when i get to thailand?""That is your best option !You will always get a better rate of exchange changing money in Thailand, than UK."
Not always depends where you change money.
"Yes you will get a slightly better rate in Thailand, there is not much in it though. Here are today,s rates in various places, best in the UK (order online for home delivery) £1 = 40.489 Baht, best in Bangkok £1 = 40.9 Baht, airport rail link station (you should get about the same in Phuket) £1 = 40.6 Baht. So if you exchange at the best rate in Bangkok you will save approx £10 on you £1,000."
"""So if you exchange at the best rate in Bangkok you will save approx £10 on you £1,000.""£10 !!!! That's at least 5 Chang beers !! :)"
Today at Vasu Bangkok 41.25. Impact of Coronavirus on Thai economy.
"Best rates in UK are similar or better than the Thai banks. If going to Bangkok I would change there, even at ARL at airport rates will be better. For large amounts I would check on daytoday site or just go SuperRich HQs. Best rate I’m seeing 41.3 today. In uk I see 40.667.Edited: 3:42 am, February 26, 2020 "
