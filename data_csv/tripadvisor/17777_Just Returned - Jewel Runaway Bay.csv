"Returned from JRB two weeks ago, loved it! Have never had better service at any hotel in Jamaica! Will post a review when my photos are uploaded. If you have specific questions, I'm happy to help."
Can you visit the other Jewel resorts and eat/drink ?
where did u think the best rooms were? We booked a basic premier room and some room tips have said to not be near the construction side and also the mosquito issue makes me want to request a second floor room. Thoughts?
"Im warning you right now.....I've been home for 3 weeks and I'm still ""home sick."" Can't wait to go back! Glad you had a good trip...couldn't agree more...best resort on the island!"
Same question as jjduncan but also which rooms get the most sun such as sunrise and sunset? Also are any of the basic rooms with an ocean view even a partial ocean view? Thanks!
"We didn't try to visit other Jewel properties so not sure. We were in the block of rooms closest to the ocean next to the restaurant construction and loved that block, can't beat the sea view and the construction didn't bother us and we were at the end of the building where the construction was taking place. I would request a higher floor however, I do that just for privacy. We had no mosquito issue, we did use a citronella candle when on the balcony. From how the other buildings were position I would think some may have had a partial view but not much, sorry I can't provide more detail on that subject.Thanks SentraGrlGXE it truly was the best all around!"
"Hi Sammy b glad to hear you had a great time, did you happen to notice if anyone was smoking on their balcony lol ?"
"Yes, I did see at least one person smoking on his balcony."
"Wow that's good to know for my morning coffee :) thanks, was there lots of beach chairs available when you were there?"
Yes tons of chairs
That good news too thanks :)
"Sammy B, is the JRB 24 hr all inclusive , my tour company was unable to answer this ??Many Thanks"
Meaning is there food/drinks available 24 hours? I THINK room service is 24 hours. What I will tell you is I've stayed at AI's with limited hours and issues with trying to find food during untraditional times and that was definitely not an issue with this property.
"Hi Julie, you can get food from somewhere 24hrs. The grill is open from 11am through to 7am, then the breakfast buffet starts so you can always grab a bite to eat. All rooms have a fridge which is kept topped up with soft drinks (alcohol if you're in an upgraded room). There's also a coffee maker in every room. You can also get tea and coffee 24hrs from the lobby area. Hope that helps."
Hi Sammydo they have HobieCat boats to sail? wind surfers?Thanks MonBob
"Hi Eric, they have hobiecats but not for 'self' use due to safety reasons, you can go out with a member of the watersports team. No wind surfs but water skiing ($ cost).To answer some of the other questions, there are a few of the premier rooms where you will get a 'glimpse' of the sea. Here's a link to the resort layout. www.resortsmaps.com/popup.htmlâ€¦"
"Hi Eric,Yes, what Dawn said,"
Forgot to say that the waterpark is being constructed behind the 1000 block.
Did it rain while you were there? It calls for rain most of next week. I am wondering if it is warm rains you can be out in or quick storms or all day scenarios.
"I was looking at the weather forecast for next week as well, last time I was in jamacia I found when it did rain it was just quick sprinkling then gone"
"Yes, it did didn't last all day and you are beyond hurricane season so I wouldn't suspect an all day down pour"
Gosh. These reports are making me can't wait til feb!!
how did airport transfers for JRB work? We booked resort only through expedia and it said transfers were included but they don't have our airline info. Is there someone always at the airport waiting or should I call and let them know when to pick us up?
"There's a desk just outside the airport, usually on the right hand side before Margaritavilles, however I would notify JRB of your flight details. Please have a paper copy of your booking with you as the guys at the airport desk will ask to see it."
Heading to Jewell Runaway Bay Nov. 8th. Does anyone know what is being done to prevent chickungunya virus spread by mosquitos? It is now an epidemic on the island and people are concerned there by the poor response by Department of Public Health.
"Hi sbjk, whilst JA has been declared 'in a state of emergency' this is purely to obtain additional funding from the WHO. They're quoting that up to 60% of residents have had ChikV but that the numbers being infected are decreasing. The main problem areas are built up residential areas where water is allowed to lay stagnant. JRB regularly fog outdoors and spray rooms indoors and ensure there is no laying water.However, as is normal for a tropical climate, if you're susceptible to bites then ensure to take adequate bug spray."
