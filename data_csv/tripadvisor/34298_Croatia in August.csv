Hi guys I am 64 years old and due to go to Croatia-Dubrovnik in August I wonder if the tourist areas are all open and if boat trips are still running ? I am slightly frightened to fly ( from Edinburgh Scotland ) but would appreciate anyone who has done so recently telling me their stories and opinion Thank you
thank you
