"What with the flu epidemic, have they started any health checks at the airport yet? I remember back in 2009 we had to sign forms and have our temperatures checked. That was a strange time. The resorts were over half empty."
I haven’t heard anything like that. I went twice in 2009 and that didn’t happen to us. I think if that started happening it would be all over this board.
"That was in 2009 during the swine flu scare. They did take temps at the airport during part of that time. I don't think it would work to put temp checks inplace during this flu season, that was a pandemic or so they daid.Edited: 2 years ago "
