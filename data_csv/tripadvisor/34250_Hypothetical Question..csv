"News reports from around the world are reporting that Governments are being urged to relax some of the lockdown restriction now in place to start to get the economy going. As the world economy needs to improve for all sorts of reasons (a different discussion) I would agree with this up to a point as long as the general population are not put at any further risk, and we know how much money talks with very powerful enterprises lobbying Governments. My question is :-If Governments, Airlines, Airports, Travel Agents and Resort owners somehow came to a decision to introduce their own tailored restrictions like health checks by airports and airlines and social distancing requirements on aircraft and at airports etc and relax existing travel restrictions to enable Resorts to accept travellers to take effect sometime before the end of 2020 would you still plan a holiday to the Maldives for this year or anytime in the future before a cure is found for Covid-19."
"My answer to the question would be that I would not travel anywhere abroad until a cure is found, I would even have to think twice before booking a holiday in the UK."
No. I don't think a cure will be found but hopefully a vaccine
"i have a holiday to the maldives planned for october since our march one got canceled. i plan on going as long as the borders are open (30% chance about that happening...), which should indicate that the situation is improving. the next 2 months will be crucial in understanding how this disease will evolve into the end of the years, especially with cases in the maldives growing at the rate that they are. however, i don’t want to travel unless there is somewhat of a solution in place. if the maldives reopens with the same exact plan as before wrt dealing with covid. that is, locking down a resort every time someone coughs, which is what we saw happen in march... that was highly inconvenient for everyone since people were forced to reschedule flights, transfers, etc and was more of a nightmare than a mess. a vaccine will not be available until next summer. i’d like to think that before then, even without a vaccine, our governments and airlines will have some sort of plan of action in place to make traveling safer and streamlined. i’m positive that if resorts stay closed until next year, most wont survive."
@ AussieAngeSorry wrong choice of words
"Hi, We would travel if there wereA) reliable flight schedules (and no cancellation of all ops within 48hrs like on EK this year)B) Sensible and appropriate measurements from the Maldivian government C) would stick to a resort closer to the airport for the ease of transfer, just in case „if“ D) just go to ALC dining restaurants and avoid self-service buffets E) there are accurate deals around and prices did not skyrocket in order to make up for former losses. I think it is a hypothetical question for now and we have to see how things will develop within the next few months. I hope everyday, things will turn normal again or at least one of the (already existing) medications is really impactful - maybe remdesivir will be....Edited: 7:26 pm, April 29, 2020 "
"My answer to the original poster :You'd see me at the boarding gate the second after I'm allowed to travel, regardless of what the governments, airlines, hotels etc... decide to do.That's valid for any country I'm interested in visiting, not just the Maldives.That doesn't mean though that I would hug every single person I happen to meet, I've never done it, and I wouldn't start now. Basically I wouldn't change anything to the way I've been traveling so far, except for whatever new measures which would be imposed on me (testing, wearing of masks etc... )"
"Having watched my Brother suffer this awful virus and feel so ill he was telling us what he wanted at his funeral and who is still not fully fit five weeks later and he is one of the lucky ones, there is no way I would contemplate any travel anywhere for the foreseeable future. Certainly not until there is a vaccine and infection rates are nil and they know one way or another if past sufferers have immunity.Despite being physically fit Hubby is in the vulnerable category due to age and I am not far behind him and we feel really vulnerable. We are not even going into shops let alone airports. Whilst we would love to get away as we love our holidays, in reality we see it as a still distant dream.Edited: 4:55 am, April 30, 2020 "

"In the interest of finding out what inconveniences travellers would be prepared to accept, are there any restrictions that you would accept to enable you to go on holiday. For example if one of the restrictions bought in by the travellers government included the compulsory self isolation for say 7 days for anyone returning to their home country from abroad would you contemplate booking a short holiday (5 to 7 days) and accept the 7 day isolation as part of your holidayEdited: 5:35 am, April 30, 2020 "
"I think I would shy away from booking for the fear of contraction. Until a vaccine (or effective treatment) is found, COVID19 will be (a) relatively prevalent, and (b) relatively painful. Re: the former, COVID19 will be especially prevalent in travel because true social distancing is near impossible (crowds of people, air re-circulation in planes).Re: the latter, one might not die, but you would be extremely miserable (I have a number of friends who have had it and a couple of friends who have died). I think if I had to suffer through my own personal bout of COVID19, I would want to do it in the comfort of my home (and not ruin an expensive holiday) as well as close to easily accessible high quality health care (in the event that my case was hazardously acute).What would change this preference, of course, is if I could confirm that I had already contracted it in the past (sero-immunological tests available). Then, despite some questions being raised about potential for re-infection, I would go ahead and go.I suspect that long-haul luxury travel is likely going to be increasingly the exclusive domain of the super-rich (who can either afford private jet travel), or the new elite class of COVID-immune individuals.Bruce, Maldives Completewww.maldivescomplete.com"
"#1 answers it perfectly as far as I am concerned. No way. Much as I love our holidays, especially Maldives ones (obvs!) there are things that matter much more to me ... in particular hubbo's and my own health.Edited: 6:31 am, April 30, 2020 "
"Just to qualify, my decision not to travel in question #1 is also somewhat based on Mrs M & I both being in the ""Vulnerable"" class due to our age and some health issues but even if we were younger knowing what we do about Covid-19 I still wouldn’t travel until there was a reliable vaccine."
"As already wrote on another topic, I had to cancel my April trip and I have reservations (confirmed before the pandemic) for September 2020.If my country lets me out, if Maldives lets me in, if the island is fully operational and if flights are not canceled, I will almost certainly be there in September.Of course, everything depends on the evolution of the disease for better or for worse, but I have great hopes that in September everything will be much calmer."
"#12 MrMistyYou could have written that bit for me too! Hubbo is well over 70, I am not there yet but he also has a medical condition, the medication for which makes him even more vulnerable although he didn't receive The Letter.Edited: 7:04 am, April 30, 2020 "
I have the same opinion as Viktor P. One difference - we have a reservation for October.Niky
"Ummm, purely personal opinions about what I would do, not what I think other people should do (as I have no opinion about that and wouldn't dream of forming one)…I recognise that C19 is now a part of life, currently and in the future. I anticipate that we may have proven therapeutics (support and treatment) before we have a vaccine, if we ever have a long-lasting vaccine. I have a short trip within Northern Europe booked for September. If it is possible to proceed with that, I am confident to take my family and do so, on the basis that it is just a few days and I am content that the hospital facilities will be as good as Britain's (which, in case there are any of the doom-sayers on this forum that seem to frequent some social media, are excellent) if we were to need them.But the Maldives is a bit different. For starters, it's a long haul flight, which carries different transmission risks than short haul or the train etc. Then, I may be a long way from hospital care should I require it, and at this stage I am not convinced that the care available would equal the care available here. I anticipate that airlines will start to clean and disinfect planes thoroughly as standard going forward - not a moment too soon IMO. And I think passengers will also wash and sanitise their hands appropriately (let's hope the non-hand-washers have wised up and stay that way!). And I anticipate that the Maldives will put a great deal of effort into ensuring that the critical care available is excellent as soon as they are able, and would expect them to ensure it is available to tourists at no charge for the period that travel insurance excluded C19. If they don't do this, I can't see how they hope to tempt the vast majority of tourists back with confidence.I also anticipate that they will maintain the hygiene levels introduced during February this year - hopefully forever. Who ever thought it was okay to not provide hand sanitiser on the way into buffet restaurants? I take my own!Taking those things into account, I will be happy to visit when we have evidence-based therapeutics at the ready.I am loosely starting to plan for June/July 2021..."
"I tend to go by the numbers :)If we were in a higher risk demographic, I'd maintain significant social distancing, let alone travel, until they have improved therapies (probably more likely than vaccine). Unless the data proves to be inaccurate and your risk factors are actually a lot lower than being suggested now. I suspect for some demographics we'll see risk revised down once the dust settles and the data is purged of inaccurate entries.As we're not in a particularly high risk demographic, we'll probably travel providing we are indemnified. Both against cancelation due to another lockdown and should we require medical treatment. The headache of having my money stuck and needing to file claims to recover it will likely put me off, so resorts/airlines will have to entice me with generous cancelation commitments.Yes the Maldives doesn't have healthcare facilities comparable to London/etc. But that applied pre COVID-19 as well. Over the years we've accepted the risk we could contract Dengue, Malaria, African trypanosomiasis, etc in many countries with poor health care systems.By the time they let us loose, I suspect the risks of contracting COVID-19 will be significantly lower. Once I then factor in our pretty low risk of complication, it doesn't strike me as that much riskier then the many illnesses we've rolled the dice with. Especially when I factor in my wife works in a major London hospital, so we'll face a higher than average risk back home.Best of luck to everyone once they start travelling."
there is going to be the second wave for sure. too much economic pressure for not opening. and “80% will self heal ” as for nature lovers， everyone knows there is no controling over nature.if you can afford maldives， most likely you in the potentialy lethal category. therefore how many will risk going under the circumstances
everyone is screwed by the virus. even I am from China. I still question why the hell do I have to suffer when the original case is thousands miles away from beijing.deep down inside ，I am like every other person， I shout F U silently who ever started thiswhen the vaccine comes out in a couple of years I am heading towards 40. thank you for f up my life

"I second Ray and Jen from Texas, my government (here in France) too has abysmally managed the crisis by locking up the young and the healthy, and I'd take the first chance I can to ""irresponsibly"" travel while abiding to whatever rule is imposed by the countries that will host me, just as I ""irresponsibly"" wander freely in winter in my own country, spreading the deadly flu virus of which thousands die each year, as my ""irresponsible"" government has so far allowed me to (but for how long ?)Edit : that was in response to the previous deleted postEdited: 9:38 am, May 04, 2020 "

"Hi NicolasMay I first clarify I have no issues with members decisions as to whether they would go on holiday in relation to my original Hypothetical Question, whether they would go or not is entirely their own decision. My decision not to travel at this time was based mainly on my age (we are classed as vulnerable) and the fact that there is no effective vaccine at the moment.In reply to your post I didn’t see the deleted post so I don’t know what was said.You say in your post that you can “wander freely in winter in my own country, spreading the deadly flu virus of which thousands die each year, as my irresponsible government has so far allowed me to”. If you have had the “deadly flu virus” it’s doubtful you would be in any fit state to wander freely and even if you could would you want to, this is where your own personal decisions come into effect.One point I would raise in relation to winter flu is that there are vaccines for various forms of winter flu whereas there isn’t one yet for Covid-10, imagine how many more people may have died of flu if there was not a vaccine, and on a second point your “irresponsible government” hasn’t “allowed you to freely wander” it just hasn’t put any restrictions on you in relation to winter flu, in effect leaving the decision up to you as to whether to travel knowing any risks involved.I am sure that Governments haven’t taken the decision to lock down / restrict movements lightly when you think of the economic crash it has caused.As I have said my original post was just hypothetical and all replies have equal value and no judgements should be made."
"Mr-Misty47, I don't think Nicholas' post was in any way aimed at you :) The deleted post was personal and rude (again).I'm not sure why some people can't politely give their own opinions without being abusive to people whose opinions differ."
"MrM, hopefully it’s clear my final paragraph was also not in response to your post :)"
"@ MaldiveI didn’t think Nicholas' post was aimed at me, from reading between the lines I took it that someone (in the deleted post) had made some comments about Nicholas being irresponsible and I agree no one should be judgemental of other members opinions and yes I took it that your last comment was not aimed at me.The reason I replied to his post was to point out that we all have to make decisions based on our own risk assessments of any given situation unless the decision is taken out of our hands e.g. Government intervention.In my eyes the difference between Covid-19 and winter flu is that there is a vaccine for winter flu, albeit not 100% effective and the period it is active is mainly limited the winter months."
"So wishing to travel once traveling is allowed (and who can possibly imagine that traveling will be allowed without the strictest restrictions and sanitary measures ever devised ?) is ""stupid"", interesting. I guess this is Stupid Forum then"
"Hi ar_perthIf you read my original post the answer lies in the title “Hypothetical Question”. In reply to your comment “well suck it up because in the current circumstances if those sort of comments are not called out for what they are then good luck to you all...enjoy your EasyJet flights”, no one is suggesting they would travel under the present circumstances in fact it would be nigh on impossible, members were replying to a Hypothetical scenario where travel would be allowed if certain restrictions were in place (as described in my question), with modified restrictions in place I just asked if members would still be willing to go on holiday or not, there was no mention of would you travel under current circumstances.As travellers we all make risk assessments on decisions relating to travelling abroad like :- Is the destinations country safe in relation to terrorism - what if I take sick on holiday” – will I have to go in lock-down when I return from holiday - is there a local hospital, some travellers have a higher risk threshold than others meaning they are willing to accept the risk based on their own circumstances."
"Mr-Misty47, thank you for your thoughtful and balanced post.Yes, mine was in answer to the one that got deleted, which called people who were eager to travel as soon as it would be possible ""irresponsible"", and claimed we should be ""utterly ashamed""To clarify my post (which was written somewhat in anger, I must admit) the ""deadly flu"" of which I am talking is the many seasonal varieties which we know from a long time, and which do cause thousands of deaths each year, mostly among the vulnerable population. That's why I called it deadly. And it is a fact that I have probably helped spread it many a winter, since I was neither aware of having it (I am lucky that a sore throat or a runny nose doesn't preclude me for moving around), nor locked at home by order of my government. And it is therefore pretty sure that down the line I must have caused the death of someone - by definition, a virus spreads because people carry it around, if they didn't, they wouldn't be any virus.Call (not you, of course) me ""responsible"".As you framed it in the original question, it is a matter of risk assessment. But, as much as I am in the position of deciding the level of risk to which I am willing to subject myself, it is not something I can do for others, because it is subjective. As long as I breathe, no matter what I do, I am at risk, and I put others at risk. Be it if I take my car (hypothetical car, which in real life I don’t possess), be it when I take a plane, be it when I wander around towns spreading germs and viruses. It seems to me that only as a society we can decide what level of risks we can subject each other to (for instance when we set speed limits on roads), and that cannot be a decision for each individual to make.I understand the point about the vaccine, although as you say it is neither entirely effective (a friend of mine who is a nurse in Italy puts its efficiency at around 30%), nor compulsory, for vulnerable groups or the general population. But as an individual, am I supposed to calculate the R0 of the current virus, it’s lethality, the effectiveness of the cures and vaccines, etc… to decide whether I should be free to move or not ? How could I do that ? Should I factor in media exposure as well ?Like you said, governments haven’t taken the decision to shut down economies lightly. Likewise, I’m sure that when they’ll allow travel again, they’ll have pondered carefully the pros and cons and measured the risks (and erred on the side of caution, that is my hunch). So that’s why I take exception when people who would then wish to travel are called « irresponsible » and « shameless »"
Mr Perth - before you comment not knowing someone’s full story you probably should take your own advice. Let each have their opinion. First of all we know travel will probably not commence until next year. We can all wish and dream to get us through these days though. Secondly myself and my wife are both medical personnel who have been working through this pandemic only to get the disease in itself. Luckily we are fine and have built immunity. Knowing this is a novel virus I cannot say I have immunity to it - but if this is like other diseases then we are willing to take our chance with our antibodies. When you start to purchase my travel expenses you can definitely have a say of where I can and should go. In the meantime let each have their own. I highly respect your opinion on staying home until this is resolved. I would be right there with you if I hadn’t developed the antibodies.
"I appreciate the comparison to Flu (Influenza A, B & C) was more in response to the previous post, but there are some factors which explain the heightened concern with this virus.The caveat of course being we've had a long time to understand the Flu, whilst the data for SARs-COV2 is still potentially unreliable (they're still refining the models for H1N1).1) Early indications are SARs-COV2 has a higher R0, between 2 & 3 versus ~1.3. Which is a far far bigger difference than the numbers may suggest. Think back to high school maths and binomial expansions.2) The case mortality rate appears to be significantly higher:https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30257-7/fulltextParticularly for older demographic. Populations in Europe/US/etc are skewed towards this demographic, compared with some other countries.3) There's always a concern when a virus jumps the species barrier. There's likely been a viable recombination/mutation. At this stage we can't be sure of the propensity of SARs-COV2 to mutate/recombination. RNA virus's are generally poor replicators (relatively). However, Corona virus's aren't generally considered to be good at creating new viable strains. But every host represents lots of opportunities for the virus to take a wrong turn :/ Hence it's advisable to restrict the number of rolls of the dice it gets.4) Flu is out of the bag. If Flu had arrived today we may well have instigated a similar lock down. But it's endemic now and will be hard to suppress. Do we want to allow another potentially more dangerous virus to become endemic? Particularly given it appears to operate outside of traditional flu season.This pandemic will form the lifes work of exceptional mathematicians, virologists and economists. So there will be nowhere to hide for Governments and the scientists advising them. Whilst I'm certain there will be errors, IMO they will be margin calls. Even if you believe they are callous and don't care about deaths, they surely will care about their reputation. With the judgement of history to come, are any of these people really going to go out on a limb?Somewhat surreal times, I still wake up thinking is this really happening. It could quite easily be the script of a movie. But also interesting for anyone interested in the modelling and maths behind it."
"NB: When the restrictions are lifted I'll be travelling. Equally whilst the restrictions are in force i'll be obeying them.This isn't a zero sum game. Unless we're going to pay people to sit at home, lots of people will suffer if tourism stops completely. Particularly those in countries that don't have social security net."
"Frusci, it is so going to be the script of a movie...presumably several, made in different countries, with an emphasis on each's experiences and high profile players."
"Maldiva, I'm sure you're right.Also each country will tell the story that suits them.Chinese script will say a team of US agents let it loose in Wuhan.Hollywood's script will say it was engineered in Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory (BL4).Our's will be the emotional tale of a chubby man (with messy hair) and his personal fight against SARs-COV2. With a little Segway for a gnome called Jeremy to tell us he was right all along :D"
"French will plagiarise the script of I am legend, but swear blind they based it on the novel.I am Sarkozy"
"Frusci, very interesting post #34Incidentally, in France it would be ""I am Macron""And it would be of the dystopian horror genreThe scariest quote of the movie : ""We will limit iinternational travel (05/05/2020)""Worst.movie.everEdited: 2:38 pm, May 05, 2020 "
"Ooops, meant to say Marcon, mind must be in time warp :DAt least I didn't say Le Pen :D"
I think sub consciously I preferred the juxtaposition of a tiny Sarkozy against a towering Will Smith in the original.I believe Macron is taller than he seems (probably my British conditioning of French leaders).
"Another Covid movie script could be a horror movie, starting off with a couple honeymooning in Maldives. Then Covid strikes and the staff leave the island, accidentally leaving the honeymoon couple behind. It then becomes a fight for survival as one (or both) couples starts to get symptoms."
"In answer to the hypothetical question -- it would also depend on having health insurance/travel insurance that covers the trip. (I live in Singapore. Current rules are -- you can travel but you're not covered for Covid if you come back with it.) Will travel insurance realistically cover Covid in the future?Also, I would prioritize travel for business and seeing family over a Maldives vacation. After going through that backlog, it'll probably be summer 2021."

"For us, there’ll be no travel outside the UK until there is a vaccine, due to underlying health issues for my partner. Once we have a vaccine, we will be booked and flying everywhere! For now, UK doggy holidays it will be, which I love just as much! The prospect of the Maldives, as much as we love it, actually isn’t top of our list right now, even if there was a vaccine. I’d much rather spend time with family and friends, and enjoy what we have in the UK. Things like this really out life in perspective. So it’ll be family/friends first, and then Maldives later for us, once we are tired of family and friends! Haha!"
for now ，maldives is the last thing I will think about this year.its already moving towards june， do you see cases steady arround the globe？ if 1918 provides any experience at all. now is time to prepare for the autumn.I m already starting upgrading security systems around the house. ppl didnt see this coming even after wuhan locked down. who knows what happens in 4 months time. better prepare early
"As LindyLouisa link points out could go either way.May prove to be endemic. May come back with a vengeance in winter and in tandem with Flu cause mayhem. Or it may peter out of its own accord.Not holding out much hope for a vaccine. We've never achieved that in such a short time before, no reason to believe we will now. Let alone the logistics of vaccinating enough of the population. Anti viral or effective treatment on the other hand is a more realistic possibility.Another factor for us is the in-laws wont be best pleased if we go on holiday before going to see them :)"

"""All travellers coming into Britain to be 'quarantined for two weeks' on arrival""This will effectively restrict UK travellers irrespective of what resorts or airlines do until this is lifted unless they don't have a problem going into quarantine for two weeks when they get back.https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/travel…"
"“The best case scenario sees the country reopen borders by May, but the most likely scenario projects a July date for reopening the borders and restarting tourism in October. In the worst case, borders may only open by January 2021”"
"I wouldn't travel for 2 reasons.Travel Insurance in the UK won't cover for the virus. That means that should I fall ill I'd have to pay for my treatment, recovery and airfare return. For a couple this would involve 2 payments. This would scar my future immeasurably.I think I had this virus back in February before it became famous. I could be a carrier and infect others. A test for ordinary folk for antibodies and not infecting others is a long way down the list."
"""Travel Insurance in the UK won't cover for the virus""They cover for plenty of other diseases and mishaps. Malaria, Dengue, terrorism, etc.If you're in a demographic with a high risk of complications and/or travelling to a destination with high levels of transmission, it will of course be difficult to get cover. But tourism is unlikely to open up until risks are lower. At which point actuaries will work their ""magic"" and you'll start to see the risk factored into premiums. I think cancelation cover will be the real problem. Many insurers were already dropping it from policies. After the kicking they've taken this time, I expect many more will drop it. I suspect resorts/airlines will have to change cancelation policies to offer comfort in this area in the absence of insurers offering policy cover.Edited: 3:01 pm, May 09, 2020 "
Not in a high risk demographic.This has always been in policies as not covered for a pandemic. Now they are specifying Covd19.You pay a premium to get covered for terrorism which a lot of people don't check.What will happen to future policys who know's. But they aren't going to drop this until the chances are negligible. So a long time yet. Especially with the extra cost of being flown to the hospital and lack of facilities.Don't get me wrong. I've just sold my lifetime home to a tiny place so I could enjoy more trips. I'm not trying to be negative. Just realistic.
"""This has always been in policies as not covered for a pandemic. Now they are specifying Covd19.""It's been in some policies, not all. I know, because I looked extensively before settling on my policy :) Figured its best to have comprehensive cover if travelling too far flung destinations. Not only because of the punitive cost if something goes wrong, but also because I didn't want to be arguing with the insurer if the worst happened.My Barclays policy has covered me for Pandemic. Both cancelation and medical care. In fact they would even cover me if I went against FO advice (not that I was going to). Only thing they wouldn't cover me for, was cancelation if I made a booking whilst FO advised against travel.Outside high risk demographics the risks aren't actually that high, both in terms of risk of complication and risk of mortality. At least not so high that i'd expect all insurers to shy away from medical cover:https:/…index.htmlAnd that doesn't factor in the probability of you actually contracting COVID-19 in the first place. Clearly the R0 and active infections will have to drop before tourism starts. But once it does, I can't see that it will be impossible to get medical cover unless you're in a high risk demographic. I suspect the bigger issue will be getting pandemic cancelation cover. As the underwriters, will not want another en masse payout for a while. They need to replenish their coffers.Could be wrong ofcourse, but thats my educated guess."
"I'm not familiar with the UK policies (just USA). So far, the policies I've checked (varies by State as well), here in the US would still cover you if you were to get ill/sick, or quarantined (doctor-ordered quarantine) because you contracted COVID.What they won't cover (for the most part, unless you can get a CFAR) is:1) precautionary quarantine.2) government mandated quarantine (ie, you traveled through/to/from XYZ now you gotta self-quarantine for 2 weeks)3) If you miss your flight due to quarantine (ie, you're on an island resort, they close the whole resort for 2-3 days to test everyone and you're ""OK"", sorry you missed your flight, now you have to pay out of pocket for last-minute tickets to get home - costing thousands of dollars).Ugh."
"Personally, I'm not afraid of travel due to health concerns. I would happily take a flight tomorrow and I definitely plan to travel somewhere this summer. However, there are three other issues that need to be solved:a) Health insurance - There needs to be a good insurance policy that would cover emergency treatment for all risks that are reasonably likely. This is hard to obtain at the moment.b) Enjoyment factor - If I travel for leisure, I do it to have a good time. My decission to travel would be largely affected by the (lack of) meassures put in place both in the destination, as well as during the transportation. There's no point travelling somewhere if it's gonna be a miserable experience due to all the restrictions. I do understand we can't go to business as usual yet, but I expect measures taken to be reasonable and not reaching to an extent that would effectively turn the holiday into a nuisance. Furthermore, with more and more airlines introducing a face mask requirement, I'm not willing to travel longhaul as I'm absolutely not gonna wear it for 12+ hours. c) Reliability/trust factor - This is the biggest issue. Even if the restrictions are lifted to a reasonable extent, the situation seems very unstable at the moment and I am very much afraid of another knee-jerk reaction of any government that may have jurisdiction over me during the holiday. I don't wanna end up being stuck somewhere where authorities go into a panic mode, introducing curfews, lockdowns and similar stuff. For this reason, I will only be willing to travel into places where I trust in government's reasonability (this is very much affected by how they handled this crisis) OR to places which are reasonably close to my home, so it's easy to escape on a short notice.To wrap it, I crave travel and I plan to do so very soon. However, I will most likely stick to places within the EU (where I'm covered by my national health insurance) and within the driving distance from my home location (so I don't have to wear a mask for several hours). If I travel longhaul, I will be sticking to places with less severe meassures taken during this pandemic."
its not about ones individual health. its about the wellfare of the ppl close to u ， even you dont mind it yourself due to strong immunity？ or you dont mind strangers well beings. the detrimental effect to the ppl close to you would be so great that stop u from traveling.
"Naturally, this is all up to recieving's country decision. For example, I could legally travel to Sweden and I would love to do so - but I'm staying home, because local government advises against such travel. I respect that, I will not travel where I'm not really welcome at the moment.At the same time, there are other places in Europe that will start welcoming (European) tourists within a few weeks. I will most likely travel to one of those places, knowing that prevailing opinion is that they want people to come.It always takes two. To restore tourism, there needs to be general public that is OK with people coming to their country and there need to be tourists who are OK with travel. This thread is about the letter, but that does not mean that the former is not relevant. It's just not topic of this conversation. We describe what would it take for us to travel again, provided that the destination country decides they want us in.As a final note, risk of spreading various infections has always been there when travelling. Until now we haven't considered that to be a reason to hide in a cave. There are places across the world that rely heavily on tourism - if it is stopped for several years (or even decades), people in these places will face whole lot of problems possibly bigger than Covid-19. I'm not that familiar with Maldivian specifics, but it seems to me that most of resorts are on their own islands. Wouldn't it be possible to create sort of two zones - one ""residential zone"" where strict meassures would apply and a ""resort zone"" where tourists would be able to come more or less freely, with strict rules for crossing from resort to residential zone (e.g. quarantine, health check, etc)? This ways visitors would be able to come without causing concern to locals."
Excellet post THe810 !
"Hi The810Great post and I agree that it takes two to have a successful holiday.One thing I would bring to your attention in case you are not aware is over the last few years local islands have started to embrace tourism and are opening up accommodation for tourists who ether can’t afford the private resort islands or prefer to embrace the more local feel of Maldivian culture.You ask in your post “Wouldn't it be possible to create sort of two zones”. If this was introduced this would be unfair on the local island tourism and may appear to look like one rule for the richer private islands and one rule for the local inhabitants, it is after all their country.I would much prefer that whatever the outcome to this pandemic it is fair to all."
"Mr-Misty47, thanks for poiting that out. I agree it would pose an ethical problem and possibly a political one as well."
"I had a friend from Laos who moved to the west when he was 11. I remember sitting in his house when a news report came on about child labour in Asia and that it was happening in the factories of major western companies.I was surprised he was incredulous that these people were trying to stop kids working in those factories. He said what do you think is going to happen to them and their families. They can't go and sign on. This may seem bad to you because you don't understand the alternative is much much worse for these kids.I suspect the same applies here. In many of these countries, there is no social security net. No chancellor to pay 80% of your wages while you sit at home. Even if you dont work in tourism, somewhere like the Maldives, the end of tourism means hardship all the way down the food chain. So I suspect many people will have his attitude and rather risk COVID than no money, which equals no food/water/shelter."
"Well said. I would just add that no money also means no / worse health care, because that is also dependent on public funding and therefore on how much has been collected in taxes.Edited: 8:11 am, May 14, 2020 "
"That's why framing the debates as the ""economy"" vs. health, or traveling vs. health is absurd.It's about finding the right trade-off, with ""right"" being subjective, and varying according to countries, cultures, personal preference and priorities, etc.."
