I had plans for Japan trip from 26th March -5th April but now due to this corona virus outbreak shou I cancel my Japan trip?
Nobody can tell you whether to cancel your trip- only offer opinions based on their own comfort level and understanding of the risks. Please refer to one of the several existing threads about covid-19 and you will get a sense of what others are thinking. The forum does not need a new thread on this topic.Good luck!
"The coronavirus outbreak in Japan had entered a new phase, spreading among Japanese with the virus not directly came from China. Therefore, we now have to be ready for further increase in the number of infected people. Thus, I cannot say to you that it's safe to come to Japan in March-April. Especially, we should prevent the RAPID increase in the number of infected people in order to keep our hospitals available for patients with severe pneumonia. Thus, the best is to avoid going to crowded places. In addition to cancel Tokyo Marathon for ordinary people and the Emperor's birthday greeting at the Imperial Palace, I want the Japanese Government to close Schools for a few weeks and allow many employers to work at their companies at different times, so the Rush Hours to disappear in major cities. These can help the virus to spread gradually not rapidly."
"Cancelling based on speculation is nonsense. Especially with the current number of cases and the fact that about 80% of quarantined on one single ship.As I've mentioned before in another thread if there aren't even a hundred deaths in a country of 126 million people why would you want to worry?Edited: 12:27 pm, February 17, 2020 "
"CDC of the U.S.A. have announced that they are going to check the coronavirus in influenza patients in the U.S.A. from now. But, I will be surprised if they detect coronavirus in any of the flu-patients in the U.S.A. Contrary, however, the spreading of coronavirus in Japan is, unfortunately, the reality now, not speculation. They are now so many cases of which route of infection are unknown."
"Many Experts in Infectious Diseases in Japan now say that it is ""the Early Stage of Intra-city Spreading of the Virus""."
"Hello,I am booked on a 9 day tour of Osaka to Tokyo end of March 2020. My friend is now in Tokyo and he just informed me many of the public places are shutting down. In lieu of such a situation I hope the Tour Operator will allow me to postpone my trip to another time.Just not enjoyable in situations like this. It is not good memories for Japan."
"Yes, you are right. I just cancelled my flight and hotels :(, The situation is bad right now."
Good for you. There is always another time for you.For me I wish my Tour Operator will cancel.Here’s hoping.
"I have a trip coming up. i would like to know what is likely to be open and what will be closed. At the moment many museums seem to be closed until mid-March. But gardens seem to be open, the castles at Matsumoto and Himeji seem to be open and templesand Imperial Household villas in Kyoto seen to be open. Is that right? What about restaurants in, for example, Takayama or Kyoto?"
No telling what will happen next week.The closure were done at the very last minute by the request of the Government.
"Cullen, Kyōto is still going strong. Heading out to the bars now after a bottle of wine with a friend at the best Italian restaurant here. :) We’re living normally. If I wake up by noon tomorrow , I’ll check out the temples.Edited: 6:11 am, February 29, 2020 "
Serious illness may be less of a worry but the risk of ending up in quarantine for two weeks is too big for me.
Agree. Airlines cancelled.
"Given the incidence and prevalence in other countries, Japan is certainly not the most dangerous country to visit. The OP is from India - while the 62 current cases in India might be a low number on official statistics (at time of writing), it is still an infected country."
"I agree that Japan is nowhere near the top countries experiencing the outbreak right now. The increase in number of cases seems to have slowed down. Some of this may be attributable to various steps the Japanese government have taken to reduce the spread, including closing of popular venues.In comparison, other countries, including the U.S., have seen cases increasing.A bigger question is whether it is a good idea to travel at all during this epidemic. Most of the recent cases in the U.S. started with people traveling back from overseas - on cruise ship, from China, from Italy, and from Egpyt, to name a few. They then spread in the community. The same is true for Japan, the virus came from outside Japan, not from within.My personal view is that people should avoid unnecessary travel to anywhere now until the epidemic is over. That is the only way to stop the spread. We can always make the trip in a few months time. All the research on places to visit will still be valid and not wasted. Japan will still be here and as beautiful.Edited: 8:08 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Yes, I agree with edofva."
"I agree. Everybody, even young and healthy people should consider postponing nonessential travel for now."
Me too. Cancelling my trip to wonderful Japan.
"I have a trip planned in early June and as of now still going. Hard for me and my partner to line up our off days, days off work available, finances etc to cancel it or postpone it."
"Although I agree with the sentiment of all non-essential travel being postponed, this is very difficult in practice when people have put considerable money behind trips (not just those to Japan but trips globally). A lot of people I know are very anxious that they have trips booked and feel like they are FORCED to go because the trips are non-refundable, the flights are still running and travel is still permitted. Unfortunately it's a sign that money makes the world go round; people can't afford to cancel and the travel companies can't afford to let them cancel. It's a sad state of affairs really."
"Although I agree to postpone nonessential travel, if your travel is non-refundable, Japan is not the worst place to come now."
"Hi there,Atm it is non refundable.I have another two weeks to go.Thanks for the update but the way the virus worksno one knows where it is going to hit.Regards"
Also it is not Japan but who on the Air plane may haveC virus?
"Hello,Finally received news from Tour Operator that I can postponed my Tour to Japan until next year.It is a relieve for me.Cheery blossom next year. Regards"
