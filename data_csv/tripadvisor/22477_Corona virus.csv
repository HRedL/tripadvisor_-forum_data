Hi I’ve got a trip planned to Verona on the 6th of March but recently have heard some northern Italy towns are under lockdown due to corona virus does anyone know if Verona has been affected by this? Many thanks
"No case in the whole Verona province by now, just attention level. CiaoFrancesco"
"Up-to-date info, with map here: https:/…"
"That’s extremely helpful, thank you."
Effeti I have placed your link herehttps:/…105712425PW #3 main discussion herehttps:/…105711970
"Effeti,Grazie Mille, very useful"
"Dennis A, are you travelling to Italy soon? You seem to be on every topic posted."
"Thank you that’s helpful, I think we just need to keep an eye on it in case of change thank you again"
"PW #6, later in the year. [booked and hopeful]It just seems to have fallen to me to assemble information. I would like other regulars to pick up some of it but a number seem to have disappeared last couple of days. I was first in Italy in 1968, in the Australian embassy. A country that alters heart and mind... :-)Would be glad if you can chase information too. We have to focus on facts, too many people arriving with unsourced rumours. Too many people writing to local discussions without looking to the national forum, links above. It's a problem of the structure of these forums and the failure of TripAdvisor to put some banners up on their site, in this worrying time. TripAdvisor is in trouble at the moment, they have to be proactive and do better to survive.Edited: 5:02 am, February 25, 2020 "
"No-one is expecting you to Dennis A, especially if you're in Australia and not actually travelling to Italy until the end of year. Travellers will look at other posts on the subject just as I have done, but they will also be looking at other sources of information such as the very helpful link that Effti posted, news on TV, social media etc. Everyone is actually chasing information in their own way, especially me as I'm flying to Verona in 2 weeks time."

"And there's no obligation for you to stay up at all hours in Australia answering and moderating if you feel that it has fallen or landed on you to do so. But thank you anyway. I'm sure that you've helped.Edited: 5:47 am, February 25, 2020 "
"Thanks all - very helpful. We fly into Verona on 05/03 and are driving to Riva for a few days, before a final night in Verona (flying home on 09/03)Latest I've seen is that insurers are not entertaining paying anything out unless the government advise against all travel, so I'm having my holiday :)"
"pw. #11You are new here.Grouchy remarks are not new. I have in the past urged people upset by such to be pleased the negative person was not their mother. And there you were at my 9.30pm telling me to go to bed! :-)You need to understand the nature of advice. I do not retail hearsay. We are in a difficult situation with rumours flying and apprehensions rising. I am concerned to provide properly sourced information with links. I have some experience in such things. While I may these days at 76 be cook and bottle washer for a busy wife when well enough, I have been head of a research service on everything for the Australian parliament, I have had foreign service postings, involving political economic and social issues reporting on several countries, been for time deputy head of the embassy in Washington and ambassador to China. Etc.Etc. Two degrees. In the course of all that, learning to address issues, respect all and treat equally.....and avoid the ad hominem."
Hi I live nearby Verona and so far there are no problems with the infection here. Before coming ensure your country will not force you to quarantine because you are coming back from Italy.
