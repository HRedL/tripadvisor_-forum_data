"Where can I get a Coronavirus test certificate in Vienna city centre (not the Airport) so that I can end quarantine asap after arriving? I will be arriving by train and will be going around Europe before then, so may not be able to get a test before reaching Vienna."
You got answers in the Czech forum where you asked the same quesetion:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g27468…
Not quite the same question as previously he was asking where to get tested in Prague and now he is asking about Vienna.
"and he also asked the same about berlin !anyway, if he is fromthe uk, doesnt he only need a test for his first entry into europe? he wouldnt need a test going from country to country.....at least, that is my reading of the complicated rules."
"Well, if you have made it all the way to Vienna, without getting stopped, then nobody will ask you for a certificate once in Vienna. www.wien.info"
"So to explain further, the test needs to be no more than 4 days old. But in the 4 days before my trip to Vienna I would not be in the UK and would have passed through Berlin and Prague. Also, I can enter Austria but would need to self isolate, until I get my negative test results... That’s why I asked."
There is no mandatory quarantine when entering Austria by land from the Czech Republic or Germany. Nobody will ask you for a negative test.
"Easiest place for a test would probably be Vienna Airport because they have a specialized facility for that. https://www.viennaairport.com/pcrtestMost trains from the West continue to Vienna Airport after a brief stop at Vienna's Hauptbahnhof (Main) Station, making it fairly easy to reach the airport. From other directions you may have to change trains in order to get to the airport. www.oebb.at/en"
"i dont think that mohammad has twigged on to what amainzer said. if he is reaching vienna via berlin and prague, he will have no need for testing in vienna as he is already on the mainland continent!Edited: 7:51 am, July 07, 2020 "
"As I interpret it if you are a resident of the UK you need a test. It maybe that as entering from another country - nobody will check, but that does not mean you legally do not need one.There is a rule for travellers that have spent the previous 14 days in a country that has free access then you also have free access - but only if you are also ordinarily resident in one of the countries allowed in without test or quarantine.This info is from Austrian Government website"
"It doesn't matter where you arrive from, what's relevant is your residency. There are no routine checks on land borders, but that doesn't mean that the law no longer applies. Without a test, UK residents need to self-isolate.Edited: 9:17 am, July 07, 2020 "
"that is not the info that i was officially provided with. there is no way that austrians can ascertain how long you have been in germany etc. you could have an uk passport and had been living in germany for years, and you would not have to self isolate."
"German residents are of course eligible to enter without test/quarantine but as far as I understand, OP is not a German resident."
"""there is no way that austrians can ascertain how long you have been in germany etc.""That is not the point. Austria has a very low rate of infection because it closed the borders and enforced an extremely rigid lockdown., and it does not want anyone from the outside coming to the country and initiating a second wave. A UK resident is required to comply with the law and currently the law requires a 14-day quarantine (even if travelling to Austria via say Holland and Germany). If asked by an authority in Austria (Police, local Health Board or the local Gemeinde) it is up to the person to show that he is complying.  When checking into a hotel or other accommodation in Austria, the travellers details are passed to the local office for payment of the Tourist Tax. Anyone registering and giving a UK address as their usual residence can expect to be contacted by the authorities and asked for proof of a negative test - assuming that the accommodation provider actually allows them to check in at all. The risk for a hotel is that if a guest falls ill and tests positive, then all of the guests and staff will be placed in quarantine until they test negative. The risk for the guest is that if he knowingly failed to produce either a negative test or to self-quarantine as required, he could be faced with a hefty fine from the authorities and a very large legal bill from the hotel and the other guests claiming compensation."
Excellent reply tibandfib. I really want to visit but will not be breaking any rules/laws to do so.
"""Anyone registering and giving a UK address as their usual residence can expect to be contacted by the authorities and asked for proof of a negative test"" - Is this only your theory, or do you know about it actually happening? Because I really don't think this is how it works."
"It depends on the local authority. I can't comment on the larger towns and cities (Vienna, Salzburg etc) but I'm currently in a town and area that is heavily reliant on tourism and which is keen to have some sort of summer season. The local authorities here, both at town (Gemeinde) level and at district (Landes) level have made it very clear that they will be expecting the rules to be enforced, whether these are rules regarding service in restaurants, numbers of people allowed into swimming pools and other attractions - and rules regarding guests from 'Red' countries such as the UK and Sweden. There are so few guests here from these two countries that it will be very easy to contact them and request proof of a negative test - and they have to register with the Gemeinde on arrival, so the authorities know that they are in the town. The last thing that these places want is another outbreak - some villages in Austria were in total lockdown for several weeks in March and April with no travel allowed in or out of the locality and everyone obliged to remain indoors. I know of one family from Sweden who arrived by car without a negative test, but who had arranged in advance to go to the local hospital for tests when they arrived. Until the test results were known they were obliged to stay indoors in isolation and were told that this would be checked. This is an option for anyone from the UK wanting to visit at present - the 14 day quarantine can be ended by having a negative test."
"I absolutely understand the need for rules to be observed and I call upon everyone to do so. However, I can't see how can hotel determine whether the person needs a test or not. No, passport does not mean you are a resident of that country and even if you were, it doesn't mean you're not exempted from the requirement. Furthermore, how would the hotel know you haven't already spent well over 14 days in AT?I just can't see the hotel way of enforcement as practical. Of course, that doesn't mean one can break rules. Getting tested OR quarantined is of course compulsory."
Tibandfib raises an interesting point. Presumably the hotel is obliged to inform the local authority of the details of guests whom they register. It is unlikely they will be accepting guests who have not been pre-booked so details of nationality and country of residence will be known . It is most definitely in their interest not to accept any guest who cannot provide evidence of a negative test or who has not satisfied the current regulations with regard to recent travel and / or isolation. Arriving passengers at airports will be known and can be assumed to be compliant but I would expect most responsible hotel owners will be extremely cautious about arriving guests.
"The hotel is at liberty to refuse to accommodate the guest if they believe that they might put other guests at risk - so the simple thing to do is to ask the guest a) where they have their main residence and where they have come from and b) if necessary, to show the official paper showing that they have had a negative test (this has to be the Official Austrian paper, which can be downloaded and signed by a doctor in the UK). If in doubt, the hotel can refuse to allow the guest to check in. If the guest is allowed to check in, the local authority (Town Hall) will know that they are in the town (they get the info from the hotel check-in paperwork) and they too can ask to see the guest's test result."
"Just to explain the registration system in Austria - when a guest checks into a hotel, the registration form is passed by the hotel to the Town Hall (these days it is all done online) who then collect the relevant Tourist Tax from the hotel and who also collate figures for the Tourist Office - e.g. they can see which countries the guests are coming from and how effective their marketing has been.If the Town Hall (or the local Health Office) want to know how many UK and Swedish guests are currently in town, it would take one or two mouse clicks to extract the information. Likewise, UK and Swedish guests could be flagged by the system within minutes of registering - and the Town Hall could follow up with a hotel visit or require the guest to send a copy of their test certificate."
"My point is you only need to test/quarantine on arrival. It is perfectly possible for UK resident to be in Austria for a month and then check-in to a new hotel. That wouldn't mean they need a new test. There are also some exceptions from the obligation.Knowing one's residency is not enough to determine whether they need to be tested / quarantined at the time.Edited: 1:43 pm, July 07, 2020 "
"Anyone entering Austria from the UK in the last month would have needed a negative test in order to enter and remain legally. If they have been staying in Austria for the last month, they will be able to document this by showing a copy or copies of the registration that they completed at their accommodation or hotels during the month to show where they have been, as in Post 19. The issue still remains - if a hotel has doubts about the guest, they might decide that the risk to their guests, staff and ultimately to their business is too great and refuse to accommodate the guest."
"Actually no, businesses can't refuse service to an EU citizen purely based on their residency (and UK citizens still are EU citizens for most legal purposes). Test / quarantine is required to enter Austria, not to remain there. I can't see hotel finding a way to prove the person entered Austria recently (within last 14 days). And frankly, in current economic situation, I can't imagine hotel wanting to do that.Anyway, it's purely hypothetical debate. OP is outside Austria. They need to test / quarantine, not because someone's gonna chase them, but because it's the law."

"the uk 14 day arrival quarantine finishes on Thursday. Austria will be hopefully ending its quarantine for the uk then .Edited: 3:55 pm, July 07, 2020 "
"I don't think Austria will necessarily reciprocate. They have spoken against some of the EU-wide lifting of travel restrictions as they have imposed some of the strictest lockdown measures from the start, and they are able to derogate from the EU decision to allow people from the UK to enter. I would expect them to wait until infection levels are lower.I'm interested to see that a local hospital will carry out testing. Do you know if this is widespread? We are due to go to Austria next month via Germany by train, and I can't see any way of getting tested in the UK to meet the requirements of the certificate before departure. We'd be willing to be tested locally if at all practical. The nearest hospital would probably be Innsbruck."
"Update from the Austrian Embassy in London in reply to an email enquiry:Dear Mr. xxxx,All travellers coming from the UK must provide a health certificate with a negative COVID-19 test result. This rule has been extended until September 30, 2020.We hope this information is helpful.Kind regardsAustrian Embassy London+44 207 344 325018 Belgrave Mews WestLondon SW1X 8HU ---And from https:/…coronavirus-information""Entry Requirements for UK CitizensNon-essential travel between the UK and Austria is currently strongly discouraged by both the Austrian and the UK government. Whilst we very much look forward to a time when we'll be able to welcome you back as usual, there is currently no specific date set by the Austrian government when this will be the case.If you have to travel (for instance, for medical reasons or for work), you can enter Austria as a UK citizen if:You can produce a health certificate in German or English, which is not older than four days and which confirms that the molecular biological test for SARS-CoV-2 is negative,ORYou agree to a self-monitored 14-day quarantine immediately upon arrival."""
"It would appear timing is everything. In spite of the hotspot amongst ski tourists in Ischgl, Austria reacted fast and effectively. Borders were closed, flights stopped and they have a commendably low level of infections and deaths, better than Germany and amongst the lowest in Europe. By contrast the UK has royally mismanaged the pandemic, and I am very much afraid we will not be welcome visitors for a long time. Who can blame them? Landlocked by countries with active infection all round, they have managed better than we as an island have done."
i will have to cancel summer and winter holidays if this is the case
But surely paying for a Covid Test is cheaper than cancelling your holiday.
its not a simple thing to do in England at the moment is it . and its not really what i want to do with kids in toe on my first day on holiday . it takes the excitement and build up to the holidsy away from you .
"I've looked into getting the certificates sorted but the cost for the whole family is prohibitive. It costs twice as much as our flights. We will be able to change or cancel everything without any financial loss so we will wait till the week before to decide, but the faff of finding private tests and the cost of them just isn't worth it.On the other hand I asked our accommodation whether they knew about any local testing facilities and they replied to say there were no restrictions on us coming. Which is not true but possibly suggests they are going to be flexible on UK tourists!Edited: 1:26 pm, July 09, 2020 "
exactly the same for me . i am going to cancel and try somewhere new . Austria will be waiting for me next year
"you need to put the blame where it should be....in the uk. the reason why there are requirements from austria, and some other countries, is that the uk has one of the highest infection rates in the world, and some countries with low infection rates do not want visitors bringing the virus back into the country....highly understandable. then there is the cost of testing? that has nothing to do with the austrian people....it is the money grabbers in the uk who are intent in cashing in on the virus.if you go to other countries, you can have certain entry requirements, not even connected with the virus. it is always something that you have to be prepared for, and this virus is worldwide, so everywhere is trying to minimise it and its spread. hundreds of thousands....even millions have had holiday plans destroyed, but we do not blame a country for that. it is what it is !"
We are also travelling around Europe so I am following this thread closely. We have overnight train tickets to Innsbruck and we were planning to stay over for one night. As we are now unable does anybody know if we are allowed to still travel to Innsbruck (as our tickets are non-refundable but the hotel is) and then take a train to Italy without leaving the station.
"Transit via Austria is permitted. If you leave Austria at the earliest opportunity, without any undue delays, you are allowed to enter without a test."
Is there any date of when they will be reviewing the entry requirements for those from the UK?
"it is of course under review constantly and depends on how a country can control the spread of the virus. until such a time as the uk can get their spread rate down, i would imagine that the requirement will stay.....and understandably so"
"i am not sure what that has to do with it as your medical records would not be required (afaik) but to be safe, you can of course carry a copy of your wedding cert with you. plenty of people do have such a problem"
Just as the doctor would put my married name on the certificate I would presum
i am certainly not putting any blame on austria....as a certain dubliner implies. just disappointed that for the first time in 10 years i won't be going to austria.
"Fivestars, if you re-read the post, that certain Dubliner puts the blame squarely where it belongs ..... On the UK. Our government has mismanaged the pandemic at every opportunity. Like you, I am beyond disappointed that I can't make my usual visits to Austria this year, and maybe not even next year. All credit to Austria, landlocked and surrounded by countries with higher infection rates, for achieving what we as an island spectacularly failed to do."
"quite right neo ! even though i have the right to visit, i still cannot take the chance, but i might get a chance in a couple of months time ....here's hoping!"
"""Transit via Austria is permitted. If you leave Austria at the earliest opportunity, without any undue delays, you are allowed to enter without a test.""The810, that's interesting for me!Let me throw this at you:I'm planning to drive down to Italy (Sardinia) from Germany, through Austria. (Got DE nationality BTW)I'll be spending just 1 night in Ebbs, arriving late in the day & leaving at the crack the next.Of course I'll have all the vignettes etc. (done this a few times LOL) but are you saying I'll be able to enter, pass through, and leave, all within 24 hours, without ""registering"", ""testing"" or whatever?"
"please read the austrian rules ! if you are resident in germany, there is no need for a test or quarantine."
