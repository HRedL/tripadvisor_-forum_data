Hello allI am travelling to vietnam in april ( specific towards the end of the month) .Anything specific to be concerned of regarding the nCov epidemic ? Will it be safe to travel to Vietnam ?
"> Will it be safe to travel to Vietnam ?Already far too many threads on this subject. Go read them. Long story short: You need to make up you own mind based on the best solid information you can find. Don't listen to people on here who say there's ""No risk"". Nobody knows how this plays out. It's certainly not ""No Risk""."
"I think you would be better asking that question round about march time, who knows what april will bring."
The best advice for you is not going to Viet Nam for this time.
If it does not get any worse in the next few weeks you should be fine. Just keep on checking the news and make a decision.
"No issue of travelling maybe, but as far I knew, you have to present a specific Health Clearance than you are free of the Virus as "" Covid-19 Non-infectious Certificate"" (for skilled workers such as business manager, engineer's, foreign experts etc.) but not as a tourist. On March 17,2020, Office of the State Government issued Notice No. 102/TB-VPCP. visa issuance is halted in 30 days."
"Yep , came to know about the visa suspensions recently . More over India placed under Lockdown , hence cannot travel . Will have to postpone this time ."

My friends booked a motorbike tour in advance and they also have to cancel it. Hope the pandemic will be over in a few months.
Quite dis-heartening . Planned this trip since last year and booked finally only to get this rude shock .
Same the world over....... Always next year.
"Even if some how you can get there now, it won't be fun. My GF told me everything is shut down, even in Saigon: bars, clubs, movies, etc. Streets are pretty deserted and quiet at night now. I told her it's kinda the same here in the US."
"It's slightly better in Saigon, they haven't closed cafes or restaurants yet. Restaurants that have a capacity of 30 or less are still open. Either way, it's pretty quiet. My wife said most people are staying home and only going out to get food from the markets."
