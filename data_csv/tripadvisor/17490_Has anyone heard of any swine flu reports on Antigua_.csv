With all this talk about the swine flu has there been been any reports of this on Antigua. With our trip comming up the end of May we are getting a little nervous about it. Friends of ours just cancled their planned trip to Mexico. I haven't yet heard of any of it in the rest of the caribean. Any help would be great. 
Not to my knowledge. However the travel industry in the UK is talking about cancelling holidays/flights to the USA as it seems to be a real problem there. Hope no one brings it from the US to Antigua!!
As of lasts nights news there are only for states that have reported cases of this and only 59 people. Whereas Mexico City has reached epidemic proportions. they are handing out masks to everyone on the streets. 
"AJ and Scrap, from what I understand the cases in MX are vastly different than the 59 cases in the US. I prefer not be informed but not to obsess on this."
