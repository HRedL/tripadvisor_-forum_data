Again... Do some research and learn the truth... I live here and some of the rumors I've heard are INSANE. Your fear of travel has been created by the media to sell airtime and by Holloywood movies. Those educated and rational thinkers understand the reality of the situation and move forward. MERS IS NOT IN THE GENERAL POPULATION... THERE ARE NO MERS ZOMBIES WALKING AROUND THE CITY! 1. There has not been ONE INFECTION OUTSIDE OF A HOSPITAL since this outbreak began. 2. Those new cases are from family or those exposed in a hospital and then quarantined. They are from the quarantined group and not people out in the streets. 3. The medical ministry is monitoring the quarantined people... This week marks 14 days since exposure from patient zero so the quarantine numbers will reduce. 4. Unless you sleep/live with an infected person your chances of catching MERS by coming to Korea are less than 0.5. MERS is not as contagious as other diseases and is NOT AIRBORNE therefore masks do nothing but make the sellers rich. koreatimesus.com/who-mers-not-spreading-outs…
