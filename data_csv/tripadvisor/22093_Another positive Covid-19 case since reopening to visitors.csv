A passenger on the 7AM ferry between St Thomas and St John yesterday has been confirmed positive for Covid-19 and all passengers on that ferry are asked to immediately contact the Department of Health at 340-774-9000. This has been classified as a community transmission.https://viconsortium.com/vi-health/virgin-is…
"There may be an additional case, a Facebook member self-reported. Also, Sam & Jacks Deli is closed due to contact tracing and testing.Cheer, RickG"
"Well known St John resident that had very minor symptoms, got tested due to upcoming travel. He actually put out the test results on a private resident page which I respected. Am I exposed to him as well as countless people in town. If you are in St John right now act accordingly this is the first case of community spread on the island, assume it’s everywhere!Rick- I think this is the same person.Edited: 11:47 am, June 19, 2020 "
That should read: I am definitely exposed to him as well as my friends and numerous people who work in town. Not am I exposed.....
"What are you calling ""exposed""? Have you shared enclosed spaces without masks while close together? There's different levels of exposure obviously, but that's the level that would concern me personally."
It will be interesting to see if the new cases inform a reintroduction of restrictions and/or travel/lodging bans. Watching closely.......
Governor addressing community today at 1 via Facebook and other local channels and health team will be with him.
I think hospitalizations would drive a renewed ban. So far mild cases.
"A modest rise was fully expected, I would assume. A disease free territory was never possible without completely shutting down the airports and sea ports and complete isolation. The goal everywhere should be to manage the disease at an acceptable level and avoid exponential spikes. It's when 2 cases suddenly become 30, then 400 over a week or two that things get worrisome and drastic measures need to be taken.As long as the local community is taking things seriously and following distancing, no large gatherings, and health guidelines, the exponential spikes should be avoidable."
I think you are right PB. It’s just impossible to manage social distancing in most bars here as I’m sure you could imagine.
****. It’s just impossible to manage social distancing in most bars here*****Easier to just not frequent bars - that is a good social distance!
"tournesolSJ, Does this exposure to you and your friends mean you had contact and you should now quarantine?"
If you have known exposure then quarantine for 14 days should be required...
"I just do beach bar, they are pretty militant on the social distancing. But you walk by other places and it’s just not happening or not possible. Not going into details but yes quarantined and lots of people getting tested...."
"""Not going into details but yes quarantined and lots of people getting tested....""I don't recall seeing or hearing this addressed but do you by any chance know what happens to visitors who are tested and are positive?"
Visitors who test positive are referred to Dept of Health per the diagram on Tourism website.https://www.visitusvi.com/
"Ms411, that I know. What I'm interested in is what happens after that? Are they quarantined here in our hospital facilities even if asymptomatic and for how long? If they don't have medical insurance to cover them while here, who bears the cost? The answers to such questions should be of interest to our visitors and that scenario may not even occur to them as they make plans to travel here far from home."
This was certainly another reason we decided not to travel this summer. Great question which was one I had thought about. If you arrive on STT are tested or present with elevated temperature what then? Go home? Quarantine on island?Stay safe!!!
"Is there a quarantine-in place model or is there an actual quarantine facility for positive cases in the VI?I just read on the VI Department of Health website that anyone exposed is being asked to “Stay home for 14 days and monitor their health”.Are the visitors on the ferry, where the exposure occurred, being allowed to return home if their stay is less than 14 days? Where we live, we where initially quarantined for 14 days after exposure, but this is now generally reserved for positive nasal testing or for actual illness."
If I were planning travel now I would definitely want to know the answers to these questions in order to be prepared for the consequences should I become exposed
"Universal precautions are prudent..treat everyone as if.....be kind, best wishes, STJEdited: 8:17 am, June 20, 2020 "
"I think each positive case will be treated based on the individuals. Since most of the cases here involved residents who quarantined at home, there hasn't been a need to treat or quarantine visitors, but those options are available.Some of the federal stimulus money goes to reimburse hospitals for diagnosis and treatment for uninsured patients. The VI accepted an infected sailor who had been turned away by Puerto Rico. He's being treated at the local hospital, but has been on a ventilator for weeks. Haven't heard any update on that case in a while.Hopefully more people here can be tested, because community spread can't be controlled if we don't know who's spreading the virus."
"That doesn't address the situation which might affect visitors but it's certainly something I plan to ask the Governor and the DOH about after the weekend.The infected sailor is a crewmember from the Philippines who as of a little over a week ago was reported as recovering well but slowly. Since he's obviously been separated from family and friends and not allowed visitors while being treated, the community has been helping taking care of his other than medical needs and keeping in touch with his family."
I have posted the question to the governor's chat group so will post their response.My response referred to visitors. There shouldn't be a one size fits all treatment for visitors because there are too many variables. IMO the Dept of Health should assess each case and present the options that are best for patient and safety of community.
"So the headline is "" Total Covid-19 cases in St John Double in the last week""Not an alarmist I am just commenting how the news media can interpret numbers in a very scary way."
This morning from Dept Of Healthhttps:/…https://www.covid19usvi.com/covid19-report
USVI residents need to start thinking of their islands like an international city now that tourism is reopening. It sounds like social distancing was not taking place for a lot of people due to the low prevalence of COVID during the shutdown. That is over now. Don't fall into the trap of living like a small insular community that the islands may have felt like during the shutdown. Pretend you're now living in NYC and act accordingly. Hopefully everyone is already doing this and it goes without saying. I'm worried about travelers coming in from some states that have decided not to take COVID seriously and their actions recklessly exposing USVI residents.
Mattdad as far as I know it is not the locals who are the problem...they are practicing the CDC protocols it is some tourists who are refusing to wear masks.
"Yeah, I'm worried that's the problem. There's probably no getting through to those people. I hope residents stay as safe as possible! I love this place and all of the people in it!"
"STTres- it’s a great question and I don’t know the answer. But like you said, if I was a tourist I’d definitely like to know! Interesting to note that both St. John cases have spouses that tested negative."
"We are actually very excited for a July vacation in St. John. Visiting our favorite island with very few documented cases of COVID-19 was absolutely one of draws. We also love St. John in the summer time, because the water is so warm and it feels less crowded than high season. In New England two reported new cases of COVID-19 is a reduction in cases, and the trend is celebrated, but I understand that if you are one of those two cases or if this is the first “documented” community transmission, then it is a very big deal. We hope the island remains open to visitors, but we have plans to carry-out only from restaurants, arrange provision, keep space and wear masks for any quick shopping trips and transportation. That formula has helped create the perception of reduced transmission in NH. I can’t wait to wander through St. John without a mask, but to be honest, I feel blessed to be planning an amazing stay-cation in an open air villa with ample beach runs. We hope you all stay healthy and safe."
"@Tour - I have known several people that have tested positive with no family transmission. Most have had little to no symptoms. One had a mild cough. The vast majority of people that test positive have a relatively uneventful course with the disease. A few have serious problems and for a few of those few, it is fatal or very serious.None of the ones I know have had to be hospitalized or worse.It's very contagious, but it's also far from a given that being in the same room with someone with COVID will infect you.We are seeing shorter and less serious courses with the disease here. Of the few that are hospitalized, shorter stays whether a regular bed or needing ICU care. That's encouraging, but it's hard to know why that is happening. Many speculative theories. We've seen a modest, but significant rise in positive tests and hospitalizations, but nothing exponential. Hopefully the exponential growth isn't seen as people continue to maintain some distance and other measures."
"We are just flying home today and will post more later this week. I feel like as visitors we were kind and respectful. We spent a lot of time at our villas and made more meals at the villa then we normally would. We had masks wherever we went.I will say depending on the establishment depended on their enforcement of social distancing Skinny Legs, Morgan’s Mango and Beach Bar stood out to me as places that really enforced social distancing which made us feel great about being there.I will say that I think there are some tourists but also locals not taking it seriously. We were grabbing lunch one afternoon late and there was a large group of locals over 10 together at a bar all on top of each other drinking and complaining about visitors with no masks. most visitors I saw had masks.However, there were a few that acted entitled to not have to wear one. We were at Skinny legs one night and they were only letting one guest at a time who was waiting for a table (about an hour wait) go get drinks from the bar and rejoin your group only if you had a mask.We had been waiting about a half hour when a very entitled group came in the staff told them one person at a time and had to wear a mask. They kept disregarding the rule it was just while ordering drinks at the bar and one customer told him he would not put on a mask and they refused to serve him. The staff handled it perfectly. He got mad and his whole party left. The many other tourist who did follow were the rules had no issues.The ferries were not enforcing the masks. American Airlines on way down made you have a mask to bird but don’t feel like they regulated the masks on the way back they required it and checked all guests had masks on before we took off. They said if you refused to wear a mask they would not allow you to fly on future American flights. Everyone around us had their masks the whole time!"
"At the last Government House update (which can be seen on the Government House, US Virgin Islands Facebook page) a reporter asked the question to the DOH officials, What level of community transmission would alarm you, and the reply was any community transmission is cause for alarm. And they said that was basically why they were holding the briefing in the first place since there are two territory-wide in the last week or so. (This happened in the last minute or so of the briefing if you want to hear it for yourself). A friend posted a very brief video of the airport waiting area a couple of days ago and it looked like about 1/2 of the people waiting were wearing masks that covered their nose and mouth if they had one at all. Masks need to be worn at all times (covering your mouth and nose) when you are out unless you are seated. If you are at the beach or on a trail you need to have your mask quick at hand so you can cover your mouth and nose while you pass other people. In town you should wear them while you are walking around. As most of you know, we have limited walking space and you are frequently within 6 feet of other people even if it's only briefly. I understand that the recovery rate is very high for COVID. I also understand that here, especially on STJ, we have extremely limited resources and it wouldn't take much to have our system overwhelmed. I have friends that were tested just a couple of days ago at the clinic on STJ and they all had to wait for swabs to be sent over from STT to even get the tests done. As wonderful as our healthcare professionals are here, you are going to have to trust me, you do NOT want to be hospitalized here. I suggest provisioning services for groceries. If you can't do that, I suggest you have a designated shopper. One person who does the shopping in the markets and drug store. Same person every time. The locals can avoid bars, restaurants, and retail shops. But we have a harder time keeping away from essential places like grocery stores and pharmacies. The less crowed those places are for us the better. I for one appreciate all of the precautions and the extra care you are all taking to keep our community safe. Thank you!If you or anyone in your party is feeling ill while they are here, even if the symptoms are very mild, please self-quarantine and call 340-776-1519"
Just saw on FB that Longboard is closing for a few days due to potential exposure concerns. I assume this is tied to the same cases referenced here. Anyone know if this is being done at multiple restaurants in the area?
Just Sam and Jacks and Longboards I think at this point. Lots of people waiting on test results right now...
When are results expected?
"Some good news this morning. The Virgin Island Department of Health on Facebook is posting 28 negative covid tests between 7/22-7/23 with only 2 pending. Let’s hope those last two tests and all involved stay healthy.Edited: 7:39 am, June 24, 2020 "
"@Alex - That's very good news.There was a great article in the WSJ summarizing what we think we've learned about transmission of the virus and written at the lay level. For those with a sub, it is here: https:/…The quick and dirty: Aerosolization appears to be the biggest culprit by far. Fomite transmission (touching a contaminated surface) appears to play a very minor role and it likely requires you to get that contamination to your face for aerosolization into your lungs. And, the amount of virus left on a surface has to be significant for it be viable. Just because it's detectable on a surface doesn't mean it's viable and after that there are several steps required to infect someone.Crowds are bad. Indoor crowds are worse. Keep your distance in general. (I personally believe this is THE most import point in avoiding rapid, exponential spread.Infection probably requires a decent sized viral load. You can think of that as amount of viral exposure x length of exposure to the aerosol."
Those figures didn't include the breaking news this morning when those two pending tests proved positive:https://viconsortium.com/vi-coronavirus/virg…
"Thank you STT resident. Can you confirming those two pending tests for STJ from the health dept website were positive? I read the article on VIconsortium attached to your post and other than the headline which states that there are two new cases in St Croix, I wasn’t able to get more details about possible two new cases in St. John this week."
The positive tests reported today 6/24 were both on St Croix -- the STJ surge in testing is reported here.newsofstjohn.com
"Alex A, localsailor answered the question but of course the point is that we simply don't know what's going to happen as visitors continue to come into the territory in greater numbers every day and the fact that we now have at least a few cases of community transmission and some bars have already been closed. An increase in numbers was absolutely anticipated but it's the constant uncertainty of that impact and the potential severity of cases that has most of us who live here a bit on tenterhooks. The majority of visitors so far understand the situation and are being compliant where wearing masks, etc. is concerned but there have been several incidents on all three main islands of some not complying and becoming very irritated/belligerent when politely approached."
"""But 42 negative tests and zero positive tests this week is a very positive sign..."" It is a very good sign. But with this virus you can test negative on a Monday and positive on Wednesday which calls into question getting a false sense of security from good outcomes."
Two more positive contact transmission cases on St Croix confirmed Wednesday night.
"One more ""travel-related"" case on St Thomas being tracked as of Thursday evening."
"To me, when they say travel related, I assume it is the person who tested positive that traveled. If it is from a visitor (i.e. tourist) I would think it would say ""community spread""."
Travel related is used when the person who is positive has recently traveled outside their community. Community spread is the designation given to someone who tests positive who has not traveled outside their community. The CDC clarifies that community spread means the spread of an illness for which the source of infection is unknown. The term is used when officials cannot determine how a person contracted the virus.
Out of the two cases one is a villa owner who came to the island and was positive so travel related. He didn’t acquire the virus on the island assumably. The other is a resident who had not travelled and got the virus from the community. Hopefully from the first guy ha.
"As expected, the numbers are ticking up. It was reported last night three more positive cases on St Thomas. For anyone who is interested, you can sign up for updates to be texted to you. You can do that on the Department of Heath is Virgin Islands webpage and Facebook page. One thing I wanted to note is that I know several people on St John who have been tested recently and those numbers are not showing up in the reported ‘pending’ cases. Test results take about 48 hours. I have a friend who was tested Sunday and the results are not in yet. And that isn’t showing as a ‘pending’ case for St John."
"Believe those last 3 were actually on St. Croix per the VIDOH site and lists that VI has 4 tests pending results, all on St. Thomas.For all VI Since mid May (14 days after relaxing restrictions):0 deaths15 testing positive (1 every 3 days)And if I understood the Gov. correctly, only 3 in hospitals (included the sailor) and all doing well considering.This all seems improved news from the dark days of a couple months ago."
"I can't see anything of ""improved news"" when we've only just reopened to visitors from all over the country (most coming through Florida which is seeing record spikes) and now have community transfer."
"Rollin, you are correct. The new three are st Croix. My apologies. I guess the point I was trying to make is that I know for sure that there are issues with the reported numbers since I know a St John resident waiting for results from being tested at Myra Keating on Sunday yet the numbers don’t reflect that."
Five more new cases on STX reported 6/30 after STJ*Julie posted .
I noticed on the latest report that NEGATIVE cases on STJ went up 12. Yet we always had a pending number of 0. Test results are taking 48 hours at this point.
"And one new case on STT. Puerto Rico is now mandating that as of July 15th, all incoming visitors show proof of negative testing within 72 hours of departure from the mainland. No test or positive test, enforced quarantine for 14 days. I wonder if this will also apply to travelers deplaning in PR and then taking a separate flight to STT."
STT- I was wondering the same thing? We transfer through PR but it’s before the 15th. We land tomorrow and spend the night at the airport hotel and then onto STT Friday. We are staying in STJ until 7/13 and then transfer through PR to head home to NH. Our layover home is a mere 55 minutes. I know we miss the new protocol but I’m curious if they will step it up prior to 7/15.
Good thing I decided to read this! We just booked yesterday for August 1. We have a brief layover in PR. Luckily I had a routine dr appt yesterday and they have the 24 hour test available. Does anyone know if it’s 72 hours from date of test or date of results?
"So if we are flying into STT on July 24th, and then continuing to STJ, we have to have a Covid test within 72 hours of leaving the US?"
"@Deborah - The COVID testing rule being discussed applies to Puerto Rico, not STT or the USVI. But, this is ever changing and rapidly, so stay tuned.@NY - It almost certainly applies to when the testing sample was taken, not results received. And, that makes it pretty challenging based on results not being consistently returned in a timely manner. I also wonder if it has to be a PCR swab test or can it be antibodies? The antibody test is far less useful for truly screening for the virus due to several factors, but most of them are much quicker in terms of receiving results. Usually within hours."
Current details here:https://viconsortium.com/vi-travel/virgin-is…
"Parkiebear, it cannot be antibody test. I just read that it has to be molecular nasal swab. Luckily my dr does the 24 hour test but they said to allow 48 hours. So I guess we have to get tested on a Wednesday for Saturday arrival. Link to article :https:/…amp"
"The article doesn't specify whether the test is necessary if you are merely transiting through PR's airport and do not leave the airport, or the specific details of quarantine. It sounds like a test would be required to leave the airport however.From STT's Link:Starting July 15, all passengers have to wear a mask and must take a molecular test 72 hours prior to their arrival and submit the results to officials at the airport. Those who refuse to do so, or tested positive, or do not have the test results available, will be forced into a two-week quarantine. During that time, they have to undergo a molecular test and share the results if they want to be released from quarantine, said Puerto Rico Health Secretary Lorenzo González.“If you don’t want to be tested, stay home. Don’t come here and complicate our situation,” he said.Most molecular tests involve a nose or throat swab and are used to diagnose an active infection. Puerto Rico’s government will not accept any other test, including antibody ones that require a finger stick or blood drawn."
"They also say in that article that they won't be tracking every person and as long as you respond to phone calls you won't be fined. We are supposed to fly to San Juan on 7/11 and on to STX 7/13 for a week so following this very closely. We don't have a problem getting tested if we can get in to a testing facility and get the results back in time, though I think this measure is pretty silly seeing as I could go out to dinner or any other activity right after getting tested."
