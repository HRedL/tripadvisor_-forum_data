Is it necessary to take anti malaria pills when visting anantara
Yes.
"Will I need to take anti malaria tablets to visit Bazaruto beach area, southern Mozambique for 5 days in August?"
"You really should ask a doctor, and not people's opinions in a forum. But yes, you should definitely take malaria meds when in Inhambane Province, it is a epidemic area"
I got cerebral malaria after a holiday in Morrungulo which is near Massinga. Take medication; mosquito repellent; long sleeved shirt at night; burn mozzie coils; etc. I was very lucky as cerebral malaria has a 94% fatality rate. Enjoy -its beautiful there.
Thanks for your post. You have helped re in force for me the decision to do full malaria prevention measures. Sounds like you had a rough time following your holiday. Glad to hear you are ok. It looks such a beautiful place I think we have to go for it.
"please take antimalaria medication, Mozambique is a high risk zone. Maybe only Ponta do Ouro is a little bit safe"
