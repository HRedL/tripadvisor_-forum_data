Hopefully visiting Venice on March 10th.Is there a site where I can check which towns are on lock down.Helen
Recent discussion https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g18…
Thanks. I'll keep an eye on that post.
Dennis A that’s helpful. I’ve noted the thread to check back on for my trip at the end of March
Make a note of any official site in there that is identifying closed towns and that you can check later. Within past hour or so I heard from someone in town between Venice & Padua who was concerned her town was about to be added to list.
https:/…this is a link to a map with the lock down towns in Italy at the moment.
This article is companion to the map to which Helen has posted a link. It sets out the closures and travel restrictions etc. Open in Chrome for translation https://www.corriere.it/cronache/20_febbraio…
"That map is already out of date, more cases were reported overnight and things are moving rapidly. Universities, schools, public offices, restaurants, bars ... are all closing down in the impacted areas and there are now reports that the Venice carne al will be cancelled.The La Republica website is proving real-time updates by the hour:https:/…Edited: 8:21 am, February 23, 2020 "
"In the Veneto Region, the ONLY town currently subject to quarantine is Vo Euganeo, which I very much doubt any tourist is planning to visit.https://www.corriere.it/cronache/20_febbraio…Carnevale in Venice is being cancelled, but otherwise the city remains fully open to business."
Following...we're scheduled to visit in late March. Wishing everyone good health
"We are due to visit on 13th March. Having serious reservations about the trip, particularly as there are 2 cases confirmed in the city.Will be watching this thread closely."
"sadly prospects are no looking good, Venice seems to be suffering lack of tourists anyway before this. With the overreaction it is not looking good for next week.https://www.ilgazzettino.it/nordest/venezia/…"
"I have just received this in an email from Campaign for a living Venice via Voce di Venezia about the situation in Venice at the moment. I feel so very sorry for the citizens of Venice, they have had a hard time since November. Given the global concerns over the Coronavirus it seems like an unavoidable reaction to the appearance of the virus in the Veneto.Events already in progress will go until completion to avoid problems of public order. After today’s last event clears out, there will be a total absence of public events, including holidays, of any form of gathering, public or private, through March 1. This measure may eventually be repeated.Schools of all grades and levels are closed until March 1. Also closed will be museums, cinemas and any other place of public or private gathering. Markets will be closed, and group activities for recreation, sports, social or any other reason are all suspended.All public transportation will be disinfected, including Trenitalia and water transport.At the moment there is no news about “patient zero”. Moreover we have two patients recovering in the historic city of Venice that concern us a good deal because they have no clinical history related to the Chinese community or to people who come from infected zones. We are therefore checking on the people who saw the couple most often.With this ordinance we ask for the understanding and the cooperation of all citizens. This is not an easy moment, however, with the information we have today we can still hope to contain the infection. As of today there are 25 cases in Veneto.The ordinance takes effect immediately; I believe it will be in full force by midnight tonight.”Source: La Voce di Venezia"

"Not sure that people are aware of this but the virus has a rather long incubation period, during which time infected people can feel well enough to travel around on public transport or join with others small spaces, and infect them in the process. This has been going on for more than 2 weeks in Italy -- infected people unaware they should be avoiding contact with others going about their business, many of them outside the towns where the infections have now boomed into many cases.So it is not enough to avoid visiting the towns where the infection has bloomed and have therefore been put under isolation. If you are going to travel at all you need to know how to protect yourself from coming into contact with the virus wherever you go. Wearing gloves, washing your hands, not sharing food (I would definitely skip plates of common food at a bar), avoiding closeness to strangers (on public transports, in restaurants, religious services, alleyways and shops), not using toilets where there is no seat you can lower when you need to flush -- there is now plenty of quality advice on the internet. You might decide you don't want to travel, and you do run the risk that if the virus blooms in somewhere you are visiting, you might find yourself quarantined, either in place or when you attempt to return to your home country."
"so in some ways the worst possible news, possible 5 days in Venice with virtually nothing open and probably unable to cancel without losing all the money,"
https:/…
"La Repubblica reports that the Roman Catholic Patriarch (Archbishop) of Venice has announced that all Holy Masses in Venice and in areas near Venice under his jurisdiction will be stopped, effective immediately, through at least March 1st. The Catholic faithful are encouraged to participate in Holy Services by watching the Mass on television, listening on radio, or by meditation and prayer at home. Catholics affected by this decree will be dispensed with the obligation to go to Mass on Sundays and on other religious holydays, including Ash Wednesday."
What does this mean? All social gatherings banned in Veneto region? So that's it then no holidays in Venice until atleast 1 of March? I'm booked for 27th this month.
Oh dear - we are due to travel to Venice this Tuesday - watching and waiting
I'm due back end of March. Just plugging in for updatesThanksx
"We will be in Venice and Milan March 7-13. At this time, I see the WHO does not have any travel restrictions for northern Italy. 2 people have died, but there must be 500,000 people in the area. Also.... older people with weaken immune systems who then come in contact are far more likely to become very sick. Does anyone know if these cases are in the ‘suburbs’ or smack in the tourist areas?"
"All 11 towns subject to quarantine in northern Italy are OUTSIDE of tourist areas. Nevertheless, churches and museums will shutter in Lombardy, as will churches in Veneto. That affects tourists who were planning to visit churches or museums in those regions. Restaurants and food markets remain open.At the moment, the risk of getting caught in a quarantine area is extremely, extremely low."
"Someone linked an article below which stated that markets, museums, cinemas, schools etc will be closed, social and recreational gatherings banned until March 1st in the whole Veneto region commencing midnight tonight."
"Until it's announced officially, take everything you read online and in here with a pinch of salt.We're visiting mid-March and will do all we can to make sure we can still get across."
News today (Sunday) that Carnivale is being curtailed because of problems with the spread of Coronavirus in Venice and the Veneto - now one of the hotspots of Europe apparently
Shops and supermarkets are open. It is open air markets that are closing. Now it is until march 1st ..public transport and trains are being disenfected apparently. Yes Venice is going to suffer again however if these measures are worthwhile then so be it !!
"I feel the same we are due to visit next Monday 2nd march, don't know what to do for the best"
"just two points of clarification: Along with the virus prevention methods mentioned above, seriously consider wear an appropriate mask. They are now sure that the spread of the virus thru the quarantined cruise ship was by air, probably through the ventilation system. MY exchange student daughter sent me photos from Nanjing China, where her parents can only leave their apartment once every three days and not together. They are both high tech scientists and are wearing n95 masks she had to send then from DC because they had runout of them in China and are also wearing respirators. Second- there are two ways that viruses kill people, the first mentioned about is that it wears out the organs of the old or infirmed leading to failure. The other way is that younger people have immune systems that overreact to the virus and destroy the healthy cardiac, kidney or pulmonary systems. That is why the Spanish Flu of WWI went through military camps of young healthy soldiers in the US rapidly with a high death rate in only hours between onset and death.This virus can hit both the young and old hard, or it can be nothing at all for some people. Nobody knows which they will be so care is really important. Just the other day we had a young healthy girl in Philly die from just the normal flu virus. The coronavirus spreading now seems to have a big effect on the lungs causing pneumonia. Try to be as cautious as possible and most people will be unaffected and safe."
Invaluable news and advice in this thread. Elsewhere I have recommended that people keep abreast of developments by checking the major newspaper Corriere della Sera. https://www.corriere.it/https:/…105683305
I am sorry but i would NOT rely on the media at all but on sites such as FCO or WHO . Also consult your medical specialist before travelling if you are concerned
"Thanks Rosa, for the reality check about this - some of the hyperbole is really unfortunate.I hope for your sake and all who live in Venice, that these precautions don't disrupt your daily lives too much and for too long."
We are due to leave this coming wednesday :-( will just keep watching the news......
"Re #28 Am not challenging you, but do you have authority for that determination that on that cruise ship transmission was through air/ventilation system? I recall ""experts"" throughout that crisis claiming could not happen that way. If true, that seems like would be real game changer, making air travel, stays in modern hotels, visits to modern office buildings etc far far more dangerous than previously thought."
there is speculation on many modes of transmission...air vents etc. on ship is one...nothing confirmed by experts. Whatever that ship was not a safe place for the passengers and many more got the virus because they had to stay on board.
"Regarding the value of wearing masks, their is little evidence the kind of masks you can easily buy are effective in preventing airborn viral diseases. To work they have to be a certain kind and they have to fit perfectly, ie, no airleaks. That excludes any man with a beard. That ""fit"" on the face is quite uncomfortable and too claustrophic for many people.The kind of mask that you see most people wearing: a typical surgical mask loosly tied onto the face, are useless. There have been many articles recently about the effectiveness of wearing a face mask: you can google it and read for yourself. The take home I got from reading one of those articles a week ago was that wearing gloves and frequent hand washing if you are not wearing gloves are much more effective than a mask.Edited: 5:48 pm, February 23, 2020 "
Its all a bit scary. Our local news advising of cancellation of so many services and events in Venice and indeed greater Italy https://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/travel-troubl…
Even wearing gloves will not protect you if you touch your face (with gloves on) after having touched an infected door knob or flat surface. You need to clean the gloves with chlorine wipes (as you would your bare hands).
"#28 please check your facts. The mortality rate from Spanish flu was so terribly high due to secondary infection by pneumonia-causing bacteria. https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-release…In the days before antibiotics, bacterial infections such as this were often deadly."
We are meant to be travelling on the 3rd of March..This thread makes very scary reading.. Have UK put a travel ban in place yet?
https:/…coronavirusIt seems there aren't any travel bans yet but they confirmed a lot of things closing for the week. I wish there was more information out so people would know what to expect. So far my take is not to go
We are a set to travel on 25TH.ill be contacting travel insurance tomorrow.
I will contact them too. I doubt they will help unless there is an official UK warning in place. All we can do is watch development day by day.
"I’d be interested in knowing if your insurance company will reimburse you. If you are like me, you might have already booked and paid for a few tours. Praying that this virus is stopped very soon and things return to normal in Venice!"
"unless you have ""cancel for any reason"" insurance most have found their insurance does not cover epidemics."
"i am due to travel to venice tomorrow 02/25, too scared to get stuck there if the city goes on lock-down, they wont let us go. re-arranged my trip and am staying away from there. good luck"
QQ@ (Post 33) Maybe the actual incubation period is longer than first thought? This would be consistent with surface and close range body fluid exchange rather than the air con system as a source of transmission.
The point of the mask isn't to protect you but to protect others. If you're already infected but not showing symptoms the mask will hopefully stop you sharing.
"#46 I read somewhere this weekend that there is belief incubation period may be longer than originally thought. However, I can't remember where I read that or what basis for it was.Maybe it was connected to current case in Italy. I believe they originally thought patient #1 in Italy may have been infected when he had a meal with work colleague who lives in China. However, that meal took place at least a month ago (3 weeks before patient #1 became ill) and the person in China never became sick and tests negative for the virus, so they ruled him out. But maybe there is another school of thought that you can catch virus from someone who is not only asymptomatic but shows no signs of having or ever having virus PLUS incubation can be more than 14 days."
"If you've never had the virus you can't pass it on.They've known the incubation period is longer than fourteen days for awhile. Not everybody develops symptoms or if they do gets seriously ill. That's part of the problem the parents of the child with pneumonia both tested positive but had no symptoms at all. OTOH the child who has pneumonia doesn't have the virus.Edited: 11:41 pm, February 23, 2020 "
"Stopping a train at an Alpine border crossing into Austria coming from Venice, due to 2 suspected cases? It looks like optics for benefit of calming everyone, sure the number of cars and buses crossing borders outweighs this ""check"""
I thought the Austrian train stopped was coming from Austria?Either way a train has hundreds of people that you risk having to quarantine all if there is one case on the train. Worse that train likely stops at places on the route with people jumping on and off. It's a pretty quick way to spread things over a wide area.
Hi just see. Your post I’m booked to go on 28th Feb
#51. Two people on one train feeling unwell were checked and cleared. Trains resumed hours ago.
The updated Irish DFA website is 'advising' people not to travel to affected areas.
Really? nothing from UK at all
www.comune.venezia.it
We heard that all museums are closed in Venice. We even had our city pass refunded. Working with the travel agent in Italy (Tomorrow Travel) to reroute us to Florence by skipping Venice altogether. American travel agent (Great Value Vacations) was useless in this situation and even told me that I call too much.
we due to fly today....no idea what to do...
saw other couple due to go on 2/25. What is your decision?
What we're afraid of is getting stuck up there even if we are not infected. Situation is changing rapidly and I think we're not told everything. Just spoke with Department of State and lady told me that it's possible to get quarantined there although I felt like she was relaying a generic message. She advised me to check with Airlines and State website. Travel advisory for Italy was not updated since 1/15/2020.
@ndmy- what have you decided to do?We fly on the 5/03.
Still in limbo. We suppose to flight out tonight. Haven't heard from travel agent yet as far as skipping Venice portion of the trip.
"So far I haven't contributed to this discussion. I'm due to fly out Sunday (1st March) and stay a week, all organized independently and nothing covered by insurance. Right now, I'm inclined to cancel (5th death reported from the affected area just now). Not so much because I'm overly terrified by the virus - judging by the speed with which it travels round the world it won't be long before it appears on my own doorstep - , but by the measures already taken or planned by the authorities that will seriously impede my stay in Venice.And if by any chance quarantine comes into effect I'd rather not sit that out in a place in a foreign country whose language I unfortunately don't speak.It's a pity really, but compared to what people in the affected areas in China suffer (reports of food shortages leaked out) ours are ""luxury problems"".So, all the very best to travellers and non-travellers, Alepou."
"I have a Delta/Air France flight for March 3 to Venice. I just called Delta, and they are showing reluctance to change it, saying they are still flying into Milan and Venice until there is a travel ban from the state department. At this second, I am thinking of avoiding Venice altogether. Both my friend and I have elderly parents 78+, two with renal failure, diabetes, and heart issues who we care for regularly (I take my mom weekly to group dialysis center full of other patients with similar health conditions) and my friend has 3 kids. I am going to lose lots but don’t want to compromise people’s health and possibly be quarantined which we can’t afford to do given our responsibilities. I am still waiting and hoping that Delta, United, EasyJet, and RyanAir will waive change/cancellation fees. I have so many tickets I purchased for this trip. I may decide to try to go elsewhere like Croatia. Even they have home quarantined students who they pulled out from a school trip in Venice this weekend. This is a really a scary situation.Edited: 8:32 am, February 24, 2020 "
"B LYou are about a week out and unless there is an advantage now to cancelling your reservations and losing money or holding tight for a few days to see where this is going, I would try to be patient and wait until the last possible moment to cancel. A LOT can happen in a week or even days with this virus and I always assume airlines etc will act reasonably when in this or a similar situation. My advice is to wait before cancelling in case there is a dramatic change in the outbreak that prompts the State Dept/Airlines from flying into/out of Italy. That would warrant a refund or at least a trip credit. If you cancel now you would more than likely get nothing."
"B LI meant to add that given your situation, I would unequivocally cancel. Italy will always be there but the risk to travel there now is too great especially for your family who are immune compromised."
@64 booked on Delta....I would wait...given the history of this virus and most governments wanting to be pro-active I think US may put on a more severe warning....which will make it better to cancel. Another tactic that always works for me after calling Delta is to (1) make sure you have an interested and more senior person on the line that can make decisions..takes a bit of practice but I often call back a few times (2) be prepared with plan B and to rebook...ie they are not refunding but changing and often waive the fees due to the circumstances but there may be additional fare or even refund depending. As for all your other tickets well that will take the same efforts although doubtful you would want anything there but refund. Good luck...I think Italy and especially Venice will take another hit on this one. It does not sound like a good time to be there at all.
"@ Maresc46 Thank you... you are right... Italy will always be there. I am so sad, since I have been planning this trip since November, and it was suppose to be a girlfriends getaway trip with my friend who has never been and who rarely travels without her kids. Although I have been to Italy a few times, it’s been a long long time since my last visit especially Venice. I was so excited. But yes, heath is more important than money lost. Really hoping that this can be controlled sooner than later for everyone’s sake. Hoping that they will have that vaccine."
@Gene Thank you for the tip. Will be waiting a few more days and talk to my friend for a possible plan B. And hope that eventually I can work something out with at least a few of the airlines.
"At present the number of towns on lockdown remain at 12, see attached map on BBC website.The Guardian have been running a live blog for several weeks so you can always find the latest information on their website.We are due to go to Venice on 21st March we will just keep an eye on the situation over the next 2 -3 weeks and decide nearer the time if we should travel or not.https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardi…https:/…world-europe-51602007"
"Hi, could you keep me posted on your trip? I’m scheduled to leave for Venice this Friday (the 28th.) Hoping both our trips will still go well!"
"Just found this message regarding the Basilica of St. Mark:patriarcatovenezia.it/site/…Didn't find an English text, but the gist of it is that St. Mark's will remain closed for tourists, no mass will be celebrated, and only the faithful can enter to pray."
"Another useful link (in German though) about what is shut down or cancelled:…blogspot.com/2020/02/242-132020-venice-shut…By clicking into each row you'll find the appropriate information, often in English as well."
My concern is getting quarantined.
"To Rosa'a point- on Sunday NPR used a BBC report to say that Venice had cancelled the rest of the Carnivale. But no mention that with that came closing of almost all other public events and buildings. Most of the major networks (NBC, ABC, CBS) said even less. At the moment the US media is focused on the political race and those stuck on cruise ships."
We have an early June flight from Rome to Israel. Israel is now introducing flight restrictions from Italy. I wonder if this is still in effect in June if El Al will refund tickets?
We are supposed to leave for 3 days in Venice tomorrow. Does anyone know if restaurants and shops open as normal?
"Re #60 That comment on US State Dept website is incorrect. Most recent advisory was issued January, but most recent alert, a health alert concerning the coronavirus situation, was issued Sunday, Feb 23. You can find it on the State Dept country info page for Italy or the US Embassy Rome homepage."
Andrew P from West Chester - Now that you are back would you kindly provide authority for statement you made in # 28 to effect it has been determined coronavirus transmission is thru air and ventilation systems? Who determined it and when and where was that finding published?
"@DinoSharan yes, so far, the shops and restaurants are open as Venice is not a source of coronavirus outbreak but nearby Vo’ Euganeo is. Vo’, however, is completely blocked by police and military and people can not go in or out, while medical crew is performing virus tests on locals each day.I will be travelling to Venice on March 3rd to catch a flight to Marrakech and so far have no plans to cancel my trip.Edited: 1:59 pm, February 24, 2020 "
@Granitepeaker. I think it’s a bit too early to be contemplating what the situation will be come early June. Let’s just hope the situation is fully contained as soon as possible.
"Please could you check / share on this post.I’ve been noting useful links on this as we’ll be travelling to Venice at the end of March. There are lots, in various languages and media or more official.If you visit and can share what you found that would be appreciated. If you are concerned so are others as the number of post shows"
Someone posted that museums were shut and their Venezia Unica card had been refunded. There is a note on the front page of the MUVE (Civic Museums including the Doges Palace) that they will be closed to the public until 1 March. I’m on a train so haven’t been able to find any detail
GreSams89 thanks for that info -we are only in Venice do 3 days staying in centre so just wanted to double check restaurants etc. All open
"I have placed here information on government restrictions related to the virus. Across the north of Italy no schools, no gatherings, no festivals etc. https:/…105702046It would be helpful if someone at TripAdvisor could wake to the fact that people are constantly adding new discussion threads about the virus in locality forums. When participants are inside local forums they do not see all discussion as in the Italy forum."
"At 2045 an update was posted on the Council website. I can only find it in Italian but it seems to say the same as Dennis A posted - special measures are being introduced - banning of large gatherings, schools and museums are closed until 1 March. https://www.comune.venezia.it/it/content/cor…Health has to be the primary concern"
"Constant adding new threads on the same subject, flooding, getting from MP airport etc really gets on my nerves."

"Hey NDMY, any decisions yet?I’m scheduled to fly out Thursday and spend one day in Venice before heading south. Trying to figure out if we should cancel the hotel in Venice for the night and go straight to Florence. I’m not worried about getting sick, just about being quarantined for the entire trip!"
"#90: because the museums and churches are closed in Venice, what are you planning to do there for one day? Perhaps just walk around and admire the gorgeous architecture and lovely palazzi along the Grand Canal? Maybe it makes sense to add the day to Florence, unless you are going to be forfeiting a lot of money?I would really discount the risk of getting quarantined."
We have arranged to skip Venice and go to Florence. Will be going directly to catch the train from Venice airport.
"FWIW, I’m in Rome now with my husband and three children. We were supposed to travel to Venice I’m 2 days, and then to Milan. We decided to stay in Rome. Got partial refunds on lodging. Am hoping for some refund for Frecciarosa trains we already purchased but not counting on it. Not sure if it was an overreaction to change, but we didn’t want to take the chance of bringing the virus home to our family and community.We were supposed to fly from Milan to NYC, and Delta changed us to Rome-NYC at no cost."
"That was nice of Delta to do that. So far I haven't seen any waiver policies posted by any of the major US carriers (except for Asia), though wouldn't be surprised to see that. In the meantime, it's good to know they are being decent on a case by case basis."
"I know this is Italy, but there have been river cruises mentioned in the thread. We are also using Globus for another trip and they have just cancelled all cruises, land tours etc to China. In addition their river cruise company Avalon is not allowing anyone to board who has been to or travelled through China, Macaw, or Hong Kong in the last 21 days. I applaud Globus."

NDMY-safe travels! We have until the 26th to cancel our hotel so hearing what other travelers do is helpful!
Hi how did you go on with your insurance ?
@GAC-thanks for the advice! This is my first time to Italy and Venice is a bucket list place for me. But I don’t know that we want to compromise the entire trip over a city we only planned to visit for 25 hours.
"A statement from leading Italian virologist Dr. Fabrizio Pregliasco of the University of Milan, who has lately been appearing daily on Italian news programs, may be useful for those contemplating or planning travel to Italy more than ONE WEEK FROM TODAY:He stated, in an interview with journalist Lilli Gruber on the channel 7 program OTTO E MEZZO this evening (21:30 Italy time) that the Italian Government should have sufficient information within about ONE WEEK whether the draconian measures heretofore taken to contain the spread of the Coronavirus in Northern Italy have been largely successful, or weather additional steps will need to be considered.https://www.la7.it/otto-e-mezzo/video/per-qu…Let's wait ONE WEEK to see how this situation evolves."
"The CDC just raised the alert to level 2 (3:20 pmPST) which recommends that older persons or those with chronic illnesses, including immunocompromised, should strongly consider cancelling their trip.We just returned from Milan and Venice on Saturday; there were sick people on both trains and planes; I spoke with our state health department and they did not recommend self-quarantine yet. Airports were already checking temps on saturday when we left Venice."
"Ultimately decided to cancel. I was able to get the change fees waived by Delta for both me and my friend to cancel and reroute to Paris and am now waiting to see if Easyjet and Ryan Air will allow me to do the same and allow me use the credit on other flights within Europe with the change fee waived. Delta was pretty understanding about it, no troubles whatsoever. Seems like they are aware of the situation and concerns and advisories. My original plans were to get into Venice via Paris next Tuesday and then return home from Rome via Brussels two weeks later. Delta was able to waive the change fees but of course we still had to pay any price difference which was pretty minimal.Edited: 10:38 pm, February 24, 2020 "
The link to CDC advice (#102) is herehttps:/…coronavirus-italy
how about the trains? are they checking the train passengers too?? we will be travelling from spiez to Milan and then to Venice on 12 April. very confused as what to do? should we go directly to Rome as our flight back home is from Rome.
"Your trip is not for another six weeks. In one week, we may know whether this contagion in parts of Northern Italy is under control or not. I suggest waiting at least under then before considering any significant travel changes."
GAC good advice to wait a week or so when it will be known what effect the measures have had. Can you post an update?My Italian wouldn’t be up to that
"Dennis A.Thank you for the link.It won't be much of a relaxing time if constantly being aware of sneezing and touching things etc.I'm still really unsure - taking it day by day but thinking of not going. it's going to be too stressful and that's not what I want from a holiday in Venice.Edited: 7:13 am, February 25, 2020 "
"We're in Venice now, and have been since Saturday. We're house sitting for somebody and can't leave because we're looking after their pets. All museums and churches are closed, so we're really not sure what to do."
hi. we changed everything last minute at the aeroport))) we did not go. Better safe than sorry.
"if someone still not sure what to do... do it now... before to late, we lost all money."
"Ryanair and EasyJet are not giving refunds at this time. I had written them yesterday and just heard back from them. I am down $700US, but still, I think I made the right the decision to cancel for myself and my family. Everyone has to decide for themselves. Per reports, there were 60 new cases of coronavirus today in Italy including one case in Florence and Sicily and a new case in Austria and Croatia from people who recently traveled to northern Italy and there is a scare in Tenerife right down due to a Dr. and his wife from Lombardy testing positive. It’s spreading like crazy. :(Edited: 8:55 am, February 25, 2020 "
"Yes, most (if not all) ""new"" cases (they are only newly discovered) are related to the closed ""red"" area in Lombardia.@BL you did the right thing, I think you would be fine, but your circumstances are extremely sensitive. And you would not be able to experience the best of Venice with everything that is going on, although, Venice is NOT a source of any virus breakdown.It is only logical the virus would spread - it is a virus after all and who knows how many people travel to/from Italy each day everywhere. I am following italian news (I am fluent in Italian) and they are doing everything they can to keep the spreading under control, always repeating that, apart from those most infected areas that are locked down, Italy is a safe country to travel to.It is useful to add that they have done more than 4,000 tests (while in France, for example, they have used only 300 tampons).Edited: 9:04 am, February 25, 2020 "

@115 have you tried to move the dates to the future? Shame about Ryan air etc. for @112 keep a close eye on things and if they start cancelling flights etc. you may be able to recoup your losses. Peace of mind is important and sounds like you did the right thing for you. It seems that in watching this move from China to so many other locations they all start like this and things move fast and changes are hourly
"I am re-posting here a posting I made this morning on a different thread, because I have taken note of some VERY SLANTED reporting by U.S. print and especially broadcast media of the Coronavirus situation in Italy:Here are some facts which I believe warrant travelers to exercise caution before quickly cancelling their trips to Italy:The RATE OF INCREASE of new Coronavirus cases has DROPPED PRECIPITOUSLY in Italy over the past three days: from a 100% increase (75 to 150), to a 50% increase (150 to 229) to a 25% increase (229 to 287). To an non-expert like me, this seems QUITE SIGNIFICANT. Yet U.S. media is ""omitting"" this fact, and merely report that the number of cases is continuing to rise (which is technically true).Moreover, consider these additional facts:1. All seven fatalities in Italy were elderly patients with pre-existing conditions, some quite severe;2. 80% of cases recover without need of medical assistance;3. The vast majority of cases in Italy occurred within or have been traced to contagion within the ""red zones"" (mainly the Province of Lodi in southern Lombardy).The quarantine was imposed on Sunday, which means that there will certainly be additional new cases reported over the next week (because the incubation period is up to 14 days in the vast majority of cases). But by next Monday, and certainly within two weeks hence, we will know with high confidence whether the draconian measures heretofore imposed by the Italian Government in quarantining the red zones has been largely effective.Consequently, were I to be traveling to Italy in the near future, this is how I would react:1. If travelling two weeks hence, I would simply monitor the situation and not cancel anything immediately;2. If travelling one week hence, I would monitor the situation and be prepared to cancel or modify the trip on short notice;3. If travelling within one week, I would rearrange my trip to skip over Milan and Venice and other tourist towns in Lombardy, Veneto, Liguria, Piemonte, Friuli Venezia Giulia and Emilia Romagna, BUT PRIMARILY BECAUSE churches and museums are closed, and I would be greatly disappointed by that reality."
"GAC Thankyou..I will monitor the situation, as you suggest."
"GAC,Your last statement is the most important. It's no good to travel all the way to Italy if things will be closed. And we won't know if they're closed until the last minute. I don't want to stand outside these beautiful places while they're closed, healthy or not."
"My flight is to Bologna is on Thursday 27th and then travelling to Florence next day. Guys, do you know about situation in those cities? I know they are not in danger zone but I don’t want any hassle re self quarantine once I’m back. Has anyone got back from these cities recently and been told to take precautions?"
"I am not aware of any self-quarantine requirement in your case, but you need to check with the public health authorities of your country of origin. Activities of interest or of use to tourists are normal in Florence and also in Bologna (except that churches may have some restrictions). The most important thing you can do to protect yourself is to wash your hands frequently, especially after using public transportation and touching any flat or round surface. You can get the virus by touching your nose, mouth or eyes after coming in contact with the virus itself on a surface. Absent special circumstances, I don't see a reason to cancel the trip, unless you are seeking 100% protection against contagion there."
"QQ2, we listen only to NPR and BBC. Both have had experts on describing possible transmission by air, notably the ventilation system on the cruise ship as the reason cases kept spreading. China has recommended face masks since the beginning because of the fast spread of the disease. It's hard to find them there now in many places, and I have a former exchange student who has had to send special masks and respirators to her parents in Nanjing so they can go out of their apartment on the 1 of 3 days they are allowed.Regular flu and colds (colds are coronavirus also) are spread through air particle transmission, so no reason this virus isn't also. (BTW air transmission doesn't mean you walk outside and get the virus like you would get poisoned from toxic gases. It means that it can be passed through the air by virus laden moisture coming from breathing and sneeziing nearby.). FROM ONLINE MEDICAL SOURCES:-The principal mode of transmission is still thought to be respiratory droplets, which may travel up to six feet from someone who is sneezing or coughing.-CDC: The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet): Via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.--Bad ventilation and a botched quarantine on the Diamond Princess likely caused hundreds of illnesses and two deaths in the largest outbreak outside China. Purdue University's Qingyan Chen, an expert on ventilation during virus outbreaks, told BuzzFeed News. “In ships, you cannot filter the air well enough to stop viruses.”Health experts have warned about the potential for cruise ship outbreaks for years. A ship’s ventilation system, which relies on recirculated air filtered by medium-strength air filters, is an efficient way of spreading virus particles from room to room aboard a ship, said Chen. In a 2015 study, he and his colleagues looked at the spread of flu aboard cruise ships, finding that one infected person would typically lead to more than 40 cases a week later on a 2,000 passenger cruise, with transmission occurring through the ventilation system.(which is also how airplane ventilation works)Edited: 1:41 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"Hi Just adding to a post I made yesterday about everyone’s thought on Venice , sad to say I have changed my trip to Venice we are now going to Barcelona, we weren’t charged to change the trip as it was a little more expensive so no admin charge .. feel better now wasn’t the going that bothered us it was the thought of being quarantined on our return"
Now a confirmed case in Catalonia. Tbh if I don’t fly to Venice as planned on Saturday I’ll be staying at home.
Ina:I don't know where you live; you should check your own local news for that. But the BBC is reporting on its website that some schools in England have taken action/imposed restrictions where students/staff were in northern Italy on recent midterm break.
Re #122:There is a HUGE difference between hearing someone express an opinion on PBS or BBC(no matter how distinguished he or she is) and your relaying this opinion to others as accepted scientific fact. The way you described it you made it sound as if a team of scientists had just gotten off that ship and published written findings reaching that conclusion.

Like you scheduled to fly to Venice next week on Air France from Paris. Checked with them today and no go as far as a change. Dont go and forfeit the $$$. They act like there isn't even a problem. Probably will eat the money and be safe.We are now looking into someplace else to replace the 4 days in Venice. Have RT tix on SAS from Dulles to Paris from Mar 3 - 13. Only positive was Marriott who is being very helpful regarding cancelation. They went above and beyond.
"Delta is offering flight changes for no cost.Our original plan was to fly into Venice on the 28th and go to Florence on the 29th and onward for 10 days. After long thought, deliberation and obsessing over the research, Delta helped us change our flight into Florence and Expedia was great at changing our hotel reservations.I was so excited to see Venice, it's always been a dream of mine, but I feel like this is a smart compromise since my friend and mine only alternative was to cancel completely and reschedule for this time next year.Thank you to everyone for the advice, help and sharing your research!"
"Just to note regarding the excellent Johns Hopkins chart (#127) that the blob is over Rome in the case of Italy, as capital of Italy not location of problems. The Corriere del Veneto newspaper is here. Open in Chrome to be offered a translation https://corrieredelveneto.corriere.it/"
"A couple of posts on some of the many other threads on this from people who are in Venice might provide some on the ground information for those deciding whether to visit or not. “Restaurants and shops are all open, but churches are closed as well.”Venice is less busy and visitors are still going to the main sites just standing outside."
"GAC Thanks for all the sensible and helpful posts #117 is particularly true. The media report what makes a good news story which isn’t always an unbiased view. Measures may appear extreme but consider the facts, what impact travelling / quarantine would have on you and decide what’s right for you. Things change so quickly that if, like us you are travelling at the end of March the situation could be very different so we’ll keep a watching brief. If those who do go can post updates on the situation on the ground that would be useful"

"The true numerator is a complete unknown at this point.Until the true numerator is known posting mortality rates is conjecture.

I spoke with them this morning and the travel advice hasn't chnaged.However, If I was to cancel up to 24 hours before my depature I can get a refund of 60% for the hotel and airport duty and taxes, as my hotel under the booking can be cancelled up until 24 hours before.

We are flying out Monday my only concern is if BA cancel flight at last minute. Am told they have cancelled Milan flights. To be stuck at Heathrow would be a nightmare
Steven H - thank you for a sense of proportion. I am due to fly out to Veneto in a couple of weeks. I am not worried about catching a very mild form of flu but I am worried about everywhere being shut! The UK Government as usual is twisting itself inside out to avoid blame and protect their pals in the airline and insurance industries.
152 and 153-in flying into Florence tonight/landing tomorrow. I’ll try and hop on and provides updates from Florence:).
"Our American daughter is doing her semester abroad in Florence. As of right now her school has not shut down, though many American Universities have. On March 11 we are scheduled to fly to Florence for her spring break, spend a couple of days looking around and then have an apartment rented in Venice for 4 days before flying with her to Paris. My husband is 74 and prone to pneumonia so needless to say I am seeking insight."
"#155Cathy, I am 76 and with respiratory issues and taking prednisone for other matters, hence immune system vulnerable. I would not travel now. Do you have travel insurance covering pre-existing conditions. Have you, has your husband, sought medical advice. We cannot give such advice here. But can note that your husband fits the profile of most vulnerable. This has been a bad flu season in Italy as in North America.

"Kathy, just to add for whenever.California is nine time zones from Rome, as is Sydney. We are very familiar with traveling that far. You need to rest on arrival. Traveling eastward is known to cause more jetlag problems than westward. Most aircraft are pressurised to about 8000ft equivalent, 2% humidity. I wear a simple mask routinely to retain humidity in airways.A380, A350 and B787 aircraft made with composite materials are pressurised to about 6000ft, humidity 20%. Ten years ago in Italy I had had a cold, turned into a secondary infection. A local doctor told me he could not prescribe antibiotics until it got into my lungs. It got into my lungs in the 24 hours air travel home. Similarly I went from flu to pneumonia on a much delayed flight from London to Sydney, 52 hours, 1969. We now ask our doctors to prescribe keflex before long travel away, on a basis of trust that we will not use it unless there is a secondary infection, not to be used against virus.Readers of the last point may wish to see #42 herehttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g18…"
"There’ve been quite a few posts since my last visit. Heblady. Hope your trip goes well and the insurance isn’t needed. Enjoy walking around Venice and if you haven’t stopped looking on here do let us know what it’s like in Venice. I’ll be watching until our trip at the end of March and was hoping there would have been some feedback on what the situation on the ground is. As you say there is a lot on here and in the media that is scary making it difficult to know what it’s like if you are there. Even the official advice doesn’t show that. GAC thanks for all your informative posts on the various threads and clarifying they hope to reopen. Think I’ll trust more official sources than a newspaper. My Italian is good enough to to understand a headline on the Commune di Venezia website - if they have to extend the closure https://www.comune.venezia.it/it/content/cor…Or The Ministry of health dedicated website is http://www.salute.gov.it/nuovocoronavirusOr, in EnglishGov.UK - travel advice https:/…travel-advice-novel-coronavirus"

It has a lot of info on healthcare in Italy, lists of English speaking health care providers, and specific info on COVID19 in Italy.If your husband is prone to pneumonia, then he likely knows what it feels like when he has it or is getting it. He might discuss with his doctor the wisdom of getting in advance(or not) whatever medicine/antibiotic is usually prescribed when he gets it. At a minimum, you should take the name of that medication with you in case it has to be prescribed in Italy.https:/…Italy.html"
"Not wanting to take this off topic but I think it’s related given all the people considering their plans. Just read on BBC News app that BA and EasyJet are cancelling flights from the UK to Italy (BA flights to Venice 14-23 March are quoted but nothing on their website for those dates yet). This seems to be due to reduced demand rather than medical concerns from what I can gather (I’m on my phone / a train so no links). Occurred to me it might be worth people checking the contact details on any bookings - particularly if made some time ago. Changes, when known, will impact the effect on your plans"
I tried to put relevant details from post #160 on the thread on the Italy forum but I don’t get a reply option on my phone. Can someone copy it to the other thread
SKA..Thankyou..I came to see if any updates from UK..So far our flight is still going. The insurance will cover me if that is cancelled. The hotel would defer my booking till June..BUT would hate to be there then ( cruise ships etc) I am going to pack anyhow...If things change by the 3rd then Iwill deal with it then.
"Me and my girlfriend are set to travel to Venice on the 3rd of March, we are both students so cancelling is a sore subject since we have both scraped the bottom of the barrel to pay for this trip, she's just finished her exams and has a few more to study for when we get back, we are worried about the situation with the virus but also, getting there and everything is closed, or being quarantined. Is anyone there at the moment who can offer some insight. Really appreciate it (hotel won't refund but can move dates to a lot later on but due to circumstances wouldn't be able to rebook for next year but would lose all our ryanair payments)"
"Further to flight cancellations by EasyJet and BA, I have attached a link with an update.As far as I can tell no confirmation yet on what flights will be cancelled but as previously mentioned the cancellations are because of a lack of demand rather than health issues.Anyone who is due to fly in or out of Northern Italy with these carriers over the next month or so should make sure they keep an eye on this.https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/news.sky.com/…"

Think I'll nip off for a visit on Sunday. Judging from the news photos of its lack of crowds it'll be like stepping back into early twentieth century.
"""Easy Jet have not cancelled Venice flights""Yet...."
https:/…italy-travel-advisory.htmlCDC recommends avoiding non-essential travel to Italy.

Also follow this Veneto paperhttps://corrieredelveneto.corriere.it/
"“The Ghost Town of Venice”:https://nyti.ms/2PyYyFyAccording to Associazione Venezia Albergatori, an association of local hotel owners, 50 percent of reservations in Venice have been canceled in the last week. “The situation is dramatic for the industry,” said Vittorio Bonacini, the chairman.Mr. Bonacini estimates that since November, Venetian tourism, worth 3 billion euro or about $3.3 billion, “has probably lost 800 million euro.” Since the outbreak began on Feb. 21, he said, Venice hotels have lost almost 70 percent of their international visitors."
"Unless travel advice from your government is not to travel then when I checked this morning the MUVE website (official site of the Venice Civic museums) was showing closed until 1 March Lombardy have announced closures beyond them so, as far as we know, it looks like Venice will be open. Updates from those there say restaurants are open Temperature checks are quick. Venice is quiet - that doesn’t happen often. If your health and government advice mean travel is unlikely to be a risk consider that as well as carrying on your holiday as planned you will be supporting local businesses. Your choice, but if your business is reliant on tourism it must be affected. I just checked the webcam of St Mark’s Square. No one in a mask but quiet. There is a very good website called Venezia Autentica which lists businesses run by locals - so that you know you are contributing to the Venetian economy. They offer tours and there is a Friends card which gets you a 10% discount at various businesses - they have a minimum cost but you can pay more and you contribute to supporting local businesses. https://veneziaautentica.com/"
"The it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity to enjoy the amazing city of Venice, free from the curse of thousands of day trippers and passengers off of cruise ships. Take it while you can."
"Yeah, never seen Venice this quiet... But I do feel very sorry for the businesses; many still suffering from the loss of business they had after the acqua alta in November. Also never had so many locals just starting a conversation with me in cafés and restaurants. It's a very different atmosphere here now. Beautiful, but in a way a bit sad as well..."
Thanks for your posts Thursday. We arrived a few hours ago and currently enjoying lunch on Murano.
Well can't argue that it is a very unique time to see Venice...but if my government has a Level 3 warning not worth it. But Venice without the crowds would sure be great...
"Katy, how long are you staying? Murano must be even quieter than Venice... In a way I consider myself a bit lucky - we get to experience Venice at a very unusual time... Still hoping though that the virus can be overcome soon and things get back to normal! Have my next trip in May booked already, and really don't want to cancel..."
"Thursday - we are here for two weeks, all being well. Murano pretty quiet compared to same Saturday last year. Heading over to Grand Canal tonight."
Well it’s now level 3 from CDC and level 4 from the state department
"According to the CDC, human coronaviruses can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces for up to nine days at room temperature. However, they can quickly be rendered inactive using common disinfectants and may also dissipate at higher temperatures. It is not yet clear, however, whether the new coronavirus, COVID-19, behaves in a similar way."
Here’s an odd question for anyone who has recently returned from Venice.... has anyone been forced to do a Quarantine once they returned from to the states?
"The US has just announced plans to look at people coming in from Italy, so doubt if they've had a chance to develop quarantine plans. Also, I believe there is talk in scientific/medical community that incubation period could possibly be quite a bit longer than 14 days, so one thing they need to decide is how long they will keep people -- 21 days, 28 days, 35 days?I know that when they were setting up the rules for flights from China, they decided they wanted China flights coming only into certain cities so they could concentrate resources there, and those resources included housing for quarantined people, usually on current or former military bases. I'm not certain the one for JFK passengers, I think in Brooklyn, ever got used. I think the notion of quarantine scared off a lot of people from flying."
"""human coronaviruses can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces for up to nine days at room temperature.""Which isn't really an issue unless you not only come in contact with the surface but then spread it to yourself. If the seat back in front of you is covered in the virus it isn't jumping across to infect you. If it's on your tray table and you don't swipe it with your hand and then touch your eye,nose or mouth it's not likely to infect you.What's dangerous is someone coughing or sneezing near you. Supposedly you need a two metre safety zone. Two metres means if you have an aisle seat you're in the middle of five rows . I guess. Or at least three. One in front of you and one behind."
"The seatback TV screens, which are now commonplace on long-distance planes, are constantly being touched with the fingers of passengers to operate the entertainment system. These screens will need to be cleaned at the end of each flight to make sure that there is no contamination. Will each passenger see to this himself using moist wipes?"
Even if you touch it don't suck your fingers. Stick them in your eye. It's not your hands that are the issue. If you're really worried use your elbow to touch the screen.
"Update 29/02 1730Commune di Venezia https://www.comune.venezia.it/it/content/cor…Schools, museums, libraries, theatres, cinemas closed and no public events until 8 March if my Italian gets the gist right"
"@165, As far as I’m aware EasyJet haven’t cancelled any flight yet but will be doing so in the coming weeks due to a lack of demand and it is quite likely that flights to Venice will be effected. Therefore it’s important that anyone flying to Northern Italy with EasyJet over the coming weeks continues to keep checking their flight status.I’m due to fly from Bristol to Venice myself in 3 weeks. I paid over £100 for a return flight back in November. A Return ticket on the same flights is now less than half that price which tells me there must be a lot of unsold seats and therefore those flights most be in danger of being cancelled."
@193 Dean G I was wondering if anyone had any Easyjet flights cancelled yet - saw something saying they were going to cancel 500! We are due to fly to Venice on 17th March so could do with knowing soon to make arrangements/cancel other commitments. Hoping they don't do it the day before !
My daughter is in Venice at the moment. Only 30 people on her BA flight. They went to Burano yesterday from her photos there was no one around. They were hoping to visit Doges Palace and Basilica today as notice on door said due to open on March 1 but all still closed. We are due to fly on 18th March .
"We are the same and at the moment everything except shops,bars and restaurants is closed . We will still go if not on lockdown if flights are still running."
I have flight from Venice to Bari on March 17th and it was cancelled 2 days ago. Got the notice via email and they gave options to reschedule or refund. I chose refund. Strangely Yesterday they still emailed me notice saying online checkin has opened.

"If this is the period of time for easyJet’s cancellations etc then I do hope that they will give passengers notice. “The cancellations are for some flights between 13 March and 31 March 2020, most of which have multiple daily frequencies.

"@Dave K, I don’t think EasyJet have made any announcement yet on what flights they will be cancelling. BA have started to cancel flights and have told customers that they will get a minimum of 14 days notice. I hope EasyJet do the same. I’m a little torn as whether we should still travel. I share a house with my elderly mother and I’m quite concerned about bringing the virus back and her catching it. I honestly wouldn’t be too upset if they did cancel the flight as it makes the decision for me but like you I wouldn’t want to be told the day before."
"The cynical in me says Easyjet will cancel flights last minute.Due to impacted immune system as a result of steroids, I think the decision will be made for me by my consultant. So cancellation by Easyjet or not, I don't think I will be going but will be claiming on insurance..."
"I have looked at my flights as if to book again and there is only one flight on that day now which is mine (There were three) So, I think I'm on the flight that's going and others have possibly been transferred onto mine. But who knows. I wish they would cancel it outright to be honest and then I can move on with my life after claiming back the insurance. The fun of planning my days on holiday has sadly disappeared for me.Edited: 9:03 am, March 01, 2020 "
"#202 - for me there was only one flight to/from Venice from Liverpool - it is still there, half full and cheaper than when I booked last Sept"
"Our flights on delta were pretty well sold out prior to this. I looked this am at the seating charts and now they are only about half full. People are cancelling, Delta is still flying however as of this am at least out of Venice. Our flights to Italy connected in Paris from msp and then on to Naples, the Paris leg has opened up as well. I can’t see the Paris Naples flight. These were flights in April."
The U.S. State Dept. has announced a Level 4 Warning (do Not go) for the Veneto and Lombardy regions (includes Venice and Milan) and a Level 3 (no unnecessary travel) for the rest of Italy. I believe these travel warnings are through April but the situation is fluid and unpredictable.
"#204 what day are you flying? We go from MSP to Paris on March 17th, connecting to Venice. Noticed a lot of open seats last time I checked as well, and were still outside Deltas voucher window by 2 days."
"We weren’t traveling until April. We are in the process of cancelling. I’m not flying back 18 hours or however long the leg is to jfk, in an airplane filled with people leaving Venice.Edited: 11:13 am, March 01, 2020 "
@207...I think Delta will be cancelling those non stops so if you wait till they do so avoid fees...not sure how they are handling April at this point.

I am scheduled to fly out to Venice on March 10. I booked through Ovago and flying Lufthansa... I emailed Ovago yesterday and they will not do anything for me at this time. Said business as usual and I can only change with $300 per ticket change fees... I already changed this trip once... I’m just waiting it out at this time. Not scared of the virus. But scared of getting stuck in Munich (our connecting) or stuck getting home the following week on the 17th...
"We are booked to go to Venice on the 18th March we haven’t got a problem going but a lot of stuff is closed museums, churches even shops ,bars and restaurants . Daughter is there at the moment."
There will be new regulations and recommendations from national and regional governments published Monday. If anyone can assist in placing such information in this thread When it’s published please do. https:/…105810021
"They are published, museums are allowed to open if there is 1 meter between visitors- same rule for bars & restaurants"

"""They are published, museums are allowed to open if there is 1 meter between visitors- same rule for bars & restaurants.""What happens when the distance between two visitors somehow become less than 1 meter? Can visitors receive a refund?Edited: 9:23 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"Enforcing the 1-meter rule at crowded museums such as the Uffizi will require pre-recorded messages barking every 90 seconds on loudspeakers in each exhibition room: ""MIND THE GAP"""
"We are flying from Paris to Milan on April 11th. Then to Venice, Florence and Rome. Flying back from Rome to JFK on April 21st. Flights, trains, hotels and some tickets are already paid. Following this thread closely and hoping for the best."

Katy I think you beat everybody with that invaluable link. Another slice of haggis for you. Everybody read Katy’s link. As regards the speculation about crowd management I believe Italian visitors would be respectful. Hopefully others too. Making queues and avoiding crowds gathering outside will involve police I’m sure. And probably people in suits taking temperatures.
The official decree from the Commune di Venezia is mainly beyond my Italian but has the one motre rule subject to the constraints of the place. Not sure how that will work in Venice restaurants - can’t think of one with a metre between tables. https:/…20ministri.pdf
The regions are under the national decree. SKA have you tried opening the link in Chrome browser to get a translation?Everywhere in the country the same rule. Another reason to discourage great crowds. A new experience sitting one metre apart. My anthropologist genes want to begin a longitudinal study of the evolution of social interaction beyond the range of pheromone drift. Time to look at the cameras on San Marco.
The one metre rule might not be difficult - last night we had a good walk through Cannaregio and many restaurants were occupied by only bored staff.
"Re post 218 this was a news report so they put out a story that makes good news but it doesn’t mean they are facts. I hope the family are ok and as they flew into Stanstead on Thursday and were rushed to be tested and haven’t been reported as having the virus it’s looking like it was a scare for them. - He developed symptoms quickly, I’m no medical expert but could he have had them when he flew in, or a cold?- It’s the time of year for colds, coughs and flu. - More cases are reported in all countries each day. More testing means more are identified. As I see it the risk on a flight may be higher but going about daily life isn’t risk free. We are monitoring and still intend to go to Venice at the end of March as things stand but that could change. I’d rather trust official sources than the news or those in the tourist industry - each has a vested interest. I’ll be checking the following and we’ll consider what we do (it’s a special birthday trip for my husband but we’ve agreed if the situation changes and the UK government advice is not to travel or the impact will spoil the trip for us we can visit Venice another time. If it was my parents travelling I’d say stay at home - their age and dad’s health issues make it more risky. We each have to decide according to our circumstances). UK government health advice. Updated at 2pm each dayhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covi…UK government travel advicehttps:/…healthCommune di Venezia Coronavirus updateshttps://www.comune.venezia.it/it/content/cor…Tripadvisor thread people who’ve been to Venice are sharing their experience on. What do the measures actually mean?https:/…105819231This is a serious issue. Please try to keep this thread to facts. Post links to news articles but don’t take everything in them as fact. There was a report on BBC News on Monday that BA flights to Venice between 14 and 24 March may be cancelled. I added it here and when I checked yesterday nothing on the BA site for flights after 11 March. It will probably happen - they’ll consolidate flights rather than fly half empty planes - but it shows even reliable news reports aren’t right all the time. The situation changes too quickly."
"regarding the rather alarmist article in post #218, I would note that the incubation period, from what is said to be known, seems to be a minimum of 9 days, but is looking that it might be even longer, so these symptoms within hours of arriving to Dolo are impossible to have been caused by the Covid19 virus contracted on the flight or after arrival to Veneto."
"Note more Airlines are now reducing flights into Northern Italy some with immediate effect, see update on the attached at 9.09.https:/…world-asia-51701043"
"I’m planning to visit Venice this coming Thursday, flying from Berlin. I’m checking the FCO travel advice daily and until they say not to travel I plan to still go. It would be useful to hear from anyone out there at the moment as all of the media and news is creating more fear and paranoia to those that are outside of the country."
"The decree of the Italian government Monday is at #103 here, in translation. https:/…105820220That sets rules and recommendations for all regions. #225. Important to keep up with facts and avoid advice based on inaccuracy. It has been known for weeks that a serious problem in managing this virus is that the disease COVID-19 can be transmitted before symptoms evident. ."
Well that's our Ryanair flights cancelled...
#229... oh no! When were you due to fly?
"Angela, I agree. This is a good thread for what it’s like from people’s experience. Not as bad as the media reports make out. https:/…105827938Judge for yourself. If it’s helpful please say thank you - I’ve found the thread useful and expect the situation will change again before we travel at the end of the month and would value updates continuing. If you have an update from an official source post on here. This has been another invaluable source of information but sometimes the number of posts can be a bit overwhelming and keeping official and personal experience separate saves either getting lost."
Helenrosanblatt if you are still following thanks for starting the thread
"Yes - I'm due last week in March with my friend, Her flight with ryanair was cancelled this afternoon - my easyjet flight still going so far... (everything crossed that doesn't change)As long as I can get there, and govt advice doesn't say not to go, I'll be going. It's rage inducing the amount of rubbish being published regarding this situation. It's not easy weeding out the relevant and reliable information from the inaccurate and sensational stuff out there.Edited: 2:48 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"Thanks everyone, I agree that this thread has been very useful. I hope everyone has a lovely time that does plan or are still able to go. So far I’ve not heard anything regarding our easyJet flight but will keep checking in. From what I’ve heard from a friend travelling back to the UK from Venice, they are checking your temperature at arrivals at the airport."
SKA LondonI'm still following all the posts and other links regarding the Virus in Italy/Venice.Still undecided if we are going but thinking probably not despite not being refunded for accommodation unless the Italian government lock down Venice which I now think unlikely.
Has anyone from the UK had their Easyjet or Ryanair flights to Italy cancelled yet ? If so when were you supposed to fly and to where ? Wondering how much notice they will give - hopefully not same day but at least a bit of notice
"Dave K, Ryanair have advised that they will give at least 14 days notice if your flight is cancelled https:/…3fampFrom what I have read on Twitter it seems the majority of flights being cancelled are from Heathrow or Gatwick and to various locations (some to Italy and some elsewhere). My assumption is that they do multiple flights from these locations per day and so they are trying to merge flights so they are fuller.My flight to Venice from Bristol is on 2nd April with Ryanair and has not been cancelled (yet). There is only one flight a day from Bristol to Venice. It also looks like they are cancelling some peoples flights there but not back (and vice versa). So you could have a refund on only one flight."
We are due to fly to Naples at the end of the month with Easyjet and have not been notified that our flights are going to be cancelled.
"EU Airlines will try to give you at least 14 days notice of a flight cancellation or they have to pay you compensation in some instances.We are flying with BA on 20 March from LGW and our flights are still being sold. Friends flights on 15th have been cancelled so I’ll be checking 14 days before our flight departs. I will not be travelling as my friend has been told by her boss that she will have to self isolate with no pay for 2 weeks on her return. This is whether or not she has any symptoms and she is not in a position to argue.So I’ll likely lose the flight cost but unless BA cancels, I’ll claim taxes back only if I cancel.Really sad as I love Venice and would have continued with my plan to travel if going with someone in a better position."
"Such a shame, SWL, though I appreciate your companions situation. Would you consider going on your own? I love Venice when I'm travelling solo. I was travelling with a friend this trip, and Ryanair cancelled her flight - but at the moment my Easyjet one is still going (fingers crossed that doesn't change) so I'm heading on on my own. It can be so self indulgent travelling on your own - just doing what you want, when you want. And Venice is the perfect place to dander and see where you end up. Would be such a shame to miss out if you could still travel yourself (obvs still following all the offical advice)"
"Kathleen37As I’ve been twice before I wanted to treat my friend so have paid for the whole trip. She’s had some real health problems and continues to have financial issues so it is my treat to her, wouldn’t be the same by myself! Happy to rebook in the future. Luckily the apartment is fully refundable. Gutted to be fair but off to Seville for a few days this weekend with my husband so have that to look forward to.Absolutely feel for the Venetians, it truly is a remarkable city."
"Just had BA confirm that our flight is indeed cancelled. Will get a full refund and will book another time.Edited: 8:26 am, March 03, 2020 "
"A lot of airlines are now allowing re-bookings, but not free cancellations which is a shame. I too am on EasyJet coming from Gatwick....all plans are a go for April 15th still. I too am solo and hopefully will be able to take advantage of the lower tourist #'s with all the cancellations happening right now."

"Due to fly out on the 9th, after waiting an hour to speak to an agent they advised of no refunds and heavy fees to change the booking. Will be doing a no show otherwise they will sell the tickets on!!"
Our airline is Easyjet
"I'm due to fly on 30th, unless the decision is taken out of my hands by authorities or Jet2 I am hopeful to travel."
We're due to arrive in Venice on the 18th for 2 nights. As of now if things stay similar to the picture today I think we'll be going.

"Our Lufthansa flight connects in Zurich but they have cancelled the Zurich to Venice leg. On the way back, they moved the Venice to Zurich leg up 1 day early. Will try to get a refund from Lufthansa. Our hotel Londra Palace was nice enough to extend our fully prepaid credit to next year. Hope everything works out for everyone else."
"We were flying Ryanair from Stansted, Wednesday 18th. After it was cancelled, we've rebooked for the Sunday before (15th). From checking, it looks as if they've cancelled the Wednesday/Thursday flights for the following few weeks so it's more of a demand issue than anything."

"#154 Curious what date were you supposed to travel? We are scheduled for April 16 ZRH to Venice with SwissAir, have not seen any cancellations yet, but of course it is early.Edited: 3:35 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"We were supposed to fly out with Lufthansa/Swissair LAX-ZUR-VCE on 3/20 but ZUR-VCE is cancelled. Flight back 3/27 VCE-ZUR cancelled and moved to 3/26 with ZUR-LAX remaining intact on 3/27. Got email about change of date for 3/27. Checked website this am and found out ZUR-VCE 3/20 got cancelled but didn’t get email notice. I guess they expect you to check yourself. Per Lufthansa website, up to 25% mid and short distance flights can be cancelled for Europe."
"#257 Thanks for the info. Still to early for my flight since it is not until April, but of course would not surprise me. Did you look at possibly taking a train from Zurich to Venice?"
"Hi everyone, Thank you all for your help so far on this thread. My partner and I are due to fly to Venice on Thursday from Berlin. And then from Venice back to Gatwick. I’ve looked at changing our flight to just fly from Berlin to Gatwick but the prices are more than our original flights we paid. Why would they cancel flights later rather than sooner? If anyone has recently returned back from Venice to London could you advise whether we should still self quarantine, even as a precaution? I’ve been checking the FCO website and although it says only if we have symptoms we don’t need to; but I think my place of work would still rather I self-quarantined. All of the paranoia and fear back in the UK is what’s making me want to cancel my trip as opposed to catching the virus itself."
"The Irish Dept of Foreign Affairs has just issued a ""do not travel to Veneto unless essential"" advice notice tonight so I'm sure that that will lead to cancellation of many flights from Ireland."
#258. I was able to cancel the Lufthansa reservation and got full refund. They had changed the itinerary too much making us leave Venice one day earlier too and we had paid for hotel that night. It was too much of a hassle to rearrange. We were able to get hotel credit and will visit Venice next year.
"https:/…""For the moment, we are advising against non-essential travel to the regions of Lombardy, Veneto, Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna""So, I'm (hopefully) flying from Belfast where it is currently ok to go from....."
"”So, I'm (hopefully) flying from Belfast where it is currently ok to go from.....”You do realise that the advice from your Government is for your protection and border hopping to get round “ advice” will mean you travel without insurance and with the risk of bringing the virus home with you. With any luck you will be quarantined on your return."
I certainly wouldn’t wish quarantine on anyone.
"We cancelled our april Italy trip, and rescheduled it for next year same time, same company. Primary reason was the tour ends in Venice and our return flight was from Venice to JFK, no thanks, not taking any chances with quarantine from being on a flight with 150 people returning from Venice.Edited: 12:03 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"I'll be following the official advice. I'm not ""border hopping"". My flights have been booked from Belfast since last year. If I'm told to self quarantine on my return (if I hopefully make it - I wouldn't be surprised if the UK do the same as Ireland soon) so be it. I live on my own and don't work, so have no intention of becoming a risk to anyone, or myself. If there is no ""essential travel only"" from the UK, then my insurance is fully valid."
"Kathleen, I wish you all the best for your trip.Venice is a magical place but I wouldn’t go near the Veneto if you paid me right now."
Finally decided that it would be too risky to travel to Venice on March 10th. Have read that Easyjet might be cancelling some flights from Italy between March 13th to March 30th. So can't take the risk of our return flight being cancelled and then having the stress of trying to get back to Liverpool.The whole thing has been a nightmare for me and my husband. I booked this holiday back in August 2019.I was really looking forward to returning to lovely Venice and exploring the region a bit more using the train and vaporetto. I feel sorry for the people who live there and rely on our tourism to make a living.Helen
"Thanks for the good wishes. I do understand your concern, but from the research I've been doing regarding how it's spread and contracted and speaking with friends that live in San Marco and Malamocco, life is going on as normal and I am fully prepared to follow all the advice regarding protecting myself and other people. I very sadly lost my Mum last year, and had she still been alive, I wouldn't be going, as I could in no way risk her compromised health. My decision to go has a lot to do with my current situation. Being able to self quarantine without impacting anyone else has a lot to do with it. For me, Venice is worth the inconvenience as it will only be me that is being inconvenienced."
"Remain aware of possible direction to self-quarantine in Italy if you have any signs of this disease.There are a number of decisions being made right now by the Italian government, new assessments of the virus.

"#268 we are the same. out insurance wont pay to cancel as they say it is out choice. plus if wr go they wont pay for any coronavirus claim as the fine print on the pollicy saying we must not be aware of any circumstance which could lead to cancellagion or disruption claim. they advise that for sny travel commencing after 28 feb travellers would be aware of this.we been planning our trip for a year and were travelling for two months (mostly in Italy). and stand to lose deposits in five figures. its been very upsetting.Edited: 12:55 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"@Helenrosenblatt, sorry to hear you have had to cancel. I’m due out on the 20th but I think it’s looking increasingly unlikely we will travel now."
"Helenrosenblatt, Sorry you had to cancel, you've been here from the start and Im sure this was not easy. i believe you made the right call, we cancelled as well and are very disappointed, but our tour company rebooked us for the same trip exactly 365 days later, so next year we go and it will be so much more enjoyable not worrying about this stuff."

"#273S35FlyerGlad you've been able to book again. Hopefully, in a year things will be different. I'll definitely be going again to Venice, but I will not be travelling abroad until this sitation has been contained.A staycation in the U.K. in October looks like the next time I can get away. Even that could be tricky if this virus isn't sorted.Helen"
#272 Dean G.Thank you. Sorry you might not go.
"""Even that could be tricky if this virus isn't sorted"" if this flu stays around until next flu season, next autumn, we just may need to start planning construction of the next ""Salute"" church, in Venice, or if there is no one left here, someplace else that managed to survive..."
"I've had to cancel my trip to Venice and Rome as well intended for early April.

Had no choice there unfortunately if I need to return home :("

Booking.com questionCan someone explain the cancellation fee to me.We fully paid for our accommodation back in August. The payment was non refundable.Now if we want to cancel or reschedule they say we will be charged a cancellation fee which is nearly as much as we paid in the first place. I have asked them to explain this but they keep on avoiding the answer.Does it mean I have to pay and extra charge on top of what I've already paid our?many thanksHelen
"Honestly nobody here can answer your question.Normal booking.com reservations are subject to the hotel policies. Those can vary by room type or offer booked. Each hotel setting its own rules.booking.com basic is a prepaid offer that booking.com offers from third party booking agents. In short you need to check the terms on your reservation.But no you shouldn't be paying more for a cancelation of a fully prepaid. It's possible the ""cancellation fee"" they've mentioned is how much they'll keep of your previous payment. But that's only a guess."
#282Thank you for your reply and explanations.
"I had a non refundable booking via hotels.com. I didn't even bother contacting them, but I did email my hotel (who to be fair I have stayed with before) and asked if they could help at all? They said I can rebook no charge if my flight on 23rd March is cancelled. I so hope it isn't and I can still go.I think it would be worth you trying to contact the hotel direct and ask if they can change your booking. Good luck!"
Kathleen 37Thank you for advice.Helen
"I think the ""cancelation fee"" may be the payment you have already paid. As you have paid for a non-refundable booking, if they do try to charge you any additional monies, I would quickly take that up with your bank or credit card company.They have no obligation to refund you at all since you booked as you did but some people have said they have asked for a chance to book a later date and some hotels are agreeing to that even though they do not have to; not all of them are but no harm in asking.There is always a risk booking a non-refundable accommodation (and, anything else) - Good luck - hope they will work with you and clarify this issue of a cancelation fee -"

"Thank you again, GAC"
Asking this question for a friend who is at the airport right now trying to get home to Venice. She is a US citizen who lives in the USA 6 months of the year and lives and works in IT for the other 6 months. She has a ticket from Washington DC to Venice with a change in Frankfurt on Lufthansa. Lufthansa is saying that the flight from Frankfurt has not been cancelled but that they cannot guarantee that it will take off. They have also suggested that maybe she could take a train or drive to Padua. Does anybody see a way to get into the red zone? She is more than willing to self quarantine and has already booked her return flight to the US for Oct. 2020. It wouldn’t be a really big deal except that she has rented out her US house starting tomorrow and will be homeless here and paying rent in Venice unless she can figure out a way to get there.
"She may need to demonstrate an ""exigency"" requiring her to live in Padova, for example, to satisfy a work contract or undertaking. She could show her Italian rental contract as evidence that she has definitive lodging in Italy and will not be going from hotel to hotel. The current governmental decree seems to be intentionally vague as to what constitutes an ""exigency"", to enable local officials to exercise some degree of flexibility. Most importantly, she needs to show that she is not coming to Italy for tourism, but for legitimate work reasons."
The new red zone isn't like the old one. There will be people moving in and out. They're just trying to limit the number of people moving around needlessly. You're supposed to be able to head home. Now does this mean she won't be challenged? Who knows. The trains are supposed to be still running from everything I've heard.
GAC thanks for post 288 confirming Venice will be in the red zone until 3 April. We woke up to media reports of the decree and the date was the important piece of information we needed.
"Well that scuppers our re-arranged trip it would seem.It's odd and I guess the lack of clear information is because providers etc are still trying to digest what it means for their operations. But I've seen a few places now say that whilst it is essentially a lock-down of nobody comes in and nobody leaves (bar emergencies), planes and trains are still operating.So are they running them empty then? Are they for the few people who have emergency reasons to enter/exit?Hoping Ryanair are prompt at least at refunding."
flights still going and no change in travel advice from the government!!
"it seems to me airlines are abdicating their responsibility, they have your money and unless FO says they cant fly they will not cancel so no refunds. and no insurance claim"
Well at the moment they haven't actually activated it (it's still being passed through parliament) - And it's also a Sunday morning. Maybe practice a bit of patience and wait and see what happens in the coming days?
"Early hours and developing situation which will hopefully become clearer soon, The FCO website has been updated to include the extension of the red zone to to Venice but it is not crystal clear in that the travel to anywhere beyond the original towns is not advised.From the Easyjet website:-We are aware of the latest Italian media reports of local government plans to introduce restrictions in the Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna regions including Milan and Venice. However, we have had confirmation that currently our operations to and from Milan-Malpensa, Milan-Linate and Venice airports are not affected and we plan to operate our flight schedule as normal.So at the moment it appears you can get a flight but whether you can go anywhere once you land is another matter...."
"#299 Dave K.Posting from your post - Dave K.'We are aware of the latest Italian media reports of local government plans to introduce restrictions in the Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna regions including Milan and Venice. However, we have had confirmation that currently our operations to and from Milan-Malpensa, Milan-Linate and Venice airports are not affected and we plan to operate our flight schedule as normal''This is madness. Typical of Easyjet. Hopefully, credit card people can sort out refunds.Situation might change, though.Edited: 9:14 am, March 08, 2020 "
I think it must change - how can you fly to a place where you aren't allowed to travel around. I would guess are Easyjet are waiting for an explicit directive from the FCO.
"We were due to fly out this morning from Bristol, but haven't gone. Afraid we might have had to stay until April 3rd and looking at insurance, this may have been at our own expense. We were all packed and ready to go and I think its mad that airlines are still taking people, I guess this will all change in the next few days."
We are due to fly out to Milan on Thursday. Easyjet are still saying they are flying. What is the point. The whole of Lombardy is in lock down!!!
#303: Have some patience. The lockdown is not in effect yet. How do you expect all consequences to be drawn from an order that was leaked to the public just last night before it was even signed by the government? It doesn’t mean that all flights and trains are canceled anyway.
"Italian media is reporting that TRAINS AND PLANES should continue to operate, even to, from and within the red zones, HOWEVER passengers will need to justify their travel plans by demonstrating a compelling business or personal need to travel.This means that tourists returning home should be allowed to board their flights, provided that the air carrier has not cancelled the flight itself.The red zones are NOT in total lockdown!!!"
it appears to me the airlines are waiting for FO advice to change so the buck passes to the insurance companies
If there is anyone visiting the areas the decree on the red zones / extended isolation areas who doesn’t know one of the restrictions that will affect your stay is bars & restaurants are only allowed to open 0600-1800. Should just give you time to get something to eat
UK Foreign Office has just (18.45) advised against all but essential travel to affected zones.

"In case it helps anyone, we weren't due to travel until 13 April, but just called our insurer now on the off-chance and they have accepted our claim. I was really just calling to ask if we have to wait until after 3 April to see what the update is, but they said there is no end date on the FCO guidance so we are covered.The next challenge will be getting a cancellation invoice from easyjet, which will no doubt take some time, but let's see. Thanks for all the updates. Hope you all get your trip to Venice at some point soon.L"

And we have been in a lot of contact with them over the last couple of days,  Then, On Sunday, The aparthotel themselves cancelled us and said they will give us a refund with no cancellation fee.However, today, they inform us that they can't refund us . They are now in trouble financially.We've opened a claim on Visa. This will take time to process.I feel very sorry for the hotel if they can't continue.I would still like to stay there in the future.Easyjet have cancelled our flights for today and are issuing a refund."
"#311 Easyjet seem to be cancelling 24-48 hours before flights are due, which logistically makes sense. They'd save time by explaining this to customers. We were due to fly later this month, so I see no point in chasing them yet."
"#313 You are correct bunny19.I spoke to them yesterday as I was wanting to switch flights at pretty well the same times in/out as my Venice ones to Paris, but they still want £35 a flight + fare difference to change. That was around £500 for 4 flights that cost £210. My argument was that you WILL cancel my flights so your way of keeping my cash is to let me transfer.If you check you'll see that all return flights from Venice are ""SOLD OUT"", well coming back to Luton, until 3rd April. We obviously all know that means they are cancelled but why not do the decent thing. There was a Times reporter 5Live this morning saying airlines are dealing with the situation very sympathetically. Yea right!!To be fair at least EJ answered my call. The apartment company Truly Venice are returning neither calls or emails. They know they can't provide the service e.g. meeting us at the apartment & more importantly providing support if we needed it at any hour day or night (per their terms) which is why they are hiding waiting until Thursday when I'll cancel just to get my 10% back. Given they won't talk to me I'm going to assume they've done a runner & get the credit card company to refund me.I'll get the cash back on insurance for both if I need to but a bit of civility wouldn't go amiss."
We were due to fly from Gatwick to Venice with BA. British Airways sent an email earlier to say they’d cancelled our return flight but we’d had nothing about our outward flight. After holding for a while they are offering to rebook flights for dates to the end of May or offering a refund. We took a refund on both the outward and return flights. Waiting for the confirmation - guess the systems are overloaded. Their website hasn’t been updated. Maybe check out Manage my Bookings. Feel for those needing to return but if you are booked to travel between now and early April our experience was relatively easy. Email about out outbound flight came through later but person on the phone had already processed refund.
"Helen, Had you already paid for your accommodation or were you due to pay at the property?"
"We were due to fly EJ Bristol to Rome on 16 March returning 20 March. I cancelled Airbnb apartment 2 days ago and have received a refund less some fees. EJ don’t seem to be updating their website, in fact they are still selling seats on the flight. EJ have just emailed me offering car hire whilst in Rome! I am going to sit it out till the weekend to see if they cancel the flight. We could change the flights but £132 plus extras and the £200+ already paid makes for expensive flights."
"According to BBC website Easyjet have finally now announced the cancellation of all but a few 'rescue' flights to the affected areas until April 3rd.Still no update on their website though, which is really poor."
I’ve just seen that too but my flight on Saturday is still scheduled!
We are due to go 4th April! Grrr wish they would cancel and refund
Just saw my cancellation on the Easyjet App!!
What date amass you going
"Hi, what you decided to do?"
COVID-19 and pregnancy:https://bit.ly/2xyYfEz
What is your date #321? My flight with Easyjet has yet to be canceled for April 15. They are allowing free 1 time cancellations now though.
I have given up thoughts of returning to Venice in the near future for it is impossible to predict how long Corvid19 will linger around.I am currently consoling myself opening a bottle of 2015 La Tirella Amarone della Valpolicella DOCG. It will go well with the ox-tail stew bubbling away for our meal tonight.
#326Same here. I had a lovely holiday planned for my second visit to Venice. I hope to go next year but who knows what this virus has in store for us.
"A new study suggests that COVID-19 can remain in the air for up to three hours and live on surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel for up to three days.The research, published in the medRxiv depository, also notes that the virus can remain on copper surfaces for four hours and cardboard for up to 24 hours."
My flight is 4th April with easy jet I haven’t had any. Notifications I can change or alter keeps asking me to check in
Jo - my original flight back from Venice was this Sat 14th and EasyJet only emailed me yesterday to cancel. Think they are wanting passengers to make the decision so they don’t have to pay anything.
"For anyone who has been to Burano there is a lady called Silvia who is the guide for the island & lives there with her husband & 2 children. We have taken a couple of her tours & were due to have lunch with her in just over a week, but have adhered to the advice. This is a short extract from her email today.""First of all let me reassure you on the fact that me and all of my family and all of Burano citizens are fine. I don't know personally anyone that has caught it so far, but this doesn't mean that one day there will not be cases. I personally think that this lockdown is the best idea they have had so far. Still, people keep going out, despite the rules.... I guess we are just Italians, we take rules for ""suggestions"" haha! I am at home anyway, and just look at the world from my windows.This virus is awful. It's invisible but as scary as a tornado.I really hope this will all end soon and that all people will be able to hug, kiss and hang out together again. That moment will be amazing.""Just thought some of you might be interested in the view from the islands.Edited: 5:50 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"How heartwarming. Thanks for sharing, Hooly."
Hooly thanks for sharing. It’s good to know how people are coping. Hopefully measures that may seem extreme will contain the virus enough that life can return to some normality
"Unrecognized, milder cases of COVID-19 are likely the driving force behind the rapid spread of the virus throughout the world, a new study suggests.People with recognized infections were sicker and more contagious. They are the ones who got and largely followed orders to isolate themselves from others.86% of infections were mild enough that people didn’t seek medical care or confirmation of their symptoms. These milder cases were only about half as contagious as the recognized infections, but because there were so many more of these undocumented cases than the documented ones, the unrecognized cases were the ones fanning the flames of the outbreak.https://wb.md/2IYN6zo"

"Any ideas about travelling to Venice and enjoying holidays there in June, July, August and even September 2020 are optimistic in the extreme.I have abandoned any hope of taking my annual visit to Venice this year and just hope all will be settled in time to book next January for a April/May 2021 visit."
"I must say,that I am optimistic and have booked my beloved Bonnvecchiati for December, what will be,will be."
"I found this travel advisory website for Italy - with the latest quarantine measures and tourist attractions that are reopening in the country: https:/…post-covid19-travelling-to-italy. Not much about Venice standalone, but Italy on the whole."
