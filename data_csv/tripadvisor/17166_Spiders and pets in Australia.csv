"Hello every one!The way my career is going, I may have the opportunity to relocate to Australia.It has always been my dream to move to Australia but as I got later into college and my career I thought that it would never come to light, so I got comfortable where I was/ am currently living in California and I now have two fur children. I would love to be able to accept a position there when it becomes available but my main concerns are my pets interactions with spiders. I myself am terrified but what I am really worried about is my pets getting bit by a dangerous spider. I was wondering how common it was to see a dangerous spider indoors in the Melbourne area, and if it was a common thing for indoor animals to get bitten by said dangerous spiders?Thank you in advance!"
You are worried about nothing. There are 4 million people in Melbourne and many have pets. They all survive and don't get bitten by spiders. You are much more likely to have an accident.
"Spiders are seldom seen indoors, and I have not heard of injury to a household pet by a spider. It would be about as usual as a dog being eaten by a bear in California.However, you need to make some serious investigation of Australaia's quarantine laws to see whether you can bring these pets with out. Johnny Depp got into quite some trouble when he brought his pet dogs here."
"Hi, I can understand your concern, but it really is pretty safe here. I’ve had pets all my life and never known them to have spider bites. If you plan on living here and want some peace of mind, then have your home sprayed for insects and spiders....not everyone will agree with this, but it will make you feel safe. The real issue for your pets is ticks. They can be leathal and must be given tick prevention treatments, from a small chew and or a small vial of tick treatment on their coat. This is normally given monthly through summer, but a vet will advise you. Don’t let horror stories of our dangerous spiders and snakes put you off coming down under. Most of us haven’t had close encounters, or if we have they have been a scare rather than an attack. Good luck."
There is almost zero issue with spider bites on dogs in Australia ... funnel webs are not known to hurt them and are really only found around Sydney and environs. Red Backs may cause problems but there are no cases known of dogs dying from red back bites.There is an intense process for bringing dogs in from the USA ... it is not as time consuming as it used to be and is mainly concerned with rabies as Australia is free of it. There is no longer a long quarantine process. http://www.agriculture.gov.au/cats-dogshttps:/…dangerous-bugsEdited: 2 years ago

"I would also be weary of bringing pets to Australia, especially pets nearing the end of their lives. A friend of mine lived in USA for couple years. She transported her dog to UASA and then back to Australia when they moved back to Australia. It cost them a fortune in transport and Quarantine and the dog died about 6 months after they returned to Australia. I can only imagine the stress that the poor dog endured. It might have contributed to his end."
Ozzie wandrerer. There are no ticks in Melbourne!!!! They are a northern thing! So much incorrect info on TA today!!OP there is no need to worry at all. I have a friend who lives in your area but spends several months each year in Australia. Next year she will bring her young dog to spend our summer with her here.
"Don't be so sure of yourself nozzie. As a child I had a much loved dog die from tick bite in Sydney. Have never lived in Melbourne but the Australian Department of Health says""The Paralysis Tick, Ixodes holocyclus, is found along the eastern seaboard of Australia east of the Great Dividing Range, and possibly into Tasmania. It is commonly referred to as the grass tick, seed tick and bush tick depending upon its stage of development. It is not known to occur in South Australia, Western Australia or the Northern Territory."" They do not exclude Victoria."
"BrianR44 is correct.highstreetrdvet.com.au/blog/…""Paralysis tick is found along the eastern seaboard of Australia extending down in the coastal Gippsland region of Victoria. They like to live in bushy native terrain and long grass.""https:/…199118ddd8e69fd8cd2433b7b8f99ce5""As peak paralysis tick season starts, Professor Stephen Baker and animal health company MERIAL have charted the postcodes where at least 50 cases of tick paralysis were reported from October 2010 to last April, including one in St Kilda, to form a geo-map of cases across the state.Prof Barker said the eastern paralysis tick — usually found along the eastern seaboard of Australia — had made its way to central Melbourne.""https:/…is-your-area-a-hotspot-for-ticks""As Australia enters tick season, pet owners are being urged to remain vigilant and aware of the signs of tick paralysis after 14 reported cases in the Melbourne area, 2 of which sadly were fatal.""I would also point out that things which are usually found in X area can easily hitch a ride to Y area and take up residence there if the conditions are right. This is how we now have the Sydney Funnel Web on the South Coast of NSW, they once were limited to a very specific area in Sydney. So many people come down here to holiday, and they were being brought along in camping gear and in one memorable - at least it was to me - case a set of towels that a family brought here."
"I have had dogs all of my life including living on farms. They have never had ticks or needed to have preventive treatment for ticks, Nor have I ever known any friends or family who have animals have ticks.Dog owners in Melbourne or SA would not be advised to have dogs treated for ticks. Quite different in Sydney"
"""As the weather starts to warm up again, it is timely for us at Casey & Cranbourne Veterinary Hospital to remind you that the deadly paralysis tick is on the march down south in Victoria. Last year, two cases presented to us in November. One dog had been to Bairnsdale, the other had been to Sale. This year there have already been reported cases of paralysis tick in Melbourne. ""https:/…""Along with all the benefits of living in the most liveable city in the world, not having to worry about the paralysis tick was an added bonus.Unfortunately, thanks to climate change, they have arrived on our doorstep.""vetsinendeavourhills.com.au/paralysis-ticks-…""Hotspots across the Greater Melbourne area where eastern paralysis tick and/or the southern paralysis ticks have been reported include: 1. Bullengarook, Gisborne, NE Gisborne (3437) - 17 reported cases of tick infestation2. Chum Creek, Healesville and Toolangi (3777) - 7 reported cases of tick infestation3. Pakenham (3810) - 5 reported cases of tick infestation4. Melbourne (3000), Donvale (3111), Dandenong (3175), Silvan (3795) and Eltham (3095)- 4 cases of tick infestation5. Emerald (3782) - 3 reported cases of tick infestation""https:/…The-VIC-Tick-ThreatThat info is from three different vets in Melbourne. Incorrect information indeed."
"You need to be cautious of snakes and dogs, but I’ve never heard of an issue with spiders. If you live near a waterway or bushland then snakes are a real threat during summer, including in suburbia. Tick are in Victoria, but along the coastal area. I’ve had 2 dogs get a paralysis tick in Gippsland so they are definitely around."
But has your Vet advised you to take the precautions suggested by Ozziewander LOstris?And my reading of the info about ticks in Melbourne is that the dog probably picked them up elsewhere. Not locally in Melbourne.

"I'd like to put in a good word for backyard chickens, they eat many of the scary creatures and pests. Once I found out we had funnel webs in the area, it was get chickens or build a moat. :)"
Stephen melbourne residents do put their dogs in their cars and take them east of the Dividing Range as did L0stris and is what is being suggested by the articles I have read about ticks on dogs in Melbourne.
"Nozzie my vet recommended tick treatment if we were going Bush anywhere, but noted that they are most prevalent along coastal areas. We go Bush camping a lot all over victoria so my 2 Goldie’s get a tick and flea treatment that covers them."
"Fair enough, I still think its very alarmist to tell someone they need tick treatment in suburban Melbourne.And re chickens. Our neighbours on both sides in suburban Adelaide have tried to keep chickens and both have given up after losing around 20 chickens to foxes. In fact one neighbour's very large dog almost died after attacking the fox and getting his bites infected,And neighbours have also lost both a dog and two cats to snakebite but not spiders."
"""Our neighbours on both sides in suburban Adelaide have tried to keep chickens and both have given up after losing around 20 chickens to foxes.They should have built fox proof chook house. A family member has a bush property in Gippsland. They keep chickens and have never lost one to foxes or to anything else."
Yeah they do have a fox proof shed and yard but they were letting the chooks out during the day and our urban foxes are absolutely fearless and will come right up to the house even during the day.A fox proof enclosure has to be roofed as well because as other friends found foxes can actually climb a fence up to 2 meters high.
"Sorry nozzle, I didn’t think I was being ‘alarmist’ in mentioning the very real situation regarding ticks. If anything I thought I was assuring the OP that his animals would be fine! Having lived in NSW, VIC AND NT, I take tick prevention very seriously for my hairy friends. Just out of interest...what was the other ‘misinformation’today as I seems your tick knowledge was wrong."
it was misinformation about weather.
"Crikey! Don't worry about the spiders but we seem to be raising pets to feed the foxes, snakes, ticks and possibly drop bears! Crikey! The OP must think we live in a jungle. :P"
And that misinformation was about weather in PNG on the Sydney forum. Several of us commented on the heat in PNG fora question about trips out of Sydney and were told by miss know it all that it can get cold in the PNG highlands at night. I have never been and never want to go to PNG but my sister said this morning that Port Moresby was one of the hottest places she has ever visited admittedly on a cruise so not in the Highlands.
"Well I may or may not be ""miss know it all"" but unlike others who were commenting I HAVE been there.Port Moresby maybe hot at times but it certainly wasn't when we were there. And most people who take tours (other than cruises) to PNG do go to the Highlands which are quite cool all year round and even sometimes have snow."
"""Crikey! The OP must think we live in a jungle. :P""--------------------------Yeh, but isn't anyone going to mention the Drop Bears epidemic?Edited: 2 years ago "
"We need to learn not to feed the ticks, spiders, snakes, chickens, dogs, or the trolls, folks. :) Do you want to give pleasure to these creatures? I most definitely do not.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Seeing as the post has gotten off topic, I'll try to answer your last questions:""I was wondering how common it was to see a dangerous spider indoors in the Melbourne area, and if it was a common thing for indoor animals to get bitten by said dangerous spiders?""Very, very rare. I live in a more ""outback"" type area and although we may see one or two spiders a year inside the house, they are not dangerous. It is very common for people to have pets here and I don't know of one person who has had a pet die or become ill from a spider bite.As posted above though, Australia's quarantine laws re bringing in animals are very strict and you would need to really consider if having them in quarantine is in their best interests. http://www.agriculture.gov.au/cats-dogsEdited: 2 years ago "
"Info on funnel webs and pets from the Australian Museum<<The Australian funnel-web spiders are among the deadliest spiders in the world in the effect their bites have on humans and our primate relations (although the bite has little effect on dogs and cats). There are many species of funnel-web spiders in Australia but only male Sydney Funnel-webs have caused human deaths. There have been only 13 deaths recorded from male Sydney Funnel-webs, but up to 30-40 people are bitten by funnel-web spiders each year. Mouse spiders may have venom that is as toxic as that of some funnel-webs, as some patients have had severe reactions to their bites, although no-one has been recorded as having died from the effects of a mouse spider bite. Antivenoms are available for both funnel-web and Redback Spider bites.>>"
Link Luigi? Sounds entertaining.
"I have had cats for 50 years. All, except one, have died of old age. The current cat is now coming up to 9 years old and my previous one was 14 year old when it died. The one that did not live to old age was about 6 years old but it was killed by dogs.I live in a rural city."
"Well actually, it WAS Nozzie who was referred to as ""miss know it all"". But I'm not sure she's a ""miss"". Maybe that should have been ""ms know it all"".Edited: 2 years ago "
"One mis-statement (well, one amongst several) but this one with respect to the Huntsman spider NOT being venomous. In fact it is. Whilst not considered ‘dangerous’ per se, Huntsman spiders give bites that have caused prolonged pain, inflammation, headache, vomiting and irregular pulse rate. I mistakenly thought the same thing and only discovered the truth after popping one into my mouth, I discovered that a bite causing inflammation/swelling of the tongue or throat could have been very serious indeed... oh well, you live and learn... if you’re lucky!Edited: 2 years ago "
"Filbee, What on God's green earth induced you to do that? Were you perhaps about 33 sheets to the wind?Edited: 2 years ago "
"I am not sure that anybody that wants to pop a spider into their mouth, is sane enough to know what type of spider it is, lol.Edited: 2 years ago "
"When I lived in Melbourne we used to get quite a few huntsmen in the house. They generally would just mind their own business, never really came in close contact with us. However, one of my kids has been bitten by one, just a little bite, swelling but nothing else happened. OP i think you have nothing to worry about at all."
"It’s a long story but although I was completely sober at the time, I was a uni student. The nuns always used to ell me to identify god’s purpose for my life... it may be that I have been placed on this earth principally to serve as a salutary lessons to others?Edited: 2 years ago "
It is good that you are only a Darwin award nominee and not a winner. ;)
"Useless information for the day....I read somewhere... ?.....that the huntsman spider is in fact our most deadly! It just doesn’t have enough venom to be ‘dangerous’. Filbee you were indeed lucky....and stupid....but you were a uni student, say no more. Any other random things you feel like sharing? Lol"
