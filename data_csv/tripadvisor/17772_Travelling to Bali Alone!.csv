"Hi! I'm a 19 year old male travelling to Bali alone for 2 weeks in October this year. I've just a few questions to ask and some general advice relating to traveling alone considering I've never been this far away from home by myself. any help/advice would be appreciated!I'll be doing 9 days in Bali, then to Lombok for the rest.My main priority is not getting bored so any suggestions on plenty of things to do would be amazing. Also what is the weather normally like in October time? Are there normally many solo travelers in Bali or is it primarily just travelers in couples/groups?As I said, any suggestions/advice that relate to travelling alone would be great!"
"<My main priority is not getting bored> My personal belief is that ""boredom"" comes from yourself, not your location. Why did you pick Bali? There must be a reason it interested you enough to plan this trip. Get a guidebook. Upon arrival talk to people. Your trip is your own, doesn't matter what other people are doing, or if other people are couples or groups. There's always some solo travelers anywhere you go.As far as advice... take a book, load your kindle, put favorite music on your iPod, buy a magazine at the airport. In case for some strange reason you are just too bored to fill 9 days in Bali ;-)Get on the Bali forum here on Trip Advisor and see if there are any Meet-Ups going on, or other similar-minded solo travelers you could meet for drinks or dinner.safe travels, suzeEdited: 2 years ago "
"Things to do -I would ask this on the Bali forum. For solo travel, maybe start by reading this https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i12…"
"Bali is a fantastic destination, which is why I'm sure you booked it. The area around Kuta is particularly popular with younger people due to the surf schools. You've probably already read about Ubud & I can hand on heart say it's a fascinating inland part of Bali which caters well for all age groups without selling out it's cultural soul to mass tourism.As Bali is relatively close for travellers from Australia, you can expect the open & friendly charm of the Ozzies to be reflected in a few sports bars & cafes. I found Balinese people to be genuinely delightful hosts, with a warmth and humor that puts travellers at ease. I've no doubt you'll have a memorable trip and would signpost you to the Bali forum for practical info, updates on activities and recommendations on what to see & do."
"I’ve not been to Lombok but been to Bali four times. Only the once solo for a food festival. As suggested already, the Kuta area is popular for your age group, all ages actually. There are a few party hotels if that’s your thing, Bounty comes to mind. I’m sure you’ll find other solo travellers there or groups of friends. Sunset beers on the beach would be a good place to meet new people also. One time there with friends we picked up a stray from the US at the beach and dragged him along for a meal and (more than) a few drinks after. I’ve been in November, start of wet season, but the weather was still quite good. Hot as usual but not too humid. October “should” be fine but it is the tropics so you should always be prepared for rain. You can easily book transport for day trips from the very many drivers touting for business on the streets, expect IDR500-600k for a full day. Or book a shared trip at one of the tour stalls, most will include hotel pick up. If you’re looking into the Gilis at Lombok, there’s a thread on the Lombok forum you may want to read. Something like “Gili T is a dump”. Some pretty bad reviews of the island but also a few stating otherwise. I don’t care whether you go or not, just wanted to make you aware the glossy travel brochures aren’t always to be believed. Bali itself isn’t the tropical paradise it’s often made out to be but is still a good spot for a holiday, especially for Aussies as we don’t have to travel too far. Enjoy your trip."
I am travelling to Bali in mid of October (Solo). Looking for a fellow traveler for local trips. You can write to me at oaindrila.banerjee@gmail.com

HiYou may want to review your Lombok trip. Due to recent severe earthquake the place is not in good condition and is facing several problems including Malaria epidemic. So I think its not advisable to go to that side till the whole situation resumes back to normal.
"Hey @maeirah, thank you very much for that insight, Hows the current situation in Lombok,, Is it anyway looking to improvise anytime soon or may be until end of October. And how about Bali -the main city and around.. Is malaria Epidemic there as well??"
"I have booked a last minute trip for Bali for 10 days, I've seen things to do on youtube which helped me a little. There is absolutely so much to do, so I've only booked an hotel for the day I arrive which is 26th September. There onwards I am booking hostels two to three nights at a time in different locations and take some of the days as they come. I've seen on youtube that Seminyak area has night life, bars, 3o minutes from there (according to google maps) is the famous Kuta beach (in taxi or other public transport). Ubud is also another place that appears to be popular, seems like a lot of greenery, no beaches however. Could do hiking there, there is a coffee plantation. so basically lots of sight seeing things if you are into that.There are also a lot of lovely temples across Bali I think the biggest temple is in Lempuyang: I have a link if anyone wants to view it: bali-indonesia.com/magazine/bali-must-see-te…"
Also travelling to Bali solo in October 5th-11th if anyone wants a meet up? Also any more suggestions of whats good to do when travelling by yourself would be appreciated :)
"Hello Mr.vaibhav, I'll be there from 23rd Oct - 30th at bali., If you have any plans let me know..."
"Hey, long story short I’m now traveling alone. My friend just cancelled on me :(Little nervous now - I’m still going to go! So anyone out who’s there from 7th - 22nd give me a shout"
I am also travelling solo and you can find me at Tonys villas from 7th October if you wish to meetup for dinner . sandy
"Hi Srilekha, I hope you have reached Bali and all is well with recent tremors. I have plan for 13th Oct. Please let me know if it is safe. May be we can catch up while I am there"
"Hi, it's the same story with me. If you are in Bali, please reply on the safety."
"Hi Swam, there is always potential for seismic and/or volcanic activity in much of Indonesia and Bali is no exception. Any reports of current conditions will have no bearing on tomorrow, next week, next year....... one hour from now. You can stay home or you can go and enjoy your holiday and more than likely come home unscathed."

Anyone travelling to Bali from 28th Sep to 6th Oct 2019?Edited: 1 year ago 
"Hello, I am looking for recommendations, I will be in Ubud Sept 20-25, and lm looking for accommodations, thanks!"
"@Sayma….You are posting on a 1 year old thread & it's extremely unlikely that the original poster will reply.As you are asking about recommended accommodation in Ubud, I suggest you use the Bali forum to seek accommodation by clicking on the drop down hotels menu at the top of the forum page.You can then read the most recent reviews of travellers & more importantly, see their photo's. The accommodation reviews can be filtered down to ones from solo travellers You can then decide whether to book the accommodation via a 3rd party web based booking agent, or directly with the accommodation provider. Personally, I booked directly when I went to Ubud but I can't remember if I had to pay a deposit or not."
