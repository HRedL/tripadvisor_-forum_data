I’m asking in a new spot because that other Coronavirus post got too crazy for my tasteI purchased our trip in November for a mid April Cancun trip. Our airfare is with southwest so I can get that back IF we cancel if it spreads in Cancun or just is plain out too crazy here in the US. But our all inclusive at the paradisus Playa del Carmen is not refundable. Does anyone know if there is an insurance I can buy now that would help get some of the cost back if we decided to cancel? Obviously I’d try to see if the hotel would just honor a future travel date. I’m not expecting my money back. I want to go at some point but I’m trying to just plan ahead.
"I don't think I've ever seen a travel policy that allowed you to purchase it more than a week two from the trip purchase date. I know thats likely not what you want to hear, and its possible that something you're looking for exists, but in 10 years of purchasing travel policies I've only seen up to two weeks from the purchase date allowed."
"Did you book directly with the resort? If you did, Paradisus Playa del Carmen has free cancellation up to 24 hours before arriving at the resort."
I bought the non refundable option directly from them (I don’t ever trust Expedia) HOWEVER I called and they are now offering a credit to use for 1 year due to people being nervous over the virus. I’m not canceling my trip yet since it’s 6 weeks from now but I have huge peace of mind now that I can change it to later in the year
"Albeit you probably will not qualify for/cannot buy ""cancel for any reason insurance"" at this time, I recommend that you buy medical insurance that covers your foreign destination. It's really cheap. I just ran a search on insuremytrip.com and found several secondary medical insurance options for less than $60 (for 3 people) using my upcoming trip as an example. The criteria for purchasing cancel for any reason was that you purchase on the date of, or prior to the date of final payment for you trip. Having said that, most people do not realize that it may not cover prior known risks of definite certainty... like Corona virus. Most certainly do not cover pandemics."
"If you are from Canada (not that it helps you, but might others), you can still buy cancellation insurance (Manulife) and be covered as it's not an advisory to not travel to Cancun yet. If it becomes an advisory to not travel you would be covered. I double checked before I just bought mine and they confirmed."
"Add suggest that you call the insurance company and ask them, and then ask them to send you the documents and you read them very carefully before you buy. Generally travel insurance should be bought within a certain time period of you purchasing the first expense related to the trip. You have now discovered fly that’s a good idea and what you’re doing is much more difficult."
"THat may be true in the US, but in CAnada it can be bought at any time. The only thing about buying later is the portion that's cancel for any reason won't be valid unless the policy is bought within 72 hours, but all other parts of the insurance including cancellation can be bought at any time. Of course the pre existing conditions start from when it's bought."
This is a little off subject but I am going May 2nd and wanting to buy health insurance for my trip. I have never done this before so I don’t know where to start it hopefully someone can point me in the right direction. I am just about to search this forum. I called the travel insurance Allianz and they would only let me purchase it while booking travel not after. However; they did give our money back when we were booked to Cabo when a hurricane was coming. They had to have an article from the National Hurricane Center emailed to them with the warning and not just a watch listed. The hotel allowed us to reschedule the trip.
I have been using Alianze for years primarily for medical & med evac coverage. We fly alot using reward points so I am not usually concerned about trip cost. I buy directly thru their website & you can purchase insur as late as 24 hours before departure I think. I did make a claim w/them in Sept 2017 due to a tropical storm in Cabo. Harvey hit Houston where my daughter lives & I had purchased her air ticket which American refunded but trip insur covered everything else with no problems.
"I dont' know if it's the same in the US as Canada for medical, but we can purchase right up to the last minute. Even same day as departure."
"We just purchased trip insurance last week for an early spring trip. You can purchase almost any time prior to your trip. It will exclude cancel for any reason and won’t pay for preexisting conditions unless purchased within a short window of booking your trip. Still, we now have medical coverage beyond the emergency care provided by our private insurance and evaluation coverage. It also provides coverage for cancellations due to illness and a short list of other reasons. We evaluated plans on insuremytrip.com."
Most insurance companies are not reimbursing - even with trip insurance - because it is an epidemic which is not covered.
