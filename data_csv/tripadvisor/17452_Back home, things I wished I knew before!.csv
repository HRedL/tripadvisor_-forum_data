Laughing at the restroom comment :-) p.s. I totally agreeEdited: 6 years ago 
I REALLY enjoyed your post!
Nice TR glad you had a good time as for the restroom you need room to escape if your door gets stuck.
"Love it :-) and totally agree with the restroom comment ;-)Love the tip comment as you are on holiday, all is well with the world and a 20% tips is a great idea as we are all in a great mood in Orlando :-)"
Brilliant post. Really enjoyed reading this.:)
I love their restrooms. Except the ones in the I drive Outlets. They were rank.Pleased you had an amazing time.
"Lovely post, can we have more please?"
You certainly did a lot of unnecessary worrying lolGlad you had a great holiday Very informative TR especially for 1st timers
"Not only is there a 2ft gap under the restroom door but there's also a 1"" gap down the hinged edge - perfect for small, curious children to be able to stare at you whilst you're enthroned!"
loved it and all true great report
"Brilliant! :-) Loved your post and definitely agree with the restroom comments! Never forget my first visit to an American restroom in Sanford!! That 1"" side gap caused me such stress!! Lol!Glad you had a fantastic time"
"Great report, thanks, gave me a chuckle :)"
"Love your list! Here's a few answers to the bathroom issue and Oldiesguy is right...You need room to escape if the lock gets stuck (been there done that...still feel grimey years later). :-))Rather than peep through the gaps on side of door...it's more polite to just look down for shoes when trying to find an empty stall. It would be a little creepy if you had to bend too low to take a glance. :-)) I know someone is thinking...the door is closed, so it must be occupied. Perhaps not...refer back to the stuck lock.If you see shoes...you have the option of not parking yourself right next door. Need room for neighbor to pass you some paper (shortages tend to happen) without having it touch the floor. I must admit...I have no idea why those seats are so darn low! Can't find any logic there. :-))"
Thank you for a great afternoon laugh. Great post.
"Lol so much, loved your thoughts! Was laughing at your restroom comment but then more so when the 1 inch gap was mentioned! So true!"
"Great report, really enjoyed reading. Will put a lot of first timers at ease too!"
"Fun list of things you wished you knew - now that you did all that worrying, I don't have to...!!! Glad you had a great trip, and thanks for the list!!!How did you get the 'icons' at the bottom of your post? Thnx :)"
"I had a bit of a rough day and this made me smile, thank you! :DIm looking forward to that 2 ft gap under the door... I get paranoid even with the smallest gap! Ahhhh"
"Great post. Very funny and all true especially not seeing the server again once you have paid. Our server once forgot she had already buttered us up for the tip and told me numerous times how much she liked my top, each time as if it was the first time we had spoken lol. Glad you enjoyed."
Love the toilet comment! It left plenty of room for my sister to wind me up including grabbing my ankle whilst I was trying to hover over the loo with everyone who walked past peering in the gap!!!
Lol great review were going on Dreamliner next year staying at rosen point so was great to hear u loved it can I ask did Thomson call to offer to upgrade u to premium ? And how much was it per person ? X
"Very informative (& funny) post, handy for us first timers. Thanks for the chuckle :-)"
once again referring to the gap under the rest room doors..on last hols a friend had a small child stick their head under her door to say hello!!!!
"As everyone ekse said great report nice to read something different, and funny.Also glad we cleared up the 2 foot gap mystery!"
"As an American, I can truly say I have never, ever, seen an adult peering through the gap by the side of the door, and in my decades of life on earth, have only had one child peer in at me. The gap at the bottom is to lower the cost of building the enclosures...because there really is no seeing anything but your shoes unless someone is actually lying on the floor.You do all realize that Americans go to Europe and wonder about why they go to the expense of creating a floor-to-ceiling cell...and that there must be some awfully pervy people in Europe if they have to create a sealed-off chamber so no one can peek....and that everyone must be awfully tall if all those toilets are so high off the floor....right?"

"If someone can see your smalls, you're doing something seriously wrong -- why do your smalls need to be on the floor, or even on your feet? I'd be more concerned about whatever nastiness was on the floor getting onto my smalls (and therefore onto my skin) than anyone seeing the insides of my smalls. Toilet floors are filthy places, frequently wet, and always dirty -- spray from the toilets, whatever people have dragged in on their feet, anything that might have overflowed...yuck.You really don't see the cost savings in eliminating 2 feet of unneeded construction materials?The overall laugh is that the rest of the world laughs at Americans for being prudish."
Lol - I've always found the gaps around the doors very strange. It seems freaky being able to see the people outside your stall while you're sitting on the throne. We have the same here in Australia. Build doors that fit already!!!
"Surely one foot would do?Sorry I have not yet mastered the art of keeping my trousers and smalls off the floor ,whilst sitting on the ""John""Now! There may be a market for a stool to rest your smalls and trousers on."
Love the original post. Now also loving gapgate.
"Excellent TR....brilliant, and so useful for newbies.Good to hear the positives on the Dreamliner, as a few negatives on here sometimes.We always rent a car.....but, we've been a child-free couple for a few years now and its great to have the freedom.The restroom discussion - ahhhhh, there have been many on here re: the big gap, but hey ho, we're in the wonderful US so I just accept their ways (they must feel claustrophobic in ours) lolThanks again for sharing your thoughts."
"Great TR! Glad you had a good time!If you're worried about our public bathrooms, wait till you visit China. Often no doors, half walls & no ""throne"" LOLOh, I forgot to mention ... no paper ;-)Edited: 6 years ago "
lol....China is OFF my bucket list now thanks mjoe (not that it was ever on)....ewwww and yuck.
"People let their clothes touch public bathroom floors? Gross! I hate that my shoes have to touch them! I've never had to crawl out of a locked bathroom, but no, Ollie, I don't think one foot would be enough space for the average person.I don't recall anyone ever staring at me through a gap, though I do think some of them are excessively large. But I know that once I see a flash of clothing as I walk by one I don't stop to investigate further, so it doesn't seem that big a problem to me. But in any country, as long as they're clean, decent-smelling and stocked with soap and toilet paper (and preferably free instead of requiring payment), I have no complaints.OP, glad you had a nice trip."
"Lol, Thankyou all so much for your positive comments, looks like Gapgate is really hotting up haha, but thanks soooo much for the China tip, that's one place my conveniences would be very inconvenient ;)"
... Chinagate... ! My friend has just come back from touring china and she says that there's often just a hole in the ground and well used foot grooves in the front and these foot grooves are often wet and sloppy (gross gross ). You have to be very careful you don't slip into the carsey !! American restrooms are a blessing in that case....

"Glad you had a good time. I enjoyed your report and agree with you on most things, except for the currency card. Is this the only form of payment you brought with you? I would never rely on just the one card because stuff does happen sometimes. Also I am a worrywart! We always bring the big 3 with us: cash (most of which is well hidden in hubby's zippered money belt), bank debit cards and credit cards. That way if one thing doesn't work or gets lost or stolen our holiday is not totally ruined."
"Wow! I've just returned to this thread, 24 hours after my original post and I'm amused to find that I'm responsible for creating 'Gapgate'! Sorry if anyone took offense; there was no implied criticism of U.S. building regulations, money-saving strategies or voyeurism! Shall I throw another thing into the mix?...the U.S.A.is the only country where I've seen toilet seat-shaped protective paper covers. How do you folks feel about that one?"
"In reply to gsrtraveller don't worry, we also took cash and a debit card, I did read all the ""my card didn't work, don't take them!!!"" threads ;)"
"GapGate- I love it lol. Have lived in all 3 countries mentioned (ie us, UK and france.For sunshine""As an American, I can truly say I have never, ever, seen an adult peering through the gap by the side of the door, and in my decades of life on earth, have only had one child peer in at me. The gap at the bottom is to lower the cost of building the enclosures...because there really is no seeing anything but your shoes unless someone is actually lying on the floor.You do all realize that Americans go to Europe and wonder about why they go to the expense of creating a floor-to-ceiling cell...and that there must be some awfully pervy people in Europe if they have to create a sealed-off chamber so no one can peek....and that everyone must be awfully tall if all those toilets are so high off the floor....right?""I have also never had a person look thru the gap, but do wonder why they do the whole build a seperate chamber with fortified door, but then don't have an ACTUAL toilet but just a few 'foot' placements and a great big hole in the ground (That you feel you might fall into if you are small enough lol).  After all, In France men don't ever stop to pee at service stations, only women do . Men just pull over, get out, drop their pants and pee anywhere they like- it is the french way ;-)"
"Larry ""Wide Stance"" Craig peeked through the crack of the door on the stall. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Craig_scandal"
"Oh dear, Orlando_Vic - this discussion just went down the pan...!"
"Larry Craig wouldn't have given a tinker's damn about seeing anyone's smalls -- he wasn't in the ladies' having a peek, he was looking for a romantic liaison in the mens'.Edited: 6 years ago "
Such a fun post!!! Canada also has US style ladies bathrooms - so it was interesting to read all of your comments. Anyone that is aghast at our bathrooms - just a word of warning - China isn't the only country with holes in the floor. ANY third world country is not going to be up to North American standards. My daughter lives in China and travels the world extensively. Her biggest beef is all the holes in the floor in third world countries. She'd love a North American toilet when she travels. Her biggest word of advise when travelling in third world countries - if you want a decent bathroom stay in a 5 star hotel. Most build their toilets to first world standards. If you can get over your squeamishness - there is a beautiful world to discover.
"I've been florida 14 times and also fly with virgin and I think peasant is not a nice word to use, it seems like u have confidence issues, your no better then any one other holiday makers. You should be more humble because some family's save for years for a holiday in florida ""respect"" spring to mind...."
"Or... You could be in the toilet stall in Japan when the little cleaning lady opens the door and cleans around you, and this is the men's room."
"happily, Amanx, while squat toilets still exit all across France, they're starting to decline in number. (and there's almost always a commode in the handicapped stall, if there is one).I'll agree with all, though, that those are reserved for only the most dire of emergencies."
This has got to be the funniest post ever... Just my sense of humour... Oh and I love the little protective covers in some of the places in the US .... I actually sit down. And with that gross thought in your head... Ek...
"I remember being bewildered by the vending machines containing 'napkins' in the ladies' restrooms when I first visited Orlando. Needing an emergency nappy for my baby, I used the machine and was very surprised with what was dispensed! I soon realised that the word 'diaper' was what I was actually looking for!In the U.K. 'napkins' are used to protect your clothes from food at the dinner table and to delicately dab your lips once you've finished dining!"
The expression ''two countries divided by a common language'' springs to mind and it also seems that we're divided by other differences such as toilet door design!
Always remember the automatic paper seat covers that whizz around the toilets that made me laugh...
"the paper ""butt gaskets"" have yet to be proven to be effective at blocking disease (and what's the last time you read about an epidemic of butt rash....?) but if they make you feel better...."
"Lol, I too have returned to this thread and I am smiling away! For what it's worth I love the paper seat covers and think the UK should invest in those too! Still not convinced about the gaps though, I have also had small children look under the door!"
"and a child small enough to peek under the gap causes what harm? Your naughty bits are on the toilet...you're worried about a toddler seeing your bare knees? Toilets are gender-specific in the US -- you're in a room with people of the same gender as you, which means that they probably have exactly the same bits that you do (so they probably don't really have any desire to see yours)...and kids young enough to be accompanied into a toilet for the opposite gender are pretty unlikely to post on Facebook that they saw some tourist's thighs.It's. just. a. toilet. Do what you need to do and go enjoy what you're on vacation to see and do."
I once had the seven dwarfs come barging under my cubicle door in Orlando airport.
"ohhh, the humanity! amazing that you've recovered enough to talk about it!"
There is no other place to holiday than Florida...been so many times lost count...The restrooms...I had food poisoning on year...didn't know until I got home...anyways...I was on the toilet dying and this kid has his head under the door...plus you have keep hold of your knickers so they don't touch the floor LOL!!!The automatic flush is awesome and the seat covers are a great idea...2012 was first time I had driven...I was terrified but it was great except crazy drivers who don't use a indicator...cut in front of you...don't let you in...2013...I was just as bad...I always fly Premium First Choice...Dreamliner wasn't in service in April...it is worth the extra money???Hate getting back into Manchester Airport...miserable staff...always raining...it is like a Third World Country...no auto flushing toilets but at least they won't see my draws!!!!
"No more unusual than you coming on here ""constantly"" (do you understand what that word means?) and dismissing another country for no reason other than it's not the same as they are ""back home"" -- particularly a developed country with indoor plumbing WITH enclosures AND a toilet (not a hole in the floor).Different doesn't mean better or worse -- it simply means not the same. Adapting to different is a key part of traveling.First world problem in every sense of the word. You're fortunate enough to be able to travel abroad and all you can comment on is the condition of the toilets? What did you do on your holidays? What actual American culture did you encounter (because the fibreglass world of Disney is NOT American culture)?Did you do or see anything you liked, or did the horrible short toilets (cleaned regularly for your comfort), with their gaping 1/2"" spaces traumatise you so horribly that didn't enjoy your trip?Perhaps you should do your obviously fragile constitution some consideration, and never travel anywhere that anything at all will ever be even remotely different than what you're familiar with.Edited: 6 years ago "
"If anyone were to slam all of England and the United Kingdom based solely on the toilets, you'd blow a gasket. Liverpool has been the object of enough derision over the decades that you ought to understand.There will be a sense of humour when backhanding an entire country based on a toilet (a toilet!) is funny.Edited: 6 years ago "
"Thanks amanx.Maybe the thread should be cut now.Bit of a laugh turned sour.Not very informative for anyone is it.,I mean,why are people talking about peeing at service stations and the likes?Madness."
"Seaview,I'm an American who finds your post totally hilarious! Most of all the Ponderosa comment. You have that one pegged perfectly. As for the restroom comment, it is nice to have something that is so normal to us be pointed out. All my life restrooms have had basically the same type of divider and crack in the door type set ups. I have never paid enough attention while traveling to realize there was other designs when it comes to public restrooms. It was basically for ease of cleaning up the floor and security of being able to see if someone was in the restroom while still providing a bit of privacy. That said, in the last several years, many establishments have started building solid wall dividers with solid doors with no cracks to peek thru. However, most of these still have the door cut off to where there is still a large gap @ the bottom. Don't let the baiters on here upset you, it's a great post, no insults indicated and no offense taken by this American. Glad you had a great trip."
Excuse me. Not a baiter. And it wasn't me who made it personal -- but my finding the statements offensive (and let's be honest -- the OP was not the worst of the bunch) is no more or less valid than your NOT finding them offensive.Another key part of traveling is doing your best to not purposely offend others...sometimes it's entirely by accident....but continuing to poke once someone has indicated offence is uncalled for.Edited: 6 years ago 
"Hooley dooley some people seriously need to chill out!!!I can honestly say that our toilets here in Aus have a variety of set ups most of which have been covered here on this thread...well except for the hole in the floor ;) I've encountered that numerous times in Asia though & although I'm not a fan, it's their way. Here we could enter a public restroom & have an inch gap at bottom or a foot, you just never know. I really enjoyed the OP & had a good giggle. I've since then had a laugh at some other comments & just how sensitive some people can be!!! Chill out guys...a toilet is a toilet!!"
Maybe all these kids in America who seem to keep peeking under the stall doors of people from the UK are just fascinated by the sound of British grunting!
Jeeze - let it go will you No need to be insulting
"Ok,So, ive read this post with a smile on my face and now it's into toilet humour (my favourite), what i would like to know is?The toilet seats have a cut out in the front in the gents, not sure if youladies have the same, but.......why is it there, or really why is the bit missing?......Now, in design i could imagine them thinking we'll remove this bit of the seat to avoid......."" contact""....Really,i knowthey say everything in the states is bigger n better......well, looking down, i'm no where near, I know theres bragging rights, but come on........By the way, this is meant as humour......Trill"
"Yes, the ladies' also frequently has the ""horseshoe"" seat...you're not the first person to visit the US and ask the question. I've posed it to other Americans, because I don't know...and nobody else knows, either!"
Because it's cheaper than a whole seat. ;-)
"Lol great report and tips .....I love the restroom comment still laughing at that, I have been 7 times and still don't understand the cubicles so weird. We have children but could never have imagined not doing Disney to be honest we the adults love it more than my kids. So the next time you go you must try it. Thanks for the morning laugh :)"
"Thank you for a great post, much like you i am a worrier and will be flying out friday to Orlando.I must remember its a holiday not a quest for the Holy grail lol x,"
