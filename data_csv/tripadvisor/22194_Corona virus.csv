Is it safe to travel to the Philippines from Australia with the corona virus in the Philippines

The question should be is it safe to travel to Australia due to the Coronavirus. More cases per capita in Australia.Read the “sticky” top of the page for official websites rather than ask members of a travel forum.
"If you're going to Cebu, currently still safe."
