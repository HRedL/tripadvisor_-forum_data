"Based on comments about driving in the park at night, would it also be inadvisable to drive from IDA to Jackson after an 8PM arrival in September?"
We go to IF a few times a year for shopping (closest WalMart). We always try to get home before dusk. There are large numbers of deer on stretches of the road in Idaho. I also don't like driving Teton Pass in the dark. I'd suggest that you make the trip the following morning.
Thoughr that might be the case. I was hoping to avoid an additional hotel/motel change. Bedbug paranoia after a $3k exterminator job.
We loved the Hilton garden inn there. Very clean.
"Since I see you have some reviews under your belt I know you know to check the TA reviews. These are a mixed blessing, but if someone mentions bedbugs I usually steer clear unless it definitely sounds like a bogus review.Pam"
"Pam, we dont even know if we got them from any hotel. Exrreminator said it is almost epidemic. A recent check of NYC subways found them all over. He even saw one ona woman's shoulder in a car dealtership!"
"Oh my word. Certainly not a problem I have heard of occurring in Idaho. Big critters like wolves and bears yes, little critters maybe not so much. Hopefully they are all getting their little tails frozen with all the winter you all are having."
What time is dusk in that part of the world in late September?
