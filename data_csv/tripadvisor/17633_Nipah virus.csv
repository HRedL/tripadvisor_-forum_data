"Hi I was planning to visit Munnar, Thekkady and kumarakom from 5th June but as the news of nipah virus outburst I'm a bit confused. Any one have idea of the situation in Munnar and surrounding area about this condition?"
"I too am planning a trip with my wife and kid to Munnar in early June.. while the news south and central Kerala are not affect and this is contained within Kozikhode, next few days will clarify the situation"
"sir I am planning to to to Munnar i am little bit confused regarding ""Nipah"" epidemic any body have idea of the situation in Munnar and surrounding area about this condition? is it safe to go ahead as my itinerary"
From what I read this virus so far is confined to Calicut districtMunnar is more than 400 kms from Calicut You may want to wait for a few days to see if it spreads and you can rebook accordingly
Hopefully picture will be clear in coming week.
"We are also going to kochi and alleppey in first week of june, please keep everyone posted if you get any info."
Nipah as on date is confirmed in two districts of Northern Kerala and around 11 have died.
Hi we have our tickets booked for Munnar to periyar to allepey to kovalam....will it be safe to visit kerela from 8-15 june on account of nipah virus?
"Things would be more clear in a week or so about how worse is the impact .Currently the official confirmation is of 11 deaths in two districts of Northern Kerala ie, Kozhikode and malappuram"
There is no confirmation about other places. Please wait a week to understand its reach
Hello We have our tickets booked for Munnar on 29th May kindly suggest to travel or not as we are traveling with 1year kid Thanks in advance ☺
One thing of relative comfort is that it is Kerala where this virus event is happening - probably head and shoulders the best large enough populated state in India with public health. Most other states would have struggled far worse with a serious event like this.Nearly 2 days with no new infection so far in the state. Mangalore may have one case confirmed though by tomorrow caught from the same Kozhikode hospital where the initial deaths took place.
I am also considering to reschedule my visit due to this virus attack.
I think you should postpone your tripWhy take chances since you will be traveling with a young kid
It looks like the infection is only on the areas in and around kozhikode. I am travelling tomorrow to munnar ash's have been informed that it is safe to go to kochi and munnar. Kerala state govt issued notice that it is safe
"Hi,From the recent updates the NIPAH virus is very much under control and moreover this problem is limited to a very small area in the northern part of Kerala which is not anywhere near to Munnar & Thekkady. Only thing you should taken care of is do not try Toddy from local toddy shops.Please refer the link thehindu.com/news/…article23971898.eceCheers, TonyEdited: 2 years ago "
Update if you reached Munnar... Thanks
"In relation to my post #11 on this thread about patient in Mangalore, test results have come in today and the patient has not tested positive to the virus. That is a very good piece of news.My feeling is that Kerala's public/social health system has been doing a tremendous job in isolating and quarantining the linkages; all states in India should be grateful that the first cases were in the state Kerala who had the wherewithals to take on a little understood but dangerous virus and who may stop the progress of an epidemic on it's tracks.I remember SARS in 2002-2003 which started in South East Asia and China. Even developed countries with good medical systems like Canada can get clueless for a while on how to contain the spread of the new epidemic. Canada had 44 deaths from SARS. Only as recently as in 2017, have scientists located the natural reservoir of the SARS virus - again a bat - the horseshoe bat in remote caves in Yunnan province in China."

"Sir, The affected areas is nearer to Bengaluru than Munnar. Please decide yourself ;-)"
I also have book my package tour to munnar& aleppy.the distance from munnar& kozikode(nipah affected dist)is 233.9 km.so I think if u take proper protection your tour will be successfull.
Any specific protection we should take other than not eating fruits Nd staying away from infected area

Munnar is far away from the infected area...more than 200kms..this has been only infected in some location in calicut and not spreaded outside near by places.. without any second thought u can plan munner
Hi all I have completed my 5 days trip to Munnar and must say it was a great experience. No need of getting panic for nipah virus in these areas at all.
"Hi,I have booked my trip from sep 29th to 2nd oct 2018 for Munnar and club mahindra and today i have called all the nearby resorts and Locates staying over there from resort via phone call is it safe to travel .everyone is giving single answer that """" Our area is not atoll effected as it is hill station and in munnar some of Slope area were effected due to flood but when you talk about Disease we dont see such things here and only 2 states of Kerala are effected MALLAPURAM / CALICUT were11 people died because of it''' .This is my suggestion and needful to all fellow travelers who are travelling by this month or next month"
