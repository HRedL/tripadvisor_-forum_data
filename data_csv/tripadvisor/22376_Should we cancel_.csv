"Booked into a Nuevo Vallarta all-inclusive for a week, arriving this coming Monday, one parent travelling with 2 kids (9 and 13). Do you think it's responsible to travel next week, or should I stay home?So far, the travel booker has been unwilling to refund or reschedule."
How does your Cancellation Insurance policy read?
"Really only you can answer the travel or not question. Doesn't sound like you have ""high risk"" issues so I'd be less concerned about personal illness and more concerned about bringing something back to loved ones who might be at risk. Also, who knows what kind of travel restrictions the government will dream up. Lots of unhappy people having a hard time getting back to the US (you don't say where you're from) from Europe and paying a fortune if they can find flights. The decision is more fraught with possible pitfalls than normal so your tolerance for being able to roll with the punches is what you need to assess. Possible it'll all go smoothly but there are definitely some potential surprises. I'd always rather face a crisis at home than if a foreign country - that's just me though.Edited: 10:18 am, March 13, 2020 "
"Thanks for the reply - but that's not really why I was asking. I will work that out with my travel agent...My question is really more on whether people feel it's the right thing to do to travel with kids at this time.I'm really not overly concerned with getting the virus there. I understand that our chances of getting it there may be less than here in Canada... Even if we did get it, I think we would be fine. The kids especially are at very low risk of getting seriously ill. I'd much rather spend next week on the beach than here. But there could be issues around travel restrictions, being quarantined upon return or in Mexico, etc. that make it a harder choice... And most importantly, we do not want to spread the virus, and the federal government here is is announcing today that people should cancel non-essential international travel."
"Only you can make that call.My own concerns were more about going thru the airports, general panic and hysteria among other people, possible implementation of closures or quarantines or flight cancellations... not really about getting sick myself or spreading the virus.What is your home city? That could make a difference too."
"I am leaning towards staying home. It's heartbreaking - I saved up for this, and the schools here are closing for two weeks AFTER March break - so kids will be bouncing off the walls, would be so much nicer to spend a week of that on the beach. I know this whole thing is going to have much worse effects on others who depend on travellers like us and I shouldn't complain. Still sucks."
Suze - those are my chief concerns too. Travelling from Toronto.
So sorry about your trip cancellation. Difficult after looking forward to it but you sound like a great parent. Hopefully you can reschedule for this summer.
"If you decide not to go maybe you can you dig into this again with your ""travel broker"". I know most of the airlines have changed policy over the situation.My non-refundable Saver ticket (normally absolutely no changes or refunds allowed) on Alaska Air, has a new policy in place because of this where you could cancel and receive a credit voucher good for one year with them."
"Yeah, it's looking more like we should be able to get a credit of some kind to reschedule later. I just got a call from my boss asking if I was cancelling - and saying the company would require that I self-quarantine for 2 weeks on return, even without any symptoms."

I am from Canada.  The government of Canada has advised us not to travel.  Most insurance companies will not cover Covid 19 as its a 'known event My insurance company Blue Cross will not cover Covid 19 if I get sick in Mexico giving the reason it's a 'known event'.
World Nomads covers Covid 19 for US residents. (they do not have a pandemic exclusion).
Dr. Theresa Tam has said Canadians should cancel all non-essential travel.
"We will not travel. Since my initial post, warnings from the Federal Government here in Canada have come against international travel. Thanks for your replies."
"I would suggest you cancel. We planned on visiting PV in March with older teens in tow, but are staying home this year until COVID-19 runs its course. While we'll miss our annual PV fix, it's more important to align with social responsibility, which lends towards containment of the situation. There's always next year!"
"Smart decision, Chris.Cross your fingers these containment measures work and the spread dramatically slows and cases slow way down-eventually. You can go on your trip at a later date."
"solar: Regarding insurance companies not covering issues arriving from covid-19, I don't know about Blue Cross, but Manulife IS covering any issues that come up while traevling as long as you are not in a country that has a level 3 or 4 advisory against it (Mexico is not one)."
"Where do you live? Could you or your children be shedding the virus?Edited: 10:03 pm, March 13, 2020 "
Sorry answered before reading your further responses. Sorry for your cancelled plans.
"Mexico is now a LEVEL 3Edited: 11:08 pm, March 14, 2020 "
And so it begins:  https:/…
"level 3 is over 100-2000...but considering the population of 127 mil...it's still far from many other countries...Edited: 11:22 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"@ Alunelo: the objective of the travel advisories is precisely to keep the numbers as low as possible while containing the outbreak and trying to prevent the further spread of the disease. Don't bring the virus with you and don't bring it back. Covid got spread to close to 130 countries by oblivious visitors who think they are fine...they bring it with them and someone else takes it back to their country. Also, we may have good healthcare but most of the world's population does not have access to this. .The sooner people will heed the travel advisories and general hygiene and behavior precautions the sooner this disease will go away. Look at China: they took drastic measures but it is now working.Edited: 11:53 pm, March 14, 2020 "
W5 a Canadian show explained the possibility of many viruses on the horizon and the need to contain them . China showed the world how to control a pandemic. Post #23 is correct . This would be serious if we thought it was not and did not take precautions.  We had our house sitters stock our fridge and our son dropped off our truck at the airport. We are in a self imposed quarantine and any people returning to Canada mentioned their employers told them not to come to work for 2 weeks paid leave. However leaving now you would be without paid leave. China went so far as to have people check your temperature and other symptoms if you so much as left your apartment. They closed factories. Without getting into the politics of the country the quick actions they took brought relieve to this virus.  W 5 show described that there are many viruses that will prevail due to many reasons from global warming to environmental polution. The scientists can't really predict what is next but they can suggest what steps to take to minimize people from contracting them. As someone said the best way is to simply wash your hands like you just cleaned a bag of jalapeno peppers.
"We live in PV. I don’t know about Nuevo but beaches are closed north and south of here. Even tho’ u don’t mind getting the virus, you could all return asymptomatic and pass it on. I personally think traveling anywhere non-essential is dicey, especially with kids. You are in an all-inclusive but not sure how that will look....not business as usual. Frankly, as a resident I’m not crazy about tourists returning. Our state has been very proactive, and the residents are complying with policies....and I personally would like to keep it that way. You will have many more years of travel...why now?Edited: 4:43 pm, May 24, 2020 "
You replied to a March thread inquiring about March travel.
