"People abroad have no idea what this means. Acapulco is the A NUMBER ONE Traditional Pilgrimage destination of Mexican society (as Gary Oldman would say, that means EVERYONE) for Semana Santa.Is like the Mecca was quarantined for Hajj. This is huge. Semana Santa is officially canceled."
"Semana Santa was already canceled all over Mexico and Easter is going to be very low key everywhere else in the world if it hasn’t been canceled where you are.Edited: 6:03 pm, April 02, 2020 "
"As much as I lament the devastating effect this is going to have on the city and its citizens, it is the right move. I just hope that people respect this in the name of their families, neighbors and friends. Up into the past weekend I was hearing reports of tour buses still arriving for beach vacations."
ALMO has shut down the brewers. No beer is another reason to stay home.
"AMLO has not shut down anything. This is a mandate from the Health Secretary Sanitary Emergency. If anyone wishes to learn the details, here's the link:https:/…Edited: 9:40 am, April 03, 2020 "
"Mike, I think you might be conflating two articles - AMLO cancelled a brewery construction plan - Constellation brands, after there was another one of those ""popular votes"" (akin to NAICM). Some governors (looking at you, state of Tabasco) have declared alcohol ""non-essential"" and directed stores to stop selling. But there has been no federal stance taken on alcohol that I know about.Edited: 10:51 am, April 03, 2020 "
"Wall Street Journal reports that the government announced that all non essential businesses must shut down . Soft drink companies are essential but breweries are not. Modelo then announced they were shutting down the locations that produced Corona, etc.Edited: 12:46 pm, April 03, 2020 "
"It would be great if instead of people just posting ""the sky is falling"" breaking NEWS - that they supply a link to it backing up their crisis. Especially for those who are not ""on the ground"" here, per say. Thank you RonVal for posting links........Edited: 1:04 pm, April 03, 2020 "
"@Mikethe Cop, No. First of all ""the government"" like in any other democracy, stands for thousands of autonomous offices and individuals, in this case as I pointed before, it was the Health Secretary who issued this mandate, and I sent you a nice link for you to read, which is probably the source of the WSJ. Second, no one said soft drinks are essential (!) and at this point anything you post is suspect. I don't know where you get your info but I hope you don't say next that Kool-Aid is also essential."
"Mexico City (AFP) - Two Mexican brewers, including the producers of Corona beer, have said they are reducing production because of the health emergency in the country over the COVID-19 pandemic.Grupo Modelo -- whose brands include Pacifico and Modelo as well as Corona -- said the measure was in line with the Mexican government's order to suspend all non-essential activities until April 30 to slow the spread of coronavirus.""We are in the process of lowering production at our plants to the bare minimum,"" the company said in a statement on Thursday, adding it would complete the suspension in the following days.Dutch-Mexican brewer Heineken Cuauhtemoc Moctezuma -- which makes the Tecate and Dos Equis brands -- likewise said Friday it was ""executing a plan to reduce our operations... safeguarding care for the environment and with the sole objective of avoiding irreversible effects that could make it impossible to reactivate our economic activity.""- ADVERTISEMENT -Mexico's government has said that only key sectors such as agribusiness will be able to continue to function under current restrictions.Grupo Modelo said it was ready to operate with 75 percent of its staff working remotely to guarantee the supply of beer, if the government agreed.On Wednesday, the northern state of Nuevo Leon, where Heineken's Mexican operations are based, said it would stop the production and distribution of beer, which led to panic buying.""These times demand a collective effort to confront this situation,"" said Heineken.Since the start of the virus crisis, Corona beer has been the punchline of jokes and memes, and an online rumour said sales in the US dropped by around 40 percent after the outbreak.However, in late February, Constellation Brands, which owns the Corona label, denied the rumour and said sales had stayed strong in the US even as the virus has spread internationally.Mexico has so far registered over 1,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 50 deaths.From MexicoNewsDaily.comhttps:/…Edited: 1:29 pm, April 03, 2020 "

Signs first............stores next?https:/…1
"Not surprised, and hopefully the government will respond with help. These protestors are fine with the idea of staying at home - if there is some way they can provide for their families. That is the heart of the problem."
Here we go...............https:/…
