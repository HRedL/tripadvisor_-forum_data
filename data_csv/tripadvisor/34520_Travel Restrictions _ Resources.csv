"Hello Forum,We booked a trip this past January 2020 (pre Covid) for 31 October - 11 Nov. 2020. It appears re-opening of borders is unlikely. Nothing has been canceled by our airline or accommodation hosts. I think Jetstar is currently canceled until 25 October, we fly 31 October so our flight still shows it is scheduled. And our accommodation rental will allow us to cancel if the country is closed beyond our arrival date for Covid. Is there a good resource that provides a status of the border situation and timelines for opening up to USA visitors?I've been looking here. https:/…travel-restrictions-0But the basic answer appears to be Australia is closed to foreign visitors. Which is totally understandable, I'm just working through the cancellation process.  Thank You."
"I can say that you will not be coming to Australia on that date.They have even reduced the amount of Australian and PRs that can return.Things were looking good for Travel bubble with NZ. That will not probably happen this year.Good Luck , perhaps we might see you in 2021"
"This is part of the official government website advice on Covid 19:health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coron…We are in the midst of a second wave in my state, Victoria, but many other states are in a much better position. However, I think it is extremely unlikely that anyone from a country with major Covid cases, such as the US, will have any chance of coming into Australia this year. Hold off till the airline cancels the flight, so you can get a refund.Edited: 10:01 pm, July 21, 2020 "
"Being from the USA - there is a 0% chance of you coming here this year, and probably not much higher next year (unless they somehow come up with a safe vaccoine in that period)...Your president finally admitted today things will ""probably"" get worse before they get better..."
"Best to start now with your cancellations. Perhaps try again in 2022.Edited: 2:06 am, July 22, 2020 "
"I don’t think now is the time to start cancelling anything. Not because I think there is even the remotest chance you can enter Australia then. It’s just too soon. You need to wait to closer to the time and the service providers may then cancel which puts you in a better place.The exception would be if they are all offering full refunds now or have Waivers in place with terms you’re happy with for these dates. Do your research now but wait to At least mid September or even later.Companies know the borders won’t be open for US. Itizens then but by only doing cancellations a few weeks ahead it helps them manage the workload better than if they cancelled severL months at one time.I knew I wasn’t going on my May trip but the airline didn’t cancel until 2 weeks before the departure date.Edited: 3:25 am, July 22, 2020 "
"You accommodation won't cancel your reservation unless the government imposes another lockdown and they are forced to close. You should contact them closer to the time and explain your situation and hopefully they will refund your money if you prepaid. Most accommodation providers seem to have been doing this.Where are you flying from and to with Jetstar? This may be a problem. They have been cancelling flights depending on the rules of the state, but not cancelling all flights across the board. So you may not be able to fly from Victoria to Queensland for example and your flights would like be cancelled, but at the same time you may be able to fly from NSW to the NT and your flights won't be cancelled and you'd have to claim the cost against your travel insurance.In the event your flights are cancelled, you should receive an email from Jetstar, outlining your options. It may be quicker to just log in to their website and check rather than wait for the email. They will say you are entitled to credit and mention nothing about a refund. However, that's not the case. You can get a refund, you just need to use their online chat function and request it."
By cancelling now the accommodation provider can seek to find Australians who are actually able to stay there instead. By waiting to cancel at the last minute you are doing them a disservice.
"Most booking websites have provisions now that allow you to change,postpone or cancel (for credit) your bookings. As a general rule, if you cancel the bookings yourself, they will not refund you (unless it was part of the booking/cancellation policy) but will credit you. If you wait for them to cancel the booking, they have to give you a refund.I think you will need to cancel to the hotels yourself, as hotels remain open even during lockdown (people need places to stay), but wait for the airline to cancel the flights."
