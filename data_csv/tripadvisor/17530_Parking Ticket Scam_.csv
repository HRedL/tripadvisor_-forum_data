"Wondering if anyone has heard of this-My sons arrived in Jaco yesterday. They rented a car from Budget at San Jose Airport- cost about $350 including all insurance for a 5 day trip.They parked in a spot clearly labeled (or so they thought) okay to park- where other cars were but got a ticket and their plates were taken off the car. The ticket was for $95USD. They went to the Budget office and the man said they have to pay the ticket PLUS $400USD ""administrative fee"" AND it takes 15 days to get the plates back for the car and they cannot drive it without plates. They are flying home on Tuesday - they won't be there for 15 days! SO- they are out $845 and now stranded in Jaco with no car that they paid for.Is this a thing in Costa Rica??"
Well yes! It is a thing in CR that if you park illegally you will receive a ticket and they will remove both plates. The process and cost of reparation to the rental company is based upon the company and unfortunately your dealing with one of the worst. I can tell you at Adobe it is $100 and that's it.
"OK so just did a little research and found out it IS a thing- but NOT a scam! Apparently it is a ""plate recovery fee."" The police take the plates and the rental agency has to get them back so it is just as much a pain for them hence the ""administrative fee."" I feel better now!Be EXTRA CAREFUL where you park!!!"
Thank you pohljm for clearing that up! Our posts popped up at the same time haha!
The only thing is that they sent me a picture and they were in WHITE lines!Oh well- it is what it is- live & learn I guess!
"Not a scam. But the BIG problem is, it is hard to know where you are allowed to park and where not. Very often not really clear. Certainly NOT where the sidewalk is paved yellow or where is a sign with a crossed-out ""E"".Also not allowed to park ON the road......In more touristy places (i.e. Manuel Antonio) I always try and find some sort of guarded/official/paid parking."
So sorry...but hard to give you a good answer...roadadvsior
"To make you feel a bit better even, the rental car company might add the cost of 2unavailability of the car to to rent"" to the administration fee. Some 3rd party CDW insurances do cover such costs."
"Roadadvisor, there is a good answer IMHO. Bureaucratic overreach . . . to quote Frederick Douglas “Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have the exact measure of the injustice and wrong which will be imposed on them.” The removal of plates used to be reserved for real infractions and almost never implemented. To remove plates for parking, to remove tourist plates for parking in ill defined areas, to impose this kind of penalty for a parking incident is unacceptable and just plain wrong.These kind of changes cannot continue if we are to evolve as a developed tourism destination. Unacceptable. Wrong. Lets hope this incident will start a proper debate in places where someone will change this.Or does anyone think this is right?BerniPura Vida Hotel"
Oh my!! They did purchase every insurance available so hopefully they don't end up paying $2000 for the privilege of NOT driving a car for 5 days!Thanks for the heads up :)
"I agree! I love Costa Rica, have been there several times and my father lived there for 20 years. This is really a ridiculous way to treat tourists. There should be some kind of information posted to make clear what parking areas are okay and the rental agencies should explicitly WARN you about parking VERY carefully and explain the charges when you pick up the car- not put it in the microscopic fine print of the contract. Clearly the police know that a rental car is usually a foreigner who may be confused and in the absence of a blatant illegal parking, the benefit of the doubt should be given. My sons sent me the picture and they were in the white lines so I'm not sure what went wrong. Maybe the car stuck out 1 inch over? They are college kids in their 20's in Jaco to surf and had this headache. Very unfair- but as they say..... life is unfair!"
"@11, ""Clearly the police know that a rental car is usually a foreigner who may be confused ..."" Would be hard to imagine that they do not.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Hmm, not that sure only tourists are renting cars in costa Rica. there are so many expats there, many on constant ""visa run"" so they would need to rent a car while in the country. And then there are locals also. Regarding police officers, they are doing their job. They could look the other way ... but they should not. That is why the taxpayers are paying their salaries. OTOH the rental car companies could and should be more accommodating in such cases. Those who understand about how the proper customer oriented services works surely are.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Xelas, amigo, you need to be here more often. Overreach has spread the last few years to epidemic proportions. Tell me world traveler, how many countries remove plates for minor parking infractions?BerniPura Vida Hotel"
Could you post the photos of the area where they parked? That could help prevent this from happening to someone else.
Taking license plates is the same effect as towing the vehicle. Worse even because then the car is still illegally parked and no way to move it!Transit police are not well-liked in Costa Rica and things like this are a big part of it.
"Berni mon ami, I must have been lucky ... or very prudent when parking! But I will heed to your advice, about visiting Costa Rica more often. Do you know about a lodge that would need ad interim manager?"
"Yes Xelas, plenty of lodges would like a relief manager particularly one with your knowledge of the country - getting someone trained up on a lodges activities is hard though and takes time. It is easier if you cover an inactive lodge for example in October.So in your experience what countries are taking plates for minor parking infractions?BerniPura Vida Hotel"
"This is awful. In the future, don't use that rental car company. Vamos -- and a couple others -- are much more reliable."
I drive around MY dear country. almost daily .and only one time they removed my plates...well I did deserved it..It is interesting how some people can give opinions against the practice...is a nice free country.In my case I m in favor of the plate removal...not ALL foreigners that rent cars or even locals are nice people..some rent a cars are use by criminals natives or foreigners...for criminal activies !!Any way at least police is doing somenthing...if they do not do anything some will scream like a baby !! or is a bad idea !!..and if they do it is a big deal and terrible practice...is as somebody say...hard to please people 100% of the time...Thank you RACANDEE...totally with you...In my case is not worth it to know the numbers of countries where they remove plates...honestly and with all my respect I can care less !!

Number of problems I have had would also be zero and I do believe there is a correlation. Number of problems I have heard about from other gringos would be in the hundreds and Costa Rica is disproportionately represented without a doubt.Oh, and number of places I was not able to get to without renting a car would also be zero."

"In my experiences ... none. But back in time in Ljubljana they put clams on your tire, or just removed it with ""pajk"" (""spider""). No driving until the fine is paid in full, and extra costs at reaching that company's depot and paying them for ""taking care"" of the vehicle. Different countries different measures ... or laws.The other topic, I will send you an email."
"Since roadadvisor seems to have misread my post, I did not say that 'most of the time' I do not rent cars. I said I have never once rented one. I'd also be curious as to how he came up with 3 million visitors per year when CR's own embassy website says 1.7 million:www.costarica-embassy.org/index.php?q=node/19So roadadvisor seems to be off by about 76.5%. Even more fascinating would be how he or she determined that a 'great percentage' rent cars. But if he or she has spent over 60 years driving, given that the driving age in Costa Rica is 18, he or she is probably senile."
"Jackson, calm down. not everyone closing that age is senile :-)); I still have a decade to get there, and one day hopefully you will be there also, yes?!I can relate to your travel record, and travel type. Mine is on the opposite side of the travel rainbow; in past 25+ years I have always rented a car when visiting a foreign country. In the process of doing so I have seen enough of ""parking attendants"" and curious traffic regulations, yet I have had the good luck not to fall into one. And as you also myself I was able to visit each and every location on my itinerary.Is my way better then your way? For sure not. My way suits me (and many others) and your way suits you (and many more others). However, same as I am not ""qualified"" to discuss possible pitfalls and problems of using local transportation and private drivers, you are also not ""qualified"" to discuss issues related to renting and driving a car. Less so to judge other posters.Edited: 1 year ago "
"I never said I never drove. I said I never RENTED a car. I've driven a fair amount in LatAm, mostly motorcycles. This difference is, all the cops can tell what cars are rentals and this leads to the type of issues the OP faced."
"The cops will try to shake down tourist van drivers too, if they spot gringos in the seats. One of the transit police cops tried that when our driver was taking us back from the Pto Viejo area to the SJO area. He changed his behavior right quick when he noticed (with some help from our driver) that the driver was recording him with a dashboard camera. They try to target people unlikely to know their rights."
"Lets not get nasty now with comments about people's age. Let's just deal with the facts.First tourism data in Costa Rica is spotty and sometimes misleading and always contradicted by other data. Wiki for example claims "" to a historical record of 2.66 million foreign visitors in 2015"". ICT (the national tourism agency) has old data showing here https:/…tourism-figures.html showing 1.8 million tourists in 2017. Qcostarica claims the following ""During the first half of the year, 1.73 million visitors arrived in Costa Rica, a figure 3.9% higher than that reported in the same period in 2018"". How many ""foreign visitors"" are from Nicaragua and participate not one iota in tourist activities like car rentals?OK so pick a number.Next this was NOT a cop shakedown - there is no way the individual over zealous cop gained financially from taking the tourist plate. Let us not confuse the description directly from the OP with other events that may have happened before. If you can figure out how this was a shakedown post the details here?Next it was NOT a car rental scam. Yes it may have been a car rental agent extending their full extent of what they could charge given the circumstances described by the OP. Personally, understanding how a tourist might feel, in the same situation I would not have done what the agent did. I would have eaten it. Bad call IMHO. If you can figure out how it was a car rental scam post it here?We probably won't hear back directly from THAT car company about how they feel BUT I am pretty certain they right now really hate what happened and are looking for a better way to deal with this problem in the future. This kind of double jeopardy may be legal but it is an utterly inappropriate result of a minor parking infraction. How other respected regular posters here cannot see that I do not know.I am going to forward this thread directly to a couple of local car companies and see if they'd care to comment.BerniPura Vida Hotel"
"If there goal is to make sure they collect the fine (tourists otherwise could easily just skip the country without paying), the solution seems very obvious. Fine the rental company, who would keep a ""violations"" deposit from the customer until it's confirmed that there are no parking/speeding ticket violations.As a tourist, it seems very obvious that while this is going on, to avoid taking a rental vehicle into places like La Fortuna, Manuel Antonio, and other areas where the Transit Police are known to do this."
"The OP said something about a white painted curb and in my country that means motorcycles only, although I have no idea how the average visitor would figure that out. In a FEW places there are little motorcycles painted at the end of the white lines but again, why would the average visitor be looking for that? Costa Rica likes to screw tourists from the moment they arrive at the airport, by which I refer to the overpriced official airport taxis. Lots of places have those, of course, but they still suck."
Of course it is a money grab. As Rac said it solves nothing because the car is still there so why else would they do it?Maybe I missed something but I have only seen one poster who agreed with it.
Would a tow truck and ride back to the rental car location have helped anyting? Maybe replaced car under original contract after fine paid?
"It seems to me that if a car is parked illegally, and if one assumes that these parking regulations are related to safety and orderly transit, then it should be clear that taking the plates and leaving the car is an absurd approach. So yes, if it's parked where it is dangerous or impeding orderly transit, then towing is the correct solution.At that point it becomes almost ineluctable that since removing the plates solves no transit or safety issue, it can really have no other motivation besides lining someone's pockets. And it would surprise me very little to find out that the car rental companies kick back to the cops.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Wow- didn't mean to start such a heated debate lol! Update on my boys...They did pay the Budget ""fee"" for them to retrieve the plates (which IS clearly stated on the Budget Costa Rica website btw- we just never saw it because I rented the car through regular US Budget site) and they paid the ticket. Came to $436 USD. They also lost the $$ on the rental of the car. Now there is a charge for $1900 USD on my son's visa for ""lost use"" because the plates will take 2-3 weeks to get back. The insurance they paid (about $58 per day for the 5 days) does not cover ""lost use"", it only covers collision and liability. I have heard of lost use charges before in the case of an accident so it's not a scam really. What I don't understand is the car itself for 5 day rental was only $35.60- that's only $7.12/day USD. The insurance was what was $58/day- so how do they get $1900 for lost use? That would be nearly 266 days of lost use!! An expensive lesson for sure!! And yes- let the police do their job. Obviously it was a problem for CR for them to have to go to the extreme of taking plates BUT... all this of retrieving them back, lost use charges and all of it- not the rental car company's fault I agree but the police should change the procedure and just put a higher fine on the ticket- charge $300 or $500 but to have this craziness with retrieving the plates is simply, absolutely ridiculous- especially for tourists who cannot stand in line themselves because it takes weeks to even get an appointment."
"@38, thank you for posting the update. So, they are out of even more $$ than it first appeared. Sorry it happened to your family. Hopefully, they know what their alleged violation had consisted of."
"I recommend American Express's supplemental rental policy. It is $19.95 per rental for a rental of up to 42 days. It's primary coverage so you don't need to file with your own auto insurer and risk a premium increase. It has zero deductibles. You just pay for the rental with an AMEX card and the coverage automatically kicks in. Checking now to see if it covers loss of use … YES. So the total coverage is $75k. Covers damage, loss of use, towing and storage. Also theft or damage to personal belongings up to $2.5k (on top of the $75k) although that coverage is secondary to any other insurance you have (homeowners' or renters'). $7.5k personal injury (secondary) and $75k accidental death. It's a great deal. Covers more types of vehicles than most credit cards: 4 x 4s, SUVs, etc. Not valid in the following six countries: Australia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, and New Zealand. Check it out! I don't know if it would have helped in this situation since it was not an accident, but it's cheap and anyone who rents cars a lot should consider it strongly."
"Or just rent the car with a CC that provides CDW coverage like our Costco Citibank. Decline the coverage from the car rental company which has a $1000 deductible anyhow. Citibank just reimbursed us for the damage I inflicted on our rental as well as the license plate replacement fee for car #2 when some thoughtful thief stole the front plate, but replaced the screws?? No deductible, fully reimbursed. And use a reputable CR car rental company like Vamos or in our case Adobe. They could not have been better through this process which took about 3 weeks.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Thanks Travelfairy for kicking back in with more details. If Amex premium covers loss of use I would very much advise my guests to use it. We already advise Amex premium but I was unaware of this twist till you posted the loss of use charge which I think is way wrong anyway. See Jacksonbuenosaires comment.You say you have a photo and possibly a location of the minor parking infraction? Is it possible you can send it to me privately. I am continuing this debate with ""officials"" offline to see what can be done so that tourists do not get pulled into the quagmire you got into? I really suggest you raise this up the local rental car management hierarchy - this last charge is just off the scale IMHO.Thank you for sharing this!BerniPura Vida Hotel"
"Hello travelfairy,My name is Maria Jose and I represent the Costa Rica Car Rental Association (ACAR in Spanish) on the forum. I am sorry to see that your sons have found themselves facing unanticipated additional expenses due to the parking ticket they received and your comprehension of the rental car company's situation in dealing with the parking fine and confiscated license plates. Changes to the law regarding parking were made in July 2017 which was when the traffic police first were given the power to remove license plates from vehicles illegally parked. https:/…Although this article is in Spanish, the illustration accompanying the article clearly outlines the numerous steps required to reclaim the license plates and pay the fine. ACAR has attempted methods to appeal this regulation as it appears to be a double punishment for a singe offence -- the fine and the confiscation of the plates. Unfortunately, these legal efforts with governmental authorities have so far been rejected. The average time period to recuperate the plates is 5-20 days, depending on various situations, and as you can imagine; this represents a high cost to the car rental agency.At ACAR, we are very conscious of the problems that the parking tickets cause our clients and are urging our members to charge costs that have the least impact on customers."
"The governmemt’s policy is frankly insane—effectively impounding a vehicle for weeks over a parking ticket is not defensible.We were on the fence about whether to keep or cancel our car rental reservation, but since we will be in Manuel Antonio part of the time we will definitely cancel.Unfortunate that the car rental agencies as well as tourists have to suffer because of the stupid law, but there is no way around it."
"I totally understand the problem from the rental car agency's side but I just think that they should WARN tourists and explain the parking situation CLEARLY when the car is being picked up as well as telling them that the insurance they buy at 8x the daily rental price of the car ( $7/day rental fee, $58/day insurance) does not cover ""lost use."" Now that my boys are home, I see why they were in the wrong. They parked along a yellow curb but within WHITE lines at the front and back of the car to mark the parking spot. There were cars in front and behind them all along the street and a clearly marked ""spot"" with 2 white lines showing where the car had to be in between (kind of like in the States at parallel metered street parking.) They assumed (wrongly) that it was ok to park there. Again, I just think the law should be changed to increase the ticket cost and not remove the plates so everyone does not end up in a giant mess. I have also since read stories of fake ""parking lot attendants"" who charge to park in a ""lot"" and unbeknownst to the tourist, the plates get taken for illegal parking. There should just be better parking warnings at rental agencies and even at the airport."
"@45, thank you for the update.Have you seen the last sentence in Post # 37? If that is incorrect, why, if this has been going on for yrs, aren't they warning ppl at the rental agencies? Your guess is as good as anyone's..."
"Thanks Travelfairy for doing some follow up on this.The end result of this police action was to cause you a major expense that was unanticipated and not covered by the insurance you thought covered you for any eventuality. I have been involved in tourism here for many years and believe taking plates for a minor parking infraction is overkill and not expected by tourists who are not used to losing plates for anything let alone parking.Thanks for bringing this to our attention. On the one hand I will alert my future guests but on the other hand I believe this is a really dumb thing to happen to tourism. It is EXTRA dumb because the agency that takes the plates cannot get them back in any reasonable time and you became penalized twice for THAT. You got an ""administrative fee"" for losing the plates AND a ""loss of use fee"" that was not directly associated with the loss of rental.You say you ""understand the rental agencies"" side, frankly I do not. This is a compounded problem caused by the police and the rental agency. Maria Jose from ACAR and Budget is likely listening and hopefully they will find a way to make sure you are not punished twice for costs you really did not cause viz:1) the long time it takes to get the plates back from COSEVI - the rental agencies should take it in their hands to fix this2) the insurance costs on days you were not using the car or did not even have the car in your possessionThat is the short term IMHO. In the long term we need to stop taking plates for minor traffic infractions.BerniPura Vida HotelFYI, I just looked up reasons police can take plates in some states in the US and they are serious infractions such as drunk driving or driving when your license is suspended or driving with no insurance."
Can be hard to advice every person renting cars...where or where not to park...I talked to a police officer...and he toll me...that some people ( not your case ) they move the car to a whitel zone and then take the picture...in a white zone...possible ??Is like a guy that hit my car when I was at a red light..he hit me from behind...now he claims I was driving in reverse...of course still waiting for Traffic judge to tell us whos fault it was...Nice if you have advice from people that rent cars while in Costa Rica...So sorry I really hope you will get a happy end!!roadadvisor
"Dear Maria Jose, if ACAR and rental car companies are very conscious of the problems that the parking tickets cause your clients, why not helping them? I understand that there is a long and usually a futile way to fight the governmental bureaucracy, yet you can adapt your own rules easily. There are costs that are fix costs, and those must be allocated to the client. But then there are other costs that could be avoided i.e. not charged to the client. Like the cost of unavailability of the rental car. How often the bigger companies (like those you are representing) have zero vehicles on the parking lot?! So instead of fighting with the government fight with th rental car companies, for the benefit of their clients."
"Thank you for your feedback on this challenging issue. Every governmental institution has the legal right to five working days days in which to carry out processes. This translates to five days for the Transit Office, five days to transfer the license plates and five days for COSEVI (The Road Safety Council) to return the license plates. This equates to three full weeks for the transaction from confiscation to return. In January 2019, the Costa Rican Car Rental Association (ACAR) contracted a firm of lawyers which recommended raising the matter with Sala IV (our country's Supreme Court of Justice which ensures the effective compliance with the norms and the protection of the rights and fundamental rights of the constitution.) because the new parking regulations were effectively punishing the car owner and renter twice: with a fine and the confiscation of the license plates. In the meantime, our members are trying to unify a single payment to reclaim the license plates. The amount needs to be much less than the loss of earnings; however, we have not yet reached agreement and every company has its own policies. ACAR can only make recommendations. This thread has raised the issues that the parking regulations provoke and our members are newly concerned. We will be returning to this theme in our next meeting and look forward to updating on this forum soon."
Forget about the 5 days...Trafic tickets most of the time hard to immpossible to dispute...I know that by fact...really is a wastet of time...Acar do not have any legal power to help anybody...and if they do...!! why 100% of the time they do not do anything ??RoadadvsiorTravel ProfeSionalEdited: 1 year ago 
"@47, If it is such a difficult and pricey thing for rental companies to obtain the plates back, why wouldn't they post the current parking rules on their own rental sites and provide that info with every car they rent out? They provide lots of other fine print...it has been going on for awhile, and from I understand, it is just the timing that now also allows the police to remove the plates in the absence of the driver that has changed."
"Indeed. I bright yellow sticker on the windshield that will remind the driver about possible problems if she/he would park the car wrongly. And, with description of ""yellow curb line"". The ACAR could also invest into printing those same informations on a piece of paper to be given to each client. Fighting the government is a tedious process; helping a client with proper informations is just a matter of willingness (and some money)."
"ACAR you cannot be serious that you agree with the following statement "" Every governmental institution has the legal right to five working days days in which to carry out processes. This translates to five days for the Transit Office, five days to transfer the license plates and five days for COSEVI (The Road Safety Council) to return the license plates. This equates to three full weeks for the transaction"".The intent of this rule was not that tourists wait for 3 weeks for the government to get something done?It was that government processes do not take MORE THAN 5 days. The fact that 3 (count them 3) government agencies get involved puts the tourist in a catch 22 and makes the net effect 15 days.Even 5 days is an unacceptable impact on the average 10 day vacation tourists are able to afford. How can we justify 3 agencies all get 5 days? Why is this all of a sudden acceptable to the car rental agencies? Or to anyone engaged in tourism?While someone fixes this I like Xelas idea of a window sticker to avoid ruining more vacations with bureaucracy - could we propose all car rental agencies that are ACAR members do that? More fine print on the rental contract will be ignored.But while we are at it ACAR, do you agree the original poster should not have been charged for insurance they did not use at minimum?BerniPura Vida Hotel"
"Why not just have the government fine the car rental agency directly and let the agencies keep a deposit from customers in case there is such a violation? Less paperwork and guaranteed payment for the government (plus no reputational damage,, and a vacation that is not completely ruined and no vehicle loss for the customer and agency respectively. The way the government is doing it right now is just plain terrible. Three different government agencies involved? Ridiculous."
"This all seems so sad. Some or most ppl work hard for their brief vacation times, as well as invest time and effort into planning it, and to have it ruined like that plus end up paying all the extra $$, is just ridiculous."
"For years I have been telling people not to rent cars in Costa Rica. Now, one poster said to just use a credit card that covers CDW but you will find that to be secondary coverage, whereas AMEX is primary coverage. Still doesn't address the ticos confiscating cars for weeks on end for minor infractions. Solution? Do not rent a car in Costa Rica. Alternate solution would be to not even GO to Costa Rica and if the government keeps towing cars, intelligent travelers will seek that alternate solution and go to Guatemala. If you rent a car in Guatemala and you have a problem you just bribe the cop 500 quetzales and the problem goes away."
"ANOTHER UPDATE:The $1900 on my son's credit card dropped off so we thought maybe the $440.80 (Budget fee + ticket cost) was going to cover it. Today we got charged $801.90 from Budget. They retrieved the plates on 8/22/19. (They were taken on 8/10/19) I called the Budget location in CR and they said ""as per contract"" they charged me the entire amount for the 12 days of lost plates (as if I had been renting the car and using it the whole time) INCLUDING THE INSURANCE of $53.97 PER DAY! Okay so before I wasn't necessarily blaming Budget as they DID lose the ""use"" of the car (even though as previous poster said- it may not have been the last car on their lot but whatever) but to charge me daily insurance rate of $53.97 is CORRUPTION AND HIGHWAY ROBBERY. I think my boys are gonna be surfing in another country from now on!!!!"
That is absolutely terrible. Budget is the worst. Keep hammering on them. There should be no reason to charge you insurance while the car is not being used.
"@58, agree with Post 59. Try to achieve a better outcome. It is not even funny to pretend that it is ok or ""as per contract"". (What part in the contract said that, BTW?)"
"Thanks again for your update on this unfortunate situation. And I can feel your pain! Not the overcomplicated law that they are using in Costa Rica, but the total lack of any decent customer service by Budget is what is simply incredible! And it shows also how this, and other similar companies, are heavily involved in not renting the cars but selling the expensive insurances. Now Maria Jose from ACAR might pull her strings and shake the Budget's management again, to drop those unfair charges for insurances for the period when the vehicle was not under the contract. For the period under the contract, I think the client is obliged to pay the whole amount irrelevant if the car was in use or not."
"Yes- they paid the original $363.44 for the 5 day rental when they picked the car up and lost the use of it. That's understandable. But this business of ""keeping the original contract open (daily rental fee + insurance) until the plates are returned"" for an additional 12 days is really just insane. AND on top of it they already paid the $440.80 for the Budget fee (website says $300) plus the ticket cost. The ticket portion did not go to Budget obviously but the $300 fee should cover the rest of rental. Other than MAYBE losing the $7/day for the lost ability to rent the car (and that would only be if it was the only car left to rent) Budget did not lose any $ on the ""lost insurance that they couldn't sell on the car. They have no way to prove that some poor tourist would get suckered into renting the car and purchasing all that insurance (like my boys haha) that doesn't even cover you if something like this (which appears common!!) happens! TOTALLY UNETHICAL. My boys surf in CR about 4x a year. They usually have a group of about 8 college boys. Many of our friends go to CR regularly. This is terrible to put a stain of corruption on a beautiful country with lovely people. The more I research on this problem, the more I find stories from tourists in the same situation. Why can't people just be honest instead of taking advantage of tourists like that. SOOOOO WRONG!!!"
"The insurance would also have been covering the car if, while it was sitting unused, it had been hit and run, right? So even though the per day amount seems excessive, I can see the point of charging for the collision insurance if it was sitting on the street somewhere. Did that insurance cover if say the windshield got smashed? That could happen even if it was impounded."
"Jackson, each rental car is fully insured by the company year long. Then the company try to sell those costs to future clients (at inflated rates). So, the car on the street was already insured. What company has lost is the ability to sell insurance costs to potential customers who would use that car if it would have found a new client.In the cutthroat capitalism way, they were right. But from the customer service perspective, they were wrong."
"@63, not quite the same insurance is required for the car that is definitely not being used on the Rds, I.e. stored without the plates, vs the car being driven. Insurance is based on the assessment of risks. And the daily premiums charged should have reflected the difference of what was happening with the vehicle when the OP's family was still being charged full price for driving it. The way it is done here is that a vehicle stored at some lot where it was towed, of just kept on someone's property when the owners are not using it, needs what they call here a theft/vandalism/fire protection, nothing else."
"So if the collision insurance could be separated from the theft/vandalism/fire, then I agree only the latter should be charged."
"Does not help you now, but in the future use either Adobe or Vamos and this would not happen. They really should not be entitled to the additional insurance, as their insurance would cover anything during its period of non use. Have you filed a dispute with the credit card company? They should be brought into the equation"
"63- The car was taken to the Budget store in Jaco and it was on their lot waiting for the plates to be retrieved. It was not left on the street. When I called Budget in CR, the manager put in my request for the breakdown of the charges. I received 2 emails reflecting the request and he said it would take a few days to send it to me. I will definitely dispute it with the credit card but I am waiting for the breakdown of the charges first. According to the manager, they have the right to ""continue the contract of the car as is until the contract closed out""- which in this case would have been when they received the plates back. I don't have high expectations that the credit card dispute will end in my favor. So...my boys end up paying $363.44(original rental) + $440.80 (Budget retrieve plates fee + ticket) + $801.90 (Budget corrupt, unethical, highway robbery fee) totaling $1606.14 for a car they didn't use. Lessons learned: 1) Never rent a car in CR 2) Find another country to surf in! 3) Tell as many people as you can to listen to #1 and #2!!"
BTW- Maria Jose- Is charging my boys for the 12 days of insurance after the original 5 day rental period allowed? Is it really in Budget's contractual right to do so? Are all car rental companies like this? I have the contract but the print is SOO small and SOO long that I would need a microscope and a week just to read what it says.
"@69, possibly read it on line using a larger font. (I sympathize with this whole situation, but the drivers/renters should have read it already.)"
"Xelas #64, for a rare moment I must disagree with your definition of what is capitalism. A good or service has a price that is set. A customer makes a decision based on the price presented. Just because the car rental company price is not an actual price has no effect on the decision the customer makes to buy something based on that price. The customer bought something for a set price that was not delivered - they did not USE (in fact could not USE) the insurance they bought and during that time the car itself was not at risk from the hair raising possibilities of a foreign driver on our roads at night in Jaco. Therefore also the risk that is covered by said insurance did not exist either. How the machinations of pricing work INSIDE the car rental company does not matter to the person who buys the unused (nay unusable) product in question that they were billed for after the fact?No? or Oui?BerniPura Vida HotelEdited: 1 year ago "
"Travelfairy, I just looked at our receipt for the charges for loss of use for the last claim that we paid to Adobe for crashing their car. 5 days of down time came out to $72 dollars US TOTAL. So the lessons learned really should be 1. Do your due diligence on Car Rentals in a foreign country. 2. Do not park illegally. Tell as many people to read #1 and #2. You should keep moving forward for restitution with your CC company. Its clearly not acceptable to be charged for the insurance."
"The whole ""loss of use"" issue is a big deal in a lot of countries. The rental car industry is an interesting one. You want to use your capital assets exhaustively, so you want them in use as much as possible. Now, suppose Tourist X negotiates a bad deal with Rental Company Y. Tourist X is young and possibly naïve and did not put much thought into insurance and which credit card to use and so forth. So let's say X and Y agree on, at the time of signing after the rental agent sells them a lot of crap insurance and maybe lies to them in the process, or scares them, or whatever, of $80 a day, broken down as follows:$40 car$20 collision insurance$10 fire, theft and vandalism$10 personal goods insuranceLet's then assume that the CR police allege a parking violation, which the rental company has no way of knowing is untrue (later we could sure discuss the possibility they absolutely knew and colluded). Then let's assume some time intervals.First of all, during the original rental period, the rental company has taken that car off the market for the entire period that X rented it, right? And budgeted and planned to receive $80 for all those days. I do indeed believe Y should get all the money in the original contract, subject to a ""duty to mitigate,"" meaning if they get the car back in time to rent it, they should, and give that money to X. Property leases are written like that. If I move out of the lease early, you have to try to rent it out again. You can't just laugh at me and keep all my money.Now, after the original contract period, assume the vehicle is available to no one. From that point forward, is ""loss of use"" what naive X agreed to pay or should it be more of an average rental rate vs. a more optimal rate? I say it should be a past average rental rate and a past average of any sucker charges. An interesting point that was brought up was the idea of there is only lack of use if there are no more cars on the lot and that's not really true because inventory is heavily shared and profit depends on accurate inventory and demand forecasts. To summarize, don't rent a car in Costa Rica or more generally don't just knee-jerk rent cars because you normally have a car at home. A leading source of vacation problems and I have been crying into the wilderness at gringos about this, in particular concerning Costa Rica, for twenty years."
"And re #71: insurance is a product that has value whether used or not, and in fact is one of the few examples of a product one purchases and hopes not to use. And the rental car company can't re-sell the product while the car is unavailable. The rental car company has no choice but to assume the police were impounding the car legitimately, and thus the renters were in the wrong.Sounds like the law or government policy is the root of this evil and not the rental company. The rental company just sold some crappy insurance someone agreed to buy and anything after that is out of their control."
"Please allow me to further update on this thread with a response from Budget's management:Budget has now closed the contract which has been under discussion here as the license plates have been returned. The reservation was prepaid, but additional charges were due to the parking ticket, for renters under the age of 25, fuel charges as the car had been rented with a full tank of gas and was returned with less, use of a debit rather than credit card, the administrative costs as well as other charges outlined in our webpage https://www.budget.co.cr/faq/ . These costs were provided transparently to the client and the contract was signed by the renters.Unfortunately, Budget has had to deal with five such cases since the introduction of the Transit Law No 9078 with the related inconvenience and costs to both the company and the customer.  https:/…EstacionamientoalThe law is fully explained in Spanish in the link above and the final lines states: “El incumplimiento de las disposiciones anteriores faculta a la autoridad de tránsito para que retire el vehículo cuando no esté el conductor, u obligar a este a retirarlo, sin perjuicio de la multa respectiva.”""The failure to comply with the previous provisions empowers the transit authorities to remove the vehicle when the driver is no present or to oblige them to move the vehicle without affecting the respective fine.""Therefore, the plates are removed when the driver is not present if the transit official has verified that the Article 100 has been violated. We have seen the increased comments on TripAdvisor since the introduction of this law and although it is the responsibility of the renter to respect the laws of Costa Rica; we will refund the amount of the extra days and will refund the 50% of the administrative fee in a gesture of goodwill to our customers. But we hope that after reading this post, visitors to Costa Rica will respect the law and avoid similar situations. Thank you."
The OP and the rest of us will be very happy with the gesture of good will by the rental car company. Hopefully the OP will be kind to let us know about it.As drivers we are all aware of basic traffic rules but unaware of such things like removal of plates instead of a simple parking fine ticket. Thus do follow the advice given here about a sticker or a paper with informations to clients about this Costa Rica's specific traffic rule. Thanks for following up this forum trying to make your beautiful country even more visitor-friendly one.
"My son is 27 and he used a Capital One Visa card, not a debit card. It is difficult to follow the law when it is not clear- NOT AN EXCUSE by any means- just the facts in my boy's case. I already stated that they were IN THE WRONG, and it was NOT Budget's fault UNTIL they charged me for the insurance throughout the entire period.(whether it is in the contract or not) The administrative fee was understandable, as Budget does have to be inconvenienced themselves to retrieve the plates. I have said all along that though unfortunate, my boys were the ones to blame. However, charging an additional $801.90 for ""lost ability to charge $53.97/day for 12 days of insurance while the plates were not available and the car was sitting in Budget lot is what I thought was very wrong. And YES, they should have absolutely read the contract- but they are not attorneys and they didn't have a microscope or 1 week in the store to sit and read it! I had advised them to purchase all insurance available, even if it was expensive, so as to not have a problem in the case of any damage to the car.You would think with the rental rate of $7.12/day and insurance rate of $53.97/day, everything would have been covered. So far, I do not see the refund of any charges on the card but if what you say above is the case, we certainly deeply appreciate the gesture of goodwill. It will go a long way to repair a sour perception of a country we love so much."
"Hello ACAR & Budget & other car rental companies who may become aware of this important discussion,I am sure the original poster appreciates the goodwill effort. We also appreciate the efforts of the original poster to provide details of the problem so we can all understand it. THANK YOU!But this does not fix the problem for future tourists to Costa Rica MANY of whom rent cars and do not know they may loose their plates for a small parking infraction. This does not happen where they live, they do not expect it. According to ACAR Budget has 5 other cases and other car companies have the same problem. I know for a fact they do not like it any more than the OP appreciates what happened.2 things need to be done as soon as possible.1). Change the law (this may take a while but speed cameras were killed off in less than 6 months so it is possible). I am hoping that people involved in tourism in Costa Rica will lobby for a change of this draconian law.2). Issue tourists who rent cars with a card or sticker reminding them of the problem as suggested by Xelas.I will be doing that with my guests immediately - the card or sticker will say this:COSTA RICA PARKING ENFORCEMENT NOTICE:Be aware that Costa Rican traffic police are allowed to REMOVE YOUR CAR PLATES for minor parking violations such as parking on a yellow line at the curb. If that happens you may be charged for the plate removal and loss of use while the car is effectively impounded. This is not covered by your insurance and may result in up to 3 weeks of car rental charges. We hope the law will be changed soon but in the meantime be careful on our roads and be careful where you park.If anyone can chip in with any better ideas please chip in?BerniPura Vida Hotel"
"I agree completely with alajuelanorth but in addition, apparently tourists are supposed to know where the yellow paint used to be after it chipped and faded away because the curb hasen't been repainted in a decade or more. Don't get me going on the stolen (and sold for scrap metal) man hole covers and stop signs. End of rant...Edited: 1 year ago "
"@78,Thd OP posted, having seen the photo of the son's parking, that ""The only thing is that they sent me a picture and they were in WHITE lines!"""
"Awarness is the king, Berni! As for your Oui or Non question ... I prefer to have a longish debate on a lawn chair under the fading sun somewhere north of Alajuela :-))"
"UPDATE- Hello TA family- I am out of the country but my son just called me to let me know that Budget DID indeed refund the charges. Wow- I’m shocked as well as deeply grateful. That is an immense gesture of goodwill and yes- although it does not solve the problem, it certainly makes me feel better that the problem is not compounded by outrageous fees. Budget certainly did not have to refund as they were within their contractual right not to do so so THANK YOU BUDGET. They did the right thing. I have always used Budget almost exclusively when I travel so now I am happy to continue to do so. And YES- to all rental car companies in CR- please put a giant sticker warning tourists of this problem. At least they will be extra careful when parking. Thank you again Budget and TA family for all the info."
"Re Post 82: travelfairy6,Thank you for the update.As you said prior, ""...it was NOT Budget's fault UNTIL they charged me for the insurance throughout the entire period."", so it important to let ppl know that not only might they lose the use of the rental car after the police removes the plates, they will need to continue paying the full daily insurance while the vehicle is being impounded and not driven anywhere."

"I want to thank travelfairy6, the OP, for helping explain what happened here. I have been sharing this post with friends at Alamo and a local official involved with tourism in Alajuela. Alamo agrees with all of us that tourists should not be charged for services they have no control over and they answered the following question for their guests in the future (of course I do not and cannot represent them but I asked for clarification and this is what they said).""Will you charge for loss of use if plates are removed from a rental car by the police?"". . . Alamo will not charge for loss of use if plates are removed due to parking issue (yellow line or similar)""Do you charge anything for recovery of the plates?"". . . We will charge the Administrative Fee that is to recover the plates ($100) . . . In case the customer has not paid the fine in the bank, we will charge the fine as wellSo other than changing the law for minor parking infractions (which I believe should still be done) the subject is being worked on by some people (though this case in question was not an Alamo guest). Tourists also need to receive a small note to the effect that ""your car plates may be removed for minor parking violations"" when they rent a car.Thanks OP!BerniPura Vida Hotel"
"Thank you Berni...yes some people ll jump in top of any rent a car...and they do not even rent cars...from Budget, Alamo or anybody else ...that is funny and sad...how some people love to confuse nice people!!As we say here in Costa Rica ...some people have to learn if they do not have anything good to say PLEASE do not say anything !!Thank you Berni you are incredible...!!RoadadvisorTravel ProfeSionalEdited: 9:29 pm, September 06, 2019 "
"We were just ticketed in Dominican for parking downtown along the road with many other cars. Curiously only rental cars were ticketed. Fee was $110, but we could not get our plates back, so Vamos is towing a car to us. $650 later, and a lost day of vacation. Will never come back, Is this corrupt police practice, and or, are the rental agencies involved? We are going to report this to the US embassy . Curiously, the rental agency keeps a car for this situation. Complain if you must about America but instead appreciate our law and order."
"""Curiously only rental cars were ticketed."" I keep saying that rental cars are targeted and people keep telling me I'm full of it. Don't rent cars in Cost Rica."
"OnAir800654, Sorry that it happened to you and that there were many cars parked there, but only rental cars, as you were say, were ticketed. If you read this entire thread, you will see some possible answers, or thoughts, on this subject."
"Hello OnAir800654,Thank you for alerting potential rental car drivers of the consequences of parking illegally in Costa Rica. Regrettably, new traffic laws have resulted in the double punishment of a fine and license plate confiscation and we are just as frustrated by this situation as you are. We side with Berni with needing a helpful reminder for customers of this unexpected consequence. There is a section devoted to outlining this unfortunate issue on our FAQ page.Moreover, we do not hold vehicles for the explicit use for clients who have been penalized due to parking violations and it was challenging to find a replacement vehicle at such short notice during high season. Our company has charged the amount for the fine ($110), administrative costs ($150) and for the tow truck ($392.10) which totals $652.10. A tow is required because a car cannot be legally driven without license plates — which would result in more fines by COSEVI.Although no one wishes to have this additional amount on their vacation budget, we have not charged for the days when the vehicle cannot be used. We are losing money in this process so I think you’ll agree that we would not be involved in any type of scam with the transit police to issue such tickets. The time-consuming process of reclaiming the license plates and the staff hours needed to stand in lines are all part of the car rental company’s responsibility. We would greatly appreciate your complaint to the U.S. Embassy as it is inconvenient to all parties involved."
"Alex does not seem to mention it but he appears to work for Vamos. I am frankly astounded and happy to hear Vamos response which is beyond expectations. This is something this forum has come to expect from Vamos.It now appears a few (more?) car rental companies including Vamos, Alamo, Budget are chipping in to help tourists caught up in this asinine process that just does not happen in other countries. The law needs to change.To ONAIR60054 (recent poster) I know for a fact that your comments ""are the rental agencies involved? "" is absolutely not true. I have been on the other end of one of these events and the car rental agency was totally upset and flummoxed by the process as of course was the tourist.Let's understand that this situation is absurd and MUST be changed. I am copying my contacts in tourism to hope that the word gets out that this is not acceptable. The law must be modified.In the meantime we have had no problems - we now include this statement in an email to all guests who rent cars:""COSTA RICA PARKING ENFORCEMENT NOTICE: Be aware that Costa Rican traffic police are allowed to REMOVE YOUR CAR PLATES for minor parking violations such as parking on a yellow line at the curb. If that happens you MAY be charged for the plate removal and loss of use while the car is effectively impounded. This is not covered by your insurance and may result in up to 3 weeks of car rental charges. We hope this recent law will be changed but in the meantime be careful on our roads and be careful where you park. ALSO remember speeding and overtaking on double yellow has a steep fine here.""This is not an answer, merely a band aid. Let's find a way to fix it.BerniPura Vida Hotel"
Just rented a car in SJO. No advise from Avis on this. We parked on a street with NO yellow or white line with lots of other cars parked. When we walked off a local told my husband we shouldnt leave our car there as the police will take the plates. We came to the conclusion we cant park the car anywhere except a parking lot or in front of a store.
"Therefore, do not rent cars in Costa Rica."
"Thank you for your very helpful contributions on the ongoing issue of parking tickets and license plate confiscation, Berni. Please allow me to outline points from ACAR's President, Federico Barquero:With the changes in the Transit Law, traffic police officers from the Ministry of Public Transport or the relevant municipality can remove license plates when a vehicle is “badly parked.” The concept of “badly parked” does not only refer to parking on yellow lines. The traffic police officers can remove the plates when the vehicle is blocking the transit of other vehicles. When plates are removed from a vehicle, the return takes between 15 days and a month. There is not a defined policy for leasing or rental companies for the charges related to such an incident. ACAR encourages its members not to charge for the costs of recuperating the plates.Legal efforts were initiated to eliminate this issue as it is a double punishment of both the fine and the license plate confiscation, but these have so far been rejected.We have detected the majority of cases are generated by a few municipalities: Quepos, Dominical y Garabito and that these tickets are mainly issues by municipality transit officials.The President of ACAR, Federico Barquero, met with the Executive Director of COSEVI on February 26th and although he will ensure that the license plates are returned as quickly as possible; he has recommended meeting with the municipalities involved to try to address this issue. These meetings are yet to be arranged but we are continuing our efforts to resolve this issue and help our renters enjoy their vacations without such a situation occurring. The ICT (the Costa Rican Tourism Institute) is very supportive in efforts to resolve this situaiton too."
