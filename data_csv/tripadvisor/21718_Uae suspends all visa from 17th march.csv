A little more detail >>https://gulfnews.com/uae/government/uae-susp…
"Just to be clear, does this mean all visas ie, even those granted on arrival ie, a UK passport will be denied?"
"We can't be clear on what's not been said yet.I'd suggest hanging fire a couple of hours and see how the main sources - FCO, The National etc. - have to say. I'm sure more details will follow."
jesus moses what next.
"Thanks for the heads up, I'll keep an eye on FCO info. I'm due to fly next week on Sunday and had been uncertain about what to do, but if the decision is beyond my control then that would be a relief to be honest"
Not flying out until 6th April and tried calling Emirates helpline but couldn't get through.This doesn't come into effect until 17th March and I think you can get an eVisa online before going can't you?https:/…
"@HappyWoman14 - I agree, I’m currently unsure on how to go about the whole “Should I go/not” situation but if the FCO makes the decision it would be a great relief - although sad as I was really looking forward to going for my birthday :( .. However we’re not scheduled to go until the 31st March so will have to keep a close eye on things @Shaun C .. I have been reading quite a lot of your posts and just want to thank you for the updates and knowledge provided :)"
Thanks for sharing. Also keen to get more detail. We are due to arrive on 16th March so I don’t know how this affects us. Hopefully we will get more clarity soon.
"This will be interesting to see, my flight is due on the 5th of April and I would've been getting a visitor visa on entry too."
I just rang my travel agent I would have been flying through emirates they informed me as of now visas are suspended meaning we won’t be able to enter but to confirm on Monday
Does this affect uk visitors ?
no. every person worldwide but not uk visitors ;) yes of coruse. everyone is everyone.
I didn’t think UK visitors needed a visa but thanks
"UK passport holders are issued visas upon arrival, rather than applying for a visa in advance and being “accepted”. But this is all still very vague and probably best to wait for the FCO update/further information."
Thank you - we’re due to travel 2nd April Via Emirates... but it’s looking unlikely now
"Agree, understandably everyone is worried but let’s not be hasty."
Following.... We're due to fly out from Manchester on Wednesday evening. Any updates would be appreciated.
Have spoken to Emirates holidays. The call centre said they were waiting for proper confirmation from the ‘Higher ups’ but if was confirmed then they would get in touch with individuals about their bookings and would offer amendments or if not able to change refunds. Hopefully this will happen within next few days.
Can we apply for visas online from the UK or are they issued on arrival?
"I have spoken to emirates holidays also , as due to fly on Monday , they have said at the moment they have not received confirmation the Visa suspension would effect the UK. So will wait to see what else is released about it."
Yes I’m due to fly out soon I can feel for you all it’s devastating suitcases all packed and ready to go now this let’s wait and see although I’m not that hopeful
Yes same for me .
"Please people.This is no longer just Foreign Office advice on whether or not to travel to a place it is whether or not that place will allow you in if you do manage to get there.The UAE has suspended visas from 17th March - this means that it will close it's borders to all but UAE Nationals trying to get home.Even if you could apply for a visa online to try and get around the ban then it will be a worthless piece of paper as your citizenship will mean you do not get entry to the UAE.As soon as the UK government stood up and said ""we can't contain this any more but we are trying to delay it"" then it was only a matter of time before countries banned UK citizens from flying into their countries.Whilst the foreign office advice may remain that you can travel to the UAE, you won't be able to get there nor will the country allow you to go in.This means that you will hear from your airline/hotel/booking agent to cancel and offer you a refund or the opportunity to re-book. No point wasting energy and phone time trying to contact them.Please appreciate that trying to find out if Dubai is safe is an irrelevance at this point - UK citizens are deemed to be unsafe to accept, far more unsafe than UAE citizens.To put it in simple terms this weekend I was planning to come to your house in your town to stay for a few days from the town where I live. My town has declared that is has a virus that can't be controlled and that no one has any idea who has the virus and they've got so many cases they've stopped testing ..... can I still come to your house ?If you get your flight to Dubai with Emirates airline how will you get back ?Jet 2 flew people out to Cyprus right up until Friday - today they are ringing them all to tell them the time of rescue flights that are being sent out empty to bring UK nationals home. This is not because CYprus is deemd to be unsafe it is because UK Nationals are deemed to be unsafe. Cyprus currently has 7 cases of the virus.Hopefully it will pass and we will all get to the end of this year with the worst thing that has happened to us and ours being a cancelled holiday; if that happens then we will have had a good year.I think the time has come for me to stop commenting on this and similar topics and for UK folk to accept that they aren't going to be flying anywhere anytime soonStay safe everyoneLatimerEdited: 12:39 pm, March 14, 2020 "
Thanks for the info. Never been to Dubai so wasn't sure if we could apply online but like u say no point as not a citizen. Hopefully will be able to reschedule for later in the year.
"FWIW, if you already have a visa before 17th of March then you can still get in (as the government mentions that existing Visas are still valid, only after the 17th they are no longer issuing them). In my example my Wife is not a UK national and she had to apply for a sponsor visa via a hotel (which we had done a few weeks ago) so she's technically allowed to get in, but unfortunately I won't be able to as I was relying on the entry-stamp visa."
"Gutted. Thank you to those who post on this forum often, you’ve been a great source of information, much appreciated.Was so looking forward to our holiday but I totally understand the UAEs reaction. It’s going to be a nightmare in the UK, our government is resigned to letting most of the population get infected to provide herd immunity, really not sure that’s the way to go but hey, let’s have faith in our wise leader!!!!Stay safe everyone, wherever you are."
Me and my husband are due to fly out on Wednesday 18th from Manchester and we’re pretty confused whether the visa situation will be affecting us
"Hi all - we were due to fly with BA on monday and the customer service rep advised it is best to get a voucher for the tickets with BA’s book with confidence as she confirmed the visa suspension was an issues and BA are likely to cancel flights there.Luckily we booked with a travel agent and they are allowing us to rearrange our whole trip for a fee for later in the year, which we are thinking to go with.I am expecting holiday prices to go sky high after coronavirus calms down maybe paying the fee is the best option.."
i think it was actually post 23 . which is brutal in reporting value but i think some kindness is given as well to those losing their long term holidays today . so please understand peoples stress.
"Hi all We are due to fly out tomorrow from london arriving on 16th march. Based on the updates we should be able to get the entry visa but also considering my other options with BA and they are only offering me to change dates. I am looking to move to it to april or may but the difference in the holiday package is much higher, also weather in dubai might be too hot for us as also travelling with a 4 yr old. Any thoughts? Whilst we might be able to change to may the situation may not change and BA is saying that their policies are being updated daily."
you need to speak to your agent firstly as its likely you wont be able to travel then look at a full refund or future travel - dubai prices dont move that much if it helps.
"What worries me is the part where it says until further notice. If I moved my flight from early April to mid may and situation is same would Emirates still let those who can't fly change dates another time without fee. Address hotels already told me if I need to change booking then if new date is higher room cost I would need to pay difference. This angers me as it's not happening because I changed mind it's out of my hands so they should honour booking prices.Edited: 4:20 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"I know I said I wouldn't post again but if it is something I can help with without hyperbole then I am happy to do so and will private message too.My counsel would be that re-booking before October is probably no no and, however disappointing it may be to forego a holiday, the situation is too volatile. Add to that the UK's position with its objective of delaying the curve till the summer, which does not lend itself to other countries removing their ban on UK flightsI work in the insurance industry and because Corona virus is now classified as a known event, it is 99% certain that any future holiday would not be covered for Corona virus related issues.If you have goodwill from your airline I would consider that to be re-booking over a 12 month period and as for the Address if the booking was flexible then cancel it anyway. If it was non refundable and you have paid in full then wait a week or two and see if they have relaxed their rules. You may like to quote the fact that all major hotel chains are allowing re-booking to any future dates at no charge."
"Horroraddict - I’d try to move the date back as late as you possibly can. I think moving it back it only by a month or so will just add to the uncertainty. I appreciate your frustration as it’s not your fault but equally it’s not the fault of the hotel either. Dubai’s hotel market was vulnerable prior to Coronavirus but this could send it into free fall. I think Dubai was heavily relying on Expo 2020 - there is a strong likelihood this will be postponed and let’s face it, it’s going to take most economies a good while to get over this. I really don’t think The UAE would have taking this decision unless they felt it necessary given how transient a nation it is. I myself have lost out on two holidays this year, one with Thomas Cook and now my April visit to Dubai. Therefore I share everybody’s frustration and disappointment but l think Latimer has summed it up brilliantly and really this whole situation is far bigger than a holiday. Stay safe all .Edited: 5:08 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"please please read post 23 and 35 . no one can answer beyond these two posts Thanks latimer , hannah Shaun for all your help"
Yes I know situation seems like this won't be better by summer. However I'm holding out hope. I don't like thinking negative and saying don't bother going anywhere until October is just that. Not saying it's not possible it will take that long but no one knows what next week holds so can't tell people wait until October. Just my 2p.
We are travelling from the UK to Melbourne via Dubai on 27 March. I presume this visa restriction will not apply to transit passengers?
"Whilst I agree it’s best to remain optimistic you’ve stated yourself you do not know how you stand if you were to re book for 6 weeks time. I’ve postponed until much later in the year as there’s more chance of things being more marginally normal but I’m just taking a gamble also, I don’t know the answer I’m just going on the balance of probability! I guess only time will tell."
Double check but normally visa is only needed if you go past immigration
Yes The thing I don't agree with is someone random coming up with a month where they saying could be better by then.Just say I'm delaying until later in year Personally for me if I can't fly by July then I won't be able to go Dubai until march or April 2021. So keeping fingers crossed
Murphy2384 no as I understand if you are only transiting for 8 h or less and not leaving the airport you do not need a visa.
"You see that's why our situation on here is impossible - you try to help and make a suggestion to someone that has reached out for advice or guidance. If people don't want someone random (because that is what we all are) trying to do that then may I suggest that posting your request for advice to a group of random strangers will never deliver to your expectations as it will get responses from random people.October was a suggestion not an instruction.People have to take responsibility for their own decisions and take some ownership. If you don't like someones tone or the advice they are trying to give you then over to you.Make your own decision and then own it - book for May or June if you want and stay positive and optimistic. That is your call to make no one on here will say I told you so if its the wrong call because none of us will ever know.Good Luck and stay safe.For the poster Murphy at 39.Transit passengers - if they are still allowing transit passengers from the UK - then no visa is required for transit.However, at the risk of being labelled negative or without optimism (again) may I suggest that your biggest concern is the flight to Melbourne. No doubt you have the foreign and commonwealth office latest advice permanently open in your browser and a fervent hope that Australia doesn't follow the same path that New Zealand took today. i.e. to close its borders."
@latimer I wasn't trying to be rude. I mainly posted here to vent my current feelings about my situation.Your post came across as that when you said re booking before October is a no-no. My point is instead you should said you don't think it will be resolved by summer. That way people can't take it any other way.On other note I am not sure why UK government is pursuing this crazy route of herding. He wants 70 to 80 percent of UK to be infected but what about elders and people in high risk medical conditions like myself. Waiting for summer for peak is stupid in my opinion. That's when everyone wants to take break and go holiday etc. At least rest of Europe is trying not to drag it out that long.
"Tone of voice is always impossible on here.It actually says ""My counsel would be that re-booking before October is probably no no and, however disappointing it may be to forego a holiday, the situation is too volatile""So it's my counsel and probably a no no rather than a random trying to tell you what to do. As I say what people actually do is entirely up to them.As for the UK government then please don't get me started. We currently have a man that has been fired from 3 jobs for lying, will not admit to the number of children he has fathered and embodies the famous quote from James Goldsmith that ""when you marry your mistress you create a vacancy""He is also a man that persuaded 62% of the population that they shouldn't listen to experts who now stands in front of us all saying he is listening to the experts.I get the science and it makes sense BUT it has made us social pariahs and citizens of a country that most other countries don't want to receive and if we flatten our curve as he wants then our peak will not occur until early summer.It is a horrible time for many and there is so much that we do not know and everyone is trying to be optimistic.Example: today Jet 2 planes on their way to Spain turned round and flew back to the UK. Jet 2 then announced they were suspending flights to Spain for 1 week. At the same time the Spanish government announced a lockdown for 15 days so how Jet 2 expect to continue their flights in one week is beyond me.The stark reality is that this will go on for months and that is not me being negative nor is it fake news - just put UK virus curve into google or watch last nights News at Ten to see a graphic."
If you’re a tourist you get issued it on arrival
And here is a recent article if you would like get a bit more information - the curve is included.https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30567-5/fulltext?fbclid=IwAR0bY0Trc2TE-vn2qErtNyC2ptuCUS7Wwvp6XnoSsvlWNNsmccwYaq2n-Gg
I don’t suppose anyone knows if this affects transit passengers ... I was going to stay in dubai a few days before Bali but I could go straight through on 2 flights without leaving the airport x
I fly on the 16 th but arrive in Dubai at 7 am on the 17 th do not sure to cancel
For the poster at 49.Read the rest of the topic and then contact your airline if unclear.Are you definitely going to Bali is probably your first concern ?
"You will need a visa on arrival, and they are not being issued from 17 March according to news outlets in UAE therefore you will not be allowed to enter. I doubt they will even let you board the flight as you do not have a visa."
https:/…coronavirus
"What does it mean if I don’t need visa to entrance UAE ?? I’m from Slovakia, I have to go to UAE so not sure if they allow me to entry or no.."
#39I hope you’ve now heard that Australia has placed a mandatory 14 day quarantine on all arrivals.UAE is now not your main worry!
"I’ve read this thread and just wondered;I’m meant to travel to Dubai to visit a friend at the start of April. Am I able to get a visa before 17/03 to still go? Or is that impossible?ThanksEdited: 2:46 am, March 15, 2020 "
Not sure if anyone has seen on FCO web page that it says people with visas will be tested on arrival and asked to isolate for 4 days.
Oscar #50 - you won't get a visa. They aren't issuing them from 17th so you'll eithet be sent home or not allowed to board the plane.
We are also due to fly on the 5th April and unsure what to do. Cannot get in touch with Emirates to speak to someone. Now they have closed all Dubai Parks till the end of March. It’s looking more unlikely we’ll be going and I’m gutted but understand why.
Does this mean that if you go from Europe you can’t get in UAE as well? Technically you don’t need visa if you go from EU but you still get a stamp there which is a form of visa. Communication is really unclear what do you think?
"But can we apply for one before 17th? Or is it not possible?Edited: 3:45 am, March 15, 2020 "
I am due to fly on Monday the 16th and land on the 17th will they let me in?
Amy #61 - I don't think you can. But even if you did they're making you self isolate for 4 days on arrival.
Laura I don't think they will let u in as not issuing them from 17th.
Hamdi #60 - it says no visas will be issued and this will include the 30 day one or whatever it is you get on arrival. Only diplomatic passports are exempt.
"#63 - LauraThe rule is effective 'from 17th March'. So, if you'll be arriving on 17th March, you won't get an entry visa."
"@ Horror Addict - don't get sad, see the positives. For instance, should you rebook, your room rate may be lower.A couple of points for balance.1) Dubai/UAE local brands of hotels are far, far behind international brands in terms of maturity of customer experience/support. Whereas all the major chains - ie the ones with decent loyalty programs - have proactively and dynamically amended their policies, none of the UAE chains have. 2) The Dubai hotel market was already decimated before CV was even first mentioned. Most of the major local hotel companies are tied commercial with developers, and away from the hotel industry, most have taken big hits commercially - and Emaar is one of those.3) Emaar had already cancelled bookings on 3 of their hotels, outwardly because of CV but I'd also suggest the hotel occupancy and RevPAR challenges were also a factor. My tip for you would not be to rebook at this stage. I would go back to Emaar/Address and ask IF you rebooked and then rebooked again, would you still be covered. You can't be expected to pick a date that you can't know for certain if you can enter the country."
"I'd like to point out the importance of reading back through the threads, rather than re-posting the same question.# 39 - Murphy - if you're in transit, you're not clearing immigration (entering the country) so no visa is needed anyway.# 49 - TrollyDolly - see above"
"This is what i am trying to find and struggling to get this info. I have checked British embassy website, UAE embassy website but to no avail"
What info are you trying to find?
"Waaqa -you're not looking in the right place then.If it's the FCO page for UAE, try here >>>https:/…united-arab-emirates"
"Guys, rules are clear : no more visa (in advance and upon arrival). What is not clear?"
"We were supposed to travel from London to Dubai on April 13th. I know this is not going to happen.Is there an official statement on the duration of the visa bans?Edited: 5:34 am, March 15, 2020 "
"@ #74 - Espinozr. Yes & No. The official statement from Emirates News Agency was already listed here.If you'd have read back, you would have seen there is no announcement on duration.Edited: 5:47 am, March 15, 2020 "
Does anyone know who is responsible for reimbursing us now we can’t enter the UAE?Is it the travel agent (package booked through them) or travel insurance?I don’t want to rebook as have no idea when it would be safe to do so and prices haven’t dropped yet so changing dates comes at an additional cost
"See this:https:/…1239129095235043329Just to confirm I have just directly spoken to Dubai Immigration and UK passport holders will be issued visa on arrival as normal after the 17th call yourself for piece of mind 00971 4 313 9999 , see you on the beaches"
So UK passport holders will still be ok to go? What about the isolation period? I'm really confused now. Wish they'd put out an announcement asap.
"I’m assuming it means that you can still transit through but not enter. I should have been staying 2 nights enroute to Bali so I would have thought emirates will contact us soon but they haven’t updated anything on the travel section since 12 March which is pretty unhelpfulEdited: 6:38 am, March 15, 2020 "
"The flights won’t be cancelled as the majority of people on most Emirates flights are transiting through Dubai on to another destination, not people who are just going to Dubai"
"My head is spinning if I am going or not going, can’t get through to Emirates Holiday have phone stuck on my ear for 55 mins will have to give up in a moment. Anyone managed to get through."
Thanks for the update? Do you know if we still have the self isolation issue? We only going to be in Dubai for 5 days.
"What is the ""self-isolation issue'?If you read the FCO page, it says ""visitors will be tested on arrival and be required to self-isolate for 4 days""So, I'd take that as if you land on the 17th, you will be expected to self-isolate for 4 days. If you're only there for 5 days, and land on or after the 17th, it will apply to you.https:/…entry-requirements"

"I fly on the 16th (tomorrow) and land on the 17th, I have not been given any information from Emirates, I cannot amend my booking online and I cannot get through to contact them, can anyone give me advice? On the beach have said they can credit us but not for the flights and I can’t cancel online"
see the update postet above. uk passengers are allowed to enter dubaihere:https:/…latest-covid-19-update-15-3
Spoke to the immigration office in Dubai and was told that this does not impact visitors entitled to visas on arrival
Iv just read this so I’m okay to travel? Is anyone aware if we will be quarantined if we land and if so can we extend our holiday? Will Emirates be flexible?
What the flip Is happening ! Just spent a whole day coming to terms won’t be going on holiday and now this ? Everything seems dead over there have people I know living there saying parks etc are closed down now I’m double minded in even going at this time
"Looks like that news about the 'relaxing' of suspension of visas for certain countries IS confirmed, and not just on the Dubai Airports website.Hopefully, all the news sources will harmonise their message for clarity in time.As for if it's worth going, perhaps bear in the mind that the self-isolation will be expected to be complied with, and there will still likely to be more restrictions and measures implemented as days go by.Edited: 8:21 am, March 15, 2020 "
"All of this conflicting information is overwhelming! I guess what we can be clear on is UK passport holders can enter the Dubai. However, 4 day self isolation is still very unclear and from what i can see things are closing on a daily basis ie, spas, nightclubs, shisha ban etc. Probably best for everyone to weigh up whether it’s worth going now, and accepting the risks of isolation and Dubai having an increasing amount of places forced shut, or rebooking/getting a voucher for later in the year when this is hopefully over."
Value Added Travel told us we can still travel but I’m still concerned about being refused or if any of us show a temperature via thermal imaging. Also self isolating does that mean confined to room... or hotel complex ? We’re going to Marjan island ... and will be asking to reschedule til October
I can’t see anything on the latest Dubai Airports announcement recently posted about the 4 day quarantine. Surely this would be listed??
"The best bit of info I’ve read so far...https:/…Edited: 9:07 am, March 15, 2020 "
Yeah this mixed information does not help.So us UK folk can still get in but need to weigh up risks.My original booking still there so I will monitor situation and decide by 1st
"I think - and I'm guessing here - the reason for the slightly different messages is dissemination methods across different agencies. There was a big e-meeting/conference yesterday for consuls/ambassadors and I feel sure the 'compromise' on the certain countries was thus agreed as an outcome.This is perhaps why the FCO reported the 'latest' news i.e the 4 days SE, whilst Dubai Airports announced about the revised suspension terms, and even the 'official' news agency still hasn't posted an updated article.Considering Dubai's media stance and the proliferation of PRs in-country, it's still a blip that they couldn't all keep on one message. Even the local news sources seemed to have caught the 'update' via social media. To be fair, I think Dubai Airports had their hands full countering the 'fake news' that Emirates had *apparently* stopped all flights (rather than the few extra countries it announced yesterday).A top tip would be prepared for the worst, but hope for the best. Expect a period of self-isolation (as that's still FCO advice for entry to UAE). Don't be surprised if more announcements are made, and follow across a few trusted news sources.Edited: 9:41 am, March 15, 2020 "

I am supposed to be moving to Abu Dhabi to start a new job in April. British citizen but travelling from Turkey - will I be allowed?
Yes there’s a lot of conflicting articles out there so I’m just keeping an eye out for tweets & any emails. However I’mNot going for another 17 days and A LOT can change by then as we are all aware.
"Interesting new developments, good new for me at least.Our flight is in April so hopefully the weather has calmed by then and things have reopened slowly. This unfortunately does mean that I can not cancel the flight as booked through agency and they stand by FCO only for refunds (even if Emirates allows you to refund)."
"Due to fly with family on Tuesday 17th from uk. Anyone know if self isolation will apply, and if so what this means? Will it be in the booked hotel resort?"
"Out of curiosity, where does it mention self-isolation? I can only find a reference for 4 days on FCO but nothing on any website in UAE."
If anyone finds out the situation with the self isolation on arrival please update us!
"@Shaun I did so, but I'm just not sure where FCO pulled the 4 days from, if it's a separate meeting that no one knows about then fair enough, we'll hear about it tomorrow.I just could not find any sources on any website in UAE on these mysterious 4 days of self-isolation (and also, why 4? normally it's a week or two weeks). I think it's either a typo and meant to be 14 or someone mistakenly put it there.Edited: 9:25 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"@ Nabeel - we will never know where it came from, but I'm sure it wasn't a mistake.I did say to read back to give context as I explained about the meeting that occurred, which is perhaps where all this came from - it certainly changed the VOA situation.4 does seem a peculiar figure though, especially as 14 seems far more common."
