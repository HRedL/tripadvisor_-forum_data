"#4, I am not from Indonesia and I don't know their conditions, planned to be there in July, will find out later."
"Well, where are you now?"
"Hello to All, I hope everyone is safe and well. I am holding JR passes for travel that was suppose to take place in April. I bought them from Japan Experience and now I am unable to get in touch with them. Is anyone out there in the same position? Or, does anyone have some information that could help me?Thanks for your input."

"@ Trini B - your question really has nothing to do with the OP. It's best to create your own post. It eliminaes confusion.Edited: 11:05 am, May 08, 2020 "
>> now I am unable to get in touch with them.You can't call the UK head office? Their LA office? Paris? Berlin? Kyoto?
"#4,You are not from indonesia, yet your profile says you are from bali-indonesia?#3,I don't get you. You said AirAsia only let you make flight latest by October. Did you ask AirAsia, what would happen if by October Japan would still not allow foreign visitors? Did you ask them, whether they have flight available to be booked by October even though Japan is still closed for visitors by then?"
"Well, the situation with the ASEAN countries might change in a while.We owe a lot to them especially with the hard working jobs. I was served by a Chinese clerk at 7-11 and a restaurant a Vietnamese clerk. Most of the ASEAN countries seem to be handling this pandemic quite well.https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"
do you guys think japan will be ready for travel this december?
">>>Visa waiver programs have been halted.<<<Some visa waiver programmes have been suspended, not all of them."
"Japan Customs, I called Immigration. They said there are no visa waivers for any of the banned countries. One needs to apply for a visa through their Japanese Embassy. Need ""letter of invitation"" from a sponsor in Japan. And then a bunch of other papers explaining why they need to go to Japan. Send original documents by courier to the Japanese Embassy in the international city. They will send the papers to the Gaimusho (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) in Japan and vet, then make a decision. It could take several weeks. As an aside, Sands in Las Vegas pulled out of the ""casinos in Japan"" plan. They've been watching what happens when there are no ""inbound"" tourists. Since virologists are predicting another wave of infections in the fall/winter, I'm not holding my breath for ""back to normal"" international travel until there's a vaccine that's available to ALL."
