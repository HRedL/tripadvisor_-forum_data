"Has anyone looked into whether or not Covid is covered? I have done some searching and it looks like it is excluded from travel policies as of March. I am still researching but I think most companies will not cover expenses if it is Covid related. So, not sure why the TCI government would then insist on travel insurance as Covid is not covered."
"If you cant find a standard policy, you may need to go to a specialist in Canada or the USA as there are policies underwritten at Lloyds of London.Edited: 9:49 am, June 27, 2020 "
"Check with your credit card—sometimes they sell travel services including health travel insuranceAlso check with your home health insurance, some allow temporary add ons"
"Blamona I think you are missing my point...it appears insurance companies will not cover covid related expenses. It is not simply a question of add ons. it appears it will not be covered so requesting medical insurance by the government is pointless. We always travel with health insurance but it is highly unlikely covid will be covered. I will have to wait until Monday to make some calls, however Manulife, which is a big insurance company state on their website that as of March 5th 2020 covid 19 will be an exception from policies going forward."
"In March my annual insurance policy was amended to not include COVID-19, however as of June they have since included COVID into the policyYou will just have to shop aroundThis is UK based policy and as all Brits tend to go for insurance on medical when we travel maybe we are a little ahead of the game - worth noting as the USA is having a spike maybe you need to wait for it to settle before you will be able to insure and travel (even if your in Canada)"
"Blamona: What is the name of insurance company you use here in the states for travel, etc.? It might help someone on this forum. I am aware that some of us have medical then our employers but to include Covid, info might help. Thanks.Also, can check with our credit card companies ... which one do you use? Could save time on phone calls.Edited: 1:08 pm, June 27, 2020 "
"I wouldn’t rely on a credit card type of insurance - could be very expensive when it does not pay outReality is you need to get a comprehensive policy , maybe this whole pandemic will at least push folk to get proper cover Of course here in the U.K. we are blessed with the best health service in the world , but then everyone already knows that"

"Janet, the mandates insurance to enter TCI is TRAVEL MEDICAL insurance. It does not cover what you’ve forked out to stay in turks, cancelations, interruptions. The travel policy kicks in if you get sick once you’re in TCI, and covers medical costs, for example hospital, ambulance, quarantine. It only kicks in if you get sick once there, and does not cover any other TRAVEL cost, such as hotel, air, outside of being sick travel expensiveNot to be confused with regular travel insurance (that won’t cover covid, your right) for travel expenses, such as cancel trip, hotel, airfare, interruption of trip, hurricanes, etcPlease note they are 2 different types of travel insurance for different things. Many places have travel HEALTH insurance and can be purchased/added on at any time before your trip. TCI wants garuantee that if you get sick once there and have to either quarantine or go to hospital, you’re covered for that. They could care less if your vacation itself is covered or not. Hope this helps!"
"Blamona I understand what medical trip insurance is vs travel insurance. I do not need a long explanation as to what types of insurance there are. Again, my question is medical trip insurance appears to not include covid so regardless of having medical trip insurance if you get sick with covid you will not be covered. My understanding is the TCI want this covered so they are not on the hook for visitors and providing care."
"Blamona: which insurance companies do you use. Everyone understands why to have it.Janet: Good post.Edited: 2:37 pm, June 27, 2020 "
"There are currently three US insurance providers namely Trawick International, INF insurance and Global Underwriters who offer US Visitors insurance coverage for coronavirus. Please note that you MUST NOT wait to get coverage.https://www.americanvisitorinsurance.com/blo…"
"Janet I meant no offense, just many people don’t know the difference. I saw 3 different companies that did on We love fb page, and can’t remember now. A simple google I came up with a few companies. I have a friend got it through American ExpressI have another that added it (limited length of time) using their regular insurance. It’s out there, Mama gave a good link too."
"Janet, you’re correct. While Canada is still under a global travel advisory to avoid non essential travel, I don’t you’ll be able get it. Most, if not all, cancelled the coverage for COVID related as of March 13th."
"https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-s…""Canadian insurer Manulife Financial Corp. said on Thursday it will not cover trip cancellations or interruptions related to the novel coronavirus outbreak, after determining that the fast-spreading disease is a “known event.”...Travel insurance generally only covers cancellations for unforeseen events.Manulife’s change does not apply to customers who bought travel insurance policies prior to Thursday, a spokesman said.Policies that include “Cancel for Any Reason” insurance may also still offer coverage, depending on the terms, even after Thursday, he said."""
"Shannon, to let you know there’s a difference between travel insurance and travel HEALTH insurance. As explained below, the health insurance one only covers hospital/quarantine/maybe evacuation if you get sick once there. It does not cover any portion otherwise of your trip (hotel, air, interruptions, cancelations)TCI requires the health one. Big difference"
"In another thread about the TCI Government mandating that visitors have Health Insurance that covers COVID related expenses, I suggested that the Government itself may find a way to act as a Broker to allow it to sell this coverage to visitors directly. Although, as I stated in that thread, Insurance is only one part of the puzzle. Once COVID-19 is on the island, in any appreciable numbers, I think it will be extremely difficult for the Government to contain it.https:/…107067251Hope this helps! Stay and travel safe!"
"Dagny - maybe you should run for office, just need your belonger status first..."
Blamona - Janet already clearly stated that she knew the difference. My post was to clarify that they stopped covering cancellation and interruption due to COVID 19 NOT health. Please don't automatically assume I don't know the difference.
"Re: #17 I think you've misunderstood my post. My point is that during MERS the South Korean Government provided insurance, so it's possible, since the TCI Government doesn't have the funds to self-insure travelers that they can act as a Broker and link travelers to the Insurance the country will be requiring. Brokers earn commissions, so this would generate additional revenue for the TCI. Since I believe this is possible, I would not sweat the fact that individuals cannot source COVID Insurance right now. IF the TCI will require it, I believe they will create or facilitate a market and if they can't then it's probably too risky to travel.Stay and travel safe!"
Dagny: There has been some talk of the TCHTA (Turks and Caicos Hotel and Tourism Association) acting in some capacity for insurance. I know both the Tourist Board and the TCHTA are working with Government to put some kind of package together and/or set guidelines and procedures for having tourists come back.
"HB, can you update the forum as you find out more info? Would greatly appreciate it...thanks."
"Re: #20 thanks for the update and confirmation. That does not surprise me at all. At some point the island is going to re-open and an insurance company is going to do a risk/reward assessment. I wouldn't be surprised if the new normal is some cycle of open/close/open/etc. The truth is that is happening not just in US states but in Countries around the world:China strict-quarantined (locked-down) another 500,000 people b/c of a new outbreak:https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/co…FL/CA are closing beaches over the 4th of July Holiday:https:/…AZ is re-closing theatres, bars, gyms, etc AND NJ halts All indoor dining:https:/…Stay and Travel safe!"
"The issue isn’t any one insurance company it’s the country your in, fortunately here in the U.K. we have it under control and of course we have the back up of the finest health service in the worldTake care"
I understand that Medicare doesn't cover foreign travel at all but almost all Medigap plans do. Does anyone know if the Medigap carriers are excluding COVID?
Thanks Dr Jim. The carrier suggested that I verify with the provider that they accept US Medigap. I don't know who the provider would be. Would it be the national health service? And do you have any experience with them accepting Medigap?
"#21 maca, sure. But I am getting really, really tired of the trolls, all the nonsense and all the purely irrelevant info posted across all the TCI forums. I am technically a member of the TCHTA but have virtually no voice in it being east of the buoy. If I hear something I'll put it up."
"Thanks HappyBubbles, I appreciate it."
"Happybubbles: Feel bad for you. Really. Already posted on several forums. No one is traveling given all the restrictions. It is what it is. Why opine.? Unless anyone on this forum is a great doctor who can cure, dis cure cancer or diabetes. This is devastating to all. Many countries are involved."
Well under $10.00 per day per person at Apex Travel Ltd. Addresses ALL Covid-19 requirements from TCI Government and is TCI Assured. Cannot be beat!! https://apextravel.tcOnline tomorrow I’m told
"#27: Really? No trolls. If you have all the answers, questions are specifically asked on all forums, please tell us. You can do like a business plan, just state per item and the answer. I know you have read each question."
#31. How is your post relevant to the topic? You do realize your post looks like trolling right? https://www.travelexinsurance.com/ has been recommended by someone who just arrived in TCI.
"numbers, #31 Please help me understand. Are you suggesting that posts should be fact based and limited to the topic at hand?"

"To my fellow Canadian travelers, you may find the following website helpful: medipac.com (sorry, couldn't copy the link). Medipac is endorsed by the Canadian Snowbirds Association as well as the Royal Canadian Legion."
"I presume that TCI requires visitors to submit proof(s) of travel insurance to avoid the visitors becoming public charge to TCI government if the visitors get sick enough with Covid-19 to be hospitalized and/or evacuated from TCI to their home countries. When my family and I applied for our Travel Authorization via TCI Assured Portal for our visit to TCI for 10 days (July 24 ~ August 02, 2020), we prepared PDF files showing the images of our regular health insurance cards and a letter of travel insurance coverage from our corporate travel insurance provider which simply stated that the policy “includes a robust medical support program that includes medevac, associated quarantine support costs, medical ground transportation (ie: ambulance), and local hospital care”. The letter did not mention Covid-19, and yet our applications for Travel Authorization were quickly approved by TCI Assured. Those who would like to purchase travel insurance policies for their visit to TCI might find the following information helpful: “TCI Assured” website has a list of TCI Approved insurance companies such as Travelex, Seven Corners, Tripmate, Global Rescue, HDI Global, etc. The followings are Trvelex’ FAQs regarding their travel insurance: [“FAQ # 2. If I purchase a Travelex plan for an upcoming trip, what coverage do I have in regard to coronavirus? Coronavirus is being treated the same as any other illness. It is subject to pre-existing medical condition exclusions. An insured is eligible for Trip Interruption, Emergency Medical/Evacuation coverage if they contract the virus while on their trip.”] [“FAQ # 3. Would I have to be quarantined in a hospital to be eligible for coverage? There can be coverage if the insured is quarantined in either a hospital, hotel or vacation rental (i.e. Airbnb) while on a trip. A doctor would have to order the quarantine and this order would have to be submitted at the time of a claim, etc.”"
Another question for Americans: when you return to the states do you need to quarantine for 14 days upon your return?
"Thank you for the detailed information Jae! Much appreciated.Edited: 8:55 am, August 05, 2020 "
"Ryan (posting # 39). It's my pleasure. TCI Assured was very efficient, and TCI officials and people seemed to be in welcoming mode even though their entry requirements appear to be tough. They are just trying to protect their people and other visitors from possible Covid 19 infections through incoming carriers.The followings are my tips for those applying for TIC's Travel Authorization via TCI Assured Portal.(1) If you plan to apply for the authorization for the entire family, place the list of your family members’ information in front of you: (Names, addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers & expiration dates”. You will also prepare PDF files of everyone’s Covid-19 test report and medical insurance info. For efficient handling of the application process, you had better use only your e-mail address for all your family members. (2) Once you start your travel authorization application process by visiting “TCI Assured Portal”, the site’s timer starts. You are required to complete the application within the allowed time. Otherwise, you will have to start the process all over the again. Therefore, it is advisable to have all the required information at your fingertip. (3) You will start the application process for yourself first. Upon completing your own application, you will receive an e-mail from TCI Assured acknowledging receipt of your application. You can click “Next” on your TCI Assured screen or click the link in the e-mail  start your family members’ applications one at a time.(4) You must upload Covid-19 test results in PDF file for each member during each individual’s application session. [e.g. If you have 2 family members accompanying you, prepare 3 PDF files] [except children under 10](5) Health/Travel Insurance Certification: If your health insurance is a family plan with everyone else as your dependents, you can just prepare a single PDF file, showing the front & back sides of your regular insurance policy and the image(s) of your travel insurance certificate. A single PDF file for both insurances info is needed, because the portal gives you only one chance to upload the health info file. Since the entire family members in this case the same insurance info PDF file, you can upload this same PDF files for each member’s application process.(6) After completion of each application process, you will receive e-mail acknowledgement from TCI Assured. Shortly thereafter, you will receive Travel Authorization from TCI by e-mail which advises you to present the QR Code shown in the authorization e-mail to the immigration official upon arrival at TCI airport. Although you are asked to present the QR Code either in printed form or digital form, it would be safer to have the full authorization email with QR Code in a printed form, because the immigration officials asked for it. As for the Covid-19 test results, you had better print everyone’s test results from the lab, and present them to the official if requested. [Be sure to wear masks in public as required by TCI government.]Edited: 12:34 pm, August 05, 2020 "
"Wow- Thank you for the extremely thorough write up!We take our COVID tests 8/19 and are traveling on 8/24 as long as everything goes as planned and the islands are still open. Only 2 of us traveling, so I will make sure to have everything lined up as you say and hope for the best!"
"To poster # 38: We returned to NY airport on 8/02/2020, and we went through the immigration/customs process without anyone even mentioning Covid or quarantine. I presume that Turks and Caicos was not on the Covid risk country list."
To Ryan (Posting # 41): It's my pleasure. The beaches are very nice and the weather great!Enjoy your stay in TCI!
To Posting # 43: It's my pleasure. Enjoy your visit to TCI with beautiful beaches and pleasant weather.
"With regard to post # 40 and the process to enter TCI, has anyone from Ontario submitted the documents and gone? In what form are the covid test results given? Does it show your name or just an OHIP number? I am looking for guidance from people from Ontario that have gone through the TCI Portal experience. Thx"
