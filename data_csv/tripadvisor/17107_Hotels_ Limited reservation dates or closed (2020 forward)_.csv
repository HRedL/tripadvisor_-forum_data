This is a great resource for those who are planning a 2020 trip to NYC. Thank you!
"Teacher91. Thank you for your gracious note...and its encouragement to others to add their experience and opinions.If you wish, you can follow for a time the reviews of properties following new reservation dates to help assure your satisfaction.Edited: 12:29 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"Personally, I think those dates are optimistic and will likely change. Also, if I were in a rush to book I would be EXTREMELY careful where I booked, as some places are going to fold, no matter how eager they may seem to take your booking."
Do you think businesses will start reopening again that soon? I was thinking more July onwards
"I think the dates referred to are the dates they will start taking bookings again, not the dates the hotels will re-open. Estimates I have seen indicate the virus may not peak until June and then could come back in the fall. Personally I would not even consider making a booking for 2020 unless I was sure everything was already up and running and experts advised the virus was gone and not expected to return."
"Ok, I see. Our booking is looking likely to be cancelled, and we will be rescheduling for next year I think. As much as it’s disappointing we will look forward to next year when we are past this difficult time."
@4 No way is the city going to be back to normal by those dates. Cuomo was talking about several months of this. I wouldn't plan any trips to NYC at all until being given the all clear. At this point the best we can hope for is a treatment being developed to help minimize the damage.
Yes of course! Hence my previous post saying we will be rescheduling for next year.
"I have a September booking, at this point I would be surprised if that is a go."
"Yes, Cuomo quoted some health experts that the epidemic would go on for 4-9 months. The summer may be lost.Edited: 5:53 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"Good hotel thread again, Little.Things may change though, so expect that."
"Everyone's very helpful input and cautionary notes are well-taken. The dates as noted were taken from the hotel sites when a booking window shows it has opened--and may ultimately bear no relationship to actual dates of booking, occupancy or any aspect of hotel service. For those hotels and others, you have raised a fair question--how whatever situation(s) caused a pause--would significantly change by then, especially with developments in NYC within the last 48 hours and continuing. At the same time, it may have been a prudent decision for a hotel to pause and take stock of a number of factors in light of what may be its own, and these unique and exceptional external circumstances.We don't know. We may soon. ."
Aynat62: Thanks. I appreciate your note.
agree looking like a stay at home summer.
"We have two new hotels, a Hotel Indigo and the four star (!) Flushing Renaissance (Marriott) /Tangram due to open in May and June. I strongly suspect this will be put off. Flushing relies a good deal on Asian visitors which are not coming."

@17 i really hope you can use that reservation however I don't think it will be possible...as we all are doing...just guessing based on daily info we get via various sources.
The Maritime is closed to reservations through June 29.
"Sister City, on the LES, has temporarily suspended their hotel and restaurant operations. No mention is made of when services will resume.https://sistercitynyc.com/"
"Although no mention is made on the website, the Ludlow Hotel does not allow any check-in or check-out via their online reservations until July 1st 2020. https://ludlowhotel.com/"
I have just been reading the NewYorkPost where hotels are hoping to be back in business by July - https:/… Overly optimistic in my opinion. I fully expect to have to cancel the two options I have for July.
"If these current and future lockdowns work, and everyone abides by them, I have hope that things will be OK by September. July would be even better! Tough lockdowns are needed for a few months for the benefit of everybody. It's painful but I hope everyone can have patience and tough it out for a few months."
"I was supposed to be in NYC from Mar 28-31 and staying at Artezen Hotel. I hadn't canceled the hotel reservation yet, because it was nonrefundable, so I was waiting to see if the hotel would make a move first, before I tried to get a refund or credit. I got an email today stating that they will be closed through at least April 13 and will offer a credit to those with non-refundable reservations, good for one year."
Anything on the broadway plaza hotel? I thought I saw yesterday on thier site they were closed but today I'm not seeing that. We have reservations for june.
"The residence Inn Central Park will be suspending operations from Friday March 27th. See their web page for more details.Lisa, contact the hotel directly."
Great news today from DJT....things up and running for Easter!! Get those buffet reservations made. Churches will be full!!
Meanwhile cases in NewYorkCity are rising at an alarming rate.
Yes of course....saw a photo today of the lines at ER in Queens...I am sure it is the same at every hospital...on the hotel topic I am sure each and every hotel will be required to do a major deep clean etc. to get back up and running...July seems optimistic I am thinking more Sept. and it will take some time...business travelers will be back much sooner than tourists. Going to take some time for people to feel confident again.

"This seemed the best (open) thread to add this to...""These aren’t temporary bumps in the road. Peter Ward, president of the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council, told me that 95% of his 40,000 members would be laid off within a week.

It’s a billion dollars worth of real estate in midtown Manhattan and it’s closing its doors because they have zero convention business, zero business travelers and zero tourists,” Ward said. “They’re literally operating at below 10% occupied.”For perspective, says Ward: “9/11 was insignificant compared to this. Hotels never dipped below 60% occupied for 9/11, and that was only for a 20-day period of time.”nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-why-trump-is…"
The Four Seasons Hotel is offering rooms to medical workers. I thought this was a nice gesture under the circumstances.
#34 - Yes it will be good for those who have a (currently) impractical commute and those who are hesitant to go home to their families because they are worried about becoming infected themselves. (Have read things about medical workers self-isolating at home in basements and garages) Since few locals have that kind of space it's good they can have options that give some small measure of peace of mind about their loved ones as they continue to take risks to care for patients.

"Call me crazy but I'm an eternal optimist. I have not yet cancelled either my NY hotel or flight reservations for Memorial Day Weekend. I truly believe that the city will be up and working by then but I will only come if some resemblance of normal has returned and the safety level is okay. My heart goes out to all those affected by this chaos. I have an essential infrastructure job (ATT) and our driving culture ""shelter in place"" is quite different I'm sure than what NY is experiencing. Hoping for the best."

"It’s an interesting article In Post #36 KayeWhat’s being published a lot about hotels, is the question of staying open, closing or being used as quarantine accommodation. What hasn’t been covered much by journalists, is some of the other factors that go into the decision - namely the peripheral costs of of trying to keep hotels open, such as commercial grade deep clean of areas to ensure safety to all patrons - something that simply cannot be guaranteed or filled for a number of reasons.I had a first hand look at a hotel being prepared for use for quarantine (not for medical staff), and it was complicated. Having doctors come in, set up assessment stations in isolated areas, condoning off certain public areas, ensuring questionnaires checked by legal bodies, the language that has to be used when registering guests, mentioning of legal consequences of non-adherence - hotel staff are ill equipped and ill prepared with such short noticeI’m sure that city/ government authorities are doing what they can to assist, but at present, the reliance on the hotel to uphold and vigilantly maintain quarantine standards is low to non existent, especially when these hotels are barely above skeleton staffing I fear it won’t be long before hotels become small outbreak hotspotsEdited: 12:36 am, March 27, 2020 "
"KVE - I know it doesn't really answer you question but this clip of an interview with a man from our Army Corps of Engineers might be worth a watch https:/…The way I understand it, here they are planning to separate facilities into Covid and other uses and the field hospitals (and hospital ship) would be more suitable for non-covid patients (accidents ,heart attacks, etc.) How they might segregate self isolating patients and test results pending asymptomatic people I don't know. I would think hotels would be hesitant to agree to covid cases for reputation / PR reasons but more agreeable about other types of cases if needed. Places like the Javitz which are all concrete floors and hard surfaces might easier to confidently sanitize afterwards than hotel roomOK gotta get some sleep now."
"That’s some excellent information Kaye and good reading for anyone who has interest in the wider impact on the industry.Thank you for taking time to write that, and hope you are safe. Rest well"
"KVE - You're welcome - some of what I wrote was simply common sense guesses but I think they are reasonable.One thing I didn't notice last night was your mention (#40 above) of being involved in a hotel assessment (presumably in your home location). While I understand you may not be willing / able to disclose more details, can you comment any further on preparedness (government and otherwise) where you are and how the public is dealing with the situation there?"
"The very first voluntarily agreed hotel for quarantine in Sydney took place only two nights ago, and thus far it has proven to be a disaster. The hotel is a downtown 5 star, and rather than publicly declare their intention, they did so with absolute secrecy, with 290+ pax arriving in the middle of the night, and has caused a public spectacle. I can’t disclose too much but here is a crumb (QF6034). Two days later, the hotel concerned has yet to make any public statements, so the perception is that of a clandestine operation money grab, rather than a community service. The staff and management were ill prepared (staff given a ten minute brief on PPE equipment), with only minimal police and private security offered. And now they’re experiencing the difficulties for which they weren’t prepared. There are reports of guest rebelling to go outside to smoke, guests getting intoxicated in their room with alcohol they’ve brought in, wandering around the corridors and heading down to the lobby - and this is only their second day of the 14 day quarantine. There simply isn’t enough staff or police presence to maintain protocols. To compound matters, the hotel is not sole use - it has tentants that use common elevators, and there are also non quarantine guests still in-house.I’m sure that other hotels around the world in major cities will handle it much better, and also have better support of the local government. But this particular example is an unmitigated disaster,Edited: 9:24 am, March 27, 2020 "

Hi I appreciate there is more serious concerns for you in NYC and us in UK but if anyone has any info as regards RIU Plaza in Times Square as regards bookings or recent cancellations or general info during this unsettling time it would be very much appreciated as hotel website is not stating anything as due to stay mid June.Thank you and stay safe/healthy.
"Geordie: You are planning a visit to the colonies, and you want access to accurate and timely information. There is nothing more important than that. (We have had 240 years to get the act together.)I called for you, but the response was blunt; the office is “closed”, and was said to reopen on another date. But the hotel is an international chain, with another hotel under development in the Theater District and tentatively scheduled to open in 15 months. And these days requests for current information are, in a word, foreseeable.To summarize: the hotel website and customer service are a disappointment—worse, in many ways, than much or most of the 120+ Manhattan properties already identified with revised reservation dates. (If the website were an enigma, it would be a promotion.)A number of things could be said, but to struggle against obscurity, accompanied by the Sound of Silence, is futile. The complexities of virus impact and planning in the aftermath are one thing—but the level of communication about them by the hotel, when we are well into April, offers the stickiest of wickets.The best that can be said, which is insufficient, is your dates apparently have not (yet) been cancelled. (What it says about service, when and if you show up, is another story.)Consider making a refundable reservation elsewhere. Other hotels will be glad to hear from you. In the meantime e-mail daily, friendly but not familiar. And follow the website, even if it offers you mysteries without any clues.ANY response by the Riu Plaza management team might have been better—even if merely to say: “Hello. Just go away.” At least that would be connecting.Edited: 4:18 pm, April 04, 2020 "

"To take stock: Following the onset of COVID-19, an initial question was: how has the onset impacted hotel operations and reservations availability? 1. A search of all Manhattan hotels, reduced by those sorted as “ONLY AVAILABLE HOTELS”, yielded a partial answer: approximately 140 (approximately one-third) of 412 Manhattan TA-rated had paused to consider, and initially revised dates of operations, acceptance of reservations, or both. (The assumption was most if not all of those hotels were unavailable due to the onset, and not being sold out, as market conditions with lower demand had created lower occupancy city-wide.) The conclusion: as one might imagine, the impact was significant. However, apart from the hotels’ own assessments of operations/reservations dates, the limited data did not provide a basis for projection of future occupancy trends.) 2. As a next step, the thread did a survey and reported initial results of PROJECTED revised dates as follows.Post 32B: Open or opening by May 1Post 39: Opening May 1-May 10Post 48 Opening May 11-31Post 51 Opening June 1—futureSince then, further revisions have been made by the hotels, and other changes may be made in the future.Note, however: These posts only indicate hotels which changed schedules. To find other hotels which have remained open and have accepted reservations throughout and for the future, one way is to use an aggregator site, choose your dates, and limit your search to “ONLY AVAILABLE HOTELS”.] 3. As an update, this post will withdraw Post 32B, and substitute the hotels listed below. (The initial lists for other dates, beginning May 1, have not been reviewed since first listed.)After revised schedule: open, to be opened, or reservations accepted by May 1: : 1. Belleclaire 2.

"The hotels which have advised interim dates are taking a very big gamble by publishing/announcing even ‘anticipated dates’ so quickly. Should they get this wrong, it will be the trigger for more grief for themselves and their guests. Providing dates which could change, isn’t necessarily good service.It’s not as simple as just announcing a date and updating it as they go along. Doing so has a very negative impact. Doing so repeatedly can have a long term perception impact.Edited: 12:55 am, April 19, 2020 "
"The Hilton Midtown? Is that the one on Sixth Av? That has a lot of rooms and I think it would be optimistic of them to think they could come anywhere near filling it, unless they have some huge convention coming to town that wants to go ahead as scheduled.I'm not certain but I think the hotel formerly known as the UN Plaza, now I believe a Millenium Hilton, may be open. I have seen someone behind the front desk when walking by - but nothing else -- no doorman or taxis, though the sniffer dog and his handler are still out front (I believe there are also offices in that complex).And for the past week or so there's been a bunch of trucks and vans from World Central Kitchen, I think the Jose Andres charity, parked out front. So I assume people from that group are staying either at that hotel or somewhere nearby.Edited: 3:50 am, April 19, 2020 "
">>> That has a lot of rooms and I think it would be optimistic of them to think they could come anywhere near filling it<<<And this is precisely the problem hotels are faced with. As a general rule of thumb, a hotel needs to average roughly 30% occupancy to profit pre-tax. Anything below and it will cause a loss. This only takes into account operating costs such as staffing, utilities, perishables/wastage/leakage. Then you have administrative costs.Worse still, even when a hotel is operationally closed, it still needs to be ‘run’. Staff to take calls and enquires (even if taken offsite) engineering/maintenance (standalone property may only need someone to come check during the day, but those located in mixed business usage building, may need to have someone onsite 24/7) to oversee systems which cannot be shut down, security, and so forth.This is where publishing/announcing anticipated dates adds to the above. What does the hotel do? Announce it and keep dates open from that date? Then reservations come flooding in. Announce it and not show availability? It increases call enquires and emails. If they do accept reservations and the hotel cannot open by that date, then what? Hundreds of hours trying to contact guests to move, cancel, amend, refund, all of which can draw a very mixed reaction. Some are extremely understanding, others will see it as a premature call by the hotel or see it as incompetence that they announced it without better foresight."

"Re #61 In No. 1, do you mean the Fitzpatrick Manhattan, by Grand Central, or some other hotel? I'm not certain the Fitzpatrick Manhattan ever closed. In any event, I know it's open now as I walked by the other day and saw both people in the lobby and someone loading or unloading luggage in the street."
"Re: Post 64QQ2: Your question is a good one:The Fitzpatrick Manhattan is at 687 Lexington Avenue (56th-57th St). It is available May 1.The Fitzpatrick Grand Central is at 141 East 44th St., and is open now as you noted.Edited: 9:36 pm, April 24, 2020 "
"Right, it is the Grand Central one I walked by and that is open."
"Do your lists include the hotel formerly, and possibly currently, known as the Beekman Tower, at 49th and 1st? It must be open as every time I walk by I see people in the lobby -- several the other day. One advantage of a place like that at a time like this is (in addition to being recently renovated) it has kitchenette facilities, which would come in handy when so many restaurants are closed and most hotels' room service is either limited or not functioning at all."
"Re: Post 67You are right--the Beekman Tower on MItchell Place near the UN is open.You have hit a big point: at a time of limited restaurants, a kitchen or kitchenette can be an attractive feature. There is a top question that has a list of this alone--and a separate list of hotels with 2 queen beds and a kitchenette/kitchen which may be particularly appealing for a family. It has not been updated recently, but it has more than 60 hotels and it is athttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60…If you thought it might be appealing, and if you wanted to post your point as a separate thread with a citation to the link, I think it might draw appreciative attention."
"The Beekman Tower is also right across 1st Av from a good sized deli, something else I think is worth noting these days.Edited: 1:23 am, April 25, 2020 "
"Great work, very useful thread. I couldn’t find Hotel Beacon on list. I actually made a reservation back in Feb 2020 for Feb 2021 so all before COVID-19. I suspect the hotel will be open but not sure QANTAS will be flying to USA even then :("
"Flashman: Thank you, from all of the contributors. You are correct about the Beacon. When the list was originally prepared, the hotel was open and accepting reservations. Now, it will complete phasing in and accept new reservations beginning May 20.Edited: 3:46 am, April 25, 2020 "
^ Thanks LBO. Hope the great city of NYC recovers quickly
"Flashman: Your good wishes are deeply appreciated.Taking a step back, this is an introductory baseline, for three upcoming developments:1. How many of a little more than 100 hotels in May and June hold to current phase-in operations and reservations schedules.2. In the second half of 2020, what are :A. the trends in rates and occupancy; andB. What current hotels--IF any--alter operations or uses. .3. About one dozen new hotels are tentatively scheduled to open through the end of 2020, and about two dozen more during 2021. A vaccine may (or may not) be readily available in the US and worldwide by the end of 2021. Whatever happens: 18 months from now (and sooner) would be a good time to take stock of the impact of the developing COVID-19 situation on business/tourist travel, current lodging choices and the impact of new competition. New hotels--IF completed and opened as tentatively scheduled--could increase the current stock of Manhattan hotels, by the end of 2021, by a little more than 8%.Edited: 5:24 pm, April 25, 2020 "
The fact that not all hotels in NYC are on the list suggests a lot of hotels aren't closed at all? We ourselves have a cancelable reservation at the NobleDen in August but there is no mentioning of Covid measures on their website.  It probably won't make a difference as right now we feel like postponing the trip (if the airline is willing...) but I found it remarkable. @60 I really feel sympathy for smaller hotels that just started. But your remark makes me wonder: how profitable is the hotel business in NYC? Prices for rooms are sky high but this is all about high costs?
"Den: You are correct--many hotels are not on the list because those other hotels are open and are accepting reservations now. Just as one example, during the first week of May, on one site there are more than 160 hotels are available just in Manhattan. (Even for some on the list, they are open, serving all reservations thus far, but have paused accepting new reservations for the time being.)You hotel has availability from June 1 forward including all of August. (The hotel may not mention COVID-19, but it has paused accepting new reservations through the end of May.) .On profitability, NYC hotels recently averaged less than 20% occupancy, at or near a historic low. Very limited air travel and the issue of the virus may remain the same for the immediate present. While profitability will vary by property, it is not strong right now for most Manhattan hotels--and as about 100 more hotels open up reservations over the next 60 days, there will soon be further pressure on occupancy and rates. With a view toward the future, many hotel managers and investors may be considering the same question you raised.Edited: 8:27 pm, April 25, 2020 "
"Post #74It is a terrible circumstance for hotels in NYC, as they are caught in what’s often described as a perfect storm.Key Performance Indicators for January 2020 indicated an increase in every single aspect of revenue - top to bottom - but this is where the numbers are deceiving. In terms of bottom line results, hotels in NYC recorded losses in every category. Averages for gross operating profit and profit margin were in the negative by substantial margins (Year On Year), and costs for rooms, staffing and undistributed has all increasedAnd this doesn’t take into account the full effects of oversupply and the full impact of the virus, including the recovery"
Guessing January is not a good month for hotels anyway in NYC due to weather etc. Would be a concern if in general NYC hotels operated at a loss year in year out given that short term rentals are largely removed from the “ competition”?
"It’ll take about ten years to explain properly, so I’ll try and put it in a nutshellNYC is an extreme market to figure out, and typically takes 5-6 years to understand the nuances that affect the dynamics, which can greatly fluctuate year by year. Aside from the more obvious permutations and the ever increasing oversupply, NYC has had (for about 5 years now) an identity crisis and a saturation of sorts in upper end of the midrange market (4 to 4.5 star)Hotels who are on the lower fringe of five star cannot compete upwards because their product and target market is not the same, but also due to a fairly solidly established leisure market in the 3 to 3.5 star market, they find it difficult to compete downwards without long term financial impact. All of this, combined with increasing property taxes, labour costs, is having a crippling effect across the city. And it will take its toll.Edited: 2:23 am, April 26, 2020 "
Thanks for the answers. And compliments for the important information in this topic by the way!
"I have always been amazed by the hotel activity in Flushing. For years, we had only a few, but more recently, three have opened, two more are supposed to open and a sixth is nearing completion. The land has been cleared for a seventh, but no construction begun. I think there are two factors here. One is the proximity to LGA. The hotels nearest LGA tend to be somewhat isolated while Flushing has the subway, retail, and restaurants.. The other is catering to Asian visitors."

"There are continuing concerns about a ""second wave"" of covid 19 in the Fall. I think everything is wait and see at this point."
"Fox has raised a key point:In addition to the 30 hotels with new reservations schedules tentatively beginning July 1: a new wave of Coronavirus could bring pressure on many other hotels as well, with resulting impact on occupancy, rates and other considerations.Edited: 6:25 pm, May 05, 2020 "
"In light of COVID-19, more than 120 Manhattan hotels initially revised their operations or scheduling dates for new reservations. While approximately 4 dozen have reopened and/or are operating under current new reservations schedules (adding to existing hotels which did not change their operations or schedules), a number have extended their plan for reopening their reservations. The current projected dates and totals for reopening reservations are (approximately): On July 1: 71 moreOn August 1: 8 moreSeptember 1: 7 moreOctober 1-January 1: 2 moreOf 8 others: 2 are permanently closed (the Maxwell and the Times Square Edition) 6 others have no currently-offered new date to accept new reservations (Amsterdam Court, Bentley, Franklin, Marcel, Mayfair, Park West (formerly Astor on the Park).With these changes, previous lists in this thread are outdated. The current totals are subject to change.:Edited: 1:27 am, May 23, 2020 "
