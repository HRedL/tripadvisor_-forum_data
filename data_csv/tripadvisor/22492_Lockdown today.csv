What’s the situation in Dubai now? I had read they were starting to ease lockdown and open things up. Thanks
"there is a good link on here from the weekend with the guidance that was given, things do appear to be reopening but in very small stages. You can be out and about from 6-10pm but lots of things are on a small scale , Pools in hotel, and spa's and gyms appear to be closed until further notice. i dont think i would book anything until i thought they were def open ie the pools. Also currently Ramadan so will be more reserved for that reason ."
"this is the latest article about dubai reopening for tourists maybe in julyhttps://gulfnews.com/uae/coronavirus-dubai-c…and here is one about malls opening this weekhttps://gulfnews.com/uae/coronavirus-uae-mal…Edited: 5:16 am, April 28, 2020 "
Thanks. We are not booked to go until December so it gives me a bit of hope!
"Dubai is ever reliant on tourism and unlike most western countries does not have a welfare state as such so has no real fallback therefore it’s imperative that they get back to ‘normal’ asap however whether holidays will resume as they were before only time will tell.It depends on whether there’s a second peak later in the year, how flights are going to operate in terms of capacity etc and whilst most of us will be utterly fed up by the end of the year and will be desperate to get away I’d hazard a guess some nationalities might be more welcomed than others and giving The UK’s appalling death toll, I’m not sure us Brits will be welcomed with opened arms on foreign soil any time soon.I’ve wrote off two holidays so far but have everything crossed for my two later in the year but only time will tell!"
"Hannah we have written off 2 as well, the 3rd also unlikely... Dubai is my best shot!!"
good luck guys
"Well, Zero Gravity has opened up again and it's all hands to the pumps (sadly not the beer pumps in McGettigans - but that's another tale) to get 01 July going. Emirates are looking at that date to resume their passenger flights, and don't forget Eid is a big money-spinner too so that will be a better milestone to judge how inbound tourism may be realigning.The UAE was counting on Expo for 2% of GDP and with that not happening and the hotels already being on the floor revenue-wise before COVID-19, there's bound to be lots of incentives to help hotels and other hospitality venues rebound.@ GoaNewYear - it's worth adding a few social bookmarks to help keep abreast of the situation, and I'd start by following Ashleigh Stewart on Twitter as her daily updates are impeccable."
