That is a great posts. So many of us think of Arfica as a great safari destination and forget about the trials that this continent has faced. Particularly how hard the AIDS epidemic has hit these nations. Thanks for the update. I willcontinue onward in you journaling!
Great posting. thanks. Good to see folks looking behind the facade of a simple Safari and seeing Africa as well.
"I never tire of your photos around Arusha. And the Mama Lucy story is truly uplifting. I feel that the more I read about Africa, the more depressed I get about the seemingly hopeless situation there. It is good to know that small changes can make real differences in people's lives."
