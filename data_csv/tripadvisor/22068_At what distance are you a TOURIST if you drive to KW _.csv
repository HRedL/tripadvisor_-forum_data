So if you live in Key Largo and day trip it KW are you a tourist ? Just how many miles away before you are one ?
"A tourist is defined as a person who is traveling or visiting a place for pleasure. So, if Key West is not your permanent residence, you're a tourist."
Sure - you aren't a local and at that point what difference does it make.I'm a tourist when I go back to New York where I lived for over 40 years.

We need a coronavirus crazies forum.
Sorry did not read # 3 before it went down. Basically #1 said it best and was waiting on other opinions. I simply was curious about just how far you can be and not be a tourist. We lived just outside of KW about 28 years ago and did not think of our self as a tourist but now when we return then guess back to being a tourist. Just seems like if anyone in the lower keys go to Fort Zack beach that they are a local. Was not trying to start anything.
i live in North Jersey and have a home in South Jersey..I am still considered a tourist when I drive to south jersey (163 miles)
Guess we all see it our own ways. If we do buy another house to live in when in KW we rotate every couple weeks back and forth an be a tourist at both LOL.
Of course you are a tourist if you visit somewhere you don't live....no matter how near or far it is from you permanent home.
"If you live in Big Pine or Sugarloaf but work in KW you certainly are not a tourist. If however you live in Marathon or Islamorada and drive to KW once or twice a year for an afternoon and ask the bartender for a local discount because you live here all I can say is you likely are going to get an eye roll from locals that live in KW either to your face or after you walk away. Not trying to offend just offering what I’ve seen over the years. Nothing wrong with being a tourist, I for one enjoy meeting people from all over the country or world and consider it a benefit of Key West.Everyone stay home for now though so with manage this Coronavirus event."
"I'm sitting here with my wife in the Flagler Beach apartment we rented a couple of years ago. This is my third trip down this year, she has been here since January. She is a local, I am a visitor. I get introduced to the people she knows.Edited: 7:30 am, April 10, 2020 "
"That's an interesting twist. We live in Cape Canaveral year-round and have a good amount of the same snowbirds who come here annually. Some are owners, but most are renters. The couple in the condo in the building next to ours have been here since January. I don't consider them to be locals but they don't feel like tourists to me either. Maybe ""seasonal residents"" is how I view them. But yeah, they're also visitors because they don't live here. :)"
Does it matter?We are all tourists somewhere.
At most of the places we visit in KW they treat us as locals. Perhaps spending too much time in KW. Do hope they get the Corona virus under control. On bright side we are seeing the workers wearing masks more often. Just hope when over it gets back up running fast. Many workers likely have left if no job but they will return. Irma was nothing compared to this.As for us been called everything from locals to tourist and a few other things. When over am sure it will not look or be the same. Just hope they don't over fix up KW and harm the charm.This sitting at home is getting old fast.
I think if your an American your not a Tourist. Your just visiting another town. ~~/)~~
"So if you come from England, you're also ""just visiting"" - how does it make it any different if you're an American? You're still a visitor/tourist if you go somewhere you don't live."
Because Key West is in The United States of America. Just the way I see it. ~~/)~~
After 22 years in Tampa we would not really be tourist if we returned to Naples but would be taking pictures. Or I could go back to Pa.but would be lost after 47 years. No danger in my going back to Pa as I hate the cold. Naples we do miss the beaches..Do think I prefer the term visitor better.Our being Americans does not change anything.
"If you’re visiting (IE: you don’t live there), you are a visitor. I even consider us visitors when we travel an hour from home to the Smokey Mountains."
"""Because Key West is in The United States of America. Just the way I see it. ~~/)~~""So is Chicago. If I go to Chicago, I would be a tourist. I guess I am just not understanding your logic."
"I don't see the logic either. LOLBut this was interesting to hear all the views. When I was working was sent to many places but if I go back to see them then guess I am either a visitor or a tourist.Is always the option to rent a place in KW again and be a local LOLActually almost did buy a place 8 years ago in the crash. Simply put it would cost far too much in taxes, utilities and insurance. The total for our roughly 30 days a year renting a bed and breakfast is cheaper and prefer not having more property to take care of."
