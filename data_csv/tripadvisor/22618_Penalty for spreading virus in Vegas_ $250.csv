They should be fining people walking in crowded areas without masks.
Let's see....demonstrations and riots numbering in the thousands with no masks or social distancing OK.....religious services with excellent mask use and social distancing is not allowed...$250 ? GMAFB !
"crazies would rather have the us military and national guard ""dealing"" with people they disagree withvery much the same mentality as some of the resident crazies on here who were directly stating that they hoped anybody who disagreed with them got covid 19. truly pathetic."
That would be like fining someone for farting in public.
We have cities/counties in our area where the penalty for not wearing a mask is $50. Like that's going to stop anyone. Most probably won't even pay the fine. lol
$250Not to be sneezed at!
"Hermosa Beach has a mask requirement while in public in the business district and pier area. Most people don't wear them. My wife, friends and I saw a guy who was drunk and crashed in bicycle into the media then fled. We think he stole it so we called the cops. The cops didn't have on masks, neither did we. Even in LA many of the cops I see aren't wearing them, despite being two to a patrol car. If anyone ever tried to give me a ticket, I wouldn't pay it. What are they going to do? My city lets actual criminals out. https:/…"
PnsId move out of LAHehehe
You must be so proud that you're not wearing a mask. Just wait until you have that ventilator down your throat. You won't be so proud then.
"LOL. What is people's obsession with ventilators? Desert Girl, my wife works around COVID samples. Worse stuff than that actually. If one of us ever got it, we would quarantine, get hydroxychloroquine, z-pack and zinc and would be fine. That is if we even noticed we were sick. There are far far worse things in this world to be scared of."
"Trump, the Coronavirus Whisperer... taming the virus 1000 deaths at a time."
"There goes pnis giving false and dangerous advice yet again. $250 pp? That’s tiny. Charge them each 2g’s and throw em in jail and give them a trial. Hawaii has stepped up their covidiot searches because our numbers are sky rocketing due to people thinking the worse is over and have been partying like it’s 1999 at homes , bars and beaches. Now we are shut down again and with hefty fines to follow with zero warnings anymore. We are past that. The evangelicals and the host knew they were wrong by disregarding the city / state mandate with the number of people allowed to congregate under 1 roof That many people under 1 roof Oh boy were they praying for a miracle and it to be gone poof just like that ? People who were demonstrating and protesting were not all without a mask. Many, infact most were very well organized and sported their masks. Plus they were protesting for true equal rights not a rally to share spit and the blood of their Jesus to keep an orange monster in the office Increase the penalty And no I dont wish you deniers, conspiracy theorists and republicans ill. Not at all. But it’s very strange when people on here swear to be experts and give false and terrible advice or sharing their dare devil experiences. But history always has a way of repeating itself. ShameEdited: 10:57 pm, August 07, 2020 "
"A huge push with contact tracing and testing managed to control outbreaks in South Korea. People stayed home more and always wore masks when out. 51 million people and 300 deaths. They have a pop. density of over 1300 per sq. mile. The US has 92. Seoul has 42,000 people per sq. mile. Their first case was about the same time as the US first case. We have 6 times the population but 533 times the deaths ..160,000."
"But Hawaii has some of the strictest restrictions, it is islands, and is mostly Democrats. So what really went wrong? Oh yeah your islands require masks. Hawaii needs tourism, just like Vegas. Sturgis, SD understands that. You either make money or you go out of business, go broke, and eventually live on the streets. Make fines for not wearing a mask $2000. So what? You don't quite understand the utter contempt I have for my local and state government."
"Yes we “had “ some of the strictest and we did great. Until we opened up , even slowly , and locals went ballistic throwing huge parties. Everyday when I drive by the beaches it looks like the 4 th of July. No social distancing , no masks and no one following the mandatory less than so many people at one location, under one tent etc etc. so we’ve seen our numbers go from down to zero ( which allowed us to switch to different phases ) then up to double and now in tripple digits in the daily for a week now The penalty here for quarantine breakers can be up to $4,000 plus a night in jail unless you place bail and a ticket straight back to where you come from. However normally the fine has been between $1000-2000 in actuality Now our local law enforcement will be citing , arresting and Fining our locals who do not follow the citing and state mandates while we shut down many areas of public use and some type of businesses. However we have kept open establishments and businesses who have been adhering to the rules , kept their customers and clients safe and where available, contact tracing did not list those places as outbreaks or links to cases. They feel why punish places and businesses who are doing it right. Hawaii needs to rethink a lot of things and there is now a push to invest more into sustainable agriculture and not so heavily into tourism. Hawaii and our islands were not inhabited to turn a profit unlike Vegas that was created just for that , turn a profit tourism and gambling.Edited: 11:15 pm, August 07, 2020 "
"And no Pnis our influx of Covid positive people are not because they were wearing masks, but because they were not Infact many are traced to people who took trips to the US Continent during a pandemic and returned home infected , then went about to funerals ,friends houses and parties bars and beaches enjoying social time without their masks And yes we are predominately Democrat here. Things tend to be that way when the minority race tends to be white and majority non white and when the left matches more closely to our societal views and cultural expectations for equality and basic human rights.Edited: 11:21 pm, August 07, 2020 "
"""No Plan"" Don. There’s no substitute for government leadership defining what should be done and making it happen. Trump failed."
"And yet in all these years of voting Democrat, how exactly do the native Hawaiians live? Do they have the best jobs, live in the best neighborhoods, as a majority of course? Or, like black and Hispanic Americans are they generally relegated to the absolute worst neighborhoods, jobs, etc.?If something wasn't working for over half a decade, I'd change. While the GOP for a long time ignored minority voters, they didn't try to keep them impoverished and on the government dole either."

"I removed my two posts following PNS responses because I realized I was being just as ridiculous as he was . so instead of bashing him I decided to remove my posts.Regardless of your political affiliation, you should be able to understand the reasoning for the penalty for anyone not following the law.What's so hard about that?"
"""Hawaii needs to rethink a lot of things and there is now a push to invest more into sustainable agriculture and not so heavily into tourism.""Push by who ? Certainly not by anyone who makes a living off of tourism. Lots of complainers but no real serious effort or action to change anything much."
"Bring back the sugarcane and pineapple industries.Edited: 8:50 am, August 08, 2020 "
"But then again, you’ll always have ppl who don’t want to follow the rules. Look at all the ppl sitting in prison, yes their crimes are different but they didn’t follow the rules and laws that are set in place. So I don’t really think that a lot would care about the fine. They will continue not following the rules. It’s just so easy to wear a mask. I don’t get it."
"""Bring back the sugarcane and pineapple industries.""Yea, bring those back because those companies must have been getting rich on those.....oh wait, maybe they weren't. Maybe that's why they are not there any more. Probably not going to bring them back either.Actually I think there is still some pineapple production on Maui and maybe other islands too.Edited: 9:50 am, August 08, 2020 "
I’m confused. The people that want to disband the police seem to be the same people that want a police state for enforcing mask rules.

When I was a kid I loved that C&H jingle. C&H the pure cane sugar from Hawaii. In the pink package. Bring back the cane. Ban the beet.
"“ If one of us ever got it, we would quarantine, get hydroxychloroquine, z-pack and zinc and would be fine.“You forgot your pint of bleach!"
"""Vtgambler, Do you think it’s a bad thing to enforce the mask rule? Just asking.""I think people should wears masks where prudent. I think private businesses (ie casinos) have the right to require it. I'm don't really want giant fines or jail time for people who don't put a piece of cloth on their face. Particularly when every state and locality seems to have different, constantly changing rules as to where or when you have to wear a mask or how many people can have in a space at a given time."
To be fair we do keep bleach around the house. It would be useful to disinfect things. It is important to have a supply of things like that since we live in an area that gets earthquakes. Seeing how people decimate store shelves in an emergency should be a wakeup call for everyone.
"The ironic thing about defunding the police and mask orders is thus.If the police are defunded, no way are they going to be involved in providing mask related tickets. Armed officers would only be used to attend to the most serious and dangerous situations. This leaves unarmed civilians to hand out those tickets. Yeah, gonna listen to them lol. I know one doctor who keeps harping on having the National Guard enforce mask mandates. Yep, go from cops whose training is to generally talk through conflict and who carry 9mm's to soldiers in combat gear with M4 rifles who are trained to subdue and if necessary kill the enemy. That will make things better lol."
"“ Particularly when every state and locality seems to have different, constantly changing rules as to where or when you have to wear a mask or how many people can have in a space at a given time.”This is the easy part. Just wear a mask when you’re inside any establishments outside of your home . And outside in places where you can’t maintain social distances.It’s up to the business owner to enforce capacity rules. If you do this, you don’t need to worry about local regulations."
"So officer Irish, do you think it is up to the business owner to enforce mask rules ? How would you recommend they deal with customers who refuse to wear a mask inside the business ?"
@35 Why a z-pack? Totally useless for COVID and colds and the seasonal flu@37It should be the business owner enforcing masks. Non compliant won’t be served and removed from the premises with force if necessary.
Removed from the premises with force by who ?
"It's something for which compliance would pretty much be impossible to strictly and consistently enforce. Here in the UK at least, although it's been mandated in certain circumstances our government never really wanted to do this, because once you do so then you have to at least appear to be addressing issues of non-compliance somehow. No one wants police spending time doing this sort of thing, so the buck (sorry 'responsibility') has been passed to those such as shop owners, public transport operators, etc. Which isn't really working.It's a no-win situation really. The government hoped that by 'recommended' people would act responsibly and comply with the recommendation to wear masks, but instead some interpreted this as 'optional'. So the government then moves to make it mandatory (in some circumstances) but with no real hope of enforcing that mandate."
"“ It should be the business owner enforcing masks. Non compliant won’t be served and removed from the premises with force if necessary.“Unfortunately true.Too many crazies thinking it’s OK to harass some poor employees who are just trying to make a living. And the employees, of course, had nothing to do with the mask regulation.So they need to call law enforcement. And this takes law enforcement away from dealing with more serious events.It’s funny I never saw people giving crap to cashiers about wearing a shirt or shoes."
"Law enforcement will not respond to those calls. They have better things to do and besides that most law enforcement in major socialist cities has been defunded. So now, who you gonna call ? Ghostbusters ?"
"@William BAzithromycin can benefit a COVID patient in a few ways. Firstly, some COVID patients also get bacterial infections in their lungs, Azithromycin is useful in fighting that off. Secondly, it can help reduce overall inflammation of tissues. Thirdly, two proteins have been proposed to be the cellular receptors of COVID-19: one is CD26, a marker of senescence, and the other, ACE-2, is also associated with senescence. Z-pak selectively removes approx 97% of senescent cells. Without those cells acting as host receptors, it may be harder for COVID-19 to take root in the body and cause serious damage."
Congratulations to all the 2020 graduates of the TripAdvisor Medical School!
"@placebets the push have been by local people as well as certain representatives some of us are trying to get in. The push for sustainable agriculture would create 1000's of jobs, allow locals to eat healthier, cut down on prices on food that we would now be able to grow ourselves in our rich volcanic soil versus paying hefty fees and prices to ship it over from the continent and would be safer for the land as well as reallocating the tourism promotion budget to fund a pilot civilian conservation corps program in the uplands and targeted farming and aquaculture programs along the plains and makai areas ( ocean / near water areas) .Pineapple and sugar cane made foreigners and melanin challenged people rich while decimating the soil and paying pennies to the workers.Hawaii is also looking into sustainable tourism where we would support a tax on air travel to subsidize the cost of planting sufficient trees to mitigate the carbon footprint of each air traveler to Hawaiʻi. As well as assessing a visitor fee like New Zealand does, to offset the environmental and social impacts."
"Yes Irish, I anxiously await their next tutorials. They really don't how ridiculous they sound."
"LOL. Yeah gonna pay more for a trip to Hawaii so I can have the few locals who still have well paying jobs glower at me because I'm ""melanin challenged""."
"Angelina well you keep pushing for those representatives because they would sure have to beat what you have in there now.Keep me posted on how all of that is working for you will ya""?"
"Dang,this sure has been an interesting bunch of remarks. Makes me want to rush out and plant a tree or something. Ive heard that Sweden is doing well now despite their not taking the extreme measures that others have. And dont ask me where I ""heard "" it. May have been any one of a multitude of places. I can't wait to see the Liberals don their masks next year when the flu /influenza rolls around to kill tens of thousands of us."
"""Hermosa Beach, most people don't wear them, I wouldn't pay the fine"" You should take a walk today, put your money where your mouth is. They have extra officers around this weekend dishing out the $200 fines for your first offense."
"""Law enforcement will not respond to those calls""Of course they will, they do it every day. As soon as the store tells you to leave and you don't, you're trespassing. It's therefore a trespassing law that you're breaking, not a mask law."
"@tjp60""More than 5,500 people have died with Covid-19 in this country of just 10 million. It is one of the highest death rates relative to population size in Europe, and by far the worst among the Nordic nations. Unlike Sweden, the rest all chose to lock down early in the pandemic.""BBC"
Pnis just don’t come before we eat you like we did captain cook
"""I heard Sweden is doing pretty well despite not taking extreme measures"" Oh really? You HEARD? Well I heard that the earth is flat that doesn't make it true. Did you hear the same baloney about Brazil? Because you would then be wrong about both countries. Per capita Sweden has more death than the USA, and five times the deaths of neighboring Finland or Norway. And Sweden is nowhere near reaching ""herd immunity"". Brazil is too much of a mess to even talk about. What a damn tragedy."
@placebets. Wish us luck. But you follow Hawai’i forums anyway so I’m sure you’re well versed in all things “Hawaii” from the “forums” bravo
"If it doesn't involve an active physical altercation, responding to a call about someone not wearing a mask is going to be verrrrry low on a peace officer's agenda. They will respond, but it could take hours. The average length of time here for police response to a non-emergency situation is over 2 hours. They're busy enough with serious crimes in progress.Home invasion, physical assault, robbery, not wearing a mask..which do you think should be the priority?"

"angelina yes I follow it closely and have for years. Frequent visitor there as well.

"This is silly. If a hotel books a wedding for 150 people, do you think they are going to care about this fine? They will just add a $250 Covid Surcharge to the bill.Any penalty has to be enough to matter. Heck even the death penalty isn't always effective.With apologies to Jonathan Swift, I have A Modest Proposal. For transgressions against society as a whole, including planning large congregations and possibly even not wearing a mask in public, I recommend we consider castration.I understand that the procedure is much easier than it used to be. And may not even be considered cruel and unusual punishment any more. That is a penalty that might actually be somewhat effective, And it shouldn't take many. A few public procedures should do the trick.Of course some people will probably still claim that it's not much worse then the normal flu."
