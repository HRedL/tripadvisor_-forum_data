"Check with your travel insurer but in all likelihood no, you won't be compensated. I'm sorry your holiday was spoiled by this unprecedented global war on this global epidemic."
I doubt you'll get any compensation.
"There is nothing to stop you trying, but I am not even convinced these companies are going to survive, so it'll be academic then anyway."
"Pam, with everything that is going on in the world at the moment, people losing their lives and livelihoods do you really think your question is appropriate"
"Compensation? I really am quite shocked that anyone could be asking this. The whole situation is changing so quickly and no one could have predicted this would become so bad so quickly.There are no winners here. Business will fail especially airlines and travel companies and yet you want them to pay you compensation? You chose to go on holiday knowing that there as a pandemic and the situation was changing daily. I’m sure it’s disappointing but you have been given advice, you have a return date and at least you have sunshine. I do hope you will self isolate once you return home."
"The most recent UK 'most likely' model for the virus had 250k people dying, but hey, a closed pool and gym is more important right?"
Glad Pam has removed this. Must be one of the most insensitive posts.
"In the 90's there was a devastating cruise ship disaster just off the South coast of Finland. When other cruise ships turned around and headed that way to help, apparently there were some passengers that were asking for compensation because the disturbace/delay of their own trip."

I don’t think there’s much fun to be had anywhere in the world at the moment. Perhaps we should all be compensated?"
