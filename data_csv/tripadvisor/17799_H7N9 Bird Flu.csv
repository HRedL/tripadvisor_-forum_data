"Just starting to see reports of this coming out.. 5 deaths so far, mostly in the Shanghai region... We've got a trip planned for the end of the month; plan on coming as long as there isn't a CDC travel advisory.... anyone have any thoughts?TDW"
Don't think you would find much information as there is a massive cover up like the SARS case.
"Do you have some evidence of this ""massive cover up""?"
I agree with JP.
"3 had died from it but so far there is no direct evidence of cross transmission between the contacts.It is largely confined to animals and as the latest findings it has undergone some mutations when it infects some other livestocks.The infected livestocks has shown no ill effects as of now.There is no conspiracy and coverups.No need to get paranoid about it,not all of us are coverups when it affects our own lives because in China we do value our lives and those around us too.So far 9 had been confirmed cases.This Qingming my family will go vegetarians as we were advised not to slaughter chicken or pigs.We will go tomorrow for the Qingming."
"H7N9 avian flu in China has hit the news here in Australia. The News is reporting 5 deaths with no relationship between the victims. There are others under observation probably close friends and family of those diagnosed. As yet (we are told) they show no symptoms.We're leaving for China on 14 April and will be in Shanghai on 18 April. We're certainly not considering cancelling our trip. From what I've read the virus does not survive in cooked poultry. I remember when we were in Vietnam in 2006 we avoided chicken, duck and eggs. It's important that eggs are cooked properly.A few years ago the Australian government provided free vaccinations against Avian flu. This is a new strain so I'm unsure whether we would still have some resistance."
"Doesn't make any sense avoiding certain foods... Flu is an airborne infection as are most of respiratory viruses. You have to inhale viral particles to get sick. Avoiding poultry and meat markets, processing plants, farms, slaughter houses would make sense...Hopefully there won't be human-to-human transmission... It will be hard to avoid crowds...P"
That's true but scientists do say to avoid raw or soft cooked eggs. After all they grow viruses in eggs to produce vaccines. Today I read that the virus has been detected in pigeon samples collected from a market place in Shanghai. The concern at the moment is that the source of the virus hasn't been identified.
"Just did an article about the Birds,fish and animal market at Wanshang,Xizang nanlu few months back.Ooops.I always have the flu jab annually but this strain seems to be different from the H1N1 or the H5N1.Hopefully a proper vaccine could be available soon."
"I've just been watching an interview with a Professor. The vaccination we had was for Swine flue so I don't think that will help us although there is talk about the possibility of this current flu in China coming from pigs. He said it will be a concern (obviously) if there is human to human transmission which doesn't seem to be the case at the moment. He said the situation is still unfolding. Sorry Benny I don't think your previous jabs will be of help, neither will ours. Taking care with hygiene and staying away from live animals is probably the key."
"Ah, SARS of 10 years ago. Never will I forget living through those bizarre months during 2003. That cover-up was massive until the gov't couldn't keep a lid on the story anymore after foreign official Pekka Aro died in Beijing almost exactly 10 years ago today. So far, I'm not seeing parallels between how SARS was dealt with then (not dealt with until too late) vs this new bug now. Seems to me Chinese gov't is a lot more out in front on this one. People are less trusting and social media and technology makes it harder to keep things like this a secret.At this point, I wouldn't worry too much and wouldn't let it disrupt a trip. I do advocate (as I have for years) that people stay away from live animal and bird markets of any type. If this thing starts to be able to pass easily from person to person, then maybe worry. I think it's too early to know how this will play out.Edited: 7 years ago "
"We will be landing next Friday in Shanghai, we'll take precautious like having face mask all the time, hand sanitizers, and avoiding raw food and birds (chicken, ducks, pigeons) as well as daily doses of vitamins to boost immune system. We hope it doesnt become an epidemic or worst still pendemic. We will surely be monitored at the airports when we leave shanghai and return home i guess."
The problem with this one is that the birds don't necessarily die from it and can appear quite healthy - like a typhoid mary --- so the natural warning has gone apparently in the latest news here
Landing in Shanghai next Friday. Is there a danger. Should I not come. Help pls
"Guess we'll be landing in Shanghai on Tues 9/4/13 as the travel agent says we CAN'T amend our tickets at all as there's no Travel Advisory etcGuys - what's the BEST/fastest WAY of getting to ␣␣␣␣␣␣ SUZHOU WUZHONG BUSINESS CLUB HOTEL0512-66591882 directly from our Shanghai Hotel - which could be 正地豪生大酒店或同级021-20218888 www.hojochina.com or similar ?

"Anish, I don't think we intend to put anyone off their trip to Shanghai. We'll definitely be going this month. The message at the moment is there is no need to panic. It's best to be informed and there's plenty of information on the internet and here in Australia on the news. Two of the deaths actually happened back in February but have only now been publicised because it took health professionals awhile to make a connection to Avian flu. From what I heard there were quite a lot of deaths in the US this past winter from a nasty flu. Last year when my husband and I got home from the US we came down with a severe respiratory infection.Joanna, Your post is a good distraction on this thread!Edited: 7 years ago "
"HR departments here advise their staff to take normal hygienic precautions even more serious now. Wash your hands frequently, buy a hand sanitizer and use it frequently, do not eat raw animal products, do not visit animals markets if you don't have to. Have a look at what your foreign office says. During SARS there really was a big cover up, but during swine flu I found that Chinese media was a bit too hysteric, just to avoid that their people claim they did not do enough. Same this time. So get a good mix of coverage from local and foreign media. Also talk to expats in bars/restaurants. I always say it's like in a plane during turbulences - it only gets serious if the cabin crew does not smile anymore ;-)"
I think you don't need to worry about that. It will be gone soon!
"The number is very small, this time the media gone the opposite way from early stage SARS reporting. My staff was going to buy air tickets for my next China business trip, I told them to hold and wait a few weeks on all company staff. Everything is okay, don't worry, remain calm; but I am not going. We had the same early stage response when SARS was reported. When there is a doubt, wait and see."
"Chance of getting infected is very very low, even during SARS period. What one has to worry is the possibility of being quanrantined."
"Glad I found this thread! I will fly into Shanghai on Monday, so far I am not very concerned but definitely will stock up on hand sanitizers :)"
It's all over the news here. Still no person to person transmission. The toll is now 6 and I've read and heard conflicting reports of a seven year old girl in Hong Kong with symptoms after visiting a market in Shanghai. I read she tested negative but the report on the TV news didn't say that.Just keep informed and stay away from live poultry!
This is the official update:www.who.int/csr/don/2013_04_05/en/index.htmlSo Tamiflu should work.PEdited: 7 years ago 
"I live in Shanghai and the situation is normal. If Shanghai is ever normal. I have three kids under 6 years old so it's definitely something we are keeping an eye on. If it looks like it's heading to epidemic proportions then then we would consider holding the kids out of school or perhaps even leaving Shanghai for a period of time but it's nowhere near that level yet.It seems like most of those that have it have had direct contact with poultry. So perhaps wipe that trip to the wet market or the bird market off the itinerary. So far at least, you should probably be more worried about regular flu that this one since the regular flu is so much more widespread. This is being reported widely in the papers and on TV locally which is a change. Hopefully it won't amount to much but I'm watching closely."
A lot of poultry has been slaughtered in the markets. Will poultry still be available in restaurants? We are told it is safe to eat if well cooked. I imagine the industry will avoid slaughter for fear of contracting the virus particularly since birds appear healthy even if contaminated.
It wouldn't be a trip to China without duck!
"It has claimed 6 lives 2 in Shanghai and the other from Jiangsu.So far the government is been very transparent about it and precautions and early measures like culling of lifestocks particularly pigeons and chickens have been carried out at high risk markets.Hopefully it doesn't mutate and spread among humans.,as this could have occurred anywhere.If it were able to spread among humans in no time this would spread worldwide just like the SARS did."
"Best and only advice ,do not visit animals markets if you don't have...This will take care as far as I know...."

"#32 Anish - We will be flying to China on Sunday and to Shanghai on the 18th. I see no reason to cancel, there is no epidemic.Last time we were in China I caught a very bad cold. I'm more concerned about that happening again."
"I will say it is true that 16 cases found and 6 are dead, quite serious issue, stay out of crowd and not making contact with birds, live chicken, duck and others, try less or avoid poultry meals. excessive panic is not necessary, stay alert is a must. We will make through."
"If you read the links provided above you will see that the virus doesn't survive in properly cooked meat.It is impossible to avoid crowds in China so practice good hygiene, wash hands frequently."
"Above I wanted to say:""At best this means that H7N9 responds to Tamiflu ""in vitro"", unfortunately that does not guarantee that it also WORKS IN infected humans..."""
"The Australian Prime Minister is in Shanghai at this very moment, speaking to journalists and mixing with lots of people."
"18 cases confirmed so far,8 in Shanghai and 6 in Jiangsu province and 3 in Zhejiang province and 1 in Anhui.6 deaths with 4 in Shanghai and 2 in Zhejiang.Cases still doesn't show any mode of human tansmission ."
A new flu vaccine has been developed but yet on trial by the Chinese authority is called peramivir.Tamiflu doesn't work in these cases.
No need to cancel your plans.I am still conducting tours as normal but more selective on the food I provide.No signs of any concern on my guests.
"Benny,,it's not a vaccine, it's a drug similar to Tamiflu. It takes at least few months to develop vaccine... Tamiflu works in vitro (in Petri dish). That's a good news. Does it work in humans. - will be known later. Hopefully it will. There is no way to tell this for sure now. I agree, , -no need to panic .PEdited: 7 years ago "
Latest 20 cases have been reported with 2 new cases in Shanghai.2 suspected possible cases in Taiwan yet to be confirmed.All poultry markets in Shanghai has been closed and classrooms and farms sprayed with disinfectant.
Will the flu vaccine I had annually work against it?
I am afraid not. That one was made to protect from different strain of virus .P
"I will fly to Shanghai this week and I have to admit I am very worried. It would be great if someone could tell me something about the situation there:Are there more people than usual running around with breathing masks?Is there anything that lets one draw a conclusion on the actual situation, e.g. do state officials wear masks (I hope at least they know what is going on)?I am not accustomed to Chinese news reporting, nor can I read Chinese or now the right websites, so for me it is very hard to judge..."
Thank you for your replies!
Did they really start to catch pigeons in Shanghai?are there a lot of pigeons flying around in SH?
"If you consider the size of the population in Shanghai and the number who have contracted the virus since February, this virus is not moving quickly. My understanding is the pigeon tested positive was in the market for human consumption. The concern is wild birds carrying the disease and they were catching pigeons in Peoples Square. A suggestion raised by the media is that the test used to detect the virus is faulty because even patients who have died have shown a ""weak"" positive.#Alex - you have obviously been keeping up-to-date on the internet and can continue to do so when you arrive in Shanghai."
"I don't think there is any reason to cancel a trip to Shanghai at this time. As I mentioned before, I live here and have three small children, 5, 5 and 1. I am keeping close tabs on this issue and would not hesitate to leave to protect my children if I thought there was any reason to do so. While this *may* turn into something, at the moment it is a small number of cases out of 22 million.... Life is going on normally in China. A few are wearing masks, but those cute little cloth masks due nothing anyway...."
"I asked my doctor for a prescription for Tamiflu as a precaution. It will be handy for any influenza virus, I would just urge everyone to be influenced by what health professionals recommend rather than social media. There are plenty of facts available on the internet and on the news. There's absolutely no reason to panic."
Totally agree with #53. Get a hand sanitizer for 15 RMB from Watsons and use it every time you been on the bus/metro/restaurant and that's it. http://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/
"No, I am not. But every time, it was gone soon. Every time, when the summer was coming, it was gone. So, I think this time should be the same. So, I said it will be gone soon."
would you recommend a pregnant women to to Shanghai at this stage?
It's not a good idea to seek medical related opinion on a travel forum.

"Dear all,I am going to visit beijing this May. With my wife and a daughter of 2 years old.Hopefully all of you could update latest news throught this travel website.thanks."
"Well, latest update: Not even 80 confirmed cases on 1,3 billion (!) people. That is some 0,000006% of the population infected or so. More likely to get hurt on your way to and from China (accident, plane crash, heart attack) than catching it here. Even your chances of winning the lottery are higher than catching the flu for time being. Major concern would more be safety precautions of the government (quarantine measures, closing of places etc.) the more cases are found."
"Hardly anyone is wearing the mask,i don't see more than a dozen cases wear mask even when I travel through the subway zig zagging here and there.I have seen many foreigners with children here on holidays enjoying themselves without one too.Don't worry very strict precautions and early measures had been taken and even the WHO has confirmed that there is no human to human transmissions as yet.Still it would be better if you are careful and take proper hygiene.We Chinese always believe every 10 years or so when we change a new chairman there is always a new tragedy but as always hopefully it will pass by soon."
"I'm really concerned;apparently on april 17-they are bringing in international flu experts from the USA,EU,UN & Hong kong because of the ever widening outbreak."
"The US news report says there are wide spread China tour cancellation for the Los Angeles travel agencies, many travel agents specialized in China tours reported they had zero business for several weeks, not as bad as SARS, but worst since then.Benny, You are in the tour business, has there been any signs of cancellation or reduced visitors?"
"This virus apparently is bizzare and quite new to us as well as to foreign countries,many experts would definitely eager to be part of the team and to develop a new vaccine.China definitely needs experts from overseas in this aspect even though the virus has been well contained.It is not alarming in getting foreign expertise where the medical standard might be much higher for the sake of the people."
"From what I hear, the number of people infected is much higher. It is just that many choose to not go to the hospital and therefore there are a lot of unreported cases.My partner and I are supposed to relocate to Shanghai in less than a month for work. This whole bird flu virus does have us somewhat worried. But, employees who are already in Shanghai report business as usual and no panic on the streets. When we went to get our vaccination shots, the nurse said to just keep away from the markets, zoos and areas with lots of pigeons.Edited: 7 years ago "
"""But, employees who are already in Shanghai report business as usual and no panic on the streets.""What do you expect? Chaos and anarchy because 100 (if you say the number is much higher) infected on 20 million inhabitants? I wonder why no one cancels their trips to China because of the nearly 1 million TB cases... bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-19/china-discover…While we still don't know if the flu virus is transmitted from human to human we are 100% sure that TB is."
"Laowai88,i assume that many things that happen in China always look much worse and alarming to many foreigners,till today many would paint a pessimistic view on the changes here even though we had enjoyed a lot of progress and stability and actually we are indeed quite happy with minimum occurrence of violence and chaos.At least in Shanghai and in my hometown Shantou,we can go out late hours and be sure to be back safely."
you guys would both know that the tv had about 4 hrs of coverage of the bird flu on Monday night.that's a serious amount of air time...
Since I'm staying in hotels and eating out-you have to make sure it is well-cooked-another worry. As a naturopath said it is a good time to be a vegetarian!!!
"The fact that there may be lots of unreported cases is a good thing, no? It means that people aren't dropping dead left and right even if they do get this. Look, between 3,000 and 49,000 people died this year alone from regular flu in the United States!! (According to the CDC as reported in this article : …nbcnews.com/_news/… Why isn't there widespread panic in the US? Because it's old news. Only new news is interesting."
"Based on your logic and mathematics, SARS was no big deal either, afterall, not that many people died from SARS. People said the exact same thing as you did in the early stage of SARS. Nobody know the future, we all hope and think this bird flu will go away quietly as all previous bird flu did, this is not the first bird flu. But don't stick your neck out too far. It is only reasonable for foreign visitors to be concerned and ask about it, you'd do the same if you are going to a country with widely reported health issue, please do not be offensive.There are new cases added daily and spreading to new cities, you are just as concerned and reading the news as everyone else. Foreign travelers and you are the same.Edited: 7 years ago "
"Let us be reasonable,level headed and moderate,realistic.the birds and chicks are getting smarter or is it that they are victims too.Quick action by the government to contain it is commendable too.i dont know how the foreigner feel scared or pessimistic or paranoid?but im sure they have real reasons to be concerned,On the local front here as a local life goes on as normal and as i said i just have beijing duck and beggar chicken 2 days back,."
"just like any outbreak it would be advisable to drink plenty of water,wash hands frequently wear mask even though that fashion has not pick up yet,get early treatment for even if you think its simple flu and avoid overcrowded places which is almost none here and maybe a flu jab ,even though this strain is somwhat different.But i doubt it is really necesarry to cancel any trips here."
"Macbcmini,Of course you should be concerned. I have three small children and am watching this very closely. I won't hesitate to get out of dodge if things get bad. But people often make silly decisions based on media hype. Another example : 45,000 people are killed on the roads EVERY YEAR in the USA. But one plane crash makes the news for days on end even though that kills a much smaller number. Why is that? It's because the plane crash is newsworthy but the car crashes aren't.10 people have died in Shanghai since this was first reported. I would be willing to bet there are at least 5 contagious diseases that have had more fatalities in Shanghai during the same period, including non-bird flu. My point is that people are concerned about bird flu because it is being reported, even though other risks are probably much higher.If you come to Shanghai now, I guarantee you there is a bigger risk crossing a road than from bird flu....."
We cancelled our trip and is the best decision we made of this millenium
well said Seatrump. Like your conclusion at the end...simple and it is ture.
Well I'm back home from my 9/4 to 19/4 Shanghai trip (delayed flight) - brought with me 4 small hand-sanitizers [but hardly used -maybe in total 5x only] and my friend brought masks for the both of us [only used that during the ERA show due to the close crowds].It was simply business as usual everywhere except that our tour leader said he was under orders NOT to serve chicken/duck for all our meals [so no specialty Salty Duck etc] ! Our hotel breakfasts - the cooks were under orders to ensure that all the eggs were well-cooked so NO runny yolks (sunny side ups) etc ! Will report on trip in more appropriate threads.
"I booked a Shanghai hotel on-line for this weekend. Couldn't help but notice lots of ""specials"" -- rooms offered at reduced rates. As to eating poultry, it's silly to avoid it. Has nothing at all to do with catching avian flu. http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/qa.htmEdited: 7 years ago "
"My 2 teens and I just got back from China and 2 days in Shanghai. We went to the bird market as well. There were 7 deaths out of 21 million people. We did not eat chicken, but I heard it is not from food.All is fine."
"We are in Shanghai now - lucky us! This is a very modern city. We at no time considered cancelling, I kept up-to-date with the latest news before we left. We took a course of Tamiflu as a precaution which will help against other nasty viruses as well. We've been eating duck and chicken, scientists say that the virus will not survive in cooked food. They advise not to eat undercooked food or raw eggs. We are not wearing masks. My husband ate a runny egg on a burger when we arrived at the hotel late at night. I wouldn't but that shows how relaxed he feels because before we left home he said he would avoid poultry and he loves duck.We had a wonderful Beijing duck dish last night.The only time I felt my life was at risk was in the taxi from the airport at Changsha - there were no seat belts, compulsory at home.Edited: 7 years ago "
"CCTV13 4/18/2013""Good news"" is death of 17 is ""only 50% increase"" in the last 7 days.While confirmed cases increase over 100% to 88 in 7 days. (3 more added today)60% of confirmed cases have contacts with poultry or has been in markets where live poultry is sold.40% of confirmed cases had no such contact.Officials agree there is the unconfirmed ""possibility"" of human to human transmission, as they are 5 cases in 2 families. So, as the locals here said, no big deal, no problem, nothing to worry about."
"Always believe that China with changing president each time there is a calamity and now with the addition of Sichuan earth quake.Always a natural calamity difficult to avoid.,when the H7N9 virus is still simmering.Hopefull I can go there to relief soon just like last time."
This is some scary stuff and China is just covering it up. I saw this at the forum www.avianflutalk.com. they seem to know what's up.
"You saw it on the internet - must be true.... I just spent three hours running in the countryside on Changxing Island. Everyone out there keeps birds - saw a dealer with baby chickens on his bike selling to the locals. These are the ones getting sick. They ignore the precautions, get pecked by a chicken when collecting eggs, presto bird flu.... Anyway, keep cancelling your trips.... There's too many people here already...."
Its always difficult to tell the true picture and how the ground level feel through a high powered telescope thousnads of miles away unless you are here personally.
"Hi Marj, H How's Shanghai? is it safe to go there in these days?we plan to go to Beijing & Shanghai on July.please give us some advice.thank you so much"
If you noticed there was a post that mentioned not cancelling the trip but on the other hand they took tamiflu so it's obvious there is worry & of course the WHO has now stated it is the most lethal virus ever
"Chances of any foreign visitors catching the virus is infinitely small. If it gets big, it will take many months, still very early stage and there is a big chance this thing will just quietly go away as all previous bird flus did. As of today 4/24, there are 108 confirmed cases, 23 death, 20 more cases in 6 days, 23% increase, slower than the 50% jump week before. Experts agree it is spreading from human to human in limited cases, as there is no explaination for those 40% confirmed cases who had no close contact with poultry. Risk tolerance for a young Chinese man is not the same for a foreign person with children, family or employees who depend on him or her, 1 in a million chance means very different things to each person. Visitors have to make their own decisions. There is no government cover up, all TV news and Internet sites report daily updates, the government is completely open, more so the TA members try to cover it up, I suspect some may have economic motives. It was exactly 10 years ago yesterday WHO issued SARS travel warnings to China, young Chinese have no memory of SARS, they were too young. SARS was really scary, this N7H9 is nowhere close to it."
"Just left Shanghai, unless you are slappin' skin with the chicken sellers ( or the birds) you will be OK so far no human to human cases recorded. Bew ready to be impressed with Shanghai."
"For those sceptics just come Shanghai and have a first hand look into the situation here whether we are living in fear ,despair or worried..For those fearful and cowards just stay at home and don't come at all.Even the Australian PM was here recently and dignitaries fly in and out daily.If the situation is bad we will be the first to ask visitors not to come as Shanghai is already brimming with tourists trying to get a good shot at the bund."
"We are now in Xidi, Anhui, there were early cases in this provence. Chickens are still to be seen in the villages but I wouldn't be silly enough to get close to them. We were served duck at the Hyatt's restaurant in Shanghai but other places we've been have taken all poultry off the menu. I don't know if this is because people are not ordering it or they are taking precautions because authorities are still saying poultry is safe to eat.We would still have come to China without Tamiflu but I considered it was advisable particularly since I caught an unpleasant virus last trip. I think you need to have a proper perspective about this, I Am quite serious when I say you take more risk with a Chinese taxi. Many don't have seat belts,in the back for passengers, it seems only front seat belts are compulsory? In Australia they are necessary by law and you would not consider driving without them. Also will you cancel your trip because of earthquakes? They are not uncommon to China and back in 1989 we had one in Newcastle Australia. What about terrorist attacks, will you cancel all travel,to the US? I could go on but you see my point. There is always a risk in travel.Getting back to Shanghai I wish we had more time to spend there - it's a great city. People are going about there normal lives."
"@pattysue, I assured you as much as I possibly could before we left that we were not concerned. @raymondh, By the time July comes you will certainly have a clear picture about the situation."
"For the critics who had not set foot here try not to be smart.Its better to get the true picture from us the locals here and those expats staying here whether or not there is a coverup.The line dancers are still out at Nanjing road every night and the taichi each morning and my dad is still playing chess with his buddy at Fuxing park every morning.There is no sense of panic or gloom.However as this virus is adamant and mysterious it would be logical to take necessary precautions.Hopefully it would not mutate or transmit between humans then it would be Real danger and a pandemic might occur.Just last week I was at Xindalu,the Beijing duck is still hot favourite ,my beggar's chicken tasted wonderful and many customers still eat as normal .No mention about avoiding poultry and my western guests on the next table are also taking duck.I would say these westerners are full of guts.If there is an absolute necessity im sure the government will banned restaurants from serving poultry. they would not gamble with the lives of the populace.So I say that you can come to enjoy Shanghai."
"As a matter of fact,things seem fine in Shanghai because they have closed a lot of the animal markets so not concerned with shanghai. Nor am I concerned about HK-hopefully what they did in shanghai will be done in other places"
