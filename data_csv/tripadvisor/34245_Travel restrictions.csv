"Does anyone help with the rules for traveling to Slovenia please.We are due to travel 16th of Aug and are trying to work out the liklihood of it happening. Uk is currently on the red list so we couldn't come, but what I don't understand is1) what moves a country to Amber or Green.2) When they review this, is it weekly or monthly etc3) what does it mean to be on Amber, some things seem to say that it's then okay to come if you have prebooked accommodation (no quarantine) others say that it still needs quarantine.The chances of the uk moving to green in 6 weeks seems low but moving to Amber I would assume is possible"
"Amber means quarantine for non-residents of Slovenia, red means quarantine for everybody entering from that country. The only case where you are able to avoid quarantine with prebooked accommodation is when your country goes from green to amber after you have booked your trip as far as I understand.14-day averages are consulted when making these decisions, the threshold between green and amber is said to be at 10 new daily cases per 100,000 people. The threshold between amber and red is murkier but in the end it’s a political decision.Edited: 5:34 am, July 04, 2020 "
"Romania is currently on Slovenia's orange list and has more biweekly daily cases than the UK does. UK currently has 20.9 per 100,000 new daily cases whereas Romania has 23.6 per 100,000 new daily cases. Thus it is possible the UK will be taken off the red list relatively soon, though I agree with @rtt0921 this will likely be a political decision rather than a medical one. This is Slovenia's governmental website:https:/…Check regularly to see if the UK has been taken off the red list. If you booked accommodation in Slovenia before Europe went into lockdown and have proof, then as long as the UK is on the orange list you can enter as a tourist with a negative COVID-19 test less than 36 hours beforehand. It is very unlikely the UK will be on the green list so here's to hoping it makes it off the red."
"Fantastic thanks both, yes we booked back in January so well before this all happened. I hadn't realised that this allows tourists from Amber countries in without a quarantine period. I would hope uk will be moved to Amber as its improved exponentially here"
"I've consulted the Police website and there is an additional detail regarding the prebooked accommodation exception that I have missed earlier, specifically: ""Upon entry to Slovenia, the person invoking this exception must submit a negative test for presence of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), which may not be older than 36 hours and must be made in an EU or Schengen area member country or at an organisation or entity authorised by the National Institute of Public Health of the Republic of Slovenia (NIJZ).""source: https://www.policija.si/eng/newsroom/news-ar…"
The NHS are carrying out free drive in and walk in tests that give COVID-19 results within one day on average so if the UK is moved off the red list you can get this 3 days in advance of your flight to make sure you get your test results back in time.
"Unfortunately the 36 hour bit is the challenge, is that 36 hours from receiving the negative result or 36 hours from having taken the test"
"I read where I can go to Croatia from the US. I will be spending over 14 days in Croatia before traveling to Slovenia. I wonder if that would satisfy any quarantine for entering Slovenia. I think my biggest problem may be dealing with bureaucrats who may not know or misinterpret the rules, which I can understand. I do not leave from the US until mid September so hopefully things will be better by then. Everyone I talk to is trying to talk me out of going, I admit I am starting to get a little discouraged."
"It is always up to the officials to interpret the rules. By following the rules here in Slovenia, one can see how quickly they change, both as rules and as interpretations of those rules. What the actual situation next week will be is impossible to predict, never mind September. What I can say is good luck with fighting the virus in the US as it looks it is one of the hardest hit nations, based on available data."
"We've had good news in that the UK is now on the Green list (hopefully that will remain). However since we fly to Pula and travel to Slovenia, does anyone know what that means for quarantine as Croatia is on the Amber list"
"Dave,if you show the air ticket detailing your arrival to border police you should be OK as you haven't spend any time in so called red list countries."
"Anyone got a clue why the UK government is not reciprocating Slovenia's non-quarantine of UK arrivals, especially given Slovenia's corona situation is better than some other countries whose arrivals we are allowing to enter freely?"
"Well never mind, seems like Slovenia and some of the other previously-overlooked smaller European countries will be exempt from quarantine on arrival in England starting this Tuesday: https:/…update-travel-corridors"
"Out of curiosity, how can Slovenia even enforce border control with Croatia, when there are so many entrance points across the border?"
To my knowledge the UK IS reciprocating as of yesterday. It was in Slovenian press.
Perhaps you are not aware that there is a hard border between Slovenia and Croatia. The former is in Schengen and the latter is not.
"But how Slovenia or Croatia can prevent people from moving across the ""soft"" borders with so many roads and footpaths across the border? My point is, better go through the hard border, but in reality people can still pass with no border control in place."
"of course, they can - if they want to do it illegally :DBut each and every official border pass on the road is checked and monitored by police."
"So if I'm planning a bicycle trip, I have to pass only through an official entrance? Where can I see a list/map of there entrances? Thanks"
The info that you need would be here:https:/…border-crossings
Thanks!
