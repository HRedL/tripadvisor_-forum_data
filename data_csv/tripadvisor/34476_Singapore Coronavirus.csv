I will be visiting Singapore in April 1st week with my mom and dadI have heard that the situation in Singapore right now is critical Should I visit Singapore in April? Will the situation get under control?
"Hi Arun, if you’re on your own and you can up the hygiene go for it. Nothing is closed. Game on. If with kids, that’s another story. As for it being critical it’s not. The best indicator is DORSCON. It’s Orange. Critical would be red. It’s put out by the authorities who have all the facts. It is not critical here.https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/detai…Edited: 11:18 am, February 10, 2020 "
"And I would add that the situation is under control with Singapore being praised for its handling by health experts.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020…Thus article shows a positive controlled response from many businesses https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020…Edited: 11:26 am, February 10, 2020 "
Do you think the virus spread will get under control in April?? What’s the percentage of getting better in April?
"Arun, absolutely no one can tell you that. You will just have to wait and see.At the moment is under control, furthermore it seems likely that the disease severity is not far from seasonal flu. My guess (and it is a guess) is that the DORSCON will be lowered by april.But, then again, no one can truthfully answer your question correctly."
"Hi Arun, I don’t know. I suggest you keep an eye on the links below: 1. Case data https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/2. DORSCON RATING FOR SINGAPOREhttps://www.moh.gov.sg/2019-ncov-wuhanThe DORSCON is the key metric. Set by Government, under very specific criteria being met. Cannot be argued against. Whatever you decide, good luck and stay safe"
"Hi ArunI get that you’re panicked. IF,  45 cases today and it continues growing at say 5 cases a day in 30 days, nearly 200 cases in Singapore. IF 45 cases, 45 recoveries, no further growth, happy days!These are 2 huge IF’s. Neither of which may come to pass.I suggest instead of trying to quantify your risk, review it qualitatively - would you be happier going to a non infected destination instead ?"
"By April, who knows. Sadly I've sent my crystal ball back to the suppliers because it doesn't work, I arrived in Singapore and the virus hit the headlines days later.We are only travellers not medical experts.You need to take into account your parents' age and health.Read about the virus, use Google and only follow leads to responsible known sites. Then you'll know as much as us.Just to clarify Bill's comments, there are 45 cases in total to date, not 45 new cases in one day :) Of these, about 5 were on the evacuation flight from Wuhan so they have been in quarantine.Edited: 7:30 pm, February 10, 2020 "
"It is not critical. For the situation to be critical the warning would need to be raised to red. It is currently orange meaning “severe and can spread person to person but is being contained”. For it to be red there would need to be a number of deaths and thankfully, touch wood, there have been 0 fatalities in Singapore so far. People here are going about their day lives. The only notable changes are more people in masks, temperature checks from time to time and notices to remind you to wash hands thoroughly. The government and health system here are TOP notch and I have ever faith they are far better at controlling the situation than in any other country.If you’re coming in April that is a really Long time away and the situation could be completely different by then. None of us can know. If you cancel now you will likely lose all your money as it’s not against FCO to travel so insurers won’t cover. If you cancel and lose the money and then come April everything is back to normal you will be annoyed no? Best to wait and not worry about what you can’t know or change."
"Thank you kindly HeatSeeker, I do hope you’re having an exciting and active day exploring in Singapore ! Do update your adventures in other thread!Edited: 10:50 pm, February 10, 2020 "
