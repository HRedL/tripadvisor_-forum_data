I was warned on another forum of terrorist activities limiting locker availability in some places in Europe and am wondering how Rome is doing in this sense? Are the train station and airport still viable options? What about other Italian cities (Assisi? Florence? Maybe Bologna? Venice?) Are independent bag drop companies better? Are there some cities it's generally better to avoid that others?
"There haven't been ""lockers"" for eons -As far back as I can remember (about 20 years), it has been left luggage facilities where you leave your bags (with people checking and storing them in the facility) in train stations, etc - I have left bags in Roma Termini, Milano Centrale and Napoli Centrale - and, its perfectly fine.Not sure how many US cities stations, etc have lockers either given what someone could put in one - I know we don't have them here in NYC and I would doubt any responsible city would have them anymore - but, I don't know.Some sites in Italy are limiting bag size since the terrorist attack in Paris at the beginning of the year - the Colosseum for one now has security lines and is looking through bags and new restrictions on the size of bag one can take in (important to know this because that site does NOT have a place for you to check your bags if you take something larger than allowed) - I think anyone at this point knows, a terrorist event can (and has) happened anywhere - in unexpected places - there is no way to know or predict where to avoid in Europe (or most anywhere else) - If people on a travel could predict where NOT to go in Europe, I think it would be more than a miracle. Do what makes you comfortable."
And of course you're still much more likely to be hit by lightning or eaten by a shark than killed by terrorists. Don't worry about it.
<<you're still much more likely to be hit by lightning or eaten by a shark>>Now MichaelSeattle2012 has me worried about being eaten by a shark. I know how to protect myself from lightning but what does one do in Rome to protect against sharks? I haven't seen a single bit of advice on TA...
"@Toronto: don't go swimming in any fountains, Bernini was known for his jokes."
"Toronto, I've read numerous articles and have seen many statistics on shark attacks in Rome. I'm surprised you haven't seen them as it's a growing epidemic. As Tabata says, stay out of the fountains......;-)donna"
"Ah... I knew we were supposed to stay out of the fountains, now I know why!"
Please- All of us Aussies go to Rome to avoid the sharks. Now every fountain will have to be avoided. Oh well will just have to do things in Rome that keep us inside. Although this could create employment for sun-bronzed aussies to guard the fountains.This topic has put a smile on my face all day while I was doing a very boring task. RegardsJann
"The lack of lockers in Italian train staions dates from the domestic terrorism of the 1970s/80s, e.g. the Bologna Station bomb in 1980 which killed 85 people.It has nothing to do with more recent terrorism.Major stations have staffed left luggage offices, where luggage can be inspected before deposit."
"Lol, sorry guys, had to ask after getting warned! I bet the people warning me were just trying to do their best to help so thanks for all the info. I'll be avoiding those fountains because they just dont sound safe right now. When the shark alert warning color hits green again I guess I'll be safe to take selfies near the fountains. But really thanks again ad this has been funny as hell!"
Stewie- Yes it has been funny. Hope you have a great time.RegardsJann
"The lack of lockers and left luggage places in NY also has to do with domestic terrorism in the 1970s -- in particular, the FALN (Puerto Rican nationalist group) that was responsible for bomb at LGA that killed several.Am always surprised by (though grateful for) the continuing presence of lockers and left lugage places in the UK, as they had similar problems with the IRA and now face threats from other sources of terrorism."
