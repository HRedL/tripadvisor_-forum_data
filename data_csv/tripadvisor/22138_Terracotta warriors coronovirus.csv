Hi Are the terracotta warriors (mausoleum of first quin emperor) definitely closed today? Our hotel said they were because of coronovirus but google suggests they are not. Does anyone know for sure?Thanks Charlotte
Seems to me your hotel would be in a better position to know that compared to google.
"If you do a Google search in Chinese on: Terracotta Warrior Museum coronavirus ( 兵马俑博物馆冠状病毒 ), you'll find several news articles that state it is closed from the 24th. Here is one: www.chinanews.com/gn/2020/01-24/9068659.shtmlWhich Google Translate says ""China News Service, Xi'an, January 23 (Reporter Tian Jin) The Qin Shi Emperor's Mausoleum announced on the evening of the 23rd that according to the needs of the new coronavirus-infected pneumonia epidemic prevention and control work, in order to avoid cross-infection caused by people gathering, the Qin Shi Emperor's Mausoleum It was decided that the museum will be closed from January 24, 2020, and the opening hours will be announced separately."""
The hotel is more reliable source of information
"Hey, usually I’d agree but hotel told me no taxis running but they are so in this situation no!"
"""Hey, usually I’d agree but hotel told me no taxis running but they are so in this situation no!"" - trans-provincial and trans-municipal buses and taxis have been suspended in Xi'an so it is possible that is what they were talking about."
It is closed due to the coronavirus。
"Hi can anyone post here in case of any upadate? I tried to google but nothing came out. I have a trip scheduled on April, so if it's still close, it's a bit pointless for me to continue the trip."
Terracotta army museum is still closed due to the coronavirus for today（March 2).xi'an David
it seems that the museum has reopened (under special conditions) since Wednesday March 25:https:/…WS5e7ab2afa310128217281c1d.html
