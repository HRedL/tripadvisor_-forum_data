I have a hotel booking in Liverpool for the 8th of April I have emailed the hotel and they have stated they are open still and looking forward to seeing us . What is the situation in Liverpool ? Are the tourist attractions still open and the shops unable to decide what to do now . I booked it in credit card but not sure if they will refund if hotel still open. Plus I did a no cancellation booking
"Have you not seen the government statements from yesterday? Most places will be closed.https://www.cavernclub.com/""The Cavern's venues and tours to close from March 18th until April 3rd amidst the worldwide COVID-19 battle.""I suspect those closures willbe extended into May.No pubs, clubs or restaurants will be open including the ones in your hotel. All the museums in Liverpool are closed https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/Stay at home and if the hotel won't refund your booking then you will just have to take the hit. Honestly it is just not worth travelling anywhere at the moment for tourism. Stay at home, you will likely just have a miserable time in Liverpool anyway.Your credit card company will not refund you.Edited: 5:15 am, March 21, 2020 "
"Read and understand the implications of the news (especially from yesterday) - and stay at home. I am keeping this reply as polite as I can, but really the last three words of the previous sentence should be in capitals."
"sure if you have booked the non refundable one,you wont get a refund …. still better to stay home at this scary time"
still if hotel closed down they will have to refund you ...So don't cancel let hotel to inform you if they will be open or not
"Post #4 has it I think. Cancel mentally, reconcile yourself to not going and wait and see if the hotel cancel or are forced to close in which case you’ll get your money. I don’t think you will, write off the money, anything you get back is a bonus."
"if you have booked on a NO cancellation booking, leave the cancellation until the last minute, at least that way things may have changed and you might get your money back via the hotel cancellation.otherwise as others have said stay at home and take the hit..One final point, do you have travel insurance, some policies cover UK travel as well"
"This is why I always book through booking.com and choose hotels that have ""free cancellation"".Yes, it can sometimes, but not always, be more expensive than not selecting ""free cancellation"" or even booking direct through the hotel; but the price difference is minimal. I was supposed to be going to Manchester on 3rd April to see a concert and I had a hotel booked so that I didn't have to worry about getting the last train back to Liverpool (which is always a nightmare, especially on a Friday night!) and so that I could then have a little pub crawl around Manchester on the Saturday and watch the Grand National somewhere.Anyway, the concert was cancelled but I thought about still going to Manchester for a few pints.Then the situation worsened and I actually cancelled my hotel before the pub closure announcement was even made. I had ""free cancellation"", no questions asked.I have another trip planned to Glasgow, Rotterdam and Antwerp in June (yes, strange combination of places to visit, but all for a very good reason! ;-) ) and again, I have booked the hotels on booking.com using the ""free cancellation"" option. Fingers crossed i won't have to cancel, but if I do, well you know the story! Sorry if this sounds like a lecture, but it's the same one I give to friends and family, who still ignore me and think it's better to book direct with a hotel to literally save a couple of quid but, with no ""free cancellation"" policy! Come back to Liverpool in the Summer when the weather will be a bit better and the pubs will be open. ;-)"
Thanks everyone for your reply . Yes you are all right so no point going if everything is closed . Worse thing is I work for emergency services so I’m going to be exposed daily anyway . I hope everyone who can stay in is doing so . Best of luck to everyone
"right you are ,still at this moment it will be wise for all not to travel and stay local and if possible stay at home .. to give time to medics to control this epidemic"
"Remind the hotel of the government advice...and then gently say you will be only to happy to report them to as many government departments , and the local council"
"Some hotels have different policy about non-refundable bookings according to covid-19 situation. Hilton gives refund even for non-refundable bookings, Accor - you can change dates until end of this year etc."
"To be fair to the hotel, circumstances have changed dramatically even since the OP posted and the hotel may well have changed its cancellation policy by now, or even decided to close."
The latest update from the government means that hotels have to close for all commercial use apart from permanent residents and/or key workers. This is confirmed here:https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/f…
"We have been in the same situation with non cancellable hotels one in Scarborough and one in Copenhagen.. Scarborough has allowed us to move the date, the Copenhagen one sent us an email yesterday to say they are looking forward to seeing us on 3rd April, even though their borders have been closed for over a week! We are just waiting to see if they finally close and offer a refund.Stay safe and stay home for now. Liverpool will welcome you once this is all over."
"Naturally we have our travel heads on for the very best deal. But we’re screwed- we lost the last day of our much needed vacation, which was nothing compared to so many others. Sadly this is not about fun but about safety and that means fun in the future. With regrets and love xxxx"
"That's great news. Please do come back on here closer to the time if you need any help, tips and advice for your visit."
"It would be a shame, but it’s not worth travelling even if it means losing you’re money. I think most hotels will be reasonable at refunding. If not, feel free to call them out on trip advisor!"
