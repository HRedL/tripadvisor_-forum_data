"We were set to come to MB March 22nd-29th, and wondering if things are still open. We were driving, and packing a cooler, so no issues with coming in contact with others on the way, except stopping for gas (which can all be done at the pump)."
Be aware that there is no dining-in at restaurants - take out or drive through only. No bars or clubs. Spot shortages of some items at supermarkets.
Beaches are open.. All bars and restaurants are closed with the exception of takeout and delivery. Essentially all indoor attractions are closed.
The beaches are open and a lot of very nice restaurants have delicious carryout items from their normal menu. Yesterday we had burgers and fries from Hamburger Joe's that were quite good and reasonably priced. Tonight we got a carryout from Joe's Bar and Grill. We had one order of filet mignon and one order of pork chops (both with potatoes and salad) and they were fantastic! We were staying at Ocean Creek Resort across from Barefoot Landing and have been easily able to keep a decent amount of distance between us and others. We've had a great time!

"Fred, posting your email here invites spam or worse. The way to get an answer on TA is to check for responses on the topic you posted in."
"Fred, I agree with the other post, don’t post your email address! Also, just because you feel healthy doesn’t mean you or your friend doesn’t have the virus. That’s why everyone is practicing social distancing. You can’t really practice social distancing if you’re staying in a condo with someone. Please, just stay home until this is under control so we can all get back to normal as soon as possible!!"
"Fred, as others have said, do not put your email address out there in public!And...I suggest checking with your ""healthy"" friend on this one. Sounds like he is there in MB now? Ask him about restrictions. And 3rd of all....common sense would tell me not to go."
"Although all of you are healthy it does not mean you are not carriers. You can transmit without knowing. For the time being, don’t travel if it is not necessary. You may make a difference to someone or yourselves. This will pass and you and your friends will have plenty of time to enjoy time together. Stay safe"
"Prinze, nobody knows what will be happening in two months. The new cases are spiking and the Governor still refuses to implement statewide restrictions. Stay tuned."
Beaches and pools have been open for quite some time.
"WE are going end of July...and I can't seem to find any info about the CURRENT state of things. I just read that masks are required. Is that EVERYWHERE, or just when encountering businesses, or going indoors?"
"We are also coming end of July, staying at Dunes Village, and trying to watch what is happening daily."
"Myrtle Beach just started requiring masks indoors and any public place where social distancing is not practical. It is a local requirement. Other places may be doing similar things. It is not blanket statewide.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g54359…Edited: 11:21 am, June 26, 2020 "
"Gotcha. We are staying in Myrtle Beach. Texas has the same thing. In fact, I think we opened up WAY too soon."
Are restaurants at 50%?
Some pools are closed. Call first to find out. You still have the ocean though of course.
"I posted this in another thread but I'll re-post it here. Two different summers we visited the two state parks in the area. First was Huntington Beach SP. We hit the beach for just a short while at the main parking lot area near the castle and store/visitors center. The lady at the castle said the road that heads north dead-ends at another smaller parking lot (bath facility there as well). She said that the entire beach area between these parking areas is open. This is about one mile of beach, but it is desolate the further away from the parking lots people get. Also, there won't be any lifeguards in this area for sure. The next year we visited Myrtle Beach SP. They only had one main area that I recall. Both parks had people, but weren't busy. There was more than enough room to spread out. Might be an option for those willing to drive, pay the entry fee, and have a nice beach without so many people nearby. I've found the same to be true in two of the Florida state park beaches I've visited in the past."
