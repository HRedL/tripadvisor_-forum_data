"Hello,I'm currently near Khabarovsk and I'm wondering if I can go to Sakhalin and Kamchatka. I tried to go to Sakhalin from Vanino by ferry about two weeks ago but it required a special permit and COVID-19 test due to the current pandemic, I got the COVID-19 test but didn't know how to get the permit so I decided to wait.I'm trying to find information for the travel situation as it stands today.Thanks!"
