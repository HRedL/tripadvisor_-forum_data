A person with no travel history has been diagnosed with Covid-19. A lock down is now in effect.https:/…It has also been reported that a long time Cayman resident died of the virus after traveling to Honduras.
"Thank you, Sue, for the important update. As visitors, we are all concerned about the well being of Cayman and her residents."
The press conference is presently ongoing. Curfew starts at 7 but no lock down yet. The patient in Honduras had the dead certificate amended to suspected Covid. It is not clear at this time if he was ever tested. He had ongoing health issues as well as a condition he was not aware of. There are still many many questions.
This is a crazy germ....obviously a huge issue in places like NYC where there is a dense population with people using pubic transportation more than areas with more space. But everyone needs to be vigilant and practice measures to avoid close contact and minimize potential spread to others.
We are going into lockdown starting tonight for 48 hours.
48hrs? What is that going to do?B.
"Given the current info on the spread of this virus, cannot understand how a 48 hour total lockdown will be effective."
I think the 48 hours is a wake up call for the idiots who didn’t follow the stay at home guidelines. It is prevent the spring break behavior.
Hope it works. A bunch of stupid people out there making it worse for all of us.B.
Hopefully a 48hr “taste” of social distancing will help people see “it ain’t so bad” and they’ll just stick with it.
"AH....that makes sense Retrip! By choice I have been home for the last 6 days simply to practice whatever I can to NOT become part of the problem. Eventually will need to get to the grocery store for salad items and fresh vegetables. No lockdown here, but strict measures which most people are following. The latest big concern is the people from NYC either coming to their summer homes, renting places in R.I., driving to stay with family or friends. It was just announced that The National Guard and State Police will be manning the borders, stopping cars with NY plates, taking their contact info and letting them know they are mandated to a 14 day quarantine."

"I think not going to the grocery store from now until May is not possible for the vast majority. We are definitely cutting back on being anywhere with others, exorcising more than the normal precautions, yet not panicking and doing our best during this temporary crisis. As people ages of 70+ and one of us with other health issues, the other an essential worker we are fully aware and taking precautions, but also not going to throw in the towel by completely isolating 24/7 ad finitum, no contact with the world beyond the confines of our home, and depending on outside sources for all of our needs.My outstanding surgical oncologist totally agrees with what we are doing!Edited: 7:51 pm, March 26, 2020 "
"<< “ exorcising more than the normal...” >>Typo, Freudian slip, or is Linda Blair staying with you?:-)"
Yes typo!
"""Citation:""Thank you for being part of a very small and underappreciated minority.""Yes typo!""Exorcising sounds at least as effective as a lot of other things being suggested on the interwebs."
"Hehehe...admit this is not easy! Trying to maintain some sense of humor. Have been sticking to the recommendations and as of today many of those have become mandates thanks to the numbers of people who simply have been doing whatever they please. So for those of us who have been good, obedient citizens for the past 2 weeks get to stretch it out with even more restrictions for at least another 2 weeks. Parks and beaches here remain open, but with any nice day there are large groups gathering at those places so fully expect they will be closed fairly soon."
"LTDreams loves to fear monger. While what he says has a scientific base he way over exaggerates the risks. There is no doubt that this virus is dangerous and we all need to be careful and socially distance ourselves. We also need to be realistic.Here is a nice article by Johns Hopkins that explains things in more realistic every day terms like going to the grocery store. A couple of key take aways if you don't want to read it. ""What's getting a lot of press and is presented out of context is that the virus can last on plastic for 72 hours—which sounds really scary. But what's more important is the amount of the virus that remains. It's less than 0.1% of the starting virus material. Infection is theoretically possible but unlikely at the levels remaining after a few days. People need to know this.""and""While the New England Journal of Medicine study found that the COVID virus can be detected in the air for 3 hours, in nature, respiratory droplets sink to the ground faster than the aerosols produced in this study.""Here is a link to the entire article. https:/…B."
"Appreciate this input! Our Governor has overall been very good dealing with this issue, but today she said even if you sneeze you must quarantine for 14 days. Geez, it is pollen season and I sneezed three times today but since not outdoors as much as usual these sneezes far less than usual and with no fever or other indications, although respectful, see no valid reason to quarantine. Common sense with more vigilant attention over fear mongering is a saner approach IMO."
Lovecayman. Agreed. That is fear mongering and inciting panic.. Common sense prevails If you go out in the sun and get hot it doesn't mean you have a fever.B.
"Sending good thoughts to you who seem to be facing more problems and concerns in the upcoming days and weeks! I am an older person who has weathered such things as the scare of Cold War when as a kid did air raid drills at school hunkering under desks and the mass polio clinics for the Salk vaccine, the Cuban missle crisis. Serious issues like this one, but they never rose to the level of taking over our entire daily life at every turn for every minute of every day. We learned to realize there are always matters to pay attention to and then to find a balance!Edited: 7:39 pm, March 28, 2020 "
"Here is another good article that realistically talks about getting infected from delivered packages or going grocery shopping. https:/…We 100% need to take this virus very seriously but we should look at things realistically and with logic. B.Edited: 5:13 pm, March 29, 2020 "

"Fear mongering, conspiracy theories call it what you want. You should just stop posting. I am sure that your ""previous career in chem/bio defense"" puts you at some understanding above all of us.. or not. I particularly liked your cruise ship link that was so very helpful as was the nexstrain link. Did you miss this?""The virus mutates so slowly that the virus strains are fundamentally very similar to each other,” said Charles Chiu, a professor of medicine and infectious disease at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine""B."
So anything new about traveling to Cayman or just Covid-19. Not sure that the present discussion is relative to Cayman specifically.
"Retrip - You are 100% right. FYI I did not report the poster as I thought it was ""sort of"" travel related although really bad info. I did ask him to stop posting via PMStay home. Wash your hands. That is what is needed right now. All this other stuff is just noise. B."
