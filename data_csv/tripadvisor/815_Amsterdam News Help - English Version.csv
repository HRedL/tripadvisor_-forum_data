Can anyone please recommend a good Amsterdam news website with an English version? I tried Google and couldn't find any helpful websites. Thanks

If you're looking for local Amsterdam news the parool has a (fairly limited) number of articles in English.https://www.parool.nl/english
Instal Google translate extension into your browser and it will translate from any language. Simples.
Thanks for the recommendations.

"This seems to be the latest situation in English :https:/…traveltonlIn short, if you are from the UK or the US, forget it. If you are allowed into the Netherlands at all, you will have to do 14 days quarantine. Ironic, considering that both Trump and Johnson are boasting how well their country is doing."
