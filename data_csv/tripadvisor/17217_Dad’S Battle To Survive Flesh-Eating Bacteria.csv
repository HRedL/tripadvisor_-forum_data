Dad’S Battle To Survive Flesh-Eating BacteriaBe careful when beachcombing and walking over rocky shorelines. He was infected on Egg Island next to Royal Island adjacent to Spanish Wells. tribune242.com/news/…
"Thanks for sharing. We are going to Cat Island soon, and I think we will all be keeping this in mind when we are exploring."
"That's why I posted it. Those Swiss cheese like coral rocks with water pockets are very sharp to walk across. Best to wear shoes, sneakers, or at least water shoes when considering walking over them."
"Let's put this into perspective -- with tens of thousands of people swimming and exploring, there is ONE case of this disease. It is not an epidemic! It's not the rocky shoreline that is the issue (unless you get cut on them), but the stagnant pools that can contain this dangerous bacteria."
No one said it is an epidemic. But with heavy rain in the summer months fresh water can collect in the pock-marked rocks along the shore.
Important reminder no matter where you are.Stagnant water in the heat is the issue. Usually have a couple of deaths each summer in TX from kids that contract it from swimming in ponds/lakes. It can get in through ears/nose/mouth. Be very careful of swimming in any water that doesn't get much movement.
"There is a lot of stagnant water around caves, be careful."
How about sweetings pond?? Does that get any movement?? I am not the worrying kind....justvasking if u think thats ok??
The bacteria is Vibrio vulnificus and lots of info out there about where and how it's contracted. Lives in salt and brackish warm water and those who are immunocompromised or have open wounds are most susceptible - low risk for most people. Healthy persons generally don't have problems. Some cases in Florida this year.
Having read the entire article I am very very happy to hear that he is on his way to a full recovery. I can't begin to imagine how frightening this must have been for all concerned.
"Seemed to take too long to develop to be Vibrio, or even MRSA. The story wasn't written very well to pick our the details of what type of boat he was on, where he was treated, and why he was in a coma. But ... when you're walking around on iron shore, rip rap, or on a beach where there's exposed coral, or debris washing ashore ... make sure you have alcohol hand sanitizer with you. As soon as you're skin has been abraded, or been cut, pour a bunch of it over the wound. If it bleeds some, that's even better. Pour some more on, and get back to a place where you can wash it with clean water as soon as possible. If you have a compromised immune system, or the wound looks inflamed, or you have a fever within the next day or 2, go for medical help as fast as you can."
There were more cases of this in Florida than all of the Bahamas
"That may be true, but there is a lot more very sharp, pockmarked coral rock along the beaches of the Bahamas than all of Florida."
I think it is a good idea to warn tourists not to walk on sharp coral in their bare feet. Its probably also a good idea to warn them not to eat broken glass and not to stick their fingers into electrical sockets.
"Yup, a lot of them are pretty helpless ... come to an island with 8000+ people and wonder if we have grocery stores ... the new breed of 'Eleutherian Adventurers' ... kinda sad."
Many times I have walked barefoot on top of pockmarked coral beach rock but I was always very careful about walking too fast between steps to avoid sharp edges. Not that I was afraid of bacterial infections but just did not want a laceration on my sole with all the beach walking I do each visit.Your remarks above about eating glass and electrical sockets was in very poor taste.
"hey DHany idea how many of those 8000 are Belongers and how many are ex-pats? I've always been curious how you come-from-aways ended up in eleuthera. not why, I definitely get that. it is beautiful! what are your stories on how you made the choice, where else you considered. anyone willing to share? :) Grant"
I came here to get away from people who have to be told not to eat glass or walk barefoot on sharp rocks.HOW did I get here? ... Cessna 182
HOW does a Caveman survive?They are 'Flesh-Eaters'! :0
"Not included in the 8000+ are ...1817 ex pat homeowners, and 196 ""belongers"""
"ooops, is Belonger not the right word? in turks and caicos Belonger is the word the locals use to indicate a citizen of the country. and probably more precisely it means someone who was born in the country. I figured since tci and bahamas are so close they might share expressions. like potcake for example, which they do share. note to self, dont try to build street cred any more by using local expressions :) grant"
"A 'belonger' is someone, not a citizen, maybe started out as an expat or immigrant, but has been here a long time, full time, is involved in the community, maybe married to a native, maybe has kids with a native, and has been accepted as someone who 'belongs'."
"Grant, a ""belonger"" typically refers to a residency status for people who are not citizens living in one of the British Overseas Territories -- of which Turks and Caicos is, but the Bahamas is not. The Bahamas has been independent since 1973, but are still members of the Commonwealth. (as is Canada) There used to be a belonger status in the Bahamas, and it has been recently revived as a type of permit for those born in the Bahamas, but who are not Bahamian citizens. It's a bit of a misnomer, as it is more of a residency permit than an official status. Citizens of the Bahamas are referred to as Bahamians. We tend to cringe when referred to as ""natives"", as some are wont to do! ;-)"
How does the term 'locals' fit into the picture?
very interesting all. thanks for the clarification Grant
"Thanks for the explanation Dusty.As a side note I believe TCI was part of the Bahamas at one time, and governed by Nassau."
Locals ... a term (IMO) used to describe Bahamian citizens and expats who live on the island full time
"Worst thing he could have done was to submerge any part of his body in warm stagnant seawater. I'm not sure how long he's been living in Nassau, but as a local living on a island surrounded by water there are certain guidelines he should be following; especially being a beach comber/explorer.There are always warnings about stagnant waters, but not because of the virus; but because mosquitoes breed in fresh water."
"I believe belongers, locals, Bahamians and just occasional visitors like me are mostly all good folks. I even think the cave dweller and myself would get along famously. For the most part I really enjoy most people we encounter on our travels and I do my best to respect and be nice to all. Some of our best experiences were with these labeled folks. The rest, oh well, you're missing out."
"YellowJJ, Christopher has lived in the Bahamas all his life, as has his family for several generations, so he knows perfectly well what is and what isn't ok to do. I doubt he went looking for trouble that day, and he had his wife and young children with him -- a family enjoying a day exploring. He is also a well-qualified captain, fisherman and all round great guy. Your pontifications of following ""certain guidelines"" make little sense when a man well-versed on the ways of the Bahamas can have this happen to him. The lesson here is that it could have happened to anyone!"
Too funny!Gotta meet you on one of our visits
"Tigervette,Interesting story. Thanks for sharing."
