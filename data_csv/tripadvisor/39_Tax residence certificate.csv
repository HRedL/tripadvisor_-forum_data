How can I obtain Tripadvisor's tax residence certificate for 2019 and 2020? Need this for my taxes. Thanks
I have no idea.
"You should ask on the Owners Forum, but I don't know how Tripadvisor could issue a tax residence certificate. Surely that would have to be issued by the country that you're a tax resident in?"
"This seems to have been posted in the ‘World’ forum, so at least the Op has covered all bases of where it should be posted."
Reperted as not forum related (spam)
Does this show on every Forum? I couldn't see what it has to do with Travelling with disabilities !
"Yep, showing on all forums for me."
Sasha ~Do you own a B&B or hotel or inn? Or do you own a Vacation Rental through TA's VR partners Holiday Lettings or Flipkey? The directions for what to do will be different.And how in the world did you find the World Forum to post to? :-)))
Did not know a world forum existed. Awesome. Hi all!
"It appears to be a hack of some sort, it shows up in the profile as posted in the “Root” forum and is showing up on every forum so far as I’m aware. Presumably a dig at TA’s tax residence, not that I know where that is."
Just report it as inappropriate / wrong forum
Simon will be able to tell you .
All very odd when I click Browse all World topics »I get https:/…ListForums-g1-i1-World.htmlclicked it world on the list of topics on the UK forum and got https:/…ListForums-g1-i1-World.html
"Tax residence certificate is a mechanism to prevent paying double taxes in two countries. The document is issued by tax authorities of the country of residence upon taxpayer's request. I don't know what the exact question of OP is. If it is about the certificate, it is not related to TA. But it might be he has a certificate and wants to have the double tax back that might have been charged for an international transfer."
"I hope you get an answer, I will search for an answer from my close people"
"The OP is very likely an owner of a property as post 7 has said. From what I have read in the Support Forum, a Vacation Rental owner gets income from their TA listings. TA do issue some kind of tax info record. I do not know about hotels or inns.But I'm afraid this thread will get closed due to some itchy fingers, so the OP will not be able to get the advice she needs unless she posts again."
Why is this showing up in Mazatlan forum ?
"Sasha, if this thread is deleted, use the following link to the Support Forum to ask your question. And please say what kind of property you own.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g1-i12…"
This is showing up on ALL forums. Report & ignore it.
He has hacked the site look in his profile and in his list of postings you will see the forum is not called world forum its root forum his posting is showing on every forum Ive reported him others should to
Yes this thread is showing on every forum I frequent. Mystery how the OP found 'World' forum but when you look at OP's profile the forum listed is 'Root' forum !!Angie.
World Forum!! Yeh boi
Hi all from Mexico.
Ive reported his profile others should https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/GeneralSupport…
I'm fairly impressed by this to be honest.
“ Ive reported his profile others should”—-For what reason? I’d say it’s more than likely a bug on the TA website.
Whatever is occurring. Is the doorman on a tea break?
Interesting that it is still not removed although reported?
Ive reported it so if its not a hack but a problem with TA they can fix it

This is the first time I've encountered this. I can now see this on any forum but how do you reach the root forum? It's clearly better than the world forum where nobody would see a post.SWT
"It takes a while Arthur. TA are hours behind us, literally lol."
As stated it is appearing on other forums. I just saw it on the Hua Hin Forum in Thailand as well as this Gambia forum.TA admins will need to deal with it.

Let's hope TA can soon take action and remove this thread.

"Greetings to Dingle, one of my favourite short stay destinations."
Hola Bellagio nice to see you again.
"Perhaps it is TA Colleen posting ...yes, cold and wet here today, waiting for the next blast off the Atlantic, love a good storm.Edited: 5:02 am, February 28, 2020 "
brittraveller31LWhy?Because somehow the OP has managed to get this thread to show on all TA forums.
"""if it is on multiple fora, how come it only shows 1 post on his profile ?""--It's how the forums are designed to work. If someone posted in the Dublin forum, it would show up in the Province of Leinster forum, and the Ireland forum. Also if there were forums at Europe level & the World level they would also show up there - but as there aren't forums at those levels that's why you can't see posts. That's why I believe that this thread has highlighted a bug somewhere on the website."
Wow.....over 50 replies to the forum post in less than an hour!!!Is that a record????John
Must be a glitch with the infinity drive. Xaphod Beeblebrox will be along shortly. You know .... “brain the size of a planet” ......
"And my reply on the Maldives forum is also shown on the Oludeniz, Turkey forum!!!John"
"***if it is on multiple forum, how come it only shows 1 post on his profile ?***Sasha will only show another post when he responds to this thread or makes another post somewhere."

"Sasha was posting reviews in Cyrillic until 2015, then one anodyne one in English in 2019. This is the first forum post. Smells like a hack to me. Presumably posting to the root forum is meant to be for TA only, so they disabled automatic “community” post deletion."

Interesting to note that it took 24 hours to get the first response. It must have been out in cyberspace and bounced back in.
It beats reading about the corona virus ..it will probably have as many reviews by the time I get up in the morning..

Wow its colder in Pittsburgh than Toronto....thanks for the celsius conversion :)Keep this cool worldly thread going....morning again everyone...pretty sure its warm in Buenos Aires right now :)
There is no such thing in Brazil. There is the CPF which is an individual tax ID. You can get CPF at a BR Consulate/Embassy. If you owned a business in BR you would have to have gone to make the legal registration with the Board of Trade or in the Corporate Registry Office.

"Interesting thread for a Friday morning. Hi from Ontario, Canada."
When I saw “world forum” I thought someone was playing an April Fools day joke on us. But then I realised it’s 29th February (here in Australia) which is Leap Day. So then I just had to read every post on the thread just to make sure there wasn’t a proposal of marriage hiding in the thread somewhere. There isn’t. I’m disappointed. But it was a hilarious thread. :) ;)

"Sssnakes, you're certainly going to get a gift from Spekka when we get to post #299...!"
"Snakes:It's just not the Cuba forum, the whole world can now wish you a Happy Birthday."
"It's ssnakes' birthday, but paradoxically, every post is a gift to Spekka."

Greetings from the Canada's South Coast!I finally have an opportunity to speak to the entire world and can't think of a thing to say.....
"I had that feeling this morning borracho...after a quiet bowl of cheerios and a coffee, I became a tiny part of the world...it was the strangest/coolest morning thread ever :) Canadians were sleeping so the hilarious Brits stole the show :)"
"it still puzzles me as to why this post is even on the support thread. surely when TA saw this, they would have responded and then closed it down as nobody on here would have the faintest idea as to how to get the TA tax residence cert....whatever that is"
Yes but then it became an interesting worldly thread with all kinds of good stuff in it :) Forget about the paperwork :)
"#339 - Yes - and remember - ""snitches get stitches""!That's a JOKE in case someone wants to report me :-)So glad TA opened this thread back up so the rest of the world can join in now they are awake, it is a serendipitous moment of joy in a cold dark world..."
Can I still say hello posing has been removed in the originals profile but what the heck HELLO world
Oh I'm a little late missed the world now in support :)
"I feel sorry for the OP as his inbox would have been bombarded with over 300 emails from TA saying that he has had a reply to his question.But, strangely, he hasn't been back to tell us to shut up."
"That is strange I kept reading all responses, yet poor Sasha haven't get clear answer most of people asking suggestion for what to cook or travel and left the main subject behind .... So I'll do the same Maybe that's some sort of competition beating trump tweets (joke)Good day world .. from #Malapascua one of the little islands in the Philippines ))"
"Interesting to see this thread is still active. This morning the posts were being deleted, tonight they are back. It was a fun ride. (or read, if you are just catching up!)"
"Truth is ... the dolphin population of the world originated from planet Zogg . They’re natural intelligence is far superior to the human population of this planet .

I am awake now and it is still here (although now cunningly concealed) ..... Yippee!!!
"Sonia, I agree. It is sad the World is now in support. But this thread has demonstrated that it is not on life support yet. There is still life left."
Goodnight Westiegal3.Goodnight Barbados.
"Good morning from sun and snow in St. Moritz, Engadin, Switzerland! Good to see you all and the thread is back! Have a great day and a great weekend everybody!"
Good morning Sasha and the World :) Glad to see the World still in fine forum :) Maybe Sasha will make an appearance today since he/she started this fun worldly nothing to do with tax certificates thread :)
Same to you Westigal and Barbados :) A bowl of cheerios and a pc of dark rye toasted with butter this morning...boring I know...I'll go big on Sunday :) I'm thinking salmon for dinner tonight :)
"Still rolling, will there ever be an answer?"
"Hey LuckyMe,I see they shut down your The World Wide Forum topic on the Varadero forum.So, I will repeat the suggestion I made there:Maybe TA should install a new annual Happy TA Day and open a thread like this for 24 hours once a year for everyone to play nice and spread some good humour and vibes.Of course, there will always be some who would try to ruin it and not play nicely in the sandpit of life."
Yes its shut down Teaghan but you can still read it :) I like your Happy TA Day idea...it's been interesting universal fun for sure :)
"Not closed now, it has been re-opened."
"Yes, but why?"
"Does TA know what it is doing?They keep moving it, why don’t they sort it out."

Happy Leap Day to one and all. I’m flabbergasted that some TA mod hasn’t moved this thread to the OTC forum. Guess no one’s complaining about it being inappropriate.

"I really don't see any harm at all Aldergreen...it's what forming is all about...we do need to keep it travel related and appropriate and fun of course :) Soooo any travel plans planned :) Like I mention earlier, its Cayo Guerillmo in Cuba for 7 days at an all inclusive resort...I know, it sounds a little rich but its not really :) Us Canadians like to explore the warmth of South for a week or two to help us make it through winter :) Cuba, Mexico, The Dominican, and Jamaica are popular choices for the winter escape. Pretty sure I kept it travel related :)"

"@Luckyme - I don’t have a problem at all with this thread - doesn’t mean some zealous Mod won’t come along and move it though. And, actually, it’s nice in Calgary - in the midst of a Chinook and the temps have been hovering around +10°C"
+10! Lucky you :) Yes you may ask Rescue Team...you may save me someday :) I'm seeing this thread on the Cuba TripAdvisor Support forum.
Even curiouser Rescue.Appearing on evey forum world wide but aparantly the one thread?I wonder how that was done? And not only the World Forum List but the title of that list is Beyone Destination Forums. Someone at TA tech has pressed the wrong button!
What's a Cuba TripAdvisor Support forum? Can someone post a link? I've never heard of anything but the general Support forum.
"Your on it now Ariel :) If you click on ""All"" beside browse forums at the bottom of page you'll see it. You can get there from any forum not just Cuba. I hope that helps :)"
This whole thing is odd. I thought it was strange that I was seeing posts from members I had never run across before. Now I realize why.RT - I’m on the Support Forum. Can you imagine what will happen if all threads go world -wide!
"Nor do I, Ariel. I had a quick look at the Cuba forum and didn’t see this thread there. Curiouser and curiouser."
I don't get it...I'm just a guy with a keyboard :)

@Teaghan - you’re being extremely diplomatic when it comes to describing the OTC forum! There’s some wild goings on over there.
Aldergreen:LOLOne of the regulars of the OTC forum conceded in a post today that *some consider us the Land of Misfit Toys*.
"I have to admit that the OTC forum is bizarre to say the least! Some of the threads om there have to be seen to be believed! I go over once in a while to have a look....and give up after a few seconds.Edited: 3:36 am, March 01, 2020 "
It's strange indeed...I was wondering where all my deleted post go :)
"Hello,you are all still here then----------------but where is here now please. I find you through my posts on my Profile, but I have no idea where I am !!! A beach day in Barbados today ! Lovely hot weather and calm seas for jet ski riding. Nowhere quite like it :-)) Please, what is the OTC Forum and where may I find it ? Is this it?  Have a good night wherever you are in the World x"
"Ah the OTC takes some understanding - though the clue is in the name.A random thread starts say on what you had for dinner and can change subject thoughout the thread, off topic. You can't edit and you can't delete so be careful what you say. Predictive text can be interesing.There are word games galore, some require intelligence and others, well anyone can post.You need a sense of humour and not take yourself too seriously. Also be tollerentish of other nations and ideas.They send all the surveys and advertising over there and it's open season.Also threads from forums that are off topic. The posters sometimes find them and they can stay awhile but random people will butt in so no place for serious discussion.Takes some getting used to but they're a good bunchNight, night Westiegal, sweet dreams.Edited: 5:38 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"Well I am still seeing this on the Support Forum - don’t know about everybody else.Yes, the OTC forum is not for everybody and some of the threads can get more than a little heated, other are just utter nonsense. Toopaz has explained it very well! You can get threads removed if they do meet guidelines but it is way more complicated that on other forums and an actual TA person has to make the final decision.Edited: 6:03 pm, March 01, 2020 "
That should read do not meet guidelines.
"Westiegal3, the OTC forum is the Off Topic Chatter forum, and can be found under the list of forums in the Beyond Destinations forums.Below is a link to it.https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowForum-g1-i…"
"Yes thank you sun magic, I found it and it's pretty rubbish if you ask me. My main question is which forum are we on here. I can only find this thread through my posts ???"
"Yes, this rather odd thread is in the TA Support Forum??Hunt"
"It is in the TA Support forum, just look up the top of your screen, it says which forum you are in."
But you've got to give it it's due.Over 400 posts. The most popular and cheerful the forum has had for a while :-)
Too bad all this good will couldn’t spill over into some of the other forums.
"Hello Sunmagic,We would recommend you reach out to TripAdvisor via our contact form on http://www.tripadvisor.com/OwnerSupport . We have a team dedicated to Owner Support that would be happy to help you with your Tax residence certificate query.Kind regards,Janine.TripAdvisor Customer Relations Team."
So why did you not move the post there in the first place?
I don't think Sunmagic is interested in 'reaching out' but the OP was.
Not again ..........!SWT
Yes good point. Clueless.
"Janine (and Barbara who has also posted in this thread), sunmagic is the Destination Expert for Leeds and Bradford, UK. It is Sasha, the OP who has the tax certificate question, from Tbilisi, Georgia who needs help.Sasha has been referred a few times to the Owners' Forum, with the steps to take to get there. I think at this point, 4 days after the OP, it would be most helpful if Staff simply reached out to Sasha. I can't see if s/he has posted in the Owners' Forum, or received the assistance s/he needs, but you can. S/he may be a bit lost at this point."
"SunMagic #411,I would just take the help. You will never get TA to understand.Best of luck,Hunt"
Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth!
TA staff really haven't got a clue! It is truly unbelievable.
