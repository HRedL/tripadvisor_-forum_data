"If your urgent situation is anything other than a close family member in Beijing needing your presence, you need to reconsider.

But if you have an address (i.e. family member where you will stay) in Beijing, you may do quarantine there as long as you are not showing symptoms of illness and your plane hasn't been found with an ill passenger on board."
