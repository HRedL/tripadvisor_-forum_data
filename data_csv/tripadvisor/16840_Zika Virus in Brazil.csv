There is no treatment.”“Because of El Niño this year, Brazil’s weather has been unusually hot and rainy, and it will probably grow hotter, with more mosquitoes before the Olympics begin this summer….”http://nyti.ms/1VoEm3W"

Do you advise yellow fever and dengue fever vaccines for Rio? We will be there for 5 days in Feb.?
You really don't need a yellow fever shot for Rio and the vaccine for dengue fever is very new and difficult to get.http://bit.ly/1OqKL91Just follow the usual precautions about avoiding mosquito bites and you should be all right.Edited: 4 years ago 
"Okay, be straight with me because I'm getting mixed signals. Would you advise staying from Brazil if pregnant?The reality (relating to my other thread) is that my wife is already pregnant, I just wasn't ready to announce it yet. She will be 5-6 months by April when we would be going. In this thread you say things should be fine with precautions, but every post in my thread seems to be doom and gloom. So what do you think?"
"RifDimashq: Elena C (Post #10) was asking about getting vaccinated for yellow fever and dengue fever, apparently not realizing that there were other threads relating to those concerns. I assumed pregnancy was not an issue with her, which is why I said, ""Just follow the usual precautions about avoiding mosquito bites and you should be all right.""Re the Zika virus and women who are pregnant or who are thinking of becoming pregnant: I would advise these women not to come to Brazil at this time because the Health Ministry in Brazil announced yesterday that more than three thousand cases of microcephaly in newborns linked to the Zika virus were reported in the country as of January 2nd.http://bit.ly/1PKq8bg"
Zika Virus: What you should know:http://wb.md/1ZbEq7r
"To Protect against Zika Virus, pregnant women are warned about Latin American trips:Officials at Brazil’s Health Ministry were not available for comment Friday night. Hours earlier, Philip Wilkinson, a spokesman for the Rio 2016 organizing committee, said that Olympic venues “will be inspected on daily basis during the Rio 2016 Games to ensure there are no puddles of stagnant water and therefore minimize the risk of coming into contact with mosquitos.”nytimes.com/2016/…"
U.S. Issues Travel Alert to Brazil due to Zika Virus:riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/…
"In the campaign against the Zika virus, Brazil has deployed soldiers to destroy habitats where mosquitoes thrive.nytimes.com/2016/…"
"You need to talk with your physician, look at Web sites such as CDC and think carefully about the risks and the necessity for your travel. TA is a great site for many things but less so for medical advice, IMHO. Should you defer travel? Your decision. If I say you'll be okay, or that the risks are too high, that means little. Keeping down pools of stagnant water throughout the country is a huge task. In Fortaleza, the city has not yet widespread use of fogging trucks. Lots of pools of standing water after recent rains. A new article in the New York Times. nytimes.com/2016/… Tourism and other officials may be downplaying the risks, but, then I'd expect that in most places.The outbreak is relatively recent and the risks still being measured."

"Zika virus scare spreads as Brazil gears up for Carnaval and the Olympics: ""The Olympic and Paralympic venues will be inspected on a daily basis,"" said Philip Wilkinson, a spokesman for Rio 2016, adding that organizers are following guidance from local and federal health officials. He noted that the August weather, near the end of the local winter, will be less propitious for mosquitoes than if the Olympic games were held in the summer.http://bit.ly/1nlUUhR"
"For now,the CDC is being extra cautious: ""Because it is impossible to completely prevent mosquito bites, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised pregnant women to avoid going to regions where Zika is being transmitted, and has advised women thinking of becoming pregnant to consult doctors before going.""OP wouldn't be lodged at the venues, of course, and ""inspections"" is a bit vague,but having less rain does help the situation."
"Five more babies have died in Brazil due to the Zika virus, the government announced on Wednesday.According to the latest report by the country's health ministry, the five deaths happened in northeastern Brazil, the worst region hit by Zika.Brazil has registered 3,893 cases of microcephaly, suspected of being caused by Zika. Among these cases, 224 have been confirmed related to the virus, while the others are still under investigation.Scientists in Brazil have recently confirmed that Zika does manage to infect fetuses through the placenta and put baby's life at risk, leaving afflictions like mental retardation, cerebral palsy, blindness and hearing loss.The virus is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito and could lead to microcephaly, a neurological disorder in which infants are born with smaller craniums and brains."

"Health experts fear Carnaval celebrations will lead to the spread of the Zika virus.Nancy Bellei, the coordinator of the virology clinic at the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases, said that the combination of millions on the streets with the outbreak of the Zika virus represented an “explosive cocktail” that could spread the disease further across the country.In Rio de Janeiro, there are also concerns about the possible spread of the disease during the Olympic Games, which begin in August.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/21/zika-virus…"

there are warnings for pregnant women not to travel to brazil because they will get birth defects but what about single women who travel to Brazil this year?

"HelloI want to visit Rio in May. How is situation with Dengue in this period, is safe or do you suggest to make a trip later ?Regards"
It will be cooler in May and perhaps there will be fewer mosquitoes.
"About Dengue, it is not a disease that would make most people change plans , most cases are Flu like symptoms (high fever, etc.), in a week or so most people are better. In Brazil, death rate by Dengue is 38.8 for 100,000 infected people according to this website: www.deepask.com/goes… .About ZIca, the risk for other people besides the pregnant is the guillain barré, which affects 2 of each 1000 infected people by zica: https://news.yahoo.com/brazil-urges-pregnant…"
"i & my wife will go rio this friday, if she is not planning pregnant within 2 years, if we got Zika Virus unfortunately, does it matter ? the virus will hide in our body?"
"From the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention): Q: “If a woman who is not pregnant is bitten by a mosquito and infected with Zika virus, will her future pregnancies be at risk?”A: “We do not know the risk to the infant if a woman is infected with Zika virus while she is pregnant. Zika virus usually remains in the blood of an infected person for only a few days to a week. The virus will not cause infections in an infant that is conceived after the virus is cleared from the blood. There is currently no evidence that Zika virus infection poses a risk of birth defects in future pregnancies. A women contemplating pregnancy, who has recently recovered from Zika virus infection, should consult her healthcare provider after recovering.”"
"CDC Director Tom Friedan said, ""There have been isolated cases of the Zika virus spread through blood transfusion or sexual contact and that's not very surprising. The virus is in the blood for about a week. How long it would remain in the semen is something that needs to be studied and we're working on that now."""

"More than 35 million citizens of Brazil live without drinking water and one hundred million have no sewage system. The lack of basic sanitation is one of the factors which has led to the proliferation of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which transmits the Zika virus, dengue and chikungunya fever. http://bit.ly/1U7S0JR"

In total, 272 athletes from 49 countries and regions will compete for 88 spots in the Rio Olympic diving competition."
"""...some researchers are theorizing that Zika is contributing to an unexpectedly high rate of side effects because it is spreading in a population in which a large number of people have been previously infected with a closely related virus, dengue.The theory — and it’s only that right now — is that prior infection with one or more of the four dengue viruses may be contributing to a spike in Brazil’s cases of neurological complications among some adults infected with Zika and cases of microcephaly — underdeveloped heads and brains — in some infants born to women infected with the virus during pregnancy.""Source: BusinessInsiders.com 2/11/16"
Check all this out with the CDC website and other medical sites. We are Seniors and have relatives in Brazil and are trying to cancel/reroute travel already paid for. CDC says Zika in addition to birth defects may be also linked to Guillian Barre which affects all ages. There has been a significant increase very recently in that rare disease in areas where Zika is now endemic in Brazil. CDC has info on Dengue. Check yourself but I understand this is spread by the same mosquito potentially at same time and has serious consequences for those with heart disease and can cause this for people who don't get immediate medication - pulse down to 40-45. People who see Cardialogists should ask theirs for sure! There is no immunity built up for Dengue and subsequent infections are worse. Thankfully there is anticipated to be a vaccine for Dengue and Chikungunyga a related similar malady in approx. 2 years. I pray they are able to do same for Zika by then if not earlier.
"actually, there is acquired immunity for EACH type of dengue. unfortunately, there are 4 types of dengue.straight from World Health Organization:""There are 4 distinct, but closely related, serotypes of the virus that cause dengue (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4). Recovery from infection by one provides lifelong immunity against that particular serotype. However, cross-immunity to the other serotypes after recovery is only partial and temporary. Subsequent infections by other serotypes increase the risk of developing severe dengue.""www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs117/en/and there is already a vaccine against dengue developed by a French lab. It is slowly getting approvals from health authorities on a country by country basis. So far, Mexico, the Philippines and Brazil have approved it.But it has some downsides: cost; it has to be taken in three doses over a 12-month-period; it is recommended for individuals from 9-45 years of age; and it only offers about 60% protection when all 4 types of dengue are taken into account.who.int/immunization/…sanofipasteur.com/en/…"

For this reason, many people might not realize they have been infected.Zika virus usually remains in the blood of an infected person for about a week.Once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections."

I didn't even have to wear mosquito repellant, and if these critters are around, they usually feast on me! :-) Sadly, twenty would-be travelers canceled their tour because of the Zika scare, reducing the tour group to six. Since the Olympics take place in August, which is winter, I wonder how serious a problem Zika really is or if the twenty-four hour news cycle has just found a new story to churn out and is needlessly scaring people away from the beautiful country of Brazil and the city of Rio? Of course, follow the advice of your physician, but . . . . it all makes me wonder.Edited: 4 years ago "

"How to avoid mosquito bites:Wear long sleeves, long pants, socks, and closed-toe shoes.Avoid tight clothes (mosquitoes can bite through them), dark colors, and perfume or aftershave (both attract them).Apply a good repellent to exposed skin and to your clothes, too (but never under them). You can purchase clothes treated with the repellent permethrin.

"I've just returned from Rio and didn't even see a single mosquito, even by the rowing lake and mossies love me. There could be mosquitoes further out of the city but if you're visiting the central area, Copacabana, Ipanema, Maracana stadium and near the rowing lake then I can't see that they'd be a problem."

Its way too cold here now for Mosquitos. Don't believe the negative hype! Mosquitos thrive in hot humid places. People are complaining about Zika which has been around since 1948 but more people die from Dengue. Right now there are no mosquitos out as far as I can see.

"Brazil's government on Thursday (May 11) declared an end to a national emergency over the Zika virus which was detected in late in 2015 before becoming a global concern.Brazil has informed the World Health Organisation, citing ""the decrease in cases of Zika and microcephaly throughout the country,"" the health ministry said in a statement.The health ministry said that from January to April this year there had been 7,911 Zika cases, 95.3 per cent down on the same period in 2016 when there were 170,535 cases."

"Cases of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika have fallen 88.9 percent so far this year, compared with the same period in 2016, the Health Ministry said Monday.In the first four months of this year, Brazil registered 113,381 suspected cases of dengue, 43,010 cases of chikungunya and 7,911 cases of Zika, the ministry said.The 113,381 dengue cases and 17 deaths registered up to April 15 stands in stark contrast with the more than 1.18 million cases and 507 deaths seen in the same period last year.The three epidemics raged in 2016, which registered the second-largest number of dengue cases since 1990, only after 2015. Last year also saw record numbers of Zika and chikungunya cases, both appearing in Brazil in the recent two years."
"Two experimental vaccines being developed with the help of Brazilian scientists have been shown to protect the fetus of mice from being infected by the Zika virus, according to an article published today.Scientists from Brazil's Evandro Chagas Institute, in the northern state of Para, have participated in the research, whose results were published by the specialized magazine ""Cell.""Since late 2015, Brazil has been grappling with a Zika epidemic, now waning, that was linked to birth defects in infants born to mothers bitten by the carrier mosquito during pregnancy.Cases of microcephaly, or babies born with abnormally small heads, rose significantly in Brazil following the spread of the mosquito-borne virus.The vaccine research also involves scientific teams from the University of Washington, the University of Texas and the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.The vaccines appear to effectively block the transmission of the Zika virus to the fetus, the magazine said."

"Drug blocks Zika and dengue viruses in study:http://bit.ly/2msJkDc“Our report shows, for the first time, that we can use a small-molecule inhibitor to block infection by the flaviviridae family of viruses,” Joseph Contessa, M.D., said. “This group includes Zika, dengue, West Nile, and yellow fever viruses, which affect hundreds of millions of people per year worldwide.”"
A study by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) in Pernambuco has revealed that the Zika virus arrived in Brazil from Haiti.https://bit.ly/2wivhoH
A test kit to detect the Zika Virus has been marketed in Brazil.The test is the result of a research started two years ago by a group of researchers from the Institute of Biomedical Sciences of the University of São Paulo. The kits are mainly intended for women of childbearing age and for epidemiological studies to find people who have already been exposed to the virus.
Brazil has reported recent cases of Zika Virus. There is limited information available and there may be delays in reporting new cases.https://bit.ly/2LVCpze
