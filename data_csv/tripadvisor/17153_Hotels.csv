Are hotels closing tomorrow in Innsbruck/Lans area due to COVID19 Epidemic Act? Not sure if this area comes under the Tyrol.
"Yes, all hotels in Tyrol close. All foreign visitors are supposed to leave the country."
Tyrol is under emergency measures that go further than the general restrictions that come into force in Austria on Monday 16th March. All individuals who are not normally resident in Tyrol are required to leave the State. They are not required to leave Austria - just to leave Tyrol.
"You are right, sorry, I meant the state (Bundesland) Tyrol."
