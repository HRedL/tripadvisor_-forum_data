"I have been seeing travel alerts in the newspaper and on the CDC website all of Mexico and the Caribbean is at high alert for Dengue fever, which is potentially fatal and carried by mosquitoes. Should we aviod travel here at this time? We want to go to Cabo at the endf of this month. Thanks!"
GO They have NEVER had a case of Dengue fever in Cabo
"I also say go. We just got home from a week in Cabo and didn't see a single mosquito. Cabo is a desert, not tropical like most of the rest of Mexico."
"Sorry, but I live in Cabo and have had Dengue Fever,not the fatal type that is now present but Dengue nevertheless."
Hey Trapper...might want to read this article from 2003...there might be more...but this certain goes against your strong NEVER answer...bajainsider.com/archive/dengue/inside-dengue…
Travel Judy???/What up sweety-30 day to Maui and counting!!!!your amigomex25
"I have yet to be bitten by a mosquito in Cabo, and I'm one of those people that mosquitos love to bite. They always bite me, and not my husband! But, for whatever the reason (weather or whatever), I've never been bitten in Cabo.Bring bug repellent and use it if you're worried, but you should still go to Cabo. Don't let fear make you miss out on a great vacation."
"I would certainly not put off a trip there, but would use caution. While some say they have never seen a mosquito there, I can say that I have-now-only about 5 in all my visits, and did get a couple of bites-as they LOVE me, and if I haven't loaded up on the Vit. B, they will bite me, but they are far fewer there than in other parts of the country. There are a couple of sunscreens out that have repellent in them-I'm thinking perhaps BullFrog.........and possibly even Blue Lizard, which just may be the best sunscreen out there!"
"Dengue fever is only common in tropical areas...and carried by mosquitos and certain flies in those aeras. Cabo is FAR from tropical....lol. I have never been bitten by a mosquito in all my trips to cabo. The only thing that got me were sand fleas a few time........so, no worries!Cabo_nut"
"While Cabo is not tropical, there are mosquitoes there occasionally. With the water traps at golf courses, ponds at resorts and the possibility of standing water, just about any place can have them.........last Dec., during my PG stay I asked the housekeeper to please spray, as there was at least one in the bedroom-and I didn't want to have to sleep totally swathed from head to toe in the sheet. I still would go back on a weekly basis if only I could :-) Taking one of the vit. B's does work, I just never remember which B is is, so take the multi-B..........but still get the occasional nasty little fellow that didn't read the book that says they won't bite ;-)"
"Hey Mex25...packed yet to Hawaii!! Maybe you can swing by Zihua on your way home for lunch with me??? That would be fun. Dengue fever is a very serious problem in all of Mexico...it is the daytime mosquito...and with hurricane season here, rain, it only takes one bite to get it. Cabo is NOT exempt...don't ever believe it. When you or someone who you care about gets it...then you will know what we are talking about and warning you all about. IT DOES HAPPEN...and you all need to read the CDC websites and to listed to Kat and me. We travel a lot and know the CDC websites and have known people with it. I was tested for it this winter...right when I got back from my last trip in Mexico...try to go to a doctor that has never heard of it, can't spell it...and had to call the CDC to get more information about it...then he laughed as he called me back...and said that i sounded like a CDC recording...because I had already told him all the symptoms, the aches, the pains and the high fever...it isn't called the Broken Bone syndrome for nothing..."
"Hi Judy! You are giving me way more credit than I deserve, but your warning is certainly important! Check out those sunscreens, folks-double duty protection :-)"
"not more than you deserve kat, judy what clinic back here, in case i get it then they will be familiar, With the tons of them back here don't bring it back with you to our tropical garden area. Kat like your vitiamin expo but wish I also knew which one esp during our 10,000 Mosquito season. As I have expounded before, during the digging of the original Panama Canal, it was discovered that people who ate bananas secreted oils from their skin that attracted the malaria carrying ones so maybe some type of foods also causes attraction of this type of Mosquito. Kat did you try the lavendar out for other creepy crawlers?"
"You know-I haven't used it yet, but haven't seemed to have anymore of the little ""buggers""! Perhaps it was the mega spider spray! ;-)I think it might be B-1, but I just do the multiple.........there are those that swear it works (I quit getting sand flea bites at Aptos after I started taking it also) and those that say it's a load of ****.......all I know is that it works for me :-)"
"TravelJudy, How many cases of Dengue fever have been recorded in Cabo...let me tell you...NONE!. Why put everyone in an uproar? I agree, people should be cautious, but not panicked. If you would read the resources you are siting, you would see that Cabo San Lucas is not included in the threat or outbreak area it is only mainland Mexico, not Baja. Here is the CDC website cdc.gov/travel/other/2006/dengue_tropical_su…  There is a link to a map showing the areas with epidemic activity and areas that have the Aedes aegypti mosquito....Cabo Has neither. Now if this were the Cancun forum or PV forum...I think your words would be waranted...but not here on this board.Cabo_nut"
"Thanks to allof you for you advice. Travel Judy, you seem pretty knowledgeable. So what do you say? We want to go somewhere tropical, but it seems all of those areas are under alert. Any info?? Any suggestions? "
"ShellNGreg, Go where you want, don't live your life in fear. You have a much better chance of getting in an accident on the way to the airport than catching Dengue fever...just use precaution like the other posters have mentioned.Cabo_nut"
ShellNGreg...let Cabo nut be your guide...he seems to know so much about things... I am out of here... Remember during the hurricanes how much water the area gets...and the outbreaks...but of course some memories get short on things like that...KatD is the expert in the Cabo area...listen to her...come to Zihuatanejo or Ixtapa and I can help you. Don't worry...but CORRECT KNOWLEDGE is important. 
"TravelJudy....I was only stating the facts, not hypothetical rhetoric of what ""Might"" happen. I just take exception to people over reacting about things. I agree with you that people should take precautions....but if someone is showing a fear of something...as this poster was...I chose to give them the facts to ease their rears instead of feed them. The Aedes mosquito breeds in tropical regions only not in the dry, arid desert regioons found on the baja. There risk is much greater getting hit by a bus walking in cabo than getting Dengue. I didn't mean to upset you or belittle you...just giving the facts to avoid a panic.Cabo_nut"
"During hurricane season it is the same as conditions in the tropics. We have very high humidity and after the rains we have stagnant water and yes, we do have cases of Dengue down here. During hurricane season the people in the colonies are constantly warned and are told to spray. The main tourist areas are sprayed constantly during hurricane season."
"Cabogirl, Why wouldn't the CDC add Cabo to its map of epidemics and the area where Aedes mosquitoes are found, especially knowing what a large tourist destination it is? Cabo_nut?"
We are in means having cases in epidemic proportions but each year the threat becomes larger. There are now two different strains and one is fatal. The number of cases in Mexico is increasing every year. As stated I have had it and it is a horrible sickness.
"Risk? Fear? Lots of fear for lots of things that are such a teeny, tiny risk and not enough fear for the BIGGIES.Car accidents....read the statistics and then wonder why so many don't wear seatbelts or buy cars with crappy crash test results or don't replace their tires at the right time.......?Heart Disease, that is what everyone should be worried about...that is how most of us are going to be crippled and killed yet that doesn't slow down the Fast Food visits. Do you see what people fill their shopping carts with? Want to be afraid? Then be afraid of that creamer in your coffee in the morning whose second ingredient is hydrogenated oil, which is transfat, a fat the FDA determined 20 years ago could not be consumed at ANY safe level. a fat the Harvard Medical school and othe top research centers attributed to 100,000 premature deaths a year in the US, a chemically altered fat that the body doesn't know what to do with so it sticks on the lining of your arteries while it raises LDL and lowers the lifesaving HDL.Diabetes?...now THERE is a bonafide epidemic for you."
"We have the same type of ""issue"" in the area I live here in Calif. with the up and coming West Nile Virus. It has been showing its ugly head in the last 4-5 years. Comes in the summer hot months transferred by mosquitoes as well. You know its has arrived for the summer with blue jays and crows dying and they get hard hit by it for some reason, but people can and have contracted it as well. Especially hard on elderly people. I have had dead birds on my property. However, I have not contracted this virus. Will I move?? No,...(unless its to Cabo). There is always a threat of ""what ifs"" but not to change our plans for life."
"But Cabogirl......did you get it in Cabo? We all realize that dengue fever is a bad thing...But the original poster was concerned about getting it in Cabo....To which I just pointed out the facts outlined in the CDC website.....They didn't ask if they should go to mainland Mexico, The carribean or Asia.......They asked about Cabo. No need feeding their fears with irrelivance.Cabo_nut"
West Nile virus fatalities in California 2005 = 19Car accident fatalities in California 2005 = 4200
"Okay...................it's time to stop all the nit-picky stuff here, and get back the Baja attitude.......ShellNGreg asked a legitimate question, and have recieved some very valid answers.let's not turn this into a real snit thread, please.Here are a couple of things I found for anyone that would like to take the time to read them. I shall continue to travel to Baja, and will continue to be cautious in all my travels.......not just of mosquitos, but busses, cars, etc. :-)Dengue, a rapidly expanding disease in most tropical and subtropical areas of the world, has become the most important arboviral disease of humans. More than 2.5 billion persons now live in areas at risk of infection, and an estimated 50 million–100 million cases of dengue fever occur each year, 200,000–500,000 of which are DHF. The case-fatality rate for DHF averages 5%. Epidemics caused by all four virus serotypes have become progressively more frequent and larger in the past 20 years. As of 2002, dengue fever is endemic in most tropical countries of the South Pacific, Asia, the Caribbean, the Americas, and Africa. Additionally, most tropical urban centers in these regions have multiple dengue virus serotypes co-circulating (hyperendemicity), which increases dengue transmission and the risk of DHF. Future dengue incidence in specific locales cannot be predicted accurately, but a high level of dengue transmission is anticipated in all tropical areas of the world for the indefinite future. The incidence of the severe disease, DHF, has increased dramatically in Southeast Asia, the South Pacific, and the American tropics in the past 20 years, with major epidemics occurring in many countries every 3–5 years. DHF is an emerging disease in the Americas. The first major epidemic occurred in Cuba in 1981, and a second major epidemic of DHF occurred in Venezuela in 1989 and 1990. Since then, outbreaks or sporadic cases, or both, of confirmed DHF have occurred in 28 tropical American countries. After an absence of 35 years, a small number of autochthonous cases of dengue fever have been documented in the continental United States (southern Texas in 1980, 1986, and 1995), associated with imported cases and epidemic dengue in adjacent states in Mexico. After an absence of 56 years, a limited outbreak of dengue fever occurred in Hawaii in 2001, associated with imported cases and epidemic dengue in the South Pacific. November 6, 2006 Dengue Fever Outbreaks in Mexican Coastal Areas Francisco Cardoza, Secretary of Health of Baja California Sur, reported that the increase in dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever cases in Los Cabos, BCS, Mexico, that total 63, requires strengthened epidemiological measures. The state agency has sent 70 additional workers to support the 40 who are working to lower larvae indices of the mosquito that transmits dengue fever and to control the outbreak. In Acapulco, Guerrero, authorities report a rise of 166 dengue cases in just six days, in both of its manifestations, which brings the total to 1,156 cases in this tourist destination. The Secretariat of Health has invested [US$1.4 million] in the fight against the transmitting mosquito. The incidence of dengue, that in its hemorrhagic fever form is life threatening, remains at high levels in the states of Veracruz, Guerrero and Quintana Roo, where 10,757 cases and five deaths have been recorded this year due to the resistance of the people to collaborate in official prevention programs, and in programs to fight the mosquito that transmits the disease.

"I just returned from Cabo and while in spending a week in Cabo San Lucas we did not see a mosquito and were out day and night. We then spent three nights on the corridor close to San Jose Del Cabo and saw quite a few mosquitos. I would not cancel a trip due to this as most vacation spots outside the U.S. come with some risk, but do take precautions and enjoy your vacation. "
"Yes, I got it here in Cabo. I have lived here for 8 years before many more prudent precautions were in place. Many of you have never seen mosquitoes down here but that is because you do not live here you come for vacations at optimum times of the year when you do not have blistering heat, 100% humidity, stagnant pools of water, raw sewage problems, hurricanes or torrential downpours.The chances of contacting this disease are very rare almost as rare as being on the flight with the man with the deathly strain of TB... so are you all going to stop living out of fear?...not me"
"Kat, the only ""snit"" if you read the thread chronologically was Travel Judy snidely saying to listen to Cabo nut because he knows everything and she was outta here!Yes, ShellNGregs question was completely reasonable and legitimate and Cabo nut was just giving perspective to the Dengue answer.And as for my posts on the subject it did hit a nerve with me, as it did others, with the constant hyping and fear mongering that passes for news these days.There is only one thing scientifically proven to prevent mosquito bites and that is DEET, which should be used sparingly."
"Okay...........now lets get back to being friendly and not picking at each other, please. One of the best things about the Cabo pages is that we all get along reasonably well, and unlike other forums, we don't have to snipe at each other. Everyone made some excellent points and I'm sure ShellNGreg are making their decisions wisely. Let's not chase them away. To each his own, or however that quote goes :-)"
"Ok as Kat said enough is enough. As my son says life is a crap shoot but as I counter, you don't go out of your way to become a statistic. As always be aware of your surroundings and take necessary precautions, if that means traveling at certain times and not others adjust. If it means taking vitamins then do. The more educated and aware one is the more they can lessen chances. That is what I love about the forum, it is an open communication. So maybe an issue that gets dragged out needs to be. I am not here to judge, only learn so I can benefit or be of benefit. "
"They did-if you looked at the map, all of Mexico is in red."
"Sorry, new at this post thing, above I was responding to Cabo Nut's question about why the CDC didn't show Cabo as being affected. Apparently you didn't look at the website. Anyway, back to our question at hand, and thank you, enough of the banter about who's right and who's wrong. That does not do us any good. No, I don't believe I live my life in fear. My point is that we are not set on Cabo, we wanted to go anywhere reasonably close by plane and tropical. This is our continued honeymoon trip, we got married last summer, and spent most of the trip on excursions with not much downtime. We just want to go the beach! Now that apparently all of the Caribbean and Mexico is in the ""RED"" according to CDC, I don't know where to go. Time is running out, we wanted to leave at the end of this month. I just want other's opinions and experiences that will help guide this decision. It's difficult because they keep conflicting."
"If it was me, I would go."
"Cabo is not tropical. It is a dry desert.Go to Cabo.....end of June is still very dry season...no worries.....I've never, ever seen a mosquito in Cabo in the resort areas."
