We have trip to Bali planned through end of March on China Airlines. I know this is quite a ways a way but I'm wondering if the epidemic may change/hinder plans event though we will not be arriving or leaving from the Mainland. We only have 3 hour layover each way - coming from SFO (California)
"""if the epidemic may change/hinder plans event"" by the end of MarchWho do u expect to know the answer?"
Hi Dan are you going on a FAM trip to Bali?
Taoyuan airport is safe and cleaned permanently. Taiwan is bot China. They ALL wear masks and disinfect their hand 12 times a day !Nothing to worry about in this country.
Just traveled through this airport two days ago. It’s impeccably clean and everyone is wearing masks etc. We also used China Airlines and they were fantastic. You will be fine! Have fun in Bali!
Hi! Just want to confirm that you flew through Taipei to/from Bali without any issues? I’d love to know if Bali’s travel ban applies to Taiwan.
"@AdrianL: ""Just want to confirm that you flew through Taipei to/from Bali without any issues? I’d love to know if Bali’s travel ban applies to Taiwan""If you check flight info like Flightradar24 etc u will see the daily flights between TPE and DPS for both CI and Eva are still operating normally so obviously no ban.We are at TPE at the moment transiting KUL-TPE-AMS. We landed at 7pm, it's now 9pm, and Terminal 1 at least is pretty deserted as is CI's business lounge. It is indeed spotless and nearly everyone is wearing a mask. But with zero crowd density a mask is really not needed. Again one realizes that hand hygiene deserves most of one's focus."
"Hi, did they do temperature checks for you guys? Transiting through Taipei end of March to Bali."
"They have température cameras but I think they are vigilant depending on your country of origin/departure.I have been in taoyuan airport about 6 Times since end of January, and it is more quiet now, as most of flight to and from china have been cancelled."

"Hi, I have recently had a stopover to Taipei airport from SF. It was last Feb.29,2020. First, I commend all EVA Air crew & Taipei airport staff for prioritizing safety of each passengers for wearing masks and having hand sanitizers in almost every corner. The airport is almost empty. Normally, it takes me 20-40 minutes to queue for transit but it only takes 3 minutes to pass the transit gate. Inside the airport, it is so quiet and yes almost empty. Premium Plaza Lounge however is a bit crowded. I stayed in Taipei airport for 3 1/2 hours and feel safe. I hope this helps other travelers as it helped me a lot to read from all its contributors. Thank you."
thank you so much for this great info! glad you're safe.
"It does, thank you! I have an upcoming trip at the first part of April. Great info!"
"Can I leave Taoyuan airport if I'm transiting from Bali, I have a 17 hour stop over, I have been in Bali 2 months which is not yet considered a high risk destination at the moment."
Visitors from most countries are now required to quarentine themselves for 14 days.
Latest News:https:/…202003185007.aspxSince 19th March 0am:1.Passengers without Taiwanese citizenship are not allowed to enter Taiwan.2. All passenger need to be quarantined for 14 days
Transiting passengers are still allowed into the airport? We have a flight from CGK thru TPE to YVR with EVA Friday Mar 20th. I have not read anything abut transiting yea or nea. EVA continues to show flight ok.Trying not to get stuck in transit.Thanks for any guidance.
"Hi Grant, we got the same situation - we're scheduled to leave April 2 and I cannot discern how transits are affected. Let me know if you find out more."
Ban does not apply to transit passengers. It applies to people trying to pass Taiwan immigration and enter Taiwan proper.
great thx. We are heading there now.

"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan announced on Sunday (March 22) that airplane passengers will be banned from making transfers at the nation's airports in a bid to check the risk of coronavirus transmissions.The ban goes into effect on Tuesday (March 24) and will last through April 7, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC). The measure was implemented to curtail cross-border human movement and curb the highly contagious COVID-19.Taiwan reported 16 new Wuhan virus infections on Sunday, 13 of whom were imported cases, bringing the total up to 169. The island country has seen a rise in cases over the past week, with most of them having traveled and studied abroad.https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3902193"
"Hi, does anyone know if foreign nationals transiting through Taipei need to have COVID-19 testing results to get through? I can't seem to find a clear cut answer for this; though it appears only those entering Taiwan or or those travelling from the Philippines would need a negative test result. Since there's no explicit mention that other foreign nationals just transiting through (not leaving the airport) need not have COVID-19 test results, I can only assume it's not needed.Hope someone could confirm? Thanks!"
transit passengers do not need to do the Covid test but must keep the transit period within an 8 hr time span and can only do so with the same airlines.
Thank you very much!
