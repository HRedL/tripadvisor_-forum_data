Would the coronavirus in vegas change your plans?
"If I caught it? Probably,"
I would probably cancel my trip if there is out break there!
"How would you determine an ""outbreak"" ?"
"I live in New York City so if it's anywhere, it's going to be here. So no, unless I was actually sick I wouldn't change my plans."
No. I live miles away in London.:)
"If I heard of an outbreak in Vegas, I would seriously consider postponing my trip. So far, Vegas seems to be safe."
If there are several cases that are tested positive within the city.
Two? Four? Five?Out of a metro area of two million?
"Anyway i sure hope they never have any cases, period."
More people die from the good old Flu everyyear........bla bla bla
Eleven people are listed as Influenza deaths in Nevada this year as of January 11. Why aren’t you canceling your trip now??
I just may do that..
Probably for the best.
"6600 deaths from flu in the US out of 13 million cases. 2700 coronavirus deaths out of 80,000 cases.We've had 120,000 hospitilizations for flu, though. Not sure how many for coronavirus. Wondering to what degree the huge difference in mortality rates between the 2 is the level of treatment we have here compared to where coronavirus is."
My wife says we will still come but wear masks and sanitation suits.
"""My wife says we will still come but wear masks and sanitation suits.""A bit over the top as a flu prevention measure, but each to their own!"
"Yes i agree, we will just bring masks..."
"A group from my office just got back from a convention in Vegas last week. Every single one of the them came home sick. Fever, cough, cold. I'm talking a group of 8 people all sick. They are all fine now. I think we will all live!"
"Thats quite a story, must be lots of flu around...."
"If 4 or 5 cases out of 2 million people in Vegas are of concern (and over the next few months there may well be), then you better hope nobody comes up to Brantford from, say Detroit , and tests positive in your neighborhood.By your standard you would then have to pitch a tent out to the ""safety"" of the wilds of La Verendrye. No resort fees though."
"I won't tell who I work for, but we have a conference coming up soon and the company has decided to uninvite certain nations with large infection centers - refunding all fees. They are also instituting a no-touch policy during the conference. People are encouraged not to shake hands or embrace as a greeting. Hopefully this epidemic will start to fade as Spring arrives, but I wouldn't count on the USA looking out for our best interests at this time. It's good to be cautious and mindful - in an appropriate way."
Perhaps a wall would help??
"I would still go to LV, but I would seriously rethink about doing a cruise. All it takes is for one person to have the virus symptoms and who know how your itinerary could change as fear is causing more and more people to say ""not in my city"". Heaven forbid if there is an actual case of the virus on the cruise."
"Omg I was just thinking this. I’m traveling g with my elderly mom as per usual. She’s 86 To Vegas on the 16th of March till the 23rd We are coming as a reprieve from the resent passing of my father / her husband since Vegas always makes her full of joy. While we are watching it I feel as if we will still go. I do t think we are “taking a chance” as some people have told me because we do t live in fear. I am also a bit comforted that China has been recently banned from entering the uS as there are always a lot who stay and gamble at the Wynn This has nothing to do with how sadly I feel for their country’s current predicament and for the poor souls that have been lost , families suffering , people living in true fear and for all the racist and evil retaliation against people of Chinese decent and in fact anyone who is Asian as if it’s our fault the virus exists. I am very heartfelt and sorry for everyone in our world going through this but I pray that 1. They will narrow down how to fight the virus ,2 maybe even a vaccination and 3. That it stops multiplying Other then that you can find me at the Wynn with my heinakin drinking 86 yo Japanese mother enjoying a few nice big wins ;) AlohaEdited: 4:27 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"If we’re going to irrationally ban all Chinese people, why aren’t we irrationally banning Japanese too? Asking for a friend."
"Because Japan doesn’t have as many cases as China does and China was and is the epicenter. 142,000 in China and 157 in japan. get it though it comes across as being super racistEdited: 4:38 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"""142,000 in China and 157 in japan. get it though it comes across as being super racist""The statistics are ""super racist""? Huh?"
Corona Virus so far in its early stages. It spreads rapidly but thankfully U.S. only has 14 cases. Our local Home Depot keeps selling out of face masks EVERYDAY. So obviously many people are being cautious. CDC says vaccine is still 12-16 months away. That is not too reassuring. I will NOT cancel my trip in April.
No banning of a center people can seem racist.
I live in Omaha and they fly them here to be treated and no one is trying to stop them here. Maybe it's a midwest thing but we just want to help them get better should not matter what nationality they are.
No banning of a center people can seem racist.But the reality is that it was done to try and help curb the spread of the disease. Now why they haven’t banned japan Irishfan is probably based on the amount of cases. Nevertheless I have seen in my own Chinatown how people stopped supporting stores and restaurants because they are fearful and ill informed. I’ve read about cases in Europe where people of Asian decent are being treated poorly and being attacked. It’s absolutely ridiculous
Them as in Americans who returned to the US and is infected correct ?
"""No banning of a center people can seem racist.""I have no idea what this sentence means."
“ I am also a bit comforted that China has been recently banned from entering the uS as there are always a lot who stay and gamble at the Wynn”“ Nevertheless I have seen in my own Chinatown how people stopped supporting stores and restaurants because they are fearful and ill informed.

"Actually I can see how that is super racist and a total contradiction. Thanks for setting me straight. I too must somewhat be living in fear. Thanks irishfan for that Changing perspectiveEdited: 5:00 pm, February 25, 2020 "
Sorry I meant banning of a certain people. Forgive my fat fingers
"I somehow managed to not only survive in Vegas last week, I didn’t even get sick. Neither did my wife. I also believe millions of locals managed to stay healthy, though I do not have I forgot back that claim up. 13"
"""but I wouldn't count on the USA looking out for our best interests at this time.""SFimporter better hope that his local government then does a better job than it has with the needles, feces, & bodies on sidewalks should people up there start getting it.And some will, given the massive amount of far east intersectional travel to the west coast."
"""Sorry I meant banning of a certain people.""It's not banning certain people. It's banning people from certain areas or who have been in certain areas. The epicenter is China so naturally more Asians than other groups."
"Depending on severity, yes, I would change plans. CDC says we will eventually get an outbreak in the US. Flying seems like a bad idea at that point. Vegas seems like a perfect storm. People visiting from all regions of the world. Buffets- everyone touching the serving utensils. Slot machines- gross and germy on a good day. Best to avoid high concentrations of people if there is a pandemic. Flip side... maybe low occupancy and some great deals?"
"The Coronavirus threads are multiplying like a, well, virus."
"Hunt,I’ve heard MGM has the vaccine already, and is preparing to institute a mandatory “vaccination upon check in policy.”This added cost to MGM will be passed along to the customer via an increase in the dreaded resort fee. No doubt, this will be the last straw for many and the boycotts shall finally begin after years of threatening them! 13Edited: 11:40 pm, February 25, 2020 "
Last time we flew to Vegas the person directly behind me cough all whole trip. It was one of those wet coughs and he never covered his mouth. I think all airlines should have a box of masks and if a passenger is coughing they should request that person use the mask. It does not have to be because of this particular virus but should be standard procedures when flying. JMO
"FireballXO9 identified as coronavirus OP-1.Sorry, but my Pangolin made me do it"
""" I think all airlines should have a box of masks and if a passenger is coughing they should request that person use the mask."" - I prefer a bag of masks, but we can work out those semantics later.13"
"I was in Las Vegas in February, I did not see anyone wearing mask.I am now in New York City for a week, 2 business trips in NYC in February, 2 weeks, I have not seen anyone wearing mask. None on multiple flights. Not an issue in the US."
"^^^^ ""Anecdotal evidence is evidence of nothing."""
"The common masks are too porous to block the virus anyway. Virus spreads easy but has a mortality rate of under 3% and Gilead has a treatment in phase 1 and Moderna is on track for a vaccine so hopefully this is short lived. People like ripping US healthcare & pharma but never seem to appreciate their positive impact. I’m more worried about someone with the flu sitting next to me on the flight out. And that worry is dwarfed by the threat of Wisconsin snow messing up my freshly washed car.^^^. Actually the basis of scientific evidence starts with anecdotal evidence. Evidence is a series of anecdotes grouped & compared.Edited: 10:05 am, February 26, 2020 "
"""Actually the basis of scientific evidence starts with anecdotal evidence.

Part two of the saying is, ""The plural of anecdotal evidence is not facts."" But there's no point getting into it with you so I won't post again in response."
"i loved the post about office mates going on a business trip and coming back sick. mainly because it's so strange when that happens, and also because it's so relevant to coronavirus."
"the scientific method is the opposite of anecdotal. i think people struggle with the fact that best explanations based on experimentation and evidece can and do change over time because we develop better instruments to perform and measure experiments over time. newton and einstein were great physicists, but their theories for gravity are still being revised.Edited: 10:40 am, February 26, 2020 "
"espn, extremely well put."
"The plural of anecdotal evidence is not factsYou get that from Vox or Wikipedia again? That’s meaningless in science as science is about evidence, it can only support or disprove. If you think science is about proof or facts, you don’t understand science. Anecdotes drive research. A series of individual observations (Anecdotes) drives the need to examine if those observations are different from the norms. Anecdotal observations spark the question “ meaningful difference or outlier.”"
"Anecdotes are used in science all the time, especially epidemiology. Not to support but to inspire further investigation ( research ). Anecdotal evidence is used all the time appropriately in science and thank God it does or we would be using leaches & whiskey as cures.Edited: 11:14 am, February 26, 2020 "
Observation is not the same as anecdote. I think you mean that scientists develop avenues of inquiry based on what they observe. That's correct.
"The corona virus is contained , or so we are told by Blotus...Bloviator ofThe United StatesEdited: 11:36 am, February 26, 2020 "
Observation is not the same as anecdote.In science an observation is anecdotal as it has not been supported or disproved through examination for difference. It was anecdotal evidence that inspired science to examine cigarette smoking and lung cancer. This is how many epidemiologist recognize connections and inspire research.

"We have been practicing good vegas hygiene for years now. Will do the same for this trip. We bring sanitizers in the form of wipes and hand lotion. We wipe down our VP machine and use the hand lotion . Don’t rub your nose, eyes or mouth while playing also. We use the toilet seat covers in the bathrooms and wash our hands every time. This effort goes a long way to prevent illness. As for the masks those only work for people who are sick that cough and sneeze. It will help contain their problem but won’t work to block the flu from getting in your nose. You can also buy swabs at CVS that are anti virus to swab inside your nose and kill any virus before it creeps into your lungs. These casinos are open and large so unless your within 6 feet of a sick person you should be at a lower risk. Doing these very basic things goes a long way to prevent illness. I wish everyone would use the wipes on machines. Nothing is fool proof but this will greatly lower your risk. Praying for a good outcome for everyone."
Or 69 out of 100 million
"I posted earlier about rethinking going on a cruise because of the fear factor, not my fear but the public's fear, and now a cruise ship is being denied permission to dock in Jamaica and the Cayman islands because a crew member test positive for Type A influenza.“The crew member had traveled to Miami from Manila, via direct connection in Istanbul,” MSC said. “He developed symptoms of common flu and tested positive to Type A influenza after he visited the ship’s 24/7 Medical Center while already on board. He has no other symptoms.”The Ministry of Health in Kingston nevertheless said it was acting judiciously to block the ship.“The crew member had a cough, fever and associated muscle pains with a travel history to a country of interest relating to the Covid-19,” the National Ministry of Health in Kingston said in a statement.Edited: 3:38 pm, February 26, 2020 "
"And approximately 73 of 100 million TA posts are actual data - based info ( you know, with P value assigned statistics, etc; the balance is purely anecdotal). Either can be Vegas - useful, entertaining..or not. This one is not, according to applied ANOVA tests."
Not so far
"if international flights are involved, i think it’s safer to postpone your trip. restrictions can change daily and your itinerary could be affected. in terms of infection risk, i think the risk is pretty much the same by now in every tourist destination."
I’m planning to be there in March. I’m bring Purell wipes and plan to use them after I play slots. If there’s a bad outbreak I might postpone to another date. I’m not sure.
Alcohol consumption will kill most viruses. I read on the internet that it helps prevent Ebola! So I'm not changing my plans except I plan to drink more!
"While chances of catching Coronavirus is as likely as hitting a $1,000,000 jackpot playing penny slots, a few cases in Las Vegas, and the crowds will disappear...won’t be a ghost town , but big time reduction ....especially for those who fly to get there .. still, no worries ...yet"

"We are going this weekend. We briefly considered canceling after hearing about 30+ cases in CA. But those seem to be connected to one of the cruise ships that were quarantined instead of transmitted normally. It doesn't seem like things are bad enough to cancel the trip. There are no reported cases in Nevada or Colorado (where I live) yet. I'm bringing alcohol wipes to wipe down buttons on machines and will also be using hand sanitizer frequently. We decided to not go to any buffets either and just eat at regular restaurants. This is just using an abundance of caution. It's probably a good idea regardless of Coronavirus since it's also still the regular flu season. We have other travel plans for later this Spring and I am worried that things will have progressed by then where we can't go, but hopefully not.Edited: 10:46 am, February 28, 2020 "
"""We decided to not go to any buffets either and just eat at regular restaurants.""Watch out for infected servers."
“ Watch out for infected servers.”Shouldn’t be an issue if the IT staff stays on top of the current updates.
"Yes, We're cancelling our trip to Las Vegas and stay at Luxor. The large amount of people in hotel, casino and general area seem too risky right now."
"We are headed there the 9th -13th for Con/Expo-Con?Agg. While concern about travel somewhat, I do believe we are not at a place where panic should set in. Safety precautions should be practiced as you always would when in close large crowds."
I just returned from Vegas. My advice is to wear a mask on plane to and from Vegas. I caught the flu on flight home. Wash hands frequently!

Did the person on the plane say he gave the flu to you ? Cause the flu doesn’t show symptom till 48-96hrs if not longer after you catch it. In theory you could have caught this anywhere even before you left for vegas.
"Nobody is wearing mask in the US, no need and don’t start it. If you wear a mask, everyone will think you are the sick one and they will look at you warily. You will be welcomed. Fear is a far more powerful virus than any germs, it can be transmitted within few seconds or an hour across 1000 miles without any close proximity, defies all logic and science. One person or the country can easily start a fear panic to control the masses, driving all into hysterical frenzy. Be careful what you say."
with resort fees parking fees now fees on liquor an virus that might or not be around might have to think hard before I go
“ now fees on liquor”I can deal with the possibility of a deadly virus. But fees on liquor!???! No way.
“ I can deal with the possibility of a deadly virus. But fees on liquor!???! No way.”Or parking???

">>Nobody is wearing mask in the US, no need and don’t start it. <<it's true that there's probably no need and most garden variety masks are ineffective in keeping germs out (although they are modestly effective at keeping germs in, if you're the infected one). what is not true is that nobody is wearing a mask in the US.i travel extensively, with six to seven trips to and through asia each year, often transiting in tokyo and hong kong. it used to be that the only place you would see face masks was narita airport in tokyo... and this goes back many years. now, i see them all the time at newark airport (new jersey) and la guardia airport (new york). i was in a broadway theatre today in new york city and two audience members (not sitting near each other) were wearing masks.people are indeed wearing them in the united states."

I just got back from Vegas 4 days ago as of right now it would appear nobody is worried...I was all up and down the strip at sooo many casinos so give me a week or 2 and I let you know how I feel...

"With so many other airborne viruses in Vegas, this is the one that makes Vegas vets cancel trips."
Change my plans? No.
"I gather this question is being asked from the perspective of ""would you travel to a destination where there are confirmed cases of the virus?"" And it's mostly being answered from the perspective of ""would the fear of catching it make me change my plans?""MAYBE the more interesting question would be: Would you be willing to cancel travel plans in order to minimize the spread of the virus?"
"We're going in two weeks, and I have no thoughts of canceling this or any other travel I have planned. If I get sick, I'll either get better or I won't. In my mind, I can get sick, hit by a car, my plane could crash, or I could have an aneurysm and be dead before I hit the ground. I will of course take precautions, like washing my hands and not touching my eyes and face. If I wasn't healthy with a healthy immune system I might feel differently, but probably not. Maybe this is why I love Vegas so much...I'm a gambler."
"Det tigerfan, this question was asked specifically at the location of Las Vegas, for the reasons being so many international visitors and so much close human interactions in all aspects from crowds, eating, and just plain touching things. People go to vegas for these activities. Most other cities are nowhere that intense."
"If there was a confirmed case in Vegas, we'd stay home. One would have to consider the health of others beyond themselves when making the decision to visit Vegas.This virus and it's epidemiology changes daily, plus there's a lot the CDC and state health agencies don't know about it to date despite good efforts and some common sense suggestions. One thing they do know is that a considerable number of confirmed case patients don't exhibit many symptoms; of course the elderly and other previously immune - compromised individuals are most susceptible. We'd just monitor the daily spread status (non-hysterically) to make Vegas travel decisions. In spite of all the hysteria that has occurred with this virus, this winter's general, multi-organism influenza impact in the US has been much more widespread and lethal than that associated with COVID-19...so far."
"I work in tourism here in Las Vegas. While no cases have been reported, I can tell you that Lots of people are canceling plans to visit. Many of those who are coming are avoiding shows, tourbus trips, and so on."
So what then is vegas doing to monitor these cases ? Are they having fever checkpoints in and out of airports ? I’m just curious. I’ve heard through friends living there that the mayor is taking things very seriously
"Absolutley agree with mandatory face masks on planes coughing and spluttering on a plane without covering your mouth is disgraceful the total lack of thought to orther passengers is horrible,i have been on flights where this happens and have been made ill many times. Cross Contamination on planes is everwhere on the plane,so yes Masks and Sanitiser MANDATORY.."
"dear new yorker, I have 5 'almost free' nights at The Sahara in Las Vegas 3/15 - 20. Using points+ I have to pay resort fees. American Airlines won't let me out of it. I am driving, and will bring rubber gloves, wet wipes and purrell. I won't gamble or touch money, casino chips. well, I might play a very little craps, gamble on basketball. I have an active caesars sports gambling app on my phone with only $45 in the account. I will sneak into the pools at Caesars and NY, NY, and might do the same at Mirage (however, that sneak method has flaws.) and, of course, there is the newly remodeled sahara and their 3 pools. I will do lots of grocery shopping (currently in weight watchers but that's another topic.) sort of afraid to ride the monorail. I could drive to caesars and park for free. I was able to do a complete cancel w/o fee at Casa Blanca in Mesquite, NV. That move totally kills the idea of attending the PAC-12 basketball tournament in the T-Mobile arena (last game ends 3/14.) So, I got jipped out of my Mexico vacation at christmas (another story), and really need to get out of town. what do you think ?"
It’s a nice stream of consciousness. But it could still use paragraphs.
"you much did it cost you to cancel ? I have a reservation at the sahara using american airline miles. it is 100% non-refundable (I lose the frequent flyer points.) On the back end of that, I have another 2 night reservation, also at sahara, also using american airline miles. this reservation can be cancelled, but I have to pay $150 to put the miles back in the account.my first 3 nights is 12,900 points; such a cheap point deal ! the next two nights are 16,800 points. There is no way I would pay $150 to preserve free points. There is no way that I would trim down my vacation from 5 nights to 3 nights. If anything, I would like to stretch my vacation, and have a cheap hotel in extreme sw utah allowing me to get to the pools in vegas earlier in the day on sunday, 3/15. I am driving from colorado."
"If there was a confirmed case in Vegasi'm going april 5-9, and i can pretty much guarantee there will be a known case well before that. just a matter of time. since i'm not elderly or immunocompromised, i'm not worried at all. if i have any type of illness on my departing or returning plane ride, i'll be courteous to my fellow passengers and wear a mask."
"The media exaggerates everything. I live in Portland Or, the news says its going to snow so be prepared for the worse. They say its going to maybe get a trace of snow in the higher elevations, by the time 8am rolls around the trace of snow has already melted. All this Coronavirus scare is nothing more than a really bad case of the flu., Most of the people in Washington State that died from it were in a senior living facility. They were old and there immune system was already down."
"well if you put your hands in your mouth after touching chips, money or slot machines then you probably already caught something lol. We're going in 2 weeks and it really only impacted those will current health issues. Just be aware of what you are doing, wash your hands regulary and avoid your mouth.

Yes. Vegas is a hub for the world. I can't afford to get it and be quarantined. I work in a major hospital plus my husband has a company to run. If I have a choice to go or not go....NOT!
"Very happy to report that my company cancelled our meeting in Las Vegas ONE day before we where supposed to go (today). We are a group of nearly 5,000 people planning to attend. Decision was based on employee safety and not contributing to the spread of the virus. Also, the first case of COVID-19 reported in Vegas days ago. Thankful I work for a company that puts our safety first, even at a great expense. Good luck everyone going, you should have plenty of room at the tables."
"“ Decision was based on employee safety and not contributing to the spread of the virus. ”No it wasn’t. It was based on their fear of liability if someone got sick and sued. I’m sure the email announcing the cancellation said it was all about the employees, though."

I'd like to think there some compensation or discounts based upon any limitations on the services, but it's their business plan.It hasn't caused Southwest to offer any flight discounts. We'll see what happens if the industry comes begging for the taxpayers to make up their losses."
"“ It hasn't caused Southwest to offer any flight discounts. ”Since you live in Hanover I guess you could walk to BWI lol. Southwest is charging $250 round trip for nonstop flights to Las Vegas next weekend. That’s dirt cheap, and typically would never be anything close to that for purchase less than a week before travel."
"Three days ago when I made the reservation, it was $571 each RT. You sir, have saved me $628 on a rebooking.Beannachtaí na Féile Pádraig dhuit!"
Expedia is 63.00 rt from CLT. I payed 175.00 last month. Prices are dirt cheap. Hotel and flight under 300.00
I THINK we are headed there Thursday for our annual trip downtown. I will be attending this long awaited vacation unless I myself get sick prior.
"Lisa D, will you post what it’s like there when you settle in? Supposed to come Sunday with some excited people who have never been. So bummed about all of this."
Absolutely. As long as I can still get there. Flying in from Alaska
"I live here. The strip closed all MGM buffets, shows, pools. There are several cases here not sure if 21 is exact number. I believe they are scanning at airport. Im Trying to stay up. Grocery stores are empty due to panic. No march madness or sports betting , except maybe at smaller casinos. Don't know for sure. Hope that helps. At least you are not planning cancun trip in May like us. Not sure we are going, staying informed.Edited: 6:03 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"This is not the Flu, its a virus. get a vaccine for it and it is another type of the flu. We have a vaccine for the flu and still every year millions of people get the flu and die from the flu. Get real, do the same thing you do for flu season, wash your hands, sanitize and drink plenty of alcohol while your in Vegas and you should be fine. If your worried about closures on shows and other events book in April or after and you should be ok. Lock in the lowest rates in years for flights and rooms and celebrate when you get there. I know I am."
Well MGM shunt down all Theyre o casinos.

Lisa D will arrive to a ghost town and perhaps a closed hotel.
"Alaska as yet only has just 1 confirmed case. Lisa D is doing her part to change that.Great job Lisa, you're not a horribly selfish person at all!"
"And lmichaels, what a way to experience Vegas for the first time! SO EXCITED! Great people all of you, always looking out for your fellow man."
