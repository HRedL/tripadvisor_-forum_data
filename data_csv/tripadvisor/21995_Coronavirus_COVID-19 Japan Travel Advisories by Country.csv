"""I find it interesting and a little disturbing that numbers for Japan are not included in Coronavirus Testing: ""Well they only have a few countries listed and it's not up to date, I did see some figures for Japan but can't recall the numbers, the UK is now over 16,000 with about 1,500 tests per day. There are a few reports about under testing in Japan, one interview was on the BBC. It's difficult to know what to believe at times. I hope they bring it under control soon."
"Just found this ""Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said that 6,300 tests were conducted from Feb. 18 to 24"""
