"Holiday booked 2-12 September but not sure if we should expect to be travelling at that time or not. I know it is still over 4 months away but we could still have a while until these lockdowns are lifted and even when they are lifted are most people going to want to be flying straightaway? I want to getaway, is due to be our first time in Cyprus but it all depends how quick these lockdowns will be lifted. Over here in the UK i don't think we all realised at first how serious this would be. Cyprus doesn't seem to be that effected but here in the UK we are going through the peak at the moment and think we will be in lockdown till end of May at least. Would be interested to know what others think, Is travelling first week of September likely or not?"
"I would wish it was because we're flying out the last day of September for a week.However I don't feel it's likely and have already accepted it. Even if Cyprus is all clear, I can't imagine them wanting other effected countries in.This is gonna be long"
"We're also due mid September I think it is 50/50, I read they may open airports there at the end of July for certain tourists depending what condition their country was is regarding number of cases. But boss of Gatwick now saying you just need to get a test 48 hours before and be negative. All the airlines and airports will be working together to agree a way forward."
"We always go at the end of September and had three holidays booked this year, two have already been cancelled. I am really not expecting to be able to visit Cyprus this year. If the Cypriot government will allow us in which is doubtful, as they are going to open up for the least affected countries first, I am not sure that the British government will allow us to travel abroad. In particular I don’t think anyone over 60 will be going very far. This is just my personal opinion and by no means fact."
Of course Cyprus is effected by covid 19. We have been living under very strict restrictions since middle of March. Complete curfew from 9pm every night and only allowed one trip outside the home...with government sms permission per day and heavy fines for violations. Our island depends on tourism but the Cypriot government has certainly put the safety of its people first. Let's all hope this difficult time is soon behind us all but safety and lives are the most important.
A month ago i thought it would be fine but the last week or so I think a lot of us have realised how serious it is so It feels like it is 50/50 to me also. If we cannot go then our back up option is to use the refund on Gran Canaria early November but even then it might not be an option. I just hope to get away somewhere at least otherwise Im in for a long year being an essential worker with no holiday at the end of it
https:/…I hope that you manage to get a holiday BD1991. I absolutely love my holidays but to be honest I would rather stay at home for the rest of this year.
"By then we will have 3 holidays cancelled and will be desperate to get there, a lot can happen in 5 months."
Absolutely no chance!I'm sorry but everyone needs to get real. Over 800 deaths today - none of us will be going anywhere this year.
"Sorry have to disagree 5 months is a long time off yet. All tourist resorts need this income once it is safe to travel they will be desperate for the tourists to come, government bail outs can't last all year."
"Ill admit I like a lot of others didn't expect it to be this bad at the beginning but I also agree that 5 months is a long time. Hopefully the worst of this will be over in a a few weeks but nobody knows, it could go on a lot longer than everyone thinks. I will just take it week by week, at least the weather is good here in the UK at the moment hopefully we can have a great summer too."
Due to fly out September 26. Kind of expecting not to go but still got the wee voice in the back of my head telling me it could still happen.
"“ All tourist resorts need this income once it is safe to travel “Yes, but even if the resorts reopen there is no guarantee our own government will allow us to be going abroad on holiday. They are talking about having to rearrange classrooms and offices for social distancing. How does that compute with 200 people sat crammed together into a flying tin can with recycled air for 4 hours? It doesn’t."
"We've written off 2020 tbh, I'd rather stay at home social distancing than having to bother with that whilst supposedly on holiday."
"That is also a good point Dave, you want to be able to relax on holiday. Im not sure that will be the case if there are so many restrictions in place. I would rather our holiday be cancelled then be able to go just a few weeks after it is clear to do so and have to deal with all the worry and restrictions."
"That is how I feel too. Imagine social distancing at airports and on planes. Also going in shifts to the dining room, pool etc. I don’t think that would be relaxing."
"I have given up on this year and maybe thinking of a staycation next year. You have only got to listen to the scientific advisors, they are saying no major lifting of lockdown until a treatment or vaccine is found. When asked when this will happen 12-18 months is the answer."
"I really do not think we will be going anywhere until there is a vaccine, its the only option I can see. Not just the holiday but as already said, being on the plane with all those people. I do not think we will be going away this year or the next, maybe the one after if goes according to plan"

As I have been informed the plan for flights is all airports get a rapid test detector for covid and all those tested negative will be allowed to fly.
Exactly that's all that is needed.
Was mentioned in this article a while ago.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-03-18-oxford-scientists-d…
Hi do you have any more information about this please or a link to where you read it? Thanks
Why do we assume that all we have to wait for is the UK government to say we can fly?If the country you are flying to won't allow UK citizens to visit then whether or not the UK government allows people to fly is an irrelevance.
Totally agree with Latimer. A lot of countries won’t allow tourists from the UK as we have a lot more cases. I read a story earlier saying Cyprus could start letting tourists in from certain counties but the UK and Russia will be bottom of the list.
"The query was about September which is still 5 months away, the UK only started the lockdown about a week later so we've still got plenty of time to catch up even without the innovation that might be used to test travellers before flying or even an antibody test. And it will work both ways then we won't let tourists into the UK either.Edited: 9:14 am, April 27, 2020 "
"Wafman - Er no. Catch up with what - are you not watching the news. It's not a competition.The UK's lockdown was several weeks after Spain, Italy, Germany, France and Cyprus - those countries were already in lockdown whilst the UK was running it's failed experiment on herd immunity and whilst folk like Dominic Cummings were saying that if a few old folk had to die to save the economy then it didn't matter.Tit for tat or however you want to phrase your last sentence won't apply - no matter how Great you may think Britain is.Firstly, do you seriously think that tourists will be clamoring to come to the worst effected country in Europe ?Secondly, we are currently allowing people into the UK freely and without health checks or quarantine requirements - madness. Thousands of people - approximately 150,000 -land at Heathrow every day and are amazed that they stroll through without health checks. It is UK government policy not to check people landing from flights - wherever those flights come from.Frankly, if I was a foreign country then I would let UK citizens into my country for a holiday and I wouldn't give a toss that my citizens were not allowed to holiday there.Careful if you want to play that game because we'll have even fewer European nurses by that point and still no one left to pick fruit.Edited: 11:22 am, April 27, 2020 "
Latimer Couldn’t agree more. We in the UK will be among the last people to be allowed to enter other countries & it’s hardly surprising since we have more Covid19 casualties than any other European country & more than any other country in the world bar the US.
"Totally agree with Latimer, in fact I have been saying for weeks that there will be no foreign holidays for anyone until at least Christmas.The problem is that people think that as soon as Boris says we can fly again that all countries are going to welcome British people with open arms whereas most countries will say ‘ no way Jose’.The Spanish have already hinted that there will be in foreign visitors until at least November and I can see most other countries doing the same."
Is the UK the worst affected country after the US though?I keep looking at the stats and it looks to me like Spain and Italy have more covidcases and deaths than the UK?https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Having said that the UK stats are economical with the truth re numbers and agree with Latimer that the UK gov has screwed up.
"What evidence do you have that the U.K. government has been economical with the truth regarding numbers as that's a big statement to make? Add France to your list too being more affected than the U.K.Edited: 3:46 pm, April 27, 2020 "
"For a start the UK omitted the deaths in Care Homes.BTW France included their care home figures in their death stats.Edited: 3:53 pm, April 27, 2020 "
Paulaf The UK Government has only released figures for people who passed away in hospital. As we know from other sources there have been hundreds of deaths in care homes & people have also died in their own houses but the government say they do have the figures so exclude them from their daily stats. The Office of Nation Statistics say deaths could be at least 50% higher than the governments figures.
"PaulafThe evidence is shown on UK television every night at around 5pm. The UK death numbers clearly state that they don't include deaths in the community or in care homes for England and Northern Ireland - apparently it's too difficult to do that, although Scotland, Wales and other European countries seem to manage it.Tuesday 28th April will see the latest figures released for care home and community deaths, however, they will still be 3 weeks out of date.The slide to watch for is the one that shows the trajectory of UK deaths (all settings) - it is slide 5 on today's pack.https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/gov…On that slide you can clearly see the UK (all settings) is ahead of Italy and France and just behind Spain ...... for now."
"So PaulafThe figures released this morning show deaths in the community and care homes are 35% higher than normal.This means that the figures released at the press conference at 5pm today (if the government is being honest) should reflect Covid 19 deaths at a much higher number than 21,092.What a tragedy and my heart goes out to those that have lost loved ones.Edited: 6:08 am, April 28, 2020 "

This article is quite interesting.https:/…
I think Brits should switch their holidays this year from Cyprus to Greece instead as it sounds like Greece will welcome all tourists according to the news.
Daughter has had her Greece holiday cancelled for July/August.So again nowhere guaranteed for travel.
"That seems very premature to be cancelled, didn't think any airlines had cancelled flights that far out yet.Edited: 11:20 am, April 28, 2020 "
"Twiggs and anyone else that is interested.I know that not all care home deaths are related to Covid 19, that is not what I said.The 35% increase in deaths in care homes and the wider community including homes, hospices, prisons figure has been quantified to state that just over 4,000 recorded deaths have Covid 19 on their death certificate - which means the UK total deaths is just over 25,000 and consequently it is now known to be the worst impacted country in Europe.Hope that is enough evidence to support my statements."
I was simply making a point Latimer.  I don’t intend to get into a political debate on a holiday forum.
I will delete my post 35 as it has no relevance as to whether we will get to Cyprus in September.
"Just on the question of numbers, the UK do have high numbers of Covid 19 deaths, but that has to be balanced against the fact that hospitals are instructed to put anything and everything down to the virus.If a patient once knew someone with a cough, the death goes down to Covid 19. Even people who have never been tested for the virus are having it on their death certificate.Back on topic - I reckon holidays to most locations will start by July, with some restrictions on hotel occupancy numbers and travellers perhaps needing a test before travel.Edited: 4:59 am, April 29, 2020 "
I certainly wouldn’t want to spend my holiday wearing a mask & distancing myself from other people. Even if there is a rapid test at the airport there’s no guarantee we won’t catch the virus while we are away which could result in a lengthy stay in a foreign hospital & not being allowed to travel back home until completely free of infection & would our insurance cover us for the virus while we were away? We usually go to Paphos every September but didn’t book this year due to upcoming surgery but if we had booked I would be hoping it would be cancelled so we could get a refund & think about going in 2021.
I agree Thomsgran. We have booked but I doubt that we will pay the final balance for the reasons that you have stated. I would rather lose the deposit than go through any of the things you mention. Hopefully it will be cancelled before the final balance is due.We booked three holidays for this year before Christmas! Two have already been cancelled.
"We rescheduled the Amavi from this year to May 2021 and our Athens trip from March to late October.Mauritius we changed from June to December but Krakow we have left for September.Dublin in July - we will wait and see. We can cancel the hotel without a problem, need for O'Leary to cancel the flight before we decide if that one goes ahead."
"Why lose your deposit, pay with your credit card and if the travel company doesn’t give you the money back then the cc company will"
"If you heard the press briefing tonight they said this :Elsewhere in Europe, there is no national tally for deaths in care homes in Italy, and in Spain it’s up to each region whether or not they include care homes in their count.So then with that in mind you can see the UK is not the worst country in Europe."
"We were due to be in Cyprus from last Saturday for a month. Contacted British Airways through a twitter DM a few days before we were due to fly (they had cancelled the flights about a month ago) and fair play had full refund into bank within a few days. We try to go every May and October for a month and not thinking we will be safe to return anytime soon. We are both 12 week shielding, my husband for a respiratory condition and me for an auto immune condition. Until this virus is eliminated, either by vaccine or because of natural immunity we will not feel confident being in proximity to anyone, and definitely not sat in a tin can with hundreds of others. If we were younger and fitter would probably feel differently much more confident of surviving if we were to contract it. As for which country is affected the worst, this is not a competition as to who can pee highest up the wall. Stay safe, stay healthy and please be kind and respect each others opinions"
"Interesting. The President (Cyprus) has announced that airports/ airlines will re open, gradually and under conditions. Same goes for catering, indoors and out, Hotels, Beaches ( ( using social distancing).. This from June 9th onwards."
Just on news from minister: First flights to open will be for Greece and then the wish will be for a common EU plan for flights.
"https:/…Some info here.Edited: 7:04 am, April 30, 2020 "
"Shame the UK will not be part of the common EU plan.Paulaf - even with documented evidence I am sure you will take comfort in whatever PR spin you choose to believe. Every PR and Spin stop will be pulled out to try and suggest that UK doesn't stay top of the list in Europe. It is top of the list ! Unless you look at deaths per million, where Belgium is top.Twiggs - this is not a political discussion it is a holiday forum and my posts are intended to advise and inform, supported by evidence. I make no secret of the fact that I disagree with the UK governments approach but that does not mean I am inviting political debate."
Message from the Presidenthttps:/…
Paul s You would only get your money back through your credit card company if the holiday was cancelled by the tour operator. If you cancelled yourself because you didn’t feel it was right/safe to go then you would lose most if not all of your money.
"I know that and that is why I won’t, or never would, be cancelling myself.I already know that the chances of going in July are about 0.00000000001% so I will wait until Jet2 cancel and then get my money back."
"There is some hope, airports to open late June:https:/…Edited: 10:32 am, April 30, 2020 "
"The apposite statement is not that airports will open BUT that they will open gradually and under conditionsEdited: 12:40 pm, April 30, 2020 "
"Interesting article here:""Every country has different ways of recording Covid-19 deaths: the large number of deaths in care homes have not featured in Spain’s statistics – which, like the UK’s require a positive test result. The numbers may be useful for looking at trends, but they are not reliable indicators for comparing the absolute levels. If we were naive enough to take the counts at face value, the new figures propelled the UK past France and Spain into second place in Europe behind Italy, which is not encouraging because we are behind Italy in terms of what stage of the epidemic we are at. A more equitable metric might be Covid-19 deaths per million. Ignoring tiny countries, our current score of 388 puts us third, behind Belgium (632) and Italy (452).""---------------------------https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/20…"
It's good news still about airports as there is a plan!!
"Booked for Protaras in July and had written off this years holiday .The ministers comments are very interesting .Edited: 3:35 pm, April 30, 2020 "
"Paul s Sorry if my post sounded condescending. You obviously knew about the drawbacks of cancelling before the company cancelled. Sadly some people don’t realise & lose a lot of money as a result. Hope you get to go,"
Latimer Thanks for posting the Presidents speech. Presumably things are looking up a bit in Cyprus but I think they are right to be cautious. He makes no mention of when hotels etc will be able to open but that’s understandable as they will need to see how their domestic plan works out first. I have my fingers crossed for them & hope all goes well.
"fingers crossed, hotels are on the 3rd stage (9/Jun)https:/…"
"Boss of Heathrow saying social distancing at airports is ' Impossible'...So presumably vthat goes for all UK airports..Edited: 5:57 am, May 01, 2020 "
That's right that's why everyone will have to be tested.
"Talking by email to the Cypriot owners of the villa we stay in at Coral Bay. In the nicest possible way, they really don't want UK travellers anywhere near their country for the forseeable future. Our owners, who have a small number of villas, are quite prepared to write off 2020 and see what the position is for 2021."
Boss of Heathrow clearly took legal advice
"@JoanDBathdo you suggest that UK travellers should be an exception? that they should be allowed to travel overseas freely? anytime?Edited: 12:19 pm, May 01, 2020 "
"Just read in the press that Cyprus will start allowing visitors from mainland Europe in July, but according to a Cypriot government minister no one from the UK will be allowed entry, make of that what you will"
"Fortunately its not upto 1 minister, it will probably be an Europe wide one and September is still a long time away for the UK situation to improve, Spain and Italy had terrible data 2 weeks ago."
"JoanDBath hope your villa owners and others with a similar view don't find Brits voting with their feet and going somewhere else this year where they are welcome, prefer it and don't bother returning to Cyprus."
"Have you offered to throw on the table a non refundable deposit, or is the villa owner expected to take all the risk in case travelling bans from countries still at peak are extended?"
"Paul S, yes I agree with your reply, I thought it was tinged with a tad of bitterness and as you say leave this forum for those of us who love Cyprus and are genuinely concerned about not getting our fix of this wonderful Island, the Cypriot people are absolutely right to be concerned about foreigners coming to their country and possibly triggering an outbreak worse than they have at present, Cyprus seems to have the virus under control and with a fraction of the deaths reported in the UK, my Cypriot friend from Emba informed me that all Cypriot people were being tested not just front line workers and over 65,s in care homes, the brexiteers now know how it feels to be the subject of xenophobia."
"I don't think that it will be a Europe wide decision as to when travel will resume. Countries were left to their own devices as to when & how to lockdown, close borders etc. I just can't see some countries accepting or allowing, decisions to be taken out of their hands as to when they ""open up"" again."
"Paul s having been going to Cyprus for 18 years I agree we love it and the people, I just think it's daft to pronounce now what countries will and won't be allowed in when we don't fully yet know what the situation will be when tourism resumes or even yet when the airports are open. They will be depriving their economy severely if they mess the Brits around that's all I'm saying, we want to return as usual this September."
"PaulafAs there are currently only 32 countries in the world with no reported cases of Covid 19, then good luck with finding somewhere to go if you do get the hump with Cyprus trying to protect their country against visitors from the worst affected country in Europe.And as for testing then the UK government changed the way tests were counted last Tuesday. Prior to that day tests were counted when completed and results processed; since Wednesday they’ve been counted when they were dispatched but not completed. For evidence please see the Health Service Journal (HSJ)As a consequence the UK hit a “target” that it should have been hitting 2 months ago.Currently you can only get a test if you displaying symptoms and are a key worker, in a care home or over 65 so good luck with getting a test to prove you are OK to fly abroad.I’m booked to go to Cyprus in July and September and Dubai in October - I have hope that we will be able to go but not blind faith.Edited: 8:11 pm, May 01, 2020 "
"To add on Latimer's postt , Cyprus is following S. Korea model for testing and goes testing after each positive's contacts so we are at top of tests per million and in fact 3 times as much as UK.As for Paulaf comment of hurting economy well yes we are willing to take the blow as we are a small country and 12 deaths of locals so far is too much for us in contrast of 700 a day for you and still have a holiday as a priority."
"Some people on here seem to think that the UK visitor being unable to enter Cyprus due to the virus will somehow cripple the Cypriot economy, aye right, the pizza, burger munching and the €1.50/pint brigade who descend on Paphos are really gonnae be missed, how patronising and condescending to The Cypriot people, the influx of Russian, Chinese, German, Italian and Scandinavian visitors will certainly offset the €10 a day budget tourist from the UK and won,t be missedEdited: 2:58 am, May 02, 2020 "
"#81, bit of a rude and sweeping statement to make. I spend around €100 a day when I go. I also travel around the island, and up into the mountains and so spend money in shops and restaurants etc that sone people wouldn’t even venture to. Cyprus won’t collapse without UK tourism but it will definitely have a negative effect. PS where are these €1.50 pints you speak of?Edited: 4:16 am, May 02, 2020 "
Derek K claiming someone is condescending while doing the exact same thing himself.
"Walk along Poseidon Avenue from the taxi rank to the Alexander the great hotel and you will get your €1.50 pint, I very seldom visit paphos these days and tend to spend most of my time in Kissonerga or Peyia, when I went into Paphos last Sept/Oct it cost more for a small coke than a beer, I apologise if I have upset you that is not my intention, I to like to go exploring the island during the day, been going to Cyprus for 20 years and still finding places of interest, all I am asking is for people to respect the wishes of the Cypriot people"
"The UK has twice as many visitors to Cyprus than any other country, at almost one and a half million a year and rising.I think its a bit much to generalise them all as £1.50 pizza/pint customers.Edited: 7:32 am, May 02, 2020 "
Just got e mail from jet 2 changing flight times for our booked September holiday in Paphos! We adore Cypriots and Cyprus holidays and have been returning to Paphos for at least 20 years.  However we are now in an extremely vulnerable age group with underlying health conditions and we cannot contemplate travelling anywhere until there is a virus vaccine so I’m wondering and rather worried about whether we shall lose our monies if holiday goes ahead.
"Northeastpopeye I agree, we spend a lot more than €10 a day, we give the Cypriot villa owner the 4 figure rent in cash, eat out in local restaurants for 14 nights and do lots of shopping in Paps so all our spend stays in Cyprus. The €10 per day is only applicable to people staying AI I would have thought."
"I hate it when these forums answers start being political. Do we think all countries Covid deaths counts are correct, most countries are suffering shortages of equipment. In England alone around 10,000 people die of Flu each year, even with a vaccine. How many Covid deaths are actually Flu. if no testing is done we don't know. The UK is behind with testing, Scotland is even worse than England on testing. Sorry but this is not a forum to vent political views. Stick to answering the questions. The answer to the original query is no one knows when we will be able to travel. We just have to wait and see. Don't give up on Paphos you will love it."
"We do the same Paulaf, villa, restaurants, hire car, supermarket shopping, 100 euro a day spends"
"per person expenditure is common knowledge, no value added by reporting this on the forum.https:/…"
It is an answer to a previous post if you care to read all of them
Royalscotposts aren’t political that is your perception. They contain fact.Quite simple really and you can judge that easilyIs Cyprus testing more people per head of population than the UK - yes or no ?Did the UK government change the way tests were calculated - yes or no?After Covid 19 was classified as a highly contagious infectious disease in January 2020 did the UK government downgrade Covid 19 to medium contagion in Mid March 2020 - yes or no ?These post are not political they are an attempt to explain to those that wonder whether or not they will be able to go on holiday as to why they may not be able to leave the UK for some considerable time.Several UK citizens still seem to labour under the misapprehension that every other country can’t manage without them and that everywhere else is somehow more risky than being at home.
"@NorthEastPopeyeyes I've read the 100E bill show off on a topic under title ""September holiday- will we get there?"" which, by the way, is min 1/3 the daily spend of tourists visiting London on holidays.In Cyprus 73E/day, is the average daily spend according to the government data and Apologies for the off topic.Edited: 6:51 pm, May 02, 2020 "
"Very good points raised by latimer from Liverpool, if Cypriots don,t feel safe with UK foreigners in their country we have to respect that decision without prejudice, Cyprus has had a total of 20 deaths with 800 reported cases of covid-19, the UK total is 28, 138 with nearly 200,000 cases of covid-19, as of 02/05/20, who do you think is handling this pandemic better, that is less than 1% of the UK total,"
"Derek, you have your figures wrong. UK has 414/ million deaths while Cyprus 12/million https:/…countriesThing you might not know is that in Cyprus casualties there are 3 Brits that came over and from 800 positive cases many again are students coming back from UK and quarantined for 14 days. It is not a case of fearing visitors from UK but just a case of negligence of people over there which is now costing lives. When we were locked inside with just one sms pass to get out we were seeing Liverpool vs Athletico in a packed Anfield, pubs and parks filled with people and your PM saying theories of herd immunity. I sincerely hope that this will end soon and all of us enjoy again our holidays. Today I would be writing this from a hotel in Lucerne but still locked home in Larnaca. Good thing from tommorrow we will be allowed 3 sms and swim as an exercise.Hope all of you out there are well and keep safe"
"Hello Cylib, you are saying my fugures are wrong, the figures I quoted are actual deaths due to the virus not the deaths per million as you quoted,both are correct"
Cyprus has 15 dead. 12 locals
Figures I gave are official ones for ROC but maybe there are a few more in turkish occupied north.
"Post 86 Coastal260...If the changes to your flight times were substantial (e.g. changed from a day time departure / arrival to a night time) then that should be grounds for you to cancel the holiday and you should get a refund.Obviously, at the moment Jet2 will be resisting making refunds so you will need to be tenacious in your argument.Some information here about this:https:/…"
Latimer I still think you are not answering the original question. The best bet is to follow the FCO travel advice which also gives information on the situation in Cyprus.. Figures and information change daily. You can also put an alert on the FCO website and they will e mail you any changes to the current restrictions in Cyprus.
"The FCO can tell us it,s safe to travel, Cyprus on the other can deny entry to foreigners they think pose a risk to their citizens"
"I already answered the first question back on page 1 and 2 of this topic.My answers are not just to the first question but for clarity the first question also asked for people’s opinions.And I absolutely understand your point about FCO advice, which will tell those from the UK when it deems it is safe to travel to other countries.BUT once again makes the assumption that all we are waiting for is the UK government to deem it is safe to travel to Cyprus.I maintain that FCO advice is irrelevant if the Cypriot government does not think it is safe to allow those from the UK into Cyprus.And I agree wholeheartedly with Cylib. On the day Cyprus went into full lockdown with a text message required to be allowed out the country had had 2 or 3 deaths.That same week in the UK we allowed 3,000 citizens from the worst impacted capital city in Europe into Liverpool, which is one of the reasons there has been a spike in cases and deaths in the North West that you see on the government slides. We also allowed 250,000 people to go to Cheltenham Festival."
The FCO also has a page which states the restrictions that Cyprus have for travel from other countries and restrictions they have in force in country. You can get email updates of any changes to his information. Very handy for people wanting updates as to when they can visit Cyprus.
"I'm sure Simon Calder travel expert just said on ITV he was optimistic flights would resume at the end of June, wonder why he thinks that, any inside knowledge or just wishful thinking?"
"I would not pay any heed to Simon Calder. When this was all happening he was on BBC saying this was a good time to travel, a week or so later, UK Gov was trying to get a load of repatriation flights organised for Brits stuck abroad! Anyone could see this virus was serious.I really do not think anyone is going to be travelling abroad in June!"
"I agree with Jane C, jet2 say they will start flying on the 17th June,all this is dependant on how other countries view the situation in the UK, the only reason that the virus is in decline at the moment is because of the current lock down guidelines, to relax these measures only increases the chances of a second wave, we are booked for September and I am not 100% convinced that this will happen, I would like to be totally wrong"
"Simon Calder is effectively paid by the travel business. No travel, no holidays = no job for Mr Calder.I would treat everything he says about flights restarting in June with a serious dose of realism."

I also going to Cyprus first week in September I'm a tad worried as I'm classed by NHS as a venerable person I've been on lockdon for 7 weeks I don't want to.go away and get covid19 surley our government Won't alow us to fly Cyprus Never-ending the Cyprus government wanting uk citizens there with our death rate ...
"Hi All, OP here , didn't expect such a big debate! Has been an interesting read. I am still not sure if we will be able to fly in 4 months, I think it will be more of a case if Cyprus will allow us in. I want to have a holiday this year like we all do but health is more important so if we have to wait until next year then so be it, in my head now I am not expecting to be able to fly."
I'm going to Cyprus from Ireland the first week of September for a month as part of an artists residency and I'm pretty optimistic that my trip will go ahead.
"114. BD1991 Hits the nail on the head for me, stay safe folks."
"I'm pretty optimistic my 2 weeks in September will go ahead too, lot can change/improve in 4 months time, we've only been in lockdown for 7 weeks even though it feels a lot longer."
"A promising update from The Sun<<...Cyprus issued similar sentiments for a June opening for Brits despite initial fears that other countries would take precedence - Cypriot deputy tourism minister Savvas Perdios told Sun Online Travel: ""We love taking care of the British people.""There are a lot of British people living here. Whenever others are ready to visit our island we will welcome them with open arms.""...>>https:/…"
"Sinnayis, I wouldn’t believe a word that it printed by that rag as 99% of the stuff they print is fabricated news"
"""Whenever others are ready to visit our island we will welcome them with open arms""Sorry but to me, Ready, is the crucial word in that statement as it could mean a number of things. I don't really see it as statement that indicates an imminent return for UK travellers because I don't think the politician means.. when the UK tourists feel they are ready to travel. Imo, he means when the Cypriot authorities are ready to let them enter Cyprus."
The hotel that we've been going to in Cyprus has sent a couple of email circulars and the gist of them is that they cannot wait to get back to welcoming guests - from wherever.They are really struggling financially (as is the UK economy) and there is a tremendous will to get business of all sorts started - including the holiday business.Restrictions will start to be lifted here in the UK on Sunday. An awful lot has happened in 7 weeks. September is over 16 weeks away.People will be going on holiday in September - probably much sooner than that.
"I'm sure that some UK tourists feel 'ready' to travel to Cyprus now. Ready is a strange word to use. I had a phone call from Jet2 yesterday as we were due to fly out to Cyprus in 4 weeks. They sent me an email in early April advising that my holiday on 3 June wouldn't be going ahead and I'd already filled in the change from requesting to change the holiday to 17 June which is when Jet2 are planning to resume flights. However as time goes by it is pretty evident to me that they won't resume flying then and I'd already had a discussion with my partner about changing the holiday to September and Diane from Jet2 was more than happy to change the departure date to mid September. Whether the holiday goes ahead remains to be seen and whilst I am prepared for it to be cancelled, like many of you I am really hoping that things will have improved by September and our holidays will go ahead."
"‘A lot has happened in seven weeks’ yes, & all of it bad. If restrictions are lifted by too much in the UK next week we will be in for a huge upsurge in cases & we will have no choice but to lock down again perhaps more tightly than now. There are so many factors to take into account when thinking of going away this year. Will the UK government let us? Will the Cyprus Government want us? Will our airlines be flying? Will hotels be able to function operating social distancing at buffets & in swimming pools? Lastly will we want to go to airports, sit on crowded planes & wear masks outdoors all the time?"
"Thomsgran ,I totally agree with you way too many ifs and buts what sort of holiday would it be even if you got there certainly not a relaxing one with all the restriction involved, and that is after the stress of the airport and the flight !!I think this year can be discounted although it would be amazing if I wrong ."
I agree with Thomsgran Forget holidays this year Have a staycation next year and look forward to 2022
What happens if we're allowed to travel by all countries and airlines are running but must follow social distancing rules when there..? Surely we will have to go or be prepared to lose potentially thousands of pounds as the travel company have not cancelled it?
"Decent point to make Balile Who knows what is going on behind the scene with Governments,Tourist boards,Airlines,Hotels etc.If things don’t pick up June ,July,there may be no airlines left in business for next year !Edited: 12:41 pm, May 07, 2020 "
"I’ve just read a thread on another forum listing the precautions Rui & Palladium hotels will be taking at their properties & it doesn’t fill be with an urge to travel anytime soon. Gloves handed out at buffets, limited number of people in pools & bars & restaurants at one time & loungers 2 metres apart which means they will have to remove a lot of the loungers around the pools. Coffee makers removed from rooms, perspex screens at reception & staff wearing face masks. I’m not saying this will necessarily be the case in Cyprus but it won’t be much different imo."
"Probably this will be the case globally, for all our every day activities, not only travel and holidays; at least until a vaccine is prepared and tested.Edited: 1:17 am, May 09, 2020 "
Cyprus have been in total lockdown for weeks now. They are starting to lift things slightly and places are starting toOpen up again slowly. Hotels etc aren’t opening just yet though. Keeping fingers crossed for everyone who has plans to go this year as it’s a beautiful country with such amazingly friendly people. Stay safe.
If the reported 14 day quarantine on people coming to the UK comes into force then that is going to affect a lot of holidays.
That idiot Shapps who is the transport secretary should have made the 14 day quarantine about 2 months back instead of locking the door after the horse has bolted !He was the same clown who let a profitable airline go under - the guy is clueless.
"I agree with Ian C, people arriving in the UK should have been quarantined months ago, better still only UK nationals should have been allowed entry, this could have speeded up a relaxation of the lockdown but I am still confident travel to Cyprus might be allowed end of June/beginning of July, hotels could be an issue though, people staying at villas and apartments could be ok if they provide an address on entry"
"Sorry but I cant see any chance at all of UK residents being able to travel anywhere this year. For a start there will be no insurance cover for Covid 19 for almost all of us and if there were a second wave whilst we were abroad that could be a hugely expensive scenario. There is also no way aircraft or airports can safely convey passengers at this time. Even if they could get us to our destination I have to wonder which country would want UK citizens arriving given we have the highest death rate in Europe.Edited: 5:27 pm, May 09, 2020 "
I was met by health officials at Dublin Airport on my return from Iceland in mid March and told I had to quarantine for 2 weeks which I did. Truly unbelievable that UK is only doing this now.
"Seriously, if anyone thinks they'll be travelling abroad this year and enjoying a relaxing holiday then they are living in cloud cuckoo land. Next year will be pushing it."
"Its anyone's guess really and a 2nd / 3rd phase could be worse than what we have already experienced but then this could all just disappear in the next 3 x months. The cautious part of me says no flying until after end of Feb / Early March next year but the other part of me says airlines need to get planes in the air, the economy needs to pick up and 16 weeks until the 1st week in Sept is a hell of a long time so who knows.I'm due in Paphos 6th Sept for two weeks and I'm torn over wanting to go or not but as I said. Who knows how the next 4 x weeks is going to pan out never mind 16 x weeks."
https:/…Another interesting article.
"Just had a text message from a friend who lives in Emba, only one new case reported yesterday, he says they are hopeful of welcoming UK visitors from the middle of August to beginning of September"
Unless we introduce the 14 day quarantine no-one will want to travel then.
"Will people want to take the risk of travelling? Wearing a face mask for the duration of the flight doesn't sound very comfortable.Also what about the cleaning regime between guests at your accommodation. Can they deep clean rooms in a few hours. Some hotels might be ok but what about private rentals who will ensure cleaning standards are met and rooms are infection free?We always rent apartments and not had any issues normally, apart from one apartment which was poorly cleaned but that was in different times.A particular worry would be accommodation with a high turnover rate for eg we stayed in an apartment last year and the apartment above us was having new guests every few days some people we only saw for 1 day and they were gone."
"Hello, What is the latest thoughts for everyone? The number of deaths here in the UK are decreasing each day, more optimistic we will make our September holiday"
If you can holiday and afford the two weeks quarantine in top then you’re in with a chance
"We are not to know if we will have to quarantine yet it is too early to tell. If we can fly but are told we will have to quarantine on return then we might aswell go. Ill only losing the £1000pp spent if we are able to fly and decide not to.Edited: 5:41 pm, May 19, 2020 "
"Why quarantine on return, Cyprus has reported less than 20 deaths, the chances of getting infected are more likely to happen in the UK or on the outbound flight, on a brighter note the cafe/restaurant Neromylos in Steni village has said it will be opening on the 7th June, so I am assuming the lockdown measures in Cyprus are easing off, I would like to know if there are other places preparing to reopen soonEdited: 2:08 am, May 20, 2020 "
"I didn't realise Cyprus had so few deaths, i knew it was low but that is nothing compared to other countries. We are not due to fly for another 15 weeks which is a long time, unless another outbreak happens during that time I think we will be fine."
"BD, Cyprus has 17 deaths which is so much lower than the UK even when you take into consideration the huge difference in population. Unfortunately quarantine on return isn't an option for a lot of people who have to go straight back to work so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that won't be happening by September. If we were going to introduce quarantine it should have happened months ago IMHO when flights were still arriving from all over the world."
"UK will not quarantine visitors from Cyprus as is deemed safe.Of 17 deaths 3 were Brittish. Only 3 hospitalized at momentOn May 21 all restaurants/pubs/ cafes will open serving outdoor seating. Clubs and all indoor entertainment will remain closed.My guess is that by late July all tourists will be allowed in provided they have a negative Cov19 test before boarding.Today government officials will discuss this issue with health expert advisorsGoogle translate this reporter.com.cy/politics/article/680464/epi-…Edited: 4:29 am, May 20, 2020 "
"That all sounds good except for having a test before flying, no chance in the UK as there's not enough tests for all would be travellers."
In Cyprus clinics ask from those who will undertake an operation a test which private labs carry out for 80€
"Good point Robert, how do you get a test in the UK if you are not a frontline/key worker,"
Superdrug apparently.......https:/…coronavirus-antibody-test-kits.html
"Flights start on June 15. They will start from Greece, Malta, Israel, Austria and Lebanon and it will be free entry without quarantine."
"That’s good we will get to hear how it goes for those countries and how Cyprus will deal with any cases that crop up , if any ."
Can you actually have a Covid test before boarding? I understood the tests had to be sent to a laboratory & take at least several days to come back by which time you could have caught it ! The pin prick tests that tests if you have antibodies & have probably had the virus also have to be sent to a lab & there’s no talk of this being provided on the NHS. Superdrug charge £69 but you have to post it off for analysis.
24 hours
"The Superdrug test has already been discredited by many and costs money - you could catch the virus between doing an antibody test and catching a planeDerek - anyone over the age of 5 can get a test in the UK now but only if you have symptoms so the short answer is get sick, get a test.And the UK government are trumpeting the number of daily tests are increasing every day - apparently that’s because they have started counting one test as two tests because both your nose and mouth are swabbed.But hey, if you keep missing your own targets then a lie will get you there for sure."
"By what we hear seems UK visitors will come over before September. July will see first numbers from ""safer"" countries and then it will be for countries bringing their PO index to below 1.Official announcements later today"
Let's hope they drop the requirement for a test 24 hours before like Greece did and just have a list of countries. The R for the UK is below 1 now.

"Ah dont see the UK or Ireland mentioned there. Guess Cyprus have enough countries able to visit them this year they don't need to risk getting the deseased Brits this year.Don't see France, Italy or Spain either"

KMcN5. I think that bit refers to Cypriot nationals coming from anywhere other than those places listed.
Cheers twigs.
https:/…This is the current situation with beaches opening.
"You've got no soddin chance! Just be told. The Cypriots dont want uk travellers until there is a vaccine.Edited: 4:42 pm, May 24, 2020 "
JoanDBath actually what Cypriots may or may not want is hardly relevant. https:/…
JoanDBath... what Cyprus doesn't want is covid19. The Cypriot government is looking after its citizens. The Cypriots have lived under very strict restrictions since March and its government is still projecting them. Saturday no new cases of the virus reported...Sunday 8 new cases 7 of which came from the UK on a repatriation flight....need any more be said?
An interesting article about hotels opening and tourism in general.https:/…
"If Cypriot people are (rightly) afraid of UK citizens (or any other citizens) bringing the Covid virus to their island, then surely the answer is to insist on testing before arrival.If people have a test to say that they haven't got the virus, or the anti-body test to say that they have had it but have now built up immunity, then surely they would be safe to travel.That's the way I see things going and in the not too distant future. So yes, a September holiday will almost certainly go ahead.Edited: 4:46 am, May 26, 2020 "
"There was a report in the Times the other day about a test with results in under an hour and with no lab needed , .being rolled out . I wonder if eventually the airlines will test people at or before the airport with their passport so no one can cheat . The cost would have to be borne by the passengers, but a small price to pay if you can be sure no one has it when they fly . We will just have to find ways to adapt to new circumstances as man has always done I guess ."
We fly out on the last day of september too from liverpool fingers crossed this will happen good luck to us all xx
"I think September will be fine for us, its just going to be a case of what restrictions will be in place by then."
"The whole concept of negotiated ""air bridges"" is beyond my ken.You either have control of the virus in your country or you don't.The UK doesn't have control, and even less since the weekends big news story. The government is lying and cheating its way to arbitrary and randomly picked self imposed targets that it keeps singularly failing to hit. Let's count a pair of gloves as 2 items of PPE, let's count tests in the post as completed tests and their latest wheeze is to count a swab test of the nose and throat as two tests rather than one - watch those test numbers hit 200,000 by hook or by crook as Boris promised.How are British people going to be able to have a test certificate to prove they are virus free within 72 hours of a flight if it takes on average 72 hours to get results back ?Then there is the current minor stumbling block of not being able to get a test unless you have symptoms so you wouldn't be allowed to fly anyway - or maybe you would if you could prove you wanted to test your eyesight !We have no functioning track and trace mechanism, our ""world beating app"", which was promised for 1st June isn't working and there is no new date for it to work. Other countries are putting us to shame - mostly those countries that we usually look down our superior British noses at.I truly hope that everyone gets the opportunity to go on the holiday they want to go on and stays safe when they do so. The husband of a friend of mine has just come out of hospital after 63 days, most of which was spent on a ventilator in ICU and when his family was unable to visit - getting by on the one daily phone call to confirm whether or not he was still alive. He is normally fit and well, doesn't know where he caught it and whilst he has been discharged from hospital, he is not yet home. He has gone to a rehab centre where he will learn to walk again and try to replace some of the 2.5 stone he has lost. His lungs are permanently damaged as are his kidneys.Holiday at your own risk"
Excellent post
"Yes, the testing has to be a whole lot slicker than at present.We're going to need to walk into a chemist for a test and be guaranteed the result the next day."
Latimer. I couldn’t agree more. We are a long way off dealing with this & we can’t trust our government to tell us the truth. Lockdown is being lifted too early & schools going back too soon. I hope I am wrong but I can see cases going up in June & July. I would love to be in Paphos in September under normal circumstances but things are far from normal there or here so I will sit tight & hope I can go under better circumstances next September.
"Hi all, What is the latest with everyone in terms of thoughts on September being a reality? The signs have been good recently in terms of cases and deaths reducing a lot however I wouldn’t be surprised if these were to increase again between now and September due to all these gatherings and protests recently. I am just hoping i can have an answer from Ryanair early July to at least get an update with our flights."
"I would say no, just my opinion. What would you do about insurance, what if you developed it over there/airport, etc? What about hospital care with no insurance?"
"The fact that New Zealand has 2 new cases, both from the UK, will have alarmed most countries that care about their own."
Cyprus have already said that if you did catch covid in Cyprus then they will move you to a hotel that's being used as a hospital which will be paid for by them.https:/…
"We reluctantly last evening decided to cancel our Sept trip and wait until April 2021, hoping Covid will not be around then. It is a bit too risky for our age group so a very sad decision."
Cyprus may pay for our care but possibly being on a ventilator for a month or more in another country would not be my idea of fun. Accommodation for anyone travelling with you would have to be paid for plus a new flight home which could be very expensive. I am in no rush to go anywhere until we can see our families back home.
"RachdodoNote that a country that is free of the virus can legitimately promise to pay for your hospital trip IF you catch Covid whilst you are there.Not sure they’d pay for it if you were found to have it when you got there.And as I keep stressing IF you choose to travel whilst the FCO none essential travel advice is in place you would invalidate your insurance policy in its entirety - so that means zero cover for anything i.e. theft, death and repatriation, any medical condition, accident or illness whatever the cause.Whilst Cyprus might give you free medical treatment for Covid caught in Cyprus, it won’t for any other condition."

"Cyprus is so keen to get its tourism industry back on track, officials are offering to cover the costs of any travelers who test positive for Covid-19 while on vacation in the Mediterranean island nation.According to a letter shared with CNN, the Cypriot government will pay for lodging, as well as food, drink and medication for tourists who are taken ill with coronavirus during their visit.“The traveler will only need to bear the cost of their airport transfer and repatriation flight, in collaboration with their agent and/or airline,” states the letter. The news came shortly after Cyprus Transport Minister Yiannis Karousos announced hotels in the country will reopen on June 1, while international air travel will restart on June 9.Once the destination reopens, visitors from only chosen countries will be allowed to enter. The country lists are divided into 2 categories, A & B.Edited: 8:11 am, June 19, 2020 "

We are booked through Tui from Manchester to Paphos Sun 6th Sept to Sun 20th Sept and i'm really hopeful we are going to get there but alot can happen in 69 days so who knows. Tui have just changed our plane as on the original booking when selecting our seats it was a 737-800 layout but they've just changed the plane to their Dreamliner over the weekend.Might be worth others who booked with Tui checking if you've already booked seats on the 737-800 plan as the seating configuration on the dreamliner is a lot different and we had extra leg room seats booked but when they swapped the plane over the seats we were booked into were just normal seats. Amended now but could cause problems if you didn't know they swapped to the dreamliner.

"got a holiday booked for 3 weeks from Thursday august 13th, booked as a package through travel republic. Providing cypro reopens to brits on the 1st i will still go. Im based in london so can get a test done for £199 at harley street on tuesday the 11th that will come with a pdf of result within 24hrs and for an extra 50 quid they will provide me a medical certificate declaring im covid free. Not ideal but if i cancel i will be out of pocket 400 quid on flights and another 40 quid cancellation fee. Could do without the hassle tbh but between a rock and a hard place. Set up my flight pass application just need to apply within 24hours of my departure. let see.."
52 days until we are due to fly now (yes I am counting/hoping). Am i right to think that at the moment as it stands early September should be no problem? Of course i am realistic and know that a lot can change in the next month or so but really hoping we can have this holiday this year. Both me and my girlfriend have been working non stop throughout this since March so could really do with a break!
Hi am due to go on the 13th September as it stands at the moment if you have been in the uk 14 days before your travel date your not allowed in...... this will be continued to be looked at it could still change
As it stands today your not allowed in if you have been in the uk 14 days before you go! Am going 13 September but it does say they will be looking at this again in a few weeks
"Received an email from our holiday company yesterday, saying that our holiday leaving the 16th of September will go ahead.There is just the problems of a virus test and Cyprus Flight Pass to overcome !!"

"Hello all, 6 weeks until we hopefully travel now. What is the latest with Cyprus? Any links or info? Thanks"
"Plenty threads regarding what's happening presently,maybe read them,UK Cat C."
"Flights cancelled until mid August, we are due to fly 2nd September!? In the back of our minds we thought we had a chance but this doesn't look good now, i just hope that if we do have to reschedule for next year that we can do without much hassle!"
"We’ve just had our October flights cancelled by BA so not looking good for the autumn I fear , we will not bother to rebook for this year most likely . The return flight is not yet cancelled but expect it will be ."
I think BA are just moving their flights from Gatwick to Heathrow so you can accept this change if you still want to go.
"Yes I thought that could be the reason, they didn’t give one , but I think I’ll hang on and see what happens with everything before I decide what to do The other option Is vouchers to use before April 2022 which hopefully we would be able to use ."
If you don't want vouchers call and ask for a refund I've had 3 flights cancelled so far and had full refunds for all within days by BA.
"Thanks for that , I’ll bear that in mind . As you say a refund is the best option really and I don’t like flying from Heathrow at all"
Not sure if you're still on track for your holiday....I guess it might depend who you're flying with? My flight is with TUI 20th Sep but no decision from them yet. My accomodation is with Villa Plus and they're demanding final payment despite the flight situation being hazy at best!
We were due to fly 29 September. Flights with Jet2. Booked the Avanti hotel separately. Just had an email confirming the hotel won't be opening this year. Whilst very disappointing its understandable in the circumstances.
"Hi, We are flying with Ryanair and not heard anything yet. When we booked early February we paid for it all straight away. 4 weeks today we are due to fly but we are not expecting to, it feels as though Cyprus are doing everything not to let us in."
Booked to go with TUI on 23rd September but we will change our destination if we are still Category B as it doesn't make sense based on current infection rates between the UK and Germany for example. I don't think TUI will operate holidays to Cyprus unless the UK is deemed as Category A.
"I haven't had a chance to fact check but read that Ireland have today put Cyprus in their category requiring quarantine on arrival in Ireland.it a very fluid situation, anything could happen in a day!"
"I agree, all their responses do hint at that. Just wish they'd make an early decision.... considering their season effectively ends at the end of October it can hardly be worth all the hassle?"
"We are also unsure that if our holiday is cancelled then whether or not we should book a different location abroad or just stick with the UK. As we booked this holiday before all of this madness back in February, we feel and are hoping we will not lose much if any in terms of money. Our holiday is ATOL protected so hopefully we are covered. I wouldn't mind having to delay our holiday until next year as long as it doesn't cost us much extra to do so."
Looking at the TUI website the earliest booking that cam be made is 15th August so I expect a decision early next week. My view is they will cancel all holidays to Cyprus this year. I can't see Cyprus changing their view on Category B for the UK.
"Just seen this on twitter:@CyprusMFA to make you aware after the Cyprus gov announced last week that NHS tests would be accepted, we were taken off the plane today, taken to a separate area and everyone with a NHS test had to pay €60 euros for another test. Lying to tourists"
does anyone know when the next review date for the UK Category is?
"‘ to make you aware after the Cyprus gov announced last week that NHS tests would be accepted, we were taken off the plane today, taken to a separate area and everyone with a NHS test had to pay €60 euros for another test. Lying to tourists ‘ See I cannot be bothered with the above, just make it clear for everyone. If you want to stop us from entering then fine let us know but if we are allowed to enter make it clear what will be required when we land! I am hoping the next few weeks there are not a rise in cases and we can just be put in category A but we shall see."
"Oh my goodness!That's not what we've all been told by multiple sources, no wonder the airlines are fidgety. The next thing will be them being responsible for ensuring passengers have correct Covid documents before boarding!"
Just checked out @UKinCyprus Twitter feed and they're definitely saying that the NHS test with all relevant evidence of timing of the test etc is fine. If anyone arrived before 1st August there would have been a problem. There are positive experiences being posted too so I'm a bit confused.com!
That's not great....thank you for the info. I'm not sure if we'll even get there with TUI!

Was that at Larnaca or Paphos?
"That is true JLM, if we are allowed to fly we will triple check we have everything required. It has been over 3 months since I started this thread, been a long 3 months, hopefully in a week or 2 we will know for sure if we will get there or not"
"We emailed the Cyprus Flightpass helpdesk. Response as follows. You need to upload the appointment letter which must clearly show, full name and date and time of the test, together with a negative result. These two bits of info need to be in one pdf document. The time of the test must be no more than 72 hours before your scheduled flight time. Children under the age of 12 do not require a test."
"Lets say TUI start holidays to Cyprus with the UK as Category B so a negative test certificate is required. Using the NHS service for travel is not an option for me as NHS testing isn't ethical for travel certificates. Therefore, does anyone know what the other options are or will TUI provide details of private testing services near where you live?"
No.240 sorry here is the link to the post I seen on Twitter https:/…1290707439394971649
"My view and the view of the NHS is that NHS tests are NOT available for travel certificates https:/…TreatI believe this is why Jet2, TUI etc... are not going to Cyprus until the UK is category A."
"True, a certificate is required for all countries listed at category B.So the authorities announced an adjustment to exceptionally assist the UK passengersMinister of Transport on 31/07 confirmed to the British High Commission in Nicosiahttps:/…1289172033780187136Flightpass portal yesterday was updated accordinglyhttps://cyprusflightpass.gov.cy/en/faqsEdited: 3:18 pm, August 05, 2020 "
"I have been researching private testing clinics near me by carrying out a search on google. Sadly, only one private doctor surgery local to me offered the service at £250 with no guarantee of results arriving within 72 hours and their lab not open at weekends. You have to have the result before submitting the Cyprus Flightpass form which needs to be uploaded no more than 24 hours before departure. This added time pressure could mean you only have 60 hours in which to get tested and receive results. The cheapest place I found was in London at £199 but the train fare for me is £25. So, bottom line, private clinics can vary in cost between £150 (found some clinics but in the North of England, so not good for me) and £289 (London, same day results) which for a family of four is excessive. TUI and Jet2 still putting pressure on Cyprus to place UK into category A. Incidentally, I had friends arrive into Larnaca on Sunday and they were not retested on arrival but they did notice random checks being carried out."
"At post 245 - I'm going to repeat what I said earlier and frankly I think you should delete that tweet and other posts containing it.The inference from the tweet is that NHS tests are not acceptable when clearly they are.There is nothing in that inflamatory tweet to suggest otherwise just an massive assumption made by the tweeter. You have no idea if the test they took was correctly documented or not.Firstly one assumes he's writing that tweet from a holiday in Cyprus and not from a quarantine bunker so the holiday has gone ahead.It gives no reason for the test was or where the flight was from ? I bet the answers to both questions are relatively minor worries.He says ""we"" does that mean the entire plane or just him and his family ?Could it be some of the random testing they are doing ?In which case absolutely nothing to do with the NHS test at all, more than likely him and his party were one of the randomly selected tests that were mentioned last week and frankly better to have more testing rather than less.I'd move on as there's nothing to see here - that tweet is just some wound up ""why me"", self absorbed numpty, hacked off at being charged 60 euros for something he thought he'd got for free by using the NHS testing service inappropriately.Until there is official confirmation that NHS tests are not acceptable and people are being ""taken off planes"" (which in itself is inflamatory as one assumes he was off the plane anyway and in the arrivals hall) then there really is nothing to be gained from sharing such an incendiary tweet. People are stressed enough as it is."
Re - 249Here in the uk the NHS is not a service available to provide people with a test to enable travel. Nobody should be abusing the services of the NHS at this time. To be honest for people to be sending Tweets about 'their NHS test certificate' is embarrassing for them.If in doubt read this from the NHS Website --https:/…TreatThis is why JET2 and TUI will not resume services to Cyprus unless the UK is considered Category A.

"I suppose all we can really do is hope things are fine the next 3 weeks with very little cases so we go into category A and travel with no hassle, would make it a lot easier. Will keep checking daily to see what happens over the next few weeks."

"Now we don't only have to worry if Cyprus will let us in will have to worry if UK will let us visit .Cyprus R number worse than uk 1.6 - 2Edited: 11:52 am, August 06, 2020 "
Just found out our holiday with jet2 holidays flying out 21 September has just been cancelled because of covid 19.gutted
"So sorry to hear that! I bet our 7th October one with Tui will be too! October is usually the end of season.Edited: 12:31 pm, August 06, 2020 "
"Reply to LindaB. Yes, saw that in the Cyprus Mail. Their ‘R’ rate far higher than the UK. I am pleased that the UK is not being blamed for the increase in numbers. Sadly, many of the people testing positive, according to CM, are arriving on boats into Limassol or Cypriot residents returning home from other countries, including UK. Being a national means they are not required to have a negative covid test prior to boarding. Last Sunday, it was reported in the daily paper that a Cypriot lady arrived from Heathrow and after being selected for random testing in Larnaca was found to be positive. Bottom line, if we are able to travel to Cyprus please ensure all precautions are taken on board your flight. You may well be travelling with people who have not been tested.Edited: 12:40 pm, August 06, 2020 "
The R rate is higher in Cyprus than the UK (between 1.6 and 2). Anyone considering travelling to Cyprus should be prepared for possible quarantine when they get back. It could be introduced at short notice while you are away.
"I read that but also read the number of new cases today was only 13, so the UK quarantine rules look at active cases over the last 14 days as a percentage of the population, so I don't think there's any worry yet."
"Paula The UK have just put the Bahamas on the quarantine list due to a spike in cases so it’s worth being aware.https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-wales…Edited: 3:28 pm, August 06, 2020 "
"Yes I read the daily reports from the ECDC, that's because the 14 day figures for these countries as reported today are:Andorra 65.6Bahamas 136Belgium 53.8The UK is 14.3 and Cyprus is 16, below 20 is considered low risk by the ECDC. See link attached.https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueeaEdited: 4:01 pm, August 06, 2020 "
In daily figures given by Cyprus are detections of cases at airport arrivals which in reality are cases of originating countries. There were 4 out of 13 today. With new measures and very high number of tests carried out in a few days it will be back to normal. The problem was locals coming back from Greece without any tests. Mykonos was the epicenter plus others coming from Cat C countries through Greece and hiding their start of journey. A lady came from US and not gone on self isolation contaminating 22 people
"Good to hear they are managing it well but a shame people are using loopholes to get in bringing the virus in, I'm sure numbers will come down soon."
"I saw the news about the lady from the USA doing a ""Stanley Johnson"" as it's referred to here - starting your journey by flying to one place and then making an onward journey from that destination as it is deemed ""safe"" by the authorities at your destination. Hope she does not cause any deaths and hear that the justice ministry is considering action against her.I guess all the numbers above must be per head of population because the UK has gone up from 2,000 infections per day at the end of June to 4,000 this week.Edited: 8:46 pm, August 06, 2020 "
"Good Morning all, Having read the latest posts on here I am now less confident of us travelling. Why is it that Jet2 and Tui are cancelling flights yet I haven't heard anything regarding our Ryanair flight!?The more I think about it the more I realise that It wouldn't be such a disaster if ours is eventually cancelled, at least we wouldn't be travelling with the worry of everything. It would be a shame as it is due to be our first time in Cyprus but there is always next year, our plan is to use the voucher or whatever we receive and go next June."
"Latimer I don't know where you get your numbers for the daily UK infections from but this is the correct source, about 800 to 900 per day not 4000! Please try to quote accurate information.https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/casesEdited: 3:35 am, August 07, 2020 "
"Hi Latimer,You need to take note of the helpful link provided by Paula https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueeaYou will find Cyprus has a higher infection number per head of population than the UK"
Jet2 will resume flights to Cyprus from August 17 said Deputy Minister of Tourism
Tui & Jet2 carry mainly holidaymakers & those are for the main on packages. They don’t want their reps dealing with sick people who have no valid insurance plus a lot of hotels their passengers were going to have decided not to reopen yet. Ryanair don’t do package holidays & carry Cyprus Nationals like students back & forth as well.. If their flights are running even with 20 passengers they can keep the money from other passengers who can’t or would rather not travel & not need to give refunds so it’s no skin off their nose to keep their flights going even if the UK passengers can’t meet the immigration requirements in Cyprus.
"Cylib, where is that being reported as it kind of suggests that the UK will move to Cat A as both Tui and Jet2 have stated that they will not resume flights to Cyprus until there are no tests required.Just seen it online now Cylib, thanksEdited: 7:12 am, August 07, 2020 "
Thanks for the links - I am aware of all sources of information because I have to be.Positive tests in the UK have increased for the third week running and yesterday there were over 900.That is positive tests and the office for National Statistics plus public health England always provide an estimate of infection based on the number of infected people yet to test or asymptomatic.The per head of population measure is a bit of a nonsense when you compare a 1 million population to a 60 million population.Cyprus was Covid free and since it opened its borders it isn’t. I do understand the nightmare of trying to balance economic need and public health risk but suspect that UK will introduce quarantine for Cyprus before Cyprus drops UK to cat C again.And I’d be surprised if UK gets to Cat A this year
"I think it’s worth mentioning that the increase in cases in Cyprus has not been attributed to UK visitors. That’s assuming the Cyprus Mail have the correct information. But, I agree with you. With the R rate in Cyprus far higher than the UK, I don’t think it will be long before UK add quarantine rules to flights arriving from Cyprus. Sadly, I am due to fly out in 3 weeks."
"Yes Latimer you are correct, you cannot make a direct comparison between a county with a population of just over 1million and the U.K. with 68million. The U.K. is now top of the table in the EU for number of tests conducted. So positive tests will be higher. The WHO have stated that testing is the way forward so the U.K. is doing the right thing. The rest of the EU need to follow."
"Any source naming countries who are doing very detailed contact tracing, they're following asymptomatic cases, they're following contacts to find secondary transmission onwards?Any source naming cost per private test to encourage (or not) the general population to get checked up?Direct comparison between countries is impossible, and I sincerely hope that experts in countries have an open line and discuss in details rather than take decisions based on online figures.Edited: 9:36 am, August 07, 2020 "
This is a good place to go to check on if percentage of those tested is going up.https:/…country-overviewsUK looking good as is Cyprus. Spain looking bad.
"Are we expecting any kind of update this week from Cyprus? Just over 3 weeks until we are due to fly from London Stansted with Ryanair, it still feels too early for us to expect to go but we are hopeful."
"The official archive is at https:/…fly.htmlI'd have a look tomorrow, as the previous file was posted on 4/Aug,"
"Brother woke up this morning to news that he will now have to quarantine for 14 days once he lands back from Malta. He is flying this afternoon with his partner, luckily for them both they are both on furlough until October so doesn't effect them too much.I however work full time and do not have the option of working from home so this has made me really realise how quickly things can change from day to day. We still intend on flying in 3 weeks, just hopefully we can enjoy a holiday with little hassle as possible, although we know there will always be a risk,"
If he is flying this afternoon from Malta then ( subject to the usual nonsensical rules) they will not have to quarantine UNLESS their flight lands after 4am UK time on Saturday.This is because the virus has an alarm clock and won't infect anyone today !!
"Didn’t make it clear, he is flying from London to Malta this afternoon and back next Friday. Just goes to show it can happen anywhere at any time."
"That doesn't sound too bad Dag, people have lost a lot more. We are just a bit in limbo as to what to do really. We still have 2 and a half weeks till we are due to fly. I have read a few posts recently where flying has gone really smoothly which is positive. We dont want to cancel as we wont get anything back. If our holiday is cancelled then hopefully it is not last minute."
"If it's of any use we've just come back from Greece and apart from the hassle of filling in their PLF form, the worry of being selected for random testing on arrival, we weren't, and having to wear a mask in the airport and on the plane, we had a fantastic 2 weeks away and it did us the world of good, we almost forgot there was a global pandemic whilst we were there! So my advice is go if you can, you never know if might be the last chance for a while if things get worse again. We're due to go on 16th September and we're definitely going if we can."
"We will definitely travel if we can, worked throughout this pandemic and need a break!  Have just read how there have only been 2 deaths today for England so we have come a long way since 800+ daily deaths. I just hope we don’t see a big increase over the next few weeks as its coming round quickly now just over 2 weeks until we are due to fly."
I think Cyprus will like to see a sustained improvement in the UK and hopefully will make us Category A come 1st September. I hope they are being sensible and looking at percentage of positive tests against number performed. The UK seem to be doing the most tests out of everyone.
No change for the UK still category B after today’s review.
Have been trying to find out status....how did you find news of today’s review ?
Me too I have looked at Cyprus Mail and Knews and also on Gov website and can't find anything.Would be interesting to read the article.
Managed to find this but mainly downgrades https:/…
Looks like Tui have cancelled all flights until 2nd Sept.
"Sorry to ask another question , but how did you find out about Tui? Thought they were restarting next week ...."
When you go on their website to book a holiday you can’t book one with them to Cyprus until 2nd Sept.
"2 weeks now until we are due to fly and still do not feel like we know what is going on or what to expect and I suppose we wont until 3 or 4 days before we fly. Talking to people most feel Cyprus will be ok but you just never know, I am starting to feel like our chances of flying are good but we know its not for sure. I am hoping that this time in 2 weeks we will soon be on our way to the airport but will continue to take it day by day and hope for the best."
BD1991 are you booked with Tui?I'm the same and just want to know either way. I've got alternative plans if Tui say we aren't flying you due to testing but would rather know now than 4 days before we due to go.
Flight on 29th with Tui cancelled last night ....
"Hi Phil, No im with Ryanair, booked a package holiday through loveholidays. I read last night Ryanair are planning on reducing their flights by 20% through Sept-Oct however there was no mention of Cyprus being effected. I contacted our hotel the other day and they plan to stay open throughout, obviously now just have safety measures in place in the hotel. It can all change in a couple of days so feel it is still to early to know what is going on, hopefully we know a few days in advance what is going on and not last minute."
At least Tui have honoured their statement not to fly unless UK in A...unlike Jet2! We have amended our booking to next year as we’d have issues wearing masks for around 8 hours as well as obtaining a test in the time constraints. Now I appreciate this was our choice and accept paying next years prices and arranging fee but Jet 2 have also removed my loyalty discount that I booked with and upped price of luggage so it was nearly £300 more! This also happened in April. Does question my loyalty when we fly with them at least 3 trips a year.
"As far as air travel is concerned, I think we will be seeing price rises across the board for the foreseeable future."
Tui confirming across twitter to people now that they've cancelled all holidays to Cyrpus until 31st Aug.
"After a long 6 months since we booked we now fly a week tomorrow. Was looking online last night at booking Covid tests and looks like the 2 closest to us only offer tests up until 1pm daily and with our flight at 5pm we will book to have ours done early Monday morning. Usually we would be excited right about now but it feels very strange. Most of me feels fine travelling, Cyprus have very few cases its just part of me wondering if we should but at the same time having read a lot of positive trips over the last few weeks I am hoping we have the same experience and we can enjoy our first visit to Cyprus."
Have a good trip.
"BD1991We are here in Paphos now and I can understand your mixed feelings. The trauma trying to get the Covid test done and getting the results back in time is the worst. Ours was exceptionally long 54 hours. However, after that everything was okay. The flight with easyjet was good. Flight not full which is unusual for this time of the year. Paphos is lovely. Not as many people here but if you didnt know about Covid being in existence you wouldnt really know. We are going to our normal restaurants, usually booking first. Went to Venus Beach to swim yesterday, amazing. This was very dangerous for swimming, people have drowned over the years with the current. A great deal of money has been spent making breakwaters to create a safe place for swimmers. There is a sandy beach, showers and toilets (not the best but functionable) and sunbeds and umbrellas to hire. Walking about is easy. You have to wear a mask if you go inside anywhere. The weather is glorious over 30 degrees. Enjoy."
"BD1991 if you want an afternoon test, you will need to book it in the morning of the day you want it. Afternoon slots are only released once all the morning slots in your area are taken.You can only book a few hours in advance, not days."
"Hi Garry, Happy to hear everything worked out well for you in the end! I thought you could book the covid test days in advance but found out last night that is not the case. Our flight is at 5pm Wednesday and would ideally like to have the test around 7pm this Sunday but not sure if we can have it that late, first thing Monday morning might have to do.54 hours , i would be sweating! If that is the case with us and we we end up doing the test Monday morning that would only leave us with hours to spare but hopefully you were just very unlucky and we get ours back in 24 hours. Paphos sounds lovely, me and my girlfriend are more into the pool then the beach so its not the end of the world if the beach isn't the best, we would probably only visit the beach twice during a 10 day stay. Hopefully this time next week we would have just woken up for our first morning and everything would have gone smoothly."
"Thanks for that Armchairloco, 7pm test would be best so will look on the Sunday to see if that is possible."
Hi BD1991We flew at 14.45 Tuesday so we booked our test giving us as many hours as possible. Our test centre is open Monday to Friday 8am - 8pm. I think that was the problem with it being done on a weekend. We couldnt book for our afternoon test until after 11am the same day when further slots were released. I would recommend you upload your Cyprus Flight pass early and if your test is late coming back you only have to upload your appointment and test result for each passenger it saves time.
BD1991 A 5 or 5:30 test would be best. As you can see from Garry's post every hour counts!Be aware that they may not release the early evening slots until the afternoon ones are filled.
"Hi both i have just checked online and can see our local test centre closes at 2.30 on Sunday which is no help to us, I will ring them sometime today to confirm this and if that is the case will have to see what other centres are available for us to have a test on the Sunday afternoon/evening. With it being bank holiday Monday next week too i hope it doesn’t cause us any hassle having to have a test first thing Monday morning if we have to. Garry - thanks for the tip re the Cyprus flight pass, can we upload it as early as today or will the weekend do?"
"Good morning We’ve not booked yet and are looking at Monday morning flights (7am out of Luton) on 21st Sept.We have a 2 yr old, will she need a test ?Also we’re looking to stay around Paphos, how busy is it at the moment ?"
Your 2 year old won’t need a test.
"Just checked online to see the availability for tomorrow just to see and the they are saying the nearest test centre is 51 miles away.When i looked yesterday we had 3 centres within 5 miles, Is it just a case of me checking every 20/30 minutes to see what becomes available?"
"BD,You need to check after 9pm on the day before, I had the same issue until I read a post on here - can't find who from - slots don't become available until after then.HTH"
"It was probably me.As I said in another related post...The system releases test slots in batches throughout the day. When the morning ones in your wider local area are filled in, it will release some in the afternoon, when those are filled up, it will release early evening slots. If you try and book in the early evening, there may be no slots near you left and you may be shown centres in Manchester or Inverness. Anywhere in the UK with a free test slot. Check after 8pm when the test centres close and you may see morning slots in your local area again. You need to keep checking because they don't all get released at the stroke of 8.The booking system's priority is to make best use of the available testing resources.Edited: 7:49 am, August 27, 2020 "
"The suspense is killing me! Had our tests done yesterday, it's now been 24 hours and still nothing! Don't know why we do this to ourselves :)"
All well checking 9pm the day before but but what about for a 5-8pm slot? I checked an hour ago and just now and still nothing for this afternoon close to us. Luckily this Sunday we have no plans so will constantly be checking from the morning to see if we can get a Sunday afternoon slot. If we dont get a Sunday afternoon slot then will be on the site all Sunday evening to make sure we get early one for Monday.
Keep checking. They come and go very quickly.
BD1991We uploaded our Cyprus Flight Pass a week before we travelled to save time and it was good that we did with the test result taking 54 hours. I have just read my last post our test centre was open Monday to Sunday 8am to 8pm. I had put Monday to Friday. Must be the sun or Keo that's affecting my thinking. Our test centre was only 10 miles away and there were very few people using it.
"Hi Garry, I keep reading about this Keo, looking forward to trying it for the first time! (Hopefully) I will just keep checking all day Sunday and hopefully we can get an appointment between 6-8pm Sunday. I will have a look into the Cyprus flight pass tonight."
"Garry, You say you uploaded the Cyprus flight pass week before your flight. I have just been on the website and I have created an account but now having done that it says I must wait until 24 hours before my flight until I can actually apply for the pass. Bit confusing, if I have to wait until 24 hours before we fly to apply then what did you actually upload the week before your flight? Sorry if this is obvious to many but this is our first time to Cyprus so not familiar with what is required."
"BD1991I entered all our details onto the Cyprus flight pass for all three of us and saved the information. Once we had got the Covid test results I then uploaded the information and requested permission to fly which you can only do 24 hours before you fly. Sorry if I confused you. You can register and open an account and save the information but for them to grant permission to fly they need the Covid appointment and test result, which you can only submit 24 hours before you fly. This a new document not normally required, only brought in because of Covid."
"Ok thanks for clearing that up. It is only me and my girlfriend travelling. I have created an account, am I supposed to add her details on this same account or does she have to create her own account too? I cannot see anywhere that I can also add her details."
"BD1991, I need a late afternoon test and I also want them to do it for us, but our nearest drive through only offers self tests. I rang 119 today & the lady told me about a test site a bit further away that will do the test for us and also said if I ring back on the morning I want my test they'll book us in for the time slot we want. You might want to try this to save you having to refresh regularly?"
"Hi Andrea, Thanks for that information. I will give 119 a call tomorrow to see what they can advise. It is good that we are in a position to get free testing however don’t really want to have to be online for hours refreshing every 15 minutes and hoping for a test to become available, what if it doesn't?When you spoke to the lady on the phone did you say it was required for a flight or because you had symptoms? Not sure if it is best to make out i have any symptoms or if it wont make any difference.Edited: 4:56 pm, August 27, 2020 "
"If you make out you have symptoms, you will be required to isolate for 14 days."
"BD1991Under the same account I created three separate files for myself, my wife and my grandson who lives with us. So we could all carry our own papers."
"Not sure if anyone else has experience with this? My husband and I had our tests done together and I got my test results back after 32 hours and he is still waiting for his?Edited: 4:26 am, August 28, 2020 "
"Good morning all! I came home last night and my girlfriend had a temperature/ cough , she has been told by work today to have a covid test. She went online around 8.15 this morning and was able to book a slot for midday at a test centre 8 miles away so not too bad and they had slots up until 8pm. Hopefully the tests come back negative by tomorrow afternoon, I have been told by work to have the day off to and isolate until her results come back. At least we know that booking early morning should result in us getting the booking we want Sunday between 6-8pm. Just fingers crossed her results come back negative."
"Oh no after all your planning, hope it comes back negative!"
"It would be typical Paulaf! Chances are low of it coming back positive but you never know! If it does come back positive then at least we will know by tomorrow and we will just have to see what loveholidays offer us, I wouldnt mind putting it back until next year if we have to. If it comes back negative then we know we are in a good position for flying next Wednesday.Edited: 5:03 am, August 28, 2020 "
"Fingers crossed for you, at least you've had a trial run of a test and booking it!"
"Hi BD1991, yes I explained it was for a flight next weekend, as she wanted to book me in for a test there and then. She was fine and seemed to be familiar with the requirement. I think if you say you have symptoms you'll have to self isolate for 14 days so I'd advise against suggesting you have symptoms."
"Well my girlfriend had a test today and she put on the application she had symptoms and no mention of her having to self isolate for 14 days just for having symptoms, of course if her test comes back positive tomorrow then she and I will self isolate.If her test comes back negative then we will try book first thing Sunday morning online , if no good then I will try calling 119."
"Girlfriends results came back 4.05am (15.5 hours after test, negative! Relief to know she is OK, I am going to check at 8am to see what slots are available for today as a test run. Want to book ours tomorrow morning for 6-8pm tomorrow.Edited: 1:08 am, August 29, 2020 "
"If you have symptoms (cough, temperature, or loss of taste/smell) you must set isolate for 10 days, regardless of whether or not you have booked a test. Your household members must also isolate for 14 days. If you have a test and it is negative, you should continue to isolate until you no longer have symptoms (but not the full 10 days if your symptoms clear up before then). I’m glad your girlfriend’s test has come back negative, but she should continue to isolate until her symptoms clear up.The rules around self isolation for symptomatic people have not changed considerably since March. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/c…"
"We have no plans from now until we fly in 4 days so will not be going anywhere, all we have to do is go for our test tomorrow and that will just be us 2 in the car, we are off work until 14th September."
"Have been on the gov website last 20 minutes to see what is available, 59 miles is the closest test to me. I have refreshed at least 10 times and it has not changed, am I supposed to be refreshing all morning until something close pops up or is it best to call 119. I don't need to book until tomorrow but don't want to be on the website all morning worrying about not being able to book a test! I have checked the site several times over the last week and not once seen an available slot close to me"
I have just got through to someone on 119 after only 5 minutes holding who advised best times to have a look on the site is 8pm and 12am.Will have a look tonight/ early tomorrow morning and hopefully I can get a slot for tomorrow fairly easily.
"So glad she was negative but hope gf feels ok, you've only got one hurdle left so hope you can get a test tonight, will you let us know as I will be in your shoes in 2 weeks time."
"She is much better, she still has cough but nowhere near as bad as it was yesterday, im just hoping its not something i pick up over the next few days! I will update when my test is booked, hopefully tonight."
"look again later best around 9pm for next day. We initially looked and had a 60 mile drive , looked later and had option of centre in our town so much better"
"6pm test booked for tonight, very easy process in the end, at least that gives us 70 hours before flight to get test back.  Anyone who needs an afternoon test try from 8am the morning of flight and you will be fine.Edited: 3:25 am, August 30, 2020 "
"Thanks Gemma! Feels very strange, flying on Wednesday and haven’t really even thought about it. Now that I am thinking about it, I am looking forward to our first trip to Cyprus. Just hopefully I am not left sweating on the results, fingers crossed!"
Good luck with your test and results! We fly Tuesday afternoon and did our test yesterday at 2:30pm I woke up to a negative result at 6am this morning which was a super fast turnaround we are now waiting for partners results as he has had nothing yet! It’s stressful!!
"Hi Tiff, Yes I have read a few posts on here saying how some have had theres but their partners are taking that bit longer, i expect that to happen with us. We have given ourselves 70 hours to get both ours back so fingers crossed we can have both back within 48 hours so we are not left sweating too much!"
"Glad you got it booked ok, I'll do a dummy booking next Saturday night or Sunday morning to see what's available. Just relax now and start packing!"
"Hope all goes well.I am really stressing now I have found out Tui are not keeping there promise not to take us if we needed testing. I am getting really stressed if we need to take the test if it will be back in time. Hoping we may change to A before beginning of October,Maybe is an age thing!Edited: 5:10 am, August 30, 2020 "
"I don't know how old you are, but preparing for this trip has been one of the most stressful things I have done for a long time.If It wasn't for the fact that we would have kissed goodbye to a lot of money, I wouldn't have bothered."
"Hi ACL, I turned 30 end of March just days after it hit the UK. Maybe it was meant to be for us this year as usually we go Spain/ Canary Islands but having now done all 4 of the canaries we fancied trying somewhere else and went for Paphos. I am glad that the booking of the test ended up being straightforward, now I am just hoping we get our results back in plenty of time. We booked our holiday in early February and as our hotel is open and Ryanair are flying we have no choice but to go or lose £1100 each, we are happy to travel but would definately not have booked anywhere during this pandemic.Edited: 6:33 am, August 30, 2020 "
"Armchairloco,  same here .I retired as a Nurse Manager at 71 , almost 73 now and my job did not cause me the stress that this holiday has:)"
"I know what you mean, we went to Greece in July and that was stressful as you don't get your QR code to travel until 10pm the night before and then you are subject to random testing and if positive you are quarantined for 14 days and there was a couple of horror stories about that before we went. But after about 2 days all the stress went and when we came home after 2 weeks we felt so much better and more relaxed, try and have a news blackout whilst you are there too as that helped us."
"Just under 24 hours since test and neither of our results back, not quite panic mode yet but ideally would have liked at least one back by now. Have just started packing but the feeling of still not being 100% sure whats going on is still there, hopefully can have one if not both results back by the morning. At least those flying over the next few weeks have enough on this forum now to understand what its like at the moment and how it will likely be up till 24 hours before flight until you can truly relax."
"Oh, it doesn't stop when you get on the plane! If somebody on your plane tests positive when you get there, you all have to spend a fortnight cooped up in a hotel courtesy of the Cypriot government.We have been here three days. I think we are safe!"
"Armchairloco, im beginning to feel like it would have been better if we had been flying with Jet2 or Tui and our holiday was cancelled and we were given the option to push our holiday back to next year which we gladly would have done. Of course, we want a holiday but only if we get there and avoid any of this potential mess but feel we have been in a position where we have to fly or lose over £2k. We haven’t had any contact through love holidays and only today we have had an email reminding us of our flight from Ryanair. We still have a few steps to go, hopefully our results come back in the next 24 hours and we will just have to see what happens when we land in Paphos."
"We are going with Tui and they will not let us have a free amend. We paid 4200 for this holiday and they wanted us to pay another 2700 to move it to April. We will have to take our chances that the test will be back in time, such a worry. When we booked the holiday we moved it from Jet 2 as Tui said that they would not take us if we were told to take tests or quarantine. I cannot get any response from them now either on messenger or Twitter, :(My real hope is that we will gain an A category prior to October."
"That is really bad Lynda, I didn't realise how bad it is for some people. Ours is through Love holidays, paid £2100 upfront as soon as we booked in Feb for the two of us for flights, hotel and transfers. We have ATOL protection but god knows what is covered with that these days."
"I really hope you get your tests back tomorrow, let us know."
"Thanks, I'm doing my best!Likewise, I hope you enjoy you holiday in Cumbria and have an equally good time in Cyprus next year."
"37 hours and still no results, not stressing just yet but thought and hoped I would wake up to them this morningI am going into work for the day today, i then am off until 14th September, just don’t know if I will be in Cyprus or last minute UK break somewhere. Feels strange not knowing what is happening the day before we are due to fly but that is the way it is these days for a lot of us. I will give it until mid afternoon and if still no results will call 119."
"Keep us updated if you can, Hope it all goes well for you."
Keeping everything crossed that your results come back today BD and you are on that flight tomorrow.
"45 hours , still nothing :( Just spoke to someone on 119 he did say taking a bit longer the last week or two but still 95% should receive back within 48 hours, just typical we are one of the few left worrying now. He took all my details and our barcode and everything is fine its just a case of waiting, just hopefully not much longer."
"I really hope you have your test results by now and are looking forward to your holiday, it has been a stressful time for all."
"Still nothing Lynda, I will call again in a few hours if nothing. I cant remember who it was on here but they had theres back after 54 hours, i wouldnt have at the time of the test but I would take that now, that would be midnight for us. Its just the not knowing which is the hard part, so close now and still not sure what is going on and where I will be in 24 hours."
I've got my fingers crossed for you BD.
If you get your results tomorrow (the day you travel) will you be able to upload your flight pass & be ok to travel? I’m asking because I’ll be in your situation end of month
Fingers and toes crossed for you hope to hear a good result soon
I will be thinking of you and hoping it all goes ok. On a very selfish note I hope things will have calmed down again before we fly. I have never stressed so much about a holiday.
"Thanks Armchairloco, fingers crossed.Allan, yes I assume I can wait if I have to until around midday tomorrow (hopefully doesn't take that long!) Lynda, i am not too stressed about it, i would be disappointed of course if we don't make it but hopefully I can get something back in terms of credit/refund and go next year, although i would be surprised if we get our flights back from Ryanair, have read they are doing there very best not to look after anyone during these times. Quick question, I am doing the cyprus flight pass now, i have done my bit and saved draft, how do i go about doing my girlfriends, do I have to submit mine first before I can do hers? or is it easier for her to do her own?"
"BD, you submit your application, then a pop-up appears asking you to upload your test results, then you can ad another member of your party. Submit that, then you submit their test results. Rinse and repeat. If I remember correctly, it auto fills all the boxes with the same as yours, so you need to change those if different."
