Anyone seen his show at the Planet Hollywood Forum Shops? I have read some good reviews on him as an entertainer but was wondering about the show at PH restaurant.

Well I will HAVE to go!!!!!!!NOT...scammers

"Thank you Dexter103, glad to hear what you said. When I saw I had several replies I thought I was getting some good feedback, but Dexter103 made up for the deleted replies.Edited: 8 years ago "
"It doesnt' want to let me edit my post now, or I would put notes in there. Evidently TA doesn't let the show get reviewed as they don't classify it as a true 'show' yet. On his facebook page he requested fans visit TA. So it does appear these are fans & are just responding - also creating new traffic to this site. And that's why nearly all would be new sign-ups.I did spot one positive post from someone with a lot more posts but now that one has been deleted also? Not sure what happened to that one, as it did provide credibility as it was a seasoned poster.So I retract my IP comment (although it definitely would help in other cases!)"

went to one of his shows for our cooporate Christmas party. Totally hallarious kept us all laughing the whole time.
Oh good gravy.
"Well my post was 100% REAL and I did just sign up for trip advisor because of Jeff's request on Facebook. However, if this is the way trip advisor handles honest, real posts about a totally LEGIT Vegas show....not sure I even wana stay signed up. So good job trip advisor! Jeff Civillico got people to sign up for your website and you have ran them off! Now that's how you do business! BTDub.....JEFF CIVILLICO....You rock! And the rest of you losers need to get a lifeEdited: 8 years ago "
"Yourstarla, gravy is indeed good! And I dont even work for or sell gravy!!"
I'm so confused.
Me again. Long time poster. I was going thru other threads & hit the one regarding coupons. On this link:www.lasvegas-nv.com/las-vegas-coupons.htmthere is a coupon for the show & a meal (choice of about 6 items) for $25. Not a bad price for entertainment & food. So it would be a good price to give it your own evaluation & hopefully we won't all continue to be confused.
He is great!! My son still watches his DVD and tries to do the same things as Jeff does in his act! He is TOTALLY Legitimit and should be seen if you get a chance!!Tracy Maxwell
"Dear tripadvisor: I am a new poster, drawn to your site by Jeff's request that we tell you about his show - imagine my dismay that you deleted my honest post and accused it of not being legit! Do you think that I will ever use your site now? Highly unlikely. Way to turn off new customers!"
Turkey gravy. That's the good stuff.
This is funny stuff

Well good thing this site is supose to be about honest OPINIONS of his show...good OR bad. From new or old users so that people can make their own decisions. And seeing as how your the only negative review .....I'd say....your the fool with no taste :)
I didn't think my honest question would cause all of this! I have been a member here since 2007 and a reader even longer. I was really hoping to get some real feedback on this show.
Jeff Rocks We came from Aruba to LV and we saw Jeff in the show of Nathan Burton and we thought en still think Jeff is awesome. Our jaws hurt from laughing. Its a must see! Go and ENJOY!!!!!
I saw him at Planet Hollywood Forum Shops! I laughed myself silly. It's non-stop fun! Highly recommend it to anyone. Bring your friends. You will not be sorry you went. Allen Merritt
"You really don't GET IT. Someone should not have to TELL people to say they were good. If they truly are good that will come out naturally.All of you, although you meant well, did nothing but HARM this Jeff who-ever-he-is.I would not go see him in a million years now.Do you get it now?"
"My 1st post was an honest review along with a few others but they were all acused of being fake and deleted so that's why it has turned into this. In short, he is hilarious and I laughed so hard I cried. Definitely go see :)"
"Maybe you dont understand, Jeff Civillico didn't tell anyone to say good things. He asked people who saw his show to go say what we thought of it....good or bad. So if you don't wana go see him....that's your choice. And the point of trip advisor....isn't it?"
"nici, the point of TA is to get the opinions of people who have the one thing that none of you guys rooting for Jeff have - CREDIBILITY. If you can't work out why this is so then I certainly won't waste my time explaining it. The way that your buddy Jeff has gone about this is laughable and as far as this forum is concerned, with your help he's done himself no favors. There are many posters on here who visit Vegas several times per year and who have opinions that are both trusted and respected along with the fact that they offer them without being prompted. When they say a show is worth seeing, I'll go check it out.Edited: 8 years ago "

"Jeff didn't ask anyone to say he was good. He can't get tripadvisor to list his show because they don't seem to think that Planet Hollywood is a legit venue in Vegas, so he asked his fans to post about his show so that tripadvisor would at least list him. He's an honest guy trying to make a living as an entertainer, Disney hires him all the time, so I think that speaks to the quality of his performances, he'd just like to get his Vegas show noticed by tripadvisor. Not sure why some of you are being haters, go see his show and if you don't like it, let people know..."
"Blagger - go to Jeff's Facebook fan page and see how this conversation got started. He doesn't ask anyone to say good things about him, he just wants to get tripadvisor's attention after many attempts to contact them..."
"A bunch of new, first time posters come on at once and post gushing comments about a show most people have never heard of, and you're puzzled as to why people are suspicious?"
"Disney hires him all the time, so I think that speaks to the quality of his performances:::::::::::::::Ummm....er.......well.....If he's quality for Disney he's probably not for Vegas lol"
"He does a G/PG performance for the entire ship, then a more PG performance at night in the lounge - the audience assistants often carry this into R territory just from their reactions..."
"Funny. Engaging. Entertaining. One of the best shows we saw in Las Vegas! Lots of audience interaction. If you want a fun show on the strip, you have to check it out!"
"Great show!! Family friendly, extremely funny, energetic!! I have seen it numerous times and laugh so hard. Always amazed on how talented Jeff is!!!"
"Wow...this ""Jeff Civillico"" thing is turning into an epidemic. Where can I get a shot to prevent me catching it?I wonder if hes as funny as ""Bobby whothehellami"" plays every February 30th or that great British comedian ""Barry corblimeyguvnorlordluvaduck""..another classic"
"Yes, Lucy. There is a shot. Go see Carrot Top and he gives away shots of Crown Royal. :)"
"You know what's really sad? I just went on Youtube and watched a little of Jeff. He seems like he's very funny and a nice guy. I would't mind seeing his show at all.Unfortunately, the way all of you went about this caused the exact opposite reaction to what you intended. I don't know why Tripadvisor is not allowing his show to be listed...is he a semi-permanent resident at the Planet Hollywood restaurant? And maybe THAT is the problem...I first went looking to see if his show was listed at PH hotel or the Miracle Mile shops, and it wasn't - because it's at Planet Hollywood restaurant at the Forum Shops, and people often get those places confused (like the Palm restaurant and the Palms hotel). I know the original post does mention that, but I just focused on ""Planet Hollywood"".Maybe JGCalifornia, the OP, will come back and say where they saw the show mentioned, that could give you an idea of where he is being advertised. Unfortunately, because the Forum Shops are not technically part of Caesars, he wouldn't be mentioned on their entertainment list, either.I now really do see your dilemma, but the way you went about this was just not the way to do it on this forum.Another possibility would be Yelp. People go there a lot for reviews. Maybe you could get it listed under Entertainment or Shows under Las Vegas.Edited: 8 years ago "
There she goes again being the voice of reason. I thought they were talking about the hotel all of the time too.
"Jeff and friends,You likely won't get much support here--a few old cows who think they control this forum. I'm not sure I understand why TA has refused your act to be listed for review or whatever the issue is. I guess I'm late to the party, and it's difficult to make sense of the thread with all the post removals. Perhaps go to the Support Forum or the Help Center for assistance:tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g1-i12105-TripAdvi…http://www.tripadvisor.com/help"
To anyone who has any question of why the show might not be listed on here or anywhere else. A. He has a self run box office and no legitimate ticket broker.B. He has almost no outside advertisement to the show most of the audience comes from self promotion in other vegas shows.C. By his own admission it is a one man show which weather good or bad put him in my opinion the same class as a street performer working for basically tips.
"I was in Veas a few weeks ago & attended a fairly new afternoon show that was just on a few days a week. The ""star""of the show invited people to come to the afternoon show that was on the other days. The other ""star"" was in the audience. He said that the entertainer has to rent to showroom. This is probably not cheap. What is cheap? I have never heard of Jeff Civillico, but I had never heard of a lot of the show that I have seen in Vegas. I am returning the end of March. I will try to check this out. Thanks, Marilyn"
