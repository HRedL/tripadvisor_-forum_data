"Considering this year's epedemic outbreak of Dengue Fever in in other Caribbean Islands , including neighouring Martinique, what is the situation in St Lucia? nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/07/18/2010-0…dailynewsengine.com/759/…We are a bit worried by the dengue fever outbreak since we are travelling to St Lucia in March with out 7 month old son."
"We are not suffering with it right now, even after the hurricane.The government spray the island periodically if anything arises, and have also been smoking the towns after the hurricane. If we get an outbreak you will hear about it."
"I don't know what you would term an ""outbreak"" but I personally know four people who have had dengue in the last month so it is around. The best thing is to make sure the baby sleeps under a net (you can buy nets for cots) and keep him/her covered up in the evening and early morning when the mozzies are at their worst. Hopefully you are staying at one of the bigger resorts which spray."
"Thank you for your kind reply. The term ""Outbreak"" referred to situtaion in Guadeloupe and Martinique earlier this year where over 40000 cases were reported. The number of Dengue fever cases also seems to be higher than normal in the Caribbean this year. We are planning to go to St Lucia in April and are planning to stay att the Hummingbird in Soufriere sine we like the beachside location. Some othe places like Ti-Kaye and Anse Chastenet does not allow childeren. However, some reviews mention mosquito issue at the Hummingbird, this worries since we have a young child as we dont want her run the risk of getting dengue fever."
"If it's any consolation, the authorities in Martinique and Guadaloupe have now announced that the Dengue Fever epedemic is officially over:leparisien.fr/laparisienne/sante/dengue-fin-…There are still cases arising, but at a much reduced level.Also bear in mind that most of the people catching Dengue in Martinique have been local people, not holiday makers. If you are staying in a medium to large resort, they will fog regularly, and eliminate any pools of stagnant water (where mosquitos breed) on the resort."
There are some good resources on the CDC website for those that care...…cdc.gov/travel/content/outbreak-notice/deng……cdc.gov/travel/destinations/saint-lucia.aspx
"You do know, of course, that the effects on human health of the chemicals used by resorts to fog against mosquitos are often worse than dengue fever."
