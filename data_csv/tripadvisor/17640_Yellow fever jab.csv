It’s Brazil that has the yellow fever epidemic. Consult your GP. the jab lasts a lifetime so it’s woth having anyway. I saw this in today’s New York Timeshttps:/…brazil-yellow-fever.html
Excellent article #1. Just a reminder to all reading this post. The YF vaccine takes a minimum of 10 days to generate an immune response. Thus don't wait until you get to border and think you will have a quick cheap jab and be covered. It also is a Live vaccine so there are some potential nasty side effects you can get so better to have well in advance of travel as these can occur weeks after inoculation. In saying that I had mine as those risks to me a minimal in comparison to getting the potential disease.
