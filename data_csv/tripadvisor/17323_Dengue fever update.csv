"Hi, I'm traveling with a 20 months baby to Palawan for 2 weeks in the beginning of November 2019. I'm worried about the warnings of dengue epidemic and wanted to know if it is better to cancel my trip. I read that the epidemic was declared in several parts of Philippines and didn't found any information about Palawan. Could anyone help with any advice about places to visit with less risk or if it is better to cancel and go another time?"
Nothing has changed. Just take precautions against mosquitoes and don't let it interfere with your holiday.
There is some dengue cases but they are mostly in the south so just make your mind up. 60 people caught dengue in El Nido in July so the odds are good that you will avoid it.
