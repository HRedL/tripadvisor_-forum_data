"What can the Dominican Republic, specifically the La Altagracia Province (Punta Cana, et al), do about removing the risk of contracting Malaria through infected mosquitoes? Are they not spraying or taking any measures to combat this? I know there is medication to take to prevent it, but what about removing the risk entirely? Puerto Plata does not have this warning. I love Punta Cana and will return there, taking the required medication to prevent Malaria. I also like to donate blood plasma to Canadian Blood Services here at home and upon my return from Punta Cana I am not able to donate for 6 months due to the Blood Services policy regarding travel to this area and the possibility of malarial infection. I know donated blood products are very much in demand and needed to save lives and I would like to be able to do it 12 months of the year. Any thoughts or knowledge would be appreciated. Cheers! "
"I wouldn't worry too much about malaria or even dengue fever (which you are at more of a risk of). Like any illness spread by mosquitoes, there is a risk but it is slight at best. I live in the United States in Ohio and we are exposed to West Nile Virus and a slew of other harsh sounding diseases transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks. Honestly, not to make light of this at all, but I could think of far worse places to contract an illness carried by a mosquito that lying on a gorgeous beach with a drink in hand. "
Like I said in my previous post...I don't try to to make light of this situation so here is a link to an informative alert from the United States State Department regarding malaria and dengue feverusemb.gov.do/Consular/ACS/Dengue-Malaria.pdf
"Thanks for the info. As I said in my original post, I am not worried about getting the disease. I will take the required medication to prevent it. My thoughts were directed to being unable to continue to donate blood products. I know it is my choice to go to the DR and not be able to donate, but I would like to see steps taken to get rid of this restriction. Cheers!"
"~~~~~~~~My thoughts were directed to being unable to continue to donate blood products.~~~~~~~~~~Here's a funny thing about that, since I lived in Europe between 1985-1989 the US Red Cross has deferred me from donating due to my possible exposure to Mad Cow disease! This deferment has only recently been put into effect and as little as 10 years ago I donated bone marrow and was a constant Apheresis donor. Go figure!"
Its not that you have to worry about getting it. We just have to be aware that it does existe and can happen.I really don't worry about it either nor do I take anything that is my choice but it does happen.But since we have a case here in my hometown i might reconsider taking some.we thought that the person had visited Mexico but apparently its DR.I know that the West Nile virus existe and I'n not to worried about it. We just have to be aware that its out there.
"I gave blood right before I left...for that very reason. Didn't like the idea of being turned away in the future. So, at least you'll be able to squeeze in 2, maybe 3 donations in a year, depending on how often you get to PC. That's 300% better than most folks. Pat yourself on the back."
In the UK we have an MRSA/C.Diff epidemic in our Hospitals which is often covered up but affects tens if not hundreds of thousands.I'm far more frightened of going in one of our own Hospitals than catching Malaria in the DR - honest!snooks.
"All the resorts have good spraying programs, but the truth of the matter is that malari is endemic to the rgion. There have been 3 reported cases in the last two years, now consider some 2 million visitors each year, odds are pretty low. In more than 20 trips I have seen no more than a dozen mossies.It is a must for the PHAC and CDC to post alerts when one of their citizens contracts malaria, but these a Level 1 alerts.So consult your physician and do as they tell you, take no advice from non professionals on the forums."
"Gotta agree with hlywud again. This is the kind of advice you should seek from a physician who knows you, your medical history and can give you sound medical advice. Nobody else should tell you what to do when it comes to your personal health.Hope you have a safe and happy trip."
Well some decisions you have to make yourself. Like White Water Rafting or Skydiving which probably have a much higher risk factor than catching Malaria in the DR.Most Doctors will want to cover themselves and of course will tell you to take preventative meds but only you can weigh up your own risks as with 'Dangerous' Sports.Doctors are only human too.snooks
"Hi SnookyHear what your saying. I personally would not ask my doc if I should go White Water Rafting. But someone who has a medical history might want to clear something like that with their physician. As for Maleria, my doc says no need and I trust her judgement. But she knows me, my health needs and my history. This is why I trust her. Maybe someone else, who has a bad heart of kidneys or whatever, might have different needs than me. Only their doc will be able to advise them on these things.But you are absolutely correct in that we all have to make our own decisions based on what risk we want to assume as individuals.By the way, I work in a US hosp and we have the MRSA issues to contend with as well. I live in an area that has a high record of occurence and now we are fighting community aquired MRSA. What a mess!Thanks for your insights."
