Thank you!
"Thank you for the information and links DH!Cleaning is also important, but is just a first step. Disinfecting with chemicals that will kill germs and bacteria is imperative. Here is a link that lists the chemicals/products that will kill SARS COV-2 the cause of COVID 19>epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinf…"
"P.S. The link in post #4 will bring you to a chart. The list of chemicals that will kill the human coronavirus begins on page 9. There is over 100 chemicals listed, which also includes there commercial product name."
Thank You for the info!
"All good information. Thank you! ChicagoBear, that chart of chemicals is most helpful indeed. Certainly widens the array of products available -- especially when rubbing alcohol and hand sanitiser are sold out. I've resorted to perfectly good moonshine, but with the liquor stores closed here, I'm glad for new options!"

"I can't find confirmation anywhere that the borders are closed to incoming flights until the new date of the 8th, can anybody confirm? We had a flight scheduled (which i'm NOT taking for obvious reasons), i'm just wondering about that detail because I want my flight to get cancelled before I request a refund with the airline. Thanks!"

"Sara, what is your airline/flight? Some airlines have cancelled all flights into the Bahamas until May 1 or similar. Chances are, you flight is already cancelled if it falls in that range. Have you looked online at the airline's website to see if they have a specific Bahamas alert?"
It’s through American. Yes I’ve checked and as of yesterday it was not cancelled. I’ll keep checking.
"Sara S, this is copied from yesterday's (March 30) US Embassy in Nassau's alert -- I realise these only cover outboard flight TO the US from the Bahamas, but I'd imagine the airlines are taking it day by day depending on what the Bahamas government does. As of now, our ""lockdown"" has been extended to April 8. Depending on your date of travel, you may just need to keep checking back. I'm assuming that you're largely waiting to see American cancel the flight, or you'd have to settle fro credit as opposed to a refund. That seems to be the strategy for many. Good luck! ""American Airlines canceled all flights to the United States through April 6.Delta Airlines canceled all flights to the United States through May 1.Southwest Airlines canceled all flights to the United States through April 30. United Airlines and JetBlue ​announced they have tentative plans to schedule limited flights for the rest of the month, with United flying only to Newark and JetBlue flying only to Ft. Lauderdale. Note: The availability of flights to the United States continues to diminish and has the potential to cease at any moment and without notice due to a lack of passenger volume and due to the restrictions now in effect on incoming international flights. Please check directly with the airlines. If you are a U.S. citizen in The Bahamas and you need to return to the United States, we urge you to leave now. U.S. citizens who choose to remain in The Bahamas should prepare to do so for an indefinite period of time."""
"Thank you Dusty, this is very helpful. My hunch is that AA is not marking flights as cancelled until it's 72 hours prior. This strategy would alleviate calls to their customer service, which I know they cannot handle."
My family of four was supposed to fly to ELH today through ATL on Delta (basic economy). We had decided a few weeks ago that we wouldn’t make the trip and canceled our rental arrangements but waited on the airline bookings. On Monday I saw on the US Embassy website for the Bahamas that there were no incoming flights and the only outgoing flights were on JetBlue and Silver so I called Delta. I got through almost immediately and was told that all incoming/outgoing flights were cancelled and she said a supervisor would handle refunds for us. I haven’t received the refunds yet but I did receive a refund for a canceled 3/29 Delta flight out of Jackson Hole on 3/30. My heart goes out to everyone who has been affected by this pandemic and pray that it does not reach Eleuthera or the out islands.
Thank you DH for the link to the embassy website. Very helpful!
Stay safe everyone!!!youtu.be/3y51WWrYodI
