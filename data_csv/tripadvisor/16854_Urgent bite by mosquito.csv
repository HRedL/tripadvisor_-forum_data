"Hi,Currently in Dalat, my girlfriend has been bite by a mosquito...I'm a bit anxious, regarding all I red about Vietnam's mosquitos....We did do recommended vaccines, except for Japanese Ancephalite...We slept only in 4-5 stars hotel, HCMC and Dalat so far - what are the risks ? How can I be sure it is not a dangerous bite ? What ca we do ?Please help me :("
The odds of it being malaria or dengue are rare. Encephalitis is rarer still. Anyway it is too late now so don't worry about it.
Is there any way to be 100% sure ? I found an hospital near Da Lat.
"I have been bit many, many times whilst in Vietnam. It is what it is and no different than getting bit from mosquitos at home that carry west Nile or Zika.I wouldn't worry and allow it to impede your vacation.I should also mention that I will not use deet or bug spray unless I'm getting surrounded and bombarded by the critters. Finally, it doesn't matter about the rating of a hotel, mosquitos don't discriminate based upon the rating of a hotel!!"
"No way to be 100% sure. All going well she will be fine. There is a good chance she may get bitten again ! I have been here 10yrs and have never heard of any foreigners getting malaria, Not saying it doesn't happen but it must be very rare. Dengue fever is the one you have to watch out for. I have had it and many others also. Very unpleasant but not life threatening for a healthy person. You can have a blood test for that."
"If she gets Dengue it could be a mild flue like symptom or a hospital admittance!I have had 2 strains of Dengue over 30 years of visiting SE Asia but I have been bitten by mosquitoes every single day/night every trip.Dont panic!!! mosquitoes bite people all the time lol, its only if they bite an infected person they pick up dengue from them and pass it on.Malaria? who knows! Zika is a total bull crap storm in a tea cup.Are you sure its mossie bites and not ""bed bugs"" :(Edited: 3 years ago "

"Thanks for your replies !I do feel much better. Plus, I now do think it's a spider bite (2 holes where the bite is).We were in HCMC before Da Lat, but she had no mark before the 2nd day here.However, we will go back to HCMC very soon... We will be double careful !!"
"We get bitten on occasion when in Vietnam, nothing to worry about, continue to use repellent and spray your room with flyspray as a preventative. I would worry more if I was bitten by a spider than a mosquito."

"This is Asia, you are likely to be bitten by something, no matter how careful you are! Relax - take the usual preventative precautions with a DEET spray, but don't panic over something over which you have no control. If you can still see the dots where she was bitten, then likely it's not a mossie."
"Nothing to do with the continent Asia....it is about Zika. Its about being careful if you are pregnant or likely to become pregnant. The advice is, if you are pregnant or likely to become pregnant then you should avoid areas that have cases of Zika. South Vietnam has 212 cases reported in January. Its everyone's own choice if they feel like its a risk that is slight and worth taking fair enough. If they don't, fair enough. But please give everyone the right to the correct information."
"Zika ""storm in a tea cup"" nobody had even heard of it a year ago! bit like the Ebola epidemic or epidemic ""not"" lol"
"Yes you said that once already, it is on a website and this morning in British Newspapers and being ripped apart as we speak.. Ebola of course had no reported cases in Vietnam, but 11,000 deaths in Africa. Zika completely different has 212 cases reported as of 2 days ago, and is extremely dangerous to unborn babies."
I've just returned from Vietnam and I counted at least 16 bites on me at one point (and I was covered in bug spray!) some of them looked bruised and nasty but not one of them lasted more than a couple of days. Don't panic :)
"Good, if you do get pregnant in the next few months and haven't been tested, it might be wise to. Too late by then, but there we go. The problem is, all the 212 cases have been mild symptoms. If you are not thinking about pregnancy then excellent. But I agree don't panic, but be aware if you are considering pregnancy. If not... crack on."
