"Anyone having any luck with their cancel for any reason trip insurance claims? Ours excludes epidemics (of course) but claimed it would cover anything including ""my dog will miss me too much"". Trying to decide, if we cancel, if it's worth trying to make a claim or take the refund in cost."
If it doesn't include epidemics then you have no claim. If those exclusions are clearly stated in the terms and conditions it will be a waste of time to try to fight it.Donna
"I purchase a Travel Insured policy with a cancel for any reason rider every year. I have only had to use it once, and the process was seamless--I was refunded 75% of airfare. I don't understand your question exactly (what does take the refund in cost mean?), but if you can reschedule with a minor fee, I would do that over take the 25% loss (plus cost of policy). I will likely be unable to reschedule the trip I have planned for May, so if things are bad enough that I cancel, I will be getting my 75%."
"How do they know why one is canceling if you just request to cancel? I know you usually only get back 75% of what has been paid out for the trip at the time you cancel but, how would they know why if the reason is not stated?I find it hard to believe all such companies selling this sort of travel insurance is simply going to assume every single person is canceling due to the virus.Unless I am missing something?Edited: 11:04 am, March 04, 2020 "
"Please share the name of the company so we'll know who says ""cancel for any reason"" but does not really mean it. Travel Insured has a FAQ on their page about the coronavirus, and as long as you purchase the policy within 21 days of initial trip payment (which they verify when you purchase a policy) and cancel more than 48 hours before travel, you can take ""cancel for any reason"" at its word. These stipulations are spelled out when you purchase the policy several times."
"If it said cancel for any reason and the policy itself didn't state ""certain reasons are exempt"", sue them.Edited: 11:30 am, March 04, 2020 "
"The policy is through Allianz Global. We paid $280 and they are currently offering refunds on the premium if you cancel and do not file a claim. The policy states ""Any unforeseeable reason, not otherwise covered, affecting you that would cause a reasonable person to cancel their trip. Reimbursements for losses under this covered reason are limited to 80% of actual losses"". There are exclusions (so not really cancel for ANY reason) of: Any loss or event that was known, foreseeable, intended, or expected when your policy was purchased;2. Your intentional self-harm or if you attempt or commit suicide;3. A criminal act resulting in a conviction, except when you, a traveling companion, or a family member isthe victim of such act;4. An epidemic;5. Acts committed with the intent to cause loss;6. Air, water, or other pollution, or the threat of a pollutant release, including thermal, biological, andchemical pollution or contamination;7. Nuclear reaction, radiation, or radioactive contamination;8. War (declared or undeclared), acts of war, military disciplinary action, or mobilization under the WarPowers Act;9. Terrorist events, civil disorder or unrest, except as expressly covered under Trip Cancellation Coverage;10. Acts, travel alerts/bulletins, or prohibitions by any government or public authority, except as expresslycovered under Trip Cancellation Coverage; or11. Any travel supplierâ€™s complete cessation of operations due to financial condition, with or without filingfor bankruptcy, except as expressly covered under Trip Cancellation Coverage.As 4 is epidemic I'm wondering if there is any point in even trying to make a claim as our main reason - my husband is not allowed to travel by his work without a whole list of consequences - stems from the epidemic."
"Thank you for sharing the extra information. It is helpful for future travelers as well as people mired in this year's mess.I would file anyway, but stress the employer aspect. So, your reason is not the epidemic per se (and it has not officially been named an epidemic)--the reason is your employer's stance on the matter. You need not even mention the virus but instead focus on the employer's new policy.I hope a lot of these companies go out of business--those that are fair will certainly be rewarded with future business!"
"not sure what your total trip cost was and your age etc. but $280 is not a very high premium for ""cancel for any reason"" insurance...and most reports are that those with that type of coverage are getting reimbursed for up to 75%. I buy from that company often and premiums for a typical 2 week trip for ""cancel for any reason"" are much much higher. I do not buy it but usually price it out."
"""Cancel for any reason"" coverage is typically a add-on to a policy that has standard cancellation coverage for things like illness or a death in the family. So, you will see a list of exclusions in your policy. The reason why you cancel will typically make a difference as to the level of coverage. You'll get a bigger refund if you cancel for a covered reason (subject to the list of exclusions) versus cancelling for any reason.Have you reached out to the company to ask if they will cover you?"
"Based on your additional post you still have no claim. Your employer is putting restrictions on you due to the epidemic, not due to some other reason. Also, number 10 mentions travel alerts and prohibitions so you cannot claim that as a legitimate reason either. Of course, you can always file and see if they'll pay but don't be surprised if they refuse the claim. Donna"
