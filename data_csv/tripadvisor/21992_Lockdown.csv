"Are over 70's allowed to travel to parks and beaches, with the rules since 11th may,thanks for any replies."
"Elaine, your guess is as good as ours. In theory those who live in England and NI may travel for exercise and may have 'limited socialising in open spaces' - how's that for clarity.After Boris's speech and 60 pages of Our Plan to Rebuild, few to no people have any idea what is allowed. As to those over 70, considering them as one large group isn't advisable as there will be a range of healthy and less healthy persons throughout.In the short term if you'd like to go for a walk for some fresh air then do so, keeping physical distance when possible."
"The people with serious health conditions who are shielding for 12 weeks should continue to do so. Healthy over 70s can go out following the same rules as younger people but are reminded to be extra carefulEdited: 4:34 pm, May 12, 2020 "
"Where are you travelling from?A local park or beach, yes, subject to certain conditions."
"I looked at both the PHE and NHS websites and they're saying that ""people in 'vulnerable groups' should continue to take care"". Vulnerable groups are over 70s and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart conditions, chronic kidney disease, liver disease such as hepatitis, Parkinson's, MS, motor nurone disease, cerebral palsy, have a condition that means they have a higher risk of getting infections, are taking nedcines that can affe ct the immune system such as low doses of steroids, are very obese with a a BMI over 40, pregnant women, have a lung condition that's not severe such as COPD, asthma, emphysema or bronchitis.These groups are called ""clinically vulnerable"" and ""it's very important that you follow the advice about staying at home to avoid Corona Virus. This means you should only leave your home for things like getting food and medicine and exercising once a day"".Hope that helps!"
I walk around the manor keeping a social distance most days.
"Elaine,You can't generalise.Many over 70s are in better shape than many younger folks, who may be overweight,unfit, and smokers as well.Stay alert seems to me to be a pretty good slogan."
"Baroness Altmann (a previous pensions minister and pension theft campaigner ) in interviews last week, was emphatic that being over 70 does not automatically equal vulnerable. I think I heard her say this to Nick Ferrari on LBC as well. Lord David Blunkett 72, former politician and blind since birth was scathing and said any incarceration for over 70s was discrimination and an outrageEdited: 5:38 pm, May 12, 2020 "

Elaine...you are allowed to travel to public places like parks or beaches where if you choose you can meet up with one person or sunbath or whatever as long as you a) keep 2 meters between yourself and anyone elseAnd b) dont use public transport to get to your destination Obviously if you feel nervous don't go

Yes I am ...Anthony K
"""yes I am...."" but Anthony you are not over 70 so how does that answer the question?"
Suggest you read the 50 page documentRegarding healthy over 70s it states -Stay at home as much as possible. If you go out take particular care to minimise contact with others outside your household
Only you can answer that. It really depends upon your current and past state of health since Boris doesn’t know. You have to decide upon the facts.
"The link in #10 shows that being over 70 means the *advice* is to take extra care and to stay at home as much as possible, but even then there is nothing that says because you are over 70 there are some things you definitely should not do at all. It’s only if you are in the extra-vulnerable “shielded” group where the advice is still to isolate as far as possible.The OP does, however, ask about being “allowed”. The *rules*, as set out in the various regulations, have never distinguished between under and over 70s on movement, and they still don’t. So you are “allowed” to do whatever anyone else in England can do, on the assumption that both you and your destination are English. I know others disagree, but one of the eye-openers for me has been how quickly most people in the U.K. have accepted that we can be told what to do by the government and are then obliged to do it regardless of whether they have put it into law."
"Astolat is quite right. It has never been anything other than advice for the healthy over 70s. In fact, even those with severe health conditions (who are not necessarily elderly) have only been advised to shield for 12 weeks. There is no law that says they have to shield and I've no doubt that some of them have gone against the advice."
"I am staying indoors or in my garden 23 hours out of 24 and some days when I am active in the garden I never leave my property at all.I am not doing that because the government told me to do that I am doing it because I don’t trust the government to deal with this We have seen so many mixed messages There are several performance indicators such as Provision of PPETesting Timing of lockdownTracking and TracingCommunicationSo that’s just 5 things And the government have not performed satisfactorily in any of them .So for me I am fit and healthy and approaching 70 and I intend to keep it that way by Staying away from people and staying at home But respect to those who have to go out and face the risk of infection without the confidence they deserveEdited: 3:46 am, May 13, 2020 "
"Re 12, Sherlock. I am 68 ... but I can and if I were 70+ I could.Thank-you Robert."
"I don’t see the difference between somebody the day before their 70 th birthday and the day after it, in the absence of other risk factors. Summaries of the law And media reports oversimplify - you have to go back to the legal text if you really want to know. But if you are acting reasonably, distancing etc, I don’t think anybody will question you unless you look massively over 70. ."
"Please will people stop calling them ""rules"". They are guidelines. The Police College has issued an official document outlining how the pandemic is to be policed in England and Wales as of today. In no part of the document is there any reference to people over 70. So you can do exactly the same as anyone else. https://www.college.police.uk/What-we-do/COV…"
"If you're 95 and socially distancing correctly, why would anyone question you? You wouldn't be doing anything you're not allowed to. Not that I'm encouraging people to take risks. I'm in the (very) healthy over 70s group and,while I go out walking every day, I haven't been shopping and don't intend to for the foreseeable future."
I've been trying to maintain my fitness levels. I will walk if there aren't too many cars on the road to make it dangerous to do so.It's a balance between mental and physical health. While very fit before I find lethargy keeps me from exercise I could do more often.The problem will be keeping a distance now as footpaths are narrow and if roads are busy you can't step away.So I will take the next week to quietly find out what is safe but spend most of the time at home still.
"Now, Blackpool and other seaside towns are asking people not to visit.https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may…“None of the traditional attractions that you want to see will be open, you won’t be able to get the food you usually get, or do the things you can normally do.” - Simon Blackburn, Leader of Blackpool Council."
"My OH is 71 and has been going out to the park every day with the dog. He has been walking but is intending to travel to a larger park/ wood area perhaps tomorrow to go on a longer walk ( dog needs a lot of exercise so we have taken turns ) His walks have been more than an hour a day but he has met few people and has been 2m away from other walkers of course. I think if you live near a beach or park then there is nothing wrong with doing that but there won't be any facilities open. But certainly only go if they are fairly local , not like the idiots who think it is ok to go upto the Lakes or Blackpool. They don't want people like that who don't have common sense."
"The only people who have been given different ""rules"" are those considered extremely vulnerable , not just vulnerable. The extremely vulnerable have received letters from the NHS asking them not to go out at all.Others, those over 70 and/or those with health conditions which make them vulnerable, but not extremely vulnerable, are recommended to go out as little as possible. There are not, however, any rules for them other than those which apply to the rest of the population.I am 72 and tick a number of the health boxes (but have not received ""the letter""). I have been working remotely, but near the end of June I have some work coming up that cannot be done remotely. I haven't seen anything that would prevent me from doing my job, albeit with as much social distancing as can be managed.I look forward to the return of the sun and the new permission to sit out in it and read a book on my Kindle."
"My wife is on the extremely vulnerable list and has not been outside the house or garden since March 15th. Where that leaves me is a grey area but, to protect her, I virtually never go out except in extreme cases. Yesterday, for example, I had to take the cat to the vets and today or tomorrow, dv, I will go back to bring him home."

"I hope everyone is well and healthy.I’m trying to read British media sources, but they’re all about speculations, etc.Any sign of the end of lockdown in U.K.? How far are you from reaching Green Country status?Thank you.Yuri."
Don't hold your breath.
The next planned relaxation of restrictions is due on 1 June when it is anticipated that some Schools will reopen as well as non essential shops.The reopening of Schools is a very contentious issue which there seems to be very little appetite for outside of the government so it will be interesting to see how that pans.Apart from that little has changed since the relaxation of restrictions last week. I think though there is a growing feeling that a lot of people have now decided for themselves that the lockdown is over and that they can return to doing what they did before. I noticed in the Guardian today that a poll had been done on whether people where still adhering to the restrictions. The findings were that less than 60% now are with the chief culprits being the under 30’s.
Thank you. Are they planning to prolong the school year into the Summer?Yuri.
"No Yuri, not at the moment. The plan is only for 6 year olds & 11 year olds to go back at the moment. Some schools are even discouraging this."
"Thank you. I have to know what I can do about them flights to MAN on 16.7? If UK won’t reach status of Green country by then, we won’t be able to travel.Yuri."
"YuriEven if you have the opportunity to visit the UK, in July, you must determine whether or not you would wish to quarantine yourself, here, for fourteen days on arrival.My glass is, still, half-full.Anthony K"
"Shulem Anthony,I think you’ve missed the essence of my post. Green Countries are the countries I won’t have to stay in mandatory 14 days long quarantine upon return to Israel. Unfortunately, as for now UK isn’t in the list of such countries.It will be some day eventually. The question is when? Is there a chance for the goal to be achieved by the middle of July?Yuri."
"Yuri, I think the point Antony was making was that the UK is (apparently) quite close to announcing 14 day quarantine for international arrivals, with (reportedly) no exceptions."
I wouldn’t want any exceptions. I wouldn’t wish to risk it in any way also.There’re almost 2 months ahead of us. Let’s hope things will get better in your country too.Yuri.
"<< Any sign of the end of lockdown in U.K.? >> it will be a 'long' way away, Yuri.I think your opportunity of flying to MAN on 16 July is quite low.In July - (1) There's a fair chance you would have to quarantine in Manc for 14 days on arrival and (2) probably another 14 day quarantine on arrival from UK back home.That's my best guess, but things can change rapidly even though UK has a long way to go with this virus situation.

"KWUK, thank you. Keep on holding on in lockdown. IIRC, both you and me went into self isolation simultaneously. You - on behalf of British authorities recommendation and common sense. Me - being told by Israeli government.That - instead of drinking pints, and enjoying The Who gig in Manchester Arena on March 16th! This life is full of surprises, isn’t it?Though Israel is out of lockdown almost entirely. I’m still keeping it very low key. Sea beach is only place I’m visiting regularly. Well, with 43C outside it’s necessary! Sea water is very refreshing, even if still being very cold in the beginning of the season. It’s supposed to be 24C, but it feels like Loch Lomond!Yuri."
"Yes, I repeatedly measure timespans from that The Who gig that neither of us could enjoy, almost one of the first things to get cancelled in UK. The day afterwards was the start of when I changed all normalities, and very little has altered since then."

Re 44Remember Nelson Mandela & Terry Waite ... in our lifetimes ...Anthony K
"Rojblake. I’m glad to see you posting. It means that you’re alright.In my neck of the woods, all the news about scientific discoveries became headline topics. There’re many more ways to to overcome this virus than Vaccine per se. Many remarkably smart people are working on solutions as we type. I’m certain they’ll find the way.Yuri."
What other ways than vaccine?Curious as to what might be worked on.Can't see a link with Nelson Mandela and Terry Waite.
"It's hard enough to get enough people to take a vaccine that has been rigorously tested and used for many years with total success. I'll normally take anything going, but even I won't be rushing to be first in the queue for any vaccine that turns up any time soon, unless it's one that has been around for years for some other purpose. And I imagine if such a thing existed they would have found it by now."
"'What other ways than vaccine? Curious as to what might be worked on.' Antivirals as an alternative treatment modality.In the last couple of months there have been people on these forums and elsewhere claiming there will 'never be a vaccine' and by extension we are doomed, with mention made of the common cold and HIV. There are about 150+ viruses which cause the former and as it's usually a mild illness work on a vaccine for each of those viruses would be an expensive exercise for a minuscule outcome.HIV is another matter. There are quite a few antiretrovirals which are very effective in controlling the illness. I've a dear friend who's taken part in several clinical trials and has been on ARVs for perhaps 30 years. His viral load is nil and has been for years.It's a toss up as to what will be found first to have better safety and efficacy for treatment of this rotten little virus, an antiviral medication or a vaccine. Work is being done at remarkable speed given the usual manner of development of new treatments, and like others I hope for a result as soon as possible."
I know plenty of over 70's going for 40+ mile bike rides.I know plenty of 20 year old's who couldn't mage a 4 mile bike ride.Use common sense.
Thanks TravellerPlus for that explanation.Hopefully we have something to control the virus in some way sooner rather than later.

You probably know about device that can smell pregnancy in cows? It’s been altered lately. Covid molecules do have recognizable smell.

The Guardian Online is also running with the Dominic Cummings story.
"I would expect the Conservative supporting papers will no want to lead off with the outrage on this story. They might have to join in, depending on how they see the public mood. Cummings might have to be sacrificed quite quickly for the good of the party. Then the PM can be portrayed as a strong leader with the right principles.And then, without Cummings acting as a special advisor or whatever it's called, perhaps the decision being made by government might possibly start to improve."

I'll be very surprised if this story turns out to be false.
I just did a very quick check. There are 3 Conservavtive MPs that I have been able to find that have contracted covid19. So with 365 Tory MPs you are more than twice as likely to contract Covid19 as one of the riff raff in the population as a whole. Seems to me the people of Devon and Cornwall should be more worried if a Conservative MP turns up in the South West.
"Rees-Mogg clearly think the number of Conservative MP's who caught the virus isn't high enough, and he also want MP's from all other parties to fall ill as well. That's the only reason I can think of for insisting that they all return to the House of Commons."
"Where do the guidelines say this ""The PM's chief aide Dominic Cummings acted in line with guidelines when he went from London to Durham with his sick wife to be near relatives during the coronavirus lockdown, says No 10.A spokesman said it was ""essential"" for Mr Cummings to ensure he had childcare if he also became unwell.Also it seems the police were involved ""Police said they attended a property in County Durham, after the Guardian and the Daily Mirror newspapers first reported Mr Cummings had made the trip.""https:/…uk-politics-52782913"
"Just to add, I misread the report and it was his wife who was suspected of being infected not himself. Shouldn't he have self isolated for 2 weeks as he had been in conctact with a his wife who may have had the virus?"
"""Shouldn't he have self isolated for 2 weeks as he had been in conctact with a his wife who may have had the virus?""You have to understand he is not like us ordinary people.""We"" are very obviously not all in this together, at least this sort of behaviour makes that abundantly clear."

"If he doesn't resign, he has to be sacked! Stupid arrogant fool."
"My son and daughter in law are ‘essential’. In normal times childcare is 50% nursery ,50% ‘grannycare’ . We all felt that this was increasing the risk for the grannies ( both still under 70) and , as a doc, DiL thought it would be setting a bad example to people who knew her and was against the guidance as I would have had to travel during lockdown. Grandchild has had the extra days in nursery. This has meant that they’ve had to pay double for childcare so that she could carry on working as a (relatively) junior doc in the NHS. Her husband works in child protection. Also means, of course, that I haven’t seen them.Angry? Doesn’t begin to describe my feelings towards this government. They disgust me.

It’s perhaps not surprising that they apparently know no one in London who likes them enough to collect a few groceries and leave them on the doorstep.

">>>people like Matt Hancock and Rishi Sunak now look like utter toadies.<<<There is a lot of truth in saying they look like toadies. Those in cabinet are only there because they supported Johnson, didn't try to delay Brexit, or simply can't be trusted on the back benches. For me, Sunak and Hancock fall into the first to categories.Cummings' position is now untenable. As with Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland and Dr Calderwood, the PM will discover that the people are very angry about Cummings breaking the governments own rules.

"After this, maybe he will need to self isolate until everyone's forgotten all about him, lol!"
Watching someone called Dan Hodges on the BBC and if I heard it right he said that Cummings had not broken any laws because the stay at home rules were not forceful by law.

"Yes, I ""believe"" I'm 6 foot tall and shaped like a supermodel but oops what a surprise it's not actually true..."
"Mr Cummings when questioned by the non-distancing press-pack outside his home replied that it was ""about doing the right thing""The right thing for whom?We have been given guidance (coupled with some rules) that we should all be doing the right thing for the greater good of the country. Does Mr Cummings believe his actions were in tune with that or was he doing the right thing for his family but potentially putting others at risk?"
He was also potentially putting his own immediate and extended family at risk by travelling that far. It wasn't the 'right thing' by any definition that I know of that phrase.His arrogance is almost unbelievable.
"I would like him to explain what he means by ""the right thing"". I don't think what he did fits that description but he presumably does.Edited: 2:09 pm, May 23, 2020 "
He was behind the original plan to get herd immunity and probably that to release patients into care homes without testing
I wonder how many other parents could have done what CUmmings did and travelled hundreds of miles to visit family just in case they couldn't look after their own child between them?And what would have the outcome been for the country if they had done it?I also think about the single parent households who must have struggled a lot more than the Cummings family at various times in the recent weeks.
And you can bet they didn't do a 250 mile car trip with a 4-year-old without stopping at least once for a bathroom break.
"I seen arguments defending his actions saying that the four year old could ""hold it in"" for the duration of the trip."
A four and a half hour drive? That 4-year-old would need a bladder of stone. Or a nappy.

"I think that Nicola Sturgeon had to back down once it became clear how angry people were about what had happened. I don't know if that anger was intensified because it happened twice rather once. It might have, but the British don't like being told what to do if those doing the telling don't do the same.At the end of the day, Cummings is seen as being part of the government that has stopped ordinary people doing things, so he can't expect people to say ""Oh well, that's fine, poor Dominic being hounded by the nasty old press""."
"""Unless, of course, he disagreed with the lockdown from the start""As the ultimate Darwinian libertarian I have no doubt that is indeed what he thought...and almost certainly still thinks. Survival of the fittest is his motto and up yours. His contempt for us ordinary people is clear."

"A thought: could this be a 'pay no attention to the debacle behind the curtain' moment with the squalid little oik Cummings being used as a ploy from Boris's johnson not being kept in his kecks? The IOPC have decided that Johnson won't face any further action for potential criminal activity which should have been of rather more interest, but Dom's idiocy has proven a handy distraction. (disingenuously) Wouldn't it be rather good if someone were to demonstrate thoughtfulness and capability in Westminster these days? Imagine the rumblings if that were to occur."
"Re Dominic Cummings .. see Johnson, Jenrick, Elizabeth & Philip, Charlie, Kinnock (S,) not to mention Calderwood and Ferguson. Anthony K"
Definitely don't need to mention the last two as they resigned their posts.I can recall when younger I used to read newspapers and find stories interesting. Now I wonder how much if any is true and spend far too much time trying to find alternative sources..
The worst thing about the Cummings episode is that the government is willing to undermine its entire public health strategy during a pandemic to excuse the actions of a single advisor! If Bojo does sack Cummings it will be the first time in history a dummy has sacked a ventriloquist!
">>> If Bojo does sack Cummings it will be the first time in history a dummy has sacked a ventriloquist! <<<A round of applause for Matt please, superb ;-)"
">>> Yes, I ""believe"" I'm 6 foot tall and shaped like a supermodel but oops what a surprise it's not actually true... <<<Not true for me either, I'm only 5 foot 10."
I think we should all go outside our front doors on Monday night at 8pm and boo for Cummings!
Let's just clap at 5pm today if Boris manages to grow a spine in the next 20 minutes and sacks him.
"I am all for it, sooner the better. The whole cabinet is a total shambles."
"Here we go, so it's OK to travel for the 'right kind' of child care, thanks Boris.Hopefully the journos who broke this story are now ready to release round 3 of their investigation."

Modern proverbs - The road to Durham is paved with good intentions.Anthony K
"That's quite clever, Anthony, like it:)"
I have just written to my MP telling him Cummings must be sackedSuggest you all do the same
"I think it's ridiculous to declare that Dominic Cummings has single handedly overthrown lockdown. It's been obvious that slavish adherence to the rules has been breaking down over the last 2 weeks. I bet 99% of the population either don't know who Dominic Cummings is, or don't care, and will carry on doing as they always intended, whether that's staying in or going out. I have no respect for any politician of any party; they are all in it for the power trip and vanity. They are as flawed as anyone, if not more. I'm certainly not naive enough to expect them to be whiter than white. Whether or not Boris publicly sacks Mr Cummings, he's not going anywhere. He will still be running things in the background. A public apology or acknowledgment will be just as meaningless. It's a completely pointless waste of energy getting so riled up, but I guess lots of people have nothing better to do with their time right now."
"Marshmellow,Whilst I agree that Cummings can pretty much carry on doing what he wants (he is clearly a psychopath) I do disagree as to the importance of whether he should be sacked.I suspect a lot more people than you think are aware of this (it has been the lead story for days in the media) and support for him seems to be limited to a couple of back benchers and a few cabinet ministers who have been told what to say....probably by Cummings himself.The importance is that the second most important person in the country (arguably the most important) at the moment broke if not the regulations then most certainly the spirit of the regulations. When even the right wing press say he was stupid at best and that his actions will lead to people ignoring the regulations then you know that public opinion is against you.And this isn't about politics, it's about doing what is right."
"I think the public have certainly been on the lookout for ways to rebel, certainly as the weather heats up.Hypocritical behaviour by those in power provides a great excuse to do that.If he'd been disciplined or sacked, it would have at least said ""we take our own rules seriously""."
"Anyway, it looks like the police, as well as God (CofE bishops) are on the case, so his soul will be under scrutiny now, as well as the CCTV. :-)"
"Listening to BBC 5Live this morning and they had someone phone in defending Cummings. The presenter said to him that it's a long drive from London to Durham and surely that Cummings would have had to stop for a toilet break. The response from the guy phoning in: ""Well I sleep for 8 hours every night and I don't need the toilet during that time"".Eh? Is this guy suggesting that Cummings drove from London to Durham while he was asleep and, therefore, wouldn't have needed a toilet break!? Anyway, I'm just going to print this off and then hop on the train to Durham!https:/…1"
"I can't even begin to think how it would be possible to defend Cummings. Even with his usual huffing and puffing bluster yesterday evening, Johnson couldn't make a decent stab at it."
"Who is actually Cummings' employer? If he was sacked could he claim wrongful dismissal? He hasn't actually been charged with any offence, and if he was I wouldn't say it was a given that he'd be found guilty. Could anyone in the country be sacked for doing the same thing?For me it's not so much what he did, but what else should have happened. For someone in a job like his he really should be thinking as to what the reaction would be when it was discovered what he'd done. If I'd been in his shoes I suspect I would have wanted to do what he did, but the first thing I would have done is told my boss. If he actually reports to the PM, and he was in hospital, then tell someone else. If they say no, I've a decision to make, but I expect to get sacked. If they say yes, then we discuss whether to make it public, but it's no longer my responsibility.And I really don't understand anyone who sees how this justifies them making unauthorised journeys themselves. It's not even ""If your friend jumped off a bridge, would you?"". It's ""If some odious bloke you don't know put his family and others in danger, would you?"""
"The apologists are saying that his child is autistic, meaning he had to be near familiar people if his parents were incapacitated.It beggars belief that the first course of action was not to ask the mother/sister to come to London, if they were truly the only people the child was comfortable around.Add in the mother's/wife's birthdays, multiple trips etc and that excuse is more on the nose than a fish market at closing time.(Dewy, I suspect people who were already sceptical of the lockdown and not in high-risk categories are the ones who would actually use this as an excuse to change their own behaviour.)Edited: 7:34 am, May 25, 2020 "

"i.e. ignore the government advice, do what you think it's the best...is his advice."
"If Cummings can interpret the lockdown regulations as he sees fit, then anyone else should be able do so as well, but most of us haven’t.. We’ve done what we were told to do, or not to do....I’ve a very old relative , who i would have loved to go and see, stay with in their large property, and look after, observing social distancing .. he lives about the same distance from me as Durham is from Cummings’ London residence,,, but I didn’t, because we have obeyed the lockdown rules to the letter..I’ve a friend who lost her father a few weeks ago, but was told by HM Government that I shouldn’t visit her to offer some support. He didn’t have , or die from, Covid19, yet she wasn’t allowed to see even see him and hold his hand in his final hours when he was dying of cancer .I’ve not been able to attend the funerals of village neighbours, or go to church, even for private prayer, I can take a lot.. , food shortages, closure of hotels, hairdressers, pubs, bars, spas, put up with deprivation of liberty for a long time for the greater good, as indeed millions of people have done.. If not gladly, then reasonably willingly, but what I can’t stand from Cummings is snivelling, self -serving, arrogant hypocrisy..It stinks."
"Quotes from Dom: 'It says that in some circumstances you won’t be able to follow the rules and it seems to me that I was in such an exceptional circumstance and I was trying to balance all these very complicated things.' Translation: me, me, me, me.'I don’t regret what I did and as I said, I think reasonable people may well disagree about how I thought about what to do in those circumstances but I think what I did was actually reasonable.' Me, me, me.'I’ve seen some of the media over the last couple of days, and I’m not surprised that a lot of people are very angry. I hope and think that today, when I’ve actually explained all the circumstances about it, I think people realise this is a very complicated, tricky situation.' If I say it often enough it will become true. I am Dom and I crush all others before me.'In the circumstances, with a small child, it doesn’t go into lots of different circumstance and say what to do. There is no regulation covering the situation I found myself in.' Back to me, me, me, with the added fillip of I will do as I please and everyone else can feckk right off.He is a sociopath, and like another well known one they do not recognise this as they have neither empathy nor insight. What's unfortunate is that they hold positions of strength and as such can't be ignored or avoided and that their actions can affect others - not that they'll give a toss. That anyone is defending him is abysmal behaviour on their part."
"Agreed, arrogant b'stard."

"I posted the other day that I hoped Mr Cummings would explain himself.He has now done that. His only regret, it seems, is not making a statement earlier.Having read a transcript of the press conference and Q&A my opinion is he is even less self-aware than I suspected.

One thing that hasn't been questioned is why a health professional (I think he said doctor but I could be wrong) said Cummings could go back to work given his claims that he still had eyesight issues and that he admitted to feeling sick during his stop in Barnard Castle.Strikes me that Cummings didn't tell this person the whole truth about his health or where in the country he was as surely no health professional would recommend or indeed allow him to drive 250+ miles given his symptoms at the time he claimed he spoke to this person.Mrs Hornets was in a similar position as regards feeling unwell and returning to work (although she was at home) and was told by our GP to self isolate for another 7 days.
There are a number of things that have been said that may not stand up to much scrutiny.
"Returning to London was not legal, going back to Durham to pick up the family was not legal, returning to London with the family was not legal.All Cummings and Johnson did was concoct a narrative that fitted with the reported facts. How much is true is unknown"

"I still think he will walk, too. Or Boris Johnson will be forced to get rid of him by those who have backed him up until now.The thing, is, if Cummings had apologised and shown some humility when the story broke, both he and the PM might have been able to ride it out.But there still hasn't been an apology as far as I can see. Nor any contrition or remorse. As for an understanding of what ordinary folk have gone through, well, I never expected any of that. It's not the rule breaking so much for me.

"Yes, I think that quote is the nub of it. I think there's more to it in many people's minds. There is a question mark over DC's judgement, there's the lack of any remorse about what he did including driving 15 miles to test his eyesight (can't he do that by driving around the block?).In my view he remains a dead man walking. This isn't going to go away for the government, no matter how much they might want it to."
"""Time for the lynch mob to move on. Doesn't matter if they are doing a good job or a bad one, whether we like them or not, ""A relative of the 36914 dead might disagree with you. It matters that this country has disproportionately more dead than it should have so clearly soemthing is not right and that can't be attributed to the working classes going off to the beach as many would have us believe.So yes it does matter."
"Where are you getting the idea that Britain’s death rate is “disproportionate”?66 Million Population 36,000 dead, that’s around 0.2%And yes, I know that each one of those dead is a Parent, Child, Grandparent, Brother/Sister.But let’s just stick to the actual figures and their relativity, which I am sure will take a while to be truly Analysed! Only this Morning Spain has wiped 2000 off their Death total due to a recalculation of their figures.Remember there are people dying and being buried/cremated who have not actually been tested for Covid, some death certificates are mentioning Covid without actually proving they had contracted it, equally there are more than likely there are Death Certificates being issued with no mention of Covid, but it could been a factor of death!This is where it gets on my T*ts when people start referring to League Tables! “Oh, we are third in the world” what! Is it Top of the Pops? “Hiya Pop Pickers, and down two places this week at number 5 is the UK”!It will take a year at least for analysts to crunch the numbers, only then will we see who has been telling the truth or not regarding official numbers!"
"As has been pointed out many times already, countries count deaths differently. You can't compare apples and oranges, only apples and apples. Where we include deaths in care homes and where the person had C19 symptoms, even though that wasn't the cause of death, you can't accurately compare that to a country who doesn't."
"#234 and 235. Do you seriously expect me to believe it is because good old honest Britain is the only one counting the numbers honestly. Even we aren't doing an accurate account. We are supposed to have the best health care in the World. Please explain why Germany, South Korea, Japan got it right and we got it wrong. This isn't just because we count the numbers honestly.""Time for the lynch mob to move on. Doesn't matter if they are doing a good job or a bad one, whether we like them or not, ""Yes why aren't they tested. Why were old people cleared out of hospitals into care homes without testing. Why have care homes not been helped by the government with PPE. Why have they been left to fend for themselves.The complacency of some people also gets on my t*ts. Stats are there for very good reason and boy do they show what a rubbish job Johnson is doing. Not to mention supporting the a5rse DC."

"""It's not about honesty, it's about difference. ""Thailand 3045 cases 57 deaths. What's the betting that when it comes to diving up limited vaccines Thailand gets an equal number to the UK as the populations are roughly similar. Or miraculously just before the diving up they announce mis quoting the deaths by 35000."
"I don't understand No240. Are you suggesting that countries that have been successful in reducing fatalities or cases should not get a vaccine, should it become available?"
"Look here then say whether you believe the numbers. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Personally I don't believe the numbers. Yes I am saying that countries that that demonstrate the need for the vaccine based on need, ie greatest number of cases get firts call.Why should China with a population of over 1.4 billion but only 82992 cases ( most of them in Wuhan) wouldn't grab the lion's share of the vaccines (unless they made it themselves of course).That is why I was suggesting when it came to dividing up the limited vaccines we will start to see hikes in the figures for countries like Thailand."
So your logic is that there should be a worldwide death quota and a country isn't entitled to a vaccine until enough of their citizens are dead? Wow.
Re 243 - thanks for the explanation.Sadly that is what I thought you meant.Oh well.
I guess we should now be asking what loopholes are written in to “the guidelines” if we are unable to maintain the two metres distance or not able to STAY ALERT.
I would imagine any vaccine will go first to whoever is prepared to pay the most for it.
"""Sadly that is what I thought you meant.""#245 what were you thinking of then?"
#247 Probably. The Government has already said that the 30 million doses expected in the autum if approved will not all be for the UK but not how they will be divided.
"The leader of the Oxford study was on CNN a few days ago saying that the US had bought some of them - 5 million is the figure that comes into my mind, but I might be wrong."
"""#245 what were you thinking of then?""I was think that was what you thought but at the time I read it I wasn't sure, but you clarified for me. Thanks"
"'I would imagine any vaccine will go first to whoever is prepared to pay the most for it.' Clearly this need / should / must not be the case.The pharmaceutical company(ies) that come up with a safe and reliable antiviral or vaccine will need to tread very carefully with availability of the product as anything else might be disastrous for that company as well as for governments who insist on queue-barging. The actions of the past and any greed by Big Pharma will have to be considered and bad behaviour set aside at least temporarily; I don't for a minute think Big Pharma will change their practices in the long term.On a much lighter note, I can't be the only one who has noticed a worrisome resemblance between DC and the late lamented Uncle Duke https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Duke Hunter S wasn't without flaws but I'd still rather have spent time with him than with the revolting DC."
Probably need to at least half what the government says going by their double counting of tests
"<<< 'I would imagine any vaccine will go first to whoever is prepared to pay the most for it.' Clearly this need / should / must not be the case. >>>You are probably right, but I'm not sure what will actually happen. Just suppose a Vancouver company developed the first proven vaccine. It's not going to go down very well if they say that Canada has kept the virus reasonably under control, and the vaccine would save a lot more lives in the USA. I imagine the residents of BC wouldn't want to share it even with Alberta until such time as everyone in BC had had it. And after Canada's needs were satisfied?"

And after Canada's needs were satisfied?'I'm willing to wait for others who have a greater need to receive a vaccine, much as I'd like to get back to some semblance of normality. Further selfish behaviour and brinkmanship by those with more clout than I won't get us out of this miserable position any faster. With a treatment or vaccine there will need to be plain speaking and thoughful responses all around, even though those are in very short supply from a number of people who should know better but don't give a damn about anyone except themselves."
"It's a global issue and there should be a global solution, but that is far easier said than done.Personally, I think that in the UK the front line workers in the medical or caring professions should have priority and then people like transport workers, refuse collectors and other lower paid workers who are the ones that actually keep everything going.DC, the PM and the rest of the cabinet should be last in the queue.Edited: 9:19 am, May 27, 2020 "
RojBlake - I hope there is a sensible plan (Ha! what am I saying?) that prioritises who get the vaccine.They haven't managed very well with the testing so the outlook doesn't look promising.
I don't think they've manged much well. I take no pleasure in saying that as I'm conscious of how many lives have been lost. I also didn't expect any government to get everything spot on. But the mistakes from the UK government have been too numerous not to attract criticism.
Definitely front line care workers first then vulnerable either older or with health issues next.
">>> Definitely front line care workers first then vulnerable either older or with health issues next. <<<So essentially, everyone that already qualifies for a free 'flu jab. That will make it easy to target recipients, but what will need to be developed quickly is a strategy to make sure that people who qualify get their vaccination promptly and safely."
"""So essentially, everyone that already qualifies for a free 'flu jab.""Yes in theory quite easy for them. Now let's see how the Government can 5crew it up."
"I can see some Countries insisting on a Covid vaccine and certificate before they let tourists in, like needing say Yellow Fever in order to travel from Gambia to U.S;There will then be a secondary private market for the jab from travel clinics, at maybe £40-60 a time?"
"^^ Re post 63, if that were the case then the number of leisure travellers would be microscopic over the next year or two. Cities and countries whose economies rely on tourism and associated business would be in dire straits if no one could travel without an immunisation certificate.At the same time, without reliable antibody testing the concept of an immunity passport isn't going to work in the short term. No one thus far who has had Covid-19 illness has been recovered from it for more than six months and as such the T cell or immunoglobulin-mediated immunity after having been ill is still not known. Identifying an IgG or T cell response in the short term is one thing, but whether that will last in the long term - no one knows.There have been reports of people 'getting it a second time' matched by reports that those people have shed virus particles or never cleared the virus in the first place. Again, the time frame has been too short to determine what's really gone on.If physical distancing when possible and good hand hygiene remain in place in the short term and with loosening of restrictions then provided there isn't a large spike in cases then it may be that leisure travel can resume later this year - but that's yet to be determined. There will need to be a time when cautious optimism along with the basics (physical distancing and handwashing) will have to be trialled if we're to move on from the last three months."

">>> I can see some Countries insisting on a Covid vaccine and certificate before they let tourists in, like needing say Yellow Fever in order to travel from Gambia to U.S;There will then be a secondary private market for the jab from travel clinics, at maybe £40-60 a time? <<<=======There is of course the possibility there may never be an effective vaccine. The common cold is a type of corona virus and and despite decades of research there is no preventative treatement for it."
">>> There have been reports of people 'getting it a second time' matched by reports that those people have shed virus particles or never cleared the virus in the first place. Again, the time frame has been too short to determine what's really gone on. <<<========That is because the widley used PCR test utilised detects virus both dead or alive - it just gives a positive for the virus if does not identify if is active or not.In South Korea they have undertaken fully cultured tests after people have seemingly tested positive twice by undertaking these cultured tests they have found that the PCR tests were identifying remnant dead virus and they were not capable of reproducing.The South Korean study was extremely positive in the respect that infection prevents reinfection."
"I said it two months ago and I will say it again. Long haul international travel will not restart in any meaningful form until 2021 at the very earliest and then only in small numbers with people who have the time and money to quarantine for up to four weeks both ends...that is if there are any airlines, hotel chains and private transportation companies left operating.As for group travel (my line of work) it is dead in the water."
"Adam - you are the proverbial Kiljoy.I cannot be as pessimistic as you, life would not be worth living.I fully believe that during August, unless we encounter a severe second wave of the virus, flights will be operating internationally and it will just be a case of observing the restrictions imposed by each and every country individually. Keep well allAnthony K"
"I wish I could be as optimistic as you Anthony K . II don’t think Adam is being a killjoy at all, although I wouldn’t mind if he was wrong. I was due to travel to Canada this summer. I’ve just had an email from the accommodation that I’d booked saying that they don’t expect to be welcoming international visitors this year and offering either a full refund or a change to next year."
"It's not a question of being a killjoy, just look at the facts. No country is going to allow citizens of another country into that country without at least a certificate of immunity (what that means is open to interpretation) and they will also have to quarantine for possibly two weeks at both ends. Sorry but there it is..."
"""No country is going to allow citizens of another country into that country without at least a certificate of immunity""---Cyprus are wanting to open up to tourism again, and have openly said they will assist any visitor to the island who tests positive whilst there.https:/…world-europe-52818749"

"Well just this morning EasyJet are shedding 30% of their workforce (approx 4000 jobs) and selling off some of their fleet.They also state that they don’t envisage Pre-Covid operating levels to return until 2023!That tells its own story!Edited: 4:38 am, May 28, 2020 "
"I expect that nothing will ever return to pre-Covid19 levels, we do not need to make those mistakes again.There will be a new norm for all of us, and hopefully we will be more adherent to the Rules, Guidelines and Government advice, than say Dominic Cummings was.Keep well allAnthony K"
"Here's a prediction that may be true for the next ten years, or more ... The UK economy will have unending problems trying to return to pre-covid19 levels.Anthony K"
"Unfortunately, I agree with Anthony K. The future is very uncertain because there is no way to predict how bad second waves of the virus will be AND how prepared nations are if they get hit hard again. Parts of Long Island (40 minutes from Manhattan) are beginning to open up in Phase 1. My thought is that you only get one shot to open back up.......if you blow it......if things go bad.......there may not be a second chance.For the past many years we have taken one cruise each year and usually one 10 day European trip on our own........no plans to do any of those until it is really safe again. Sad that our September trip to London and Edinburgh had to be cancelled.....indefinitely........ Stay well."
