We are staying in Fort Morgan and have read that people leave their chairs/umbrellas on the beach overnight. Has anyone done this? No one takes them? It would be great not to take everything back and forth each day.
"People leave that stuff on the beach overnight all the time. I would imagine some have had it turn up missing, but it doesn't seem to be an epidemic."
We always left them out in fort morgan....never a problem
"We are also here now in Fort Morgan! Go ahead and leave your things, we have done it for years and have never had things go missing."
"Don't want to be pessimistic, but we left our chairs on the beach in Gulf Shores while we went back to the condo for lunch one day. Came back and they were GONE. Hopefully this was just an isolated incident, but it made me leary of leaving anything out again."
"This is our first time vacationing on the gulf, we usually are Atlantic Ocean travelers. So if I leave my stuff on the beach, how does the tide work? Is there a big difference between high and low tide like beaches in the carolinas? I love the idea of being able to leave all our chairs and umbrellas down by the water, we are in orange beach at Emerald Key."
Maybe that's the difference in beach house and condo rentals?
Tides in our area are insignificant. And the beach is plenty wide enough to leave your things well above the high water mark.
"We've stayed in condos in Orange Beach and Perdido Key and left our chairs, umbrellas, and canopy out overnight the entire week with no problems. We do always let the canopy down in the evenings, though, b/c of wind. We've also stayed out on Ft. Morgan and left our things out there as well--no problems at all."
"you're fine in Gort Morgan. In GS and Orange Beach, I'd bring them in"
"In Gulf shores I seen people leave their stuff out , and during a rainy day, I watched a guy walk on one end , grabbed a few things then walk away with free stuff. it looks like an isolated event but I wouldn't leave it all out."
"Out on Fort Morgan, you will probably be fine. For folks staying in Gulf Shores, please be sure to check out the new city rules about canopies and tents on the beach. They aren't allowed. Unfortunately, all the careless folks that abandoned them and left them as trash at the end of their stay resulted in these new rules.The tides aren't as ""big"" as on the Atlantic, but storms can cause waves to wash up further than you might expect, so just be sure to be back from the high tide line."
"We have always left our stuff on the beach in the OB/GS area. Sometimes we've had chairs vanish.....we learned to look around the beach...sometimes people will go out to the beach at night and grab some chairs to sit in then leave them sitting there. If you can't find your chairs, look around. They might be down the beach somewhere. Ha!"
We always leave our chairs on the beach when in Orange Beach. Have never had a problem. We also lower our canopy because of the wind.
When you say canopies do you mean something like a 10x10 easy up tent?
"Yes. We typically leave ours up all week and stack our beach chairs under it when we go up for the day. Have never had anyone take anything, but I guess there are no guarantees."
We are considering staying at a beach house on W. Bernard Court in Fort Morgan. Is this area a nice area to stay?Thanks
"Are they policing the new rules in GS and OB now? We usually leave our stuff out too. We have a 10x 10 canopy that we also lower at night with the chairs and boogie boards under it. Of course, we put it up behind the chair rentals, and usually make friends with the rental attendants. If we can't do that next week when we go, we might leave the big canopy at home. We are staying at Emerald Key in OB."
"Yes, Easy up tents like that. However, after just coming back from the beach yesterday, it certainly appears that enforcement of this new rule is spotty at best. Lots of tents and canopies out at the bird sanctuary on Fort Morgan, as well as the other beaches closer to town. My guess is the only place you'd really have any trouble is at the main beach in Gulf Shores at the T."
This is turtle nesting season and Fort Morgan is a prime spot. Piles of stuff on the beach overnight can make it difficult for Mama turtle when she crawls up to lay her eggs. Please show the turtles some love. Don' leave your things on the beach.
"We go to Gulf shores 3-4 times per year for many years and have always left our chairs/umbrellas for lunch, I have never heard of anyone's being taken during lunch!! But we do take them back up at the end of the day. And last time we were there it seemed like they were enforcing the no tents rule as there were NONE each morning."
Thanks BamaBeachBird for reminding us that our convenience and legal considerations shouldn't be the only things to consider in these decisions. We share the beach with lots of other critters! Now if I can just get the smokers to realize that the gulf isn't the proper place to put out and dispose of their butts.
"""Now if I can just get the smokers to realize that the gulf isn't the proper place to put out and dispose of their butts.""Good luck on that one..."
