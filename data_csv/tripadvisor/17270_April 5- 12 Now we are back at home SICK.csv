"Anybody come back and get sick afterwards. My family and I have been in rough shape since we have come back. We were very careful with what we ate and drank and our resort used bottled water. We stayed at the Wyndham. I am wondering if it was from the pool, it did not seem very clorinated. ANybody else out there??"
Perhaps next trip you should talk to your doc about DUKORAL-it is a preventative oral vaccine specifically for 'travellers stomach'. Works!
"Thanks will keep that in mind. We have been to Mexico many times, I love the country. We have never come home sick..this sick especially. Wondered if others have had similar experience."
"I feel sick every time I have to leave the island. The sickness lingers on and on, only getting somewhat better upon booking my next trip to Cozumel. The sure-fire cure for it is boarding the plane heading to Coz. All symptoms miraculously disappear! Perhaps what you are experiencing is Cozumelitis...many of us here on TA are afflicted with the sickness. Try booking another trip to the island and see if your symptoms improve...:)"
Chiq....Are you having flu like symptoms?
"My daughter was in the hospital last Friday as she was violently ill with Vomiting and D. I myself do have flu like symptoms but also the D. I am hoping its the same thing she has, different version. My son only had vomiting but now he has a cough. We are all just keeping an eye on things. We are not new to travelling to Mexico and never have been like this so thought I would post and see if others have had any similar issues."
"Too funny Wineott.No, in many trips to Mexico I've never gotten sick. When I'm on Cozumel I brush my teeth with tap water and buy food from street vendors and out of the way restaurants, and still have never gotten sick. I'm guessing that the local folks don't use the tap water either because I've seen so many bottled water delivery trucks making stops in neighborhoods. Might be that you caught your bug on the plane, they're kind of known for that."
"chiquita - I'm not making fun of you, or your family...and I'm sorry you are all so sick. I've been to Coz 3 times, no illness - son had a tummy ache one day while we were there once but that's it.What about mosquitos? Did you all get bit? What's that terrible illness Robert had? Was that Dengue Fever or something?"
"replying to myself...this bit about Dengue Fever from Wikipedia""There may also be gastritis with some combination of associated abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Some cases develop much milder symptoms which can be misdiagnosed as influenza or other viral infection when no rash is present."""
"Wineott I actually thought that was funny no offence taken. LOL Yeah, Cozumel seemed a pretty safe haven to me this is why puzzled and wanted to post and get an idea from others.Cozumel is my favorite spot so far in Mexico!! The media isn't helping my concern but I highly doubt we have what they are reporting."
There are lots of reports about this Avian flu like infection coming out of Mexico. Called an epidemic and not a pandemic yet! Not anything to be taken lightly.
It sounds more like Dengue fever ...looks like I will look into this more.
It does sound alot like that Dengue flu..going to look into it more
"Dengue usually causes extreme pain, not just gastrointestinal problems. Something you should bring up to your physician, however, is typhoid. My mother-in-law (who is from Cozumel) had typhoid a little over a year ago. We visited during that time and did not know she had it, and my son came down with a horrible gastrointestinal illness that lasted for 2 weeks when we got home. We assumed it was a viral thing until we went into the second week of it. Once we figured it out, and he started antibiotics, he was fine. Typhoid is alive and ""well"" in Cozumel... "
"That sounds awful! I feel like we are now on the tv show ""House"". My guess is Dysentary or Salmonella. I believe Dengue Fever is a blood transmitted disease from Mosquitoes. Since all family members are ill, I am guessing this is from oral consumption. I am assuming the test reslults are not back yet. The cough may be an unrelated secondary isssue. Please, let us know that the doctors conclude form this. I am sending some mojo your way for a fast recovery. "
"I forgot to ask if your family has seen an Infectious Disease doctor. I think they are the best(unfortunately under utiliized) resource for not only diagnosing, but tracking down the sources of these illnesses. "
"Was there april 8-16th and ate nearly everything that moved , from 1.00$ fish tacos at street vendors to Sorressi back to bread pudding off some dudes porch. Not any problems ...... yet MD"
Yeah looking into Dengue no its not that.Her blood tests came back with a gastrointestinal virus. She was down a week ago for almost a week but on the mend. I have been down for last 2-3 days and my son only 1 day. My husband (touch wood) nothing at all. We are waiting for stool results. Will keep everyone posted. I don't suspect its something we ate but at this point who knows!
I spent a year traveling often for work - it seemed every time I traveled I came back sick from something. I think airplanes are just chock full of germs and it could be anything from anywhere !
Thanks to everyone for the replies they are helpful
"Hope you are starting to feel a little better. I would think the best chance for picking up a bug was on the airplane. Air is recirculated and anybody who has the flu or something contagious is going to pass it to you. If your entire family is ill, that is the likely cause and you are probably passing it back and forth to each other. A girl in our office came back from Florida recently and within two days had pneumonia like symptoms. When I travelled a lot for business, I always picked up something from the airline. I have learned the value of extreme hand washing and sanitizing wipes for everything I touch, including the airline trays and arm rests. Hope you feel better soon."
Thank you! That could very well be the case also! 
Chiquitagirl - we were there from April 11-18 and no problems. Sorry to hear of your misfortune. Hopefully it won't deter you from future trips.
"just dont second-guess yourself or the well-meaning peeps on TA. if you are sick when you get home, get thyself to a doctor -- post-haste....preferably an infectious disease specialist.Once returning from Antigua...I ended up with Dysentery. Took me years to get it out of my system...every year when the weather got hot....there it was.........The best you can do is watch what you eat/drink, WASH YOUR HANDS frequently....I firmly believe if its gonna happen, then its gonna happen.My tummy isnt what it used to be......lately every time I go to Mexico............""whoops, there it is"" (not D.)"
"I was on Coz from the 11th-18th. On the night of the 15th, I had dinner at one of my favorite places, and a couple hours later, became very sick. Sparing the details, I have not talked to Ralph on the big white telephone for longer than I can remember, but we had a lengthy conversation. The next day, my local friends gave me a coke and as much fresh squeezed Lime juice as I could handle. Voila! Though I was somewhat lacking in energy, my system was fine, and I was able to enjoy the remainder of my week with no problem. This is not to say that it is a cure-all, nor a substitute for seeing a physician if symptoms are acute. It is simply a tip for those who might encounter something that upsets the digestive system. The locals swear by it, and now I do as well.Sorry you had to go through this. The Wyndham was formerly the ""Reef Club"" and through some reports similar to yours a year or so ago became known around our house as the ""Ralph Club"".Greg"
"I personally think airports & airplanes pass more germs around than just about any other place I know of. People from every corner of the earth are passing by and can easily be spreading germs picked up half way around the world. Unfortunately you still could have picked up something at the resort, either while swimming or eating, and like a few others have suggested when it's all of you it's more likely a bug than food poisening unless you all were eating the very same food or drinking the same drinks etc. It's still a possibility, but less likely than a flu bug deciding that your group needed a new friend. "
"Chiquitagirl, I notice that you are from Toronto. If you have any problems getting a good clear diagnosis, there is a terrific clinic at Missionary Health Institute. It is located at Shepherd and Leslie (across from North York Hospital) (4000 Leslie Street) They specialize in tropical disorders...and treat lots of people who work overseas. We have received great care there. I think OHIP covered our treatment there. Just in case your problems aren't easily solved, these people deal with international health cases every day. "
"I don't want to start any rumors... but on the news in Austin Texas last night (Friday April 24) all the news stations had reports of Swine Flue in Mexico... It is a version that can be passed from one person to another (and not just animal to human). There have been some cases in the US reported from people that traveled to Mexico ( a couple in Calif. and a couple in Texas).It has already killed about 1000 people in Mexico City. And Mexico City has shut down government offices and many schools, until they can get a handle on it.The cases found in the US are all doing OK following the illness. Just something to be aware of. Wash hands alot while down there."
CDC (Atlanta) info on Swine Fluhttp://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/
"mexico city.....cozumel , very very far apart. don't know where you got your info but 1000 people have not died. most stomach problems come from food. eating things that our bodies are not used to ie; lots of fresh fruit ( coconut),spicey foods. airplanes are a flying petre dish in my opinion. hope you get well soon. thanks for being smart and not slamming cozumel for your illness, happy to hear that you will return. would love to hear a review when your feeling better."
"Dysentery???? Typhiod Fever???? ...Sounds like an American Civil War forum. Did you come in contact with any Confederate Soldiers or eat ""hardtack"" while down there?I've never accepted the idea of airplanes being Petri dishes. Good luck!"
"""""""I don't want to start any rumors........It has already killed about 1000 people in Mexico City.""""""""""----------Hey Austin-cruiser........you need to go watch your news channels again......that would be about 1000 people SICK, not dead!......they do say 60 people have died possibly from this nightmare and that's tragic enough.Betsy"
Correction from what I stated in an earlier post... News is stating that about 1000 sick from Swine Flue (not 1000 dead) in Mexico City and about 60 have died.This mornings news also indicated that some high school students from New York are being tested because they are getting sick and they also recently returned from Mexico (I'm not sure where). 
Chiquita-I hope you are all feeling better! 
I was just thinking of Chiquita and family too...hope you'll update us.
"gosh, i really hope you do not have the swine flu? Make sure you attend a doctors immediatley."
"Thanks to all for the messages. Well a few days days for me and I am well now. My daughter took a week but also well now and trying to put the weight back on. (not me - trying to keep it off).No swine flu and no parasite.It was a bit of a scare because my daughter was so violently ill and it really brought us down. The swine flu reports with little information last week did not help matters. I do not think to this day it was anything we ate, I still suspect the pool water she swallowed.Not sure what went through our family for 2 weeks but its 2 weeks today we returned and now that we are well I have been thinking about how beautiful Cozumel was.Thanks again to everyone! :-)"
Chiquitagirl: did you change planes in Mexico City??
"According to a live phone call from our Governor Felix Gonzalez Canto at the local News station (Sol Stereo), up to now Monday April the 27th there has not been presence of the flu in the state of Quintana Roo.Lets hope its stays that way and we are taking all preventive procedures to keep it that way even though they might look to extreme its better to preventStay in touch and we will keep reportingAdrian Angulo"
Chiquita - so glad to hear that you are all well now! Thanks for letting us know.
No we did not change planes in MX City. Thank goodness but we did stop in Cancun.
"Good to hear, then it is very unlikely that what your family is experiencing is the swine flu in the news.How is your family doing??"
Good to hear that you are all much better. Also that it was no the swine flu.
"Don't let the media get ahold of this, it would be ""SWINE FLU DISCOVERED IN WYNDAM COZUMEL"""
Glad to hear you all are on the mend ! 
JTHOSKE...LOL... soo true. Hey whatever sells papers and gets people to tune in right.
