"Our family is taking Spring break vacation in Las Vegas. We are driving from Oregon and wondering if it's still going to be worth going, or if everything's going to be shut down when we get there. Thoughts?"
"Don’t go. Just started, most places will be closed."
"The closures are ongoing, really almost non-stop. Certainly possible, most think probable that there will be a total Strip shutdown coming after the weekend. Not to mention there is a rapidly growing number of infected, including casino employees themselves.So I wouldn't, nor would I recommend it at all. But monitor here and elsewhere as it may not be an option soon anyways."
">>>The closures are ongoing, really almost non-stop. Certainly possible, most think probable that there will be a total Strip shutdown coming after the weekend.<<<Source on total Strip shutdown????"
"I doubt much will be going at that point. A couple of weeks later... There may be a small chance, but not that soon."
"No.I had to cancel mine today. I am so dissapointed and angry at everything and everyone. All shows, buffets, spas, clubs and events in vegas are cancelled and with employees of key resorts getting sick it could mean even more problems in next few weeks.What sucks even more is that once the epidemic will be over (july ?) The Vegas prices will sky rocket to historic all time high and I'm just not willing to pay that"
"Don't get so puked out, Carrie. There are so many better destinations than ol' Vegas."
"Definitely don't go. What's the point of going to Vegas if the restaurants, bars, shows and casinos are closed? Unless you want to visit some of the great parks in Nevada."
"Fair point. My apologies Nitro. I misspoke, and I've tried to be careful with my language. Let me rephrase. How about ""people who have followed the progression of COVID-19 closely and understand how it is affecting our society everywhere find it all but inevitable that casinos will be forced to close down."""
">>>>How about ""people who have followed the progression of COVID-19 closely and understand how it is affecting our society everywhere find it all but inevitable that casinos will be forced to close down.""<<<<Source on this comment? I would publish it, if I had a source or two, or three. I was on the Las Vegas Strip today and it was dead, except at the Flamingo, Linq and Bally's casinos. Everywhere else was very slow. I have read nothing about the Vegas Strip casinos closing down. Yes, it could happen.Over 90% of the restaurants remain open in Las Vegas. Many shows remain open, some with reduced hours, some canceled or rescheduled. I will be in Downtown Las Vegas tomorrow to see how that is going."
I agree with Nitro. Las Vegas is slowing down and it could finally take a break. His assessment on the current status is spot on. Every day something new is either limited or closed. I suspect more to come until things around the US get better.

"I know that NitroDog is a Las Vegas booster but things are going down hill fast. Below is just a start. going to get worse before it gets better. See below.MGM Resorts announces layoffs, closures, 'several' employees with coronavirushttps://www.fox5vegas.com/coronavirus/mgm-re…"
We have plans to go the same days. So far they’ve canceled one of our dinner reservations and rescheduled one of our shows. I have till Thursday to cancel the hotel. It’s not looking promising.
"The only thing I have found that has already closed is the Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat as far as attractions go.We are going with the kids, so Casinos aren't a top priority for us.I will hold off until Friday to make a final decision."
"I mean, all MGM properties are closed, Wynn is closed, all Cirque shows are closed, buffets all closed, several additional restaurants closed, pools closed. More to come this week. Government strongly suggesting limiting crowds. Does it seem worth it to vacation now?"
"We are to go the same dates and to be staying at the Flamingo. I’m ok with bars shutting down as we don’t drink a lot of alcohol and do with out. It’s not about the gambling etc. just a vacation and do some sight seeing. Possible a off road tour with dune buggy’s or ATVs. We were checking into shows and had tickets for the at the Excalibur but we have already received our money back on them tickets. I’m guessing it’s going to be a more of what you make of it. Plus side it it’s not busy = less chance to catch the virus, in my opinion. I mean I can catch it just going to local supermarket here so what’s the difference."
">> I mean I can catch it just going to local supermarket here so what’s the difference.The difference is that going to the local supermarket to purchase food is an ""essential"" activity, traveling to Las Vegas for vacation is not.We're all being asked to exercise social distancing as much as possible, not just for yourself but for everyone."
"""We are to go the same dates and to be staying at the Flamingo.""Want to bet?"
I hope y’all that are going next week don’t carry the virus with you back home and then infect older family members or friends. This ain’t the flu.
Do your fellow human beings a favor and stay home.
"So everyone , including the government is saying stay at home, ,yet people still think it is ok to travel to tourist areas...How about camping with a tent in the woods,,probably safer"

"Well, since casinos do not matter and no fear of infecting others, why would you go to Vegas at all...but then they did close more casinos but the infection still goes on"
"It's official, all casinos are closed in Nevada for 30 days so this answers your question."
"Not just casinos, either. All hotels and motels."
">>Not just casinos, either. All hotels and motels.<<Are you sure? I havent heard this and on the Marriott website it shows availability at their properties across the Valley. The exception being Cosmo."
"He, GoodBeer, they're yanking your chain.OP, just wait til the all clear is given."
"All casinos, schools, bars and most restaurants are closed here. Take out and delivery still available at some but no table seating. Liquor stores are closing tonight, and heard beer and wine will be closed on Thursday. Retail stores are announcing closures daily. We had 83 new cases since yesterday the numbers are frightening but meaningless almost since they have changed by the time they get put to paper.Canadians have been told to return while they still can. Absolutely baffles me that people are even considering non essential travel at this time.Edited: 11:15 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"Hey, Goodbeer. They are no longer yanking.Op, it is done.Edited: 11:17 pm, March 17, 2020 "
">>Hey, Goodbeer. They are no longer yanking.Op, it is done.<<Not sure what you are referring to? I’m aware of what’s closed except hadn’t heard all hotels in LV, Marriott properties are showing availability."
"""Gov. Steve Sisolak imposed a mandatory closure of non-essential businesses including casinos, resorts, restaurants, and bars starting at noon on March 18 in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. Casinos, hotels, and motels must remain closed for a minimum of 30 days.""https://vegas.eater.com/2020/3/17/21184421/n…https:/…1240077329281380353"
"Visiting Vegas is all about the crowds, the noise, and the overall excitement. Wait until it returns to some semblance of normalcy, then go."
"If you are following the news,all Las Vegas casinos are closed for 30 days minimum."
Seriously? We must have all missed that!?!?
Right13
"reschedule, nothing to go for in Vegas or as a matter of fact, don't go anywhere. I am going to book in May and hope for the best"
I would just stay home since most places in Vegas will probably close anyway
