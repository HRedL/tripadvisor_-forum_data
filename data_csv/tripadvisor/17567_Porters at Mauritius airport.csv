"Are porters readily available in the baggage hall at Mauritius airport? If so, how much do they charge? Also is it too far to walk from baggage hall to the exit? We have booked hotel transfer from airport to hotel. Thanks"
Yes porters are around the luggage carousels.But no problem with luggage trollies as they are free.And not far from baggage hall to exit.
"Thanks so much for this info. I'm travelling with an older person and so wanted to be sure we could handle the luggage. Also, please reply to one other query..should we be worried about the Flu epidemic?"
The furthest distance you will have to walk is from the airbridge to immigration and then to the luggage hall which involves escalators.If you are at all worried that the older person will cope you can request assistance from your airline before you fly. Emirates are very good with this if you are flying Emirates.I don't think you need to be concerned re the flu outbreak - this happens every year in winter in Mauritius just as it does in the UK.Latest info:www.microsofttranslator.com/BV.aspxâ€¦
Thanks for that prompt response. Appreciate it.
Yes I have requested wheelchair assistance for the elderly passenger travelling with me. Can you please tell me if the wheelchair is made available on disembarking the aircraft. Thanks
"Yes it is , at the aircraft door. There are also chairs that will fit down the aircraft aisle if the elderly person is unable to walk. Make sure you let the airline know early of your requirements."
We needed a wheelchair for our return leg last year and had excellent service at the airport. Porter was waiting for us when we arrived and stayed with us until my mom was safely on the plane.
"Yes, they meet the aircraft at the airbridge, no problems."
Thank you so much for your response.
Thanks Brendan for the help regarding the wheelchair. I really appreciate it
