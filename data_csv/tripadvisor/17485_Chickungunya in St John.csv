Heading to St John next week. First time back in 20yrs! Looking forward to it but what's the status of Chickungunya on the island? Saw a report that there are cases in St Thomas. Are mosquitoes particularly bad at some beaches in St John vs. others?
"You got the spelling wrong but there have been a couple of recent threads on the subject and here's a link to one of them:tripadvisor.com/â€¦58959044There has been one USVI case reported which was contracted locally, two cases contracted outside the USVI and two blood samples currently being tested.The proliferation of mosquitoes is entirely dependent on the weather. It's been very dry lately so the population is down but as soon as we get some decent rain the eggs hatch and off we go again. Use Deet-containing repellent as religiously as you do sunscreen lotion and all will be well!"
We have been on St. John since Monday night and I have seen a total of 1 mosquito but he was about 1 inch long!.
""". . . a total of 1 mosquito but he was about 1 inch long!.""OK then, if all of them are at least that size you will be able to visually guard against any trouble because only the females bite."
We got about 4 bites among our group yesterday so they are around. We're going to be more disciplined about using the Off today.
How's it going down there folks...still relatively mosquitoes free? Any more cases? Can you buy DEET etc on the Island. Traveling light.
"Nothing's changed. Yes, you can purchase Deet-containing repellents here with no problem."
"My wife and I are in St. John now - we arrived on 7/2 and we each get bit about 6 times a day. I NEVER get bit by mosquitoes either so it is a bit surprising how often I have been bit so far.We use ""special"" mosquito soap, OFF Woods DEET spray, and carry an OFF insect repellant and somehow we still get bit often. There is a lotion called ""Quit It"" made on the island - it has helped me a TON. I put it on and the bites no longer bother me. It isn't as effective on my wife but she has very fair and sensitive skin.If it helps, we have been mostly in the Coral Bay area.Edited: 6 years ago "
"""I NEVER get bit by mosquitoes either so it is a bit surprising how often I have been bit so far.""Michael, it's a common mistake to think that because the mossies at home don't bother you, the same will be true here. Not so. Different areas breed different strains and the last time I got caught out really badly was many years ago when I first went on a weekend trip to Vieques and (stupidly) assumed that since the mosquitoes here didn't bother me much any more, I wouldn't have a problem on an island so relatively close. I was attacked with no mercy within a few short hours and the welts on my legs far outlasted the getaway! Didn't make that mistake again!"
We are in Coral Bay pretty high up on the mountain with a good breeze and we've only had a problem one day. I've seen a couple but no new bites. We brought one bottle of non-aerosol Off and it is easily going to do us 10 days but we're only using it before we go out in the morning and we haven't been out very much at all in the evening. We had several rain showers pass through today and it looks like tomorrow will be the same so that might bring some out.
So here's a crazy question...how do you use the 100% DEET? I bought some at Tractor Supply and I know it eats through synthetic fabrics. Do you actually put that on your skin??? I would think it would eat your skin too!Anyone used the full strength version?
I wouldn't. Regular off is a strong as I'll go. It's more improtant to be dillegent about maintaing your surrondings.
I think it is important to remember to protect yourself from bites no matter where you are. We have four confirmed cases in Massachusetts as of July 4th weekend. This is not just an island epidemic.
"Deep Woods Off is my go to, no matter where I am. CT, Maine, STJ, anywhere"
"Magee4475: Just to clarify, the reported cases in MA and those in other states were contracted by visitors returning from affected areas, not contracted locally."
"Understood, but in the same right, they can affect others if bitten. Just better to be safe than to be sorry."
"Be cautious with the 100% DEET. I applied heavily (at home) and broke out badly. Yes, it will dissolve plastic and rubber, so spray lightly on clothing."
"""Understood, but in the same right, they can affect others if bitten. ""Maybe I'm misinformed but my understanding is that the mosquito genus which carries the virus isn't found outside certain tropical areas which is why there is no concern of a general health alert in MA or anywhere else outside those regions."
