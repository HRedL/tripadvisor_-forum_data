"Hello,What is you perception on your holidays due within the next few weeks in terms of the spreading coronavirus? Are you cancelling or are you going? I have Crete booked in April and not sure what to do?Thanks"
"from my perspective, nothing would stop me visiting crete at all, except cancelled flights. if the plane flies, im on it."
"It's a very fluid situation that seems to get worse every day but like Davo, I would be very loathe to cancel unless either the government here issues travel restrictions or the airline cancels. We are hearing about the travellers that are catching coronavirus but there are millions & millions of travellers who travel daily & are not having problems. Nobody can say what the position will be by April"

"You might wish to consider the travel insurance position as I read it. If the govt decrees that you should not travel to a specific country, you are covered. If you ""just don't fancy it"" because of the media coverage, then you are not. Might just help with your decision. My personal view is as #s 1 and 2, but its obviously a personal decision. Each to their own."
"It can't be stressed enough that this is a personal decision, and that means that decisions about travel should be based less on one's views than on one's age and one's health - and certainly not on the opinions of others on a travel forum. It has been made quite clear that older people, and people with respiratory illnesses or diabetes, are at risk of serious illness or death if they contract the virus. Of course people shouldn't panic, or believe everything they read in the panic-stirring tabloids, but many may wish to take sensible precautions For some people, not travelling may fall into that category. Reassurance, therefore, may be out of order.Here is a link to a discussion of the myths that have been circulating about Covid-19, including the one about it being no worse than flu.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/0…Edited: 10:43 am, March 01, 2020 "
"Don’t ""flu"" affect the flight. If it wasn't so much pomp and mystification, no one would have paid more attention than the usual occasional epidemic."
"Luckily for you, Ntragkon, Antarctica hasn't been affected yet by the virus."
"Unless the Foreign Office says no, I'll be on the flight."
"Coronavirus is the first true ""infodemia"" in the world. We need a vaccine against misinformation. Covide-19, compared with a ""Migrant"" crisis is “hay fever”.I've been reading all day about events on the Turkish-Greek border and then, here, I see a man planning to spend two weeks in Lesbos. I wonder is it maybe some Antarctic penguin breeder, one of my uninformed neighbors? :)@Alabastron Believe me my neighborhood is incomparably better at least than yours. lolEdited: 3:22 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"I'm not going to Crete (going to Lesvos, Naxos, and mainland in mid-May), but personally I'm not concerned. Where I live, there are about the same number of cases as in Greece. Right now, Greece seems like they have it under control and one of the countries that are the safest in terms of COVID-19 (like poster above me said, migrant crisis is much more of an imminent worry).Every time there's a novel disease that we don't know much about, people panic. So far, mortality rate is reported as 2%, but most experts think it's much less (there are many people out there that truly have it, that we never diagnosed because they were asymptomatic). The best advice is, if you have a predisposed condition, are older (>65 years old), or live in the same household as someone who potentially could get seriously ill from the virus, you may want to re-consider traveling, period. The chance of you contracting it in Greece is probably much less likely than getting struck by lightning, but traveling means being at an airport / on a train / bus to get to Greece. It is these places where I'm most afraid of contracting the virus (again, not for myself, but potentially for older, more at-risk people I may come in contact with).Edited: 3:42 pm, March 01, 2020 "
">>If we take in to acound those who have not symptoms maybe the percent is lower than 0.01.<<I suspect this is probably true. Still when people panic, reason and logic is of little significance. Panic has already sent the entire world into chaos and caused so much economic impact."
"Aman, leave that corona nonsense!. Watch as Lesbos transforms before our eyes in one huge repository, depot of future problems."
I have with much regret just cancelled my 3 week trip to the islands and Athens and nearby Europe. The situation is very fluid and with fast changes. Besides i have airline transfer points that may be affected. What is worrying most is the sudden lockdown of towns and suspension of flights. Not to mention of isolation for 14 days a possibility. This is my view and may difer with the other travellers.
In case anyone is genuinely interested:https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/0…Of what possible relevance can it be to compare the Covid-19 situation with the current refugee crisis in Lesvos?
"Presumably because large number of people living in close proximity, with poor sanitation, is an ideal breeding ground for many diseases. If there is a mass movement of refugees it certainly won't help the situation."
#15 Go ask those in Lesbos.
Taking your precautions helps. Cancelling your trip is a bit over the edge. If you are carefull and wash your hands regularly you should be fine. Its just all the media terorizing people about covid 19
"Any type of virus will be easier to get on the way to work or in the theater, supermarkets… than in the sun and fresh air. I know, I can hear you already - what about the plane, the airports, the crowds... Yes, but there they control everyone for the virus, in shopping malls - not. Have you stopped leaving the house?"
">Have you stopped leaving the house?<Lots of people, have, Ntragkon especially those in the groups most at risk (though perhaps not in Antarctica).A friend who has prostate cancer and has recently had a hip replacement is seriously considering self-isolation (those with compromised immune systems are among those at risk or falling seriously ill, or dying, along with old people and those with underlying health conditions including respiratory issues and diabetes).Another friend, a consultant and professor at one of London's foremost teaching hospitals, has advised his wife and friends to lay in good supplies of foo, which are disappearing from supermarket shelves. This may be a realistic response to the tabloid-spurred panic and it might not be necessary if the panic wasn't on, but it is on. That, of course, has become a part of the problem - but it doesn't mean there is no problem."
"unfortunately I can't see any country avoiding it including India. So unless you stay in you will be at risk. Washing your hands is difficult, just walking around a supermarket, I handle the trolley, pick up plastic covered items that previous customers have looked at, all this whilst not rubbing an itch on ones nose or eyes. Washing my hands at home, I then have handled my car keys and steering wheel for next time.Edited: 8:05 am, March 06, 2020 "

"Ntragkon, you and your doctor wife are obviously well informed, so I imagine you share my concern, although you may not be in one of the high-risk groups, as I am (an over-80 asthmatic). In fact, I'm not especially concerned for myself, though I'm not sorry not to have travel plans at the moment. What does concern me is the hollow reassurances posted almost daily on this and other forums by people who have been persuaded that the virus is a storm in a teacup trumped up to sell more newspapers.A day or two ago, on another forum, I used the word ""insouciant"" to describe such reassurances. Actually, I think ""irresponsible"" is more accurate. When one knows nothing of the age or health history of the person asking the question, it is irresponsible to tell someone that it's safe to travel, or that there is no risk in such-and-such a city or country. The risk is now everywhere, and multiplying fairly rapidly; and decisions about the safety of travel should be based on one's knowledge of oneself, and on the advice given by the public health authorities.Whether or not this virus will become a pandemic is not yet known and won't be for a while. If it is brought under control, or unexpectedly fizzles out, we'll all be relieved. Meanwhile it makes sense to be vigilant and to observe sensible precautions, especially if one is in one of those at high risk of becoming severely ill, or dying.Edited: 12:17 pm, March 06, 2020 "

Wise words Yiassas. The sooner this peaks (and falls) the better.
"@Alabastron, dear sir, I fully understand your concern and I entirely agree with you.At the same time, I’m trying to stay calm and rational, warning people not to exaggerate. But only to the limits of responsible assertion. If it were otherwise, you would have every right to use ""insouciant"" or „unconscious“ or whichever locution you choose, in your own discretion. And, you have to believe me, I will accept it unconditionally.In the circumstances described, there are few ladies and gentlemen who will take the risk and decide to travel at such an awkward moment. Responsibility to oneself and to others is more pronounced in older generations. We assume that the younger population and the lower risk groups will go on vacation. What I want to emphasize is that we should not succumb to panic, hoping there would be no place for that.Sincerely,DragonEdited: 2:48 pm, March 06, 2020 "

"Don't worry, Dragon: it isn't important. If it was I'd have told you myself.What is important is the matter of the virus, on which I suspect we agree.It's those ""limits of responsible assertion"" that have been ignored by some posters recently, but that seems to be changing now as the situation worsens. Dimitris has it right in post 23."
"We agree on this as well.Dimitris seems like a reasonable man. Btw, post 23 is mine. You are probably thinking of post 26.Though, it doesn't matter. It is important to understand each other in crucial matters."
"Am also watching this space closely as I am intending to go on a trip to Greece in the last two weeks of April (albeit Athens, Santorini, Mykonos, Meteora/Delphi).This may be tangentially linked to Covid - but was wondering if racism should be an issue that people should be concerned about? You might have read about various reports of Asians being targeted (and the most recent was a Singapore law student being attacked in London)."
Right: I meant post 26.
"DimitrisMost medical authorities including WHO say 3.4% is the death rate for coronavirus versus .1% for the flu. I’m wondering where you’re getting your vastly lower number? I mean, what valid medical source?Edited: 10:10 pm, March 07, 2020 "
We too have a trip planned for first two weeks in May to Crete. Have not cancelled and I keep telling myself all will be fine but each new day it seems to change. I guess we'll have to wait and see what the next few weeks bring. Currently I have a flight but holding off on other reservations until we know more.....
"We also have a trip booked for Athens, Crete & peloponnese at the beginning of May we’re unsure at the moment like many travellers we will monitor the situation & make a decision that best suits us.There’s a lot of info out there so best to stick to reputable sources and it’s also good to read other travellers thoughtsEdited: 9:31 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"My wife and I are booked for 3 weeks in the Greek islands in mid april. We are both 30, fit and healthy Australian's so baring a travel ban we will be going ahead with our trip. Everything in life is a risk assessment, and this decision is no different. As far as your own health, the statistics show if you are under 60 the likelihood of you getting severely/fatally sick is so low it's not worth loosing sleep over, however if you are over 60 I would seriously consider postponing a trip if it is viable to do so.I for one will be vigilant with anti-bacterial wipes on planes, and always have hand santiser's on hand prior to eating etc, etc. If we are beginning to show feverish signs we will seek medical advise safely ASAP. short of that this will not stop me having the trip of a lifetime and I must admit I think I wilkl enjoy a nice quiet stroll down the empty streets of Oia at sunset."
Have a great time Tizza
Lots of us have plans but we have to wait and see. I can't say I would be wanting to go to Italy at this point in time.
Yes same here will just have to see how the situation pans out Gemma as nobody knows how this is going to work out.
"Have there been any confirmed cases in Crete? the latest info is vague, just lists some mainland cities plus ""other areas"" I read this morning that there is a case on Lesbos which obviously has potential to be an absolute disaster given the current situation there.We are due to fly to crete on Apr 1st"
No confirmed cases in Crete yet.
We are due to travel in May and hope as Crete is an island the will be no impact over the next few weeks.
"Hi twinkletoes,I think it was a new reporter on the TV last night that said the same thing. Although one had to sign papers to prove your journey was necessary with heavy fines if not adhered to, There was no road check carried out on him during his journey out"
"23twinkletoes late last week a plane showed up in Sydney every one on board went about their business until the next day when they realised that some on on the plane had the virus . I dont know who was trying get in touch with every one on that plane but some how they lost the manifest . The authorities put out a call for any one on that plane to come forward for testing. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT ONE. Also Ferrari were let in to Melbourne for the GP This week although the north of Italy was in lock down .Now 3 members of the GP crew have the virus. To add it was not Ferrari crew but just goes to show its not just you over there its us here too . Its like a monty python sketch . Looks like we most certainly got to cancel our trip in May no Chania for us this year Good luck over there Hope Crete stays virus free.Edited: 7:52 am, March 11, 2020 "
"We're due out for June as normal this year and even though being seniors with some ailments and so are in a higher risk category we will still be going unless told we can't/shouldn't. I feel for the businesses and their employees who have a short summer season and rely on this to see them through the winter. Try and stay safe everyone.Edited: 8:33 am, March 11, 2020 "
"The economic effects of this virus will be massive, and felt by many across the globe. I can’t help wondering where the people on the flight from Rome last night have all gone off to now....and how many will willingly self isolate.There are small mercies to be found amongst the sadness of the deaths that have already occurred. What if this virus had killed/kills everyone who gets infected? The next mutation could. This is a wake up call for sure and who knows yet how this will all end? Sorry, don’t mean to sound all doom and gloom. Look after yourselves everybody and be mindful of the vulnerable."
"Instead of listening to hear-say on TA, or to the more or less coloured press, I would advice everybody to listen only to the official health authorities. The situation in Greece and all other countries has changed dramatically since the OP, 9 cases in Greece is now 99. All Greek schools are now to stay closed for two weeks. All sports events are to be held without audience. The neighboering country Italy is closed down. Lets hope Greece is not following. Here in Norway 90% of the cases can be traced to winter sports resorts in Italy/Alps/Tirol, or the flights to and from. Do the utmost to avoid Crete, or any other part of Greece, to be the next source."

Once your season starts Dimitri Crete will be at risk once tourists start to arrive. I have watched the figures rise in Italy and it is frightening and nothing like the figures you talk about in post 3.
"WHO have now declared the Corona situation a Pendemia.Edited: 1:59 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"We won't be doing any advance bookings for anything, plenty of good deals to had later if it's ok to travel."
We're booked for Crete in September so with any luck the worst will be over by then. Virologists say that most viruses are weakened by hot weather so it has to be hoped that CV follows the normal pattern.
"Coralee, re #45, as things currently stand, we are more likely to contract coronavirus in our own countries than we are in Crete. I am also travelling to Crete in April, and am wondering if it’s more likely that Greece will ban flights from UK/European countries as the numbers of cases increase, or that the affected countries will be locked down (and quite rightly so). Twinkletoes re #48 that’s rather surprising and worrying that there were no checks or screening procedures in place at a UK airport for a flight returning from Italy. I travelled in Africa during the Ebola crisis and every airport, even the most rustic, basic ones in remote areas, had screening procedures in place. Deborah R re #54, I agree, there is no logic in quarantining those coming into the UK from Wuhan and the cruise ship in Japan, and then letting planes loads arrive from northern Italy over the weekend and disperse into the community!! Hopefully as the weather improves the numbers of coronavirus victims will decline and that the economy won’t be too badly affected in Crete."
We are due to go in 4 weeks so hope that you stay virus free and tourists don't bring it with them.
"We returned to Heathrow from Singapore just under 3 weeks ago when Singapore was one of the high risk countries, and prior to landing we were informed that everyone on board the plane would have to be cleared by the health authorities before disembarking.To be honest we were all very surprised that this did not include at least temperature taking,it was basically a quick visual once over as we walked off of the plane and handed a leaflet that warned of what symptoms to look out for and a contact number if any symptoms appeared within the next 14 days.No wonder the virus is now spreading!!,on the other hand we witnessed temperature taking in many places such as shopping malls,visitor attractions and at the airport in Singapore,the spreading of the virus has since apparently been brought under control to manageable means.As an add on one of our party did come down with several of the symptoms and contacted the said number,thankfully the test was negative but the results took 96 hours to come back.Hopefully Greece takes this far more seriously than we seem to have done here in the UK."
We are going to Crete on May 7th for a week. We are not canceling unless flights are canceled and/or the government(s) forces us not to go.
"We live in Canada and were meant to fly out yesterday via London, but the Canadian airline Westjet changed their cancellation policy and gave us full travelcredits for the cost. Since then WHO declared a pandemic with more closures, cancellations, etc, so we're relieved to be at home. Where do you live? There will be very few flights between US and Europe. Everyone has to make an individual decision and an important factor for us is to enjoy our travel, not be stuck somewhere in quarantine or lockdown."
I am worried and wish I could cancel my trip. Already paid over 6 thousand in airline tickets and resort payments. I feel totally stuck. The way things stand right now I would not get on an airplane. My husband is almost 86. He said he won't lose the money and plans on going hell or high water.
I suppose that in such a fast moving story it was inevitable: chaniapost.eu/2020/…
janineoSan Francisco..HI there for 3 grand your husband is willing to risk his life. He got no idea about how the Greek health system works does he??? Let him go say a good goodbye and let him go.You stay home . We have almost cancelled everything I know we will have to but just dont want to admit it to our self yet . Good luck what ever you decied. But I am with you on this one.
"Janine, this is too bad, and I sympathise with you and your husband: I'm sure everyone does. Your husband isn't thinking clearly, and that isn't entirely his fault. Your President has unfortunately made the corona virus situation much worse for you and all your fellow citizens by downplaying its extreme seriousness for his own electoral ends, so perhaps your husband isn't aware of how serious it is. At 86, your husband is in the highest risk category: the risk is of dying of the virus if he catches it. I am guessing that you too, even if several years younger than your husband, are also an older person and are also at risk. If he, or you, has underlying health issues - lung, heart, diabetes, all common in old age - the risk is greater. There can be few things more risky than travelling right now: the time spent in airports and on aircraft puts anyone who travels at great risk. I can certainly understand his reluctance to lose $6,000+, but this may be one of those times when you may have to take matters into your own hands, make a unilateral decision to cancel your trip, and tell him you've done so.Edited: 3:01 am, March 13, 2020 "
One of our leading holiday insurance companies has suspended all new holiday insurance. So if others follow suit there will be less insurance cover out there
I think it's such a fluid situation that anything could happen really. It's good that some businesses (I'm sure there was a post on here about Autorentals) are making contingency plans for their customers. If people are worried - they should contact their holiday provider.
"Kalimera to all of you.I agree with Alabastron, and Ginesy. Disagree with Comet, someone who have never lived in Greece knows nothing about the Greek Health System. I am very often at the hospital and know the quality of the health system, the quality of doctors and nurses and watch how carefully treat foreign people and try to do the best..Please Comet, be careful!"
Some people believe in Santa clause and others like to bury their heads in the sand so to advise a 85 year old he will be looked after in Greece if they’re is a break out as there will be is utterly negligent and irresponsible ::Who has never lived in Greece???
"Comet, I said I agree with Alabastron, we don't recommend older people to travel in this situation.I insist in my opinion. Sorry, comet, but you are so WRONG!"

"Nice words about the Greek health system Dimitris, but only the last sentence is relevant. Without capacity the preceding words are more or less irrelevant,"
"Such experience as I’ve had with the Greek health system in Crete has been good experience. But that is irrelevant. No health system, however good, is good enough to guarantee recovery from COVID-19 if an 85-year-old person catches it. The point is that it makes no sense to take the risk of catching it if the risk can be avoided. Travelling is one of the greatest risks, and - in the case of pleasure-travelling - it is entirely avoidable."
Czech have now closed it's borders to travellers. It is ramping up in the UK. Our Government admit it is out of control and have adopted the approach to level out the steep rise to keep our NHS with enough beds to cope with the worse cases.Italy deaths against recovery are at 45% today which is fearful but we don't know how many have caught it in a mild form to lower that figure.
"#79 Dimitris - what do you mean by me being ""out of topic"" ? I consider my views to be sensible and considered. And while I'm on I'd like to big up our NHS in the UK, and on that basis if I was to contract coronavirus I would wish to be at home with family rather than many miles away. No disrespect at all to the Greek health system. I wish you luck in Crete. I am due there in June and July. Here's hoping."

"Maurice, you say ""we have..."" but either you don't live in Crete or you don't speak English.We don't have three cases in West Crete now..."
This is so true and hopefully we will be in Elounda for Easter
If your government says you can't fly then your insurance will then cover your costs.

"Post #92 nobody knows, the situation is changing by the day, possibly by the hour. No one can predict what it will be like in May. From what I have read/heard on the BBC this predicament will last for at least the next 12 - 14 weeks in the UK alone.

"Elenakotronaki all I was trying to point out in saying that the 85 year old traveller does not know how the Greek Health system works is that he does not know how the system works no aspersions if it is a good system or not.

"I don't suggest older people to travel right now.Comet, I am often at the hospital, or private doctors, and saw many times the health system to give priority to foreigns.Sometimes they are very old, or alone, or too drunk, but everyone was helping them. There are also many private clinics, as Dimitris said before.If I don't know how to use the health system of another country ( Australia, Italy, India, etc) doesn't mean that I should not travel there.It is a global problem now, and governments and doctors suggest people to stay home at least for 15 days.Edited: 2:39 am, March 14, 2020 "
"No chance of May. Its only a matter of weeks before there will be a worldwide travel ban which I expect to last well into next year unless a vaccine is found before then.

I have just read in the press that the Greek Government has ordered all bars and restaurants to close. Is this correct as it would seriously impact on our holiday if the tavernas were closed?
"Restaurants cafés and bars will be closed for 15 days from today.But, bakeries, ""take away"" and delivery of food will be open."
"Yes that is correct. These news sites are useful to keep updated.http://www.ekathimerini.com and https://www.athensvoice.gr/, https:/… . Athens Voice you have to use google translate, other two are in English."
"Sorry badly phrased, other one is https://greekreporter.com/."
We are booked to go in April. Currently tavernas are closed for one or two weeks. Two cases on the island both from outside nothing yet on anything transmitted within the island population. Unless CV takes off on Crete we will go
Ok thanks everyone. We are booked for one week self catering in a studio at the end of April. Eating out is a big part of the experience. Guess we will have to wait and see what happens.
"Given that Cyprus has stopped flights, it could be a possibility that the same happens in Crete."
It's happening in Spain and Canaries . Jet2 have stopped flights and planes turned around in mid flight this morning.
"We have our wedding booked for 7th June in Rethymno, we have been planning for over a year so I am keeping my fingers crossed that all works out.Only time will tell."
I'll keep my fingers crossed for you Sophie. As though things weren't already stressful for you.

Is Crete free from coronavirus and can we ah'll travel in may
"Unfortunately no.Please read the previous replies.Edited: 1:04 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"This has been added to the other thread by Periscope and for me sums it up well and is not influenced by a persons business on here""Look around in Europe. Denmark has closed its borders for all foreigners. Italy dont allow their own inhabitants to leave their homes. All Greek restaurants are so far closed for the next two weeks. The Norwegian Ministry of foreign affairs have given travel advice : Do not travel. If you are abroad : come home. Airports around Europe are like ghost towns. Flights are cancelled. The Norwegian travel insurance companies say . Come home or your insurance is not valid for the next month. It will certainly be worse before it gets better. It doesn't matter if Crete is an island. The virus doesn't know borders, and it travels by airplanes. It travelled very fast from China to Italy. It came into Norway by plane following Norwegian ski tourists returning home from Italy.. Everybody should stay home until the situation are under control."""
"Dimitris - you need to take the financial hit, sadly. Encouraging visitors is not the answer. Your personal views are unbalanced. I'm gonna lose money (not as much as you), but in my view any visits at the present time are verging on the reckless, and likely to put back any future recovery. We tourists may well have to be cruel to be kind."
"“any visits at the present time are verging on the reckless, and likely to put back any future recovery. We tourists may well have to be cruel to be kind.”Michael G, sadly I think you may be right. I have just read that the UK Govt predict the outbreak (in the UK) may not peak until 14 weeks from now, so any lock downs in Greece in the next few weeks will be in vain IF tourists are allowed to flock in after that."
This will all be moot if the airlines aren't flying. No one will be going anywhere.
"#122 - my previous post removed. Not sure why, just commenting on the obvious in my view about local businesses having to unfortunately take a financial hit. #124 - Wydcombe, having quoted me, yours may also disappear."
"Hi it's understandable your concerns, go with the flow,I'm sure the airline history will be governed by what's happening around the world,, we all in the same boat,,Or plane,"
#125. How very true Ginesy21. My thoughts entirely.
"Tourist accommodation throughout Greece has now been closed by the government until the end of April, which will no doubt help any of you deciding on whether to visit Greece this Spring. Effective from tomorrow. I hope this helps."
I also am going to crete on may4th but not sure if it will be cancelled
Does that mean all of Greece and the surrounding islands? Santorini in particular. The hotel told me I have to decide by March 19th if I want any sort of money back. I was going to be there April 25th.
This means all of Greece so yes it includes Santorini. But it is for seasonal tourist accommodation and presumably not hotels that are open all year round. It sounds like they are trying to stop the hordes of tourists arriving on package holidays for now.I would not be surprised if this is extended into May and beyond.
I'm fairly certain most of Santorini hotels are not open all year round. I know the one in particular we are staying at is only open from April-October.
"#136. I think your fate is sealed in that case then Brad. The hotel won’t be opening its doors until end April earliest.....and getting to Santorini is another matter altogether.Edited: 1:23 am, March 15, 2020 "
"I’m due to fly out in the 2nd April, the government sent me a email yesterday saying Greece’s restaurants bars etc are on lockdown but not sure if this would be the case in Crete, I’m going to my travel agents today to find out what there stance on it is, as I’m sure Crete will close there boarders to the uk as we have more cases then them and I would hate to be in lockdown on holiday, will update you with what my travel agent advises"
Been told by my sister who lives in Crete that no accommodation can open until MayAlso only supermarkets and chemists open and restaurants are takeaway only.
"#138 Only supermakets, pharmacies and take away places are open. Not to mention hotels that they are going to open in May, hopefully. Why would Crete differ from the rest of Greece?Edited: 5:18 am, March 15, 2020 "
"#138 ""I’m sure Crete will close there boarders""For your information, Crete is part of Greece, it's not a separate country.""the government sent me a email yesterday""The Greek government? How would they have your email? Are you on government business?Edited: 5:23 am, March 15, 2020 "
"In all honesty, should anyone in the UK or elsewhere (where covid 19 is bigging up day on day) even consider leaving our shores, and potentially infecting the lovely people of Crete ? It is a pretty selfish sentiment in my view. We should all stay put, until this disease has been sorted. And I'm due to lose 2 great holidays in the weeks to come, sadly."
"As I keep saying, I don't think anyone will have a choice soon. If there's no accommodation and no flights, we'll all be spending our holidays in our own homes."
Better check also the Greece TripAdvisor forum and the thread : UK Government alert
"@JeanCreteWell said.Why would someone think that if GREECE's restaurants & bars are in lockdown, it wouldn't apply to CRETE?"
"Alliwhiting didn't know that, or thinking/hoping that may be something else is applying here in Crete.But, the same for all Greece, and many other countries..."
"Alli, I don't think it is a decision your travel agent can have any influence over."
">>Why would someone think that if GREECE's restaurants & bars are in lockdown, it wouldn't apply to CRETE?<<Somebody asked on the Santorini forum if the mesures taken by the Greek govenment applied to Santorini too. Apparently this virus attacks some people's brain too."
"We are booked in with Love Holidays over Easter, flying with Ryanair. We've heard from our hotel in Chania that all hotels are to close til 30th April. But I can't find official info on this."
Have a look at posts on the main Greek forum. One of those will contain a link with official information for sure.
"#148 ""But I can't find official info on this.""Here is a screenshot of the official info (obviously that will be in Greek but you asked for official) haniotika-nea.gr/media/2020/03/Screenshot-20…"
Thanks..but just can't find anything!
"""Thanks..but just can't find anything!""What exactly are you looking for?"
I understand from link below that most public places are closed now in Greece. It would make sense that hotels would be included in this restriction. But I have yet to find this confirmation on any official site...only heard from forums and an email from the hotel whom we are booked in with.We have time yet to gather more information/proof of cancellation before we travel..but itd be good to know for sure.https:/…coronavirus
I’m sorry if this isn’t in the right place but I’m trying to find out whether the Mitsis Rinela will be closed as I’m booked to stay there in 2 weeks and right now I can’t get any information about this from the Rinela or Loveholidays. All love holidays are saying is there is no travel advice for Greece so as it stands all holidays will still be taking place. Any help would be much appreciated.
#156 Simple words. All seasonal accommodation is closed until 30th April. The one you mentioned is no exception.
Thank you- now just to try and get my money back.
"I live in Crete. We are RESTRICTED. Only grocery stores, bakeries and pharmacies are open. Everything else is closed, including hotels and restaurants. People have been arrested for being open against the new COVID19 restrictions. Restaurants are allowed to do take out only."
"Actuelly I am in Athens on vacation: all the museums are closed,shops and restaurants as well. Very few people outside.Schools, universities etc the same."
This article has links to the govt. document. https:/…
"Like you my wife & I are travelling to Crete (Chania) in late April & concerned about restrictions when get there as well as the obvious one of flight cancellations. Currently the Greek Gov have closed schools, Unis, restaurants & bars for several weeks but you wonder that if we all can get there it will be worth e.g. is anything gonna be open?!"
More to the point.....is your hotel going to be open? All tourist accommodation closed now until end April.
"No one knows what the situation will be. Just to add one thing,you need to check also if your hotel is going to be open."
"Hi Kim I am planning to come to Crete April 27th, I’ve booked Serita beach hotel. I can’t get any response from them. Are they open do you know if? I would appreciate your help. Regards."
"#166 Call them tomorrow. The hotel,like all the others, is not going to open till the 30th April (at least)."
"Hayley. Might help if you say which resort and, even better, also post on that dedicated forum. Whether the hotel is open now or not (may well not be as it’s a beach hotel), it’ll have to close on the 23rd March until end of April anyway, in line with government restrictions."
I'm going to Crete may 4 th unless I'm banned by the government in still going I look at it this way if ya fan get it I'll get it and praise God so far it ain't there so hopefully I'll be ok
Will they be back open by may 4 th

We go may 9th keeping everything crossed! x
I am in the same situation and praying airlines do not stop flying there. I love Easter in Crete.
#176 So the main problem for you is if the airlines are still flying around Easter?
"I doubt you will have any choice. I am holding on to my own vacation in May, just in case a genuine miracle happens. But, while this is a disappointment to me, for locals the virus is a threat to their livelihood and I genuinly feel sorry for them and Hope it won't take too Long to recover"
"Can those on here who are fretting about not getting their holidays in Crete get a grip. We in the UK are experiencing increasingly significant increases day on day. Why would anyone even consider potentially passing covid 19 into Crete? A lock down is the only viable option, like it or not. Do not be in denial. Please consider the health of the Cretan population, and don't give the economy as an argument. Short termism is not the solution. No more on this subject from me, some of you will be pleased to know."
"I won't be pleased, Michael G. You have consistently been one of the voices of reason on the forum, so I hope you will continue to be so. Fortunately the false, empty reassurances that it's ok to travel have mostly stopped; but we are still getting posts every day from people who seem to have no idea of what is going on in the world, and are thinking of nothing but their holidays.""Why would anyone even consider potentially passing covid 19 into Crete? A lock down is the only viable option, like it or not. Do not be in denial.

Thank you Alabastron. Your support is very reassuring.
"#182. Are you joking? You surely must be.....and where is it you are hoping to stay? Tourist resort hotels/accommodation’s closed until end of April at least, with any currently open emptying of guests and closing their doors by 23rd March. Don’t know where you originate from but I’d be amazed if you’re welcomed in Crete this April. Think of others and stay home.Edited: 12:33 am, March 16, 2020 "
Thank you
"I am sorry if I seemed more worried about my vacation than the health issues following the corona virus. I am not. I had just realised the devestating effect the lock-down in norway already have on Peoples lives. Somthing I would expect is far worse in countries without ""oilmoney"" and social benefits system. I fully support the decision made by over our goverment - and it is not realistic to expect a vaccine or a cure in the near future, which is the miracle I was refering to. So to put it bluntly- If the greek goverment does not close downn the borders to tourists, and Airlines continues to carry potentitial decease bombs, we should all be responsible enough to stay where we are. This virus kills People, and not in a peacefull way! Stay safe"
"We are booked for mid- May.If the plane flies, we are on it"
Ian Jarman the plane aint flying and you wont be on it.
#188 LOL Comet - I can see people on this message board that appear to normally have quite a long fuse now starting to get really fed up with other people’s selfishness. Shocking how so many don’t seem to care at all sadly. I feel your response in the main is totally correct though - common sense tells *most* of us this pandemic simply won’t be a distant memory of the past in a few weeks time. The evidence strongly supports quite the opposite. There won’t be planes and holidays then. People need to wake up.
"If you loved Crete, you wouldn't contemplate a holiday there until things change dramatically."
HiI am sure that coronavirus will go away in due time but what will stay for ever is the jealousy virus!
Totally sympathetic about taking a global view here.In terms of claiming on the insurance they will only pay out if FCO advises against travel. So if FCO do not advise in such a way but the Greek Authorities insist we self isolate for 14 days what is one to do?
Anyone flying with Jet2 won't be going anywhere. No flights until the 1st of May at the earliest.
Im due to fly out in August. Just cant see it happening. Just hope this awful virus is controlled and lives lost are kept to a minimum. The vaccine is needed lets hope its available sooner rather than later.Stay safe.
"I was due to come out to Crete from UK from 22 Apr to 02 May. This would be my 4th holiday in Crete. I respect the decision of Greek Government to protect the Greek people from the spread of COVID-19 and will postpone my holiday until such time that it's safe to do so.I am a little staggered by the ignorance of one of two people who've posted on here previously who seem adamant they are still going ahead with their holiday as planned, regardless of the current situ."
"Tbh, it isn't up to the people who say they'll still go. No flights and no where to stay will mean they can't. I've said this before and I'll say it again. This is a fluid situation, things are changing daily. No one knows what will happen in even a few weeks time."
We are due to fly out on 3rd april not sure what to do or what happening yet
I don't think you are going to fly.
janineoSan Francisco... HI is your husband still going of or has he accepted he lost his six Grand . Much better for you though
"@ Dimitri""I am sure that coronavirus will go away in due time but what will stay for ever is the jealousy virus!""I'm confused about your comment.Who is jealous of who?"
"ΗiThings change not daily but by the hour.I got angry and I deleted more than 15 of my posts in this thread because someone called me a liar.All of my 15 posts were according to the, at that time, information and my priority was people not to get panicked and take wrong steps and maybe because of that, they lost money.The specific post mentioned that Porto Veneciano is closed and I called the hotel and the reception manager told me that ""they close for the next two weeks"".Few hours later the Greek gov issued an order that ""all seasonal hotels and let rooms"" must close till 30 April and all of them that have already customers must close the latest 23 of March.Till today, I get mails or questions in messenger from the people know me better and ask my advise about the COVID19 and I tell them to check the cancelation policy with all providers of their holidays, like airplane companies, hotels or Airbnb, car rentals and bike rentals, boats and other excursion or activities (diving, snorkling, jeep safari, quad safari, boat trips, water parks etc) and then they take decision what to do next.What to cancel immediatelly and what they have time to wait till the situation finishes with the hope it will finish earlier than expected.Edited: 5:27 am, March 17, 2020 "
"That is much clearer Dimitris. In fairness some over here observed you as a King Canute 12th century type figure (not sure if you are aware of him in Crete). The episode is frequently referred to where the futility of ""trying to stop the tide"" of an inexorable event is pointed out. We, like many on your island, are desperately sad for the predicament that you and others closely aligned to the tourism trade find yourselves in. You can rest assured that when this dreadful disease is over, we will endeavour to get Crete back on its feet by visiting even more regularly. Good luck to you and fellow Cretans."
"I am due to travel to Crete on April 22nd. Yesterday I read that the Greek government has imposed a quarantine on all visitors to Greece and the islands for 14 days, as from yesterday March 16th.No one wants to spend their holiday in quarantine. Yet I see that Easy Jet, Love Holidays and Jet2 are still selling flights and holidays to Greece and the Greek islands. Surely this is dishonest, unethical and illegal."
"Hi , I have a holiday booked in June and I'd cancelled my room as booked through booking.com with free cancellation till May, will see what is going on with the flight , looks like they are given vouchers to book within a year ,British airways. I won't go somewhere where you are put straight on self isolation ,,what's the point for going? Doesn't matter money lost , I can't afford to be stranded somewhere; also non of travel insurer aren't covering for coronavirus and looks like will be months now until things are getting betterEdited: 4:19 am, March 18, 2020 "
And you wouldn't want to come to Crete and infect all the lovely Cretan people would you.

"Two Kiwis travelling.We have been in Greece since 25 Feb. Left Corfu on 15 March and flew to Crete as we looked to sit out virus. Planed to stay month but now looking at two months. The people on the island are being very responsible taking lockdown seriously. Super market this morning controlled entry and people stayed a good metre apart. No shortage of anything at all. Checkout operators wore gloves and people did not queue closely.We have an amazing apartment, sun is shining,, have a full bottle of wine just cant go out yet.Looking forward to end of lock down."
Crete is on strict quarantine! Everything is closed except supermarkets and pharmacies. Stay away!

I have visited Crete 6 times, and been happy to spend my hard earned cash there. I hope you are also a seasoned Cretan traveller. Come the good times, I'll be back again supporting the local economy.

"Greece cloes its borders to Non-EU Citizens. In addition most other European countries closes their borders to non-nationals. In addition the airlines cancelling lot of flights.

"I want to add something important and beg for this.In Chania and Chania Prefecture, we don't have yet ANY confirmed cases!(only one foreign soldier that was for a few days in a military school in MARATHI) and after some days, when he was back in his country, did inform that school, that he was positive, but in the meantime he went also to Athens, instanbul and six hours flight. So we don't know if he was positive while here) We try to do everything to keep our place ""clean"" from the virus. I mean to say that all Europeans that arrived here these days, HAVE to self isolate for 14 days! We hope for responsibility."

Exactly
"Stay home, it will not finish the pandemic."
Because of people with your mentality we have so many cases of Covid - 19 in the world. When you will understand that this virus is very contagious?
Just got last flight out of Crete 20/3/20 and have been informed there are no more flights or ferries in or out so Crete is a no go place. Pity as it's a beautiful Island.
"""Just got last flight out of Crete 20/3/20 and have been informed there are no more flights or ferries in or out so Crete is a no go place. ""As far as I can see planes are still flying between Athens, Chania and Heraklion on a limited time-table so your information is not correct."
ΗιIt is fantastic that the TA staff has sense of humor and they reinstat the post 225
"To me, Dimitris, your post 225 reflected, in very difficult times, your love for the island of Crete, nothing sinister about it, and I hope my subsequent response also showed the same, whilst still acknowledging the very serious challenge faced by the island, as indeed is true of the whole world.Stay well.....stay in!!"
"I do find TA policing of this forum puzzling at times. On occasions when my post has been factual and well meaning some have been surprisingly deleted. On other occasions when perhaps some posts deserved to be deleted (sorry folks), they have been retained. Ah well, keeps us on our toes I suppose. Stay well everyone. Hopefully we'll all be flocking back to Crete in 2021. I reckon 2020 is a non starter. I expect we will be paying increased prices, but no problem with that to make up the 2020 losses. (Just wondering if this post will be deleted, mischievous of me of course)"
"#264. I certainly hope your post will not be deleted Michael G. It is factual, family friendly and on-topic.Yes, I too think the days of cheap holidays might come to an end, though market forces might determine otherwise when companies are trying to build trade up again.Keep safe in the meantime."
"Hi Yes, of course, your love for Crete is very clear!And I am sure that all members who write posts in Crete forum have love for Crete, even if sometimes they have a very strange way of showing it.Even members who do not miss an opportunity to fight my status, I believe that they love Crete the same as all of us.The thing that is incomprehensible to me is why they do not open up other topics and express their sympathy or peculiarity for the companies they prefer but are concerned with what a company does that anyway they do not prefer for their own reasons.A few planes have arrived in recent days with several tourists although it is March and even if they had been informed of all the restrictions on the island.If nothing else I wish them a happy holiday without a hitch!Edited: 6:26 am, March 21, 2020 "
Im not convinced prices will increase that much. Loads of people are going to lose their jobs and suffer financial hardship.Companies will be wary of pricing themselves out.Also a vaccine is likely to be year to 18 months away and even though hopefully we are able to travel there will be loads I feel still wary of being away from home and increased costs not to mention travel insurance and we will no longer be a member of the EU.I really dont see inflated prices.There will be thousands still recovering financially if hopefully the worst is over.The Travel Industry wont want to price itself out.
"Hi Paul, something that I have not seen mentioned on the forums & which many people may have missed is that Gbp has collapsed against the Euro & Usd. Last night it closed on the exchanges at 0.921 against the Euro having touched .83 just a couple of weeks ago. Also, my feeling is that, the longer this goes on, airlines may collapse taking capacity out. If that happens & there is less competitìon, it may actually drive up prices"
"#268. I echo your thinking with regards to the possibility of reduced future airline capacity. It’s a tough prediction to make at the moment. Just need to keep safe in the meantime, make sure we’re around to enjoy another holiday, whenever that may be.Dimitris.....surely those recent tourists arriving in Crete have had to self isolate, and where are they going to stay?Edited: 7:45 am, March 21, 2020 "
"Gaildorfblues, it's certainly going to be tough for a lot of smaller airlines, and indeed some of the bigger ones come to that. I just hope that the measures being taken now by all countries minimise the risk to people and see us all through this safely."
"Hi twinkletoes, the flip side though is that the price of oil has also collapsed which should help the airlines. So many imponderables, Gbp exchange rate, price of oil, possible reduced number of flights & then, the big unmentionable, how many people will simply be no longer prepared to fly to anywhere again"
"Ginesy, amen to that, spot on."

"My posts at #277 and 278 deleted. My comments were in relation to dimitris' comment #276 that Heraklion Airport was ""really empty"". I really do query whether his post was useful. Perhaps so, if you live in a bubble I suppose."
Please don't travel to Crete unless you have to. A holiday is not essential travel. We have an ageing population who are at a high risk of developing complications and travellers coming through busy international hubs is the key source of infections. Please think about the elderly in the villages of Crete who will not have easy access to medical care if you accidentally infect them on your travels.
Rebecca A. I agree with you and though it is sad to have cancelled our trip for 29 May we wholeheartedly wish to send our regards from London to all of the wonderful Cretan people that we have encountered in the past 3 years.In the UK people are being asked not to travel from London to places where they have 2nd homes as the risk of infection is just too high. Rural communities often have fewer specialist care facilities in the UK and we should all be minded to travel only when necessary.
"Thank you Rebecca.Thank you SWLL. Big heart, open mind."
"I can’t see anything mentioned in post 266 which identifies the recent tourists who arrived as being British. But, that fact is of no consequence in reality. Unless people are resident on the island and are returning to their main home, they just shouldn’t be there. I do hope that anyone returning to Crete, irrespective of nationality, is following the requirement to self isolate. No-one is immune to this virus.Edited: 1:44 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"123twinkletoes, you asked where are they going to stay, that's why I said ""second home or friend's home or villa""Dimitris didn't say British. I mentioned British only because i saw them, by chance, and because in my area many of them keep residences ( Kalyves, Vamos, Gavalohori, kokkino Horio etc.and I know it's the majority of foreigns here now. The nationality doesn't matter of course.The only matter is : respect.Take care!Edited: 2:30 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"HiClarify for post 266The most of them were inland flights from Athens or Thessaloniki.I am not sure if was also from Rhodes or other Greek city.So I don't know where the tourists came from.Maybe in between were also flights from outland and did not fall into my perception.If I understand well they were from different nationalities.Edited: 2:32 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"#286/287. Thank you both for the clarifications. I can’t imagine why anyone, no matter their origin, would want to leave their main home elsewhere, at a time like this, travel to Crete (or anywhere else) and risk infecting other people. Even if they self isolate on arrival, they have sat with others on a plane and risked becoming unwell themselves. Yes, agreed, respect.....and fortunately, the majority of us do.Keep safe!"
with over a thousand deaths in Italy and Spain alone today and set to double every two days nobody should be going anywhere.
I saw a Transavia plane went from Amsterdam to Heraklion today. But maybe that was just to pick up stranded travellers.
Let’s hope so Nicksy. To beat the deadline I guess.
"Indeed, they went empty and only picked up Dutch travellers in Greece who want to go home before all boarders are closed."
Stay home. Lock downs in every country and town around the world. You will not be able to get out. I have cancelled my trip to Greece and the islands. Sad. Was looking forward to the 7th trip to Greece. Review in August this year.
We going end of may and still not sure what to do at mo. They say its safe but trying to find out if its shutting its tours and beaches down
"""still not sure what to do at mo""Then you're in good company. There are probably a few billions of people who are not quite sure either.Unless you have a good prophet nearby (as far as I can see there aren't any on this forum) you probably want to wait and see.Edited: 6:52 am, March 22, 2020 "
"We have a hotel booked for the middle of May that can be cancelled early May without charge.We have booked flights with Jet 2.Until Jet 2 make a decision on cancelling flights we are a bit up in the air.With all restaurants, bars, cafes. leisure centres and now a lot of department stores (John Lewis etc) closing .I can't see us travelling - that rests with Jet 2."
"#296. Fortunately, you will know before early May if Greece is extending its travel restriction dates and you can still cancel your room without charge. (The Greek government won’t leave it until 30th April to announce changes). Jet2 will also know where they stand then.Personally, I can’t see us being clear of this virus by mid May and not for months yet."
"Hi 123twinkletoesOne of my concern is that even if Greece is clear by mid May from the covid19, UK or the States and others are they clear too ?Edited: 8:03 am, March 22, 2020 "
"Hi Dimitris That is probably a question that nobody can give a definite answer to at the moment. Unfortunately, very few here in Ireland think that it will be cleared for quite a few months, certainly beyond May & we are on virtual lockdown here & have been since last weekend."
"I guess, even IF Greece would be clear by mid-May they will not allow people coming in from countries that are not free at that moment. And that would be the right thing to do of course.."
For me - No movement at all until this monster is totally (globally) eradicated. Don't even consider weeks and months. Batten down the hatches everyone. Stay safe. Dream about the future.

"It's hard to understand why so many people still don't realise that the decision about whether to go on holiday in May has been made for them. This pandemic will not be under control by May, probably not even by the end of the summer. Governments that have succeeded in keeping their countries relatively free of the virus will not lift the restrictions that have made that possible. That includes Greece, and Crete is part of Greece. Nobody will be going to Crete in May. If it were possible to surmount the obstacles - no flights, 14 days quarantine - and somehow get there, it would be completely irresponsible to travel to Crete from a country that remains a source of contagion - and that will include the UK and the UK, both of whose governments wasted precious weeks before measures were taken to try to control the virus. It will be several months before it is under control. The UK Prime Minister, who isn't known for his dedication to the truth or to accuracy, is talking about ""12 weeks"". I think that can be understood as wishful thinking (and it probably isn't even what he thinks). It is almost certain to be longer.Let's be glad that the Greek government had the sense to clamp down before the virus took hold, let's hope they've succeeded in keeping the infection away, or at least mild, and let's be thankful that Crete will be there, and its people healthy and well and ready to welcome us, when we can finally be there again.Edited: 9:09 am, March 22, 2020 "
"Alabastron is wise, I suggest to read carefully what she is saying.Now, and for some months ""it's the end of the world as we know it"""
"Hi Alabastron our Prime Minister said 12 weeks to turn the tide under pressure from the Press. Turning the tide of course does not mean virus free. We are said to be two weeks away from Italy which is horrendous. We will not be going anywhere in these coming months. Hope Athens keeps it low but we were only in those figures ourselves two weeks ago. We are of course a multinational country with people from all over the world living here and I guess an impossible task to hold it at bay.Edited: 9:21 am, March 22, 2020 "

Sadly, despite stark warnings, I still see hordes of people, varying from young families to groups of elderly people, out in the streets and the shops where I live. It’s as if it’s all fallen on deaf ears. Not least the people who still talk of taking holidays in the next few months!! The selfish attitude of these people is responsible for putting themselves and others at risk, including the healthcare workers they will rely on when they get the virus. No doubt these same people will be the first to complain when the already very overstretched NHS (and other health care systems throughout the world) are unable to cope with them or their family’s needs as numbers escalate due to their irresponsible & selfish behaviour."
"""I'm actually frustrated and angry about people still looking forward to their Cretan Summer break. Get a grip folk.""Looking forward to something is very important in such a situation where you need something positive.. The fact that it is probably unrealistic doesn't really matter...as long as they stay at home and follow the rules that apply to where they live until these are lifted."
HiJust now the Greek Prime Minister announced that from tomorrow morning we have a total lockdown.
Looking forward to your Summer 2020 Cretan holiday is not positive JeanCrete. It is unrealistic. Looking forward to your 2021 Cretan holiday is much more positive and realistic.
"A logical decision, Dimitris if I read this and see the picture from the beach. https:/…"
"Yes, this mass exodus had previously come to light and discussed earlier. Hard to believe people are still doing this quite honestly. I can imagine it being a problem in other virus-hit countries too. I would just add that, at the present time in the UK, we are being encouraged to walk out for some exercise, which I have done today, keeping (at least) the required minimum of 2 metres away from anyone I passed and spoke to. What folks shouldn’t be doing is grouping together at any time, nor moving out of area if at all possible, work needs excepted. My daughter in law is a nurse. They are at the very sharp end of this, along with many others in the NHS. Heartfelt pleas from them to follow government guidelines should be heeded otherwise we’ll end up in total lockdown too.Keep safe everybody."
Ive been out for a walk today as well.What ive seen isnt great. Play areas open with children (and some adults) on swings slides etcA campervan with what looked like 2 families all sat round in deck chairs eating and drinking in a car park.I walked from my home. Loads had taken cars to get out and about.Pictures of tourist spots all over the country where people have driven to get to beaches etc and queuing for their takeaways.Stronger government intervention is needed. Urgently.
"Just watched Boris’s latest news conference. Why he still wants to be Mr Nice Guy is beyond me, I am trying to work out the strategy. There’s a little voice in my head saying that now the government is taking special steps to protect the most vulnerable, they are allowing the rest enough freedom to get a mild dose (they hope!) of the virus and build up a herd immunity. What else can behind letting people still congregate, as they clearly are doing.....and the government already has clear evidence of this?I am lucky enough to live in a village (albeit a large one) but at least there is enough space around, with forethought, to distance oneself 2 metres from other people when out getting some exercise. Pity others aren’t observing this simple rule.Time will tell, sadly, it’ll be too late for some.Edited: 12:32 pm, March 23, 2020 "
"Hello, I have a trip booked to Crete in mid-May that I have been looking forward to for months! As such, I can't think clearly and keep hoping that things will somewhat 'blow over' by then. I am looking for some guidance (and probably a reality check) - do I need to postpone my trip (I'm sure this is a yes)? If so, the real question: to when??? It's so hard to know what to do. Thanks in advance."
"Hello Sam. I'm sorry, but it won't blow over, and I doubt there is any possibility of your being able to go to Crete in May. If you want a reality check I suggest you read through this whole thread: it's long, but when you've finished you'll have a better understanding of what's going on in the world.No-one can tell you when you might be able to come, because no-one in the world knows when the pandemic is going to end.Edited: 5:54 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"Sam W, as already said in #325 you won't get to Crete in May 2020. This is not going to blow over. You also don't want to be visiting anywhere that risks taking the virus home.Nobody knows how long this will impact travel for but I think it is safe to say in 3 months time some countries might be getting through the worst of it. But after that the global impact on finance is the next problem. This will be a bigger impact to the world economy that the financial meltdown in 2008, SARS, MERS, etc. Maybe worse than all those combined.We have difficult times ahead. But stay safe and healthy in Zimbabwe and just continue planning for this trip for whenever it happens.How are you booked though? I assume from Zimbabwe it is independent travel so flights via Athens, hotels, etc. So how do you stand for cancelling hotels for example if and when you need to? Flights might be refunded."
Here's an interesting article that shows just how serious things are not just for health but for business.https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-an…
"Some big issues here. Not least the fact that people entered into the contract with the company on the understanding that the cash refund rules would apply... but the critical thing is that that if there are changes then they will be 100% guaranteed by the State, and if we don't have this type of change, then there may not be any airlines or travel companies to take us anywhere next year."
"What about insurance companies that will not pay out if the virus returns. They are already changing their terms and conditions. One might even develop an illness during two years which is not insurable. The Ehic card validation will also disappearEdited: 7:12 am, March 23, 2020 "
HiI am not sure ( I am 99%) but I think that the insurance companies don't cover in pandemic situation.
Im supposed to go 1st August.I fully expect the flight to be cancelled and to get a refund. Have travel insurance with a bank account so if they do fly and i cant go due to coronavirus im covered this year.Next year and the years ahead coronavirus cancellations wont be covered so there will be added costs to get a policy that covers it.Also we are no longer in the EU.Getting the travel insurance correct in the coming years whatever the cost is going to be essential.
HiThere are exeptions of course.The connection between UK and EU stops on 31 December.
Thank you to all the contributors - especially those living on Crete.This would have been our first visit to Crete - hopefully we will be able to visit in May 2021.
"Why does everyone seems so certain that the complete 2020 tourism season will go to waste?China has the virus under control after 3 months.Who says that the situation for a majority of the European countries wouldnt be stable in july?Even if some countries are still dealing with the problem for a longer time, like UK, Netherlands and maybe Spain, Germany... Who says that travel can't restart from and to those countries who have the virus under control?There are lots of countries who are treating the virus situation rather well: Greece, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, ... just to name a few."
Because after three months China has not got rid of it and cases are starting to rise again with more cases and deaths. Would you accept Chinese tourist to come to your country at the moment. I am sure if China allowed a free for all it would completely go out of control. Also bear in mind China can throw any amount of equipment and hospitals at it while an area is lock downhttps:/…countries
"You say China has the virus under control. Really? Take a look at this site for accurate information. The virus might be under control but has not yet been eradicated.New cases are still arising because, unfortunately, some of the people returning to China have brought the virus back with them. I personally can’t see any European country taking the same risk, knowing full well thousands of holidaymakers from all over will flock in.I would be very happy if your optimism is indeed justified!!www.worldometers.info"
"agree twinkletoes,A vaccine is the best hope"
"Totally agree,we will desperately miss our twice yearly visits, six weeks in total but if that is what it takes to keep everyone in Crete safe, so be it, and it will make next year extra special."
"What I was saying might seem ungenerous, but don't be mistaken, I understand that the UK is a huge market for the Greeks and if you guys won't be able travel this summer, it will effect the whole of europe. I absoluty wish for the contrary.But I'm trying to look at it from another perspective. As most of the contributors to this forum are from the UK, I have a feeling that the situation isn't being addressed completely objectively and extremely pessimistic.I'm sure China will see domestic tourism this year. Europe isn't like China, but i wish to remain hopefull. At least for the sake of the people that depend on tourism.China's numbers currently are very low. Okay, there are 30 reported cases more than yesterday. But industries are restarting operations. Air traffic is increasing again. Chinese people are returning to their home country and there are A LOT of Chinese people. 30 or so more infections one day doesn't mean that they're losing their grip on the situation."

Whether traveling in such a world is smart or not (especially if you have a risk profile) is another discussion.Why does one expert say summer season will be delayed while another one says there will be none?

My personal view is that irrespective of the ongoing economic disaster, countries will be loathe to reopen their borders for a significant time (certainly not in terms of weeks) following a downturn or complete absence in CV. I don't regard late Summer as a viable prospect.Sadly, a good number, particularly the elderly / high risk may not even consider medium / long haul holidays as a future option."
"Be prepare, to get locked down, not get home for weeks and catch the virus whilst out there. I know where I would prefer to be, but common sense has to prevail in these uncertain times."
"HiIf Greece till the end of April is clean from the virus(in case nothing changes, with the rise of the virus), we can open our bordes to countries that are also clean from the virus, only via flight.Life must continue....!Edited: 6:50 am, March 25, 2020 "
"I'm intrigued and astonished by Dimitris' view which seems to be influenced more by economic (tourist) rather than public health issues. ""Life must go on"" he comments. Only by radical lock downs will this be possible. And here's to hoping life will go on.I am also interested which ""clean countries"" will be visiting Crete ?And he mentions the end of April ? - that is 36 days away !!! Time for realism methinks."
"The truth of the matter is that no one knows what's going to happen. So, it could be months, weeks or even a year before anything returns to normal."
"No, those key points are formulated from a UK perpective. But think of it as you wish, so will I."
"Some people need a reality check, this virus is not going away anytime soon. If we can get rid of this thing, I will feel lucky if I can travel safely in 2021 without this being still around or coming back again."
I can't see why you think Belgium is doing any better than us. It's looking pretty bad for your country as well as ours

My response to Dimitris #359 (ie #360 quickly deleted) was to query his views1. I considered his post is more influenced by Crete's economy (tourism) rather than public health issues?2. Crete opening its borders at the end of April - 36 days away is ludicrous3. Which are these clean countries?4. Life will only continue if we deal with CV seriously.Can the moderator please let me know why the above is inappropriate please? I have my suspicion who might be deleting my posts. Can you confirm please.

"There are a few things eminent in this crisis.The 'exist strategic' most countries have is indeed flatten the curve which can be attained after +-8 weeks of lockdown. Then countries will go into the 'control phase' and measures can be lifted one by one, not radically and with respect to the incubation period. (This won't eradicate the virus, but it would Bring it under control to relieve the health sector and restore (parts of) our normal lives. Risky groups still have to be very cautious of course).-> Now the sooner a government goes lockdown after the initial Corona cases are reporter, the faster the 'flatten the curve' will be attained and the more manageable the situation remains. (See South Korea)Some countries understood this quite fast. Norway, Denmark and some Balkan countries like Greece, Albania and Montenegro for example. Belgium hesitated a bit, but still acted relatively quickly. Another example is Malta.Spain, France and Germany hesitated too long in respect to their first couple of cases and are now facing the consequences. Extra disadvantage here is that they're big countries with very densly populated areas.Now what has happend in the UK (and for example the Netherlands) ? A failed attempt to install horde immunity means that these countries are at least one week behind which might have an enormous effect on the outcome and lenght of the crisis in these respective countries. All these days the virus has been spreading while symptoms arent showing yet.So baxk to Belgium. Why else would Belgium be in a better position than some other countries? We have a significant number of IC beds ánd respiratory machines per capita. For the same reason the death toll in Germany remains pretty low.+our people are relatively well obeying to the rules. This is also a bit a cultural thing.Will these few benefits that we have result in Belgians being able to travel this summer? Maybe not, but if for example Greece and Malta would be able to receive tourism from let's say Norway and Denmark... I don't think of these kind of scenarios as impossible. I understand that it would just be 'a drop in the ocean' for the tourism sector and hotels or even governments may decide to stay closed.Another thing. At first our government applied the 'bring bad news in small steps' method, not to create panic. But they have announced about a week ago that it's better to bring all bad news and drastic decisions at once from now on."

"The UK is far denser than Belgium a small manageable country yet your death rate per million is '15' against the UK of '6'.

"Interpreting this as country bashing is ridiculous.What do you think, that I enjoy seeing your government making questionable decisions with potentially huge negative effects for your people and consequences for the rest of Europe?! No!Do I claim the Belgian government to be first in class?! Neither. But i believe our approach (and of some other countries like Greece etc) will turn out well better for us resulting in -maybe- still some summer travel this year.I just felt like this forum, with reades from accross the world, could use opinion and perspective from other than UK contributors.We are all in this together and i do not mean to offend anyone. Just giving my point of view."
"> i believe our approach (and of some other countries like Greece etc) will turn out well better for us<That may well be true. But I think you are still missing the point: this is a pandemic. That means it affects the entire world: every single country and every single person in the world. It doesn't really matter whether one country or another gets on top of it sooner than other countries. All countries, and all people, will remain at risk, and that is why travel is going to remain - or at least ought to remain - off the table for the foreseeable future.>resulting in -maybe- still some summer travel this year.<As I said earlier - wishful thinking.As was Dimitris' in post 359, alas. His wishful thinking is understandable: he has his business, his livelihood, at stake. But it's still wishful thinking."
HiMy response to #371Michael G I think that you worry for the wrong things.You better you worry with corona virus policy you follow in UK and when UK will be clean rather than my thoughts.What I believe is up to me and I don't think that I invited you to believe my thoughts.
Well we'll see what happens over the next weeks and months. Eventually we can only hope for the best.
"Dimitris - I refer you to your post #309 - and your comment - ""It is a free and democratic forum"".Please accept that others have a view on CV."

"To many of these types sadly as reflected in empty shelves at the Supermarkerts here, it's only a holiday, you could end up losing your life!"
Time for a reality check by some on here I'm afraid
I hope everybody is staying safe and healthy. I live in Chicago-and it is starting to get bad here.I am booked for a June 3 flight-really hoping to make it. We will go unless a 14-day quarantine is still in effect. Never been to Crete(or Greece for that matter). This would have been the first overseas trip that we would have made with our children. Was really looking forward to it.
If it is getting bad in Chicago then even if Greece turns out to be okay unfortunately you won't be travelling there. The USA will still be in lockdown for sure. I don't think it will be your decision to make.To avoid disappointment in June assume the trip is postponed for now to a later date.
I hope that by the time Summer comes we will all have a bit more freedom to enjoy it wherever we are. It's going to take a long time to recover from this and if this time next year we are able to be planning out holidays in Crete I will be very happy.
"IMHO if you want to point the finger, point it at China. They knew about this late last year & downplayed it. Had the rest of the world known quite how serious it was they might have stopped Chinese travellers retuning from Chinese New Year to Europe & beyond. But that's just my opinion."
"I'm having mixed messages. My tour operator is only cancelling and/or changing dates for holidays up to 15th April, our hotel says it's reopening on 1st May but UK government doesn't advise travel for 12 weeks and Greece government says people entering Greece need to be in quarantine for 14 days and carry paperwork showing essential to enter. Im supposed to fly 26 May to Crete but on advice from Which they say not to change dates as I will be hit with fees abd to wait until tour operator cancels and get a refund or change holiday dates but under no circumstances to accept vouchers in case operator goes bust. So I'm playing the waiting game."
"Nobody can predict what the situation will be comes end of May.All current measures in Greece are mentioned in the ""pinned"" post at the top of the general Greece forum. See https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18939…>>My tour operator is only cancelling and/or changing dates for holidays up to 15th April, our hotel says it's reopening on 1st May <<Maybe your hotel says NOW they will be open 1st May but at the end they will have to wait for the decision of the Greek government if the closure of hotels and holiday accommodation will be extended after 30th April or not.My personal opinion is that it will be extended. Same goes for flights to/from the UK that are currently suspended. Again, given the current situation, it would be no surprise at all that will be extended too."
"Just to add to Nicksy’s post, clearly the governments are setting restrictions for a limited period initially but I think these will get extended each month as we see the effects of the virus take hold. Once that happens, the T.O.s and airlines can address those with bookings for the next month or so.No matter the good intentions of any hotel owner, whichever the country, it is the government who will dictate whether or not they can open. So, yes, it’ll be a waiting game, month on month.Personally, I’d assume I wouldn’t being travelling anytime soon but hang on for the provider to cancel."
"Agree with the two posts above, we spoke yesterday with a friend who works at the accommodation we stay in the message from her is that it is definitely one day at a time and wait and see what happens, both her and her husband are employed in hotels.Edited: 8:41 am, March 29, 2020 "
"I love Crete more than anywhere else’s I’ve ever been, and would love nothing more than to be able to visit again this summer. However, anyone on this forum expressing hope they’ll be going there this summer is going to be very disappointed. The Greek government is in no way shape or form going to allow foreigners into the country this summer as they’ve (thus far) done a great job keeping the fatalities low compared to Italy and other parts of Europe."
"I repost""HiSome scientists say that if Greece the following week has the same rise as till today, it can be clean by the end of April.Of course, nobody knows if that happens or not.Same scientists say that many of the small European countries which take very quickly the right meassures, can be clean also by the end of April!""When they say end of April is not set on stone, can be earlier (hahaha) or later.Personally I don't find any reason the borders to be closed between countries that are clean from the virus."
"You are, my dear Dimitris, a very romantic man. lol"
"Clean is a country that has zero new cases for let's say 20 days. At least this is what i would call so. And you believe that this can happen towards next month..What i believe is during that period more and more countries will close their borders.Edited: 10:13 am, March 29, 2020 "
"Greece will / should be very careful to open its borders to any country (for the benefit of its citizens and the tourism industry), whether clean or not, and I imagine there will have to be a period of significant consolidation before that would even be considered, End of April is now only 32 days away. Really ?"
My heart would love to believe that my 9th visit since 2011 to Western Crete planned for mid June will go ahead (paid for in full).But my head is telling me to be realistic.I'm currently looking at the exact same holiday for 2021 and wondering whether to postpone my plans for a full year.
Snowballs and Hell come to mind...
"“ clean by the end of April”Wouldn’t that be wonderful :-) but I really can’t see that happening.....our government are now hinting that this is going to go on for six months. We are looking forward to returning to Crete in 2021, because I really can’t see us returning until then."
"""our government are now hinting that this is going to go on for six months.""Well, no, what they said was we may start returning to some sort of normality in six months time.Speaking at the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Dr Jenny Harries added: ""This is not to say we would be in complete lockdown for six months.""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52084517"
yes we are not going to be clear of it for months so unlikely to be travelling to other countries for some time
"Deborah R. And I didn't say it was, did I?I agree wholeheartedly with you DelboyAylesbury."
"This virus has just arrived and won't go into hiding for some time to come, we will be very lucky to travel freely in 2021."
"""if Greece the following week has the same rise as till today, it can be clean by the end of April.""Even if that was the case, thanks to the very quick reaction of the Greek government, they won't be as foolish as opening the country for tourism until a good deal later.I am a natural optimist and believe we MIGHT have a low key tourist season in the autumn, mainly with Crete regulars."
"You want people to give correct information, I was merely providing it. :)"
"“There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true."" Kierkegaard"
">I am a natural optimist and believe we MIGHT have a low key tourist season in the autumn, mainly with Crete regulars.<Not me, I'm afraid: I fully expect still to be in self-isolation in September/October. If I'm lucky.There is an article in the Guardian this morning. The writer is a professor at the Centre for Microbes, Development and Health at the Institute Pasteur in Shanghai: he reviews the draconian measures the Chinese government quickly put in place, which have succeeded in getting the virus under control for the moment, and points out that China has had a few advantages over other countries in dealing with the outbreak, resulting from its social and political system.I've extracted a couple of paragraphs. He says:""Everything now could be, to a degree, harder in the west. It looks very much as if lockdowns will, on average, need to be longer and stricter than in China – with freedoms regained over a longer period. The numbers of cases in the population have been higher on the date at which lockdowns were imposed. Once the numbers of cases in the community are down to manageable levels, technological solutions – such as antibody tests and contact tracing – might do some of the job of the army of busybodies here. But until that point, mass social distancing will remain necessary.In my own opinion, the costs of suppressing the outbreak are absolutely worth it. What many people on the right in the west, including Donald Trump, have failed to appreciate is that in economic terms, harbouring coronavirus is unfeasible. Until a country has shown that it has brought transmission under control, normal economic life cannot resume. Tourists will not visit and international travel will not be permissible – meaning that, until they get coronavirus under control within their own borders, countries will not be able to again join the world community of freely trading nations. That community today seems to consist of China alone.""But the entire piece is worth reading: here is a link.https:/…lockdown-china-coronavirus-outbreakEdited: 2:38 am, March 30, 2020 "
"People might also be interested to read this piece i picked up on the other day which concerns the Spanish Flu outbreak early last century and how different cities in America felt its effects,and also how the premature lifting of the lockdowns contributed to a further spike in cases.https:/…"
"Many thanks, Scaffolder, for giving us the link to this interesting National Geographic article.It draws the comparison between the 1918 pandemic and our current one very clearly. Then, social distancing proved the answer to bringing the virus under control, but it took two years: the outbreak lasted until 1920. One difference between the two pandemics is especially relevant to our forum: 100 years ago international travel didn't exist. Another is surely that the global population was much smaller, so the challenge today may be considerably greater.Edited: 3:46 am, March 30, 2020 "
Thanks scaffolder it explains to people why the UK is trying to adopt a computer model to avoid that spike in the graph
"And in today's news, no Easyjet flights...https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52084003"
"It is a very harrowing and worrying read,and hopefully the current Pandemic does not reach those sort of fatalities.But as this is a travel based forum i hope that people that do take the time to read it will have a better understanding of the essential need to curtail any form of travel and that this might well go on for a considerable amount of time before it is brought under control.The statistics clearly show that those places that did lift the lockdown early did have a secondary outbreak of fatalities in quite large numbers in some cases.And as much as i hope we all get the opportunity to again enjoy our travels, in reality this might not happen in the near future if we want to conquer this current tragic situation."
"I am in Crete & can tell you the virus is just at the start, yesterday Greece's death toll sadly grew by double figures for the first time. It will be several weeks before this growth slows, then more until it stops. We have to all pray & hope that the trajectory does not go so fast as other countries like Spain & Italy. But simply, this will not be over soon.Here, we are hoping that the Government will very soon delay lifting any bans until well after Easter, or the growth of cases on the islands will not be managable. It makes me sad if people are putting their business desires over human lives by 'advertising' it will be fine soon :("

I think most are being realistic.W/hat we need soon is some form of antiviral to treat this virus. If we are lucky they will identify an existing drug that is already approved that helps and therefore only needs approving for this virus.Any new drug or vaccine will need thorough testing and therefore will not be available for general use for quite some time. Easily a year.Lets continue to hope the lockdowns work. We also need this virus not to spread in countries it has not yet reached.
"Luckily most Cretans I know of ARE taking this seriously. Cretan people are very dramatic & luckily their drama is frightening most citizens to stay home, to do what is required & therefore to minimise spread. I do hope that their impatience can be curtailed for several months longer."
"Thanks scaffolder a very interesting read .I am hopefully looking forward to Autumn 2021, I am not pessimistic but realistic and can't see anyone from the UK travelling abroad for months, quite rightly too.I must also add a welcome back to MG Surrey just wish it was under better circumstances."
Thank you comet27 and margie54Northants....sad times indeed :-(
"Yes welcome back, you have been missed."
"Hi allEvery day at 18:00 we have an update on covid19 on Greek State Television.I will try to give you a brief summary of today's update.Scientists have a cautious optimism when they compare the increase in the incidents in Greece, to those who die as well as those who end up recovering.We may be on the peak, but we'll know for sure in the next few days. Quarantine will certainly continue after Easter, and the end of lockdown may begin in May gradually, if the situation doesn't change dramatically and if we continue to maintain the measures with great respect.Greek Infectious Diseases Team in collaboration with groups from abroad has developed a Rapid Test for covid19.The idea is that once Greece is clear of covid19 and that within a reasonable period of time other countries will start to do well, Greece will open its borders to those countries.All visitors to the country for whatever reason they come, they will do the rapid test and those who are negative will pass through the country and those who are positive will return to the country where they came from.When asked about the likelihood of someone presenting symptoms later, they said that in this case we will do what we do with ordinary patients, like in previous years with flu. It is impossible for any country to have its borders closed for ever and that the first wave is the most dangerous in all epidemics or pandemics.At the moment, this is the good scenario and we hope in the meantime to find some really active medicine that will make it even more feasible.In the main time, we stay in our homes for ourselves and to protect those we love!PS.In my opinion after a while we must learn to live with the covid19 like the flu or the HIV etc"
"How can you compare an airborne virus like flu or a coronavirus (including SARS-CoV-2, i.e. this virus) and HIV!!?!? I hope Greece is keeping this under control because we all know what's happening elsewhere.The only 'rapid' test for COVID-19 so far is to see if you have had it. There is no rapid test to see if you currently have it."
I live in Crete (Chania). All of our hotels are closed until 1 May. Most of our restaurants are as well.
"Hi KandiceNichols1978 I suppose the Kipos cafe is closed ????Edited: 9:55 pm, March 31, 2020 "
"#432 - I suspect the Greek govt is 'sugar coating' the likely scenario, and making every effort to spread some optimism among the Greek population. I understand why they would be doing that, but realism suggests otherwise . Greece, and Crete in particular, 'is not an island' and will not be able to act independently. This is a global issue unfortunately. Any opening of borders will have to be a very gradual process, and I doubt that will be within weeks. And comparing covid 19 to flu is frankly nonsense, sorry - that really does damage the credibility of any future Greek action plan."

We're booked to go to Crete in June 16 what are the chances
MichilleThink June will be out of the question.August perhaps but that's dependant on what's happening in your own country as well as Greece. Greece might not want to let you in.
">>And comparing covid 19 to flu is frankly nonsense, sorry <<In history, flu was as serious and deadly as Covid19 is now. It's only after a vaccin was developped that flu became more controlable.Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the flu kills 290,000 to 650,000 people per year."
"#442 - as we say in England you are comparing apples and pears ie. flu is more controllable and has a vaccine, covid 19 as yet is not and there is no vaccine available. Any suggestion that the two diseases are comparable is astonishing and in denial about the potential seriousness. Don't downplay the effects. It's not going anywhere quickly."
We are due to go 2nd June and totally believe it will not happen.
">>And comparing covid 19 to flu is frankly nonsense, sorry <<That is why thousands of beds and respirators are being prepared ready to tackle it. Hospital staff are dying trying to save patients. I can't remember this happening for flu in recent years. This is more deadly in passing it on to the next person."

But then the Greek autorities were much more quicker to react and doing the right things. Seems they are not morons like Bojo and Trump who were first laughing with everything. In the meantime the death toll in the UK and the US is respectively 7 and 3 times higher per 1M people compared to Greece.I wouldn't be surprised if people from the US and certainly the UK will be with the last that will be allowed entry to Greece again when all this is over.Edited: 3:51 pm, April 01, 2020 "
"Some toughening of measures within Greece today, such as further transport restrictions - eg 1 passenger in a taxi (2 if going to a hospital appointment), very restricted bus, coach use & tour buses & open-top buses allowed to be taken off road for the next 3 months.All swimming banned for at least 2 months.& a senior Government official in Heraklion says Crete's hotels unlikely to be open before end June & stated that he believes many hotels will not be open this year.Current 'Stay Home' movement rules are expected to be further enforced by the weekend, with either time restrictions given or a maximum of 2 permissions to leave home for essential reasons."

They all I think have an H and N number. To say 'flu' is naive at best.Let's face it and the world will be a very different place when this is over. And we are months away (who knows how many) from it being over. If most live a simple life then I am sure we can get through this and governments need to help. Even British Airways are likely to suspend 36,000 staff soon. These are unprecedented times. We should all remain positive and optimistic but also REALISTIC. Some are not REALISTIC at the moment with postings on TA."

"HiI don't like to accuse anyone unless they are going for it and deserve it!Some members here act like experts but they don't have the knowledge but their opinions are based on whatever they read on the blogs.Some others like to go against what is accepted by the majority, just for fun but I'm not one of them.As you can see few here write with their identity known and therefore are cautious and responsible of what they write. On the contrary, there are others who write with nicknames threfore they can write whatever. Of course, there are other members with nicknames that do an amazing job and give trustworthy information and I thank them for that.Edited: 5:30 am, April 02, 2020 "
I can only observe that it's always the same bunch that have snarky comments on those that have a different opinion on this Crete forum. I have had it with this particular forum where there are a few that feel so full of themselves.

"We are scheduled for June 3. Was going to spend a month with our kids in the islands (2 weeks in Crete). I don't want to go if we are going to be on a 14-day quarantine or the beaches/restaurants are closed. Waiting on AirBnB to allow me to cancel our home rentals penalty free.It is interesting to see on this blog everyone's opinions. Dimitri-Thanks for giving me a little hope that Greece will open up for the summer. I don't think the world can wait for the virus to be eliminated before putting people back to work.Edited: 10:55 am, April 02, 2020 "
"Hi Jon, I don't think you'll be going sadly, we're booked for the 12th, and I'm writing that holiday off tbh. I'm thankful that I've already had a trip abroad this year, and I'm looking forward very much to things getting back to normal."
"Would it be too soon to hope that my trip in September will still go ahead? Obviously no one knows how this virus will behave in hot weather, or if it will eventually morph into something similar to the flu once enough have been exposed to it. My trip at the moment is a bit of light to look forward to at the end of a long, bleak tunnel."
"My opinion Philip is that it's too early to know. I suspect we could be at this for some time. But, as I've said before, this situation is fluid and who knows where we will be in September."
"Kalispera allI am not sure when exactly the lockdown is finished but I think that will be earlier than many members think!Many say that is not possible coronavirus to disapear so we have to learn to live with it in a reasonable time.If we see how it spread in China and when it finished and comparing we have a measure! This coronavirus is the 8th in the world and we learnt to live with all 7 before that and we have to learn also with the covid19. I hope that the largest number of the people follow the correct steps to stay safe and not spread the virus to their community so the health systems can give help to the people who need it most.There are no countries who can have their borders closed for a long time, because they will get irreparable damage.The more developed an economy is, the more damage it suffers!From my experience many people believe that things will change much earlier and the Greek gov will take back the measures earlier, something I am not in position to know but the most think that by June things will be going back to normal slowly both in Greece and in the rest of the world.That's what I hope.PS.

"It's a very emotive time as we go through something that is totally alien and frightening to all of us.Some are worried about their already-booked holiday, some have deeper worries about their jobs and livelihoods - and even worse - about their health and the health of their families.We should respect those feelings.I'm sure my mid June holiday to Agia Marina will not go ahead.I'm seriously considering deferring it to the exact same thing for 2021.Below is the most sensible thing I've read on Tripadvisor about the situation regarding COVID-19:""We should all remain positive and optimistic but also REALISTIC.

HiI got much critic because I am optimist and not realist but actually I fell that I am both realistic and optimist.And it is very realistic too that if the season 2020 won't exist maybe the next season will be in 2025!In between probably we will have something like a season!
Dimitris - I reckon your previous post was removed because you referred to a SteveSitia post as 'lies' and proven not to be the case. We are all hoping for Crete to reopen when it is safe and risk free to everyone - Cretans and visitors. Good luck to you and your countryfolk.

"I imagine that Dimitris is extremely worried about his business, which is dependent on tourism; he faces a season with no livelihood, and is more emotional than usual and inclined to ""snap"" and fire off accusations that he probably wouldn't under less desperate circumstances.He isn't the only one on a short fuse these days: we're all worried sick about our health, some of us about our jobs and income, all of us about our loved ones, and about the future. So can we please leave it now, and stop fanning the fire? What's happening to all of us is far too serious and too devastating to waste time pointing fingers and scoring points."
"@ comet"" Why is there so little representation from Cretan people on this forum would they not be the ones who would benefit the most ??""I've been a member of TA for many years and always thought that the forums were for people travelling to places, asking for recommendations for restaurants, accommodation etc.As TA say on forums home:""Learn from your fellow travellers. Tap the Tripadvisor community to help get the most out of your next trip. ""That's certainly how I've always viewed the forums, dipping in and out of various boards all over the world, depending on what holidays we had booked/were considering booking.I do appreciate that there are many local people who give invaluable advice to travellers.But I'm not sure what you mean by Cretan people would benefit the most.Surely Cretan people are getting information regarding COVID-19 and their local situation with from their own Government.I don't think - as a UK citizen - that I would benefit the most from reading the UK TA board.Or the board for my nearest city.I would expect that most people posting on that board would be hopeful travellers who have trips booked to the UK and are wanting to know what it's like on the ground here in the UK.I'm finding the information - when it is verified - about what is happening in Greece very informative and I thank local people for taking the time to post, whether on this thread or the other Greek boards I read on a regular basis.I think it's sad that people are falling out and arguing over something we can't control.But if they choose to walk away then that's their choice."
Great post Alabastron.
"Alabastron the last thing I worry is my buissness!!!At first I worry for my country Greece and Crete secondly for the people around the world they get sick and their life is in danger, thirdly about the Greek economy after 10 years crisis this new one it hides far more risks than the previous one.Forth for my family, and all people are very close to me and only then about my small company!I don't think I fire off accusations and If I did please mark the number of my post to I reread carefully as it is not my intention to accuse!"

"Jet2 confirm all flights & holidays cancelled until at least 17th June.They talk about a small take-up of transferred bookings for late summer, in the hope the latter part of season will exist, with most people, as you'd expect, changing to 2021. They say there will be some very reduced prices for late summer (assuming they can operate, of course) as people will be reluctant to risk travelling, & many may still be in isolation.https://hania.news/2020/04/04/jet2holidays-Αναβολή-των-πακέτων-διακοπών-έως-τι/?fbclid=IwAR06EYhrmT3aFT5jyGwySCC-L2qpDpCQd0YrR54cuKXsEujJ2iJhKsI61sc"

"Not unexpected but strangely, nothing about this on the Jet2 or Jet2holidays websites & if you try a ""dummy booking"" on the holidays website, it is still offering holidays to Crete, departing Belfast on 25th May. They really should be keeping their website info more up to date with current events."
Sorry I don't understand how to view this information and I can't find it anywhere on line.

Thanks for the help.
"This is a foreign news report (isn’t it?).

"I agree with 123twinkletoes. I suspect as well, that they might be waiting to see what happens over the next couple of weeks. June is still a couple of months off and I imagine many businesses will be edging their bets.The situation is constantly changing, and businesses have to adapt to that and have contingency plans in place for if this goes on for a long time."

"Jet2 haven’t dealt with holidays for May yet (as far as I know), let alone to mid June. What the government has to say in the coming weeks will be paramount. Can’t see Jet2 making any swingeing decisions before then."

"HiToday at 18:00 in covid19 daily update Mr. Tsiodras the head of the medical committee against the covid19 together with two ministers of the Greek gov. explained thatthere is a stabilization in the increase of the cases and this allows us to assume that we have passed in a new phase: the beginning of the peak, already.The existing measures are being extended until April 27 and if we continue to keep the measures with reverence - as until now, by the end of this period, they will start announcing the counter-escalation measures.They, once again, asked us to reduce as much as possible our exits and contacts and explicitly forbade the travels of the population to the villages and islands during the Easter period."

"I wouldn't bet on being able to travel to Crete, or indeed anywhere else in Greece, this year. This is a pandemic, which in these days of globalism means that it is a world-wide catastrophe; and that means that no government that has managed to get covid-19 under control can risk importing it from countries that haven't.One of the Athens DEs posted this today on the Athens forum:""A few thousand imported virus cases is the last thing we’ll need, especially on the islands - and my guess will be that flights from highly infected countries such as USA and UK will be banned indefinitely.""I think this is probably correct. Alas! I did hope to be able to get back to Crete after five years of being unable to travel, but I don't think it looks likely - not this year, at any rate, and perhaps not in my lifetime."
"Alabastron I do hope that you can travel next year.For now traveling is only a dream for everybody.. I think after a few months, someone could travel only after antibodies testing."
"Alabastron - excellent and considered post. Some on here will accuse you of being defeatist with a pessimistic view. I personally regard it as realism.Whilst optimism and hope is no bad thing on occasions, when the hopes are crushed it can be disheartening. There was a poster on here only a few days ago suggesting the lock down would be eased at the end of April, now suggesting the end of May. I won't be holding my breath on that one.I consider this very unlikely. As we say, pie in the sky.I myself have a holiday booked late June, and into July. It would take something miraculous for the borders to be open, and in all fairness I'm not sure I would wish to risk transferring any infection on to this wonderful island.2021 is my target. Anything else looks very premature to me. Batten down the hatches everyone and stay safe."
"Hi allI am not a magician when this crisis will end but you should know that when the borders are open and Greece says you can come for holidays in our country, those who want will come and the rest will stay at their country.I don't think anyone can force somebody on holidays!Is not that right ?"
"Of course D, let's hope common sense prevails when those decisions are made."
"Thanks Michael. I don't think I'm either an optimist or a pessimist, though I've been accused of being both, (depending on who is doing the accusing, of course). In the present situation, I'm both. I'm optimistic about Greece being able to get covid-19 under control because the government acted quickly to avoid infection arriving from else where by shutting down the tourist industry. I'm pessimistic about the virus being brought under control globally until every country is clear of it, because it is a global infection, easily transported: that's what pandemic means. It's the old saying writ large: a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.Speaking of links, here's one to an interesting TED talk by a global health consultant, which impressed me as making perfect sense.https:/…Elena, thank you too. I'd give a great deal to be able to travel to Crete next year. Meanwhile I'm enjoying the quiet, empty skies above London, and the cleaner air."

Good morning Some news from Britain https:/…https:/…
"D - I was desperately hoping for something tangible in the above links.You call the articles news. Sadly, they are not.The author is repeating what the majority of posters on here are continually saying - we are SO missing Crete / Greece, and it may well be our first destination when this monster has been tamed."
And both articles are written by the same person - who is simply saying that Greece is number 1 on his bucket list when this is over.Not not really 'news' as such - just column filler.
"All countries have different strategies of tackling this virus and there is at present no vaccine, so no cure.It is spread by person contact or articles touch with it on. Social distancing reduces it as the virus struggles to find its next victim. It was probably best for Greece to do a lock down in non tourist times and keep the number of deaths down. However, you can not keep a lock down for ever and once eased the virus will quickly find more people to pass it on. It is said that the virus would need 60% of the population to be immune from it for it to loose its grip. We are all on different paths and weeks apart in this scenario What the outcome for us all remains to been seen at the end of this terrible year. So all do you best to avoid one another until this cure can be foundAll try and stay safeEdited: 4:41 am, April 05, 2020 "
The Telegraph: Greece First on Travel List After Covid-19 CrisisPosted On 03 Apr 2020The first country I'll visit after coronavirus? There's no contest2 April 2020
we all like Greece on here Dimitri that is why we write on here. But at present it is not going to happen
HiWhy do you think it is necessary to announce what you will do!Who cares what you do?It is your personal decision and obviously the best for you but really of no general interest!
if you are are referring to me Dimitri it is not my decision it is our Government and our insurance.I am fully expecting my trip to be cancelled in June by my tour operator

">It is said that the virus would need 60% of the population to be immune from it for it to loose its grip.<Herd immunity is a dubious concept in the present circumstances. What is not yet known is whether contracting and recovering from the virus confers immunity, and if it does, for how long?In any case, herd immunity to a disease usually refers to a population in which 60%-70% of people have been *vaccinated* against that disease, not deliberately exposed to a disease that is known to be potentially fatal! The idea, floated in March as a strategy by the UK government, that the population should be exposed to the virus so that 60% of us could contract it and that that this would bring about herd immunity, overlooked the fact that significant numbers of people would die from it. It was scandalous, and thankfully quickly discredited.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/1…It looks as though this virus is not going away until there is a vaccine and until most of the world's population has been vaccinated. That is going to take some time. And there are more viruses to come. The tragedy is that MERS and SARS, both corona viruses, weren't taken sufficiently seriously at the time: had they been, there would probably be a vaccine by now. They weren't taken seriously by the rich nations of the northern hemisphere presumably because they affected only ""faraway countries of which we know little"".Edited: 5:25 am, April 05, 2020 "
Hi Alabastion The point was that 60% of a population needs to be immune for the virus for it to struggle and whilst it has more it will continue. A vaccine would achieve that
"Yes, I know what you meant, Delboy. :o) My post was intended to bring a touch of realism into the discussion, and I used your comment as an entry point. It wasn't meant as disagreement with you, and I'm sorry if it seemed so.Edited: 5:37 am, April 05, 2020 "
">>The tragedy is that MERS and SARS, both corona viruses, weren't taken sufficiently seriously at the time: had they been, there would probably be a vaccine by now. <<FYI: the Belgian company Jannsen Pharmaceutica (part of Johnson&Johnson) has developed a SARS vaccine some years ago. On that base, as SARS is a kind of 'little' brother of COVID-19, they are now working on a COVID vaccine. https://www.jnj.com/coronavirus"

Michael I already answered.. This fine doesn't exist at last.They rescinded immediately. It was a terrible mistake of the policeman( human being)So you only know part and not the whole story...
"HiToday at 18:00 in covid19 daily updateToday the briefing was presented by a representative of the Ministry of Health and from tomorrow it will again be made by Mr. Tsiodras and other members of the committee responsible for the covid 19.The situation has not changed since yesterday, we have performed 25.000 molecular tests and we have 62 new cases confirmed and all together 1735 cases, 93 ICU intubated and 73 deaths.For those who have not been informed, after a few days the quarantine was imposed, the government decided that the offenders who will be outside for no reason (after making very specific the cases where the community can go out) will be fined 150 euros.About 20.048 fines of 150euro have been imposed, as well as some larger ones in businesses that are open when they should be closed.Anyone who believes that they have been mistakenly fined by the authorities, they may file an objection to the District Police Commander within three days, either electronically or by fax.The police gave a fine by mitstake to homelees man but after while it was deleted.With this opportunity the gov looks to to find places ( hotels or institutions) for the homeless to stay for this period.Edited: 12:18 pm, April 05, 2020 "
It's not just in Crete that police have handed out fines to the homeless. Also in Thessalonikihttps:/…& also in France 2+ weeks agohttps://www.euronews.com/2020/03/20/coronavi…
Some of the photos coming out of the UK today are shocking with so many completely ignoring the laws to such an extent that excersing may now be banned. It's about time the UK police took a firmer stance and if mistakes are made in terms of the homeless then that can be rectified.
"Michael, do you need to answer to your question for third time?They realised the mistake and the fine was Deleted!You posted the same question twice in two threads. Check again if that was the problem, the double posting! And not some kind of policeEdited: 1:06 pm, April 05, 2020 "
"Totally agree with you Jock regarding the firmer stance required by the U.K. Police,i also firmly believe that we have been far too lax on people returning to the UK. and are now unfortunately paying a heavy price in the number of deaths.Hopefully Greece's tougher earlier stance limits the spread."
"660,000 poeple in Crete and only 2 locals posting on TA How weird ."
"Did you read Elena's post explaining why, comet? It isn't in the least wierd."

JeanCrete thank you for your very knowledgeable answer. We were suppose to be staying at the Kydon Hotel in 2 weeks time and I was so looking forward to coffee at the Kipos cafe a souvlaki from Θraka a walk around the old port seeing my aunty who lives near the δικαστήρια and cousin that live in Stalos. BTW I stand to be corrected but the Kydon hotel has the best bougatsa I have ever tasted LOL
"HiThe committee of Greek health ministry reported that the 15% of serious incidents by covid19 they get different kinds of brain damages.The people over 50 or so must be very careful because if they get this kind damages the recovery is very difficult.Edited: 10:18 am, April 06, 2020 "
"Kalimera, Comet!Yiassas gave a good point... You have a lot of friends in Crete, and relatives, people that lived abroad, and the majority of them as you say speak English!Well why don't you invite them, to be members of the forum? And why they didn't thought by themselves?Have they a TA profile?Have they ever read a post here?If they have the time, patience, knowledge, they should be here... Really!!! I am a very patient person, thats why I keep answering to you again and again. It's the third time I answer your question. I prefer the Comet with the sense of humour... Will you be happier if these two cretans disappear?Edited: 3:19 am, April 06, 2020 "
"That sounds like it would have been a good trip, Comet. If the bougatsa at the Kydon is that good, I reckon they'll be buying it at Bougatsa Iordannis, just round the corner. the very best.Keep your trip in your mind until you can come, whenever that will be."

Back on topicThe comitee against covid19 of Greek health ministry announced that the 15% of the serious incidents get brain damages.They suggest to the people over 50 years old or so to be very careful as the the recovery of this brain damages is much more difficult.

"DimitrisThis alleged 'brain damage' was reported in UK media (The Mirror, Independent, Daily Mail) 2 or 3 days ago.it appears to be a woman from Detroit who 'may have developed rare brain disease as a result of coronavirus' and a 'Florida patient in his 70s lost the ability to speak at least temporarily, The New York Times reported.'Cases have been reported in China and Italy.In all the articles I've read, there are lots of 'perhaps' and 'might' and 'may' and 'maybe' sprinkled through the article - as in we don't know - so I would doubt that anyone would have announced that 15% of the serious incidents get brain damages.As in ""it's a fact that this is the case"".I feel your post is scare-mongering unless you have valid evidence to back it up."
