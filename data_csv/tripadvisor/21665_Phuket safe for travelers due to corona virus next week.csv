Is phuket safe for travelers due to corona virus next week
"Yeah, come on over it'll be great. I'll put some Coronas on ice for you. Mmmm, maybe Tigers would be better. Hang on that doesn't sound right either."
Is corona virus going on holiday in Phuket next week?
"Good grief, Praveen. Are you serious? What on earth makes you think that other travellers (just like you) would be able to answer such a question.You really do need to take some responsibility and make your own decisions as we all do.Edited: 6:49 am, January 30, 2020 "
"PraveenWe are not doctors, epidemiologist or WHO, can't advise you on this aspect. May be Lord Ganesh might be able to help"
"I just returned 3 days ago. I am displaying no fever no sore throat no cough no runny nose but feeling very tired since i came. I went to my local gp also called our public health line, both said nothing to worry about as i don't have common symptoms. But i suggest any one not to go thailand at this stage as we have no clear idea how this virus is spreading. I have locked my self in room and awaiting atleast 10 days to pass and see.Bearing in mind some people don't show any symptoms but can be carrier and pass to others. Wish me luck guys. Regards"
Good luck. I hope you had the foresight to keep some food in the room and that you have en suite facilities.
"The only thing wrong with you is jet lag, 13 hour flight, 7 hour time difference, we’ve been many time and it takes more than a week to lose that tiredness, if you’re still worried go to see your doctor and remember this, if you have got the Coronavirus you are the only one in the world to had got it as a tourist from Thailand, that’s one in 500 million lol"
I have a 1 y.r. Skipping Bangkok and Phuket for this year for sure. Staying in Khao Lak!
"Thank goodness you’ve taken all those precautions, Xayn. People are dropping like flies in the streets."
"I was in Bangkok last week and I'm still alive. I'm flying to HCMC this afternoon, I hope I survive :) lolPeople who are panicking need to cancel their trips to stop themselves worrying to death about it"
"jaynewcastle11, I know right?? the media is to be blame too. They caused panic by reporting inaccurate news. My sister told me, one of her foreign student too scared to return to Kuala Lumpur due to coronavirus because he saw in the news in his country. They probably got mixed up Malaysia and China. Failed their Geography. LOL"
We are In the same boat as you. We are supposed to leave on March 3rd and now we don’t want to go. Our travel insurance won’t cover it because it’s deemed that we are changing our mind. Our accommodation is non refundable and flight changes cost more than our original booking. We are trying to prevent our young family from catching this horrible virus. At least we are lucky in a sense that we have a choice not to travel be it at a cost.
How much to change name on accommodation & are they pet friendly......where they at ???555
"Your departure date is over a month away, Linda. A lot is bound to change during that time and you will have a clearer idea as to whether or not it will be safe and sensible to proceed."
"Looks like Linds needs to worry about catching the virus at home, in Australia."
@ctm7944 let’s hope not!
We are on same boat on 12 Feb my flight is booked I m also confused
"Confused.......you've never flown before ???It's easy, don't worry, just get there early."
No issues with that I m confused or fear inside for Corona virus still not decided what to do traveling with my husband and daughter
The problem is the Chinese government is not allowing the truth to be told and anyone who speaks publicly in their country is arrested and severely punished. We are not dealing with an open and honest government. They manipulate the truth to benefit themselves. We don’t truly know the extent of infections or deaths. It’s been widely reported that many countries in Asia don’t have the facilities to test accurately for this virus. Do we really know how bad it is?? Sorry to say but I don’t trust their dictatorship ways.
"Hi SumanIf you are confused and fearful, the most sensible thing to do is to cancel your trip. Even though statistically it would be almost impossible for you or your family to be infected, the fact that you are so worried would spoil your holiday."
I m confused but I already pay for flights and hotel so let's be positive till 12feb may be some antidote will be there
"Vaccination wont be around until the middle of the year is what the smart money is sayingThey need to understand the virus first, then sort out what will be effective against it for us humans, then conduct clinical trials to make sure it wont do more harm than good, like the Dengue Fever vaccination has done concerning children last yearFancy being a guinea pig I have heard it pays a reasonable amount of folding materialHappy Travels"
"Of course I understand that losing the price of flights and accommodation is not confusing, but distressing. Therefore you will need to weigh up what is the most important to you. Losing the money or being worried every step of the way of your trip. Only you can make that decision."
have you cancelled your trip
"# 26 ... on understanding the virus .... 555Saw this news-blip....got a good chuckle, not sure why, but ' Welcome to Thailand ' came to mind, with so much soap / disinfectant, and hot water in the rest rooms here. With that also, enjoy your street food.https:/….XjkCMWgzbIU"
Soap and disinfectant needs to be available in toilets as well as rest rooms (whatever their purpose). Obviously soap would almost always be available in bathrooms.
"I rarely see soap available, except at the malls.........another reason I enjoy the food courts."
"@POST 29Yes understanding the virus is of paramount importance my man if its to be defeated, which I am sure it will be eventuallySome peoples cleanliness and habits leave a bit to be desired, I prefer not to dwell too much on that thanksHappy Travels"

"If here before and not concerned about the common flu, dengue, hep A, malaria, typhoid, measles, chicken pox, TB & JE, then why would you worry about wuhan flu.....as least of your worries."
"This got me curious, as things do, and I'm bored..........they really hide the numbers, and hard to get info.Corona Virus .. in country 2 ??? TTL cases 25 deaths 0Diseases for 2019 ... not full year, or year I could find info onDengue Fever ...... ......In an update on the dengue fever situation in Thailand this year, health officials now report 102,510 cases through Oct. 15, 2019 including ...... 110 deaths and 126 dengue-related fatalities in 2018Cases have been reported from all 77 provinces.Chikungunya............In addition, Thai health authorities reported an additional 256 chikungunya cases in the past week, bringing the total cases to 8,360 from 53 provinces.Malaria........In 2017 there were 11,440 confirmed cases of malaria in Thailand with 11 reported fatalities.Japanese Encephalitis..........Thailand Endemic countrywide; seasonal epidemics in the northern provincesYear-round with peak season from May to October, especially in the northHighest rates of human disease reported from the Chiang Mai Valley;several cases reported recently in travelers who visited resort orcoastal areas of southern Thailand.Hepatitis A................Simply too many, and most mild, and not admitted for it. So numbers would only touch on it.TB ... a bit of a surprise here......In Thailand, according to the WHO's estimate, the ratio was 156:100,000 last year. The number of new patients and those who are drug resistant is expected to be over 100,000 a year.Actually most better than I expected. Suspect Malaria a bit higher than others. Uneducated guess. And hard to tell as a long term issue, so omitted. Same with measles & chicken pox, as most vaccinated against.Edited: 5:54 am, February 05, 2020 "
Did you cancel your trip or r u there how's it going reply please
"I canceled ours, for me the hype all over the news about this virus scared me too much. I also read some countries including Thailand have kept their borders open for all passengers arriving to and from mainland China so you would think they too will see an increase in cases soon."
"Linds06, whether people agree or disagree with you decision more power to you for deciding for yourself. I can’t understand people (majority Indians) who want strangers on a Travel Forum to decide for them."
"Singapore's health ministry confirmed four more coronavirus cases, including a six-month-old baby. Both parents of the infant, a Singapore citizen, have also been infected, the ministry said. On Tuesday, Singapore reported its first cases of citizens and residents who had contracted the virus without recent travel to China, where the outbreak first surfaced in late December. - Reuters"
"People just want the opinions of others to justify their own decision, regardless of whether they agree with them or not. At the end of the day the final choice is yours to be made."
"Not me, you're again off topic!"
Same is happening with us our flight is on 14th Feb to Phuket and reading all that we are so worried
"Hi IsabellaYou are quite right when you indicate that it’s good for people to be able to share their feelings on the forum. However, it most certainly is NOT right when people are expecting others, strangers at that, to make important decisions for them, which is what we are seeing here."
Right wouldn’t it be super sucky if they threw a quarantine up while you were there or stopped flights. It has been said that many people flee to neighboring countries or cities to avoid quarantine. The flu has killed more people than this however if you’re pregnant with the flu and you have a baby they won’t have it to but if you have the coronavirus they’ll be born with the coronavirus We drink bottle water and go to Whole Foods our food we buy at the market goes through vigorous inspections and restaurants and food trucks have to answer to the Food and Safety also you can’t step outside and see twenty stray dogs with no idea who’s damn dog is this. Therefore my immunity and resistance won’t be anywhere as near as prepared for this strain of coronavirus like theirs would be and they are still getting sickWho knows how well or if at all the hotel sanitized the room after the last person or if the restaurant is cleaning the utensils and not just giving everything a dirty rag wipe downIf I were to get sick or get my child sick with a virus that has killed people or made them suffer I’d pay my last dollar and the last dollar of anyone who would let me for a cure or even relief so whatever I lost in non refundable tickets is just take on the chin
https:/…
"We are due to go in 2 weeks as well and are just trying to keep informed of news reports etc and new cases before making a decision nearer the time. I don’t think people want to be told whether it’s safe or not to go, as we all have to decide that ourselves, however it’s nice to get other travellers opinions and to guage if most people are still going ahead or are cancelling. I am hoping we will still go but too early to make decision yet. I would like to know if generally tourists are still Out and about visiting attractions and enjoying holiday as normal? Are people generally (Europeans) only wearing masks in crowded places, airports etc or would we have to wear it all the time ? I refer to Europeans as experience from Vietnam shows Asians wear them most of the time all tear round regardless. Are the streets in Chiang Mai still full of tourists and the beaches in Phuket or is the place scarily quiet? It all helps in making decisions so anybody that is currently in Thailand I would value your input ....!"
"No one in Thailand has died from Corona virus yet, there have only been 25 cases mostwere Chinese who have gone back to China, a few Thais have caught it but recovered. Yes some Europeans are wearing masks but not all the time. To put it into perspective some nutter has just killed at least 17 people in a shopping centre in Korat, many more have been killed on the roads in the last 4 weeks. I think people are overreacting. I don’t know about Phuket or CM but there are plenty of tourists in areas I have been. How many people have died in the UK from flu this year?"
https://youtu.be/VZCVvpsaH_8This man is there right now. He did some morning grocery shipping and you can see the feel of the place
Thanks for your reply. I have just spoken to our travel agent who has told me only a few of their clients have cancelled and that once in Thailand and away from negative press reports we probably won’t notice much difference to usual except for lack of Chinese tour groups! Sensible hand washing and Anti bacterial wiping of things will be frequently done and fingers crossed we will be ok!
Are you going to phuket tomorrow??
We are coming on 21 st Feb yooo
"My husband and I are travelling on 24 feb to Thailand and we too have concerns, but after travelling to remote parts of Africa in the past and not contracting anything we’ve decided to go ahead with our holiday, you could just as easily become sick with Coronavirus in England but at end of day only you can decide."
"We are going next week. Spoke to our pharmacist and she said it wouldn’t stop her. As long as you are fit and healthy even if you did contract it , chances are symptoms wouldn’t be any different to the normal flu that many people with complications die of in this country every year already! Just be scrupulous with hand sanitizers and we have masks to wear in case we feel we should - eg Bangkok airport probably and anywhere particularly busy. I’m sure we will be fine! Go and enjoy your holiday !"
Hi IsabellaTo settle your mind it probably would be helpful for you to do some maths. Research the percentage of the population who have been confirmed as having the virus. Then work out the percentage of those people who have recovered and are continuing with their everyday lives. What you’ll be left with is a percentage possibility of catching the virus and not recovering. You’ll likely discover that you have a much greater chance of winning the lottery.
There have been reported a total of 34 cases in Thailand so far.I don't understand all the fuss about this virus.
"And how many of those 34 people have died, Dennis? How many people have died as a result of traffic accidents in the same time frame?"
"Travelkat you probably know that zero has died, and evey day thousands get injured in traffic in Thailand.People needs to get a grip and realise what should be the main concern of a holiday in Thailand.And yes Isabella it is a silly question."

"It’s not a silly question - that’s what this site is for - to ask for advice from fellow travellers. Don’t let the rude small minded people on here get to you ! As my mum used to say ‘if you haven’t got anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all’. Have a great holiday!"
"Isabella........Then catching the flu really shouldn't be anything new to you, and you 'should' be more informed than most, with this statement:""iv been in hospital 3 times with pneumonia and treated at home 6 times over the last 20 years""Surely your med pros have informed you how many die every year, or since sickly, did some kind of research on your own. That would be 1000's die of common flu / pneumonia. Don't need to be on social media, or do you live in a cave, as all over the MSM, and all of 4 people have died outside of China. I don't even watch any TV, BUT, how do you miss not reading the news occasionally.WOW....4 people....Does that sound like a crisis to you ???Edited: 6:46 am, February 16, 2020 "

"Good GOD....don't turn the news on, 9 in the UK, out of 70 million people, no deaths, and if 4 people dying out of 6+ billion outside of china, upsets you. How do you leave the house.Talk about Karma, the UK / USA / NATO killed a million people the last decade or so with their fate wars.......your tax dollars supported. You better stay inside.Karma's out there...........just waiting."
Wauv #72 if you are that sensible you should probably never watch the news or read a paper.There are 34 reported cases in Thailand and 0 Zero on Phuket.If you use Google you would know in 5 minutes.And given your med history shouldn’t you listen to your doctors advise instead of using Tripadvisor full of people with bad karma.Anyway maybe a tropical country is not for you because you risk getting a flu when you return to your cold wet country.
Thanks for the label Isabella.I will not share what I think of you.But you should probably stay away from Thailand. To much can puts your health in fanger and ruin your holiday.I truly hope you find another safe country.
Honestly I think you will not be able to enjoy Thailand so wish you the best.
Did you visit Phuket and is it fine as I am planning next week
Did you finally cancel your plan to Phuket. I am booked next week and still undecided
It won’t change anything by you endlessly posting your question. It will still be up to you to make your own decision. It is clear that you don’t want to do that but nobody else will do that for you.
"I am arriving from Europe and bought the plane ticket mid January. In a week I am landing in Phuket. I understand there is great panic about the Wuhan flu. Nobody wants to get sick, especially not on vacation. Many Chinese aren't arriving in Phuket and cancelled their trips. The prices of hotels dropped significantly. I am going any way. There is a pandemic going on but reported about with fear, panic and prospect of potential hazard. I want to be a reasonable person but I don't want to be controlled by fear."
hi we are travelling on 18th March just trying to find out if everywhere is still open if excursions will continue don't want to go if it is deserted and I heard some hotels had shut I don't no how true any of this is thanks for any comments or advice
""" heard some hotels had shut I don't no how true any of this is ""Haven't heard, read or seen a true negative statement yet, concerning Thailand.All is normal, better than normal, if not a vendor, as less crowds,"
thank you
check this out before travelling anywhere https:/…
I just got back from Phuket after 12 days. There was little screening if none from flight coming from Russia like mine. There are very few Chinese in Patong where I was. Many Russians are traveling to vacation there with kids and even babies. Yes Phuket is not crowded with tourists.
Did you end up going? We're going in 3 weeks and not sure whether to cancel?
