"Does it go to triple digits,because I’d give the US 100 based on Barbados being a 3!"
"Sorry for the political comment - but after the latest news regarding the rationale of anything coming out of this US administration - why would you expect anything other than ""ludicrous"" the word used by DPM Freeland at her morning press conference. (Apparently Canada is a danger to the safety of the USA ? )Edited: 3:41 pm, August 07, 2020 "
I was just looking at the CDCs interactive map then saw this post. A quick look and it seems like everywhere is a danger. . Dont travel folks.. wish everyone everywhere could just sit tight.
Meant to post the link https:/…map-and-travel-notices.html
Canby exactly. It puts Barbados in the same category as countries with high positive counts. It's silly and does not make sense.
"Again I wish everyone would for the most part just hang tight.(especially from the US hotspots!) I simply don't believe or trust that those traveling, and heading out as tourists are as conciencous as they need to be. Absolutely some are but many are not. All you have to do is poke around TA's other forums and read the questions and comments and its obvious there are too many who will knowingly break or skirt around ""the rules"" or are just careless. Or simply just dont think covid is a big deal. So please unless you can be a good traveler...stay home."
"Canada is also a cat 3. With less than 100/day for a population of 14M(in our province)... what a joke. At least this may stop Americans from using our airports to get to countries that have banned or severely curtailed American entry to their country.Edited: 6:10 pm, August 07, 2020 "
"I am for anything that discourages Americans from traveling to Barbados at this time. America's travel advisory about Barbados is ludicrous, but if it serves to limit the number of Americans going to Barbados, I am thrilled with it. I am a Barbadian living in the U.S. The behavior of many Americans during this pandemic is so abominable and shocking that I am having great difficulty getting through each day here. Many Americans don't care about infecting each other, so they won't care about infecting Barbadians. It is best that they stay home until the virus is brought under control in the US. In the meantime, I have started planning my repatriation to Barbados."
"Good luck with the repatriation Bimfleur , I hope it doesn't take you too long to achieve."
""" Its better for everyone if Americans just stay home,"" particularly POTUS, who should be locked away!!"
