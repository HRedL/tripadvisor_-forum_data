"Not my idea of fun. I only want to go on holiday when things are 'properly' normal again which will only be when/if a vaccine is developed, proven in its efficacy and available worldwide. Until then the best holidays will be the ones here at home.Edited: 1:20 pm, May 03, 2020 "
"Hiya Clint, hope you and yours are keeping well and safe.That really isn't my idea of fun. We've decided not to rebook our Egypt trip after speaking to friends simply because it's not right to go and potentially stretch their overburdened medical services.Instead, we're looking at Athens or Istanbul as they have more medical infrastructure and will be opening to tourists in June. We wouldn't be bothered at all if my husband's burgeoning career didn't depend on his travel. I suspect when museums reopen they'll open on a similar basis to the way the Louvre operates it's special events. You have a time to arrive and if you arrive over 30mins before that time you are turned away. It will keep queues down and allow them to regulate visitors. Especially if they pen off the wings in such a way that you need to go in one direction through the museum. One way traffic would help with social distancing.Thankfully, immunity has been confirmed in South Korea which raises my hope of a vaccine. Maybe a light at the end of the tunnel. Until then I'll try and support the hard workers in tourism in as safe a way as possible.Keep safe and we everyone."
"To be honest, I am now thinking that I will not be able to have a foreign holiday this year at all. We have had two cancelled (Hurghada in March and Palma in May) and fully expect that our trip to Croatia in June will receive the same fate.Having said that, a holiday is meant to be a holiday, not a war of attrition and what you have outlined makes grim reading . I'm not sure I would personally want to spend good money to holiday under those conditions.They say Filey is nice in November."
"Hmmm sounds like a holiday with a difference, not much fun in sun.I won't be going until xmas to el gouna, but that won't happen if things haven't changed much, or theirs no vaccine. Will wait and see.First I've a trip to Turkey in September. Again, just have to see."
I can understand the rules but where are they getting the custom from and what is the point?Visitors will only be Egyptians but guess it's a start.Not my idea of normal just for the sake of returning to a hotel
"Clint - You begin with saying ... ""Hotels will open with 25% capacity to start with."" From what date?Would this be before borders re-open and thus, just, for Egyptian residents? As there may not be any international flights? Will all flights, when there are any, keep passengers 2 metres apart in Cabins?How will they allocate spaces for each individual to swim in, in the Pool ... or will they be closed.Will attractions re-open in line with Hotels. All Bars, Restaurants, Cafes, Supermarkets, Malls, Museums etc ... and Diving clubs, Luxor Trips etc...Will their be small shuttle bus transfers or will solo travellers be expected to take a saloon car Taxi?Will families, who have been keeping close together in their homes, be expected to abide by ""social distancing"" in Lounges.Will women who may feel vulnerable, and thus travel in pairs, have to keep 2 metres apart from the moment they set foot in Hurghada?Will you, please, stay two metres away from my Hotel when I visit ... (only joking.)CheersAnthony K"
"“Will all flights, when there are any, keep passengers 2 metres apart in Cabins?“Only if the airline restricts the number of passengers per flight to a number that is incompatible with making a profit. The company would then have to (1) raise the ticket price to a level unaffordable by most ordinary holidaymakers or (2) ask the Government to subsidise unprofitable holiday flights. As the second is unlikely, the airline would soon (1) abandon such flights or (2) go bust and the question is academic.Edited: 10:28 pm, May 03, 2020 "
"BBeckettExactly. That is why I posed the question. Where EasyJet, for example, are taking future bookings and they are allocating the seats, they are trying to keep centre seats, of three, empty.Non-charter flights, with designated, expensive, First-Class areas, almost like cabins themselves, can have Economy half-empty if they have already filled their 1st Class and thus made their profit.If Airlines were given a dispensation, and allowed to pack us in like sardines, once again, then first, I think less people would travel and secondly the Airlines would have to upgrade their Air-conditioning systems.Anthony K"
"ClintAs I have discovered on numerous occasions, having been in Muslim countries during Ramadan, the final date can fluctuate dependent on the movement of the sun and moon and dawn times and dusk times. Can you not just answer a simple question ... you are the OP.Also ""After Ramadan,"" as it is very early this year, you could mean immediately after, several days after, a week or more after or who knows ... as long as it is after.Anthony K"
"The forum was, without doubt a noticeably more pleasant and enjoyable place for a good number of weeks right up to the start of May. Something then changed. I wonder what it might have been?#8 Yes of course the pools will be closed.Edited: 3:58 am, May 04, 2020 "
…ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/368556/Egypt/…
"“... the final date can fluctuate dependent on the movement of the sun and moon and dawn times and dusk times...”The beginning and end of Ramadan depend on the sightings of the new moon. It’s a lunar calendar, not a solar or lunisolar one."
"Thank-you Catherine. That spells out most things quite clearly.As I have noted before any loosening of restrictions, in Hurghada, will mean little to most of us until Egypt reopens it's borders to International flights.Even then, if outbound and return flights were possible, it would be no fun to take a fortnight's vacation, only to return home to a fortnights quarantine.CheersAnthony KPS - I note, as expected, the closing of Hotel Pools ... let's hope the Red Sea is warm enough and welcoming when we can visit."
"“...they are trying to keep centre seats, of three, empty.“A meaningless PR gesture that, if they’re serious, certainly won’t maintain any sort of viable social distancing."
"A seemingly meaningless gesture might be better than no gesture whatsoever.If Airports are looking to enforce ""social distancing,"" at Check-in, Security, Duty-free, Restaurants, Cafes, Bars etc, then surely Airlines will have to make an effort. There is no point keeping to ""Social Distancing"" as you pass through an Airport if you become a Sardine immediately you enter a poorly air-conditioned Cabin.CheersAnthony K"
"Saw this on an Islamic website.......""This year, Ramadan was expected to begin on Thursday 23 April and end on Saturday 23 May, but the crescent moon sighting convention meant that it actually commenced a day later.The Holy month of Ramadan ends with the conclusion of the celebration of Eid at sundown on Sundown on Sunday 24th May."""
"“A seemingly meaningless gesture might be better than no gesture whatsoever.“Meaningless gestures are, PR aside, by definition meaningless and therefore aren’t better than anything.As for the rest, it all sounds good in theory but you can’t operate a budget airline profitably by flying planes that are half (or more) empty. As for “trying to keep centre seats, of three, empty”, that by itself wouldn’t do much of anything.Edited: 5:03 am, May 04, 2020 "

"BBeckettWhat you might consider ""meaningless"" someone else might find to be quite helpful, Note I said ""seemingly meaningless"" which it may be to some.Stop being so childishly picky, and trying to find holes in what I write. Reading me more carefully might help.Anthony K"
"The likes of easyJet generally need 80% capacity to break even on a flight,so 1 in 5 seats empty is no cost to them.Add the parking costs of the planes,continual maintainence,plus any other costs of non operating Aircraft until a Vaccine is found.Being able to operate their fleet having 4 seats out of 6 occupied would be a dream for easyJet."
"I think the focus on reopening hotels is for the domestic market rather than the international tourist market. The end of Ramadan (anticipated 24 May but subject to sighting the new moon) is celebrated by Eid and many Egyptians will take holidays within the country. This is worrying the government hence the restrictions. They also want employees back in work. June marks the start of the annual exodus from Cairo to the north coast resorts for large numbers of Egyptians. Women and children decamp to resorts and hotels for the summer with men travelling north at weekends, a nightmare for social distancing!!"
"BBeckettWithout a massive overhaul of the filtration system, on an Aircrafts in-Cabin air-conditioning system, having been done, sitting apart will make no difference whatsoever. Both are necessary.Anthony K"
"A total myth about filters on Aircraft.HEPA filters are extremely effective and I would rather be on an aircraft for 5 hrs with their filters than an 1hrs 'rush hour' journey on a train.And yes,the rush hour Train journey will be the one that starts first - so it is just a case of risk management until further notice ........ Or until a Vaccine is found.We already live day to day with less severe strains of Corona - which for years they have tried to find a vaccine,to no avail."
"BBeckettNot exactly ... leaving the middle seat, of three, empty is a first gesture ... when combined with the work to the air-conditioning ... it makes a meaningful gesture ...Thus if an Airline does one thing, without pressure ... then does the second thing because pressure is applied ... OK.Anthony K"
"Yes,another Myth ,that leaving middle seat free would make aircraft travel safe-If you travel as a couple by creating the space between you,just pushes you closer to another passenger- pointless.It will be a collective of ideas which will kick-start air travel, beit - thermal imaging, disinfectant spray machines,face masks,blood tests plus many other suggestions.By the time Foreign Tourists are allowed,I think the Hotel restrictions will be less stringent."
"Re Post 30 ...I have been told, by Aircraft engineers, who know what they are talking about, that the air-conditioning applied when people were allowed to smoke, on aircraft, was more effective than that which airlines are doing now as a cost-cutting exercise. CheersAnthony K"
"You’re traveling in circles. By itself, leaving the middle seats vacant is an empty gesture. Upgrading the filtration system (if possible) might help but it doesn’t significantly reduce the risks associated with close social contact aboard a budget airliner flying at near or almost near capacity. If you want budget flights before a vaccine is ready (if it ever is), there are no easy answers."
Unless these so called aircraft engineers are leading experts in virology it is yet again as useless as your other posts !

I’m with Surreybloke.I’m an engineer for an Airconditioning manufacturer. I don’t work on aircraft but I know aircraft use HEPA filters and the air is changed twice as much as the average office per hour.The empty middle seats is a gimmick. I would have thought you would be at least equally at risk if not more on any form of public transport so they may as well restrict or stop all public transfer.I think the real risk has to be at what point the infection rate is in the country you are travelling from or to. If we were able to travel to NZ now then it would be us posing the threat and not at risk.

"#52 Catherine, it was a tongue in cheek joke! I was trying to bring some humour into making the point that everyone had already realised that only domestic travel was allowed. #49 implied that nobody knew."
WidI write clearly. I do not imply.Anthony K
Clarity and implication are not mutually exclusive.
#55What are you implying?
"#54, good you had me worried for a while!I did point out as far back as #27 that it was domestic tourism!Sadly most Egyptians don’t seem to have grasped the issue of social distancing yet"

“Domestic as in no business people or just local egyptians“Domestic (adjective)• existing or occurring inside a particular country; not foreign or international.
"You've lost me now. I'm not sure what you are asking but domestic travel is simply non-international. Journeys that end in the same country as it started. It's got nothing to do with jobs (cleaning, cooking or other!)Edited: 9:13 am, May 06, 2020 "

Please report and blockIts the same troll!When will TA listen!!
I've just asked the dame on another of these poisoned threads.
"Thought I'd put this thread back on track.Here is what will be happening when the hotels reopen next week. Egyptian hotels will be permitted to reopen on May 15th under several conditions that have been laid out in a meeting held by Prime Minister Moustafa Madbouly. The conditions set forth – in compliance with the WHO guidelines - for the reopening of hotels are as follows:GENERAL HEALTH & SAFETY-Every hotel must house a clinic and doctor.-All sterilisation and protective equipment to be sourced by suppliers approved by the Ministry of Health & Population.-Teams will be formed by the Chamber of Tourism and the Ministry of Health and Population to inspect hotels.-Weddings, parties and nightlife events are forbidden.-An area must be allocated for the quarantine of suspected cases, for both guests and staff.-Hotel staff will undergo continuous COVID-19 testing.GUESTS-Hotels must provide hand sanitisers at their entrances for guests.-Guests will check-in using a single-use pen or electronically.-Luggage will be sterilised upon check-in and check-out.-Guests’ temperature will be measured before they enter the premises.-Regular cleaning of all public areas in the hotels.HOTEL STAFF-Only 50% staff are permitted to be on the premises at once.-Staff returning from vacation will undergo a mandatory check-up.-For staff in coastal cities, a 60-day grace period between each vacation must be implemented.-There must be a housing area designated for staff.-Staff will receive training on COVID-19 health and safety regulations.HOTEL RESTAURANTS-Open buffets and shisha are banned.-Diners’ temperatures must be measured upon entry.-A distance of at least 2M between each dining table must be implemented, and at least 1M between diners at the same table.-A maximum of six diners at each table.-Restaurants should rely on single-use cutlery as much as possible.-Hand sanitisers must be placed on each table.-Health and safety guidelines must be distributed amongst tables.OCCUPANCY-Only 25% of all hotels (including day-use rooms) can be occupied at a time (until June 1st), after which the occupation allowance will increase to 50%."
Doesn't sound much of a holiday!Will cost hotels a lot all round.
"Me too, can't wait to go back at xmas. Or before.Really want their tourism to boom again. Will support them all i can.Just ignore trolls along the way!"
Interesting read...https:/…
Egyptian Streets is the biggest comic book of news written and would never go by what they write.95% of the tome us fake news.Sorry to say as w business owner then sone research needs to be done by some if you and I am not being rude.Do you seriously think the top brand hotels will open for 25% capacity then many live in dreams world and is totally not viable.....For example.Steigenberger will not open as coming to the end of Ranadan just to appease the local market?You think it will re open for 25% or 20 people from the UK that maybe booked into it when that happens?Let me also tell you Covid is rampant in Egypt it us not under control at all as the Government Claim and Luxor is one place you seriously want to avoid currently.Where do most hotel staff come from?Sorry but you are all nut cases if you think you will be back this year.With the restrictions in hotels you all call that a chilled relaxing holiday?Why do you not simply wait and like me with a business decide what I am going to do.Do I need tourism to survive yes but I can assure you the restrictions placed on hotels will cripple them further and that is why most are leaving the doors locked and the best idea.Do not believe what you read Covid is rife not under control bot 1 bit.....Simply people are not listening a bit like in the UK and carrying on like nothing has happened.Stop reading Egyptian streets it really is a farce of a publication.
"I read someone saying pools would remain closed when hotels reopen if so why?ive not much knowledge as some but I’ve read that places like Luxor,Cairo,hugardga have the highest numbers of cases threw Egypt unsure if that’s correct and excuse spelling mistake,surely if other areas are less affected than the ones I’ve listed like marsa alam they will open for business aslong as guidance and safety is met as otherwise I don’t really see anything hotel wise reopening as the economy in Egypt will fair a lot worse than most countries.8000 deaths compared to the uk total is nothing I understand that can and may rise drastically but I’d imagine tourism in hotels will have to reopen very soon or I don’t see any 1 returning look how they struggled in the past god help them but hopefully it will be fixed"
No hotels in Marsa Alam will te open as that is where I live and a majority of the hotels are being used to house Egyptians in Quarrantine that have returned from overseas countries.....Sorry living here in Egypt I see the real world and what is happening with the virus.Sorry but hotel staff many of them cone from Luxor and seriously I do not see the measures at hotels helping 1 bit no matter how much I want to support them or how many friends I have in them.Sadly and no offence most Egyptians are blind to what the virus is and like the rest of the world think they are invincible and it will not get them....Still meeting in big crowds and groups and it is shocking to see.Anyone rushing back is completely insane for the sake of a holiday or possibly death.Hotels will all close after Ramadan there simply is no point to keep them open for what little domestic trade there currently is.
"“...8000 deaths compared to the uk total is nothing.”RE #92 • It’s 8000 cases (8,476 today according to official data), not 8000 deaths. (Officially, it’s just over 500 deaths.) These are of course what the government admits to and things may be worse. However, I doubt the number of fatalities would be almost 17 times worse.Edited: 8:00 am, May 09, 2020 "
"Personally i think flights will be back on and hotels open around October if not before. Thats my guess and no doubt some will laugh at that but hey ho, we all have an opinion."
"Clint I’m surprised they have sent you an invitation as the government has stated the openings are for locals only. They also know that there will be no international holiday flights and, anybody entering Egypt has to go into 14 days quarantine. Me thinks guest relations have got a bit ahead of themselves!There is hardly any testing going on so how on earth they are going to get staff back from Luxor without isolating them for 14 days prior to them starting work after Ramadan I don’t know. As for official corona cases and deaths, the official figures quoted are a farce. Hospitals are full to capacity, sick people are being dumped outside hospitals and left to die. The unfortunate souls that have died are buried immediately with no testing or mentioning of Corona. Unfortunately, in my opinion, Egypt is going to be the last place to get out of this mess and it’s tourist industry will have been devastated."
"The last 2 posts illustrate perfectly the reason why I am not hazarding any guess at all as to when holiday traffic will recommence. It's happening constantly. One individual thinks one thing, another something different and the next has yet another view on things. Until it becomes clear what is exactly going on in each corner of the world nobody can legitimately even begin to guess. It's wait and see time for me but at some stage I'll see some wood in place of simply trees and only then will I get brave enough.to take a punt."
I wholeheartedly agree and hope it all turns out well for you. Some men were separated from their wives and families for 4 years in WW2 which is unimaginable and the women didn't know if their husbands were still alive. Thank goodness that you can at least keep in touch with each other and it's a fairly safe bet that you will be together much sooner than that. Take care.
Exactly.
"Here's my take on it .1/ Lynfort is right in that there's no point in guessing but there will be many many more posts doing so ! 2/ If prominent virologists don't know and contradict each other ' then we cannot possibly have a clue .3/ lockdowns are designed to buy time to slow the spread and not to get rid of it. 4/ Normal will only return on a vaccine being successful. 5/ Clint only got an invite because he's besties with AK .Edited: 1:16 pm, May 09, 2020 "
Just seen that Tropitel are reopening in Sahl and Dahab on 15 May and Sharm on 1 June. No mention of domestic markets only but with no flights it's a no brainer i suppose
I thought it was the government who had decreed domestic only so no option for the hotels. Perhaps I am mistaken.
"And on the seventh day, at 7pm, he spoke to his nation ... b'sh*t, but essential viewing this evening.Boris J will tell us of new restrictions for Airports, Ports, Cross-Bordering and Quarantining to begin from tomorrow.May make our outward journeys less easy and we may all have to quarantine, for at least 14 days, on our return from Hurghada.We live in unprecedented timesAnthony K"
"I think the biggest picture here is what Propoganda the Egyptian Government want you all to believe or what tourist hotels want you to believe.Any of you that believe a hotel will stay open after Ramadan and believe the Egyptian Government then that is your opinion.Kizzy says what I say also. You all seem to think Co-Vid is not rife here and 2 of us have told you me I am still here Kizzy could not get home.Sad to say what Kizzy is saying Dying people being left in the streets, bodies left outside Hurghada hospital the sad reality of the side the Government do not want you all to know.Under Control? What do you all class as under control?There really are some Stalwarts on here that need to open their eyes and wake up to reality.It may not say on hotels only open to Domestic travellers but it is true only licalbtraffic permitted and still why anyone would go to an hotel with those measures in place must have a screw loose.Good grief what do people not see here?The death rate officially is probably higher than the UK.The daily announced rate is comical.I can not believe there are people that desperate just to return and show solidarity OMG!Staff coming from Luxor no testing I am staggered you are all so Blasaie about things.I got an invite from steigenberger. Woohoo at least they get nearer their 25% and guess what all Steigenbergers are not opening but of you think your safer by going a well known branded hotel wrong..Kizzy has said it there is no testing locals will not listen to advice, markets packed, big group meetings.When you all decide to come back once Egypt lifts flight restrictions where are you all going to spend your mandatory 2 weeks quarantine arriving in Egypt?Not in your hotel that does not count it is in a government facility and that applies to all incoming visitors and mandatory no ifs no buts..Your 2 week holiday will have to be 4 weeks if you want a 2 week holiday and that will be in place for the next few months.Hotels are sending incorrect emails also and have had 1 myself earlier today from Three Corners telling me I was welcome to visit the hotel where in fact they have it wrong.I am a British Citizen with a Residence Visa that does not make me a Domestic traveller in the tourist market it clearly states Local Egyptians only for hotels but they will bend the rules and it can not be policed properly and this is the end of Ramadan do you seriously think locals will keep apart and respect no buffets? If any of you think this you do need to think.Sorry I love this Country it makes me sad trying to keep you all away and you do think your invincible. Co Vid is sweeping the country like locusts you seriously seriously have no clue because it is hidden by the government.You are all insane very insane to come back. Me I am safe. Luckily I have masks gloves and they do not leave my body until I get back to Apartment.Do not trust any hotel or travel agent it is safe it totally is not."
"“The death rate officially is probably higher than the UK.“Officially, it’s still much lower. Unofficially, it may be higher."
Either way Bbeckett the figures are BS supplied in Egypt.Probably fact that no way are they real statistics just what the government want us to believe.
"No doubt but the question is how much is the government downplaying the number of cases and the death rate? I wouldn’t think they could cut the real figures dramatically without coming unstuck but who knows? In any case, you’re on the scene and better able to assess what’s actually going on than the rest of us. Keep safe."
My post has been removed bu the bright brigade on this forum again who ate not the sharpest and will be drawn back to a destination rife with Co Vid.The figures have no meaning BBeckett and u like any normal country not 1 town or city talk to the next and would be the same and not share true figures but I can safely say the figures are higher than given out.It is quite ludicrous the amount of do holders on the forum that only wish to see their own verses.Hospitals are bulging at the seams and people are left outside of hospitals who are ill.All these people talking of can not wait to come back are absolutely shocking and have no thought and personally not particularly bothered what they all think are invincible.Anything slatingbtheir precious little resort or objecting to the truth in a post that they do not like.Too scared to listen to locals that live in the area.Wonder what they all going to do when arriving on a plane and have to Quarantine for 2 weeks and that is every traveller.Truth really is what they want to read on this forum is how rosy it all is but the truth you could not be any more cruel.Co Vid is like a plague out here and till most realise that then believe the fake news they keep reading on line being filtered out through Government channels then fill your boots at least I live here.I wish it was more simple but if you do not want the truth you do not have to read. It seems everyone wants positive only but the real reality is that is the truth.I have a business that is on it's knees but I can sea reality not grasping a piece of string.I really do not see how people once allowed in think they can do 2 weeks of Quarantine at a hotel? Sad.reality is the situation is far worse that what most are believing and think hotels opening is a good thing.Along with others that live here 9 think it's a disaster with no control.
"Well said Karen, I said the same in #97.There was a post on Facebook earlier of a doctor begging a minister to impose full lockdown immediately in Egypt, was removed within minutes.Stay safe Karen and I sincerely hope you manage to weather this storm. X"
#115Here is the post egyptianstreets.com/2020/…

My posts are being removed as no one wants to read the harsh reality and the cover ups because that is what they are.There is an enormous way to go here to get half way to reality even living normally.Hotels opening at 25% was literally forced on many and is true about Ramadan to save riots.The North coast of Alexandria is the same with wives and children ready to do the summer escape.Sorry if my posts are not what people want to read but no social distancing is being respected and till the country helps itself and understands then sadly we have along long way to go.Many hotels have refused also to re open and is not as many as you think.
Karen keep posting as it is the same story I am hearing from my friends in Egypt. Some of us want to know the truth and appreciate your efforts.
"To add to the atmosphere of conspiracy, I’m sure the Egyptian Government along with any and all businesses with a financial interest in discouraging what they see as bad PR and/or encouraging the immediate return of tourism, have people who’ve long ago joined TA for the purposes of manipulating the forums to further their perceived interests.This would of course include ‘pushing the button’ on posts they don’t like. I forget how many members of the TA ‘community’ it takes to get a post removed but it’s not many.By all means, keep posting but be careful.

"Many countries are suffering from Covid-19 equally like Egypt, I have family that live in the República Dominicana that own a business which is in the tourism sector.They have no tourism now Due to the pandemic.I've been told that they where used to welcoming three to six cruise ships a day, That is 8,000-16,000 paying tourists every day that ain't there anymore putting money into the Economy. This decease has hit hard All over the world and especially the country's that tend to Congregate more.Tourism won't be the same for years (as many of the workers come from the major cities that have high rated of COVID-19) to come or until a recognised vaccination is available.USA has unbelievable rates of dead body's in Hospitals, dead bodies left in hallways and trucks full of dead Covid-19 bodies waiting to be buried, I've seen videos of UK hospitals with dead bodies left in bathrooms and hallways in Hospitals.Covid-19 is affecting nearly all countries and lots of Hotels will be different when/if they return.Edited: 1:37 am, May 11, 2020 "

"I admire your thought of August 1st Anthony but considering any traveller including a holiday maker has to undergo 2 weeks of isolation and can not be done in a hotel then no it will be very far from normal.The main issue is every one here is burying their heads in the sand over it.The gatherings, curfews being broken and not enforced, shisha cafes still open, markets and public transport heaving.I am probably fortunate in my area as it seems to be hitting home and being understood.I have been doing my bit to help the cause again today and been speaking to a hotel owner that owns a few hotels of a well known group and told me 25% capacity would send him bankrupt. Like he said with the measures put in place for the hotels no one would keep to them and would be a shambles.I do feel for the tourism and my family said I should have returned to the uk but then this is my hone now.You can only educate so far but if the government do nothing to advise their citizens correctly and just shrug their shoulders and pretend it will go away then by August 1st it will be a disaster in Egypt.The hotel owner also told me how does he get staff that can confirm they are clear with bo testing?"
Not only do travellers to Egypt have to undergo 2 weeks isolation when they arrive they will have to do the same on their return to the UK. 6 weeks 'holiday' and only 2 actually in resort. Can't see that working.
"As opposed to any other type of holiday, I could very easily spend two weeks, if allowed, quarantined on a holiday complex, keeping to Social Distancing Rules, even without the Swimming Pool, and have a relaxing time.Anthony K"
"“...quarantined on a holiday complex, keeping to Social Distancing Rules...”You might be lucky but, strictly speaking, people in quarantine are isolated from one another and not just kept at a distance."
"Post # 140Absolutely, so it would certainly not be a bed of roses. Mind you, if I had to be quarantined anywhere I think I could just about survive this:https:/…"
"#141Yes, if you have to be quarantined, it looks a great place to pass the time. Personally speaking, it would certainly beat staying in some prefabricated, Red Sea beach resort with limited medical facilities and staffed by frightened people fleeing infected areas desperate for a living wage."
Oh WID that looks beautiful area for quarantine! Lol. Stunning Maldives:)
"Good news guys. Just listened to Simon Cowell's updates on Instagram. Someone asked if it was safe to return to Hurghada in November, and Simon gave it a five out of five and said 'I might even join you there'.Delighted to hear it because I am headed out to Hurghda on November 1st and can't wait. !"
"I really hope that’s Simon Calder, if not I wouldn’t hang my hat on any advice given mate !"
Typo Simon Calder lol
The shame of the predictive text lol
Shame on you Trip Advisor for predicting a post.
hah Wid I completely agree lol
Simon Calder is an Airline Expert and a newspaper columnist and has has his present portfolio for more than fifteen years. He is a Travel expert. Anthony K
I think everyone on the planet already knew that but it's so good of you to confirm it..
We could start virtual betting. November 6 months hhhhmmm stands a chance remotely but who knows.Was he not the one that said Sharm would be open in less than 12 months after the Russian plane incident?Saying that I seen a first thing ever yesterday litter pockets on the beach in Pirt Ghalib i wish I had odds on that and never seen that.Shame therex2as nothing for them to pick up.
"Anthony K, I don’t think you know what 2 weeks in hotel quarantine entails. When it started in Australia they used 5 star hotels yet many of those stuck in those gilded cages had a horrible time as they were given expired and rotten food, food that wasn’t properly cooked, tiny portion sizes and locked in their room 24/7. Multiple cases of mental breakdowns, at least one successful suicide and multiple medical emergencies such as a man who fell into a coma denied medical treatment for 9 hours. The 14 day lockdown in Egypt will fe far worse.Karen T is spot on, I’m here in Cairo and the trains are sardine cans (with slimy handrails) and there is no possibility of social distancing in most places.As for taking a holiday in a hotel with no pool, staff sticking a thermometer to my head every time I move and then dining with plastic cutlery....no thanks, sounds more like boot camp"
"Boot Camp ... with the sun at 40c. Boot camp with sun-loungers, tables and Parasols, on a beach, alongside the Red Sea. Boot Camp with All Inclusive food and local drinks and the Supermarket, close enough for a local to do your shopping. Boot Camp with a room cleaned and new Towels and Sheets, daily. Boot Camp with Alcohol, from Duty Free, sipped on my Balcony. Boot Camp with a Shower with an Umbrella Head and toiletries. Boot Camp with a Fruit Basket. Boot Camp with Bottled Water and Zero Coke in my Fridge each day., and an ice tray.Boot Camp without London...CheersAnthony K"

Guests in every other room. No pool, no games, no animation. Cases sanitized outside hotel before entry. Check in desk in garden. Your Temp taken.No buffets, only a la carte, 2 people to a table, 2m apart.Breakfast take away only.Throw away once use cups.No mattress on sunbed.

Egypt’s Minister of Tourism warns hotels to adhere to coronavirus operations guidelinesegyptindependent.com/egypts-minister-of-tour…
"Haven't read all 179 posts, but from where I am, International Travel in 2020 is not going to happen and not even considering it, yet every forum has threads hopeful of travel? We can't even travel interstate without 2 week quarantine at the very least.Any country that allows tourism now, without quarantine, testing or other controls is only concerned about money not health, and I wouldn't want to travel there."
...and I wouldn't want to travel there either. Totally agree.
The UK quarantine makes no sense though. It’s double standards at the very minimum.Have you been in a country with a large outbreak? -YESHave you been in very close proximity to people outside your household? -YES2 weeks quarantine for you! This would be for all the people we have seen loading on/off buses and tubes this morning on the media.

"I read today there has been a certain amount of 'bullying' by travel agencies to get customers to pay up the balance for holidays to Disneyworld in the USA for example. Many thousands of pounds was demanded by Virgin Holidays from families for the holiday in August, with no assurance that the holiday was in fact going ahead. How unethical and money grabbing can you get?. I do hope that Egypt takes more stringent precautions before allowing international tourists in. Since most of the hotel staff is from Luxor which has one of the highest rates of covid 19 infections, I hope those staf will all be tested, otherwise there will be another outbreak, upsurge in the covid 19 cases in Egypt. The staff of course, will all be desperate to get back to work and will not question anything. They have been without work or wages for months so all are keen to work again. I do hope the hotel management ensure their staff are tested and free from infection before resuming international tourism to again.Edited: 12:21 pm, May 13, 2020 "
"I'm not sure what Virgin is doing is much different from what the rest of the travel industry is doing to be honest......I have had to pay the full balance of two holidays recently in the near certain knowledge that neither are likely to go ahead.Not paying the balance leaves you in a very precarious position as you will in all likelyhood lose your deposit or at worst be chased for payment.There would be no recourse to your travel insurance as you will be deemed self disinclined to travel .I am sure the holiday companies wouldn't see it as unethical, just following contractual obligations on both sides.As hard as it seems, your only alternative is to pay up wait for a full refund in due course.Edited: 12:51 pm, May 13, 2020 "
"? AnthonyI hope they do well Clint, as you've said they're opening for domestic only. Panorama bungalows el gouna open too.

Lots of enquiries from Cairo, Alexandria etc, many locals wanting rooms.I do hope the hotels cope well and everyone stays safe. Time will tell."
"Heard from someone in El Gouna that the place is safe and clear of the virus (obviously don’t know if that’s the case or not), and hearing from people on here that Egypt at large is struggling with it.

I don't think it's funny nor are they lifting restrictions anywhere soon. Not heard of anything changing in Egypt.

"Follow up on my post re El Gouna from an eg facebook page:An Orascom employee has tested positive after being in town for 3 days, people are being urged not to go out unless they have to, to wear face masks, not to swim in public areas, don’t let people into your home etc etc.Quarantine:At present, the rules are that you will have to 7 days in Marsa Alam quarantine centre then 7 day self-isolation at home. Egyptian government are not issuing any more 30 day tourist visas. So until these items have been lifted it is more or less impossible for non-resident foreigners to come in.I have not written the above so don't shoot the messenger! Other people's words.

"“The Egyptian government has said that this is the plan to live alongside coronavirus, Which is what all countries should be doing.“OK but what does “live alongside coronavirus” actually mean? Does it mean with a total lockdown or with no restrictions whatsoever? Either way (or something in between) everybody is living alongside the virus at the moment. Countries can drop all the restrictions and go for herd immunity. This means some holidays will go ahead but it also means something like 60% of the population has to catch the virus. We can wait for a vaccine but do we do it with or without restrictions? Like most official statements these days, the Egyptian government’s is just political spin suggesting they’re probably hoping for the best and trying to work it out as they go along.There’s no sign of a “plan” (at least not a substantive one) in the Egyptian statement and, on way or the other, they (and we) are going to be living alongside the virus from now on."

No one knows until WHO say it's safe, borders open, Egypt says we can enter!No one has a crystal ball, everyone can guess, but no point until officials state.No point in keep asking unfortunately :( One day we hope to travel abroad again, until then we need to stay healthy, stay home, stay safe.Oh and stay alert!"
"For anyone wishing to fly directly from the UK to Hurghada, the relevant question isn’t so much “when will the Egyptian Government allow international arrivals again“ but rather “when will the FCO remove Egypt from the “essential travel only” list?If only on past experience, the first is likely to come before and perhaps well before the second."

Beaches are open at the hotels only. Pools are also open. It's mostly locals since airports are not actively flying and limited international travel. That said, the sea is lovely and warm. The water is so clear it's amazing since no boats and tourists to stir up the sand. Lots of fish have returned closer to shore in reefs and coral. Few people about so lovely to walk in evening. Take-out and delivery from restaurants available. Grocery store and pharmacy open. It's lovely here and what a great place to get stranded in...."

The levels of anxiety about being infected would completely annihilate the tiniest chance of enjoyment in these circumstances. I would be on tenterhooks 24/7. We're staying put for the foreseeable until the whole thing is over ... which I assume will happen at some stage.
"Clint I have read through your 'General Measures' list and thanks for sharing. What concerns me however that it did not include what surely must be one of the most important measures in terms of health and safety, namedly washing of hands. Soap and towels in staff toilets and also in guest toilets. Rarely will you find soap and towels ever in staff toilets. All too often soap is not replaced when it runs out in communal guest toilets.Also the washing of glasses. How many times have we seen them just swish in under the tap refill it and hand to another guest, No sign on washing up liquid.

Hi Orpandop.i have read on a few hotels rules that they'll give throw away glasses for drinks. You get your own mug for drinks on check in (presume you wash it out yourself in your room).Another stated wash hands constantly.I'm not even thinking about it until possible travel at xmas. Certainly won't be going if situation no better.
"Hi Caz. Giving out individual mugs and using disposable glasses is good. It saves concern about them not being washed properly.I had booked a flight for November, via Milan, it was such a bargain at the time it seemed to good to miss out That was early March when I booked before the lockdown, just £150 return. But I will see how everything works out before deciding whether to cancel or not.I see that Ryanair have started back with incredibly low cost flights to Europe from July. £30 to Corfu, Crete, land Faro, looks tempting.Edited: 12:58 am, June 08, 2020 "
"That's a good price Orpandop. I fly 18 Dec for 2 weeks from Stansted direct with Easyjet £275 inc bags.Unsure as to whether El Gouna/Egypt will be accepting tourists by then, just have to wait and see.Yes some bargains around as they want £ in bank of course.I'm due to go to Turkey mid August for 3 weeks (£125 return inc bags) and hoping it will go ahead as they're saying airbridge being agreed.A lot less losses in Turkey. Just want to see friends, family and clients.Fancy a £45 return to see friends in Amsterdam spring next year!Stay safe and well.Edited: 6:15 am, June 08, 2020 "

@246.. hope it doesn’t the place is a bit of a sh*t hole There is definitely better hotels in Hurghada Karen
"Panorama bungalows hurghada isn't open not is their far nicer hotel panorama bungalows el gouna.Hurghada hotel is slowly being renovated but I wouldn't stay there even if free.El gouna is far nicer hotel, area and staff etc."
We're booked to go start of December... I always make the most of a holiday so really excited!! Here's hoping it's a lot better in 5 months time :)
Glad to hear the Fort is up and running again. I hope they do well and can recover over time.
