"It follows Catalonia, whether the Valencia region follows will depend on rates of transmission/ infection Here is an article with more infohttps://english.elpais.com/society/2020-07-0…"
"Benidorm has rules about the use of masks.You must wear a mask anywhere if you can't keep to the social distancing rule including in the streets and the prom.Masks are required when you enter any shop or supermarkets. When entering a bar or restaurant you should wear a mask until you are seated.Be aware that the police will enforce any rules relating to social distancing and wearing masks and could issue large fines.I know it's not nice in this heat but it could save a second lockdown. Stay safe.SteveEdited: 2:38 pm, July 12, 2020 "
"In Communidad Valenciana the fine is upwards of 600€. Already I have read of Brits being fined and others being turned away from supermarkets for not wearing a mask.Edited: 3:21 am, July 13, 2020 "
"Different areas of Spain can set their own rules according to the situation.Benidorm is fortunate at the moment in that you do not need wear a mask outside, if you can distance, but must carry one with you.I'm going Andalucia soon, new rule there is likely to be ratified today, masks at ALL times. Fine 100 euros."
"I think the fine increases depending on, first offence, second offence, third offence. Bit silly of some holidaymakers to want to even think of going on holiday to a place and then not want to comply with the regulations of that area. Better to stay in some parts of the UK for you hols , for those who think it’s a massive chore to wear a face mask in a shop. Can see wearing a mask here becoming the norm. Seems to be talked about by the scientists more and more lately."
"I can see it only being a matter of time before the Valencian government say it is mandatory to wear masks out side at all times. Murcia province who are next door to the Valencian Provence are voting today on wearing masks out doors all the time, we all need to stick to the rules her wise we will be the same and it is not comfortable wearing a mask in this heat."
When are you going Blueboy? Maybe different rules unless your trip is in next few weeks?
The wearing of a mask is going to be until a vaccine is available ( next year) or the virus is gone.
"There might never be a vaccine, according to some experts. Just hope there is a breakthrough soon!"
If visitors get through the holiday season and beyond to new year and the worst thing is that they had to wear a mask a bit longer than they would like the resort will have done well.Atb steve
"# 11 absolutely spot on. https://murciatoday.com reporting that masks will be compulsory from today when outside the house, also that a number of other regions are in the same process."
"Yes jim catalonia and the balearics, andulucia from wednesday and murcia shortly,stricter rules will probably be national before much longer.Atb steve"
Six Covid-19 cases reported over the weekend in Benidorm.
How does the saying go? Seek and ye shall find!.
"Absolutely, testing in Europe has increased around 8 fold in 6 weeks. If governments thought having no positive tests was the way to stay on top of it they could just stop testing. Yesterday some of the alarmist press reported that the WHO had recorded the highest amount of cases in a day worldwide like it’s a bad thing."
"There will be cases of covid almost everywhere here in the UK. It makes sense to wear masks as it does stop the spread to those who really cannot cope with catching it. We all know that the majority of people will only suffer slightly from this virus, most of us understand that. Hopefully a large percentage of the majority will understand it makes sense and does help others by wearing a mask. It helps save the minority from suffering. Yes seek and ye shall find. The more tests done the more you will find."
"All covid positive cases are not all ""seeked out"" by testing but those that have fallen ill or turn up at medical institutions with symptoms.Atb steve"
"Per week the amount of tests is increasing, the amount of cases presenting themselves has plateaued and the amount of deaths has been steadily dropping for a long time. It’s not over and won’t be for a long time and we need to all be responsible and stick to the advise. My point is solely using the amount of positive tests as a guide to how afraid to be is a bad idea.Edited: 9:26 am, July 13, 2020 "
"I will wear a mask when I visit in September as that is the law.I will also drive on the RHS of the road. If I was not prepared to abide by the law I would stay st home.Edited: 9:29 am, July 13, 2020 "
"At #19, in spain? Ref deaths and walk up cases?Atb steve"
#15. Ignorance is bliss.
"@ #21 You agree testing has increased? Cases that present will not be asymptomatic so it’s fair to assume a linear relationship between the number of actual cases (not positive tests) Spain has and the number of cases that present with symptoms in Spain. Now we are months since the containment and delay stages we can plot a reliable 7 day moving average and that clearly shows a drop then a plateau in deaths, therefore cases rising and deaths falling is something to be happy about. https:/…Edited: 9:52 am, July 13, 2020 "
"Craig,Spains daily death count( when its available and there is controversey over its reliability) is increasing, as is in regions people presenting themselves to over stretched medical institutions irrespective of testing beforehand, think you are talking about the uk maybe.Edited: 9:59 am, July 13, 2020 "
"Did you look at the 7 day rolling average reference which you requested?  If we can’t believe the figures and stats Spain is declaring then there’s no point in discussing anything.Edited: 10:01 am, July 13, 2020 "
"I guess so Darren, I along with countless scientists, virologists,epidemiologists,I guess ignorance does not discriminate."
"Stop baffling me with science, my head hurts."
"Craig, some individual regions give higher daily death counts (cv19) than appear on the figures for the whole of spain and is a source of controvesey in spain and has been for a while.Returning regions to earlier phases of measures and stricter mask rules are, surely, an indication that spains overall position regarding this virus is getting worse not better, even though that may be relative.Atb steve"
"#27 that's not the science mally, that's because you had your mask on too tight lol."
"The glass really is half full for a few on here. I’m working as part of the research on this virus and with a few days off having a look at what is going on in one of my favourite places Lanzarote on the forum saw a few posts from people asking advise, I’ve replied to a few people with concerns to the best of my ability using my own knowledge and proper scientific research sources (not the BBC) to try to reassure them or at least clarify their concerns but it feels like there is a forum clique that like to advise based on their own fears or motives. To these people heaven forbid somebody should show any optimism.  Stay safe everyone, follow the rules unless you’re exempt and have the documentation to do so. It’s not professional of me to judge but I can just tell some of the people trying to shame others for daring not to wear a mask for a legitimate reason will be the ones that put it on their chin when they talk.  Remember you are most at risk at spreading it when you are coughing, sneezing, talking or singing.Edited: 5:15 pm, July 13, 2020 "
"I'm confused as to what both Steve and Craig are suggesting.I think they are both saying go if you want, but wear masks??Edited: 10:22 am, July 13, 2020 "
"Exactly that, stay safe and stick to the rules and have a good time. My other point that got lost is that a rise in the positive cases to death ratio is a good thing."
"Hello chris, i indeed believe following local rules and wearing a mask is correct, and would have no problem wearing one whatever rules are in place ( maybe not sleep in one☺) and would not prevent me from visiting.All the recent measures in spain including those areas that have introduced stricter rules, which valencia may follow does give an indication that all is not good in the hood in spain.Atb steve"
Thanks both.
The President of the Valencian Community's government - which includes Benidorm - said today that they are considering stricter rules on mask wearing and so forth. The decision will be made this week.Source; Las Provincias
"Totally overboard this. So if I'm on an empty road I still have to wear a mask? Its beyond belief! People are buying into this nonsense without hesitation. Its like a far-fetched, low budget dystopia film. Of course we need to be socially distant and I can understand having to wear one in enclosed spaces but come on this does not make sense. Worlds gone mad!"
"Walking along an empty road? I have a feeling you would get away with that. I’ve just received information that I must stress is not official but there will be exemptions in extreme conditions similar to the cycling crash helmet laws in Spain.Edited: 4:54 pm, July 13, 2020 "
"We travel to Campello on the Costa Blanca in less than 2 weeks. I'm quite happy with the current rules regarding the wearing of masks, however It will be difficult if that changes and you have to wear them all the time, especially in the heat."
"It's a good job we spend a lot of time in bars as once you're seated you don't have to wear one. Problem will be getting from A to B. However, it is what is is, and as long as it prevents a second wave and is a relatively short term measure, I am willing to put up with it, much as I hate wearing them (no choice really)"
"Blueboy, will do; no need to worry on that score. May even have to invest in a mask with a sip hole in."
