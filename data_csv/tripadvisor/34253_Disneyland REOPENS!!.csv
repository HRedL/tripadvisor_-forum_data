Nice. Definitely a dry-run for Anaheim and other Disney properties around the world. See what works and what doesn’t. Kudos to Disney working with the Chinese Communist Party!
This is a replay of the 2016 grand opening.
Wrong forum.
Unfortunately not comparable and not a dry run for US parks. Chinese citizens behave differently. They'll wear face masks and observe social differences. US customers would more likely pull out a gun and shoot you if you make them wear face masks.

"""Did you mean to write a jerky topic heading??""It's click-bait!"
We did not have enough traffic in the Anaheim forum and discussions about Disneyland.
">>>It's click-bait!<<<If only it was click bait I'd get paid for!The importance to the OC Forum and Anaheim, is Shanghai is going to provide a great road map for Disney to study.I still think FL will reopen before CA.But it would be nice to see a more definitive timeline, especially from CA so travelers know how to plan."
Good info on Disneyland Shanghai in these links.https://gizmodo.com/heres-what-shanghai-disn…https:/…index.htmlhttps:/…
"I’m happy this topic has been unclosed. Monitoring Shanghai Disney is useful to gauge how U.S. Disney reopens imho.As I mentioned in a separate comment, we might monitor how Tokyo Disney reopens, since Tokyo is in a freer society but peopled with folks who are excellent at following rules."
"I agree that Chinese citizens, and Asians in general, are more able to follow rules and generally care more about societal goals than just themself, unlike many Americans. And they do have a much longer history of wearing face masks in general, I've seen Asians wearing face masks while traveling, in airports, etc., long before this current pandemic. So I'm not sure it's a dry run that is transferable, especially to the US. I agree with #4.I imagine most people already knew it was Shanghai from the news, though. As for whether FL or CA will open at the same not or Fl sooner, who knows. FL is full of gun nuts, so maybe not a good idea there."
"The reopening is not touted as a dry one, but Iger and Disney officials have specifically said that they hope Shanghai Disney will provide lessons that will be applicable to the reopening of the U.S. parks. That the Asian visitors are rules compliant stems from widespread acceptance of science and an appreciation of the lethal threat posed by the SARS Cov-2 virus. That so many Americans believe this fake news or are even now lax about social distancing does not bode well imho, including for the reopening of the U.S. Disney parks."

Exactly Red. Let's not forget China locked down with an iron fist. We think we're doing the same thing wearing a mask. Not even close. We have a lot of foreigners here also that China didn't have to deal with.
International flights have been banned for quite some weeks. I think we're perfectly capable of infecting each other.
"Comparing Chinese and Americans ....that is what Iger and other Disney leaders have been and are doing in order to safely reopen your beloved Disneyland, Red. And it is Iger himself who was quoted in his Forbes interview about Chinese society providing safety outside Shanghai Disney to complement the safety measures to be implemented there."
">>>I cannot believe the territory this thread is covering! Comparing Chinese to Americans!<<<I am a Chinese American and I think in the context of this discussion it is pretty relevant. I said this on another thread too. Tokyo would be a better example than Shanghai to see what happens in a free democratic society without government mandated QR code health status when that Disney park opens. But the Japanese also are more rules following and accustomed to wearing masks. I am more interested in what happens at the Paris park since that park attracts more diverse guests than the other Asian ones. As big of a Disney fan I am, I don't foresee a visit for my family until a vaccine is available. I will just relish on all of our memories and binge on Disney + and YouTube."
"Tokyo Disney, which also includes DisneySea, is the only branded property that is not wholly or partially owned by Disney itself. Oriental Holdings, the owner, has a license from Disney. Paris Disneyland probably won’t make a decision about reopening its main facilities until mid-July....per news reports.Disney is a global enterprise, and it looks at its businesses in that context. Disney has even enunciated that idea: … And a world of fears There's so much that we share That it's time we're aware It's a small world after all…"

Tokyo Disney is scheduled to re-open on July 1. Most visitors are Japanese who are accustomed to taking responsible actions. ......so not a harbinger of what will happen in the two Orange counties.
