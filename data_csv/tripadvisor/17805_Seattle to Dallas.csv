Looking for a scenic trip for a week trip to end up in Dallas in 2 days actually relocating but have some time to get there
"I don't quite understand your timing. You ""have some time to get there"", but it's a week trip? It's a 30 hrs (4-5 days) drive. A scenic drive would be through Utah and Colorado But if you only have one week, you don't have that much time to enjoy the scenery."
"Maybe you mean .... ""I am leaving Seattle (Kent) in two days, on Tuesday June 23rd. I would like to spend a week driving to Dallas. I am by myself and will have my car full of my possessions."" Or maybe you mean ""I am leaving Kent on Monday and need to be in Dallas on Monday, June 29. I am driving my wife and two children, but we will only have suitcases with us. We enjoy natural beauty and walking."" Or maybe you're a twenty something with little regard for social distancing and you want bars & nightlife. Or maybe you are something else and have specific interests elsewhere.Share some additional details."
I am having to relocate. Timing is not the best but gotta do it! Ok thank you
I am relocating because of the epidemic and my job so...with 2 adults and 22 year old a dog. Was wondering about the route which way we should go. They have never left Washington and thought it would be nice to have some nice scenery.
"‘22 year old dog?’Dog may complicate things but anyway, here is one rough suggestion over 7 days.Day 1. Drive to Portland and along Columbia River Gorge. Stay along I-84.Day 2. I-84 across Idaho (could maybe divert off a bit) to I-15 to SLC, maybe stay around Park City.Day 3. To Moab Utah, see a bit of Canyonlands and Arches ( check dog restrictions).Day 4. To Durango via Ouray and Million Dollar Highway.Day 5. To Santa Fe, via Pagosa Springs.Day 6. To Amarillo, see Palo Duro Canyon.Day 7. To Dallas.There are other options like taking I-70 across Colorado, and south on I-25 etc. but the route above has some good and diverse scenery, and you can roll up some drives to do it faster or spend say a full day around Moab?Another more aggressive option in 6 days.Day 1. To Bozeman (or Butte on I-90) Day 2. Through Yellowstone and Grand Teton to Jackson WY, (check dog restrictions)Day 3. To Grand Junction ( or Moab, but limited time there) through Utah and Colorado,Day 4. To Durango via Ouray.Day 5. To Santa Fe.Day 6. To Dallas.If you have the extra day, you could add time in Yellowstone area, or Moab as before? If you have all your stuff then you need to take that into account."
Just a note that Moab is expecting 100+ temps later in the week. What kind of small breed dog do you have? Obviously you are aware of extreme heat conditions and canines.
