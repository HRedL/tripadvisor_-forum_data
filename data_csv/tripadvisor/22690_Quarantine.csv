Are US visitors to Vietnam being stopped. Quarantined and tested for Coronavirus?
"As far as I know Vietnam has closed its borders, to all foreigners ..Correct me someone if I'm wrong."
"""Correct me someone if I'm wrong.""There's been no official announcement of that happening, as of yet, Annie.Scott"
All arrivals have to fill out a form and are temperature checked.
Forget about it. Come over next year.
"baochinhphu.vn/Tin-noi-bat/…390114.vgp> Cách ly tập trung người nhập cảnh từ Mỹ, châu Âu, các nước ASEAN> Isolate concentrated immigrants from the US, Europe, and ASEAN countries'Concentrated' quarantine is in a facility of their choosing like a military barracks rather than just self isolate at home.So, my understanding that American citizens (no matter where they've been or travel from) will automatically be quarantined.And here's why:…chinhphu.vn/Home/…39225.vgpVietnam had done a stunning job of containing the outbreak until people started bringing it in from rich 1st world countries.TheVietnamese were stomping on Covid-19 long before the American government even started treating it as a hoax or joke, never mind seriously.Don't travel now."
I do not think you need to worry about quarantine as you will not be allowed in !
I asked a legit question. Really don’t appreciate your finger pointing. You may think US is rich but my son is not and saved for 3 years for this trip. And UK was slow in implementing Coronavirus precautions
"> Really don’t appreciate your finger pointing. You may think US is richIf that's a dig at me, Vietnam is far poorer than the US or UK and has done a far better job than either of those two countries at containing this. We should be ashamed of our performance. It's nothing to do with whether the US is rich or not. It's about *competence*. Vietnam displayed exemplary competence. The US and the UK did not. The UK through their usual bum,bling incompetence. The Americans by their refusal to take it seriously."
"""Really don’t appreciate your finger pointing.""Oh, please....Anyway, if your son hasn't arrived in Vietnam yet, I suggest you tell him it's not a good idea.It's currently a time to stay home.ScottEdited: 2:58 pm, March 18, 2020 "
I was in Vietnam last week on vacation. It was truly wonderful but by the weekend all tourist attractions were shutting down. I would suggest not going. You do risk quarantine. But more likely everything will be closed and possibility of border closing like many other countries have done in last couple days. People said they were turned away from hotels as well. This didn’t happen to me but I am of Indian decent so not blatantly from the west. Not sure your routing but it is increasingly difficult to get there wo transit through a banned country.
"I am a US citizen and yes I am currently writing this from a quarantine location. I arrived yesterday and to my luck I think the policy got started yesterday. I think almost everyone is being sent here, I believe even VN citizens who have traveled. Now isn't the time for anybody ."
