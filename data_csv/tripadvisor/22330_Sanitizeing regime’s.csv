"In view of what’s going on at present, anyone got any tips for what to use, what to do and when for cleaning plane seat area ( tray etc ) and WC. Also what’s best to get, either before or in Boots once in duty free ?"
"Just get some hand wipes like Purell’s.Edited: 3:26 pm, January 31, 2020 "
"Wrong advice ! Purell does not kill Coronavirus only a wipe containing Bleach like Clorox wipes are effective.Edited: 3:39 pm, January 31, 2020 "
Recommendations from the CDChttps:/…prevention.html
"I’ve never seen sanitiser that contains bleach. The link provided by a previous poster from the CDC suggests sanitiser which contains alcohol(something like Purell). That, along with rigorous hand washing is recommended."
What I’ve learned volunteering in a hospital where I visit patients is not just hand washing but paying close attention to finger tips and under finger nails when washing or sanitizing hands. And to do it often. FWIW.
I'd recommend one of these:https://tinyurl.com/sbgsoap
Alcohol. Must have some merit to this as it has become unavailable in stores here in Vancouver. You can't even get it in Amazon.ca unless you are willing to pay extortionate prices for shipping.
"'anyone got any tips for what to use, what to do and when' Wash your hands with soap and water, and do it often. 'for cleaning plane seat area ( tray etc ) and WC.' You could wipe down the tray table with an alcohol pledget, but are you going to wipe every surface after touching something else? When leaving the WC on the plane, use the towel you dried your hands on to open the lock and door. But with that, how will you get back in your seat without touching anything? Will you go through the process again after getting back in your seat?It's not yet known if nCoV is able to survive on surfaces or for how long. Outside an operating theatre or level IV containment facility it's next to impossible to have zero bacterial or viral load.Just wash your hands frequently."
"Wonder if there will be increased sales of the drinking type of alcohol on flights to be used for sanitizing, both inside the body and out? LOL"
"""Risk minimization"" ... nothing wrong with it and completely self explanatory."
"On yesterday’s flight, we used Clorox disinfecting wipes, to go pack. Wiped down trays, armrests, screens, they are touch screens, 3 movies, I must’ve touched that screen 50 times. Also TV remote control in hotel room. Paranoid? So what? Coming back to my hotel room in NYC just now, I used handkerchief to push floor button. If you are old enough to remember SARS and infamous No.9 floor button at Metropolis hotel in HK, where SARS started in HK, 7 people on 9th floor died. I am not worried about Coronavirus, I don’t want to catch a flu."
"Mac, have done the same thing way before this Corona virus. All you have had to do is see some of the exposes about the dirtiest things on planes and in hotel rooms to know that it's a good practice. Let's face it, how thorough of a cleaning do those planes get, even after the last flight of the day or hotel rooms?"
"I think that folk need to find a full hazmat station, and use it.Best of luck,Hunt"
"We always wipe down arm rests, tray tables, seat belt buckles and tv screens/remotes - we both have allergies (dairy and nuts) so it's a regular thing for us to do anyway. We've always got weird looks from other people when we do it, but we have to make sure we are safe!We've just stocked up on our alcohol hand gels and will be using them too when we are flying."
People really need to stop panickingTheres going to be more people dying of stress and high blood pressure as a result of excessive worrying :) lol
"At my wife’s insistence, every flight we have undertaken during the last 15 years we take a pack of sanitised hand wipes and clean all solid surfaces in our reach including arm rests, window blinds, inflight entertainment systems etc and then what we’ve done all this we use some wipes to clean our hands. At times, the grime we see is nothing short of disgusting, every little helps as they say"
"For years, I have been wiping down the solid surfaces on planes. And yes I can get from the WC to my seat without touching other stuff.As for hotels… sometimes I remember, and sometimes I don't. But usually I wash all glassware and mugs with soap and hot water. And will wipe down the TV remote, and beside light switches.Guess what… other than an occasional flu, I am rarely ill."
"It’s not difficult. Regard all surfaces as dirty, and that includes your own face, hair, clothes etc. Wash your hands properly before touching food, and if you use hand wipes, be aware that only 80% plus alcohol will effectively kill bacteria and viruses. You should wash or change clothes frequently too, and bath or shower after possible exposure.At best you will remove most micro-organisms, you will not achieve sterility in your surroundings on a plane, anymore than you do in your own home. The only difference is that you may be sharing your space with other passengers who may or may not be carrying flu or Coronavirus. It’s all part of life’s lottery, you are just trying to adjust the odds.Edited: 4:05 am, February 01, 2020 "
"I wonder how many people currently obsessing about the Coronavirus have refused to have flu jabs, either because they don't think they are necessary, or they don't like needles?"
"Internationally,150,000 people die of influenza annually.Just putting corona (and SARS) into perspective,,,SS"
"#21 ..... and don’t forget the anti-vaxxers! #22 .... I agree, it’s a small percentage mortality, the Spanish flu epidemic post-WW1 was far more lethal. It is a wake-up call for those with sloppy bio-security and personal hygiene standards but hardly cause for a major panic. Unfortunately, lack of common sense and increased international travel have combined to provoke intense media interest.There is always a nagging doubt that the next big pandemic is imminent, and when /if it does emerge, it may achieve more to reduce environmental damage than Greta Thunberg could possibly imagine!Edited: 5:22 am, February 01, 2020 "
"<< People really need to stop panicking >>I agree that some people are going OTP about this, but I don't think being more aware of one's environment regarding germs on surfaces and also one's hygiene is out of line. If everyone does a little bit to help prevent passing germs on to other passengers, how can it hurt?"

">>When leaving the WC on the plane, use the towel you dried your hands on to open the lock and door.<<I do that all the time in public toilets. Sometimes use my elbow if it's a simple lock. Re washing your hands properly, I wish people would remember to also dry their hands properly."
"People need to keep up with the current info- Purell has now been warned by the FDA to stop making false claims of effectiveness of its alcohol products. Especially today. People thinking they are safe are misinformed.Google recent info. Not historical data.Bleach products are required to kill Coronavirus.Edited: 4:03 pm, February 01, 2020 "
"Droplet viruses are very weak ... they die in contact with detergent, alcohol or anything that will dry their membranes. Caronavirus is a droplet virus so can easily be killed by washing and drying ... so no need to panic but risk minimization is sensible.So wiping down your seat area with an alcohol wipe will greatly REDUCES your risk of coming into contact with this virus. This information comes from my partner, an actual doctor."
I think the best thing to do is stay home. Honestly I Travel every week and I’ve never sanitize anything. And if you sprayed me with your Lysol I’m not going to respond well
"""Purell does not kill Coronavirus "" Totally untrue, poster 2. Please stop spreading false information. Thank you."
"I have seen enough conflicting information online that I will remove my post # 2 as it’s not my intention to be controversial.Good Luck to everyone.JMOEdited: 8:27 pm, February 01, 2020 "
"The warning letter from the FDA to Purell seems to state pretty clearly that their claims for their hand sanitiser haven’t been proven. Even with respect to the usual influenza virus, and the Coronavirus is an entirely different virus. Washing with soap and water is still the recommended first remedy and will remove virus from the skin surface. Hand sanitisers are recommended where soap and water are not available."
Poster 32: Read the CDC link. It is NOT conflicting information. I'll bet you didn't even read it? Just posted your opinion?
"Taland uncool, yes, I actually read more than a one stop shop, so hence the various slants on information. You are incorrect in that Iwas merely posting an opinion as you just have."
"Forget those ""various slants on information"" provided by news organization filters and the like. Why not just go to the source of the FDA letter provided here:https://tinyurl.com/wnkreh9Find out what FDA's issue with Purell is, then make up your collective minds. It is not about alcohol vs bleach or other disinfectant. It is about advertising claims made by Gojo Industries Inc for Purell products that FDA classifies as unapproved new drugs. The letter specifically calls out the claims for effectiveness against flu and Ebola and reducing school absences. The concern over the coronavirus COVID-19 had yet to manifest.And take a note of this paragraph in FDA's letter to Gojo Industry reps:“Are PURELL® Hand Sanitizer products effective against the flu? The FDA does not allow hand sanitizer brands to make viral claims, but from a scientific perspective, influenza is an enveloped virus. Enveloped viruses in general are easily killed or inactivated by alcohol. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are recommending the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer as a preventive measure for flu prevention”.These websites provide guidance for workers and travelers with regard to COVID-19:CDC: https://tinyurl.com/sqjj9avWHO: https://tinyurl.com/rcw6rlh"
"Do all those people who wipe down trays, screens etc on planes refuse food and drink too? Or do they sanitize the glasses, cups, plates and cutlery used for their in flight refreshments. After all, those are handled by aircrew and presumably the people assembling and stocking the components."
"I have read that hand sanitizers need to be at least 60% alcohol to be effective. I looked at mine and they are either 60 or 70%.I have also read that a good substitute if you don't have sanitizing wipes to wipe down surfaces like tray tables is plain old disinfecting or rubbing alcohol, or Clorox (bleach). I was looking at alcohol at the store tonight. It was like 91% isopropyl alcohol and cost about $1.50 a bottle. You could get a bottle of that and transfer it to smaller bottles for travel."
"""Clorox (bleach)"" I would really not recommend to take Clorox into an aircraft. It smells horribly, can leave stains on your clothes and is very aggressive to your hands (and any surface, esp. plastic touch screens)."
"'It was like 91% isopropyl alcohol and cost about $1.50 a bottle. You could get a bottle of that and transfer it to smaller bottles for travel.' CATSA addresses isopropanol (rubbing alcohol) specifically https:/…rubbing-alcohol and I suspect that for travellers in the States the same rule may apply. Travellers aren't allowed to carry alcohol-containing drinks with ABV greater than 70% and by extension the higher concentration rubbing alcohol may not be allowed.Having said that, a 50 mL bottle of rubbing alcohol in one's liquids bag isn't likely to get a great deal of attention, and if one wanted to take the 91% liquid it would probably pass without comment."

I see the idiot troll is back under a different name - again.
The most dangerous surface you will meet on a flight is the tray you put your stuff in to go through security.
"I am off to Abu Dhabi tomorrow but not ,thankfully, to the hotels where the cyclists are quarantined.I have never previously considered "" sanitising "" my aircraft seat or myself but I have purchased some Clinell universal wipes. If the blurb is to be believed they kill just about every germ you could mention including coronavirus. I am sceptical my strategy will be effective but I suppose it's better than nothing.When I bought them my pack of 200 was £6.99. Today from the same vendor they are £29.99 so someone is benefiting at least.I am not particularly concerned about catching coronavirus. Because of my age I am entitled to a free flu jab every year . I don't take it up.I am not concerned about being stuck in Abu Dhabi.I am concerned about the possibility of quarantine in the UK and this self isolation business when I get back home . IMHO the world has gone mad. This virus is like flu for goodness sake. I am sure that worldwide hundreds of thousands of people get flu every year and some of them die unfortunately. Suddenly the world collectively has had hysterics."
Linda.I totally agree with you!
"<< This virus is like flu for goodness sake. >>Is it? Being as it's a novel virus how do you know that? I doubt the WHO would be treating it so seriously if that was the case. With that in mind no one yet knows whether Clinell wipes will kill Covid 19. I've got some because they contain alcohol which should help with cleaning surfaces, if nothing else"
"Yes, should not be so flippant."
"Here’s the Sunday Times analysis.https:/…Broadly, the virus is infectious before you have any symptoms, the over 60’s are more at risk than any other group (over 80’s are worst affected). Masks on people with no symptoms are near useless, put them on sick people to stop them spreading the virus. Oh, and wash your hands (again and again and again)."
"""I am off to Abu Dhabi tomorrow but not ,thankfully, to the hotels where the cyclists are quarantined.""They were all tested and test results were negative.https://gulfnews.com/uae/government/uae-cycl…"
"I was in the toilets in M&S yesterday and there was a row of 3 ladies, all strangers, stood next to each other washing hands. One said ""I've just heard on the radio we should sing Happy Birthday twice"", so with that...................followed by plenty of hand cream lol.Edited: 5:16 am, March 01, 2020 "
"""Masks on people with no symptoms are near useless, put them on sick people to stop them spreading the virus. ""Agree. The mask you see the public wearing are more a sign of consideration than really helping. The only benefit is that people can no more touch with their hands their mouth and nose.People having a virus (incl. Corona): the masks helps to stop droplets to reach far. However, the mask let get through any size of particle we are talking with regards to a virus.Important is to wash your hands and to not touch mouth, nose and eyes with your hands.https:/…coronavirus-n95-face-masks.html"
Hopefully everyone will keep washing their hands regularly when this is all over. It would greatly reduce the instances of seasonal flu.
"We have 5 overseas trips booked, the next one to Athens in 2 weeks.Dug out my Purell I bought in 2016 and hoping its not expired (the expiry date is unclear on the base) and taking antiseptic wipes with us.It will have to do as no stock where I live and Amazon is charging hyperinflated prices and that's if it does even have any stock.Purell will go in ziplock.We stayed at the Hong Kong Metropole just after the SARS outbreak.Edited: 6:10 am, March 01, 2020 "

I don't know which as I didn't catch the beginning. The programme was not about the Coronavirus per se. But the intereviewer in the bit I caught, asked an senior A&E doctor why none of the staff were wearing masks.

"“A. Wiping everything- seats (?) armrest, headrest, food tray etc. down with alcohol wipes“You cannot wipe down the whole world so this advice is basically useless. A seat on a long haul aircraft has probably only been occupied by one or maybe two people in the past 24 hours. High contact areas in the airport like the already mentioned security trays, elevator buttons, escalator handrails etc. are more problematic.Better advice not specific to this outbreak:A. Wash your hands, dry them afterwards. B. Don’t touch your face unless you have just washed your hands. C. Sneeze and/or cough into a tissue and dispose of it properly."
Nobody does public bar snacks in open bowls anymore. That’s historical. Or just plain stupid.
"Summarised as "" Keep your hands to yourself, and wash them frequently! ""It seems people just can't trust themselves not to fiddle with the armrests, continually mess about with the headrests, food trays etc, and can't even leave their faces, noses and mouths alone for five minutes!Can they even remember to wash their hands?In fairness, there is a lot of confusing and conflicting advice circulating. I was horrified but not entirely surprised by the lady interviewed this morning who reported on how slack the quarantine regime was at Yarrow Park. She has been released from quarantine but quite rightly raised the question of whether the various governments know what they are doing. Quarantining but doing it badly is quite possibly worse than not doing it at all. And we now know that people already infected may not have any symptoms, and may also possibly test negative. Gathering a number of suspects together in one place without separating them from each other is asking for trouble."
"I have a trip to Spain in less than 2 weeks. I have a small supply of sanitizing wipes on hand but decided to try and buy some additional. I live in North Dallas and was out yesterday and all shelves are bare. The stock market here is down but apparently Clorox stock is up. Of course it is! Anyway, I found an unopened pack of the Clorox on the go wipes in my car so was happy to add them to my supply.Last week during a brief moment of panic I purchased an N95 3M face mask off eBay. It was $20. The seller contacted me the next day and said that unfortunately the individual masks are very hard to come by however they did have a 10-pack of masks that they could open and send me just one. They said they would put the mask in a zip-lock bag and send to me. They assured me it was ""completely new"". Seriously?! They are really playing on people's fears right now. I told them NO and to refund my money. Fortunately they did refund my money. I have decided not to worry about wearing a mask because I do not have any symptoms and hope to stay that way. It is also recommended not to wear a mask if you are healthy.I have always and will continue to wipe down the surfaces on my airline seat but I think this coming trip I am going to keep an extra supply of sanitizer handy.To the other poster who is hoping hand sanitizer doesn't expire - yes, it certainly does. Check the dates.Edited: 12:52 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"Check the ingredients of your Clorox wipes. The company is a bit evasive on its website, but most of its products are antibacterial only and rely heavily on benzalkonium chloride which is not effective against viruses.For covid 19 , current advice is that you need wipes containing 60% ( or more ) ethyl alcohol. Clorox lists isopropyl alcohol as an Ingredient but not how much."

Should have added that antibacterials have some limited anti-viral properties but are thought to be ineffective against covid19.
">>> Last week during a brief moment of panic I purchased an N95 3M face mask off eBay. <<<=======A N95 mask would have been useless if you were hoping it would protect you against the virus. They are used for general cleaning and in construction activities et al and are good for about particulates of about 0.3 microns, which is way too coarse for catching microbes and bugs.The only effective standard of filter is HEPA standard, which are expensive and have a huge pressure drops across them and need fan/presure assistance, they also only have relatively short useful life, before requiring replacement.Edited: 1:47 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"This ever growing topic has far more misinformation than good, practical advice.Folk with 'nasty' habits like never washing their hands (or just a quick dip in water and shake) after using toilets, not blowing their noses when full of cold or whatever but just sniffing, are everywhere, sadly. Standard anti bac gels and face masks are mostly useless, but may make the wearer or user feel happier that they're taking precautions. I just hope they did not pay a fortune or go on some wild goose chase to hunt these things down - that may have put them at greater risk than not bothering.Washing hands with soap and water properly and often is the simplest precaution.

"Bring a pack of wipes with you when boarding. Wipe arm rest, seat belt, food tray, IFE screen and remote. Bring your own headset. Don't use airline's headsets or blankets. There is a reason they get collected before landing: to be used over and over and over.When using the WC, use a wipe to open and close the door. Wipe off faucet and flushing knob and anything you may have to touch. Oh, don't forget your N95 mask. Repeat the wiping process at your hotel room. Always carry a small bottle of hand sanitizer.Enjoy your trip!"
"To the other poster who is hoping hand sanitizer doesn't expire - yes, it certainly does. Check the dates.--------------------Yes I know it expires which is why I mentioned it as the date is unclear and I bought the three 60 ml bottles late 2016. Just over 3 years old since purchase so I'll take my chances."
"Alcohols don't inhibit growth or destroy the organism but instead usually disrupt cell membranes and cell walls. The addition of something like chlorhexidine in hand sanitisers adds another biocide and slows the evaporation of the alcohol, letting it do its work a bit longer.An outdated product may not have the full efficacy of the fresh product but it's still worth using along with hand washing."
"@68“ Oh, don't forget your N95 mask.”Do forget your N95 mask (unless you are a builder or similar and need it for work) it’s as much use as a chocolate teapot for stopping viruses. You might as well put a pillow case over your head for all the good it will do you. And whilst washing your hands is clearly the right thing, the water temperature is largely irrelevant but the time taken and thoroughness is vital (so cold water is just as effective as warm, but less comfortable)."
"I heard that if you sing Happy Birthday to yourself twice while washing your hands that it's the right amount of time to spend doing it to be effective!Love it.Have been taking more time to wash mine (at home as well) and now have to use loads more hand cream as they're so dry!
