My passport expires in December 2020 and I want to travel to Grand Cayman in October 2020 for one week for a vacation. Will Grand Cayman entry be permitted?
"You should check on the gov.ky website or your airline. However as there is this time, why not go ahead and renew? If we have tourists back as soon as October it may well come with a quarantine period. Be sure to make sure your airline ticket is fully refundable if you don’t have 14 days + to spare. It is possible that other health documentation might also be required."
You need to update it. They have the six month rule.
"We do not have the 6 month ruleRequirements to be satisfied by visitorsA visitor must be in possession of a passport or other appropriate documentation that is valid beyond the date of their return ticket. However, this documentation does not necessarily have to be valid for over six months if this is more than the length of stay.immigration.gov.ky/portal/…entryrequirements"
"@futurewoman, do you have a reference for us for this?"
Exactly why I say for the really important not opinion questions get the info from the source.
"<< ""@futurewoman, do you have a reference for us for this?"" >>The post right below hers -- countering her assertion -- links to the official Cayman Islands immigration website."
"RJP I noted that, but it's happened before that the Cayman Government websites haven't been updated when changes have been made, so I wanted to find out what the source for this was."
Many years back the 6 month rule for expiring passports was the rule. Not sure when that changed but I only realized it a couple years ago.
Are you not able to renew your passport (due to COVID-19 or otherwise?)
I've heard the backlog for US passports is huge. They closed down offices for Covid and people were unable to process passport applications while working at home. My husband just sent his in and it expires in January I believe.
Sent it on today for renewal. Not sure when I will get it back.
"Because so many countries have the 6 month requirement a good rule of thumb is to expect the airline representative who decides whether or not you get on the plane to be absolutely certain that a country that doesn't have the requirement has it. Even though you might win you definitely don't want to have that argument when boarding closes in 2 hours and you still have to get through security. The air travel forum has had plenty of stories from people whose paperwork matches the requirements published by the country they're trying to go to but are told by the airline rep that something is wrong/missing/whatever. Renewing early is cheap insurance. The state department publishes data on Thursdays, and for the week from 6/11 through 6/17 they had 1.76 million pending applications and issued 154k. That was about 4 times as many as he previous week, so hopefully they'll get them done even faster as things open up. Even at 150k per week everything that's already pending should be done by late September, so if the OP hustles there's a pretty good chance he'll have his new passport in time."
"I would definitely renew now. Why leave it up to a no or low IQ airline employee to decide if you get to go on your vacation. Think of all the money at risk for your hotel/condo. If it makes you feel better, pay the extra $ for a rush on your passport. It is a drop in the bucket compared to the cost of your trip and the value of your vacation time."
"I would renew now and pay for expedited service. I sent in my passport for renewal in late January/early February using regular service (before Covid closure) and I have heard nothing back. Its like it is lost in space.Edited: 9:57 am, June 26, 2020 "
"I have a similar problem. My passport expires late September 2021. I have a trip to Cayman in late February, returning March 6 - Which gives me 6 months left on my passport. But then I have another trip reschedule to Ireland next July. The rules for Ireland say it only needs to be valid for your entire stay there. So I was thinking of renewing after Ireland. But now wondering if I should send it in when I get back from Cayman and hope its back in 12 weeks before my trip to Ireland."
