"Sorry but there is no good news, as long there are still people dying and getting sick.Don't need info from an Fakebook site."
Good to know a tour guide who is probably losing money hand over fist has first hand knowledge of the epidemic and its all good news.LOL
"Newspaper Courrier du Vietnam of 28 February (my translation) :The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC) has decided to remove Vietnam from its list of countries presenting a risk, saluting the efficient fight of the country against the epidemic of the new coronavirus (COVID-19)."
"Such an list doesn't mean anything and is no guarantee that there is no Corona virus, it's all around the world."
"Ah well, I guess the CDC does not know what it is talking about and you do !!!"
