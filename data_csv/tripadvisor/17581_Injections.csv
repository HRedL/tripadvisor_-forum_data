"Hi, do you need any injection when traveling to australia. We are doing all the touristy bits.Thanks"
A little like travelling to France or the US. Get what you would have if you were going there. I only tend to get inoculations if I am heading to Asia or third world countries.Did you get inoculated for Orlando?Oscar
"Sometimes we get some weird questions on the forums. Just curious, what gave you an idea like that?"
I would be asking my local doctor this question.......
We always get fluvax before we travel long haul. Planes are just the worst place for catching colds and other viruses. Other than that make sure your tetanus and polio vaccinations are up to date(which you should be doing anyway).
Mind you the last Polio epidemic in Australia was 1956. Australia was certified Polio free on 2000. Mind you they did pick up a passenger with polio from India. My advice is don't come via India.;)Oscar
"That may be the case Oscar but polio vaccination is still on the recommended (and govt funded list ) for ALL Australian children and my doctor has always made sure that mine (even though I am old and grey) is kept up to date. As with whooping cough, measles etc when we stop immunizing is when another epidemic will start unless (as with smallpox) the whole world has been declared free of the disease.Polio is still VERY common in many countries particularly in the Asia Pacific region - and not just India but especially in many of the Pacific Island countries. "
Addendum - sorry. For travelers its not just what they may catch here but also what they may bring in which is why for example you cant get into Brazil without a yellow fever immunization certificate and if you've been to certain other countries you cant get back into Australia without it either!!
"I stand corrected Nozzieary4kip, I have found a list of vaccinations required if travelling from th UK to Australia from netdoctor.co.ukVaccine recommendations for travelling to AustraliaDisease Recommendation When to see a doctor Typhoid Not required . Hepatitis A Not required . Diphtheria Not required . Tuberculosis Not required . Hepatitis B Not required . Rabies Not required . Meningococcal meningitis Not required . Yellow fever Certificate of vaccination may be required 10 days before travel Japanese B encephalitis *Vaccination sometimes recommended 1 month before travel Tick-borne encephalitis Not required . All travellers are advised to ensure that tetanus and polio vaccinations are kept up to date.Recommendations do change from time to time and it is important to discuss your personal requirements with your doctor.Malaria recommendationsThere is no risk of malaria in this country and no preventive measures are required.Oscar"
"Thank you all for your replys, You've all been very helpful."
"Regarding the yellow fever vaccination, my understanding is that it is only required if you have been through one of the 'endemic zones' (usually listed as central Africa and South America) - is that correct?"
Yes -correct!
