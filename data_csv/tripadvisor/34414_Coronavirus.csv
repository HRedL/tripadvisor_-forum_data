Anyone still traveling to Ontario. I have a trip in beginning of April that's booked already. It's gonna cost a lot to change the date because these airlines (air canada and copa air) are only waiving fees for flights booked in March. I'm torn because I am traveling with my toddler.
"There are only a handful of cases here, all linked to international travel. Also, children are not at increased risk. Indeed the evidence to date indicates they either don’t get sick at all or get mild cases. I don’t think there are any children in all of Canada that have been diagnosed with it."
The CDC is a Canadian Government agency which has info on COVID-19 so that the general public can inform themselves and make informed decisions.Here is the link: https:/…index.html
There's no reason to worry. It's not a significant issue with very basic precautions.
"The CDC is the American Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention. The Canadian equivalent is The Public Health Agency of Canada.As of a couple of hours ago there were 51 cases throughout Canada but the number of cases are quickly increasing as they are in other parts of the world and we don't know how the situation will be in 1 month.Edited: 5:55 pm, March 06, 2020 "
The knowledge about what will it be like in April is the same as asking for the weather the first week in April. at this point NOBODY knows.
"Thanks for posting that, RT. What a great and reasoned commentary from a knowledgeable source!! Amen.Edited: 9:14 pm, March 06, 2020 "
+1 from myself as well.
Thanks for posting. I've been saying that the world is going crazy and it's out of fear. I continue to plan for my trip but will keep alert of any relevant news on developments.
"RT,I have copied your post of the F/B post from the good Doctor on to a thread on the Cruises forum which is going a bit OTT.https:/…105908975Edited: 8:34 am, March 07, 2020 "
Tripadvisor has just added a COVID-19 information bulletin with an orange button at the top of all main forum pages.
"be CAREFUL what you read. Found on the Trip Advisor Orange Button:Washing your hands regularly with an alcohol-based sanitizer Found on the CDC site:Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty."
