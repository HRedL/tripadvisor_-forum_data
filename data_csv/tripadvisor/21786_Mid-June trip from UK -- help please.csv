"The foreign office just advised no unnecessary travel from UK for next 30 days. I need to make a decision about our mid-June trip so need help. I have underlying medical conditions (declared on insurance). I've booked through a specialist travel agent in UK and need to decide pretty much by end March whether to proceed with trip. I booked flights through Opodo. Does anyone know if you can move flights when booking via an aggregator at the moment? I've done it in the past for a fee, but these are different times. It looks like we're about to be told to self isolate for next three months (elderly and those with underlying conditions). So, basically it's a bit of a mess. Any thoughts/experience would be much appreciated. Tx"

"hi, my friends booked their flight from a travel aggregator but I think you can only refund/reschedule not changing the route. You can also asked your flight operator to change it. I think it'll be better for you to refund your flight and your trip for now especially since Japan ask people from a list of country to self quarantine for 14 days first before they go on with their travelling"
"We don't need unnecessary venomous posts in this forum. If you have nothing concrete to contribute, it's fine to ignore the thread and move on. If anything, your post should be reported as inappropriate and removed. >>>Lazy panic post, everyone please ignore and let this thread die.As to OP's question: you should not plan to travel if it means committing to anything non-refundable. None of us has a crystal ball. The situation can last for 30 days, 60 days, 90 days or more. Since you have an underlying medical condition, you are also at much higher risk should you decide to go."
