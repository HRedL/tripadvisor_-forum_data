Bottom line is simple.No one needs to go to Cuba right now for any reason short of a dying close relative.Nobody needs to see family or friends so desperately that you run the risk of infecting them with covid.As far as going for a holiday on a resort that is just pure selfish.Some might say Cuba needs us not really they don't need us just our money.Covid is evil and has caused many hardships our only real weapon against it is to stay at home
"Your opinion.It can be said that no one needs to ever leave home now, not even for food, but we may all join a cult and agree to end our life tomorrow."
">>>As far as going for a holiday on a resort that is just pure selfish<<<I don't see how you can call it selfish. It may possibly be unwise at the moment, but i can't see how it can be deemed selfish."
What I said was our only real weapon against the virus is to stay at home.Of course there are certain reasons you must leave home but a trip to Cuba is not one of them.That is my opinion you can disagree if you like but to say we could join a cult to end our life tomorrow is just plain stupid and has no relevance to my comment or to anything.
There is no reason to stay home. You can get things at home. You are saying stay home so you may as well end your life if you are not going to live it.That is my opinion.And you are totaly out of order calling everyone selfish to want to live their live.Good luck next time you go to Walmart.
Unwise is a kind way of putting it.I still call it selfish to put people's lives at risk just so you can have a holiday.You can holiday when this thing gets under control the person you may infect and die will be dead.How can you not call this selfish.
"So you are going to call the people, who will mainly be your fellow countryman, no doubt, who travel to Cuba as soon as flights recommence selfish then? Because when they fly I'm sure the virus will still not be under control."
That is your opinion many have the same opinion and I do see what you are saying.It is extremely difficult to put our lives on hold but the numbers don't lie.I don't like it any more than anyone else.My point still remains the same the only real way we can insure we don't get it or spread it is to stay at home.Second best is to follow the guidelines put in place when we need to leave home for essential reasons.A trip to Cuba is putting an extra risk on Cubans they do not need.So I still call it selfish even if no one agrees.
Not just my countrymen but from anywhere.Why would anyone want to fly to another country while there is a risk of spreading the virus there.How many people have died so someone can enjoy themselves at a party or at a beach in their own country. Now they want to spread it to another country so they can enjoy themselves there.How can you not call it selfish.
"I can see that that, do we need a vacation that bad, or can we wait a few more months, until things are a little more stable (hopefully). We don’t want to give anything to others, especially the staff. I can see wanting to see family, that’s totally different than a vacation."
"Ratwalto, I hear you. I’m not gonna say I think people are selfish for wanting to go away but if we want to get this virus under control people need to stay put. I do believe though that a lot of people are suffering due to the lack of tourists on some of these islands. I feel like it’s damned if you do damned if you don’t."
"Hi,So the poster wants us all to stay home, bake cakes and play online poker all day?Have fun."
"My province isn’t saying stay home except for essential things. My province is saying go out and support the economy/live your life but do it in safe manner. Unfortunately a lot of lives are being lost and ruined from things other than covid or secondary too covid ... Once my country allows travel I’ll see if it’s something I’m comfortable with depending on what our status is here at home and where we plan to go abroad (including Cuba).Edited: 9:35 am, August 08, 2020 "
@11 It's not got anything to do with fun.Stay home limit the spread save lives.That's what it is about.If you can't wait tell the numbers at least come down a bit before you go on holiday or go to a party the beach or a bar then go.Maybe you won't get it maybe if you do you won't infect your entire family.
"“So the poster wants us all to stay home, bake cakes and play online poker all day?”Yes, for now. It’s not the time for international travel."
"sad to say, my opinion. Even with the temperature taking and the Cuban virus test, Cuba's international tourism on those cayos won't last that long. Once the Russians land and then start mixing in Spain, Mexico and Canada turistas, with the Cubans, one would have to think there will be more than one outbreak. And, one would have to think that there will be more than a few Canadianos that come home with the virus and many with a nice tan or sun burnt. Seems to be es vida now a days."
well said gerry and ratty! carol e.
"Well, when somewhat safe to do so, we will be going back to Cuba.They DO need our money and I always accompany MY money when going on holiday.......;-)Things hopefully will have settled by next spring but who can tell until it does.Greg"
Camajuani is now under lockdown due to Cubans returning from abroad.I think the number was 8 cases so far.This certainly tells me travel to Cuba at the moment is not the greatest idea.
"Actually no, it was residents who went to Habana (even though those from outside provinces were not to travel in and out of Habana) and brought it back. Sorry to say it, some internally who do not follow the rules are creating the problem. Actually very similar to here, if you think about it."
I could be mistaken but I did read a lot in that thread about it coming in from out of the country.I still think however no matter what avoiding travel to Cuba until the numbers look at lot better than they do now makes sense.
"I get what you are trying to say, really I do,I have missed 3 - 14 days trips not as a beach vacation, but to stay with family and continued to remain here and work. You ok, if I rent a cottage at Halls Lake for a month and hang around with you and the local residents? Is that any different?"
The one difference is you would not be hanging around me.The fact is no there is not a difference.Other than perhaps the airport plane ride and people from other countries at the resort may increase the risk.Since some restrictions regarding travel here have been lifted we have seen an increase in our covid numbers.While our numbers are still extremely low there has been a slight increase.
When the numbers are right you can come up and have a grand old time especially if you like fishing.But for now my place is off limits to everyone.
People’s country and home life must be pretty sad if they can only think of using up ther vouchers and sitting in the sun.
"Was that a shot dense? :) It's like you're grouping all Canadians into one voucher :) You don't have to type everything you're thinking dense especially those insulting thoughts :) There's a similar chipmunk on here, you must know him :)"
"Well with all the talk earlier on this forum about when will Canadian airlines start flying to Cuba again, by the looks of what Canadians are saying on this thread they won't be flying to Cuba anytime soon so all the AirTransat, Sunwing and Air Canada flights will likely be pulled as there will be not enough passengers to make it worthwhile flying."
I’d love a holiday having been going out to work every day during this pandemic ( some weeks 7 days a week). Physically knackered comes to mindBut the Cuban borders are closed so can’t
"Post 27.But the Cuban borders are closed so can’tNo they are open, depends where you want to go"
"@24) That’s a silly thing to say...of course those of us with vouchers, think of using them, why wouldn’t we, not going to just forget them. I plan on using mine when it’s the right time to go."
"@lori ... I’m sure the airlines want people to forget about them. It doesn’t hurt to daydream, it is actually helpful to get through these tough times! Once quarantine is lifted, there will be a lot more movement!"
"well said ratwalto . 100 percent correct. Going to Cuba or another destination for a vacation is SELFISH irresponsible, foolish and stupid. People are dying and at the same time someone wants to go for a vacation to Cuba. Shame on you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Post 31.Same can be said of you going to walmart. You can catch this anywhere at any time.
"I'm going to just stay at home for now and dream about using my vouchers one day, my summer of isolation is going quite well on Lake Erie, the weather is like Cuba some days! I agree with the OP, it is not worth risking spreading the disease or catching it at this point, hopefully things improve! and safe travel will be a reality instead of just a dream!"
"Our Cuban friends know we will come once it's safe. For many, that will be after a safe and reliable vaccine is available. In the meantime Walmart for 10 minutes with mask and precautions is safer than 2 weeks south.A Facebook page was recently started where people share methods of providing help to Cubans now, for those interested:https:/…"
"Spunky, just had a look at that Facebook page (joined), not sure how some of that works but will research it...thanks."
"I don't need to go to Cuba , but I sure do need Cuban Coffee and Cuban cigars I can't get on the internet. I can't wait for the country to open up down the road."
All I saw was a lot of food.
@32 That is twice you have mentioned Walmart.Going to Walmart has nothing whatsoever to do with international travel.Walmart is a shopping trip.Hopefully you go only for essential items follow the guidelines while at the store buy what you need and get out.International travel for a holiday comes with a lot more risk and is never essential.Add to that the fact that you run the risk of spreading covid to another country or just as bad bringing it home with you.
"I avoid walmart even when there is no pandemic, I don't like shopping much and that seems like one of the worst places with out of control children, I have tried to do my shopping locally, when I travel out of town I bring all the required essentials to avoid going into a store in a different jurisdiction! Everyone has their own idea of what is a risk and how much it is worth taking, sadly some poor decisions are keeping this virus prevalent in some areas!"
"Went to Walmart on Friday, put on a mask, stay away from others, just get what I need and I’m out of there. In fact, there was hardly anyone there.Edited: 11:32 am, August 09, 2020 "
Sadly some poor decisions are keeping this virus prevalent in some areas!Gator here brings up another point not touched on yet.How much easier would it be to make those poor decisions when you throw in fun sun and alchool at an AI resort.I also hate shopping avoid at all cost.Fortunate for me my wife loves it.
"Let me explain the difference between going to walmart and going to Cuba People go to walmart because they have to go this is necessarily. They are buying bread, milk, cheese, meat, fruit …..You do not have to go to Cuba. Beside in Canada. Federal government advise people avoid no-essential travel . Do not expose yourself and many others. to THE VIRUS. Do not be SELFISH , be RESPONSIBLE I hope this is clear. Please be smart do not travel unless it is NECESSARY."
No need to explain...I think we get it..but thanks anyway.
For those of you that still don't get the stay home concept look at it this way.The Cuban govt will take whatever steps it feels necessary to combat this virus.Right now they are taking a chance allowing some cayos to receive tourists at AI resorts.I sincerely hopes this works but I don't like the odds.If it does not it will be back to square one or worse.The numbers are still way to high to consider international travel at this time.Bear in mind international travel is how this thing spread worldwide.
"Reply #32, correct, one can catch it going to the doctor or going into the local 7-Eleven to buy one apple."
You can't catch it staying home.Limit your outings to only what you need improves your odds of not getting it.
"Essential travel?? What is essential?? In a perfect world, if everyone just simultaneously stayed at home and self-isolated for up to a month... the virus would completely disappear on the planet. Again, in a perfect world.However some of us essentially need to travel outside of our houses on a limited basis for a multitude of different reasons. Likewise, some of us essentially need to travel to Cuba for a multitude of different reasons... none more essential than to be with our Cuban spouses and loved ones, as I do. Going to Cuba for a vacation is likely the least important reason to travel there any time soon though... and certainly the least essential. BUT! I put a lot of faith in our combined governments and their proactive science. If both Canada and Cuba determine together and tell us that it's safe to do so, then I have no problem with anyone traveling to Cuba and back for any reason at that time. If it all goes for $hite, they can quickly shut it back down again. But nobody knows with confidence what exactly will happen unless they/we try. Trust the science and don't let your anxiety get the better of you. Terry"
Bear in mind the best love you can give them right now is to stay away.You are not the problem I am sure you would take extra precaution to remain covid free.But by opening up you will also get those who have a total disregard for themselves others and the virus.You must hang in there and wait it out.The pain will be gone once you are reunited with your loved ones.Think about that and what a day it will be.
"You ever write a long post, only to stop halfway and think “what’s the point? They won’t understand anyway.”“wait it out” — hah."
"The 'science', for now, avoid nonessential travel, stay in a bubble, get out and about but take safety measures, don't rush be patient, jezz i'm sounding like the W.H.O. like every one is 10 years old, protect the elderly and ones with underlying conditions, quarantine if told. Seems they are on the see saw about eye protection and distance and science still seems to be learning about this virus. Faith, would it of been better for governments to spend a lot more of their 'stimulus' money on protection, testing, treatment and vaccine instead of rich/large corporations. May every one have a good Sunday!"
If you have an opinion about my previous post voice it.Otherwise don't bother posting about what I might or might not understand.

Nor would I want to everyone should be free to say as they wish.Just curious about about what I do not understand.Rather than simply being rude perhaps you could attempt to make me realize what I do not understand.

Oh, yes, it loves the other C, Cuba, but Cuba knows how to defeat this thing, while opening up to isolated tourism. Rat, How can a virus be evil? It has no brain with which to scheme evil plans! It is patronizing to the Cuban people to say stay away as if they cannot manage this pandemic. A philosopher may argue that ALL travel is self-serving. Flying dumps carbon.

But I also have medically compromised friends and family. How do I know I will not be close to an asymptomatic person at either airport or on the plane? I don't. I could become infected on the plane and four hours later, test negative at the airport, then three days later test positive. There have been, in my city , false positive and false negative tests. Do I want to be quarantined in Cuba for 14 days? Do I want to fall ill there and end up in hospital?No, even though I know several doctors there and have no doubt my care would be as good as possible. And worst of all, do I want to run the risk of infecting someone I love? NO!!!! Cuba will be around forever. No matter what anyone tells you, there are ways to send money there. Cuba survived the collapse of the USSR and the decades long embargo. They will survive without a year of tourism. Plus, the people I know with Casas and Paladars in my neck of the woods are in no hurry to reopen at this time, even to fellow Cubans. Don't get your knickers in a knot.

"@Jovier ... I am also a frontline healthcare worker in Canada. My comments had nothing to do with international travel ... the ‘stay home and flatten the curve’ messaging is no longer current messaging, even in Ontario. You can go out safely at home in Toronto, it’s true! I never once said international travel right now is encouraged or safe, I was speaking to at home!Air Canada and Westjet have been offering leisure trips since June. Air Canada had the first leisure flights to Cancun."
"@jovier “” We should focused now on putting children in the school, putting people back to work , moving economy.”You reiterated my exact point. People in this post keep saying ‘stay home and only go out for essentials’ and I said that messaging was outdated as we are encouraged to support the economy by following public health guidance and keeping our circles small ... we can and should go out but do it safely. That was the point of my post. If people only stay home and go out for essentials we can’t get people back to work and support the economy!"
Thank you candy.A person with serious reasons to return to Cuba has just told you they are not going at this time.
At some point the govt realized that the restrictions in place were taking too long and were somewhat ineffectiveThey realized the economy could not be shut down forever.Now it is more about the economy and less about the virus.. The experts mean nothing if their advice is not taken.The biggest problem from the start was covidiots that thought the restrictions did not apply to them and it still is.
"The shutdown wasn’t to eradicate the virus. It was to slow the spread to give the system time to cope and not become overwhelmed. In many provinces we never even came close to any of the early projections which is good! But the toll this has taken in so many other areas, not just the economy can’t be pushed under the rug either. There has to be a balance and things need to open up, albeit safely. There will always be ‘covididiots’ and there are in every single country. We are all seeing similar patterns, like raises in the 20-39 range, lots of house parties or nightclubs. It’s unfortunate! I will just continue doing my part and going to work each day to support the covid effort."
"Hello I hope this is my last statement.Please put you international travel on hold. Stay local, support the local economy , do not put unnecessary stress on health system, be responsible, keep social distance, wear mask, wash hand frequently, report any irresponsible action to local authority, be smart stay healthy. CheersI hope I am going to meet you some day in Cuba in my favourite beach Ensenchos. Hasta luego amigas and amigos Sorry my Spanish is very bad. And of course Boycott Sunwing Sunwing simple the worst . Cheers"
If from the beginning people listened and followed the restrictions we would be far better off than we are now.As things open back up I see more of the same.I do realize that staying at home is somewhat unrealistic as we must get the economy rolling againHowever the only sure fire way to not get the virus and spread it is to stay at home.If everyone met and exceeded the restrictions still in place opening up would be fine.It is just so many many people did not and will not follow the simplest of restrictions.This is what hurts us all.
I am no great fan of Sunwing but if you boycott them you might as well boycott them all.All their planes will be in the air as soon as they are allowed to be.Profit over safety is the airlines golden rule.
It is unrealistic and gravely so for some. People are losing their homes and their businesses. Things they’ve worked so hard for. A family sitting at home still bringing in 2 incomes definitely would see it different than a family with 2 on CERB who can’t make ends meet. It’s awful from so many perspectives.

Compared to some I have got off easy but I have lost thousands since this began.I have remained steadfast and followed all the restrictions in place.When this is over perhaps I will take comfort of the fact I was part of the solution not the problem.We rely on seasonal business here where I live and many business's are closed still and will never reopen.

"Reply #90 :) it really isn't sarcasm :) There will be a time again when 10 in 10 Canadian Doctors say, go! fly! leave the country! and enjoy your vacation! depending oooon ones health."
I would be willing to go with that.If enough Doctors were to give the okay to travel internationally I would think it's time to return to Cuba.I would trust the Doctors more than our government or any government for that matter.
"Can only hope to visit Cuba in the following year. Am not comfortable travelling right now. No way it'll happen. what I can't understand is that Dominican Republic is taking in tourists. The Anericans are travelling like crazy now. Can't imagine that.Edited: 8:16 pm, August 11, 2020 "

"Selectivedi wrote, “The Americans are travelling like crazy now. Can't imagine that.""***You crack me up. It is their right and privilege to travel (wherever anyone will take them). Fortunately, our (Canadian) border is still closed to tourism from the USA. That’s not to say that some Americans aren’t dishonest through their teeth at border crossings. ;-)"
"selectivedi #93: I am curious where you are seeing ""Americans traveling like crazy"". I know a lot of us who travel frequently but are staying at home. I have cancelled one non-Cuba international trip this year so far this year. My sister has cancelled three international trips. My son and his family have cancelled three international trips. Now nobody ever goes to resorts though. Are all of these crazy traveling Americans the resort people? BTW, all the resorts around us in Orlando (Disney resorts and other similar) are experiencing low occupancy. Airlines are seeing very low booking rates. Even my daughter who is a personal flight attendant for private charter jets is home half the time. I just don't know anyone who is traveling."
#96 Bob... did you and your family cancel international trips because of bans on US folk travelling or because you didn't feel safe travelling? I seem to remember from earlier posts you were travelling to Spain? That would have been banned by EU / Spanish restrictions on American travel.So if DR is open to the US then it's not really surprising that it's busy as populations generally like to travel... the mad rush to Spain when restrictions were lifted in the UK is a fine example.I'm sure that once Cuba opens you'll find a large number of travellers visiting because they can.... perhaps not from the US as the percieved difficulty of travel to Cuba is an added hurdle :)
"Dominican Republic has the highest number of cases in the Caribbean. A savvy wise traveller would choose Cuba over DR, or Spain.Cuba, 47thDR, 110Spain, 123I didn’t know Spain was in such bad shape.Endcoronavirus.orgBy the way, Cuba is open officially to tourism on the cays."
"Most of the Caribbean countries are open for travel. Turks and Caicos , Barbados , DR, Jamaica, Aruba, etc, etc."
"Gordon #97: All of our international trips were cancelled primarily because it did not seem to be a logical thing to do with the CV situation. Logistics were a factor in my sister's small group's decision to cancel an African interior trip as was a private sailboat charter somewhere in the Med. But I don't think she could identify any specific reason as primary. All my son's family trips were short term casual, so no big deal when it did not make sense for safety reasons. Our trip to Spain was similar. We may make an international trip later this year if hey reopen airports in Cuba but exclude Americans from entry. I will just meet my wife somewhere. But the COVID situation anywhere we go will be a major consideration."
Americans in DR told me they came to gamble and their winnings were not reported to the IRS.

"@ 103 Lori That doesn't exactly ease my concerns about international travel, interesting that some of the flights with infected people are from sun destinations!"
"Thanks Lori. Good point, gator. This is why we have a quarantine law!Though this is also worth highlighting,‘Speaking to CTVNews.ca last month, Air Canada spokesperson Peter Fitzpatrick said that anyone concerned they may have been exposed to the disease should contact their doctor. ""However, it is important to understand the incidence of individuals contracting a communicable disease inflight is very low. As evidence, consider what are called 'cluster outbreaks,' where a group of people contract a disease at the same time and location. These are rarely if ever tied to modes of travel, whereas you often see reports of outbreaks arising from funerals, bars or other gatherings,"" Fitzpatrick said. An Air Canada fact sheet says, ""the reasons for the apparently low rate of in-flight transmission are not fully determined but are thought to include a combination of the lack of face-to-face contact, and the physical barriers provided by seat backs, along with the characteristics of cabin air flow.""Pre-flight screening, temperature monitoring and mandatory face coverings are ""also seen to be effective."""
"Gordon #102: thanks for the list of countries currently closed to the US. My wife and I are generally easy to please people. But, thinking of someplace we could meet in the event Cuba opens it airports but excludes arrival of those from the US (understandably) comes up with a lengthy list of requirements:1) country must have COVID under control2) must not exclude Cubans or US citizens (i.e. rules out US)3) should not require a visa for a Cuban or have a very efficient visa processing facility in Havana.

No question they were going to issue it but it took 8 trips to the Embassy when they decided they needed some new document. 14 hours from her house in Holguin to Havana. 3 trips. She ended up in Havana for 3 weeks doing that. 4) should not be more than 6-8 hour flight from Havana5) destination should be culturally interesting. That rules out all those visa free Caribbean destinations where there is little to do but sit on the beach or in the bar with tourists. So its tough to find some country that meets all those requirements."
"Here's an interesting article about something that could help air travel to Cuba, and around the world also given a bit more time for more testing/research of it.https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/is…Edited: 4:10 pm, August 12, 2020 "
And then there are the dogs that can be trained in days to sniff out COVID with a 94% success rate. https:/…It is good that researchers are seeking out so many options.
"Lets just hope the dogs are trained better than the dogs in Cuba for sniffing out certain "" stuff "".,lol"
SWNova: trainers tell me that a sniffer dog can be trained for only one thing. I suspect that the Cuban dogs are trained for explosives and not recreational products that are not permitted there. .
"Yes it's true that sniffer dogs are only trained to detect one thing. But to just have dogs that are trained for one substance doesn't really make much sense. Kinda opens up your borders for other things. For sure explosives aren't permitted , neither are certain fruits, meats ,veggies, etc. , etc.Edited: 7:03 pm, August 12, 2020 "
And what about the dogs that were supposed to sniff out contraband CUC ?
"Beardo.., that was part of my etc., etc.., : ) CUC, US, Euro, Cad. ., lets just say over the limits of allowable cash."
I have long believed that the most effective things the sniffer dogs did was to convey the impression that they actually did something. They appear successful at that.
"Well Bob, whatever they are trained to sniff out, ( what the substance they use for training purposes ) they are good at detecting that. I watched a trainer and his dog one time, the dog was walking up and down the luggage belt briefly sniffing the luggage, no reaction. I then saw the trainer lift a bag, place something underneath it, let it go, then called the dog back onto the luggage rack when it made it's next go around and he nailed it within seconds. I have no idea what it was, but the dog sure did."
"Yeah, stay at home. You're just choosing the most selfish plan of all and pretending that you are caring for others. The cure for Covid is to live your life to it's fullest. If you get it, so what? It is not even as deadly as seasonal influenza and it is easily cured. Frankly, I can't stand people who are ready to just throw their lives under the bus and allow the fascinestas to tell them how to think, do and act, but if you're already a communist at heart, then this plan should suit you well."
David. Is your comment based on anything or to a particular person.?
@116 what a stupid post
Looks like David is planning to visit Dominica with his Cuban girl friend in mid September:https:/…107618498
"Yes I saw that, what a delightful plan.!!!"
"A week is a long time in politics. At the beginning of August Brits were off to Spain and France. Both countries have had a spike in Corvid 19. So Mallorca put its faith in Germany. Now this country has advised against travel to the Balearic s. Their regional government now admit they made a mistake putting economic s above safety. Mallorca, a beautiful island depends on tourism but admits that is finished until next year."
"According to the Cuban Ministry of Tourism (Mintur) more than 62,000 national tourists have stayed overnight in hotels in Varadero during the first 12 days of August. The largest number of guests stayed at the Tuxpan hotel, of the Cubanacán chain."
I really hope now air canada has cancelled flights to maybe November Cubans should be allowed onto the Cayos till international tourists can return.

"Interesting take on that, SirBarksAlot. Same principal as a simple scarecrow out in the field. You're likely right. Terry"
"@124 Sirbarky I tend to agree with you, we were at the airport in Manzanillo waiting to depart to return to Toronto and had checked our bags in, we headed back outside to the patio bar and on our way the handler was walking the sniffer dog, we were able to pet the dog and play around with it, I thought that was really strange and this made me wonder how serious and effective this program is! Maybe this is normal practice and has nothing to do with how effective the sniffer dog performs its duties, it seemed odd that they would let a working dog mingle with the tourists!"
"Once when we were at the airport (I forget which one), I could hear these dogs barking every once in awhile, right beside where the bags came out. I’d swear it was just a recording, and not real, it would stop and start again....very strange."
"Dog story....Coming out of Chicago on I-94 many yrs ago, 65 mph and another semi passed me, the driver calls me on the C.B.You got a dog in that truck ?Me:...yepThought so, my dog went nuts when I passed ya......He went on to tell me the type of dog he had, some kind of Southern hunting dog.....couldnt believe it, some of them got really good noses."
"Like all dogs, I'm sure their primary interest is sniffing out food. And some wonder what happens to all of the food items that get confiscated. Those little dogs likely eat better than most Cubans. ;-)Terry"
"""My dogs have also been able to tell people that are not right in the head.""At this rate your dogs could become * recluses*Theres not many of us left."
"Hola diva @ 123Re: ""I really hope now air canada has cancelled flights to maybe November Cubans should be allowed onto the Cayos till international tourists can return.""Not clear about your statement - as currently Air Canada has scheduled flights to Santa Clara from October 7th onward - at least out of Toronto - after they recently cancelled some September dates. At least they are still taking bookings for October on their website.It has been posted on this forum on several occasions that international tourists can, in fact, return to the Cayos - and that it has been the case since July 1 - and that the airports (and hotels) were open to receive international tourists destined for the Cayos.Of course it has become very apparent - the differences between ""can"" and ""will"".... Oddly enough, it seems Sunwing has made a bold move, and cancelled their flights/packages from Toronto to CSM until November 1. Air Canada is still taking the ""week-by-week"" approach.... Just curious, but are there no other international flights scheduled other than from Canada to the Cayos? What happened to the Russians????Cheers"
"We have had a few emails today, air canada are not flying to Cuba regardless from Toronto or Montreal till first week of november.That is direct from them."
"Rrrichar, I was wondering that too! Is it just us maybe maybe going to the cayos? Is anybody out there? Are we talking about those adorable cocker spaniels that pose as scary German Shepards? These little guys just want pets more than anything. I thought they were police pets when I first arrived. Ah, cute, I said. Sassy! It’s you! My past adorable not that smart cocker."
Hola divaThat's interesting to know - especially from the point that if you can still make a booking with your credit card for October packages. Very honest company it seems.....book now.....we will take your money - even though we know we will not be operating those flights....but we will be happy to give you a voucher.....because we need the money in hand more than you do.....Didn't Gengen just post something about returning to Canada soon with Air Canada.....hopefully.....Bunch of crooks..... can't trust anyone these days...Cheers
"No voucher for us. Paid in cash getting cash back. Beauty of booking from UK.The flight we were booked on had 2 passenger, so no demand for booking."
"What about those that think they’re going in October....I see a voucher. Speaking of vouchers, yes I’m going there...I think I’m going to try to get a refund....there, that’s my joke for today."
I tied booking from Toronto and air Canada would show me from Montreal instead for cayo Santa Maria and cayo coco
Going by talking with air canada today they basically said not our place to tell you about no flights it is your travel agents job to do that.
rrrichar These crooks are still selling trips starting September the 4th out of Montreal when they know nobody is going to Cayo Coco .This is what happens with the shi## laws we have here in Canada they do whatever they want and nothing we the paying customors can do about these creeps .
"Holaif we offered that service, for any other business , we would be sued and put in jail. Would be interesting to really know how much cash the airline industry is holding ....I would lay odds it is billions . cheers"
I sent it to the person who said that anyone who is traveling now is being selfish. They seem to have everything they want and are trying to stop everyone else from getting anything they need. In my thinking that is the most selfish a person can be. I am trying to get humanitarian aid to my Cuban girlfriend and her two little boys. Nothing is allowed to go in or out of the country except a person with a passport can visit the Caribbean and that is where I will be able to give her the things she needs to stay alive. Anyone who is against that is truly an evil person.
Cry me a river 3 post David.Send her money she can buy what she needs.
"ratwaldo: I have no clue of David and his girlfriend's details but being somewhat in a similar situation, I must comment about the number of things that are currently unavailable at any price in Cuba now. Especially if she does not live in a major city. None of them are life threatening but there are many items that make life more tolerable."
On that point I agree.There have always been shortages in Cuba as we all well know.I cannot imagine that covid has not made it worse.But as you said yourself these items are not life threatening.She may indeed not be able to buy many things she wants but should be able to get by until things improve. In my opinion what is life threatening is the chance you may take covid with you along with the humanitarian aid you wish to take.
Believe me when I say I understand the difficulties many of the Cuban people are going through right now.But these are difficult times.The Canadian government seems to bow down to pressure from the airlines and the airlines could not care even a little bit about you getting the virus.They care only about your money.
"David, you can cargo a package to Cuba. Last week, someone I know in Holguin received a bike from Toronto. 80$ shipping, 30cuc tax on the receiving end."
"What is most troubling reading these comments is the lack of self awareness and grace.Me want trip Me want tripIt is not about you. It is about stopping the spread of elderly killing virus. Cuba has a huge population of elderly.You could cause death?Are you that selfish?Self entitlement is not a privilege it is the sign of a weak soul.One more thing - it is the people whining here who are the first ones crying for a free plane back.Grow up and be patientYou will get your tripEdited: 12:59 pm, August 27, 2020 "
"David is the type we peel of Mt Everest for 200K in taxpayer costs buy boy he had fun.He would also be the first to scream for a free plane to get his sorry butt back to Canada on our dime.You can have your self centred lifestyle soon enough. take selfies in your living room for nowGrow up kidEdited: 1:05 pm, August 27, 2020 "
Me want trip!
"Mtt04 You are entitled to your opinion, but you need to come down off your Perch and open your mind if that’s possible. Guess what, Your Way is not always the Right Way!"
There is no correct answer here.The fact is if you stay at home as much as possible you reduce the risk of getting it or spreading it.That's the simple part.Most of us have to work buy groceries perhaps a doctors appointment.We do not have to indulge ourselves with huge parties and for sure we don't have to consider international for holiday travel till the numbers come down.It is just plain too soon.
Now that’s a nice way to answer. Much easier to understand one’s point of view .That “self awareness and Grace” thing
"Well, you're wrong about everything. Kinda proves you don't read but instead just open your mouth and allow your ignorance to fall out. My trip is for humanitarian aid, something I'm certain you don't have the capacity to understand. I've suffered in the past enough to know what it is to go hungry and to see others turn their backs because they have no love in their souls. Your ignorance is ugly, shameful, and unforgivable. I won't even waste my time correcting your rants, but I will say this much. I don't live in Canada and would never stoop to asking you or others like you for anything, zero, nothing. You are a great void in a black hole of Cynicism. Don't want to know you and wouldn't want to be you."
"David, you have had your rant. Now, do you feel better?"
"WT is that all about. Most of us that are just, as one would say ‘tourists”, have decided it might be best to wait. While others like yourself have ties there and might think differently. We all have our own opinion, we don’t need to put others down that think differently."
"David Mason wrote, “My trip is for humanitarian aid, something I'm certain you don't have the capacity to understand.“Actually, David Mason, you have written several times that you are travelling to bring stuff to your friend. That is not humanitarian aid. That is gifting. If you were indeed concerned about Cubans in need and wanted to contribute, there are a few reputable agencies that you could donate to. But given that you are only concerned about your friend, spending all that money on travel to bring stuff to her does seem like the height of self-indulgence, and certainly has nothing to do with humanitarian aid."
I don't live in Canada has no relevance to this topic at all.What is relevant is that your trip is not for humanitarian aid.People in Cuba are not starving or dying in the streets.What you are doing is taking down supplies to increase the standard of living for someone you care about.As I said earlier just send money that will have to do till things get better.Your rants and personal attacks only serve to destroy your credibility.
You have no idea what you are talking about. You're either an insensitive fool or a liar
You try sending money. It is impossible. I can't believe you are so unschooled and yet attempt to speak with authority.
"David Mason:Might I just point out to you that it appears your replies are directed at one person as I assume you are clicking on the reply button at the bottom of that post. We can only guess to whom your reply is directed, therefore you need to do as I have done and name the person to whom your reply is directed or refer to the post by number which in the case of my reply to you is post 160."
"David Mason, If you could let us know where you are from and where your friend lives in Cuba, several members would be more than helpful in walking you through how you can send money to your friend in Cuba. There might be a few steps involved, but certainly nothing that a bit of patience won’t get you through."
It is impossible to send money to Cuba.This is what you just posted.I am sure many people on here will disagree with you on that.If you can't figure out how to perhaps you are the one that is unschooled.Why not just ask nicely how to do it I am sure someone will help you through the process.

@165 Oh my word. That is some xenophobic hate speech. You sound pretty dangerous to me.
Guess he doesn't want to send money down to his girlfriend and her kids to help them out.David take a deep breath everyone is not out to get you.If you need help to send money it has already been mentioned you can likely get it here.If you just want to rant you can do that as well I just don't see the point.
"David, there are no bad people on this site, you just have to give others a chance to help you with your problem. Also, your post was very racial @165, that is not tolerated here."
Sorry David I was typing when you sent your post asking for assistance.
David Mason:According to your post on the Dominica forum on August 25th it looks like you are meeting her in Dominica so that you 'can give her the supplies that she needs to restart her business and to feed her children'
