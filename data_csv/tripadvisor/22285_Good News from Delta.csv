"I received this email from Delta this morning.DELTA We are extending your flight credits even further We’ve listened, and we know that in these times of rapid change, you want the value of your ticket to be secure and redeemable for a longer period. As a result, we are now extending your eCredit for up to two years.All applicable eCredits will be automatically extended for travel to be completed through May 31, 2022, so there’s no action needed on your part. Delta is working on a solution to display the new expiration dates on Delta.com, so even if your eCredit for canceled travel has not yet been processed or extended, rest assured that your flight value is secure. If you are ready to book your new trip now and don’t yet see your eCredit or have an issue booking via delta.com, please have your old ticket number ready when you call our Reservations team.  Your eCredit can be applied toward a new flight, and in some instances a fare difference will apply. If the new fare is lower, you’ll retain the balance on your eCredit. If the new fare is higher, the difference will be collected.  Have questions or need more information? Please visit our Coronavirus Travel Updates page or Need Help page. Thank you for your continued support.This situation remains fluid, and, like you, we’re continuing to learn more as we go. Please know that we are committing the utmost care and attention into crafting our travel waiver policies. It’s why we’ll continue to evaluate them as the environment changes for you, our employees and our business. Thank you for your continued support as we work through this challenge. Above all, your care and safety is our top priority."
"I've been opting for full refunds instead of credits/vouchers, since I am unsure which airlines may, or may not be in business when we reach the other side of this. In times like these, Cash in hand is King."
"Is American offering cash refund as opposed to flight credits? For my cancelled flight to GC, I’ll be screwed if it’s just credit, especially if it’s only for a year. My wife teaches and my options are limited when she’s able to travel until the summer. Next year she won’t even have a spring break week so the soonest I can travel is June 2021. I had flights cancelled to travel April 13-19 to CG."
"I agree with you Testudo. My cancelled flight was 7 March to California for a two week tennis tournament. It was just when the situation was changing rapidly in the Palm Springs area. I followed the California virus news carefully and cancelled my flight two days before the 7th. On the 10th, the tennis tournament was called off. The tournament offered credit for next year or refunds. I took the refund. An airline refund wasn't an option at that time. We were to be on GC starting 14 April. I had used miles. They were simply put back in our account. I'd rather be packing for GC than having more miles."
"AA is offering cash/credit card refunds for cancelled flights. As an alternative, they will off a voucher/credit for the full value + 20% of the value.Edited: 7:36 pm, April 03, 2020 "
Thank you Testudo for that information I appreciate it!!
"Testudo, where are you seeing the AA option or policy to receive full cash back when cancelling? I'm only seeing cancel for credit, eg, https:/…"
"Check out this article from USA TODAY:Airline cancel your flight due to coronavirus crisis? You're still due a refund, DOT sayshttps:/…"
"l0vethebeach87, thanks for that link. We have June RT flights to Cayman that have changed majorly several times (as I assume they are consolidating less-than-full flights), but as yet have not cancelled outright."
"Here's the extremely easy, not cumbersome in the least, super intuitive way to get a refund on American...1) Go to AA.com2) Locate Receipts and Refunds link at bottom of the page3) On new page, scroll to the Refunds (request or status check) section and click Refunds link at the bottom of the section4) A popup advising ""If your trip was cancelled - Don't worry, the value of your ticket is safe.When you're ready to rebook you'll be able to use the value of your unused ticket and seat purchase toward a future trip.There is no need to request a refund or call reservations right now.""5) Ignore this. There are two links at the bottom of the popup - a button (Go to AA.com) and in much smaller font, a link (Continue to Refunds). Click (Continue to Refunds).6) Now finally on the Refunds page, you'll need to enter the ticket # and last name separately for first ticket holder and submit. You can only request one refund at a time.7) You'll then need to follow these steps for each additional tickets holder.They make it so simple, don't they?"
"Also, if any airline changes your flight times by over 60 minutes, you’re entitled to a full refund. This happened to me for my Aruba flight that was in June. They moved my flight by more than an hour and I just called them and they fully refunded my ticket. Keep that in mind too. Thank you also for sharing how to get a refund online at aa.com. That’s very helpful gonna do that today."
"Thanks again Testudo, I just went to aa.com and requested a refund for my flights, which it said were eligible for a refund so those instructions made it VERY simple. I’m pretty relieved that between my VRBO and flights I’m not out a dollar for this cancelled trip. I rescheduled for August 8-15, simply because my VRBO owner said I could use the condo any available week either this year or next year and gave me a free extra night. My wife is a teacher and August 8-15 would be the last week of summer we could travel. I don’t anticipate we will be able to go then either but again, nothing lost I can still use it anytime next year without penalty. Sure wish that week in August worked, I can get two round trip flights to GC for $600! My flights previously were $1300 for two. I just think booking flights at this point is too hopeful."
Our premier just said in the currently ongoing press conference that it “could” be year end before our hotels may reopen and there is a way to test potential visitors. Those looking to rebook should perhaps hold off a bit. You can watch the press conference on gov.ky or their FB page or that of the Cayman Compass.
"Yes, there is just too much uncertainty with both the current crisis and what will come in the future. Standards for travel are going to radically change and it is going to take time to decide upon new protocols and then determine exactly how those standards will be implemented. Being a small place and also an island, Cayman is likely to work all of these things out and manage before other places can. The US DOT was very explicit today that all airlines operating flights from here that have been cancelled MUST give refunds for all cancelled flights. It was apparent they were trying to hang onto as much cash possible by making refunds very difficult while making rebooking fairly easy."
"Testudo, thanks. I believe this link may take people directly to that cancellation page for AA. https://prefunds.aa.com/refunds/Edited: 8:39 am, April 05, 2020 "
