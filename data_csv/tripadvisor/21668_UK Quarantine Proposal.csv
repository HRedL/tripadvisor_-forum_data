BBC is reporting the UK Gov is considering introducing a 14 day quarantine requirement for arriving air passengers from the end of this month - only 3 months too late.
"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52594023.Logged in to post about it -- Madness, the horse has been & gone long ago, world tour almost complete.I guess we're preparing early for the sequal."
Never mind this should have been introduced some months ago why is it taking a further 3 weeks before it is introduced - if I recall correctly the USA shut it’s borders to most passengers from the EU/UK with around 48 hours notice
"Money !! -- just as Lewis said, cash is king. Some of the quotes in the article, if true, are simply incomprehensable. >>UK airports suggested that a quarantine ""would not only have a devastating impact on the UK aviation industry, but also on the wider economy"".<< Protesting?>>Karen Dee from the Airport Operators Association, which represents most UK airports, said the measure should be applied ""on a selective basis following the science"" and ""the economic impact on key sectors should be mitigated""<< also protesting . . . and expecting exceptions?"
"Not only has this come months too late (horse, stable door)... but It seems rather pointless having a quarantine requirement for passengers arriving from countries where infection rates are considerably lower than in the UK, with new infections down to nearly zero in some cases."
"Also, is it likely to affect UK residents returning home?Looks like it.Edited: 7:01 pm, May 08, 2020 "
It was reported in the travel press a couple of days ago. Willie Walsh has said if its introduced BA will fly 'very little.
Yet another case of sheer incompetence from the Home Office.
...only 3 months too late.+1.
"Last Saturday, the Health Minister announced it also in France, but on Sunday the French President contradicted him and stated it did not apply to the EU, Schengen and the UK. If the UK decides a quarantine for people coming from EU countries, France and other EU countries might well retaliate."
"And why exception for Ireland, should be all, or nobody. And hardly enforceable."
Too little too late.
"""And why exception for Ireland, should be all, or nobody. And hardly enforceable.""The exception for Ireland would be exactly because it isn't enforceable. There is an open land border 300 miles long between the Irish Republic and the UK. Even in the days when the UK had tens of thousands of heavily armed troops on full alert in Northern Ireland they couldn't stop people they were actively looking for from crossing the border."
"It would be politicaly insensitive to treat Northern Ireland any different to other parts of the UK, but if the quarantine is to work, then at least people travelling from the Republic or Northern Ireland should have their documents checked to establish nationality, otherwise anyone wishing to avoid the restriction could opt for connections via any Irish (be it the republic or the north) airports to arrive to the mainland UK."
"Per Business Traveller, there will be exceptions for foreign lorry drivers and essential workers....so define essential workers."
">>Also, is it likely to affect UK residents returning home?<<Yip, looks like it to me. Though from a selfish perspective, that wouldn't be an issue for the 'retired' [grins]Unfortunately, I'm not sure we'll be going anywhere to return from and, having slept on the news, there is an outside chance this is 'retalitory'. From a BBC article 3 days ago. https:/…world-europe-52547403>>Greek Tourism Minister Haris Theocharis has told the BBC his country plans to open up gradually to visitors. ""Travelling by road will be safer initially than flying and we'll see that kind of tourists earlier,"" he said. <<That 'statement' when originally published specifically excluded the UK by name and has been re-written. It included a passage referring to safe countries with 'Covid under control' & 'limited risk to Greeks' and figures 'as good as Greece's or better' only. Italy said similar, but no names. Germany will consider area's & islands nationals may visit, depending on 'performance' at destination.As they will all be operating on reduced capacity, it's a great opportunity to 'pick n choose' who you let in. And block out the rowdy, boozy, Brits abroad brigade. We might not be travelling for a while."
"Unless I'm reading this incorrectly, it is flights & not nationalities that are effected. I would be surprised if there were not usually other nationalities, other than Irish or UK, on flights from Belfast to the rest of the UK. Also, many people from N Ireland use Dublin airport to get to destinations in the UK not served from either Belfast airport or from Derry.I'm probably wrong, usually am, but maybe the common travel area is the reason for exempting flights from here."
"The Greek Minister proposes mandatory testing rather than a quarantine, but right now it is unrealistic as those tests are not available on demand in many countries and they could cost as much as the airfare."
"You would think that being an island, or group of islands, the UK was the obvious country which should have been able to contain the virus by applying quarantine restrictions on people arriving here once the outbreak was declared. We are now likely to pay the price. We are now officially the third sickest nation in the world, and our death rate per million of the population is dreadful. Austria, land-locked and hosting one of the original hotspots, has been a model example in controlling the virus. We are not in the Schengen area, will shortly exit the EU and will be barred from travellling almost anywhere without a health certificate and/ or fourteen days quarantine on arrival. The tourist industry on which many people rely for their jobs and income is effectively dead, at least until next year. No -one will travel if they face the prospect of quarantine for fourteen days on arrival, and again when they return home.The government has relied on mathematical modelling in spite of it having proved unreliable in the past, and spent money on the Nightingale hospitals while not adequately equipping the frontline staff in hospitals, care homes and the transport system. Even our prime minister proved unable to grasp the concept of avoiding contact and maintaining social distancing. The behaviour of Neil Ferguson who thought he was “safe “ as he’d previously tested positive and had immunity just proves that statisticians don’t understand biology!The principle of prevention being better than cure has been totally ignored. There are now suggestions that the virus was present in many countries before the Chinese admitted they had a problem. Failure to observe basic precautions means we may well have a degree of herd immunity but we have also allowed the outbreak to get out of control and wrecked the world economy. We are lucky it wasn’t Ebola ..... we were woefully ill prepared."
"I just read Sky's latest on this & they are saying ports also which I don't think the BBC report mentioned.Back to Rep/N Ireland, again, many travellers from N Ireland use the ferry from Dublin to Holyhead"
"but if the quarantine is to work, then at least people travelling from the Republic or Northern Ireland should have their documents checked to establish nationality--Tilly, I'd like to tell you about the Troubles. I lived through them, I don't want them back."
"Ooops, meant to post the link to the Sky News report…sky.com/story/coronavirus-uk-arrivals-face-…"
"The Scottish Government has been asking to implement quarantine since the beging of the lock down, but the UK government has refuse and this is not a devolved issue so Scotland could not implement it themselves, WHY? 100's of flights have been landing in the UK since the lock down with no checks taking place of the passengers or their medical state. The whole UK government handling the situation is a farce."
"A quarantine requires a computer filing system plus a control of each person, that means resources.In Belgium, there is just a 'voluntary' quarantine, no control at all."
This was the main news headline here 2 days ago.https://www.newstalk.com/news/laws-quarantin…
"Tourism is worth about £100 billion a year to the UK economy, some of this is obviously homegrown, but aloft of it is because people fly or travel to the UK.  The airline industry employs tens of thousands directly or indirectly through supply chains...so whilst the eco- warriors are cheerfully hoping for the demise of all air travel, the economic and social costs ( plus the mental health after shocks) of this will dwarf CV. So I guess the question is how much economic and social destruction is BoJo prepared to inflict on this country?? I get restrictions on places where it's bad, and other countries but this is utterly mad."
"I get restrictions on places where it's bad, and other countries but this is utterly mad. - You don't consider over 30,000 reported deaths due to covid 19 (the true number is probably higher) to be bad, it's the highest in Europe.How many of those deaths are attributable to the fact that we never imposed any form of entry restrictions unlike other countries will never be known."
"Entry restrictions have an effect on infections, but not on how many of those infected die.Germany - 170k infections, 7k deathsUK - 212k infections, 31k deaths"
AviatrixI understand the point you are trying to make but before I blindly accept reported infection and death statistics it’s essential to know that It’s a proper like for like comparison.
"In times where containing and reducing spread is king, I am not surprised this is Boris's latest idea - but as others said "" it is a bit too late"" . We had people arriving from those Covid.19 cruise ships quarantined for several weeks initially ,and then it all went quiet and anyone and everyone was allowed to walk in and wander around without restriction! .I am quite happy with the idea of people needing to be quarantined on entering or returning to the UK from aboard whist the pandemic is being brought under control, but it is an emergency measure and as such needs to be imposed for a specified period - it cannot be a ""forever"" rule."
"I just can’t get my head round why you would put this in place at beginning of June when we should be easing restrictions, I’d support some kind of screening process if that’s possible, but I’m also a believer that the world will help it’s self ease lockdown if you let them, I think that obviously politicians are nervous of opening up their country to a virus but...... too late , it’s now about living with it, travellers will take precautions, some people will not want to travel, hotels etc will do everything they can to keep people safe, if we are left to it I think the world travellers can get the world travelling again safely"
"The Government was advised in March by the expert scientific and medical bods that quarantining at airports was a futile exercise....the virus was already rampant within the community so anybody entering the country with it was hardly going to make a difference. The only benefit would be if contact tracing was introduced and at that time the capability to test in sufficient numbers to facilitate track and trace wasn’t in place. Thermal temperature checks are a token effort anyway, a lot of people carrying the virus don’t develop a high temperature and most who do have been found to be suffering from a common cold or flu, not the virus. So it’s taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The Government aren’t just making decisions off the top of their heads they are being guided at all times by a team of scientific and medical people. It’s been suggested the lockdown was late but the reasoning behind that was because if applied too early the public would grow restless and flaunt the rules when the virus was still rampant...we are seeing that happening now.Edited: 9:50 am, May 09, 2020 "
"""The Government aren’t just making decisions off the top of their heads they are being guided at all times by a team of scientific and medical people. "" - One of which was of course Prof Neil Ferguson whose advice was central to the whole lockdown strategy, the same Prof Ferguson who had to resign for breaking the social distancing rules he was instrumental in formulating in that a woman he was said to be in a relationship with visited his home in lockdown.His excuse was ""I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms.""Sounds like we need better experts"
"The government ""scientific"" and medical advisors seem to have been making it up as they go along. Jenny Harries has been caught out contradicting herself more than once. The ""lockdown"" isn't a lockdown. They should have locked down properly and strictly enforced it like in Spain with some hefty fines for breaching it, not just some piffling £60 reduced to £30 if paid with x days. No deterrent whatsoever. Typical of the government though, leave the people to make the decision, that way the government can blame ""us"" for it when it goes pear shaped."
"<< His excuse was ""I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms.""Sounds like we need better experts >>It most certainly does. Even though he's had it it is by no means certain he would be immune."
So many comments with no idea that the virus could never be stopped. Even if by some miracle we shut down months ago and had few cases what would we do next keep everyone out for ever because virus don’t go away they last for a eternity. A vaccine is very unlikely and only 1 vaccine in human history actually stopped a virus smallpox but the vaccine was invented in 1756 and took until 1977 to be completely eradicated. A HIV vaccine was said to be months away after millions spent but 30 years later we don’t have one Just remember when any lockdown restrictions are lifted it’s just because we have space in ICU no other reason and in countries where the lockdown was stricter they have had to close things or lockdown again. We did the right thing it got to spread without overwhelming the NHS and hopefully will continue to do so. Yes our deaths our high in a densely populated area was always going to happen but in deaths per million we are lower than Italy Spain etc. Heard immunity is still the only way at the moment to control this but it’s not said anymore as people don’t like it.
"NZ and Australia shut down their borders almost immediately,, and enforced people arriving to go into quarantine into hotels and hostels which had been taken over for that purpose, or at home if they were returning residents (and the police checked on them). Both are countries which rely on tourism in a big way, but their strategy seems to have worked better than ours.They shut their state borders too in Australia and the number of cases and deaths has been very few.I cannot understand why our government didn't look at their model of preventing the spread of the virus. They should have implemented this months ago.If you're not a resident in Australia and have to be quarantined, it will cost you AUD$2500 about £1250.Edited: 11:30 am, May 09, 2020 "
"<< and in countries where the lockdown was stricter they have had to close things or lockdown again. >>Out of all the many countries that had stricter lockdowns which are having to do that? << Heard immunity is still the only way at the moment to control this but it’s not said anymore as people don’t like it. >>Really? There's no evidence yet that having recovered from C19 gives you immunity, and if it does how long it lasts.This virus isn't going to magically disappear but we should do all we can to contain it. Testing, more testing, tracking, tracing and isolating."
No all they did was slow it they haven’t stopped anything
"Robert, who was your comment aimed at?"
"""Only one vaccine in human history ever stopped a virus "" Not quite ..... polio, hepatitis A, hepatitis B , yellow fever, and that's just for starters. Smallpox has been effectively eradicated but there are still viable samples held in research institutes. Polio has certainly been contained but resistance to vaccination by some populations has limited it's uptake and consequently outbreaks continue to appear from time to time. Hep B vaccine is compulsory in many health care settings and those of us who have remained healthy and allowed to work have reason to be grateful.The first vaccine in 1796 was effective against cowpox, a different virus, but as luck would have it, it also conferred a degree of protection against smallpox. The present day smallpox vaccine was developed in the 1950's and has been remarkably successful."

I know immunity isn’t proven yet but nobody has had it twice the reports that suggest people had turned out to be depleted virus in noses.My wife has been in hospital seriously ill with covid my daughter was very ill as well both work in the NHS (both ok now) so I don’t take this lightly but I can not see any option any time soon other than let’s get in with it and hopefully keep the hospital empty enough to cope.Edited: 4:14 pm, May 09, 2020 "
"#44 There is an important difference between stopping a virus and eradicating it. Polio could potentially be eradicated, but the vaccine is not available to all potential sufferers. For practical purposes it has been eradicated in many countries, but not all. For the current pandemic, a vaccine is unlikely to arrive any time soon, so we are too late to stop it and can only hope to contain it by breaking the chain of infection. Whether the populations of all the affected countries have the will to comply with lockdown, and the basic hygiene requirements or access to hand washing etc will determine how long it lasts and how far it spreads"
">>>Really? There's no evidence yet that having recovered from C19 gives you immunity, and if it does how long it lasts. <<<============A study by Columbia University in New York on the New York epidemic published recently suggests otherwise, with results from 1,343 people in and around New York City, The lead acedemic is “It really shows that most people do develop antibodies, and that there’s very good correlation between those antibodies and their capability to neutralise virus,” Furthermore, the NHS is using convalescent plasma transfusions from those that have recovered from the virus to treat those suffering from it. I don't believe the NHS would be undertaking this therapy if there was no evidence that the body does not develop a degree of immunity.The reason for the caution is related to the lack of a currently reliable antibody test. As to how long one becomes immune from another study is suggesting this maybe be related to the severity of symptons an indivdual suffered in the 1st place.Edited: 6:20 am, May 10, 2020 "

"'A vaccine is very unlikely' Not true; work on treatment and a vaccine is moving along at remarkable speed. 'and only 1 vaccine in human history actually stopped a virus' Also not true. 'A HIV vaccine was said to be months away after millions spent but 30 years later we don’t have one' The lack of a vaccine for HIV is secondary as there are antiretrovirals which have proven very effective for reducing or eliminating viral load.Whether cell-mediated immunity or humoral immunity, we're still learning about the response to this coronavirus with the lack of valid testing limiting the results available so far. If a person's immune system and supportive care have been enough such that they've recovered it's likely they'll have immunity to the virus but demonstrating it and quantifying it have been difficult.In the short term antiviral therapy or plasma therapy (neither of which should be discounted) may be helpful in treatment and as such why not continue work on both options.Given the very short timeline quite a lot has been accomplished in three months. Attempts to quarantine now when the virus is endemic world wide may be part of the longer term solution but it's only a very small factor at this point."
Boris Johnson talked tonight about the persons who enter by air.So it wouldn't apply to those who arrive by land or by sea ?
"So it wouldn't apply to those who arrive by land or by sea ? - No mention of any quarantine for other than air arrivalsIt also excludes those arriving from France, probably because of the Channel tunnel. ""Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron have issued a joint statement saying quarantine measures would not apply between France and the UK ""at this stage"".https:/…world-52601754"
<< As for other points Spain just extended its state of emergency >>The measures that are in place can only legally be enforced during a state of alarm. It had nothing to do with the easing measures that had already taken place. Infections continue to fall.
"It seems it does not apply to people arriving from Ireland either, even by plane.I guess it wouldn't apply to the Eurostar passengers from Belgium either, as this train crosses France.

">>> It's nothing more than a trial at this stage, not a widely available treatment <<<======That article is nearly a month old and events have moved on. That said the treatment itself for other viruses is well practiced and stretches back many decades. In the case of CV19, it is only used serious cases at the moment."
Would it be cynical to suggest that the UK Government relaxes FCO guidance about foreign travel whilst imposing quarantine on return to the UK?This action would allow tour operators and airlines to fly(so long as foreign govts allow entry) but would stop refunds because people couldn't afford to stay home for 14 days upon return. Just wondering.
MartyIf you are certain that plasma is being widely used as a treatment please provide some independent link or details to support that statement

"Leaving aside treatments, vaccines and antibodies for a moment, I have to say that I have no more understanding for the details of the quarantining policy now than I did at the same time yesterday.We'd already decided not to travel internationally this year, so it doesn't matter too much for us, but I can't help being curious as to how it would all work at whatever point it might start."
"#58 Lucky old you Jock ;-) Inspired choice indeed. I'd think it'll still be difficult to get there and anywhere else. Pity the overnight buses won't be running from Edinburgh :-)My own circumstances would allow me to go since I work from home and my wife is a key worker. Not sure that the NHS would be happy though with no need to quarantine on return.It'll need a lot more clarity from the UK Govt before anyone can make informed travel decisions (including airlines, tour operators and the travelling public)."
"My flight's booked n paid for M8, I took advantage of EZY's 99p bags. I also 'gambled' that France would definitely want the Riviera open for August, Mega money month, so I slipped in for 1st wk Sept. It was by far the best chance I had for success. I have - IMO- more chance of making France than the North of Scotland, that's how I see it panning out this year."
From what I gather the exemption has to be extended to the other EU member states as well as France. That's how EU law works. We are still bound by this until the end of the year so what ever rights are given to the French technically have to be give to us as well. Can only see this working for those countries outside of the EU and really should only apply to high risk areas such as the USA. To introduce it now after letting those off cruise ships full of the virus with no control on their movements would be crazy. Looks like policy written on the back of a fag packet with no serious thought on its legality or the affect it will have on the airlines. Boris wants to stimulate the economy again but this is one way of putting thousands more out of work by forcing airlines in bankruptcy as no one will want to travel if they have to spend 14 days in quarantine. .
That's how EU law works. - You would think so but there are plenty of examples of EU Governments ignoring EU law in the current situation e.g. Germany closed it's borders in March despite EU lawhttps:/…world-europe-51905129
"Gov have published the guidance, 14:00, details are emerging on the Live pagehttps:/…world-52612438Re 41 . . the quarantine is confirmed . . . >>The government will also introduce a quarantine system for international arrivals, starting as soon as possible. // Most people arriving will be asked to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival to the UK. This does not apply to France or the common travel area however. <<"
If this is only applies to France and not the other EU nations what is the chance of a refund on my air ticket? We will know detail tonight but it looks like Greece is not going to happen this year. The quarantine makes it impractical for those that are working. This is the kiss of death for the travel industry as many will not survive the year and uncertainty about it being in place will mean that people won't be booking trips abroad.
#64....I see no start date and no list of exemptions. Apart from that it’s totally clear! Further details awaited.
"""Most people arriving will be asked to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival to the UK""Most people & asked to, sounds like not a lot of clear thought has gone in to this."
"It's a British thing, what do we mean, ask means really an order in this instance:) when it becomes clear"
"The guidance says that the quarantine will come into place at some time after 13th May, no specific date set as yet."
I dont think this is coming in yet and if you throw the idea out there early you will get opinions and suggestions and problems before you do it so less complaints after It will kill off holiday travel all together this year Think some people had ideas of late summer sun but that very unikely now Have cancelled 2 holidays already and about to cancel another one ! But as long as we dont catch the virus a price worth paying
I smell furious backtracking in the air.
And a point about insurance.British nationals might have holidays booked for later this year which could well operate. But if on return home they had to quarantine for 14 days they might not be able to travel because of needing to resume their employment. So if they cancel because of that would their insurance pay out.....unlikely?
I asked that question a bit earlier in the thread Bill. I think it'll come down to whether the FCO changes it's advice. If they don't it's unlikely that tour operators and airlines will recommence operations in a meaningful way.If they do that'll put the cat amongst the pigeons and leave many travellers at the mercy of their insurance companies and the chances of a successful claim will be slim.
"No idea KhunBill.I’m expecting to be working from home for most of this year. If self isolation in your own home was permitted I could manage that. What would happen though if you enter at another citykn the U.K. and have a domestic connection? Would you have to do the 2 weeks quarantine before ta,ing the domestic flight home? What if you have an hours journey by train to get home?There needs to be a .ot more details of how this will work in practise and how it will be enforced."
"there are plenty of examples of EU Governments ignoring EU law in the current situation e.g. Germany closed it's borders in March despite EU law--Tom, that's written into the Schengen treaty. Member states can suspend its operation in whole or in part for various reasons including national security and public health. Several states suspended it for land crossings during the 2014 migrant crisis."
"darrenmccThanks for the correction - I wasn't aware of that. Another example of state sanctioned disregard of EU law isThe Dutch Gov sanctioning the use of vouchers by KLM when EU261 clearly states the passenger is legally entitled to a refund, a voucher is not a refund and I know all airlines have cash flow issues but that does not give them a free pass to ignore the law or to assume their passengers are happy to give them an interest free loan."
This article in The Independent gives a bit more detail https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-an…
You announce a quarantine on arriving air passengers with no start dateWithin 24 hours you announce that arrivals from France are exempt and extend the measures to other forms of arrivalThis sounds like making up an important policy for both UK residents and visitors on the back of a fag packet as they say - it would be funny if it wasn't so awful.
"Are all arrivals from France exempt or just French citizens ? Or maybe they don't know yet !I think the interior borders within Schengen will open again soon , so there is not way that the EU will allow that plan. Otherwise Brits can head all over Europe through France and back but other countries citizens are basically blocked"
"I don’t understand if they are planning on starting a self quarantine to help lessen the spread, why are they waiting nearly three weeks to implement it? Australia started it with no notice....at midnight on the day it was announced. (Initially self quarantine at home, later at a hotel of the government”s choice). Why the wait?"

Presumably someone then quickly questioned why just by Air. It then changes to acknowledge (by sea/by rail) and restrict all arrival means. What a very poorly structured decision, one “on notice” to introduce at some point, far too late.

It is often difficult to tell which side of the border you are on, except by road markings being in a different style. Because the border followed existing local county boundaries when it was set up, rather than being designed as a defensible/enforceable border, there are all sorts of anomalies, such as farms which straddle the border and even buildings which straddle the border. There is nothing to stop anyone who is one side of the border from crossing to the other by car, bus, train, or on foot. Indeed people may live one side and work on the other.Quite apart from the entirely correct points that Ireland and the UK are members of a Common Travel Area which allows citizens of either to cross to the other, restrictions are literally unenforcable, so why pretend that they could be enforced?Edited: 5:42 am, May 12, 2020 "
"Totally off topic but just to add to Andy's post. One of my school teachers lived on the border, at Belleek. He cooked in the Rep of Ireland as the kitchen was located on the southern side of the border. He went to the toilet in N Ireland. That scenario is a very common one along the border. Also, there is a misconception about Ulster/ N Ireland. Ulster is one of 4 provinces on the island & is made up of 9 counties. Northern Ireland consists of Counties Down, Antrim, Armagh, Derry, Fermanagh & Tyrone. The other 3 counties are part of the Rep of Ireland- Cavan, Monaghan & my own county, Donegal.There is only one operational train line that crosses the border, the Dublin - Belfast line, no others."
"Lots of confusion around but this statement from Matt Hancock takes the biscuit. Asked if ""summer was cancelled"", he told ITV's This Morning: ""That's likely to be the case.”Nothing like a bit of clarity ;-)"
Until he slips to France for his own summer holiday. Everything that now that comes out of his mouth I treat with contempt since the mess made with both PPE and testing.

You got to love a well thought plan from the UK Gov ahead of the public announcement of it's introduction at a date to be determined (or is that never)
">>>You got to love a well thought plan <<<I do, but I've given up hope."
Is there a special qualification for the level of incompetence being shown by the government or can anyone without a clue join in?

France said they would give us an exemption so we we then had to agree to the same for them France probably told by EU they cant so all change again !
"#103 We can only speculate as those discussions between heads of state and ministers are kept secret.It seems that Italy will announce they fully open their borders inside the EU on June 3. Is it the sign of a EU agreement ? Or, on the contrary, does Italy put pressure on France, Spain, ...?"
"Germany relaxed its western land borders yesterday. Closing/opening the national border is a Member State competency, but the external Schengen border is an EU competency."

As per update in post #98
Air Passenger quarantine plan makes no sense says UK Govt advisor https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/1…
It would have made sense if it had been introduced alongside the UK lockdown measures or earlier but the benefits from it's introduction now will be limited.I'm guessing there will be no policing of any quarantine meaning you are reliant on people being honest and respectful of the process - good luck with that.
"The UK government seems to be relying on people being sensible and co-operative. Unfortunately, some in this country have no common sense at all. I would hope that visitors are better served in that department.Sadly, not much of what the UK government has said recently makes much sense to me, and the quarantine idea is no exception."
">>you are reliant on people being honest and respectful<<Like this guy? https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highl… -- a prime example of your point pops up on request Tom, New Zealand to the Isle of Skye via LAX & BA to London, then drives the rest unopposed to visit his 2nd home.Why are we all in lockdown? seriously? the next time you go to the shops he, or any of the thousands like him, could well be the one in front of you in the queue. It's reduced this farce to a completely futile gesture and history may well show only Brazil got it right."
"You cannot base an overall policy on a very small number of exceptional cases. Some people cross the Belgian borders in a clandestine way as well, but that's just a handful of people, to go to such extreme actions they have a very strong motivation (generally reunion with family or lover)."
"""It's reduced this farce to a completely futile gesture ""Clearly not as countries in lockdown (including the UK) have succeeded bringing down the mortality rate, in many cases quite substantially."

"Thanks Jock. As one door opens another one closes (France) :-((I can't see it being as simple as that however.Edited: 6:21 pm, May 18, 2020 "
I'm keeping a close eye on this thread. I am a Brit who needs to move back to the UK in order to start a job. Been waiting for weeks for any details of this quarantine scheme - am happy to comply by the rules but would like to know what they are. Not all of us have cars to whisk us off to private homes where we can self isolate properly.
"I don't think it will be workable, but perhaps there is an element of hope involved. I mean that the government hopes that most will comply but knows that there will always be those like Gaiman who just do whatever they want anyway.That seems to have been the case with the lockdown, where I read somewhere that the government expected fewer would comply."
"#118....no rules yet, nothing in place. If you need to return to the UK then do so now."
"According to Grant Shapps ""The final details of the quarantine scheme will be released soon and come in early next month."" It may be that they create ""air bridges"" between the UK and other countries which could possibly give quarantine free travel, dependent on the R number of those countries. It would be reviewed every 3 weeks."
"In France, following a decree of the the Constitutional Court, the quarantine for non EU travellers will be 'voluntary'."
A voluntary quarantine is a contradiction
In Belgium we also have since March a 'voluntary ' quarantine of 14 days. That means there isn't any list of the persons in quarantine neither any control.
Impossible to have compulsory quarantine Say 50000 people fly in a day how do you police that and multiply that by a 2 week period and Im sure that is a low estimate of normal travel
There is a difference between a mandatory quarantine where you tell people they have to quarantine themselves and a voluntary quarantine where you tell people they can decide themselves whether to quarantine or not.Policing or enforcing a quarantine is a separate issue entirely
"All right, in Belgium we have a mandatory quarantine which is not enforced nor controlled."
"Detail update due today - https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52765054Details of the quarantine expected to be announced at todays briefing. Arrivals will be required to provide an address or the Gov will arrange accommodation, fines up to £1000, and spot compliance checks by health officials."
Hopefully the Govt will also publish the scientific advice behind this decision. Wouldn't hold my breath though.
Chances of publishing the scientific advice - close to zero
Surely would make more sense quarantining those from countries with high infection rates rather than those that have it under control? Aviation gonna be even more screwed for another few months!!
"It all seems like a triumph of hope over reality to me. How many spot checks will they actually do? How many of these fines will ever be issued to those who don't comply? What does 'up to' actually mean?I also can't see how a quarantine can be voluntary. If it is, then there's zero point in having one."
There is also talk of being fined if passengers don't quarantine themselves. I doubt if we enough police to enforce this.
I doubt if we enough police to enforce this. - I read somewhere it was going to be health care staffIn all probability the number of checks will be very low but you publish the fact that spot checks will be made and fines up to £1000 as a way of deterring those prepared to break quarantine.Lets wait and see what they do announce but what cannot change is the fact that this should have been done several weeks ago.
"Like Australia and NZ did, right from the start. Whether that has helped keep their numbers very low we can't really tell, but it certainly looks like it."
Being reported that sources with Virgin Atlantic are saying if the UK introduces the quarantine that Virgin will not operate any flights until August at the earliest - that could of course just be a convenient excuse.https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-cor…
Apparently the G7 is due to meet in the US on June 10th. Will that mean the UK Prime Minister and other UK officials need to quarantine for 14 days or face fines up to £1000? ;-)
I hope they tell the fool who is inviting them that they don't want to take the risk of traveling to this country then
">>> There is also talk of being fined if passengers don't quarantine themselves. I doubt if we enough police to enforce this. <<<======The police are not going to enforce this, it looks like it will fall at the feet of the Dept of Environmental Health."
"And I'm not sure they will be able to do a good job either...I've a feeling that quarantine rules will be knocked on the head. But how daft to announce a plan, but have no intention of putting into practice for three weeks and now, will all the objections, it could fall on the first hurdle...."
"It strikes me as an expensive idea, both financially and socially, that will do little to bring down the number of infections. It basically means to business or tourist traffic into the UK and will be a nuisance to people who have been looking to reunite with family living abroad as lockdown restrictions are easing across Europe. There probably was a time where certain quarantine measures would have made sense but introducing it at this stage of the game just seems bizarre."
"Generally, mainland US airports have been described by arriving US passengers as not doing a good job of either screening or following up with passengers.However, the state of Hawaii takes it very seriously. They have a quarantine covering everyone arriving from anywhere outside Hawaii and if they think an arriving passenger doesn't look to have the resources to sustain a 14 day quarantine they buy the person a one-way ticket back to his or her origin."
Priti Patel is briefing the country as I type this. It doesn't sound convincing to me. She's started talking about spot checks and penalties now.
"""Those from overseas who refuse to comply may be refused entry"".What about those who get caught by the spot checks? Will they be removed? What if they are UK residents?"
Details at teh bottom of this article - https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52774854To be reviewed every 3 weeks . . . should be all forgotten by Sept ;-))
"So strange, UK will be starting those measures just at the time when EU countries negotiate removing their restrictions (although these negotiations are difficult)."
Not that strange. They're always late to the party!
"The government has done lots of stupid things with Covid-19, but this strikes me as one of the most stupid and pointless of them all.I would have been in favour of have selective quarantine measures for people arriving from certain Coronavirus epicentres such as the USA and Brazil... but there are countries in Europe where new daily infection rates are in double or even single figures, what on earth is the point in quarantining people from those countries? They should be quarantining us, but not the other way round."
Well that was a complete waste of time. The lunatics have finally taken over the asylum!!
Crazy and way too late!
Gets even crazier. Medical professionals coming to the UK to fight the virus are exempt but my wife who's a nurse would need to quarantine on return from holiday!!
"The proposal is so brain dead it's incredible, and that's what a Tory supporter thinks."
"What holiday? -- if they don't lift the FCO advice you'll not be able to go anywhere anyway, It seems to me we only got half the story. It's worse than getting half a haircut.If we are to quarantine on return from June the 8th . . . where is it we are returning from?"

"He can't come for 2 days . . . it would have to be 16, that's my understanding. You're not even allowed to the shops"
"#155 He would have to enter the UK 16 days before the meeting , quarantine for 14 days and then attend the meeting and go back to Germany. This quarantine rule could be a temporary thing or maybe with us for a year , who knows , really can't see many people wanting to fly anywhere so maybe only small numbers involved . France is urging all it's people to holiday within the country and boost the French economy , maybe all countries will go down this route for the next year or two."

"To have had any meaningful effect a measure like this should have been put in place not 8 weeks ago but 10 to 12 weeks ago.There is always going to be a point when the cure was going to be worse disease, this measure takes it dangerously close to that tipping point - I can see it being the last straw for quite a few established businesses. It is an ill thought out measure on so many levels, now is the time for clarity of thought with adept fleet of foot discriminate thinking and action.

Agreed and have read similar thoughts elsewhere. Much too late and she now has to face a backbench revolt and opposition from Grant Shapps as it has made the work of his department very difficult. Cannot help thinking that the virus is being used as a smoke screen for new immigration legislation which she is currently putting through parliament. The current situation is too much of a golden opportunity to pull up the draw bridge to keep those nasty foreigners out. Typical of the woman is as hard line as they come and has the audacity to claim it was what was promised in the manifesto to control immigration. Did I miss something or was quarantine part of it to bring immigration to the hallowed figure of 0. She won't last - she never does. The backlash both home and in Europe will see the end of her. There are a few more that need to go as well for the total mismanagement of our response to the crisis.

"Re my post # 186, I was too late to edit but I meant to finish by saying....without having to quarantine in the ROI."
It is not clear how this will affect landside transit passengers. I am a British citizen travelling to Heathrow on 17th June. I then need to catch another flight to Bulgaria 2 hours later from the same terminal but it's nota connecting flight. These are 2 separate tickets. I have to pass border control to collect my bags and then go to catch another flight. So I am considered a landside transit passenger. Will I be quarantined?
I don't think anyone knows yet. Based on what I've read so far the answer would be yes as you need to provide a UK address when clearing immigration but the details of the policy haven't been made clear.
But what if I show them that I will be catching another flight on the same day? It's crazy that they haven't clarified this
"Yiu can show that, but it wouldn’t stop you from leaving the airport and staying, so they won’t likely accept it"
That's true. I could just give them an address and still catch my flight. What happens if they don't find me there at all?
I thought I read about a substantial fine in this thread
If you are found to have not complied with quarantine rules you face a fine of up to £1000
Well a hotel in UK for 14 days will cost me more than the fine lol
Then I think your option is clear
Can they prosecute me ? I really don't want to break the rules but ultimately I don't have an address to give them. I will give them the address in Bulgaria
"Iveta, even in normal times two hours isn't enough to make a landside transit. I think the only chance you have of making your onward flight is by not checking any luggage and making an airside transit. And that's what I would do.(And I bet the UK government hasn't even stopped to think about transit passengers, and the need for some transit passengers to have to go through Immigration... other countries, such as Germany, have laid down rules for transit passengers)"
Wow you have just given a brilliant idea! I will just leave my suitcase behind and fly just with a small hand luggage suitcase that goes in the airplane with me. Then I just go to connections and catch the other flight
That is a terrible idea as your unclaimed suitcase will be disposed of by the airport and you will lose everything in it.
"I think Iveta's plans are all a bit shaky at the moment, but nowhere near as shaky as the government's quarantine plans :-)"
"""That is a terrible idea as your unclaimed suitcase will be disposed of by the airport and you will lose everything in it.""I'm pretty sure Iveta meant that she would leave it behind at wherever she is travelling from, not at the airport."
"I won't take any suitcases...just hand luggage.Edited: 5:58 am, May 24, 2020 "
"I think Iveta's comment was about not taking a suitcase, not leaving it behind at the airport...."
Are you guys sure that I can just go to connections and board the next flight (without passing border control as I will have no suitcases) if the 2 flights are on 2 separate tickets?
"Yes you can as long as you can show the boarding pass for your next flight or failing that the booking. I did it a dew weeks ago and was allowed through from T5 to T2 by showing my reservation on my phone. I didn't have boarding pass for my LH flight as had to show documents to the airline first. It was no problem ! However as there are so few passengers there were long gaps between buses, this was mae up for by having no wait for security !"
"Thank you for your reply. My next flight is actually on the same terminal. Terminal 2! I assume I just go to connections, get to the check in desk of the new airline check in and pass just security again."

""" I assume I just go to connections, get to the check in desk of the new airline check in and pass just security again.""Bettee to get your boarding pass in advance if possible. Check-in desks are usually landside.Edited: 6:40 pm, May 24, 2020 "
How do you mean check in desks are landside? When you have a connecting flight and you just continue to connections you are once again in the departure lounge and all airlines's desk are there for passengers to check in? Then you pass security again and off to your gate . What am I missing?
"What he said is if you don't have a boarding pass for your next flight, you may have to clear immigration to recheck for your flight, and the checking in desks are usually landside."
"The way connections work at London Heathrow, you need a boarding pass for a flight departing that terminal that day before you will be allowed into the departure lounge. (OK, I know there's a special case for Terminal 3, but T3 is closed at the moment..) Same-ticket passengers usually have their boarding pass for the connecting flight before boarding the first one.If you can check in on-line and get your boarding pass, either by printing it before you get to the airport or by loading it onto a smartphone, you're OK in normal times on multiple tickets. If you have a same-ticket connecting flight and couldn't get the boarding pass for the second flight for some reason, there are transfer desks before you get to the departure lounge that can help you. But they aren't check in desks. and even in normal times they won't check you in, that has to be done one way or another before you reach Heathrow, or you must go landside to do it. Now the UK Government has as usual failed to supply enough detail, so you may have to wait until the start date of the quarantine plan to find out what happens."
"When I did it my first flight out of EDI was on BA, they could not check me in but did check my luggage through (both flights were on one ticket on a KLM itinerary to get me home) I just showed the KLM ticket and was allowed into T2 and was checked in at the LH transfer desk there. At that time the LH group desks were the only ones open"
So then I have another problem because on the first flight from Sao Paulo to London (Latam Airlines) I am allowed 1 hand luggage of 10 kg + 1 personal item like a handbag or laptop. I was going to get my racksack and a small 10 kg suitcase. But for the second airlines Bulgaria Air from Heathrow to Sofia they only allow 1 hand luggage! So I will have to check in the small 10 kg suitcase once I get to connections. How would that be possible?Let's say I check in and print my boarding pass or load it on my mobile but how would I check in the small suitcase if these desks are only transfer desk and not check in desks.

I assumed that you can check in for your next flight on flight connections point. I didn't realise they are only transfer desks
This is what they have said:International transit passengers arriving at Heathrow airport will be able to make onward connections as normal without formality.But there are 2 types of transit passengers. Landside and airside! No explanation on that whatsoever
"""So I will have to check in the small 10 kg suitcase once I get to connections.""I strongly suspect you will need to go landside to check in any luggage (and probably also to check in if you cannot do this in advance online). So that means you'll need to clear immigration. Alternatively you can try to board your Bulgaria Air flight with too much handluggage. Either nobody will notice or they will take your trolley at the gate and check it there. Note that you will likely be required a fee for this though."
I think it's too much for me to worry about. I will wait until further information is posted on this. They need to clarify what the rules will be for landside passengers and then I will decide what to do.
"You could fly from Sao Paulo on KLM via Amsterdam, I don't believe there are any restrictions, but check it."
Unfortunately I already bought my ticket to London before they announced this stupid quarantine :(At least they should provide more details about all kinds of transit passengers. Who do I contact for more information? I have tried Twitter but nobody is responding
I expect we will know more when we get closer to the measures being actually implemented (in 2 weeks).
"I received an email from the British embassy which states:Thank you for your contact. Given that your final destination is Bulgaria and need to transit the UK boarder to return home, you may do so without self-isolating. You should avoid using public transportation to travel between ports. Please make sure to have all your flight reservation and documentation to show during your entering in the country. Best regards,"
"UK Travel bosses want quarantine plan scrapped completely -- https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52819575""The letter says the government ""must not exceed its mandate"". ""The people of this country do not wish to be prevented from travelling.""Maybe so, that doesn't mean others want us to be arriving, or we want to be receiving them. To me, the ""must not exceed its mandate"" quote is to line up a legal challenge."
"I have thought the proposals were a mess since they were first announced, and I've seen nothing to change my mind since."
Do you think there is any real chance it will be completely scrapped before 8th June?
I hope so but my guess is they'll run it for 3 weeks so not to lose face and then scrap it.
My guess is they will implement it but do nothing to enforce it and just let it fade away into the background until they announce how successful it's been but they can now do away with it as we move to the next phase of the roadmap to recovery.However all bets off if Dominic Cummings decides to take his wife and child for a weekend away in Europe.
"Luv it Tom, a classic! I actually laughed out loud ;-) Maybe we could club together and get them some cheap flights to Rio. I agree with both of you, they have to save face at this point *and* find a way out urgently IMO. The FCO advice is possibly the mechanism, the quarantine story constantly refers to Brits returning, but it only affects visitors unless the FCO issue an update to permit us to travel. I was expecting that update to align on the 8th June but no word of it so far. The fly in the ointment is oor Nicola, our FM had been pushing for border controls from the off, she's going to try to score huge political (indyref2) points if they try to back down. She's likely to force them to keep it longer than we'd like - certainly me.Edited: 8:10 am, May 28, 2020 "
"Our problem is that like all UK Government designed web sites they never work [universal credit one of the most recent examples] and the Track & Trace has crashed before it even started. Other countries don't want UK citizens coming into their countries because they don't trust that people are being checked. The UK Government allowed the Cheltenham Festival to take place and the Liverpool-Atletico Madrid Uefa Champions League against medical advice both of which have now been proved to have been a major cause of the spread of the virus especially across England. Personally we have stay away from everyone and did so 2 weeks before the Scottish lock down on advice from friends abroad and we are not taking government advice and will continue to stay away from everyone for at least another month as countries who have relaxed their lockdown are now seeing numbers rise again. We have holidays booked for Rumania, Hungary and Italy over the next 3 months, but it is better to be bored at home than DEAD!"
">>>My guess is they will implement it but do nothing to enforce it and just let it fade away into the background<<<This. They won't do a U turn on the quarantine. They won't care how enforceable it is, but they will go very quiet about it and hope that it all blows over and is forgotten about. As usual the majority will comply, but most who don't want to will get away with it.MikeBR, I couldn't agree with you more about Cheltenham and the football. The UK government never really cared about the health of the nation. They didn't want to close schools. Councils and schools themselves made their own decisions. My wife was working from home for weeks before the lockdown. Johnson and his chums only acted when it was obvious that they had to. Even then the strategy was to flatten the curve, not to beat the virus as it was in countries like New Zealand."
There may be another agenda behind why it is being introduced now. It may be the fact that there is an immigration bill going through and the nemesis of the tories has always been immigration. The quarantine measure could play into their hands in trying to deter anyone visiting from overseas. My hunch tends to agree with you that there will be no U turn. Pritti Patel is overseeing it and she is as hard line as they come. You are right about Cheltenham and the football but why when we were in the peak our boarder was still open and there was no requirement to self isolate. The timing makes no sense but as with anything that this government does to manage the virus does either. Trouble is it will still be in place for months to come and generally forgotten about apart from the fines it generates as a money spinner. Legally they have to review it every three weeks.
"I can't be the only one wishing that all the countries who became aware early on had taken urgent and effective action to close down all travel from known hotspots. I'm not even sure I want to travel in the new circumstances with masks, temperature checks, social distancing etc. So much of what I enjoyed, concerts, meals in nice restaurants and even enjoying interaction with local people and fellow travellers is going to be restricted. I'm not sure if I'd rather not go, or travel as I used to and accept the risks. There is no point in living longer, or avoiding all risk, if it totally spoils the quality of life and enjoyment of new experiences. That sounds rather selfish, but the other side of the argument is the dreadful damage done to the tourist industry and the livelihoods of those who will lose their jobs if we can only travel under severely restricted conditions. I am theoretically in an at risk group on grounds of age, but I could equally get knocked down crossing the road tomorrow. We maybe need to understand the concept of risk and adjust our attitude towards it."
"Our problem is that like all UK Government designed web sites they never work---Having delivered two very successful UK gov websites, I take exception to that :-) Enforcement is a devolved matter. I've not seen the governments of Scotland, Wales, or NI saying they'll enforce it. I *have* seen plenty of backbench Tories saying this makes the UK look closed at the exact time the politicians are saying ""global Britain"". If it happens, it won't be enforced and it'll be quietly dropped after three weeks. I also expect a further exemption to be made for arrivals from the EU."

"""Having delivered two very successful UK gov websites, I take exception to that :-)"" But you forgot to mention the number of unsuccessful websites you were responsible for.As they say a broken clock is right twice a dayOnly joking of course - I spent my entire working life in the civil service."
"Sorry Tom, I've taken my reply down as I rather 'bit the bait' on that one, don't like to offend. I'm still not sure I'd have owned up to that Darren, nope, definitely not."
Hmmm this is an interesting discussion from the other side of the world.Check out the cases/deaths for Australia and NZ where we closed out borders. Realise our population is smaller so convert to per million.Recent opinion poll shows 92% support in NZ for the way our Government is handling it.
"Try this graphic Mike - https://www.kayak.com/travel-restrictions/Only 9 countries in the world without border restrictions, and now that they're coming down, we're puting them up"
"The obvious difference between the Australia/NZ and the UK is the time at which border restrictions were (or will be) imposed. In any case, for the countries that did close borders early, I really doubt how much this has contributed to stopping the spread of COVID in those countries. E.g. in my home country of Denmark (who were quick to close borders), the virus was primarily brought in by Danes who were returning home from holidays in Northern Italy and Austria. Border closure did nothing to prevent this."
"Though you could compare the response to that of Greece, which did close borders (only just reopening) and required their own citizens to quarantine for 2 weeks if they returned from abroad. I know people who were caught in the quarantine, and the police did come round and check they actually were where they said they would be. Just look at the results they got in terms of lower infection and death rates."
"Add me to the list of the cynical who thinks there is an underlying motive.- Brought in over three months too late.- Nearly a month from when Johnson first announced the measure and it being in place.- No meaningful way that it can be effectively managed.If nothing else the logic flawed, unless...Edited: 8:31 am, May 29, 2020 "
"That site is incorrect. The borders in Australia and NZ are completely closed.Only citizens and permanent reddidents can get in, and they go into supervised isolation.Foregners are unable to enter without a specific exemtion in very rare cases.We expect free travel between NZ, Australia and perhaps some Pacific Island (Fiji and Samoa) shortly."
Today it's all over the press that the quarantine will be cancelled before it's even up and running. Yesterday BA started pulling loads of flights for July and have probably jumped the gun. My own flights from LHR-CHQ are still going ahead but flights from GLA and EDI to LHR have dropped to nothing except for LCY.Fortunately I can travel to MAN and pick up flights to CHQ for half the price.
"""Today it's all over the press that the quarantine will be cancelled before it's even up and running.""I haven't seen anything about this. Do you have any links?"
"""I haven't seen anything about this""---Same here too Lex. All I've seen is that some travel companies are calling for the government to scrap the 14 day quarantine plan."
"I had 2 out of 4 July flights cancelled by BA yesterday. The EDI- LHR and LHR-EDI segments. My flights to and from Marseille are still scheduled. I’ve not gone into MMB to see what options are a ai Le as replacement flights.I think their is a slim chance I can travel to Provence in late July. I’m not going to book replacement flights or ask for a refund until late in June when the position is much clearer. I doubt quarantine will still be in place in the U.K. by then, but if it were, staying at home for 2 weeks isn’t an issue. I live alone, will work from home for the rest of this year and have my groceries delivered.I do think this proposal or scheme is crazy and illogical. I don’t say that because I love to travel. 3 months ago it would have made sense but not now."
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-837…that's the only article I've read regarding the quarantine
"Sorry, it was the article in the Mail but there was also one in the Telegraph/Evening Standard moaning about it. I was in a bigger rush to head out golfing (wish I hadn't bothered tbh)"
I certainly wouldn't rely on the Daily Fail for accuracy but agree the planned quarantine is unenforceable unless you want to put a lot of resources into it.As I said in a previous comment I don't see them officially scrapping the plan - they will probably just stop talking about it and let it fade away until in 3 weeks time they announce it has been a great success but they no longer need it.
"Hi, I’ve got 2 related questions. 1st: when self connecting at Dub to a BA flight with hand luggage only, do I still need to exit and go through departures again? 2nd. If I buy a multi Segment flight on the Air Lingus website (where both flights are with Air Lingus) can I connect airside at Dub or will I need to go out and through departures. Thanks so much. R"
#252I don’t see the connection to your questions about transfers in Dublin to this thread. You might be best starting a new thread of your own.
RobertKDue to the common travel area any UK arrivals from Dublin are exempt from any UK quarantine but that is irrelevant for the arrangements for any transfers or departures from Dublin.
"Further pressure on the government, today, to quash the plan. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52873689If it is implemented, I really don't see it being around for long"
I saw a pice from Michael o’Leary yesterday that basically repeated his view that the 14 day quarantine was unworkable and passengers would put something like Mickey Mouse of 1 Walt Disney Drive as their details on the form to be completed.Let’s wait and see
"Or even Dominic Cummings, The Spare Cottage, Durham."
"Mwahh . . . superb guys, just what this climate of doom n gloom needs.I've got a lot of time for MOL, just got to love his candour . . . . or loathe it !!"
"Sorry to hijack this thread but I have looked high and low at procedures for airport changes. We are flying to the Channel Islands which is only served by Southampton Airport but arriving from Sweden at either LHR/LGW on the same day (possibly night before). In the Bailiwick of Guernsey, we will have to quarantine for 14 days. I don't want to undertake 2 sessions of quarantine (in the UK followed by Guernsey). Obviously, variation of the question applies for the return journey from SOU to LHR/LGW.Any tips/links gratefully received"
EtoileBased on what I've seen about the proposed UK quarantine you will probably officially need to spend 14 days in quarantine after your arrival in the UK although the details of how it will be operated are thin on the ground at present.How it will be enforced is another matter
"When are you planning to do this?But if Guernsey is anything like the UK, you won't be getting much of a holiday there, not even hotels are open here at the moment...."
Early July - second home owner with elderly parents in the Bailiwick. Plenty to do after the 14 days
Are you allowed to stay with them? You wouldn't be here until you've quarantined for 14 days. We are not supposed to be going to stay with any of our family.
No. That's not our intention. As a second home owner we have a vacant property awaiting our arrival.
That's ok then! I hope you can find out if you will have to quarantine here....

"I would scrap it and lets see just how many people book and fly anywhere this year , especially if the government make it very clear they will not facilitate any repatriation should a second outbreak trap people abroad."

It'll be scrapped after the initial 3 week period.
Bit more detail in The Guardian about todays meeting between Govt and Travel sectors https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/ju…
"""'ll be scrapped after the initial 3 week period.""I think that would be too much of a ""U turn"" even for Boris. I suspect they would water down the list by exempting all EU arrivals and ""safe"" Asian arrivals at the first review. Water it down even further at the next to leave only the USA, Africa and South Americans on the naughty list. Maybe the USA will be moved to the nice list if they let us in."
Like the other Covid restrictions I doubt it will be scrapped anytime soon but it will be amended and changed for political reasons
It seems Willie Walsh is considering a legal challenge over the 14 day quarantine period. I believe Ryanair have just backed that move as well.

Thanks motherwell. I got the info from breaking news on TV so nothing printed at the time to link.
"I'd be curious to know what the legal basis is, to mount such a challenge.Edited: 11:12 am, June 05, 2020 "
"Just bluster. No basis for legal challenge. The UK government sets the rules, not BA or an Irish airline."
Anybody can take a legal challenge to the High. Court against UK Gov action - whether the court decides to hear it or not and the outcome is another matter.Remember the individual whose name escapes me over Brexit in the early days over the UK Gov plan to not allow Parliament a role in the process
"Also on the BBC now -- https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52938831Just a rehash of the Sky interview Motherwell linked to, but it does say they would be discussing it with their lawyers today, that they are burning £1M an hour, they have borrowed £300M from BoE, which is the max available, and in other releases have implied they would write July off completely if there was a quarantine.I don't think it's 'bluster' but it may be for the purpose of intense pressure on the Gov to see it ends swiftly, specifically with an eye on a clear run at July."
">>> Anybody can take a legal challenge to the High. Court against UK Gov action - whether the court decides to hear it or not and the outcome is another matter. <<<=======I'm well aware of that anyone with enough money, time and the inclination can take the Government to the High Court. I'm curious to as what was the legal issue they are considering challenging on, because I can't see an obvious one. From Walsh's interview yesterday he hinted it was around consultation - but, I'm not sure that is a robust reason in itself.I too don't think it is bluster they are hemorrhaging colossal sums money in double quick time and in the scheme of 'things' the cost of court action is relatively small potatoes. If nothing else it keeps the issue in the public eye and may force the Government to release the science that they based their decision on (or not) and highlight the absurdity of what has been put in place. Of course this may be their motive rather than expecting to win a court case, who knows?Edited: 4:58 am, June 06, 2020 "

"Cabin Crew staff based at Heathrow are also on different contracts.

Avoid contact with them and minimise the time you spend in shared spaces, like kitchens, bathrooms and sitting areas.If you’re staying in a hotel or guest house, you must stay away from others who didn’t travel with you, so it’s important that you don’t use shared areas such as bars, restaurants, health clubs and sports facilities. Stay 2 metres apart from other people staying there at all times.It is important to avoid contact with other people in your home in order to reduce the risk of transmitting coronavirus. You should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window to the outside that can be opened, separate from other people in your home.If you can, you should use a separate bathroom from the rest of the household. If you have to share these facilities, regular cleaning will be required after each person has used them. Make sure you use separate towels from the other people in your house, both for drying yourself after bathing or showering and for hand-hygiene purposes."""

"I think that the way that the PM and the cabinet have behaved can be summed up with the phrase 'We will follow the science, but only if we like it and Dom agrees with it'.The quarantine and the advice on air travel in general are shining examples of that in my book, but there plenty more I could refer to.Edited: 6:41 am, June 13, 2020 "

"All countries should have this, and really it should be permanent. This will keep people at home because most wont have the ability to be off work long enough to 14 day quarantine on both ends of their trip. You all need to accept the fact that travel is done. You enjoy where you live now, or you move somewhere else."
"Bit harsh, don't you think?My three children and three grandchildren live in Australia so we go from the UK to spend a couple of months with them every year. I'm an Australian citizen and we have planned to live there next year but not everyone can just pack up and go to where their kids are. Or their parents for that matter.We're not just talking people's two weeks holiday abroad scenario - there are all sorts of reasons why people go to foreign countries."
It’s complicated for sure. And for the record I’m not expecting anyone to agree with my opinion. I’m fairly certain this forum is for sharing both info and opinions & just because mine is likely the unpopular one doesn’t mean I’m not allowed to share it.As far as it being harsh I really don’t think it is. If you go for a few months you would have the ability to abide by quarantine protocol and visit your family. If you move you of course would have the ability to do the same.
"<< You all need to accept the fact that travel is done. You enjoy where you live now, or you move somewhere else. >>Very ideological. Travel is not done, not by any means. How is anyone supposed to move somewhere else anyway, if travel is done?"
"""All countries should have this, and really it should be permanent.... You all need to accept the fact that travel is done.""And I thought I was pessimistic, whilst I agree that travel should be kept to a minimum in the short term the view that travel is done ignores the many benefits that come from travelling abroad."
Moving is fine. Because you could quarantine for 14 days without issue. Recreational just shouldn’t be a thing. Having a valid reason to be somewhere is not the issue. It’s the running around unchecked that needs to cease. And again this is simply just my opinion. Those who choose to think or behave differently are certainly free to do so.
"It’s the running around unchecked that needs to cease. - I accept you have your view and would be interested to know whether ""running around unchecked"" should also apply to interstate travel within the USA.Is there really much difference between travelling from Europe to the USA and travel between the East and West coasts of the US"
"It’s not pessimism. I truly believe COVID-19 will one day be in our past, and am optimistic about the future of our world. I personally just don’t think recreational travel beyond the borders of your own country should be permitted going forward without strict adherence to a set of global guidelines that will make it impossible for most to behave in this fashion.If you can allow for 14 days on each end to quarantine and are willing to monitored during your time away then that’s fine."
That would be up to each nations government to decide. Personally I would not be an advocate of that type of behavior either.
"I agree with Bella. These days families might be based in two, three or more countries. To say “travel is done” is to suggest no one should/will ever be able to see their family members again.Many people who are retired or who save up their annual leave or are lucky enough to have the opportunity to take a sabbatical will spend a month or more abroad with family. Of course, if you’re a driver delivering food or meds across borders or you’ve got essential business abroad you could tack on a quick visit to friends or relatives. So many of the rules under which we are supposed to operate at present simply don’t stand up to scrutiny as a long term strategy. Why make it worse by speculating the worst possible outcome?"
"Again I’m not expecting anyone to agree with my opinion. My understanding was that this board is here to share ideas, information, and opinions. No one has to like my opinion (or agree with it for that matter). And if you think I expected many to agree that is certainly not the case. In the long run everyone will continue to act as they see fit, this is clear. I just don’t happen to agree with the way people as a whole will choose to behave. I’ve already set up my own personal set of rules and behaviors that will work for me in the long run. Others will certainly do the same. Some will be more open with their behaviors & decisions, while others will be less so."
"without strict adherence to a set of global guidelines - I wonder who you would suggest sets those global guidelines, the UN, WHO, President Trump or A. N. Other.At the moment each country are setting whatever guidelines they consider appropriate - I may not agree with those guidelines but you have to respect their right to set whatever guidelines they want.Would you suggest that individual countries give up this right in favour of a set of global guidelines - Good luck convincing your President to accept that position"
For starters I’m definitely not a trump supporter in any way shape or form. And yes if we are a globalized society we should be just that.
">>> All countries should have this, and really it should be permanent <<<======Even if there is no logic or science behind it?"
"And yes if we are a globalized society we should be just that. - We may be globalised in terms of trade but are far from that position in terms of political decisions.You still haven't answered the questions I posed in #320""without strict adherence to a set of global guidelines - I wonder who you would suggest sets those global guidelines, the UN, WHO, President Trump or A. N. Other."""
Yes.
"Oh well, it's given us a little more entertainment than I had expected on a Sunday afternoon!"
Interesting that those with what would probably be considered extreme opinions just respond with the one word answer when challenged .If we introduce measures that are simply not backed by logic or science how about banning all public transport - getting on a bus/train surely carries a risk of spreading the virus.Lets go a step further and forcibly isolate (imprison) all those who test positive.

"The quarantine rules in the UK are being reviewed every three weeks, there is a strong rumour they will be abolished in early July and the social distancing rule is to be dropped to one metre before the 5 th July in time for pubs/ restaurants re- opening. Obviously it’s dependent on the numbers not rising but currently in the U.K. its estimated that 1 in 1,600 people have the virus, you would have to bump into that person and they would have to cough/ sneeze in your face to contract it, either that or you don’t keep your hands clean. By the start of July that figure could be 1 in 5000 if the percentages continue to drop as is being witnessed. Lockdown has been on release for over a month now and the figure show no sign of going back up, only down. There will be spikes as we go along this journey because that’s happened in most Countries, the spikes have quickly subsided and continued to drop. Italy was on its knees with this virus only a couple of months ago and look at it now...look at New York!"
It's ridiculous to try and stop people travelling permanently. It will never happen. It can never happen.
"They can only keep aircraft on the ground for so long, if the virus is going to hang around we will learn to live with it, human beings are very adaptable."
"'All countries should have this [quarantine], and really it should be permanent. This will keep people at home because most wont have the ability to be off work long enough to 14 day quarantine on both ends of their trip.' I'd like to see the science and evidence for this being an effective measure in the short or long term.'You all need to accept the fact that travel is done. You enjoy where you live now, or you move somewhere else.' One person's opinion, nothing more."
"It's an opinion, but a rather odd one to my mind. Hundreds and even thousands of years ago people travelled, though the majority tended to never go more than a few miles from where they lived."

">>> They can only keep aircraft on the ground for so long, if the virus is going to hang around we will learn to live with it, human beings are very adaptable.<<<======Absolutely.Its far from certain that a vaccine will ever be developed and as such plans for a future must be made where Covid (sans a vaccine) is just one of a number of risks in life that exist.Edited: 3:35 pm, June 14, 2020 "
"Some people need to wake up.In Ireland the government has already stated there will be no second lockdown if a ""second wave"" (and how do we know that we're not in a 3rd or 4th wave already, it's been in the country long before it was reported) occurs.They have said they know enough about it now that they can be proactive about it.I said it previously, the quarantine will be scrapped after the 3 week review, if not totally scrapped it'll be adjusted to be more friendly to anyone wanting to travel."
"""In Ireland the government has already stated there will be no second lockdown if a ""second wave"" (and how do we know that we're not in a 3rd or 4th wave already, it's been in the country long before it was reported) occurs.""That is the word in at least one other country I know of as well. Basically there will be measures to protect vulnerable groups but a full lockdown like we've gone through in many European is unlikely to happen."
">>> said it previously, the quarantine will be scrapped after the 3 week review, if not totally scrapped it'll be adjusted to be more friendly to anyone wanting to travel <<<======Yes, it will depend on when the Government feel they will get to the position where they will not lose face.In the interests of transparency it would good to see the scientific evidence they based their decision on.Edited: 6:40 pm, June 15, 2020 "
A Commons select committee has demanded to see the scientific evidence behind the quarantine. My hunch is that Pritti Patel will try and fudge this one as the science does not back her current position. She claims that it is supported by the majority and is necessary to control the virus. That might have been the case back in March during the peak when we still had open boarders. Totally illogical now and definitely not supported by the many whose travel plans are wrecked because of it. The wrong thing that is guaranteed is that the government won't admit that they got this one wrong.
"Perhaps this is just the first of many future issues where the isolationist policies of our government have let us down. A little more consultation with our erstwhile European partners might have led to a more reasoned and effective approach.It's time we got over our British is best attitude .... World class track and trace, carefully judged lockdown? I don't think so. Boris is so out of his depth and his rambling efforts to avoid questions or provide a coherent policy have done enormous damage. We are destined to become once again, the sick man of Europe. ( The Continent not the community)"
"No, the U.K. is not a financial basket case like many EU Countries and the Government have been guided by the scientists/virologists,maybe they should be held to account? When was the last time the U.K. was the sickman of Europe, the economy has been booming over the last few years thanks to the Governments handling of the finances. If you don’t like it then jump on the Eurostar instead of putting the boot into the Country, you get fed up of it. You don’t realise how lucky you are to live in the UK, show a bit of gratitude.Edited: 7:25 pm, June 15, 2020 "
Post 340 I presume is satirical. It's really quite amusing.
"""Post 340 I presume is satirical"" - I suspect you might be mistaken as ReedRover posted this on 8 April""The Government have done brilliantly since the virus kicked off, provided a financial buffer to help the people stay at home and just built a 4000 bed Hospital in London in 9 days, it’s the largest hospital in the world, built in nine days. Instead of putting the boot in to the UK, show a bit of nationalism or move to another Country quickly""I respect his right to that opinion although I don't agree with the ""done brilliantly"" conclusion and wonder whether he has changed his view since that post."
">>> maybe they should be held to account? When was the last time the U.K. was the sickman of Europe, <<<======[1} Strike out maybe. [2] Given the deaths and the rate of infection from Covid the UK *is* currently the sick man of Europe.Edited: 6:44 pm, June 15, 2020 "

">>> Well if I were to be praising any leader for their handling of this pandemic, it wouldn’t be BoJo. On the other hand Jacinda Ardern would be at the top of my list. <<<======Johnson has been found out and is woefully out of his depth, the dull as ditchwater Raab did a better job when the blonde bombshell was off sick.Agreed about Ardern, but the size of population, demographic and relative isolation/location of NZ was very much in her favour. That said I'm sure if Johnson had been PM of NZ he would have negated those advantages in spectacular fashion."
