Have you ever experienced a random act of kindness by a local when travelling? Tell us about it!
On holiday in Turkey we were introduced to a friend of a friend (both Turkish). He told us he was about to start a residential training course so let us use his car for two weeks. Amazing.
"Have had many but one of the first was in the USA, we were travelling with our kids and stopped at a diner for breakfast. The kids wanted to sit at the counter not in a booth, so we got talking to the regulars. When we went to pay, the server told us that our breakfast had been paid for by one of them. We were gobsmacked, she said he is loaded and a great guy. Could not even thank him personally but never forgot the southern hospitality."
"^^ cough, cough..,"
"Once, when I walked out of the men's room, a lady came and told me I had a long trail of toilet paper sticking to my shoe. If I would have know what a valued commodiity it would be today, I would have saved it instead of throwing it in the trash."
"Hitch, there's me thinking you were doing your POTUS impression."
"#7 If you think that's funny, you should leave the Layover Lounge and come see Hitch and the rest of us over on the OTC forum. We only fly first class, although a couple of people in economy try to reach the same dizzy heights. They fail miserably."
Here is my 10th random act of kindness. Hurrah for the 3 amigos (and our compatriots)
"Last year in Italy my BF left his backpack under a bench in Sorrento. He had quickly gone into a store for something and then we rushed to hop on a van and completely forgot it. When we returned to the square after our day trip, he checked in w/ a local shop and some kind soul told us they had returned it to the police. We got it back- everything left untouched! Much love to you Italy!"
"Trying to cross a really (really) busy road in HoChi Min, must have been 4 lanes of fast moving motorbikes, my husband and I stood at the side of the road aghast. A tiny old lady, in PJ's, conical hat and flip flops came out of nowhere, grabbed my arm, took off her hat and started waving it as she guided us through the throng. As we got to the other side we turned to thank her, but she was gone! we just saw her hat moving away form us down the street. We've had a lot of encounters like that over the years whilst travelling but that one sticks in my mind. Keep safe."
"In Glasgow at the train station, just figuring out the ticket machine. A local man comes over, makes sure we have what we need. Our journey required us to change trains at Glasgow Central. This lovely man walked with us, out of his way, to show us where we needed to go. Only when we were where we needed to be did he turn around and continue his own journey. At our accommodation our host had told us that Glaswegians are the friendliest people and that the motto is ""People make Glasgow"". Indeed they had big banners up all over the place saying just that. We experienced that it's true and the kindness we experienced in Glasgow will stay with us as one of the dominant memories of our holiday. Love you Glasgow!!"
"In Paris, I was standing on a corner with my map open. I could tell which corner I was on, obviously, but I suffer from severe hemisphere disorientation when in the northern hemisphere and could not for the life of me figure out which way was north. I'm spinning the map around looking puzzled and a lovely Parisian lady, who did not appear to speak English, came up to me and kindly turned my map and showed me which way was which, before going on her way. Merci madame, Merci."
"I was standing admiring the view over the sea on a coastal path in Funchal, Madeira when I noticed two ladies nearby whispering. One of them came over and told my that my dress was on inside out! I laughed and thanked her then found the nearest ladies bathroom to swap it round. Not the first time I've worn my clothes inside out and certainly won't be the last but the first time anyone has come over to tell me. I should really wear my glasses to get dressed."
"I have encountered many acts of kindness since i first visited Marmaris , Turkey . I have never encountered a country who's people are so helpful , even a very poor person dressed in old clothing helped with directions , i offered her some money but she refused and walked away . Another time i was looking for a good Tattooist and the bar manager said he knows of one that could do what i wanted , he then said c'mon and i will take you there , which he did and i hopped on the back of his Scooter and i got a great tattoo . There are many other instances .Edited: 6:25 am, March 27, 2020 "
"On my last trip, which was to Oman... My partner and I had just finished dinner at a small local restaurant with tons of yummy food. When we asked for the bill we realised that we were both out of cash, so my partner stepped out to go to the nearest ATM. Just at that moment, a man who had been eating not too far away from our table stood up, told my partner not to worry and went to the counter to pay our bill. We insisted that we were going to get money, but he said that he wanted to invite us and that we were his guests. We were incredibly touched by his kindness, he was truly happy to just pay for our food. Oman is a wonderful country with beautiful people. :)"
"In Naples a few years ago, we were very, very lost finding our accommodation. No phone to call the poor host. After 40 minutes of not knowing where we were anymore, a young man who we asked directions from said he knew where it was, so follow him. He took my suitcase (bless him!!) and walked us for 20 minutes to the meeting place.Nice people are around, too, not just ***holes!"
"In NYC, our first attempt using the subway resulted in missing our stop near Central Park and riding into Bronx. A fellow female passenger walked us out on the next stop, and brought us to the correct platform.She was not the only helpful New Yorkers we encountered during our short trip there. My heart is with all New Yorkers as they grapple Covid 19. Be Stong, New York."
"During a layover in Toronto airport I got chatting with a couple at the next table. We conversed and shared a drink while enjoying our respective meals. The husband went to pay his bill and when he returned I asked for assistance in working out the tip. He just looked at me and said ""Don't worry, it's taken care of. Welcome to Canada"". I was blown away."
"We were staying on the outskirts of Rome for our honeymoon because we used our Marriott points. On the last night we wanted to go to the mall Parco Leonardo. The hotel said they would call us a taxi to go and when we were ready to return we could call them and they would send us a taxi to bring us back. Well that did not happen.We called the hotel and they said they could not do that, so we were stuck in Parco Leonardo 25 minutes from the hotel, and could not find a taxi anywhere. It was already getting dark.We went to a watch shop and asked them what we could do to find a taxi. One of the ladies told us that she was going to get off work in a couple of minutes and she could take us to the hotel. We waited for her outside the mall and she picked us up and took us to the Courtyard hotel that was close to the mall. But that was not our hotel. We didn't tell her that. We thanked her. We were very grateful that she had done that for us. We then went inside the hotel and they called us a taxi to take us to the Marriott.We will never forget this lady. That was an incredible act of kindness.Edited: 6:16 am, March 28, 2020 "
"YES! So glad you asked.I travel a lot with my Mother we have a special bond that makes us perfect traveling companions. Since finding out about our Scottish ancestry, we have made two trips to Scotland. We try to stay in B&Bs as we enjoy meeting locals. In 2017 while staying in a B&B in Dunkeld, my mother's C-Pap machine's hose split just as we were getting ready for bed. This was the beginning of our trip and the prospect of spending 2 weeks without that machine was frightening for her. So I asked the gentleman of the house for tape. He asked if he could help and when I showed him the hose he said . ""hold on"". His wife then knocked on our door and had two brand new hoses in her hand. She used the exact same machine and had an extra hose! She gladly gave it to my Mom and saved our trip. An act of kindness like that would never have happened in a chain hotel. We were eternally grateful and are committed to lodging at B&Bs whenever we can."

"In Danang, Vietnam. We got a taxi to the boat we were taking a dinner cruise on, to watch the dragon bridge breathe fire. Half an hour in my husband realised that he hadn’t got his phone, much gnashing of teeth ensued as he guessed he had left it at the bar we had visited pre taxi. Thank God for travel insurance I suggested, more gnashing ! As we got off the boat imagine our surprise to be met by the taxi driver, on the back of his wife’s scooter, holding out my husband’s (expensive) phone !!! The kindness of the Vietnamese people is amazing. Of course, a very generous tip was given."
"We were staying in Parga when the Icelandic volcano blew, Petros the accommodation owner gave us use of his laptop and his phone after getting us a direct contact with Olympic airlines who spoke good English so that we could keep up to date on a daily basis."
On a school trip skiing in the mountains of Austria we were told we had to walk to the hotel that would provide lunch. It was a long walk and I soon lagged behind. A car pulled up and the German speaking local pointed to the passenger seat so I jumped in and he dropped me off at the front of our group. Thinking back i suppose he could have kidnapped me or worse.
"Also, we went to Berlin for a 4 day break.Best way of getting around was by train but we were stumped as all the stations had ticket machines and we could not work out how to access.On three occasions someone came to our aid speaking excellent English.Many in the UK are critical of Germans as being unfriendly but I take the opposite view and find my hotel choice is often full of Germans.They have the right idea in the sauna as well"
"Hı Folks,Here is an old but a very good thread on random acts of kindness at the İstanbul forums, started by my good friend Busy-retired. ""https:/…replies"". Lots of good deeds in there.Enigma..."

"When in Porto years ago, we were trying to find a specific port house. A woman looked at our map, then motioned for us to follow her. We headed up steep inclines into a neighborhood. After awhile, she handed us off to a very elderly woman and indicated we should follow her. She took off at a fast pace before we could say no; we could barely keep up, but she was amazing and delivered us to the location. It was amazingly kind!"
"We were in Paris and we don't speak French. We had walked and walked and finally decided to take the underground to the Eiffel Tower, which we could see in the distance. We went to the counter to convey to the ticket seller that we wanted two (showed him two fingers) tickets to the Eiffel Tower. He very rudely said - speak French, speak French!'.....well if we had known how to speak French, we would have done that. I'm sure that he knew very well that we wanted two tickets to the Eiffel Tower. Just as we were dealing with trying to communicate to the man who was deliberately treating us rudely, a middle aged older woman saw what was happening and came over and bought our tickets for us and wouldn't take any money! I'm sure she was trying to make up for his rudeness and we were very grateful to her!A while back on our first visit to New York City, we were on our first subway ride and we had no idea of where to get off. A woman sitting next to us heard us talking, told us where to get off and then she got off with us to walk to the top of the stairs to point us in the right direction - then she turned around and went back down to get on the next subway train. We found New Yorkers to be very helpful with helping visitors navigate the subway system.Edited: 7:19 pm, May 26, 2020 "
"We have experienced so many random acts of kindness, that we will never be able to catch up with ours."
