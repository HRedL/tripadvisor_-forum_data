"Hi all,My wife and I planned a 10 year anniversary trip to Vietnam and Japan. Just about everything is booked, but we're a little worried at this point about the Coronavirus. We used chase points and our cards for the majority of the bookings, but after speaking with them they said we're not covered for the virus. Are there any companies that would cover something like this in case we needed to cancel due to things getting worse?Thank you so much for any responses!"
"Suggest you go to insuremytrip.com. They are a very good company. Speak to an agent about what you need. Sometimes, it is not possible to insure for a known threat, but talk with them.I would never travel out-of-the country, virus or no virus, without a good travel insurance company. Good luck and Happy Anniversary.Edited: 1:38 pm, February 16, 2020 "
"Agree you should talk to a place like insuremytrip. Also suggest you research some policies thru them, read policies and maybe call an insurance co. or two if have any questions.When you say chase points and your cards don't cover this I'm not sure I understand what you mean. You mean insurance they provide doesn't cover it, or something else? In my experience most travel insurance I have had as perk of credit cards does not cover cancellations anyway, though some may differ.One thing you need to determine for anything ""bought"" with points or miles is (1) whether the points/miles can be redeposited if you cancel and(2) whether there is a fee for such a redeposit. In my experience with a couple of airlines, miles can be redeposited, though there is a fee for that unless you have elite status. However, I do not know how other programs work (including my own BA Avios points, which I sometimes use for hotels).One thing I look for when I am buying trip insurance myself and have used miles for award travel is a policy that covers redposit fees if I have to cancel and whether insurer has a dollar limit on that.If you do find a policy that covers your trip keep in mind it is unlikely to cover a cancellation due to your just feeling uncomfortable about the situation. There needs to be more, like the State dept.warns against travel there, airlines stop flying there,country you are visiting isn't allowing in people who have previously been in certain other countries, etc. Again, ask the insurer if isn't clear from policy.Good luck."
"As a basin tenet - insurance companies do not cover issues that have already arisen - so my assessment is you canâ€™t insure against consequential issues from covid-19 as it is now a known issue.Do you have insurance and was it taken out before or with the booking (ideally before 2020?)Edited: 2:26 pm, February 16, 2020 "
"Your information says you are from the USA. If so you can compare policies on a site like Insuremytrip.com. But most policies in the USA require you to book within a few days, usually 10-14, from when you make your first payment on the trip. The idea is to discourage people from buying policies later only after an issue comes up. So if you booked the trip a while ago it might be too late to buy travel insurance.Also most policies don't cover the value of the points. You'd be subject to the TOC for the chase points. If there's a fee to recover the points if you cancel then the insurance might cover that.Lastly, there's no coronavirus related travel advisories to either Japan or Vietnam. There's no evidence of an outbreak in either country. Cases there are related to people who had been to China previously, just like in the USA. So if you want to cancel a trip to those countries because of the coronavirus in China, no policy will cover that unless you purchased cancel for any reason coverage, which usually only pays about 75% of what you paid anyway. If the virus gets worse, things could always change, but at this point, flights to those countries, as long as you don't have to travel through China, are operating normally."
"I was booked on Norwegian Jade, which was in the news 2 weeks ago when that family of 8 decided things were too hot in Asia to go, and wanted their $32k back...which they did not get (even though they did have insurance, it had exclusions covering pandemics).Anyway, given the above, and also because Norwegian was, technically, covered by the World Health Organization (WHO) saying that Coronavirus was not a big deal (at least back then), I didn't waste my time asking for a refund. And I do see both sides - the cruise lines, literally, won't see another dime in bookings in Asia, for the next 2 years (at least), so why not take the available cash, particularly when you have a legal case to protect that right. And, on the other side, who am I, a paranoid right-winger who voted for Trump (heaven forbid) to second-guess the experts at WHO (who answers to China)? So, I see their point there also.By the way, that sailing, which left Singapore on Feb 6, never made it to Vietnam (the entire point of the cruise), and was also rejected by Hong Kong as their final destination, is now waiting for permission to dock back at Singapore...passengers who did go wound up with a lot of 'fun days at sea' on that journey.As to me an my wife, we had a cheap cabin...so it's more 'entertainment' to follow their journey than any financial hit."
"The ""travel insurance"" topic goes in circles. No insurance covers anything and everything. As an example, the current medical insurance covers internationally so additionally medical coverage would be pointless (and likely illegal if I actually filed claims with multiple companies). I do purchase additional trip insurance for international travel. The travels are award travel via American Airlines and $28. Prepare for the unexpected. Frankly Vietnam is cheap so another 1-2 weeks shouldn't be a financial hazard but Japan isn't cheap. The to and from doesn't concern me as much as getting stuck in Asia for weeks. The people on the cruise ship went through two weeks of misery only go to through another two weeks of misery. A $200 cancellation fee isn't a concern with the prospects of unplanned weeks away from home and weeks away from work."
"Re #4 - I have never seen a US policy that requires you to buy within 10-14 days of initial trip payment. You can generally buy whenever you want.Any limitations I have seen of that nature (and they have varied from 7-21 days) have been ONLY in policies that offer a waiver of an otherwise applicable pre-existing condition exclusion. In those cases, they waive the exclusion if you buy within the specified period. But it is ONLY for that particular purpose.And keep in mind some plans don't offer a waiver and some plans never had pre-existing condition exclusions to begin with. You have to READ the policy.Not to mention the fact that this isn't even the issue the OP is concerned about.Edited: 2:58 pm, February 16, 2020 "
"One more thing. What we did was hold off our cancellations to the last minute (flights and cruise), in the hope that we might get a full refund, should parts of our itinerary be cancelled. It wound up that the cruise did leave Singapore as planned (and as noted above), but one of our flights, actually for tomorrow, from Hong Kong to Taipei, has been cancelled, as Taiwan is no longer permitting flights from Hong Kong (or they're making them quarantine for 14 days, or whatever). In any case, we did get the full refund for that, as well as another leg.Also, the next sailing for the Norwegian Jade, which is scheduled in about 36 hours from now, is fully cancelled (which makes sense, considering that no one wants them), so those people do get a full refund...but anyone who cancelled before Norwegian announced (last Thursday), my be out that refund.So don't be in any hurry to cancel."
"IMO the comment in #4 that you can't buy most USA travel insurance if it has been 14+ days since your first payment is incorrect. There is often a 14-day rule that works this way: if you buy insurance within 2 weeks of first payment the exclusion for pre-existing conditions is waived, i.e., pre-existing conditions ARE covered; if you buy insurance after 2 weeks of first payment pre-existing conditions are NOT covered. So the 14 days has nothing to do with whether you can or can't buy travel insurance, but rather the amount of coverage you can buy. (There are insurance companies that will cover pre-existing conditions in policies bought 14+ days after first payment, some for an extra fee and others that primarily cover cruises.)"
"@post 7 and 9 I guess i should clarify. You're correct you can buy the policy later but you lose a lot of the benefits. Most of them waive pre-existing conditions if you buy within a 10-14 days of when you make your first payment towards the trip. Also most policies I've used don't cover cancellations due to events that happen before the policy is purchased. Those are huge restrictions. Cancel for any reason insurance, which is what the OP would need, always, at least in my experience, has to be bought within a short time after the first payment is made. This is for obvious reasons. Otherwise people would wait until they had a need to cancel to buy the policy. So for most people buying a policy in the USA you do want to buy it soon after you make a payment for the trip."
"We just recently got an email from our travel insurance company, stating that insurance bought after January 24th will not accept Covid-19 problems as a claim. I read it as like a 'pre-existing condition' now that the virus is in so many places.I would think this will be pretty standard for travel insurance companies now. So getting insurance now even for a trip booked a while ago would possibly not cover any disruptions due to the virus."
". I read it as like a 'pre-existing condition' now that the virus is in so many places.----------Most travel insurance policies will not cover virus epidemics once they have started up. Like life insurance, you have to buy it before there is a real problem, not once the problem exists.I would see it as absolutely impossible to buy insurance now the corona virus. However, many hotels are changing their cancellation policies.I just cancelled a ""non-refundable"" hotel in Taipei and will get all my money refunded.."
"MapleG, had you booked it a few weeks ago? It's only about 3 weeks since we were told. We bought ours in November when we booked our trip, so it seems we're covered.I've seen a few things online where situations like yours- non-refundables- are being refunded. Nice that a bit of consideration is being shown."
"I have been doing CFAR for the last few years for personal reasons, I would only get 80% back, beats a blank, and I did have to purchase the insurance coverage within 8 days of travel bookings.CFAR was worth it to me last year, much more so now.JMO"
"To the OP and maybe other US residents in a similar situation: perhaps the easiest way at this point to find out if you can get coverage is to start an insurance purchase on insuremytrip.com or squaremouth.com. To get a quote on one of those sites you have to enter some key details, like destination, departure date, length of trip, your age, state of residence, date of first trip payment, etc. Prices you are quoted should reflect perceived risk and if nobody offers to sell you a policy of any kind, then that's your answer."
"We have always bought travel insurance the same day we book a flight or tour. This is the type of reason we've done it- and the first time (we have two trips this year) we may have to claim. Once again, it's the saying coming true- 'if you can't afford the insurance, you can't afford the trip'. And definitely should be paid for on the same day."
"I just had a long conversation with AIG travel and they were quite clear that even for deluxe insurance, cancellations made by an airline or cruise or hotel as a result of the virus are not automatically covered. Nor are they denied. In other words, you submit your claim and cross your fingers if you do experience a cancellation. This applies whenever you purchased the insurance (i have a trip booked in May and have not yet purchased insurance.)"
"""I'm reading complaints going back years, and I believe these guys are running a scam and are possibly on even a real insurance company."" - You cannot be suggesting that AIG are not a real insurance company"
<< . I returned from Spain in March ahead of the Corona virus >>The virus has been in Spain since February.
hikerz no need to spam the forums. It will likely end with all your posts being removed.
"I highly doubt any insurance policy purchased now will cover the corona virus pandemic scenario as that is a known threat as of now, let's call it ""pre-existing threat"". When are your flights? Perhaps working with Chase/Airlines to delay your travel is your best course of action."
"'We had to return early, so I cancelled the return flight and took a train to reach my flight in Madrid the 15th of March.' You chose to cancel the flight and travel from Jerez to Madrid by rail.'They also subsequently cancelled my flight by email.' Who are 'they' and which flight did they cancel? Presumably 'they' are IB, but did they cancel the flight from XRY to MAD or reschedule it? Did the flight from MAD to YYZ operate or was it cancelled such that it would never operate?'I was informed by Expedia they handle AIG claims and that although I had insurance I could only get a credit to be used for future travel on Iberia Air.' Given that you changed the ticket and chose to travel by rail rather than take a booked flight sector this may be the correct response by AIG. If the flight from MAD to YYZ operated but you had chosen to book another flight then you're lucky that IB are offering a voucher for future credit.'I'm retired and think I will make this a project to follow-up with the Better Business Bureau and provincial government.' The BBB will thank you and do nothing, and the provincial government have more on their minds right now. 'This is something can kill you, uninsured medical expenses.' Oy. In what way is your having changed flights 'uninsured medical expenses'?"
Hikerz is spamming the forums with his nonsense. Not even the correct forums either (heâ€™s posted on the Tokyo forum). Reported.
"We were booked to Travel to India in April of this year, the policy was bought last year at the time of booking from an independent insurance site, the Visa requirements mean that normally you would apply for a visa 30 Days before you travel, so whilst the UK Government said we were fine to travel in March the Indian Government refused Visas and cancelled wholesale all others which meant we could not travel, we rang the insurance company to be told nope not covered if you cant get a visa to travel we dont cover you, then I dug a lot deeper into the policy, basically they and every single policy I have seen since dont cover for Pandemics or similar unforeseen circumstance! Erm am sorry but i was under the impression I bought insurance not assurance to cover unforeseen circumstances, however what that means in a nutshell as I am trying to insure next years trip at the moment is every single policy is not worth the paper its written on, its a scam and a con because if there is a global pandemic or you travel to an area that is advised you dont at the time the policy is taken out then you have no insurance.Atol or ABTA cover they wash there hands of any responsibility and tell you they need to pay you back which is what happened to us this year still 5k out of pocketAirline goes bust you need to claim via the aboveTravel co goes bust DittoGlobally recognised pandemic no coverNatural disaster no coverluggage lost oh so many hoops and you are advised to claim via your Airline/agentDoctors Bills pay locally and claim back on returnParking reservation sorry not coveredI could go on its a total scam even if bought via the actual travel agent that sold me my Holiday for next year they have the same restrictions and the price has gone through the roof and the covers gone through the floor, plus they have the cheek to claim after making Billions for years that they are in financial straits please give these leeches no more of your cash until they actually provide what we pay them for!"
"Which company are you advising we avoid? I am sure you donâ€™t mean every one, as we have many tales of reimbursements for Covid."
"I have insurance for an upcoming international trip. It does cover Covid. You canâ€™ find policies. I got mine via world nomads, but there are other options. For a domestic trip I actually purchased cancel for any reason insurance. I didnâ€™t need to be covered for Covid while on vacation because my personal insurance will cover that but should there be a lockdown or something I wanted to be able to get my money back"
I have a travel insurance policy that has recently settled my claim as I was covered for both the pandemic and the FCO advice against non essential travel - it was not the cheapest policy that I could have bought but it was the one that met my needs.I suspect that transtastic bought a cheaper policy where many potential claims are not covered - read the policy before buying
"Trancetastic,So did those terms change between you identifying it to be right for your needs and then buying it. You would've checked all of that beforehand, right?"
"To respond no it was not the cheapest and I cant really name and shame as am pursuing with the ombudsman, the policy was a annual multi trip at Â£189.00 for 2 people worldwide excl USA purchased in June 19, paid outright, no the terms did not change the terms are what has always been there but what has changed is the fact we now need to make good on these so called ""insurance"" policys, my main argument is I could not go on my Holiday despite taking all the precautions including buying as it happens a worthless policy, am not covered by the Travel agent because the scheduled flight still ran what prevented me was my visa being cancelled not though my own doing ie criminal or similar reasons yet my insurance does not cover it because its my responsibility to ensure I have a Visa well I did but it was cancelled 3 Days after it was issued, despite having curtailment, cancellation, abandonment etc cover clearly listed, I am a victim of a incident outside my control which is why I buy Insurance, the regulation of these cowboys is poor and they are getting away as per usual with fleecing folks as for world nomads i quote below from there siteCoronavirus (COVID-19) and travel - Need to know before you buyThere is NO COVER available for travel to any country or part of it with a COVID-19 travel ban, and any events that arise when you travel against any FCO government warning advising against all or all but essential travel.Ready to hit the road? Before you buy, check the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) travel warnings and make sure you understand the impact coronavirus (COVID-19) and the associated travel warnings may have on travel insurance coverage.Please go to our FAQs or our latest travel alerts, to read more. When getting a quote, review the policy wording for cover terms, conditions, limits and exclusions. like i said am finding it very hard to get any cover thats worth the paper its written on as far as am aware currently all but non essential travel worldwide is against Foreign office advice so what is the point of the insurance? what happens if you buy a policy the FO says its ok to travel but after a flare up of covid etc revises that advice are you covered? knowing what I do now about how these folks stick to the letter of the document I would say no your not unless you get it in writing which they will not do"
"Cancel for any reason is no longer available but you can bet I will buy it in future, it is however more aimed at the usa"
"So you are saying that the policy didn't change between you buying it and you wanting to make a claim, so it was laid out that you were not covered due to pandemics, and now you are expecting them to pay anyway?I'm sorry but based on what you have posted your expectation seems unrealistic. The policy didn't say ""Cancel for any reason"" is covered, but probably laid out the things that WERE covered. You accepted that. If you had wanted complete coverage then you should have bought a policy (if they are even available) which doesn't have exclusions for pandemics, force majeur and the like.Travel Insurance polices vary and it is VERY important to understand what coverage you are getting before sending them any money. They aren't a charity and WILL stick to the exact terms of the contract with you, often disputing claims when they think they don't have to pay. For this reason I only sometimes buy travel insurance, because the sorts of things that I want to have insured they don't cover, unless i buy an extremely expensive policy."
"That is my whole point or is it too complicated for you to fathom out by now, ALL insurance policies seem to have the same clause BEFORE the Covid 19 pandemic my policy was bought June 19, ALL claim to have cancellation (except if your visa is cancelled or pandemic or natural causes), ALL claim to have abandonment ( except in a pandemic situation or natural causes), ALL claim to have you covered against the unexpected (as long as the unexpected fits in a very narrow box), as a consumer I dont expect to have to leaf through a 36 page document to ensure am not being ripped off, the USA has alternate rules and views hence the any reason cancellation products which we dont seem to have a lot of in the UK and frankly until now many would believe as we did that we would be covered, if it says cancellation cover then thats what we expect to get not some dumbed down condition a through z paragraph rubbish, here in the UK the consumer has more protection than in the USA (unless your dealing with an insurance Co it seems) Insurance companies are just a gamble that something wont go wrong and 80% of the time it does not but when it does I expect to get paid out on what I was led to believe I was coveringSo as of right now because of the clause ""Following the outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19), please check whether the FCO advise against travel to your destination before booking.""no travel insurance is valid if booked right now period, this is the UK the USA may have alternate rules but the quote above is from an any reason cancellation website in the ukAny reason? sort of sets the tone does it not?This is from the same site""Please note, our policies will not cover any claims caused by or relating to Coronavirus, COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-COV-2), any mutation of Coronavirus, COVID-19 or SARs-COV-2 or any pandemic or fear or threat of any the above.

May explain your current predicament.""no travel insurance is valid if booked right now period""Totally incorrect insofar as you can buy policies of all shapes, sizes and prices to cover all manner of elements to varied levels; you'd have to read up on that first though and that's a bummer, right? Correct insofar as travelling under the current FCO advisory would invalidate it."
"""no travel insurance is valid if booked right now period""Not quite, as a 10 second google reveals: https:/â€¦In general terms if you are prepared to pay the premium you can insure anything and even if FCO advice is against travel there are still policies that will cover you.

No I dont and if your telling me you read every line in a insurance policy document then am afraid am not going to believe you as for unpleasant maybe you should take a leaf?Find me a policy that covers me?
"We don't have cancellation for reason insurance in the UK AFAIK. If we do I'd love to know which company/companies offer it.When you take a contract out you should read it first. With insurance it's to make sure you're getting the cover and the levels of cover, with acceptable excesses, to suit your needs. It's just common sense not to enter into a contract without knowing what you're signing up to. Some insurance companies are dealing with C19 claims better than others. Some new policies will only cover from a certain date eg not for travel this weekend, but otherwise it's valid as long as there is no travel advisory in place at date of travel, not date of taking insurance out.There are specialist companies that will cover for travel when there's an advisory in place. People used them when there was an advisory in place for Sharm airport. Whether they'd cover C19 related issues is a different matter though."

"I've not come across a travel insurance in the UK which will cover anyone for having their visa cancelled and therefore unable to fly, or not having got a visa in the first place.I think you are blaming Covid for your insurance not paying out, but it must surely be that because you didn't have a visa that is the reason?"
"""so please tell me why this is not the worlds biggest con they make a song and dance about providing cover but in reality you have no cover if in December when your Holiday is due you still cant travel due to FCO guidelines""No insurance policy covers every circumstance. If you wanted a policy that covered against pandemics you could have easily found one."
"So you don't expect to understand WHAT you are buying before you hand over your money? (Reading what is and isn't covered). Sounds pretty foolish to me. Then to come onto a public internet forum and complain that what you bought that was laid out in a detailed descriptions wasn't what you thought you bought because you don't feel like you should have to educate yourself as to what you buy....Keep digging...If you believe that all insurance that you buy covers you for any eventuality then I would strongly advise you to educate yourself. Insurance ALWAYS contains a long list of what is NOT covered, and this is in every country that I know of. That applies to car, home, life, and travel insurance. I am kind of surprised that you didn't know that.So maybe this is a good learning experience - a life lesson if you like. Whether you think you should have to or not, ALWAYS read the terms and conditions of ANYTHING you buy, especially things like insurance or buying flight tickets from online travel agents, and especially the sections about what is,and isn't covered or any fees. It doesn't take that long when you focus on that part. Caveat Emptor - ""buyer beware"" applies."
"OMG do any of you actually read what your replying too?To repeatI had a visa, I had a 1 year Visa as it happens because we travel a couple of times a year to India my Visa was renewed 3 Days before the Indian Government cancelled all Visas 2 Weeks before we were going), at the time the FCO said we could travel, I was booked with a scheduled Airline not a charter my Hotel etc was booked via a Travel Agent as was my flight, the Agent has Abta and ATOL cover.The Scheduled flight was still running when we were due to goThe Hotel was open when we were due to doThe Visa was cancelled My Insurance would not pay out and I will quote ""because it is my responsibility to ensure I could travel"" The Travel agent cant do anything because at the time had we a valid visa we could have gone and yes you guessed it our terms and conditions say you must have appropriate insurance (thought we did) and you must ensure you have a valid Visa to travel( we did )Maybe now my frustration becomes clear?"

"<< OMG do any of you actually read what your replying too? >>Well, maybe if you used some capitalization and punctuation, especially periods, it would be a lot easier for people to understand what you are trying to say! I gave up trying to follow your rants.As others have said, there's no policy that will cover everything and everyone's individual situations. Who would have predicted a pandemic, which a lot of people are finding they are not covered for? TBH, it's not something most people would think to check for as we haven't had one since 1918, which means most of us are too young to even remember that. While it is not your fault that your Visa was cancelled, it's not the insurance company's fault either. If your policy didn't specifically cover the circumstances (cancelled Visa, no unnecessary travel advisories, etc.) then it's not surprising the insurance company will not pay out. Hard and expensive lesson to learn, but I don't see it being a scam or a con. Next time check all of the fine print before buying, even if it means having to read 36 pages!"
"""No you cannot I have looked at my older policy Docs and the SAME clause has been added since the Ebola and MERs outbreak to them all""I don't know what companies you are looking at but many, if not most, mainstream UK travel insurers will pay out for trips that are cancelled due to corona virus."
you have no idea what your talking about
"You don't need to take my word for, below is a list compiled by MSE which outlines what different companies cover. As you can see, most will reimburse you if FCO advices against travel to your destination due to corona virus. https:/â€¦insurers"
"My annual policy covers me for covid cancellations provided the trip was booked before 28 March.When I renewed the policy this month, they took a note of all my trips booked before this date and confirmed in the event I cant travel due to covid/FCO advice Iâ€™m still covered.Not all policies are the same.In your earlier posts it sounded like you didn't get a visa. Were you clear with your insurer and hopefully the ombudsman.What does your policy say about being unable to travel fue to FCO advice?Mine covers me if i cant travel due to FCO advice. Were i to ignore that advice and travel then my policy would be invalid and i wouldn't be covered for anything."
"""the odds are stacked way too high in the insurance sides favour""Yes, of course. So why did you buy a policy? It's not like these highly restrictive terms and conditions are hidden - they are there for anyone to read when they take out the contract. They aren't a charity, they aren't there to be kind, compassionate or ""fair"", beyond sticking to the letter of the contract that you agreed to when you bought the policy.Just because something ""isn't your fault"" does not automatically put it in the scope of your insurance contract to cover.I repeat what I said earlier - your expectations as to what an insurance policy is and isn't are unrealistic.This whole pandemic has exposed many examples of unfairness in the system - these are extraordinary circumstances and many are losing because of it. I have had an insurance claim denied because of it - they stuck to the exact wording of the contract that I agreed to. I am out several thousand dollars as a result of this. I will in future, be looking for a policy which covers this sort of thing in future, if possible. But I'm not faulting the insurance company for sticking to the letter of the contract I agreed to."
"At the end of the day insurance companies are there to make money. They do this by providing a product which provides a customer with a set of defined benefits in return for the fee payable. If they have calculated the odds correctly, then they will pay out less than they take in. If, on the other, they have miscalculated then they could easily go bankrupt and be unable to pay anything after that point.Maybe that's what's really meant by the odds are stacked in favour of the insurance companies.Where things tend to go wrong is when people make assumptions about what they will get under what circumstances, instead of thoroughly checking it out. Then, when they realise that they aren't covered for this or that, they make a big fuss and start using words like scam, fraud, cheats and thieves.>>>Just because something ""isn't your fault"" does not automatically put it in the scope of your insurance contract to cover.<<<I completely agree. The purpose of insurance is not to cover absolutely everything. Very few people expected a global pandemic of such severity as we're enduring. I don't blame those who weren't concerned about such coverage when they chose their insurance, but neither should anyone blame the insurance companies if coverage was excluded."
"Oh Boy maybe its me but when I uy insurance that says ""cancellation, curtailment,"" I expect if I have to cancel due to unexpected reasons ( hence the insurance) they will honour this, when a clause is buried in the small print that effectivly gives the insurance company an out for ALL pandemics BEFORE that pandemic has been alerted or started then i class that as unfair, I class it as being too highly biased towards the provider, lets say you have an Accident on the way to work and then discover a clause that says if you have a dirty car your not covered that would be unfair, cars get dirty, people get ill and unfortunately we as a society have new illnesses developing all the Time, I have been going to India for almost 15 Years and always buy insurance online where possible as its easier so I have a copy of my old Docs, not all polices are from the same Company yet without fail each one when closely examined since the Ebola and SARS/MERS out break states no cover in the event of a pandemic, tell me how do i insure against that without spending more than I did on the Holiday, the answer is you cant, even the ones who claim they DO cover have a disclaimer to say they dont, that is unfair and in my opinion special notice should be called to these clauses which are very well hidden.I had a visa so I did what i needed to do it was cancelled that is not my fault I class that as an unavoidable action by the Indian Government, my Scheduled flight still flew again how was I supposed to use it with no Visa, its just blatantly unfair and frankly the Insurance companys will continue to rake in Billions each year whilst wriggling out of payouts because people like those who have come along and said its acceptable to act in the way they have been to a lot of folks keep handing over the money for them to profit even moreThats it am not bothering anymore I will take my complaint to the ombudsman with the thousands of others who have met the same response from these thievesEdited: 11:11 am, June 24, 2020 "
"I guess that American insurance is very different to the UK, Europe and Australia, since we simply wouldn't expect to be covered for everything. It is a well known fact that they will not cover you if your visa is cancelled, or you forgot to get one or if you get denied entry into a country - well known to most serious travellers anyway.Insurance companies, like all companies, have to make their money somewhere, and obviously mostly rely on people not making claims. Perhaps they also rely on a number of people not actually reading the small print. And since most people probably never make a claim in their lifetime of travelling, they will be the ones who are confident they're covered, probably haven't read the small print and don't keep a check on what their Foreign Office is saying about travel, they are rather blasÃ© about insurance covering them.If you were in the UK and take them to court, I'm certain you wouldn't win. I don't know about the US to pass judgment, but good luck anyway as you'll need it, as I'm rather cynical you have a case."
"Trancetastic, you have just discovered that life is not fair. I didn't sign up for the restrictions imposed on us all, I can't travel or take a holiday worth bothering with, we are all just having to deal with it. Who can I sue ? You could try your luck suing the Indian government for cancelling the visa, the Chinese government for failing to contain the virus, or the UK insurance market for failing to predict a global pandemic. It could be worse ... you could have been allowed to travel and ended up in ICU in India with Covid 19. Basically a global pandemic is an unpredictable Act of God ( And I've always mistrusted his sense of humour) so unlikely to be covered by any standard travel insurance policy."
"Well I'm sorry I got that bit wrong, it must be because of the way it read. I thought trancetastic was from the US!"
"If your windshield was SO dirty you couldnt see through it and you didn't clean it and had an accident, yeah, I expect your insurer might say you are responsible"
"Ooooo -I love these I say ""Potato and you say Potato."" ""Math v Maths (contraction of mathematics) ""US versus standard English moments Northern traveller - in the UK windshields are called windscreens , hoods are bonnets and the trunk of a car is its boot!

I love pedantics....
"My husband is a psychology lecturer and he bought one of these ""pedant"" T-shirts (which has a deliberate misspelling on it ) that he uses as an icebreaker when meeting new student groups - at a random moment he asks them to spot what is wrong with his T-shirt and says it is amazing how many have to read it several times over before they get it and some never do !Edited: 1:03 pm, June 24, 2020 "
"Well, apparently you left the discussion, but still:""Oh Boy maybe its me but when I uy insurance that says ""cancellation, curtailment,"" I expect if I have to cancel due to unexpected reasons ( hence the insurance) they will honour this""If the contract that you signed says that then yes, that is a reasonable expectation. If there are clauses in it that have unacceptable exceptions then you shouldn't buy it. It really is that simple."" when a clause is buried in the small print that effectivly gives the insurance company an out for ALL pandemics BEFORE that pandemic has been alerted or started then i class that as unfair,""Maybe but you agreed to it. Why did you agree to something that you consider so unfair? ""I class it as being too highly biased towards the provider, lets say you have an Accident on the way to work and then discover a clause that says if you have a dirty car your not covered that would be unfair, ""It's neither fair nor unfair - it's not a contract I would sign.""yet without fail each one when closely examined since the Ebola and SARS/MERS out break states no cover in the event of a pandemic""Yes that is typical - so they didn't just capriciously add this in for COVID-19. It's been there for a while.""tell me how do i insure against that without spending more than I did on the Holiday, the answer is you cant""Correct, so we have to set our expectations accordingly."" even the ones who claim they DO cover have a disclaimer to say they dont, that is unfair and in my opinion special notice should be called to these clauses which are very well hidden.""If they are written in plain language in the contract you agreed to then they aren't at ALL hidden.""Thats it am not bothering anymore I will take my complaint to the ombudsman with the thousands of others who have met the same response from these thieves""Good luck. This is contract law which I know differs from country to country, but I am guessing that no court is going to support the idea that something you agreed to is ""unfair"" and should therefore be ignored.But good luck on your quest."
