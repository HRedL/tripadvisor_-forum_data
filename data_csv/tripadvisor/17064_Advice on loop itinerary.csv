"We will be potentially flying into and out of Durango at the beginning of Sept. We are thinking 2 nights in Durango, 2 in Ouray, and 2 in Moab and then go to Mesa Verda on the way back to Durango for the last night since we have an early flight the next morning. One thought is from Ouray whether to go to Black Canyon of the Gunnison NP and then on to Moab or go to Telluride for a half day and on to Moab from there. Any and all advice would be appreciated. Thank you"
"I would do Black Canyon. Telluride is beautiful, but fairly similar to Ouray in geography."
"Welcome to the Colorado forums. I would for sure drop the stop in Mesa Verde. With the COVID closures, there's not as much value given that you can't see the primary sites. You'll get far more benefit out of another night in Moab. From Ouray, if you add in Black Canyon you'll dramatically impact your time in Moab. It's the opposite direction. If you feel you need to add something, Telluride makes more sense. While the mountains are the same as Ouray, the town is completely different. But I feel you'll get way more out additional time in Moab.Do pay attention to COVID restrictions which are likely to change before you go in September.Have fun."
Thank you both very much. Yes COVID restrictions are big concerns. We have had two trips cancelled so we are really hoping this will work out. Thanks again!
"I'm going to give the opposite advice of tumbleweed. Telluride is a lovely town but it's a town, not anything like the magnificent Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. Here are the reviews on tripadvisor -https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Revieâ€¦And while the main tours of the ruins at Mesa Verde NP are not open you can get great views of them from some overlooks and there are so many other things to see there. Don't miss out on a World Heritage site to spend a day in Telluride or in Moab, imho. One day in Arches is sufficient - I've been multiple times and drive from my home in CO and drive home all in the same day. Hope whatever you do that you have a great visit. Stay safe."
"While Coloradans are under no non essential travel mandates, tourists continue to pour into Durango. Downtown is packed with people, campgrounds are at full capacity, mask mandates are not being enforced , grocery stores are being depleted by tourists of goods locals need and covid continues to rise here. Durango has a small hospital and very limited medical care. This is nothing personal, but why do people think it is wise to vacation during a global epidemic? There is growing resentment among locals towards tourists who continue to arrive here from high infection states. NM has a mandatory 14 day quarantine, and many people hope that Colorado will do this too. Doubtful though. Be safe."
Please stay in your own state until the epidemic calms down. Not the time to travel.
