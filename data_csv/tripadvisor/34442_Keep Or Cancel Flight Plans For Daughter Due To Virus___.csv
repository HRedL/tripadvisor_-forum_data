"My 15 year old Daughter is scheduled to fly for her very first time in two weeks. She'll be visiting her best friend, and she's really looking forward to going. She'll be flying out of Newark, NJ, to Raleigh, NC. I've been going back and forth about whether it's safe, or too risky, and if I should keep her flight. There's been nothing on the news about flying within the US, and if it's still safe with this virus spreading. I can't even get masks for her,they're sold out everywhere. Can anyone offer some advice/opinions on this? I still have time to cancel, but I'll most likely lose the $200 I paid for tickets."
There have only been seven reported cases in the US. It is perfectly safe to fly from NJ to NC.
"Most masks people are wearing are absolutely worthless. Your daughter would be better off just washing her hands well. I would not cancel this flight, I see no reason why it's ""risky."""
Has she had her flu shot yet? That's the big concern with the ongoing flu season in the US.
You wear a mask if you are contagious not to prevent getting sick.
"Some perspective is in order. It's a two hour flight, add to that time in the airports at both ends and that's about four and a half hours in airports and on planes.Presumably your daughter goes to school, to the shops, sees her friends, and goes to restaurants, the cinema and more. She is as likely to run into someone affected by nCoV at any of those places as she is at an airport or on the plane. Would you deem it appropriate to wear an N95 mask every day for the next four or five weeks?Miss dmor should ensure good hand hygiene whilst travelling as she would every day. Hopefully all will go well for her."
I can’t see any reason to cancel for that route.
"Agree that the flu and a stomach virus that is hitting schools in our area very hard (lots of mulitple-day closures) are more of a threat at this point than the Corona virus, especially when just flying from NJ to NC. Lots of us, including me, will be continuing with our flights to locations both inside the US and internationally. We will maybe take more precautions about cleaning hard surfaces in the plane and making sure we wash our hands a little more frequently, but I am not nervous about flying at this time."
"Nearly 10,000 Americans have died in the US this winter from the regular flu.Being concerned about the Coronavirus is similar to being afraid of her getting hit by a meteorite.And the masks that you and I can buy do ZERO towards protecting your or me from a virus. It does help someone who HAS the virus spread it less by containing their breath.Edited: 1:42 pm, February 02, 2020 "
"If you can, I would wait just a bit longer to see how things go here in US -- maybe a week if possible.NYC has been monitoring 5 people. Test results have come back negative for one, so presumably that person is no longer being monitored. The last person is a Chinese tourist who was taken from a Manhattan hotel to a hospital yesterday or the day before. This could just be seasonal flu or a cold. But if it were the coronavirus I might be concerned about where that tourist had been, what airport he or she came into. I live in midtown near a Chinese restaurant that seems to cater almost exclusively to Chinese tour groups who arrive by bus. From the opposite side of the street yesterday I saw a group outside this place. This surprised me as I thought China had banned outgoing tour groups at least a week ago. Howver this could have been a group that left China before the ban OR it could not have been a group at all, just some individuals. In any eve this should no longer be an issue as of this evening as visitors from China are being bannd."
"Another thing, and not exactly on point, but with all this talk about ""all you have to do is wash your hands frequently with warm water and soap,"" it would be nice if there really were warm water and soap outside one's own home. At a lot of the places I go in NYC -- museums, cinemas, stores, airports and other transit hubs, etc. -- I often can't get more than a quick dribble of cold water, sometimes a little soap, sometimes not, and rarely hot or warm water. So maybe the Mayor and health commissioner need to do a bit more than just exhort us to wash our hands.Edited: 3:35 pm, February 02, 2020 "
https:/…I don't want to sound alarmist but I think you really need to keep an eye on this
"I agree with all the others dmor2015- yours is a total over-reaction on an epic scale. There is no need for her to wear face masks on the plane, in the airport nor indeed anywhere else if the poor child is not even leaving the USA. She is less likely to come into contact with this virus on her planned trip than of catching the flu and dying from that, being run over by a bus or coming into contact with a rogue gunman at school TBH I could not believe what I was reading when I read the original post. What on earth does your daughter think of what I am afraid I feel is your hysterical reaction to what is going on in China? What do her father and/or other close relatives think of your violent reaction about this? Have you even spoken to your doctor for reassurance about the risks ? I really feel that you need to calm down and let the poor kid go on her trip as planned - she will be fineEdited: 3:59 pm, February 02, 2020 "
"Since the NY Times is reporting this afternoon that infectious disease specialists across the world now expect a global pandemic I think it at least makes sense to monitor what is going on and arm her daughter with some purell or wipes or something before she faces Newark Airport, which I expect would be the greatest germ challenge of her trip.Newark was one of the last airports to start screening incoming China passengers for this virus, and it is the first airport that many passengers from countries likely to be hardest hit by a pandemic arrive (poor countries in Africa, Asia and other underdeveloped parts of the world with weak or nonexistent public health systems).Furthermore, I would not count on Newark Airport, or any other NYC airport to have what I needed to adequately clean my hands (hot water, soap). All the more reason to pack lots of hand sanitizer if she does go. (Personally, I would also pack some gloves, if only the cheap nitrile ones you get at Home Depot for painting)."
"The WHO's report as of today, 2 February https:/… The last paragraph on page seven and the recommendations above it are worth a look."
"You're this bothered about an utterly infinitesimal risk from Coronavirus (with a 2% mortality rate among mainly old people), and not at all bothered by the possibility of ANYTHING else, which is about 100,000 times more likely?Is this actually a troll post, because if not there's some serious risk vs reality delusion that needs addressing for your own peace of mind.Edited: 4:54 pm, February 02, 2020 "
#15 Lovely to know how certain you are about the fatality rate for this virus. I suggest you ring up the researchers in the NY Times story linked in #11 and share your expert opinion with them. I'm sure it will be a great relief to them to know that even if they are having trouble getting a grip on it there's Elle down in Australia who knows.
">>>The WHO's report as of today, 2 February https:/… The last paragraph on page seven and the recommendations above it are worth a look.<<<From the linked site:RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE FOR THE PUBLICDuring previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and SevereAcute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact andfomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The basic principles to reducethe general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections include the following:• Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.• Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.• Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals.• People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, covercoughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).• Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially inemergency departments.WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratoryillness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel historywith their healthcare provider."
"I suggest you read your own link, QQ2 as the mortality rate I quoted is FROM it :-)""The mortality rate for known cases of the Wuhan coronavirus has been running about 2 percent, although that is likely to drop as more tests are done and more mild cases are found.""I don't live anywhere near Australia, by the way.Edited: 5:29 pm, February 02, 2020 "

"Aussie Elle: But they make it very clear they haven't yet come up with something definite. Personally, in times like these I think it makes sense to at least try to restrain one's big aussie mouth, no matter how proud one is of it and let the experts do the work."
"QQ2 please stop. You told me off for quoting a 'fake' statistic that was from a story you posted a link to and obviously hadn't read thoroughly.I think it's possibly yourself that needs restraint.The remark about a 'big Aussie mouth' is rude and uncalled for. I'm not Australian but I'm happy to be offended on their behalf.Edited: 5:43 pm, February 02, 2020 "
"QQ2: given your hysterical reaction to this event, I am surprised that you would even get out of your house during the flu season. Now I don't know the statistics for US but I suppose they are very close to the Canadian stats. In Canada every year about 13000 people people get flue and 3500 people die. Compare that to the coronavirus. So far about 140000 people sick and just about 300 deaths.As for OPs daughter, she is at more risk of getting affected by her normal daily activities than getting exposed to corona virus on a plane during a 2 hour internal flight.Edited: 5:52 pm, February 02, 2020 "
"QQ2, Why do you think Elle is an Aussie ? Have you never heard of the English town of Melbourne? and comments about a big Aussie mouth are just offensive.I find it difficult to believe that you can’t find hot water for hand washing in museums, cinemas, stores, airports etc in NYC. The USA is supposed to be a first world country, surely you cannot be serious? Pretty much every public toilet / washroom in the UK and Europe, in stations, pubs, petrol stations, motorway services etc etc provides such basic facilities. I would have expected better."
"On reflection, QQ2 if your hand washing facilities are so inadequate, perhaps that accounts in part for the spread of the common flu virus in the US. However, I have often been shocked by the behaviour of people even in upmarket offices, restaurants and other public places who don’t bother to wash their hands."
"Post 20 is especially offensive, both to Elle and all Aussies.A surprise (to me at least) from a usually helpful poster and logical poster. Clearly coronavirus and a lack of hot water (yes, it's always been a puzzle to me as a not infrequent USA visitor the lack in public washrooms in many places) seem to have hit a raw nerve.And I happen to be well aware that Elle resides in the Northern Hemisphere where she too is a helpful TA member, and is not known for posting flights of fancy.SWT"
"To be fair re hand-washing, I always travel with hand sanitiser and wipes. You never know when you'll have to touch some nasty surface, and I had treatment for heart failure recently, so I'm paranoid about picking up germs.Also really handy when flying, so you can clean your tray table/arm rests etc as previously mentioned.Not to mention the entertainment remote - those things are filthy!Edited to say thanks and hi to SWT - just saw your post.Edited: 6:09 pm, February 02, 2020 "
"Lavinium, your numbers are correct but one label is off. About 13,000 people in Canada get hospitalized for flu and 3500 die (27%, yikes!). The majority of people who get influenza just moan and whine and feel terrible for days or even weeks but are not hospitalized. A typical estimate is 10% of people get influenza in a typical year so about 3.7 million people in Canada. A lot of mortality and a lot of suffering. You don't want to hear about my influenza from 3 years ago? No? No one does."

"I get that some people think this is the beginning of the end of days. The media reports are certainly fuelling that. I apologise if my original post seemed dismissive.But it would be a shame if the OP's 15 year old daughter didn't get to see her best friend when the chance of Coronavirus is likely incredibly small in her location at this time.I think about 80,000 people died of 'regular' flu in the US last year if that puts anything in perspective.Edited: 6:54 pm, February 02, 2020 "
"Should the OP really want a few masks just in case. Unlike surgical masks, N-95 rated masks supposedly provide some protection. Stores like Home Depot and Lowe’s carry them. Stores near us here in MD still have them in stock. Don’t know about the situation in the OP’s locale."
"#27: my bad, I should have said 13000 hospitalized for flu every year in Canada with 3500 deaths. Compare that to 14000 hospitalized for coronavirus so far worldwide with 300+ dead."
"I caught a flight from London Heathrow a few days ago. There were quite a few Americans wearing masks, including families with children wearing masks but the adults weren’t. All were flying within Europe. The key thing (for me) was that all the ones I saw removed the masks to eat/talk/drink. So what was the point? Most of the masks were the flimsy white sort worn too loosely to be of any use anyway. I wonder what the OP thinks her daughter will do once she’s out of sight of her Mother. Has she told her daughter to wear it whilst she snacks or drinks on the plane or to avoid food and drink?"
I just saw Post 20 by QQ2 too and was shocked at how rude it was. TBH I am surprised it has not been reported and removed as a personal attack /harassment
"And, for the record, while “pandemic” is a scary word all it means is that the disease is on more than one continent. The flu is a pandemic, and we’re not all panicked about the flu. Being a “pandemic” tells you nothing about how contagious or how fatal a disease is. I’m still flying weekly, domestically. Masks don’t help uninfected people: they’re only useful for keeping infected people from spreading it. There’s zero reason to cancel domestic plans. I hope your daughter enjoys her trip."
I will delete my post #29 as the missing posts have been re-instated. Thank you to whoever requested that as their removal made the other posts difficult to understand.
"@dmor2015I personally see no risk any different from a year ago for such a travel.When I write this there are 11 cases in the USA. 11 out of around 17000. Nobody died.The face masks people are wearing have no effect against any virus. To me the biggest advantage is that people to not touch their mouth with their fingers.She is flying from Newark to Raleigh. ""She's really looking forward to going."" So let her go. Nothing has really changed.People tend to be afraid of new risks and forget the ""old"" risks. Please put things into perspective. Maybe have a look at some ""old"" risks in teh USA, we all just have learned to accept and forget:- 40,000 people killed by road accidents per year => avg. 110 per day.- 18,000 intentional homicide per year => 49 per day- 430,000 rapes per year => 49 per hour / 0.8 per minute- 51 people killed by lightning strikesWhat I am trying to tell you is, that the coronavirus is new and we are rather scared from new things than from things we know well. But, again, every day 110 people get killed by road accidents.At the end of the day, your children grow up and live their own life. You should let them slowly prepare for this. You are unable to protect them from everything in life.In short: let her travel. She will be thankful."
Great post Phil.
"<< I think about 80,000 people died of 'regular' flu in the US last year >>NO, that is not correct. According to the CDC"" CDC estimates that influenza was associated with more than 35.5 million illnesses, more than 16.5 million medical visits, 490,600 hospitalizations, and 34,200 deaths during the 2018–2019 influenza season. ""So far it is about 8200 in the 2019-2020 season. Still a very significant number put not 10 times what was mentioned here.There always have been and always will be risks to our well-being. Some are everyday things and others are things like the Corona virus, but we can only do so much to avoid the risks. Take the recommended precautions to minimize your risks, but some people are going overboard here, much of it fueled by the constant and instantaneous news reports that we just didn't have during the SARS outbreak in 2003. I don't recall everyone getting this crazy back then."
"Why does this report give such a different number for 2018 (80,000)? The number appears to be from the CDC. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/26/80000-people…Edited: 12:15 pm, February 03, 2020 "
"The excerpt I posted above came form the CDC website below. Where news outlets get their info is anyone's guess. While it is difficult to get exact numbers, I doubt that that CDC has underestimated the deaths by more than half of the 80000 mentioned above. https:/…2018-2019.html"
"You are comparing two different years - the 2017/2018 had almost twice as means deaths as the 2018/2019 flu season. At one point in December 2018 the CDC was estimating close to 80K deaths in 2017/2018 as you can see from this excerpt from the CDC website:Can you explain why the estimates on this page are different from previously published and reported estimates for 2017-2018? (For example, total flu-related deaths during 2017-2018 was previously estimated to be 79,000, but the current estimate is 61,000)?The estimates on this page have been updated from an earlier report published in December 2018 based on more recently available information. There is a trade-off between timeliness and accuracy of the burden estimates. To provide timely burden estimates to the public, clinicians, and public health decision-makers, we use preliminary data that may lead to over- or under-estimates of the true burden. However, each season’s estimates will be finalized when data on testing practices and deaths for that season are available."
"Whatever the figures, they put the likelihood of catching and then dying of influenza far higher for this young lady if she is allowed to go on her trip than of her being infected with the Wuhan corona virus. Let the poor kid have her trip, be glad for her and plan a great welcome home treat for when she returns home safely as she undoubtedly willAs a mother myself I can only see NOT allowing her to travel as planned when there is clearly minimal risk of anything going wrong as a very fast way to unnecessarily create really bad feeling between the young person and her parents. These days 15 year olds are no longer ""children"" (whether you choose to treat them as such or not) your daughter is looking forward to her first solo ""adult"" trip (albeit to stay with a friend so not that ""solo"") - what is she going to think if an over protective parent changes their mind and says ""no"" because of a perceived risk which is so minimal as to be not worth worrying about and spoils all her fun ? She may be so young as to have to bow to parental rules, but the resentment caused by cancelling the trip unnecessarily could damage the relationship irretrievably - handling the transition from child to young adult is hard enough for both generations anyway, but IMO in circumstances like this one the parents have far more to lose than the cost of the unused airline tickets by being heavy handed - creating a resentful teen (and in this case I think she would have every right to be resentful of such a knee jerk reaction by her parents) by being over protective when she is on the cusp of adulthood is foolish if you want to develop a great adult relationship with a young woman who you clearly care so much aboutEdited: 1:34 pm, February 03, 2020 "
