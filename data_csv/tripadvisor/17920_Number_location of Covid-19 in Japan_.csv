I have a Tokyo booked trip with my young family for 12 days from 6-Apr (from Australia). Is anyone able to find or know the current numbers of covid-19 in Japan (excluding the contained cruiseships) / locations / backstory on how they got it? At this stage we are still going but would like to get more data to keep myself informed in case we cancel. Thanks for your help.

I should've put https://www. before it.You got the right link and if you scroll downthey have the number chart on it.
"Japan is now at 85 diagnosed asides from the cruise ship. The most recent cases have not been tied to China, but instead Japanese transmitting to Japanese.Latest report: https:/…"
Backstory on some of the recent cases: https:/…044000chttps:/…012000c
Here is a new good one (Japanese):https:/…641eba7fef234a47880e1e1dc4de85ce
Can you open this? https:/…
Thank you everyone. All these links have very good information. All the best. FeFe
"Rather than the number, the quality changed. It is no longer Chinese connection, but anybody can be a carrier.Even 80 percent will be just be like a longer cold, if you have chronic disease it can get critical."
Japan is now Watch Level 1 per CDC:https:/…coronavirus-japanOp still have lots of time. Just have to see how it goes.
"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/we're also scheduled to arrive in Japan on April 1st. the # is relatively low though new cases are trending up in low teen. we'll closely monitor the spreading/new cases, and diff measure of precaution will be used. right now just mask and avoid busy area/interacting with others if possible."
"You should cancel immediately. I’m Japanese and live in Tokyo. I can’t say Japanese government control this situation appropriately. One professor make a comment on the tv program, “I assume there are i ver 10 thousands of hiding infected people”. It is true there are many people who have symptoms like covid but being refused to take tests, and also who have fever but still go to work and of course they use public transportation."
New positives has been reported every few hours in the last few days.https:/…This is the start of it (or end of it).
"Fefe, I was supposed to be going with my young kids as well and we just canceled. There’s absolutely no point in going. All events have been canceled. We had tickets for museums, shows and all are now canceled. And if you didn’t know, the travel alert is on level two. I would never take a chance at this point. I would strongly suggest rescheduling."
Here's another website which I think is quite informative on the latest updates worldwide:https://thewuhanvirus.com
"Do you have travel insurance that covers cancellation? What have you decided to do? We also also a young family meant to be travelling April 6-26th. We’ve contacted our travel insurance, credit card insurance etc, and epidemics like this are not covered, and we are up to loosing a lot of money if we cancel.... due to the scale of this , I think it’s absolutely unreasonable that travel insurance won’t cover it!"
"Hi Cara M, i tried to claim travel insurance before the smart traveller change to level 2 and they rejected. We are also planning to go on 6 Apr but we are cancelling as we have a baby and 5yo, too scared of getting sick or to be quarantined. Not sure if anyone has any luck with travel ins claim?"

"Hi Elizabeth. We also have a 1year old, and I'm very concerned. But we will loose so much money which makes it very difficult! Do you loose all your money? I believe its unfair that we can't get insurance to cover this epidemic."
@Fefe. Someone posted this website in another thread. https://covid19japan.com shows the breakdown of the affected prefectures in Japan. Hope it helps.
"Hi Cara M, the insurance told me if the smart traveller change to level 3 or 4 they will pay cancellation. At this stage we are loosing our flights cost as its non refundable and we bought it last year. Luckily i can still cancel my accommodation booking. Although our parents bought the non cancellable hotels so they are loosing everything. Sigh..why this is happening..not even sure when we can go again. I am also hoping insurance will pay the cancellation."
"Not sure if this is what you’re looking for, but this site lists areas where the outbreaks originated in Japan.Edited: 2:29 am, February 25, 2020 "

"""Number/location of Covid-19 in Japan""  ""breakdown of the affected prefectures in Japan""there are some japanese sites/maps showing prefecture-by-prefecture number of coronavirus cases, but they are often a mere reflection of the number of testing conducted by each prefecture rather than virus’s actual spread.for example, there are only a few confirmed cases in extremely touristy Kyoto/Nara area which was visited by millions of chinese tourists over the past few months alone. Very odd.according to news reports yesterday, only 37 people had been tested by Feb.21 in Kyoto prefecture, while the number was mere 21 in Nara It seems local authorities and/or hospitals in these places are not enthusiastic about the testing, probably. Meanwhile, much less touristry Wakayama prefecture in the same Kansai region has already tested nearly a thousand people. No wonder the confirmed cases in wakayama is larger than that of touristy Kyoto/Nara. I also wish to note that there are a few japanese who had tested positive/hospitalised just after returning from their stay in supposedly safer countries such as the US and France."
"U guys are great with info & advice. We have decided to cancel our Tokyo trip now that travel alert is raised to L2. Its so stressful making this decision. Losing out $financially is the biggest thing on my mind, but I think better to avoid risk altogether or we may end up paying for it more ways than one. Everyone is in the same boat so I dont feel alone with the financial loss & the airlines etc are suffering too so the cancellation fees we pay is only barely helping them keep afloat down the track. I dont think we will reschedule as i might be paying $500 to again cancel end of year. Im going make some enquiries via the airline reseller ;o on Friday.. ask abt credit?/poss to change destination?/Otherwise full cancellation. My hotel allows cancellation thank gawd.."
"One more thing.. our decision was based on the alert level rise from 1 to 2. Young family & my health. If u still go, u will be so lucky with less crowds and Im so jealous. Keep safe though. fefe"
Here's an excellent article. https:/…
"The post from Kanazawan must be the one that's deleted. Meanwhile..... there's a US military personal that's been diagnosed as positive in South Korea. There were 2 people from Nagoya who came back from Hawaii and tested positive. (Hawaii is looking for connections.) They happened to go to gym which is affiliated to mine, so it's a ""big deal"" for my fitness friends, even though we are hundreds of kilometers apart. BTW, our gym was VERY empty today! People must be trying to stay AWAY from others!"
This explains about how it’s spreading now after Japan failed miserably with the cruise ship. https:/…
"Install NHK World - Japan app, at the Japan news got updated daily."
"I am flying 3/2 with Delta to Narita. Since the CDC alert is only level 2, I am subject to cancellation fees.I will continue to monitor.Be safe, stay warm, practice good hygiene and use common sense above all! Looking forward to my second trip to Tokyo and Kyoto- it is a spectacular country!"
"Hi Everyone!They have high numbers of COVID-19 mostly because of the cruise ship. I am planning a visit there over the March break. The WHO just had a conference today and said that the virus is mostly passed by symptomatic humans. So, life must go on. I will be bringing antibac wipes, and hand sanitizer, and washer my hands a lot. I have masks. However unless someone sneezes in your face or my only fear in my food, you should be able to keep it at bay. Just don't touch your face. That's how it gets in. May you all stay healthy and happy!"
"I'm also planning to fly to Tokyo next Friday. My worry is that recent cases in Asia like Indonesia, come from a Japanese ... but I don't know which city the person come from :("
Vinamelody... I understand your concern. A woman from Australia was diagnosed with corona after returning from her vacation in Japan. People in public have it but aren’t being tested so just exercise caution when you’re here.
"(Apologies if this has been posted already). Still looking for cases by prefecture? Try this: Infections by prefecture, March 2nd update https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-data/h00657/…"
"As I wrote last month https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29818… , the problem with prefectural data is that some places (such as super-touristy Kyot@) has done VERY LITTLE testing for the coronavirus while some others (such as not-so-touristy Wakayama in the same Kansai region) has been testing as MANY people as possible. HUGE difference in local authorities' attitudes/number of testing from place to place within Japan. No one believes that a place like Kyot@, which was visited by millions of mainland chinese over the past few months, has only a few COVID-19 cases, in reality.Edited: 10:29 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"And, I wish to add again that there are several japanese who had tested positive/hospitalised after returning from their stay in supposedly safer countries such as the US and France. I wouldn't do any internaional travels for a while."
Japan Times reported that less than 11K tests were conducted b/w 18-28th Feb (in Japan) - so roughly 1K tests daily in that period.https:/….Xl9cQkBuLVi
