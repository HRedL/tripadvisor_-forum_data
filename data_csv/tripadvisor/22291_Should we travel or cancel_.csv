"We’re supposed to fly from MN to Fort Myers beach/Cape Coral in a couple weeks. We’re worried that with the high Covid numbers, not much will be open and that we will be limited on things we can do. We’re mainly just looking for time at the beach and some meals in restaurants. Does that seem likely to still happen? Thanks in advance."
"I don't think anyone can answer your question. Lee County has been unwilling to even mandate the wearing of masks, so, things will probably have to get much worse here before they would close anything. Although, the state has closed bars.Lee County had a record number of cases today. Fort Myers Beach itself has had only 45 cases reported (in total) , i'm not sure how many people live there."
"I think i misspoke above. Lee County didn't have a record number of cases yesterday, they had a record number of deaths, 15."
"We are in FMB now, since Sat. Weekends are busier than weekdays. We are staying at the Pink Shell so could be different for you. Beach seems to be less busy than the pool. We only ventured off property yesterday evening for dinner (Salty Crab), and today we spent most the day in Time Square (Pierside Grill, smokin oyster brewery, then sunset beach grill, during the day and then (Felipes) for dinner. We are traveling with our 16 mo old son and I would say we’re concerned but not overly dramatic over covid. We are wearing masks indoor but not outdoors if we can mai rain 6’ distance. Some people are wearing masks outdoors, everyone is required to wear a mask inside except for when at a table eating/drinking. . This is our first time here so I can’t compare to a “normal” day otherwise, but people seem to be respectful of space and it doesn’t seem crowded to me. But we’re not out late, back to resort by 8:45pm. We feel ok with our decision to come. I hope this helps you.Edited: 10:40 pm, July 14, 2020 "
"I can understand that, if too many places are closed, you wouldn't want to go to Florida. But if lots of places are open, that creates more opportunities for you and your family to become infected. So regardless of the answer to the question you posed, why would you want to travel to a coronavirus hot spot? See cape-coral-daily-breeze.com/page/…""In Lee County, a new one-day record was set when the number of positive COVID-19 cases jumped from 8,848 to 10,123 on July 12. The number of coronavirus cases in Lee County has leveled off the last two days. As of July 14, there are 10,631 coronavirus cases confirmed in the county. Since June 29, coronavirus cases in Lee County have spiked 98%."""
"The only one who can decide if you should come here is you. With that said, if all you want is beach time it is safe if you stay away from the beach in the Times Square area. For us we won’t eat inside any restaurants, only outside and if the tables are far enough apart. Here in FMB masks are required in every public building and in public areas of hotels and condos. We live here and we feel safe but the only buildings we go into are Publix and CVS and only on off hours."
Thank you everyone for your replies. Your help is much appreciated!
"I am in your same boat, we leave in one week from today. We don’t know if we should cancel or go for it."
"We are scheduled to leave on August 9th and I just do not know what to do. This post was very helpful. Part of me wants to go but a small part of me is hesitant due to COVID. It is a very hard decision to make especially when you have to book flights and pay for a rental car and lodging. It is only my daughter and I going and we just really want to sit on the beach and go out for dinner. Not really do much else so I keep thinking we are o.k. The number of cases in my county have been going up also but I still go to work, eat out, etc. so I feel as if I can do the same thing in FMB as I can here."
Would you have gone to NYC in March/April? Probably not. I would cancel.
Lets see ... should I vacation in the very epicenter of a deadly pandemic ... hmmmmmm ... Is this a serious question ?
"Travel, whether by air or road, is a huge part of why we are unable to get this virus under control.  The more places you go the more infected people you are exposed to, and the more people you are exposing yourself to, in case you might be infected.Also, travel restrictions and quarantine requirements can change overnight and cause major issues for you while you are en route or away.Be patient.  Stay safe, stay close to home, and help stop the spread."
"I don't think that's fair for some to shame you for wanting to get out and live your life. Obviously taking precautions to minimize risk, but life is full of risk. And after the miserable start of this pandemic and clearly what's to be expected as a miserable winter, I don't think there's anything wrong with getting out and soaking up some beautiful sun and ocean air while you can. I'm currently here in FMB, and I've noticed everyone adhering to the indoor mask requirement which coming from Maryland, I've been used to for months. We're staying in a condo so most meals will be cooked here but there is no shortage of restaurants with outdoor dining. The crowds to me seem much less than I'm used to which is a bonus. We'll see what the weekend brings and I haven't made it up to Times Square yet. I say, go, have fun, be safe!"
"If you will need to go out for most meals, then I would not come. We haven't eaten out in a restaurant in the Fort Myers area for a very long time. The last time we went to an upscale restaurant for lunch, no precautions were being taken, and we felt totally unsafe. If you can eat in for some meals, and get take-out for others, then I would say go. There's plenty of room on the beach. If you like to set up for the day, you might need to move, or confront others who set up too close to you. The beaches are closed on the east coast of Florida, and many people from there come to the west coast, especially on the weekends. Fort Myers Beach has a mask mandate, and many of the stores, such as Publix, Target, and Walmart, are requiring masks as well starting next week, so the mask requirement will finally be enforced in more places. If I had to fly, I couldn't do it. We've cancelled any trip where we need to fly until May of next year. And we've cancelled all of our driving trips in our RV outside of Florida until next year since we don't' know where we'll need to quarantine, and where we won't be allowed to enter at all."
"TRhodes; PANDEMIC. Your life will (most likely) still be there to live when it's over. Until then, we all have an obligation to each other. People need to stop thinking so selfishly. We all want to take our vacations, but it is what it is. Be responsible, stay home."
"My husband and I are old enough to be considered 'at risk', just because of our ages. We mostly stay home, other than trips to the grocery store. However, we do go out for dinner once a week or so. Only to places that hove outdoor seating, and, only where everyone is masked. We've also done a couple one night stays in near by cities, same rules, outdoor dining where everyone wears masks. Masks at all times (other than when in our room) at hotels.Is it safer to stay home? Almost certainly. But, I really don't think our behavior is very high risk, either for us, or, the places that we go. And, it does help the economy."
"""Not very high risk"" behavior still carries a risk.  If you only infect one person rather than ten, is that okay?  If you only encounter one person who infects you, is that okay?"
"Since we're home 90+% of the time, and, we are always masked when we go out, I just don't think there is that much risk. We're old enough that the odds of us being asymptomatic spreaders is slim. We obviously wouldn't be going any where if either of us is the least bit sick."
"Right now in Lee County, if you are exposed to 10 other people for an extended period of time (as you might be in a restaurant), you have a 50 percent chance of being in close contact with a person positive with Covid19. Do you want to start spreading it while you're still here on vacation, or after you go back home. It's been a long time since we went out to eat in Lee County, and we don't plan to go out again until the numbers start coming down."
"We only eat outside, and, most recently in Charlotte County. Closest table was at least 10 feet away."
"And this is why we can't/won't get this thing under control. Most people are extremely selfish here in the US, as evidenced by comments above. What is not ""fair"", are those of you who refuse to accept reality, dragging those of us doing our part along with you (and the rest of the country/world as well). The ONLY way to get this virus contained is for everyone to stay home to the maximum extent possible, and wear masks when you must be in public. That's it. There is no other way."
"Sorry, don't agree. Be smart about going out. Wear a mask. If you choose to go to a restaurant, dine outside at one where the staff is masked, and, there is at least six feet between tables. And, don't go out in large groups. Been doing it this way for months, as far as I know, i'm not sick, and haven't been."
cool
"The evidential facts around a young (or middle aged) family getting sick from Covid are very low. If you're older you might need to be more mindful. For 99%+ younger families it's more of a mind virus than a body virus. Importantly, Covid is case specific. You should really not ask a forum about it and rather, consider a consult with your doctor and simply ask them what they think since they are better connected to your health records and can hopefully navigate a sensible plan for you relative to what they know about your situation and covid. We have a trip coming up and we have zero concerns about Covid. We're more concerned about things just not being open or our government requiring a 14 day quarantine upon return if we travel there, or simply limited enjoyment of areas due to restrictions. To be clear, We're happy to honor mask wearing and other mitigation plans that local municipalities put in place, but if we have to quarantine on return or things are closed, it unfortunately takes a lot away from the trip goals. We're hoping that's not the case as things evolve. But who knows. Difficult times to make decisions. I'm sure you'll figure out what's best for you and your family. Best of luck to you.Edited: 8:35 pm, July 19, 2020 "
Where did you get those scientific numbers Einstein?
Debi-your mind is already made up; explaining facts and science to you would go nowhere.
Thank you Jean H. Be safe.
"I was in Marco Island 7/12-7/17. When I was there, I didn't see many people at the beach and the town. People wear mask when they're in store and restaurant. The beach was not crowded and people were pretty good at social distance. I came there just because I booked the rental house awhile ago. So, basically if you wear mask, social distance, and don't go to bar, then I think you'll be ok. You just need to be cautious and follow CDC guidelines. Good luck and enjoy your vacation."
"We have 6,600 permanent residents in Fort Myers Beach and we have a order to wear masks inside public areas in public buildings.Edited: 9:23 am, July 30, 2020 "
