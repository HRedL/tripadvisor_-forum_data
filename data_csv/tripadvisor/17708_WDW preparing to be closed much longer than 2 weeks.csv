"Signs are that WDW is prepping to be closed for much longer than 2 weeks.They have sent home the college program kids. This is a sizeable chuck of their work force. If they were confident of reopening soon they would definitely be retained.Contract entertainment from around Epcot are being let go. Not put on hiatus. The contracts are being ended. Likely some final performances happening tomorrow.Various mechanicals are being prepped for long term downtime or storage.Regarding the virus, the first cases have been confirmed in the county. These include an airport TSA officer. The testing program is still ridiculously limited so real numbers are going to take time.People should expect that the parks will be closed until end of April. With some good luck, they open in May. Bad luck, they will be closed at least 3-4 months."
They realise that the future is highly uncertain and is indeed quite likely to be an extended period.So what they are doing is cutting as much of their costs to protect their cash. No business can sustain full costs going out and nothing coming in forever. Some cannot cover it even for a very short period.
The Paris park is letting anyone due to arrive before june 1st rebook or cancel. This makes me think they will be closed until end May at least. Wdw will probably be similar.
"The new CDC Guideline, suggesting 8 (not 2) weeks for public school closings, may apply in principle. The intensity of crowds, proximity and pandemic transmission risk—including among at-risk 60+ attendees—is greater in theme parks than in public schools.https:/…considerations-for-school-closure.pdfEdited: 5:29 am, March 15, 2020 "
Disneyparis closed until April 16th possibly longerv
Seems rather silly to try to predict what is going to happen based on current actions. #1 is correct in stating many actions being taken today is based on cost. No business is going to pay employees to do nothing indefinitely. That is not an indication of how long Disney will be shut down. I can tell you what WILL happen: All parks will open as soon as possible and upper management will monitor and meet regularly to make ongoing decisions to protect the bottom line depending on how long this lasts. They also know they won't be fully staffed when they do open which means lots of overtime for those who report to work. So they will survive without college interns so put away the crystal ball. I couldn't guess how long this is going to last. I think Chicken Little is going to have more say in that than common sense will.
"Littlebiffone, that’s a good benchmark. Disney would need some kind of positive benchmark or results to reopen in 2 weeks and that’s not gonna be forthcoming. The results from last night sealed that. Reopening in 2 weeks was a long shot from the get go. Last nights results killed that.Mke guy, common sense, no big deal, already peaked? I admire your optimism. If there had been an aggressive testing and containment response n the us from the start I’d share it. But there wasn’t. Instead there was a lot of people who thought exactly like you. And here we are."
I think it is going to be a long haul for sure. This thing has been around since December and it is still going strong including countries that are very warm. Cirque is closing shows and I bet a number of them are heading back to Quebec.I cannot imagine how scary this is for families with college kids trying to get back home
"Re: post 6Yarbogash: thank you.The same essence, from a different vantage point:This morning, Dr. Fauci emphasized the magnitude of this in discussing the possibility of a national lockdown.While early, this is more consistent with 2 months (or more) than 2-4 weeks."
"Talking about isolating over 70s for up to 4 months in the UK. Looks like it's going to be July before we get back to anything approaching normality. We're booked for August so I'm not worrying quite yet, not that it would help, but Spring is looking like a write-off."

"“”It takes 6 weeks to ""resolve"" a case of Covid 19””Is that fact??I read this week a sports person who declared they had the virus & a couple of days later said he was feeling so much better.."
"I’ve not heard how long it takes to “resolve” a case, however I’m sure it depends more on the age and general health of the person involved. Also, I’m not sure that “feeling much better” actually means that the case was resolved as they are more than likely still able to transmit the virus to others even if they are feeling better.This is conjecture on my part because there’s still so many unknowns with this virus."

But yeah, home is probably best place for them right now.And I don’t have any special access to Disney info at least.

<<>>You didn't need to say that since it's obvious.

All companies are preparing to be closed just in case. It’s the responsible thing to do so I don’t know why anyone would be surprised. Disney is just trying to conserve cash. Two weeks all shut down is a loss of millions if not more. What the Asian and Paris parks are doing has no connection to the US parks. Disney doesn’t control those parks since they don’t own the majority.
"Speculation helps no one, just like the idiots hoarding toilet paper."
"I wish there was a chance this wasn’t so but, no, imho there aint. This isn’t speculation and it’s not things they are doing ‘just in case.’ They are not preparing for a closure of 2 weeks. They are preparing for a closure of longer than 2 weeks. It’s not a guess.The profile of the virus in Florida and beyond and the chronically inept testing program means they are not going to catch any breaks.Imho the published 2 week notice is purely for pr reasons and for logistical reasons like spreading out the load on their already overwhelmed call centre.Bricker was slow to catch on to what the emerging virus would mean to WDW but he understands now, from Disney Tourist Blog:One of our first thoughts upon hearing this news is it reiterates that Walt Disney World is not realistically expecting to reopen the parks on April 1, 2020.

Why does it sound like the U.K people are concerned about Disney reopening while the majority of the US Citizens are concerned about outbreaks and cures.
"?? Tenni, it’s people that work there that have provided much of this info. They have figured it out pretty quick. In one Facebook group with a lot of Disney cast members in it some have said they’ve been told straight out to apply for unemployment insurance because they will be off work for a long time. Side note: This story that Disney will pay cast members during the shut down has a lot of fine print. Some have just been let go."

Tenni Disney does now fully own Disneyland Paris.
"Well I have a friend that works there and she didn’t know disneyworld was even closing until I told her. That’s how little cast members know in advance. Sorry that I don’t think a Facebook group has all the answers. Only upper tier employees know what’s going on beforehand. But really why does it matter. They are closed now and will decide when it’s right to reopen. Telling people that Disney will be closed for months, when you know nothing, only causes panic."
"""Much longer than 2 weeks""As you consider planning your trip to the Orlando area, it may be helpful to consider the CDC suggestion that schools could do more virus control at 8 weeks than 2 weeks, Dr. Fauci stating today that the main thrust of the virus could last 8 weeks, and the CDC Interim Guidance today focusing specifically on crowds and proximity in virus transmission:""Guidance as of 3/15/2020""Large events and mass gatherings can contribute to the spread of COVID-19 in the United States via travelers who attend these events and introduce the virus to new communities. Examples of large events and mass gatherings include conferences, festivals, parades, concerts, sporting events, weddings, and other types of assemblies. These events can be planned not only by organizations and communities but also by individuals.""Therefore, CDC, in accordance with its guidance for large events and mass gatherings, recommends that for the next 8 weeks, organizers (whether groups or individuals) cancel or postpone in-person events that consist of 50 people or more throughout the United States.""Events of any size should only be continued if they can be carried out with adherence to guidelines for protecting vulnerable populations, hand hygiene, and social distancing. When feasible, organizers could modify events to be virtual.""This recommendation does not apply to the day to day operation of organizations such as schools, institutes of higher learning, or businesses. This recommendation is made in an attempt to reduce introduction of the virus into new communities and to slow the spread of infection in communities already affected by the virus. This recommendation is not intended to supersede the advice of local public health officials."" https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/co…____Thus, as the course of the virus unfolds (currently total US cases at 3533 with 590 new cases yesterday, and 63 deaths)--apart from what hotels, theme parks or others may do--it may be prudent for Orlando visitors to wait to see what develops, not plan to come before mid-late May, and if then to do so on a refundable basis."
"Tenni, panic? As noted below cdc is now advising people to avoid gatherings of 50 people or more for the next 8 weeks. I was thinking 6 weeks if we are lucky but 8 sounds safer."

Why do you continue to belabor the parks reopening dates. They will open when they open. Any talk of timing is pure speculation. I'm sure they will post a big announcement when they have a reopen date.
"Tenni, why do you care? Why do you keep trolling this thread? It’s a forum for discussing travel in Orlando. WDW is the major attraction there. When it reopens is of major concern to just about every poster here.Ive posted facts and conclusions that are similar to what most of the major Disney forums and blogs are posting. The real knock is that I’m not posting anything too original.If you need to stick to official Disney announcements to maintain your piece of mind then fine, move on. Nobody is forcing you to read the thread."
"I don’t need peace of mind. I’m local, I have no vacation planned. What I don’t like is rumors told as if they are fact. I heard from my cousins girlfriends mom that Disney will be closed until October 23rd of 2022. My statement is as factual as what you are posting. All that does is cause people to panic over information that isn’t accurate. I doubt Disney or any other company knows what they are doing past the 31st. Most are just in a holding pattern waiting to see what happens. But please continue with your need to be first posting information that isn’t anything more than a guess."
"If it takes as long to stop it in North America as it seems to be in Asia then I guess it will be a bit more than 2 weeks. I think Disney will recover but it is hard to watch all the news. If we all get through this unscathed it will feel like our favourite team won and we can all say ""I'm going to Orlando Woohoo!"""
"Good point except I haven’t posted anything that is a rumour. I’ve stuck to facts and where I’ve given estimates I’ve been clear those are my estimates.Numerous college program participants have directly posted their experiences in many places as the program was dismissed.The Epcot entertainment staff that was let go all posted it on their own fb feeds.Storing mechanical stuff, reported by cm’s, observed by guests.Etc.A lot of the first hand stuff ends up in https:/…post-61685806I’ve been lazy not posting as many links as maybe I should have but again within the Disney online community this is not secret info.

"Disney college program sent home all the staff at the time of the closure. This is about 20-30% of their front line workforce. The next group was scheduled to start May 1. The students stay in Disney housing and typically arrive up to a month before their start date. Arrivals for that group are suspended until April 20 or later. https://support.disneyprograms.com/hc/en-us For the park reopening, April is a wash. I think that’s a given now. They haven’t told the next group that they will not be coming. This can change of course but right now it says they think they will have a need for this staff sometime in May. I think within the next week Disney will extend the closing date and change that college program info but for now, for better or worse Disney is saying to that staff to plan to be in place ready for May.Edited: 12:22 pm, March 18, 2020 "

"I live close enough to Disney to see the fireworks from my backyard. The economic impact will devastate this area. It's not just Disney, it's all the them parks, the Disney hotels and restaurants. Many other hotels and restaurants have shut down as well. With no events happening at the Convention Center (the second largest in the country) I expect to see the majority of hotels and restaurants on I-Drive close as well.The decision to send the CP's and IP's home was a wise one. It was based on sound business practice, not emotion. As far as the people sent home, life isn't always fair. It's a tough lesson we all learn at some points in our lives. There is no work for them, so housing them was a drain on the companies finances. When the parks reopen, there are plenty of local workers who will need jobs, because to be frank, many restaurants, bars, stores, and hotels aren't going to survive this shutdown. Workers who won't need to be housed and transported. Locals who have kept WDW afloat during other trying times, such as after 9-11 when no one would get on a plane, or after the 2007 economic crisis when hundreds of thousands of people cancelled their Disney vacations. It was the local dollars that flowed in to keep the parks afloat. It will be those same local dollars again, and Disney realizes that local employment is healthy for their bottom line."

"I wondered when they do finally reopen if they would somehow limit crowds. Not sure how they would to it, maybe have a much lower than normal capacity and close the park when that number is reached.

They would not be popular but would allow them to reopen and get going again on a much smaller scale."

Based on watching all of this pretty carefully they will be extremely lucky to open by Christmas and that will only happen if wave two of this virus does not set in.

"The silence from Disney has been amazing. March 24 and no update yet. And the only comment on the death of Jeffrey Ghazarian, first fatality from the virus where the person had visited the parks while contagious, was literally a 2 sentence offer of condolences.Disney staff should be getting new schedules today for next few weeks and instead word is they are getting calls from supervisors to wait for news.Disney seems to be taking this right down to the wire.Meanwhile Ritz Carlton is closed until end of May citing huge drop in business. Hilton Buena Vista Palace same. If Disney’s bookings are similar then they might follow the same pattern."

"The HEALTH ramifications of NOT closing things long term is devastating. Can't work or spend money if the virus sickens/kills the volume projected if it's not taken seriously. What will be the economic impact then? Personally, I'd like to see the medical experts handle the job of predicting the health and well being needs, and leave the politic(ian)s out of it too. Especially those focused on their re-election chances instead of our well being. I don't know how long is the right time to wait. That's the medical experts job to figure out. I trust them vs people with other agendas (no matter which political party they are affiliated with).Do you really want to go to WDW and be around thousands of other people, before it's safe to do so? Standing in line next to someone who has a virus that is twice as contagious and ten time deadlier based on current statistics? Or someone who has it and coughs on their hands, and then touches a railing on the ride in front of you, when the virus was capable of living on inanimate objects for 17 days?I would like Disney to do the right thing, listen to the CDC, and be a leader in protecting their guests, instead of worrying about their bottom line and keeping quiet.https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/cdc-coronavi…https:/…"

"kmichalec: I think what you wrote is decisive. It occurred to me: In addition to the 3 dimensions, Einstein identified a Fourth dimension: Time. Kmi, I think you identified a Fifth Dimension: Medical Authority. In other words: on what we all face together, there are no 3 dimensions....and not even Time. Medical Authority will determine when it's safe and when the parks open and under what conditions---irrespective of calendars, speeches, wants-needs-desires, Dole drinks, size, smell, Santa, even Time itself. The parks reopen not on a schedule, not on a calendar --but by The Word...By The Force: Medical Authority-Whenever it might be.Yoda and Obi. You summoned them.

April Fools?
Disney hasn’t announced anything because they haven’t decided yet how long they will stay closed. I would expect an announcement probably tomorrow.
"Re: post 1311. More current data, on total Coronavirus cases, places the US #1 in the world, ahead of China. source: Worldometers.2. The Governor decided not to restrict Spring break beach crowds. The decision, and subsequent cases among some attendees, received worldwide attention.3. With recent data, Florida is within 500 cases of being #4 in the US in total Coronavirus cases, behind New York, New Jersey and California (tied with Michigan).Question: With the Governor’s decision on the beach crowds and since, air travel restrictions, and the recent data: may these collectively impact the decision of foreign visitors to visit central Florida theme parks in the near term, and thus impact an optimal date for their re-opening?"
Some might not want to return for a while.
"The places we were looking at going this year in order:California, Florida, New York and New JerseyGo figure...."
April dates available that is scary. I guess it is okay if you are a local but I don't think there will be many out of towners. Guess it will be a lot of fun though.
"Well, If they do open in April, I doubt there will be visitors from New York, New Jersey or Connecticut as Florida’s Governor has decided we’d need to self quarantine for 14 days from the time we arrived."
"Post 138 - guess it’s okay if you’re a local!Are you suggesting local social cleansing? This virus doesn’t go round asking you if you are a local or not. It is trying to infect as many people as it can. People are infectious seemingly way before they know they’ve got it and in some case seemingly some ‘lucky’ people do not even know they have had it. ‘Lucky’ for them but very unlucky for everybody they come into contact with.Theme parks just cannot enforce a 2 metre social distancing rule. My wife works in a supermarket and even now with marking on the floor people ignore and when she say please step back, social distancing please. They reply things like why?"
"Hi am in UK booked Virgin holidays for mid July 2020 at moment they are saying our flights are still scheduled we are due to pay £5K mid April to settle holiday & holiday insurance won’t pay out it’s between us & virgin. Another party going is also supposed to pay another £10k ( total £20k ) with another uk tour operator. Now we appreciate no one really knows when this will truly end but clarity from the tour operators instead of covering their bottom line would be a huge help. It’s all legally wishy washy & because of their vague information it is putting us off paying the rest & cutting our loses ( £500 v £5,000) or our friends (£10k). By virgin saying holiday is on keeps us in paying them however the news in UK is bleak and USA just starting increase cases. Just strikes me greedy rather than honest ? Maybe? If I can have identical holiday for same price 2021 that will be perfect. But reading they are wanting more money to do that?"
"Indie I do understand. I’m not so different with an Aug booking and mid a June owe Disney over £7k, I’m out currently for £4.5k.However you cannot expect operators to cancel trips that they haven’t yet been told by the government of our or the destination country to cancel. Do you want them to still be in business for years to come? If so this is the only way it can work.If you are thinking even if the flight runs you do not want to go (I am currently of thinking I do not want to go this year) then it is your choice. In such cases you are not covered by insurance. To include a customer changed their mind cover the cost of insurance would skyrocket."
"We are due to go in September, deposit of £500 already paid, balance £4500 to be paid in June. We won’t be going.From the papers I have read in the Lancet, until there is a vaccine available we are going to be living like this in various forms( ie they might do some kind of lifting the restrictions combined with enforcing them again for periods)Call me a pessimist but visiting a theme park is the furthest thing on my mind.Unfortunately for the USA, they are about to become the new epicentre of the virus, if they haven’t already. I visited New York twice last year, the place and the people are amazing, it breaks my heart to see what is happening there."
"Almost one quarter of Florida residents, the most vulnerable, are 60+.Public health experts say that Florida doesn’t have much time to protect them (and others) before hospitals become overwhelmed. A Professor of Epidemiology at Harvard has stated it is already “past time to intervene to slow transmission [in Florida]”.https:/…ampWith the severe shortage of tests, the number of cases involving the elderly is likely underreported, many patients most in need are not being identified as their condition deteriorates, and the Governor’s insistence on “good data” first thus means no further protective action is taken.Taken together, the headline issue has become: Could Florida “be the next epicenter?”https:/…5083283002Those considering theme park visits may question how the Governor’s approach will protect their older family members, or encourage their visits. Pending persuasive clarification for those families, the direction may be to delay, rather than accelerate, prudent theme park opening dates."
"Palm Beach County, the third-largest in Florida, has 1.4 million residents, many of whom are elderly. There, 1,666 tests have been conducted.It would be beneficial for all concerned if the implications are taken into account in considering theme park openings."
"""Almost one quarter of Florida residents, the most vulnerable, are 60+.""What is even scarier is the lack of hospitals where they are.You posted earlier, Sumter county and Citrus county with the percentages..i was surprised Marion wasn't listed as well (all 3 right next to each other.)They are all rural, and lack hospitals. Between the 3 counties, theres only 5 that I know of, and if I'm not mistaken, they probably do not have ICUs and if they do, its not many at all.Edited: 8:26 am, March 27, 2020 "
I see that many people in the USA are relocating to their “second” homes thus putting pressure on the services in places such as the Hamptons for example I wonder how many have second homes in Florida - this could stretch the capacity in hospitals The “Stay at home“ mantra we have drummed into us here doesn’t seem to have the same impact in the USA - yet
There will always be people that do what they want. I'm sure that isn't specific to the US.My family hasn't left our house in over a week unless it's to go to the grocery store. Everyone I know is doing the same. Every country has their own group of stupid people that think rules don't apply.
"Attorney General William Barr recently cautioned with respect to the Coronavirus: “We don’t want our institutions to become petri dishes.”https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp…The petri dish analysis has been applied earlier to public and amusement gatherings.https:/…The CDC Guidelines identify crowds and proximity as leading sources of pandemic Coronavirus transmission.The core point is: theme parks must avoid becoming “petri dishes” for Coronavirus pandemic crowd and proximity transmission risk. Until any pertinent conditions and risks are resolved to the satisfaction of independent, pre-eminent, objective, non-politically-appointed medical experts—and the findings and analysis made public—they should not re-open. This is in the strategic interest of all concerned. The public will likely respond, depending on the rigor of the medical evaluation and conditions at the time, with—or without—their patronage."
"Back to the immediate topic at hand, it looks the Disney Workers Union is also upset by the lack of communication from Disney. They sent a public letter to Disney yesterday expressing their frustrations. I'm starting to wonder if it's not so much Disney is trying to decide what to do about opening/closing past the 1st (as they know they will need to stay closed), but what they are going to do about the workers, considering they paid the workers for the first closure (and got a lot of props for doing so), but maybe now they are considering not paying them for the next one as the longer this goes on, the more this hurts them financially? (purely speculation) https://blogmickey.com/2020/03/disneyland-un…Disney just also announced that Disneyland Tokyo is closed through April 19th, but no word yet on the US parks.https://blogmickey.com/2020/03/tokyo-disneyl…Edited: 9:18 am, March 27, 2020 "
I think it is going to be a very long time for them to reopen. Hopefully they could work on refurbs during this time to keep employment up and then when they do open everything will be ready to go.
"Hmmm, well let's say you are a welder, or a painter or an artist you could easily work far from someone. Nobody should be forced but some might want to."
"There’s also problems with construction workers working with “distancing” recommendations. 10/20/50/100 or whatever workers on a building site with 1 or 2 toilets to share..I know they don’t go together, but you can see issues with that.."
"Mike - Thanks for the response. My point wasn't about WHEN they decided to open (I think they realize they have to stay closed), my point was more around how I think the reason they haven't announced anything is they are trying to figure out what to do about paying employees. Universal Studios has already announced they are closed through the 19th of April AND they will be paying their employees for this time. I think that's forcing Disney's hand, and maybe they were considering other options regarding payment, but now they may be forced to, or they will look bad. I'm speculating that this may be the reason for the prolonged silence from them."
"As Florida passes Michigan and approaches 3,000 active cases, 850 health care workers pleaded with the Governor to take specific actions to protect Florida residents, patients and health care workers. Similar previous requests were not fulfilled.https:/…ampVisitors seeking protection and reassurance may not embrace the Governor’s approach and may hesitate to bring their families into the situation, which may impact the scheduling and demand on the opening of the parks.The Governor and the President share concern over the start-up of business. Honoring the request of the health care workers may build visitor confidence and contribute substantially to an earlier, stronger re-start of theme park, hotel and related businesses."
"I'm sure they want to open as soon as possible to make money, but there are other hospitality people that live hand to mouth not getting paid. I'm sure they want it more.This isn't the most expensive housing market in the country, but based on our wages, it is one of the least affordable.There will be plenty of incentive to open ASAP if possible or else the homeless population is going to be much worse. The checks that will be issued through the latest spending bill might cover a month's rent in a 1BR apartment if someone is not married. If that person has kids, it will be a drop in the bucket.We all want to think about safety, and none of us want a bunch of crap being spread from every part of the globe coming here. But, we do need to make a living at some point in time.Comments have been made on this forum about why things weren't shut down earlier? You tell that to a housekeeper making minimum wage in a hotel.Just a different point of view from some offering an opinion."
"When they do open, it could be some type of hybrid situation - open, but with lots of extra caution and procedures in place for sanitation and cleaning. Could lead to more people working, if the hotels decide to have house clean staff walking the halls and wiping surfaces constantly.I went to the SoDo Ace yesterday and they had someone holding the door open for everyone and wiped down the cc scanner after each sale. Not sure how much that does, but I suppose gives people a sense of security."
"So you can't keep your distance on a golf course? We are pushing hard in Wisconsin to get our golf courses open again. When you golf, you're not surrounded by 50 people. Keep in mind, there is still a ton of maintenance that needs to be done on a golf course so you still have to keep a grounds keeper on staff and pay him or her. Golf carts can be sanitized and most people use their own clubs. Closing golf courses is ridiculous."
the green keepers can work as they can easily keep 2m apart but riding in a golf cart is OK especially for seniors who are highly susceptible to CV - seriously??? All courses in the UK are closed to golfers - we take social distancing seriously
"Susie, if SENIORS are concerned about contracting the virus then, by all means, they should not be out on the course. However, at this point we still have the freedom to go outside and partake in activities as long as we are being responsible about it. Most people wear gloves when golfing, so touching the ball, pin, etc. can be done appropriately. If you are uncomfortable with a cart, WALK the course. I stand by my statement that closing down golf courses is going too far. The golf course also has the option of limiting how many people are on course at one time. We still have SOME freedom in this country. Let's not lose our minds here."
"Maybe just ban the use of the carts, everybody walks the course, Six feet apart or six feet under, you choose.I'm pretty worried for the American people tbh"
"Surffish I agree 100%. Life at some point has to move forward. This virus could be around for ever. The theme parks may be willing to pay their staff, for now. But how long do you think they will be ok bleeding money? There is going to come a point where they say sorry no can do. And those 100,000 employees, people that are already paid very little, will have nothing. I know a couple that work at Disney. If Disney stops paying they have no income and they have a medically fragile child. Unemployment won’t cover their monthly expenses. I know that we need containment and I understand the need to stop the hospitals from being bogged down. But there comes a point where the effect of shut down is having too much of an impact and there needs to be another solution. Millions of people without a job and possibly homeless is not better. There needs to be a balance between people and money. Yes we need to stop the spread and protect those most vulnerable but everyone still needs to live."
"Announcement on the WDW site has been updated. No longer says through March 31. Now says closed until further notice. No timetable given.Edited: 4:41 pm, March 27, 2020 "
WDW also announced they will pay cast members through April 18.
"The Disney announcement reads:""While there is still much uncertainty with respect to the impacts of COVID-19, the safety and well-being of our guests and employees remains The Walt Disney Company’s top priority.As a result of this unprecedented pandemic and in line with direction provided by health experts and government officials, Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort will remain closed until further notice.""The importance of the announcement--but especially the text itself--cannot be overstated.

I thank whatever being people pray to that I went back to school.Susie, not golf related, but I did manage to score a crazy good 64 oz IPA growler tonight when I traveled for ""essentials"" this evening:) I am still licking my lips."
"Not sure if this has been posted but looks like their updated wording says they are not accepting new booking for dates before June 1 and this is subject to change as needed. Testing the website and checking random dates before June 1, nothing, after June 1 there’s availability. So that’s Disney’s current guesstimate for reopening."
Yarbogash this still doesn’t mean anything. Really only thing you could take from this is that this is the earliest date they think might happen
"lineandalan, heh given the main point of this thread and even this forum, as ‘only thing’s’ go it is pretty much the only thing that matters for a lot of people.I see a lot of visitors and Disney fans who are discussing visiting and looking at the broader context. And then there are some who are obviously looking to go as soon as Disney will let them.End of May/June 1 was my guess for the most reasonable date to reopen but the math is making that look less likely every day."
"The Disney hotels will accept reservations beginning June 1 (subject to any unspecified changes). However, the parks are closed until further notice—expressly taking into account public safety, health care consultations and discussions with governmental units.One interpretation is:1. No major park reopening will occur until at least June 1, and likely thereafter.2. Disney is well aware that (1) their business operation of vast packed crowds is fundamentally at odds with (2) the chief pandemic risks of Coronavirus transmission through crowds and proximity—particularly as total world cases will soon pass 750,000 and US cases will soon pass 150,000. (This is compounded by current insufficiency of tests to measure existing incidence, locations, pace and trends so as to treat current patients and chart a strategic course.)3. The situation takes on further seriousness as some US health care institutions near exhaustion of supplies and capacity, and staff exhaustion and viral illness compounds existing staff shortages. Further, according to Dr. Fauci, it will take one year to 18 months “at least” to produce a vaccine that is safe and effective.4. The continuation of credibility, good will, safety, honesty and resulting reassurance of park operations is an irreducible minimum for the future of park business—whatever (gulp) the cost.5. Now that the logistical nightmare of the initial closings has been absorbed, advance deposits on hotel bookings can help cash flow—while maintaining a high level of interest in park attendance.The conclusion: the parks will remain closed until pre-eminent (not politically-appointed) medical authority finds reopening safe, domestic and international air travel is restored, and thus the public is reassured of the safety and protection of diverse park attendee ages and circumstances. That is not a date, but a set of conditions—for which progress is underway, but awaits."
"Re: post 178There is another reason Disney parks will not reopen until objective medical authority determines it is safe.They don’t have to.If you were Disney, how would you make sure you have enough cash to withstand pressure and noise to open prematurely before it was safe?How about doubling the cash on hand—such as by selling $6 billion in bonds at favorable rates (with call features)?They just did.They can wait it out. Tell the grandchildren: it may be a long while before reopening."
"Post 178-179:And another reason the parks will not reopen soon:In setting Easter (or beyond) for business reopening, the President did not mention the 10 million unemployment claims.So for return to the parks:How are people going to pay for it?And if not, for the parks: is it prudent to be (a little) patient?Edited: 4:27 am, April 03, 2020 "
The peak for Florida has really changed. Now it’s a much flatter peak with a longer downslope. But somehow the peak date moved up? Downslope into JuneCovid19.healthdata.org
"Re: Post 1811. Another model suggests a Florida peak (not end) of May 4. https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-be…2. In addition, Disney announced today it is suspending its class of interns scheduled for April 17. 3. The model in Posts 178, 179 and 180 predicts a later rather than an earlier opening. The current data is consistent with that model. Several variables, including the accelerated pace of infection worldwide and a delay in restoration of air travel, remain for resolution. In current circumstances, detailed planning with specificity in the near future may be premature.Edited: 12:54 pm, April 09, 2020 "
"With special appreciation to Yarbogash for his vision in starting and assisting this thread.For a sense of the approximate range of park re-openings, you might wish to consider:1. One view at Posts 178-180 here.2. The April 7 interview in Barron’s with Bob Iger, until recently the CEO of Disney.https://www.barrons.com/articles/bob-iger-on…Edited: 3:55 pm, April 09, 2020 "
"Post 178 is quite good. The Florida epidemic should be largely over by June 1, but other parts of the US will be continuing. It will likely take longer for international travel to resume, so that is perhaps less of an issue."
"Just read the article about possibly taking everyone's temp on entry. It may sound like a good idea but it is also troubling. When it is very hot people are going to be hotter than normal. Some people always have a slightly higher temperature than average. They are not ill, it is normal for them. How would they decide whose temperature was raised due to illness and whose were raised because that is how their body is made. Of course we all want to be safe and I have no objection to having my temp taken but I wonder how fair it will be."
"A bit off topic, but temperature screening hasn't been effective. https:/…1177"
"Apparently, Etihad is testing medical screening kiosks. So in addition to checking in, scanning your travel docs, printing out bag tags etc it will also do a quick temp, heart and respiratory rate check. In theory, I guess Disney could do something similar for theme park entry but not sure how any of this addresses the issue of the relatively large percentage of people who are completely asymptomatic. https:/…"
Trying to find where I read that Disney Parks could remain closed thru the fiscal year (September) but that the resorts may reopen
"#188Don’t see how that would make any sense what so ever..All the folk that go have to stick to resorts, with nowhere to go..If they’re going to open, open everywhere.."
We heard something like that on the local news last night. Of course it's all speculation at this point.https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/09/an…

"I'm sure they will open whatever they can whenever they can. Although there may be a furlough after the 19th, they are going to continue to pay healthcare benefits.I may have been critical of them on some fronts in the past, but paying benefits deserves a MASSIVE thumbs up."
