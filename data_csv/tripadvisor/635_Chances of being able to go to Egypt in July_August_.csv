"I really want to return, it will be a shame if not!"
Somewhat slim in my humble opinion. Stay safe and alive until you can go in the knowledge that it's over and people have stopped dying.
"Hello,in July it is difficult, perhaps in August, but better still from September to November"
"Looking less and less likely, need to get out of lockdown here first!"
"I thing July or August is not realistic. Most places have to come out of the mandatory restrictions on travel, including Egypt. Then without a vaccine till maybe sometime next year find a way for people to travel by plane that will not promote the passengers getting infected."
No chance whatsoever I’m afraid. Hopefully next year - but don’t book anything you can’t get refunded or insured for.
"It's looking less and less likely that it will be this year unfortunately. Fingers crossed that they find a vaccine, an effective treatment at least or the virus dies off on its own. I'm always hopeful but not counting on anything, that way I can't be disappointed and may be pleasantly surprised."
"I'm waiting until a flu shot is available. Then I'll schedule a trip, make reservations, and put down money. Until then for me, it's a guessing game and a gamble."
I'm with everyone else - The chances are LOW
"I dont think anyone will be travelling this year Hope you and Kath are well, John"
"I bought (relatively cheap) airplane tickets for Dec-Jan. IMO the entire world will be out of lockdown before August, let's just hope there won't be a second wave in late autumn."
It's your second point that worries me most. Lockdown looks as if it might prove to have been the easiest bit. Easing out of it without kicking things off again is going to be immensely tricky.
"#11 I doubt it very much.When it does start easing, I wouldn't expect any cheap tickets or bookings. Airlines will have collapsed. Some of their aircraft fleets will NEVER come back out of storage, the older types likely being scrapped. - This pic https:/… was 2015 BEFORE all this. They will have a need to generate income quickly and selling seats cheaply might not be seen as the way to do it.Alternatively, hotels might've keen to get moving and offer good dealsBasically - no-one knowsIf you are UK resident and bought tickets NOW or since the FCO stated Essential Travel only ANYWHERE - You would have no insurance cover because you bought it when the restriction was in force.And let's say the UK eases things first. I fly normally via Istanbul to Luxor. Both of those countries also have to have removed restrictions before I can go.So, I wouldn't expect the world to suddenly resume business as normal on 1st Aug or any other date. It will be a gradual roll-out depending on when a vaccine becomes widely available."
"eLaReF, I'm not in the UK, only visited as a tourist and have no plans whatsoever to change that in the future, unless someone paid me obscene amounts of money for very little work. I really hate the climate :) This being said, having paid something like 120 euros per person for tickets over the holiday season, including 32kg luggage, I'm not particularly stressed by the possibility of having the whole thing cancelled. And if there's no state of emergency in place the local insurance companies will insure (probably without covid coverage and so on). I'm not entirely sure why people are so pessimistic about the perspectives for late 2020? Every person who dies now is listed as a COVID victim but when we look at the outcome of the known people who were infected (like BoJo, prince Charles and so on) it suddenly becomes apparent that this isn't exactly the next Spanish flu..."
"We were due to go in 2 weeks, but have kicked the can down the road to July. If that is a no-go, we'll just move flights again. They were paid on credit cards so I'm not concerned about losing our money, etc...I'm also not concerned about waiting until there is a vaccine. What if there never is a working vaccine? Everyone seems to be taking the fact we'll get one as some kind of given. It isn't. I'd rather live my life and die of Covid-19, than be trapped indoors with no hope of doing anything again. I even gave up my furloughed job in financial services to go work in pharmaceutical operations. Things will need to open sooner rather than later or the death toll from poverty will make Covid-19 look like a case of the sniffles by comparison."
"“...this isn't exactly the next Spanish flu...”No It isn’t but, at the moment, the difference in mortality rates isn’t all that clear. Estimates of world-wide fatalities due to the Spanish Flu vary widely, eg from just under 20 million to 50 million to 100 million. The number of cases is often put at around 500 million give or take. Fifty million deaths (commonly quoted) out of some 500 million cases would be a death rate of around 10% but could have been a lot worse. Records from the time aren’t very good and, when the flu pandemic started, WWI was still going on and a lot of countries kept details to a minimum. The global death rate for the virus Is currently about 7%. This may obviously go up or down but it’s two early to tell. It’s not likely to get anything like the Spanish Flu but it’s starting to look worse than some original estimates. As for cases such as the UK PM and Prince Charles, the medical care given will be the very best available and it’s hard to draw any solid conclusions about the effects of the disease on less privileged beings in general or on the world’s population.Edited: 12:06 pm, April 25, 2020 "
"""The global death rate for the virus Is currently about 7%""NO IT'S NOT, actually far from it. It's not even 7% out of those TESTED POSITIVE, which are a small minority out of those infected. Most people are either asymptomatic or develop VERY mild symptoms, usually those getting tested are the ones who develop symptoms worse then the usual seasonal flu. Again, let me know when any person who could be considered well known in their country (let alone internationally) dies of the coronavirus without being terminally ill already. In my own country the first ""covid victim"" was a guy who was 75 years old and suffered of terminal lung cancer. Enough said...Edited: 3:46 pm, April 25, 2020 "
"Thank you Adrian. I completely agree. The most comprehensive testing in the world has been completed in Iceland, where over 50% of positive tests were asymptomatic. Means the global death rate is under 1% and most of the people who have unfortunately died had multiple health issues. If someone has stage 4 cancer died suffering from Covid-19, it doesn't mean Covid-19 killed them. They just died with it."
"Governments would certainly not risk being held accountable if cases would start increasing when people can move around again. It is fear that is driving all this, (likely) not COVID itself. Mortality really isn't that great. But when people read articles with scary titles on mainstream media, those 10-20 thousand deaths in countries of many millions (but many forget that) suddenly seem colossal. Governments will try to accommodate the tourism industry as much as possible, after all it is a huge and lucrative industry. But they might have to take some extreme measures in the beginning to show that they care about people's safety. I was reading about Emirates having started doing quick blood tests before boarding, for example. Now imagine you have asked those 2 weeks off from work and a few weeks later you are about to board the plane. But then they find out your quick test is positive, even if you likely have no symptoms. There goes the trip and the vacation days. Is it worth taking this risk and feel devastated? Traveling should be something to enjoy and look forward to, not feel stressed until the last minute. I was supposed to be in Egypt last week, that hurt a lot. But it will hurt even more if the trip gets cancelled once again in a situation such as the above. It will be a while before traveling becomes what it is supposed to be again. Some of you will take the risk in the meantime, hope that works out. I am now looking at visiting Egypt in 2021 and will consider myself lucky if I can travel there next year. Otherwise...well, Egypt won't go away, it may just have to wait a bit."
"“NO It's not even 7% out of those TESTED POSITIVE, which are a small minority out of those infected.”You’re kidding right? Those who test positive for a viral infection are ipso facto infected. According to WHO’s latest stats, there have been 187, 802 confirmed deaths out of 2,724,809 confirmed cases. That’s a mortality rate of 6.89%. Other sources give slightly higher figures but WHO is good enough here. As I clearly said, these figures will go up or down depending on asymptomatic cases and/or undetected cases etc. We don’t have this data yes, just guesstimates. Until there’s reliable data, the above figures (as crude as they may be at the moment) are the only thing to go on.Edited: 6:40 pm, April 25, 2020 "
"This has strayed a bit from the point. Before you can travel to Egypt again, both Egypt and the countries you travel from or through have to be open for travel. That means flights are available at whatever price ( after airlines have gone bust and been bailed out, then started flying again) and that hotels and attractions at your destination have to be open. In some countries the crisis may lead to economic and hence social/political/security problems that make tourism inadvisable. Or countries may demand a health check ( maybe eventually a vaccination certificate) and insurance for travellers. This is going to take considerable time IMO. It ALL has to be in place at the same time and will make travel significantly more expensive."
"verity all very good points. There will also be a period of time where those countries and the tourist infrastructure with in them will operate in a mode of ""wait and see"". As they restart their tourist industry they will be adapting how it functions based on what happens. So another big roller coaster ride as they see if they can come up with a strategy to make travel safe.The big hurdle that needs addressing is how do you make it safe to travel on the plane from A to B without causing virus spread and out break.Lots of stuff needs to be resolved before most will start travelling again."
"Bbeckett, please make the effort to understand what I was saying: that the statistics only show us the deaths and the number of those CONFIRMED INFECTED by testing. As already pointed out, the countries that could afford mass testing (like Iceland) showed us that the number of the asymptomatic carriers IS HUGE. Since there's no reason to believe that the situation in all the other countries is different, we can therefore understand quite easily that the true mortality rate is WELL BELOW 1%.  This is different and more dangerous then the seasonal flu exactly because the large number of asymptomatic carriers (which enables the virus to be carried all around the world without detection) , not because it would be more deadly.  If we have a look at Sweden, that didn't imposed any quarantine measures, and compare it's statistics with those of neighboring Norway and Denmark (which had a full lockdown) we can easily see that all the scare and economic shutdown was essentially for nothing: people still get infected and we are just slightly delaying the unavoidable, but at a huge economic and social cost."
"PS • I am something of a sceptic myself when it comes to the benefits of lockdowns but I’m not sure what you’re trying to say with the examples of Sweden, Norway and Denmark.WHO’s figures currently give death rates of 4.9% in Denmark, 2.6% in Norway and 12% in Sweden. For what it’s worth, there is a difference.Just to get this thread back on topic, the rate in Egypt is currently 7%.Edited: 6:21 pm, April 26, 2020 "
"Whether you agree with the lockdowns or think they are unnecessary and delaying the invevitable is a moot point. They are in place & we have to wait and see what each country does moving forward, the situation is out of our hands.Lets stop the bickering and be kind to each other."
"We are discussing with various arguments NOT bickering and honestly I'm quite fed up with the people who pop out and try to shut down any healthy debate about this matter. As long as no one is insulting their debate partner(s) and everyone keeps it civil I don't see any reason NOT to continue. Now, the whole scare relies on the fact that only a tiny fraction of the general population is tested in most countries. In countries like Iceland, where they were able to test almost half of the population, the asymptomatic cases were identified and the death rate turned out to be even below that of a seasonal flu. Saying we cannot extrapolate that to other developed countries with healthcare systems similar to that of Iceland (or better) makes no sense whatsoever.  Of course, if the lockdowns would be idiotically kept in place until we all end up fighting over bread then any discussions about travel would make no sense whatsoever. But it looks like popular support for lockdowns is vanishing quite fast and my estimation is that by mid-May no democratic country would be able to still hold lockdowns in place. The true question is whether or not the travel restrictions will be eased and how will that translate into insurance policies?Edited: 8:34 pm, April 26, 2020 "
"""The true question is whether or not the travel restrictions will be eased and how will that translate into insurance policies?""Naturally it will be necessary for travel restrictions on individuals by their own countries and the countries of their destinations to be eased. So for example the UK and US tell their nationals not to travel abroad and Egypt has various internal restrictions on movement (which is not new for them) and those would have to be eased. But necessary is not sufficient. Travel insurance for individuals is the capstone on a very large pyramid of financial arrangements. Some entities will not operate without insurance - it may be illegal for them to do so. Airports, airlines, hotels companies, travel intermediaries etc etc will all have to consider their potential liability to customers and the wider world if - say - they are implicated in spreading a second wave of the virus. A major international travel firm will have to be sure that the airports and hotels abroad where it sends its customers implement arrangements in line with the best practice in the home countries of its customers, or risk being sued in the home jurisdictions for any later problems. I'm sure many links in the chain rely on bank loans, and that banks will require all sorts of new checks before making or extending loans. The financial arrangements underlying the international travel industry must be extremely complicated, some may have to be rethought, and all will have to be functioning at the same time before the system can grind back into action. That's not to say an intrepid individual with no time constraints who is prepared to do whatever it takes won't be able to get to Egypt relatively soon, but I can't see the mass market reopening this year."
"The long and short if it none of you will be returning until Egypt decides when that time is tight....I am not talking Cairo here or Lucor but on the Red Sea Coast.Many hotels in Hurghada will never open again sadly that is fact and maybe a few down my way also.Many of you are forgetting also even if flights resume, schedules need to fall back in place, people will still be frightened to travel, flights will be cancelled or combined.Do not forget Red Sea Hotel workers live many 100's of kms from hotels and hotels have to be prepared and ready.Forever an optimist but sadly many are living in cuckoo land if you think August us viable it has not even been mentioned in Egypt not even lifting any restrictions.My area is still like a ghost town and will never open to what it was again and also myself have to think what is good for business.I do not have an endless pot of money no matter what the dream was.Christmas 2020? Possibly but still would not bet money at all. Egypt is always slow will never change and honestly like many ex Pat's that life here we or most have now accepted that 2021 is nearer the mark.....No one can guess Egypts thoughts but sadly it is up to this country when it decides to let people in again and in line with many countries that are already stating anyone arriving even a citizen of that country will have to self isolate for 14 days and sadly those that believe they can do this in a hotel will never happen in Egyot.Personally it has 2021 written all over it from someone living here.Egypt will not just open its doors like most want and will probably be one of the last after watching the rest of the world.Edited: 3:35 am, April 27, 2020 "
"Adrian, In forum etiquette it is not ""civil"" to capitalise comments as that is considered shouting. Neither is it civil to tell members that you are ""fed up"" with them or that they should make an effort to understand you.

"#32 KarenThanks for your common sense, common-speak overview of things. You have put things in a nutshell.I have been astounded by the number of people who are still expressing expectations of going on holiday later this year and in many cases even as early as this summer, not just to Egypt but anywhere. We all need to keep our spirits up at the moment and hoping and 'planning' is all well and good but given the myriad of uncertainties surrounding all of this, it seems somewhat naive to allow oneself to truly believe that going on holiday any time soon is a real possibility."
"Re #33 in forum etiquette it's not very civil to try and stop an ongoing debate, throw words like ""bickering"" without reason and so on. Try to learn the basics before lecturing others. ThanksEdited: 10:28 pm, April 29, 2020 "
"Back to the point, Karen is obviously correct when she says that it takes months to bring hotels back to speed. However IF travel restrictions are eased by mid May I'm fairly confident that some of them would be capable to re-open in late summer. Sure, they won't be operating at full capacity by any stretch of imagination but something like partial openings should be doable. Two things not to underestimate are:1. How much Egypt needs the tourism moneyand 2. How many people are totally fed up with being stuck in their homes and will want a beach holiday as soon as it's possible to have one. This being said, time will tell but IMHO the hotels owned by big tourism companies will definitely open if the government allows travel to resume."
"“Saying we cannot extrapolate that to other developed countries with healthcare systems similar to that of Iceland (or better) makes no sense whatsoever.”Of course we can extrapolate but, at the moment, projections based on the Icelandic data represent a ‘best case’ scenario for modelling mortality rates, infection spread patterns etc. Unfortunately, it’s too soon to draw firm conclusions. There may, for example, be as yet unknown or under-appreciated environmental and/or genetic factors at work. Equally, different strains and/or mutations in the virus could explain a large number of asymptomatic cases. The scientists are actively looking at the global data as it accumulates but won’t make any firm conclusions until the data justifies them. Hopefully, it won’t be long."
"I’m sure the hotels (at least many/most of the big ones) will open when the Egyptian government gives the OK. As already said, however, a return to large scale tourism requires both Egypt’s consent to readmit tourists and, if only for the sake of affordable insurance, the tourist’s government to withdraw any assigned “essential travel only” status for Egypt. The latter may well prove more difficult than the first. Assuming, as expected, the pandemic subsides in the coming weeks, regular tourism could get back to something approaching ‘normal’ in a few months but I suspect the odds are against it.If and when, the hotels open and the tourists return, for example, any new case or suspected case could cause a nervous/cautious management or local authority to impose a lockdown.If nothing else, publicity from a headline hungry media would then further dissuade an already nervous public from visiting. The more or less expected, second wave would send everting back to square one or worse. Never underestimate the psychological inertia of the general public. Thanks in part to the tabloids, the public consciousness sees this virus as only little short of the Black Death. Even without major second waves etc, this won’t fade immediately."
"My hope is that the public opinion will take a sharp turn against the scare mongers, since the economic interests being served by the hysterical reaction to the pandemic become more and more obvious with every day."
Has anyone seen any update since this statement was made?https:/…
#39 have you read anywhere else about the situation in Luxor currently?
"Definitely not but I must confess I wasn't looking either. Essentially I tried to gather as much info I could for the Sharm area, as that's my intended destination for the winter holiday."
"Ah, so not really Egypt then!!"
"Good one :) I wouldn't mind a week in Luxor every few years or so (like it a lot and I'm very interested in ancient Egyptian art and architecture), but in all honesty I'd spend most of the winter in Sharm every year if I was retired. For me that's the perfect winter climate."
"Re #33 in forum etiquette it's not very civil to try and stop an ongoing debate, throw words like ""bickering"" without reason and so on. Try to learn the basics before lecturing others. ThanksAdrian am I trying to stop a debate, do you see any closed posts because I dont? Every body on this thread has a different opinion than you, no one is shutting down the thread just asking you to get back to the OP question.There is plenty of reason to use the word bicker based on your repetetive arguments (your word) over mortality rates etc with people that have a different view to yours.So when you talk it is a debate and when others share their opinion they are ""pessimistic"" or ""lecturing"" haha It is also the basics on TA not to hijack a thread, which you have done.I wish you luck with August."
"Best of luck to you as well. IMO #45 is the first message on this thread that can be considering as bickering without pushing it. (zero contribution to the discussion, just petty straw splitting).  This being said, I wouldn't be buying flight tickets for August even if they were available UNLESS there was a specific cancellation policy for this period and the company was healthy enough so it wouldn't go under in a few months. Or if the tickets were easyjet cheap, in which case why not? :))"
"Zero contribution hey? read # 7, not surprised you didn't see it as you only think your ""contrubutions"" are important, more SHOUTING."
I was talking about #45 as clearly stated in my previous post. I understand that some people are cranky due to all these restrictions but try not to vent it on the forum.
