Bill - we are aware it’s now a pandemic and there are many posts relating to Coronavirus but I’m unsure why you are so keen to point out for statistics for The UAE when many other countries are affected as well.The wording of your posts suggests you are aiming for the shock factor to try and create more worry.
"Hi hannahengland - happy to change the title. I was shocked yesterday when i first heard the news and in the moment i created this thread. Title reflects this. In hindsight, you are right and i can your point and do not in any way wish to cause unnecessary alarm, Can you please advice how to amend the title? Thank youBillEdited: 9:35 am, March 12, 2020 "
You can’t amend the title
Then let’s just carry on with this one
"Bill has been doing similarly in the Singapore forum (and also others; Italy, etc.)Apparently Bill lives in Singapore, and I don't know if he has ever been to Dubai. I actually think that I might be responsible for this particular transmission (of a virus of a different sort) from the Singapore to the Dubai forum (the only 2 that I post in.) His Dubai posts only started occurring after I told him not to PM me anymore.He was exhorting travelers to ""Delay!"" when, in the early stages, Singapore had the 3rd highest number of cases. Now that it is in 20th spot ... it would seem that another title in a different forum also needs amending.99% of his posts concern the coronavirus, and typically are hyperbolic. Interesting that the moderators don't find his posts the scourge that they are ...And, if the virus was no longer an 'epidemic' one wonders how it could be a 'pandemic' (essentially a global epidemic.)"
"Observe the following post from a Singapore DE:""Observe your own advice Bill.“ BOTTOM LINE. Singapore is an amazing place! It will still be amazing and safer after the scare has passed. You need to wait it out but it’s your choice. This is just a warning and not an official one. None of my loved ones coming, be sure to protect you and yours”.You’ve consistently told people “Singapore is fine, safe or normal” or words not dissimilar, which indeed is not untrue, Singapore is the most amazing of destinations, but “fine, safe and normal” it is not.I’ve been Skyping with my mate Ivan, who works in the city and he tells me things are anything but “normal”, is he lying to me? You live there Bill, tell me your opinions, are things “normal”?Is this a time YOU WOULD CHOOSE to holiday in Singapore, or have your friends and family holiday?You’re telling everyone else things are fine.Bill post 317; 11/3/20 “ I believe in exercising abundant caution and to me, postponing travel, especially for leisure, for the time being is not such an unthinkable thing. ""Bill post 322 12/3/20. @Traveller2255. “I dont think you have much to worry about since we are at DORSCON ORANGE not DORSCON RED. Eg Singapore is NOT at full lockdown yet”.Bill, so many mixed messages, these are just two of dozens of conflicting messages and advice you seem to post. I’m confused by much of your posts and English is my first language, how others for whom English may not be, I shudder to think what they must make of it.FYI , Singapore is now 21st or 22nd NOT 3rd nor has it been since the day this thread was posted.""The thread that this DE is replying to is entitled ""Singapore - Coronavirus now 3rd highest in world - Delay!"" and has over 334 contributions (mostly by Bill.)"

"Cookie, I respect your opinion even if you do not respect mine. Maybe you work in the travel industry and promoting false safety is just what you do. I'm not saying you are wrong. Infact what I am saying is I do not work in the travel industry and so i do not have your motivation to paint a picture of false safety when WHO has declared this a pandemic, when governments are rightly concerned, when social distancing measures are being taken by authorities. When to travellers to have both views expressed and to let them choose for themselves is better and more enriching of the Tripadvisor community than to ""police"" one side, your side, as just and righteous. Say what you have to say, without being personal, and let the traveler decide for themselves.I do not care for being popular or right. We need not agree with each other nor in the expression of opposing opinions. But there are rules about getting personal and you are on the edge of them. Now if you want to carry on as you are, personal, vindictive, pointing fingers, go right ahead. I will not ignore you but i will not waste time justifying myself to you for the right to my view, regardless of its expression.Thank you"

"Cookie - yes i respect your opinion and your right to it, even if it opposes my own. Respect doesn't mean i agree, it means i don't resort to attempted character assassination or personal attack or reply with vindictiveness.Hi Wotsit, I've no idea, and I dont really care if this person is who he says he is. All ok with me. I'm disliked I guess because i don't sing from the same hymn sheet or promote a particular agenda. I say, voice both opinions, politely, let the traveler choose.CheersBillEdited: 12:21 pm, March 13, 2020 "

We hit the landmark 10M cases yesterday. That’s equivalent to 3 x everyone in Dubai getting infected. Let’s hope a vaccine comes out soon
BillNot sure where you got “10M” cases from..assuming you are in London and talking about U.K. cases?https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/
the bbc yesterday were saying 10 million cases worldwide and half a million fatalitieshttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-53212430
"There are indeed reports of 10,000,000 cases worldwide, but BillUK32 , ( who seems to be in London) said in post #22 “ we hit the landmark 10M landmark yesterday “, from which I presumed he was referring to figures in the U.K."
even our government aren't that bad at dealing with it :-)
"It is 10M worldwide. Something I’d hoped would never happen. Sadly, 507,000 deaths. I’m actually living in Singapore but have travelled to Dubai for work. Dubai is an amazing place. Right now Dubai has about 5000 cases more than Singapore and a higher death rate, but I’m sure the Government is doing all it can, working with the WHO to implement a vaccine as soon as one is ready. I look forward to coming again to Dubai. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"
"Thank you Wotsit and Purtonian, you were both right"
