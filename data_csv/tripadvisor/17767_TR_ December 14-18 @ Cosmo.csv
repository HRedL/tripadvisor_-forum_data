"This is my first trip report, so please bear with me! This was a getaway for my husband and me that was centered around going to see the Pittsburgh Penguins play the Vegas Golden Knights. We're low rollers who had a mostly uneventful time playing BJ and Pai Gow Poker so I won't say too much about that.Thursday, December 14:Our flight is due to leave PIT at 8 AM, but we had a bit of a snowstorm overnight, so getting to the airport is questionable, but we make it with plenty of time to spare. However, we sit on the tarmac at PIT for about an hour because of some kind of paperwork issue. This leaves our connection pretty tight, but at least half the people on our flight are headed to Vegas, too, so at least we have company. When we get to Denver, our flight is already boarding so we hop on. We get to Vegas, grab our checked bags, and head to the pickup for the Bell VIP shuttle (shared limo). The limo share-a-ride was fantastic and definitely worth the cost (we didn't have to share on the way there or back). It was a great way to start off our trip. We arrive at Cosmo around 1:30 PM - why had I not heard anything about the scent they pump through the property? It smells like hairspray and it's disgusting. We wait in line for 5-10 minutes to check in. We had booked a fountain view terrace one bedroom. I asked for a room in the Boulevard tower with a nice view and was given a room on the 57th floor. The room was mere steps from the elevator, which was very convenient, and we were just floored when we opened the door. The room remodel was very nice and the view was absolutely breathtaking. Photos of the view do not do it justice. After taking in the sights for a few minutes and unpacking, we head down to the Identity desk to pick up our cards and the 2-for-1 offer for Wicked Spoon that I got when I signed up online. We played Pai Gow Poker for a little while, then decided to start slowly making our way toward T-Mobile Arena. We walk through Crystals (which smells much better than Cosmo, BTW) to Aria. I had a 2-for-1 dinner buffet through MyVegas, so we decide to give it a try. It was passable: worth what we paid but we probably wouldn't pay full price to eat there again. I really enjoyed the spicy Thai beef, while my husband availed himself of the pasta bar. After dinner, we walk through Monte Carlo to T-Mobile Arena for the Penguins @ Golden Knights game. The walk-though route has some of the renovated Park MGM theming, which was meh… foofy plants… whose idea was this? The current state of the casino and other common areas is depressing. I’d stay far away until the rebranding is done. The game was packed and there were a lot of fans of both teams present. We mentioned several times throughout the night that we thought half of southwestern PA was there. We both knew multiple people who were there. Our team lost, but we mostly had fun. That is, until a guy in the row behind us fell on my husband's head and spilled beer all over anything we had on the floor - my husband's hoodie (the only coat he'd brought on the trip) was soaked and the collectible poster of Marc-Andre Fleury that he'd planned to frame after we got home was ruined. After the game we decide to head back to Cosmo for a little more gambling before bed and we turned in around 11 PM."
"Friday, December 15:Breakfast at Eggslut. This is one of the only things that lived up to the hype. The line was long, but it moved quickly. We grabbed our sandwiches, coffee (for my husband), and OJ (for me) and sat at a table near the Chandelier. I had the Gaucho and my husband had the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, which we enjoyed immensely. We might have to go back the next time we're in Vegas in June. We had late morning spa treatments at Sahra. My husband got an 80 minute massage and I got an 80 minute nourishing bath which consisted of a body scrub, soak, and massage. It was the best spa treatment I've ever had. My masseuse was so effective that I didn't even wish the massage was longer and I came out very relaxed. After the spa, we got cleaned up and headed over to the Miracle Mile shops so my husband could buy a new jacket since his hoodie smelled like a frat party and so I could buy some bath treats at Lush to use in our large soaking tub. We also stopped at the Tipsy Robot and got cocktails made by robots, because why not? The experience there was funny. It seemed like no one wanted to buy anything but as soon as we ordered a big crowd quickly congregated to watch the robots make our drinks. Back to Cosmo for a late lunch/early dinner at Momofuku. It was ""social hour"" so we sat at the bar and ordered the pork belly ramen (for him) and the chickpea ramen (for me), which we both enjoyed. I had a mojito slushie and the bartender (who was great) gave me a little sample of their seven spice slushie, which was surprisingly tasty with a spicy kick at the end. After dinner, we hit the blackjack tables and were winning big time. We decided we were tired of blackjack so we went over to Planet Hollywood for pai gow poker because the table minimums were lower. Big mistake. Bad hand after bad hand for everyone sitting at the table. We got cleaned out of all our winnings from Cosmo. Oh well. Back to Cosmo for late night Secret Pizza, which we took up to our room and ate on the terrace."
"Saturday, December 16:Breakfast at The Henry. We're breakfast people and I think this is the most we spent for a meal on the entire trip. Husband got steak and eggs, I got eggs benedict, and we shared an order of the beignets with lemon curd (which were to die for). A brief stint of blackjack. I quickly lost $100 and quit. We decide to hop over to Aria to use our MyVegas rewards for 2 signature pastries (1 reward each) at Jean Philippe, which was really just 2 $10 vouchers good for anything, which was a nice surprise. We each picked up two treats and brought them back to store in our personal use fridge (a nice bonus) in our room. I especially enjoyed my lemon raspberry muffin.We had show tickets for Baz at the Palazzo that evening so we decided to meander up the strip and hang out at V/P (where we stayed on our last trip) for a while. We had dinner at Public House with the Travelzoo deal. We actually ate there before on our last trip, so we mostly knew what to expect. To use our $100 voucher, we had a few beers, poutine, a French dip sandwich, fish and chips, and their cookie and beer tasting flight. The cookies and beer was one of the high points of our trip. We were given four cookies and four beers to pair with them, along with some tasting notes. The pairings were shockingly amazing. Both the cookies and the beer were more enjoyable together. Someone at Public House really knows their beers!The Venetian casino was chaotically busy, the busiest place we saw on the entire trip (except for the hockey game). We found a BJ table and played a bit before the show and won a good amount. We really enjoyed the Baz show, again with a deal through Travelzoo. Our seats were for the lounge area so we were seated on couches. The cocktail service left something to be desired, but the waitress comped us a round of drinks for her errors, which we appreciated. After the show, we played BJ at $10 tables at the Palazzo until the wee hours. The casino is being renovated, but it really didn't hinder us much and what we saw of the renovations was gorgeous. There were only small areas boarded up. If I hadn't known ahead of time, I might not have even noticed that it was in the middle of renovations. We picked up late night In n Out Burger at the Linq Promenade on the way back to Cosmo. I was not impressed."
"Sunday, December 17:I'm a bit hung over from the night before, so it takes me a while to get going. I grab a shower, feel human again, and we head to Wicked Spoon for our 2-for-1 brunch. I liked it, if just for the number of options, but my husband wasn't too impressed. We placed our NFL bets and played BJ near the sports book while we watched the games. I had money on the Steelers (my home team) so I was a bit salty for the rest of the day. We're not sure what we want to do since I'm tired of gambling but we're not ready for dinner yet, so we wander up the strip through the Bellagio and Caesar's Palace. I was reminded of why I don't care for the Bellagio: gawkers everywhere. The walk stirred up our appetites so we decide to go back to Cosmo for Holstein's. I enjoyed the combination of ingredients in the Rising Sun burger, but I've honestly had burgers I liked just as much at Red Robin, and more so at local burger joints. We go up to our room to pack, then back down to Milk Bar for fruity cereal ice cream, which we ate on our terrace even though it was cold outside.I go to the Identity desk to see what we can get taken off our bill through points. They tell me I have to apply my points at the front desk when we check out. Monday, December 18:4 AM, time to check out. I inquire about my Identity resort credit, and the front desk agent says they can only apply it at the Identity desk and they open at 8 AM. She said that the Identity people do this all the time and she doesn’t know why they don’t know what they’re doing. So we didn’t get to use our resort credit, which I wasn’t too happy about. Uneventful trip home in the best way possible, and we’re back with our 8 month old daughter by dinner time. Overall thoughts Cosmo / the trip as a whole:- Why did they choose such a horrid scent to pump through the casino? Seriously, WHY??- The drink service in the casino is really good. We realized that as soon as we went to play at other casinos.- The room and the service were, for the most part, 10/10. Definitely superior to our stay at Palazzo. However, we liked the Venetian/Palazzo property much better on the whole. - I heartily recommend Cosmo for anyone who uses their hotel as their base but spends a lot of time at other properties. The easy access across Harmon and Las Vegas Blvd and the Bellagio next door can’t be beat. - Identity staff need to get it together. Every time I stopped at the desk, the person working said something different from the last time, i.e. “you can’t use both of these offers.” “You have this offer you haven’t used yet!” Not to mention the resort credit that I ended up not being able to use.- We fell short of our allotted food, beverage, and entertainment budget by a few hundred dollars. I had set aside money for some nicer meals, but we just felt like going casual.All in all, an enjoyable trip. We probably wouldn’t stay at Cosmo again, but mostly because we don’t go to Vegas enough to want to stay in the same hotel more than once. It just so happens that we’ll be back in June, this time travelling with friends and taking a side trip to the Grand Canyon. We’re staying at Encore (during pool season, which I’m excited about) followed by a free night at Aria courtesy of MyVegas.Edited: 2 years ago "
"I'm glad you had an enjoyable trip, except for that pesky Cosmo scent I suppose.""I had a 2-for-1 dinner buffet through MyVegas, so we decide to give it a try. It was passable: worth what we paid""What a ringing endorsement for a buffet that gets some of the best reviews here. It's in most folks top 3 or 5 for Vegas buffets and you basically paid half price.""but we mostly had fun. That is, until a guy in the row behind us fell on my husband's head and spilled beer all over anything we had on the floor - my husband's hoodie (the only coat he'd brought on the trip) was soaked and the collectible poster of Marc-Andre Fleury that he'd planned to frame after we got home was ruined. ""What a bummer! Please tell me your husband did something about this, but it doesn't sound like he did.13"
"Eh, we liked Aria buffet, but if we're going to spend $100 on dinner it probably wouldn't be a buffet. That spicy thai beef was really, really good, though. I guess we're just not really buffet people, as evidenced by the fact that my husband didn't like Wicked Spoon all that much (which I liked, by the way). We both recalled liking the Wynn buffet a lot from our last trip, but that was breakfast, not dinner.That incident at the hockey game really was a bummer! At least the poster was free (it was what was given out in place of a program), he just really wanted it, so I don't think there was really anything to be done since the guy apologized. Unfortunately for the woman sitting on the other side of my husband, the drunk guy fell even harder on her. She left and never came back. We hoped she was OK. After that, the woman sitting behind me spilled a full glass of water on me. She was extremely apologetic, but since it was just water I didn't care. I was just grateful it wasn't anything that was going to smell or get sticky!Edited: 2 years ago "
"omgeeeee...sounds like the Golden Knights games have an epidemic of folks that can't control their spills!! I suppose it has a bit to do with drinking all day and then getting the idea ""hey, let's go to the hockey game tonight!""13"

Great report! Really enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing! The tipsy robot is now on my must list for our next trip. I had no idea that even existed. The cookie beer pairing sounds amazingly weird so we’ll put that on the list too. I’m from Pittsburgh as well so I feel your pain :(
"wifey_sd, I think Tipsy Robot is new-ish. It looks like it opened in June. It's a gimmick, but I'm a sucker for a good gimmick and it did not disappoint on that front! The drinks were pretty good, too."
"Nicely written TR, I enjoyed it. Sorry about the beer incident, that can take the shine off things.I agree about Holstein's, I was expecting much better. It wasn't bad, but I'd heard so many great things about it I guess I expected more. It was average with higher than average prices I felt.I'm sure you will love Encore, I'm assuming you've not stayed before. The room kind of spoiled me for any other hotel, the pool too (upgrade to a tower suite if you get a chance for the exclusive pool experience). However I found the dining options on site to all be a bit pricey and the casino not the most exciting, though certainly the prettiest!"
Thanks so much for sharing. Great read and great job on your first TR.
"Thanks for sharing; sucks that neither of your teams came through for you, but hey, you were in Vegas! I still haven't hit up that Tipsy Robot or Eggslut, gotta move that up on my list"
"Dang, Holsteins and Red Roiyn comparison takes me back a bit. I've eaten both and thought Holsteins blew RR away.I guess the Cosmo scent is a personal preference because my wife and I love it.Look forward to trying the tipsy robot! Wasn't there last spring.Edited: 2 years ago "
"I think my burger at Holstein's was overdone. I asked for medium, but it was dry. A juicier burger would have made a big difference. The additions (teriyaki glaze, seaweed seasoning, yam chips, tempura avocado) were really tasty all together. We were a little reticent to try a Vegas burger and shake place because we have one at home that's really good (called Burgatory). Too bad we weren't hungry enough for milkshakes at Holstein's - the ones they were bringing through looked impressive."
"We're from the area so I've had a burger at Burgatory over on North Shore. Thought it was really good, too."
"Thanks for the mention of the Lemon Curd at Henry's. My wife loves fresh lemon curd with scones & beignets.I'm not sure I understand about the resort credit at Cosmo. We don't stay at Cosmo, but doesn't it work like the other hotels? You charge all meals, drinks, spa, etc. to your room, and the credit is automatically applied to these charges. Sorry you couldn't use yours.Excellent 1st TR. Thanks for posting."
I’m just curious and I’m not overly familiar with claiming myVEGAS vouchers but you said “followed by a free night at Aria courtesy of MyVegas” all of mine say they must be used within like 30 or 60 days? Do you get longer to redeem the more coin you have or do certain vouchers last longer without being claimed since yours are for June?
"""'m not sure I understand about the resort credit at Cosmo. We don't stay at Cosmo, but doesn't it work like the other hotels? You charge all meals, drinks, spa, etc. to your room, and the credit is automatically applied to these charges. Sorry you couldn't use yours.""She was trying to use points earned through gambling and spend. They are essentially convertible to resort credit, but that has to be done and applied ""manually."" She got the old bounceback routine between the player's club desk and the front desk as to who could apply the credits.To be honest, I don't know who was right because I've never had them apply points against my bill. But it's unfortunate because I've found the Identity Desk staff to be excellent, they have a lot of detailed info available and I've found them to be the best of the strip properties.In reality, if the Front Desk doesn't currently have the authority to apply points, they SHOULD, that's where you settle your bill if you have any issues with it. Both the Identity Desk and the Front Desk should be able to apply points."
"Wow, even though you both had stuff thrown all over you it was still a good time.Enjoy your next visit and thanks for sharing your great trip report."
"Well written report, and I appreciate having it all posted at once. Sounds like a nice getaway for you."
"Yeah this is a nice report. I'm not a blanket fan of all of them as some folks are, but this one was well-detailed and included both highlights and lowlights which are good to read.I agree with the OP as far as the Aria buffet. I really enjoyed it in January, but not nearly as much in June. I was comped for both, and I wouldn't pay full price for it, either. That it's a top 5 buffet in Vegas is irrelevant, as you still have to get value for what you spend, and I don't think the value can be justified. I plan to give the Wynn buffet a chance on my trip in 10 days. If it doesn't live up to my hopes then I think I'm done with Vegas buffets outside of having them for breakfast or the occasional cheaper, value buffet like at MSS or the Orleans.Edited: 2 years ago "
I liked your trip report.If you do stay at the Encore you may want to check out the spa. I bought a day pass and it was absolutely wonderful.
Thanks for posting. Glad it was fun
The identity thing is an issue but at VIP checkin they don’t close out the folio until after getting with the Identity Desk if you ask when leaving early in the morning. I would think they should also be able to do it at any checkout station.
Enjoyed your TRThanks
Nice trip report - Thanks for sharing. I plan on going to a Golden Knights game the next time the Minnesota Wild are in Vegas. Too bad the guy spilled his beer on your husband.
"Hi there... I bought some tickets to the Golden Knights - do you recommend going early? I know it’s assigned seating, but are there pre-game events, etc going on that we should be early for?Thanks-April"
"You had a good time with a few minor glitches that should be expected,and overcome. I too use the Bell VIP shuttle every time now. Great way to arrive in Vegas and quite dependable. Thanks for the TR."
"This is an old thread but just thought I'd let you know we are buffet peope, The Wynn is by far our favorite! We also think the Aria buffet is just ok... we eat it because we get it free but would not pay full price, and didn't really enjoy wicked spoon. Not sure why these rate so high! Since you do my Vegas, try the Bellagio buffet is is really good also. We pretty much stick to the Wynn, Bellagio, and bacchanal buffets, they are the best."
