https:/…I am in Antalya right now (Kelici) and it feels like public isn’t aware of any such thing called Covid. Yes there are temp check when entering ‘some’ shops and the big malls but thats about it. On the street and in public parks 95% ppl aren’t wearing any masks or bothering with social distancing. Right now over the weekend the old town kelici area looks like one big diskothek and outdoor dining area.I am due to fly back on 26th Aug and hoping that it doesn’t go back on the quarantine list before then but am somehow not feeling too hopeful.
"I wouldn’t be too worried about that article in the SunThe table of cases is proof of how misleading the press can be - they actually shouldn’t be allowed to get away with itThey’ve just missed out loads of countries to make Turkey’s figures look worse, not to mention France and BelgiumTheir data comes from here - with some very selective editinghttps://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"
"I'm in four minds about this post. ;) On the one hand, I can't stand people who don't wear masks so I fully agree.On the other hand, social distancing in the old town centre of Antalya.... given the streets there, how exactly would that work? I guess people would have to be let in by special permit. Which might actually be a good idea. Or a lottery maybe.The Sun. Snort. But highly selective tables and breathless reporting of terrified schoolchidlren aside, I agree. The situation in Turkey is worsening.But I have to ask: at which point will the UK government quarantine its own people for walkinf around the UK?"
"I believe the figures the government are using to calculate the per 100,000 come from here:https:/…cases-2019-ncov-eueea(Turkey is on the rest of World page)In order to stay below the 20/100k threshold Turkey needs to stay below 1206 cases/day... it's currently creeping above 1250 so only below the threshold because older figures are currently lowering the average.Having crunched the figures at some length I have to admit that it's not looking too hopeful for September onwards unless the rate comes down pretty sharpish.Turkey could be stuffed long before Christmas!!"
"I don’t think that’s quite right ..... Turkey has a population of around 84 million which means that, in order to stay less that 20 cases per 100,000, there has to be fewer than 16,800 cases a week. That’s an average of 2,400 cases a day. I think they’re currently on around 1,250 a day so it would have to increase significantly."
"While it's been widely reported that they use the average over 7 days the figures don't add up if this is the case... It seems highly likely that they are using 14 days as per the ECDC data (using this method gives the correct figure of 18.5/100k)This being the case, the crucial threshold for 20/100k is 1206 cases per day."
"Grant Shapps on Friday said “the threshold is about 20 cases per 100,000, measured on a 7 day rolling average”. If this is the case, then they can have 16,800 a week.I’m not sure if it’s actually 14 or not I was just going off what he said and the fact that they do review on a weekly basis."
That’s what I’m hoping anyway! Meant to be going next week
"Even without Schnapp's comment, I doubt it would be 20/100,000 per 14-day period. By that metric, the UK itself is at 19.4 as of 15 August, as opposed to 12.5 on the 1st. Hence my fourth comment in my first post. ;)"
May I ask how you arrived at 2400? Why are some people suggesting it's 1206?
"It's the ""is this over 14 or 7 days"" question. If over 7, about 2,400. If over 14, about 1,200."
"Like suggested above, assuming it’s assessed on a 7 day rolling basis, it averages around 2,400 a day.A population of 84 million means essentially that when reviewing data per 100,000 people, that there’s 840 100,000 people. And we know they can have 20 cases for every 100,000.So 20 x 840 = 16,800 That’s how many Turkey can have in a week, meaning a daily average of around 2,400. That’s how the figure of 2,400 is reached when assuming it’s a 7 day review period.Edited: 5:04 am, August 16, 2020 "
Quarantine on Turkey will be imposed when the UK government needs to distract from something.Like they did with France to cover for the A Level results fiasco the other day. Hmm... GCSE results are due next week. I'm sure Bojo and his circus of clowns already have their eyes on Turkey or somewhere similar.
I do love a conspiracy theory Anyone who has been watching the figures will have seen they are rising by about 100 a day and with effects of Eid and Bayram not taken effect yet I would estimate that by the end of August early September will bete crunch time
Not sure if this helps with the number crunching: https:/…
"And there we have it. Dear posters, the soft trigger, as announced by a minister, is at 20 cases per 100,000 per week. The fact that your favourite website likes to give data on a three-day or fourteen-day or whatever basis is of no relevance. Or your favourite newspaper's numerically wishfully literate reporter's opinions.This is also a serious matter. The British are renowned for the gossip, but this is not about Aunt Edna's summer fling. I know that you have also become very touchy-feely and open about their emotions. But this is all getting embarrassing for the others on this forum. And as this is not just tripadvisor.co.uk, but also about a dozen sites including everything from .com to .co.za, please, no more feelings, or opinions based on what Fred down at the local said he heard from his mate's ex-missus. Facts, questions, and numbers - and relevant ones, please. ;)Edited: 10:38 am, August 16, 2020 "
"There is no scare-mongering or underhand tactics going on but there are some very short memories coming into play.Right from the start when he UK government lifted restrictions on non essential travel they made clear to UK tourists that the situation was impossible to predict and could change at any time, they then went on to say they would not hesitate to put the brakes on if they felt it necessary. They held nothing back and they have been fair about it all in that they have given the public, the airlines the holiday companies overseas governments etc a chance, unfortunately it does not appear to be working. Given the rising numbers not just in Turkey but in holiday destinations across the world no one should be surprised that quarantine measures are being introduced. Furthermore if infection rates continue to rise no one should be surprised if non essential international travel is stopped and borders closed......again.This is far from over."
"Hi GrandGourmand, never been good at number crunching but you seem to have lots of knowledge judging by your daily update, so my question is, is Turkey on course for a UK lockdown judging by the numbers? if so when do you think judging by the trend of the numbers going up.Me and my family are due to go this coming sunday in a private villa so we will be kinda self isolating and will probably get a lot of take aways and cook from home, we just need to get away from the UK and the kids are so looking forward to the pool."
"Yes, I would say that Turkey is back on course for a lockdown. But when? Turkey never really got its figures waaay down like Germany (or Spain, for that matter),and the current level is about 25-30% of the daily infection rate at its peak in April - and 140% of the rate at the lows at the end of May when we started normalising... so both worse than some other countries, and better ... and my response would therefore be, no, not yet, and I'm not sure whether it'll be countrywide, or only in certain places. But regional lockdowns have in fact already started, affecting (by my calculation) about 1% of the population or so, mainly towns and villages in central and eastern Turkey. (Also worth noting that Turkish lockdowns during peak pandemic were both much stricter - full curfews, no exceptions not even for food - and also looser (only applicable at weekends and during holidays) than the UK. And then we basically locked up everyone over the age of 65 and below 18/20 for weeks on end. I would therefore imagine that if lockdowns were re-insrituted, they would again be similar.)(With schools supposedly opening for some sort of in-person study in late September, I imagine it will be a race between the virus and vaccine producers, and I'd be very surprised if we didn't see numbers rise further from the second half of October, which is when large-scale lockdown measures might start to get implemented.)More relevant to your case, I would imagine you'll be all right. But I am as bad at forecasting the trend in this disease as anyone else. I would personally be hesitant about booking travel anywhere in the northern hemisphere after September, but I hope you will be fine.And, look, at the end of the day, this is a matter of luck in addition to precautions. Yes, if you decide to spend hours indoors with someone who is infected (even if not showing symptoms) you'll most likely catch the virus. But on the other hand, if you encounter anyone in Turkey right now, the probability of their being infected is really very low, about 113/100,000 or 1.13 in 1,000. (I arrive at by using the latest daily rate of 1.45 per 100,000, multiplying that by 19 (from the second day of their infection through to day 21, by which time they'll either stop shedding the virus or be in hospital) and multiplying that further by 4 to cover people who are asymptomatic and therefore may be under the radar or who has slipped through the cracks.) So, if you're reasonably careful and don't socialise madly, and if you do encounter people, do so largely outdoors, masked and at a distance, whether you're in the UK or Turkey, you should be fine.But someone will, unfortunately, will be that one-in-a-thousand case, and if you encounter them, well..."
"Thank you GrandGourmand for your hugely informative updates this whole time, it's helped provided a lot of clarity.Do you know where the cases per 100,000 per week can be found as a daily figure? It's not on the website that provides that info for Europe, as far as I could see."
"@Alex: I'm afraid I don't know any website that gives the one-week figure. But if you go to https:/…new-covid-cases-per-million and click on the country you're interested in, you'll see a graph of daily cases per million. Hover over the points on the graph, and you'll see the daily figures. Add the last seven together, then divide by 10 (because those are cases per million, not 100K), and you're done. A little cumbersome, I'm afraid.Or if you have Excel installed on your computer, download the .xlsx file there. That has pretty much all the information you need (there are a few surprising gaps) and just add up the last seven figures in column J, and again divide by 10."
"Thank you. The number I got for the last seven days based on this was 10.073 - far from the 20 per 100000 needed to put Turkey on the list. So either I've got something wrong or there is little to worry about for the people holidaying right now.Edited: 4:04 pm, August 16, 2020 "
"I do believe you're right. Now, obviously, this is much higher than the sub-8.0 per 100,000 levels just two weeks ago. But, FWIW, France is now about 21 and Spain about 60/100,000. The UK itself is about 11.On the other hand, these numbers can obviously change in the blink of an eye, as we have seen everywhere. So I'm not getting complacent. Turkey - and any other country in the world - has the potential to breach that 20/100,000 level, *easily* whatever their numbers might look like today. (It's just a matter of when.) Even Greece, which did so much better than either Turkey or the UK every week since the beginning of March, is now at 13/100,000.So while I'm not too fussed by what the papers say, we should all constantly expect to be negatively surprised by this virus. Unless of course we're in lockdown or something. But I'm pretty sure that no economy in the world is going to be able to endure a second round of March&April. So let's get ready for the second wave. I'm already stockpiling essentials. ;)Edited: 4:18 pm, August 16, 2020 "
"Alas, The Sun could plaster their pages with recommendations to travel to Turkey, and it wouldn't make much of a difference, and the hardcore enthusiasts will travel regardless. This is the year that travel & tourism died around the world. Let's hope we can resurrect it after April.Keep safe, everyone."
