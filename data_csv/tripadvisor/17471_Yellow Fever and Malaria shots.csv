"A friend will be stopping in St. Lucia on a cruise in Feb and was just notified by letter from their travel agent that Yellow Fever and Malaria shots are REQUIRED, and they have to show proof on the ship in order to get off at this port.Sounds official, but I'm curious if this is the norm?"
"No, wasn’t aware either were required, and I’ve already been to my practice nurse prior to travel. Perhaps a confusion by the TA with St. Lucia in South Africa, where they might be advisable?Cheers ❤️"
"The letter came right from their cruise line, Oceana, so I would have to believe they didn't confuse it with South Africa........but one never knows."
"It's incorrect. Please copy and paste the email as they can't possibly be requiring Yellow Fever or Malaria shots as neither are present in St. Lucia nor required for visiting.People do make mistakes, even those who work for cruise lines, and it wouldn't be surprising if there was a mix up between St Lucias. I remember reading about this email fairly recently on the Cruise forum, maybe check their for updates. Or call and ask them - and point out that neither are required shots for the island.."
I've been to St Lucia several times and have never had - or required - Malaria and Yellow Fever shots. Someone has definitely made a huge mistake here.
I agree....never needed them or have been advised to get them for St Lucia
Not for St Lucia in the Caribbean. Oceana is misinformed.
"It would be interesting to know exactly how the e-mail is worded? re: Yellow Fever noted on the CDC for St.Lucia (west indies) same is noted on all country health sites. proof of vaccine is... ""Required if traveling from a country with risk of YF virus transmission and ≥9 months of age.1""The Key word here is ""FROM"" Some destinations, also required proof if you've transited through an airport in a country where the virus is transmitted.It is for their protection."
"I’ve passed all this on to my friend. I thought it seemed odd myself, but what do I know. Thanks for everyone’s responses."
Zsazsa - please do copy and paste the email here. Would be very interesting to read the exact wording.
I will ask him for it.
"Bon jou ZsaZsa,Perhaps your friend is transiting from Central of South America where Malaria and YF are endemic?Saint Lucia had/has Dengue, Zika. NOT ever Malaria or Yellow Fever...Bless up! PaulEdited: 2:46 am, October 13, 2019 "
"Oh, perhaps the cruise is stopping in Central America, too. Would that make sense then? I'm not sure what all his stops are."
ZsaZsa... These are the Dates (thru 2021) and Itineraries for OCEANA Cruise Lines. There seems to be no Saint Lucia/Caribbean Cruise offered in FEB 2020! https://www.cruisemapper.com/ships/Oceana-579
"Congomon - Oceana most definitely has cruises to St Lucia in February 2020. 5 itineraries, according to their own website, on both Sirena and Riviera. As Zsazsa noted in her earlier post, she's talking Oceana Cruise line, not Oceana by P+O, which is what your link is to...Here you go: https:/…search-result-anchorAll of the Feb ones are Miami round-trips, so not transiting from Central or South America. It's very likely a generic letter, and sent out somewhat mistakenly due to St Lucia, South Africa versus St Lucia, West Indies, and a basic ""cover your backside"" letter. OP - yellow fever and malaria are most certainly not required for us here in St Lucia, we don't have either here on island...Edited: 8:17 pm, October 13, 2019 "
"Irie CReed006... That explains it OceaNIA Cruises, NOT Oceana as in the OP!Edited: 8:18 pm, October 14, 2019 "
