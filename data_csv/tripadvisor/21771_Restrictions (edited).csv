Is there light at the end of the tunnel regarding opening of bars & restaurants? Or a trusted link to keep track of for information?Flying to Munich 29th August for a weekend.
The Bavarian government is expected to announce a plan for the opening of restaurants later this week. Mid to end of May is realistic.
I’m not sure how likely your trip is to take place. Travel bans are still in place and when they are eventually lifted it’s doubtful holidays or weekend breaks will be possible as you may well be told to quarantine on arrival and on your return home.I’ve already had 2 trips cancelled myself this year and my next one is on the same weekend as you to Köln but I rate my chances of it happening at about 10%.
Thanks. Expect a refund or put to a later date then hopefully
I'd be hopeful that by late August you should be fine for this with social distancing.
"And me, but it all depends on whether we have to quarantine for 2 weeks once we arrive in Munich.Edited: 3:35 am, May 05, 2020 "
"Latest from the Bavarian government: Outdoor gastronomy (beergardens etc.) can open again on the 18th of May, indoor restaurants a week later and hotels from the 30th on."
Fantastic news.
Yes fab news I am still booked to arrive at munich with a night there and then on to Austria on the 14th July then 3 weeks later on my way home another night in Munich
"englishfrau, are you sure the border to Austria will be open in juli? I really doubt it.Also I doubt that you can stay overnight in Munich. I think you'd have to stay at the airport in Transit."
"The question which borders will open for whom is a whole different subject, of course."
"What I am finding unclear is if we, from the UK, can travel in to Bavaria/Germany for a holiday?I’m due to fly into Memmimgen June 9th for 11 days holidays in Lindau (at a campsite in a caravan) and Oberstdorf and haven’t a clue if we will a) be able to travel and b) will it actually be a holiday if we can or will it be as restrictive as things are in the UK at present?"
"Germany is less restrictive than in the UK at present (I have been in both) Whether you can travel by then is maybe a bit optimistic !Here they are slowly opening things up again, however the distancing restrictions mean that many places will not do it as it is uneconomical . I know people with a theme park ,they can open but only for 1000 guests, however it needs 300 staff and thousands of Euros of power a day so will not happen.Beer gardens can only use about 20% of capacity so agian some will not do it"
"No, nobody can travel to Germany as a tourist right now. All travel bans are still in place and there is no word out yet when and for whom borders will open again. Please refer to the website of the German embassy in the UK: https://uk.diplo.de/uk-en/coronavirus…"
Hotels are opening up for tourists end of May. Surely they will allow tourists coming in from flights if they are ready to open hotels?
Perhaps some hotels may feel they can start to open as restrictions are relaxed in the hope that they may be able to attract some domestic visitors. Although from what I can gather even holidays and breaks for Germans within the country aren’t being encouraged at present.The current EU wide recommended travel ban is due to expire next Friday. I think there’s probably little doubt that it will be extended for a further 30 days which would take it up to 14 June which is also the date when the current German travel warning is in place until. I think that is likely to be earliest possible date that cross border travel could start again but even that is optimistic. It’s also worth baring in mind that here in the U.K. we have been hit severely by the virus and we are also several weeks behind many other countries in terms of unlocking restrictions. Therefore it’s hard to see how once borders across Europe do start to open we will be anywhere near the top of the list. Which is why I am less than optimistic about being able to travel in August. For June I think it’s all but certain that trips won’t be able to happen.
"What Dean says.Domestic holidays are all that's being discussed right now. Well, except for that Austria wants the Germans to come back asap, but Germany is rather hesitant when it comes to border openings. That people start to criss-cross the country again in larger numbers makes the government sweat already, but the states are eager to give the tourism industry in their regions some perspective..."
"""Outdoor gastronomy (beergardens etc.) can open again on the 18th of May, indoor restaurants a week later and hotels from the 30th on.""That's great news!"
"Jordan , what you don't seem to realize is that there are severe restrictions, so for many places it will be 20% of capacity. For many this is economically not viable so they will remain closed"
""" what you don't seem to realize is that there are severe restrictions, so for many places it will be 20% of capacity.""The U.S is also doing only about 25% but the reality is this is how many live, so they have no choice."
It now looks as if the U.K. government are going to insist on anyone entering the country has to self quarantine for 14 days with effect from June. This is going to put paid to most people’s hope of an overseas summer holiday/break this summer.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/0…
How will they enforce if you are living here? Follow us home from the airport?
If you read the article it states that on arrive you will be required to give the address of where you are staying and that random checks will be done to ensure people are where they say they are.It’s still speculation at the moment but we will find out for sure when Bojo gives his speak tomorrow.
"Fair enough. Already been stopped by 3 cop cars for suspicious activity (going to collect some paint from a shop to start work ha) so I wouldn't be taking any chances. It is, what it isEdited: 5:21 am, May 09, 2020 "
"Better late than never! It should have been done months ago. In the European countries that implemented this, you usually have to fill in a (paper) form with your address and police will be checking on you to see if you're adhering to the quarantine. If not, you face hefty fines. I don't see that happening in the UK though. The way they are policing their ""lockdown""..."
"Germany will ease quarantine rules for visitors arriving from the EU and the UK, the interior ministry says.On Wednesday it began to open some border crossings with Austria, France and Switzerland. The country said it is aiming for ""free travel"" in the EU by June.Source: BBC"

"As for a concise overview of the new rules, I like bild.de - they always break it down by federal states, and they always keep their texts very brief. I think a google translation should be fine. But no-one can say whether you'll have a wonderful time in Munich at the end of August, or whether we'll be in the middle of the second wave with most things closed."

"The situation as of today is that outdoor seating at restaurants and bars can open with adequate spacing between tables and customer contact details are being recorded in case it is needed for contact tracing. Shops and public transport are now running as per normal but masks/ face coverings must be worn. There was never a work ban except for shop openings, so now is no different to the past months - lots of home working and extra spacings in offices/ workplaces. That said, many companies have seen a drop off in orders so they are closing for economic reasons rather than (direct) health ones. Schools are slowing going back with some classes. In 4 weeks after the pentecost holidays, all schools will be back for all pupils BUT with smaller classes which essentially means most will be balancing days of school attendance and days of home schooling. Hotels and campsites will be opening just in time for the pentecost holiday fortnight , but with reduced capacity and special hygene measure. So.... its far from normal but its slowly becoming less restrictive."
"""The situation as of today is that outdoor seating at restaurants and bars can open with adequate spacing between tables and customer contact details are being recorded in case it is needed for contact tracing""Certainly good news but then again having a face covering is the new norm it seems."
"> having a face covering is the new norm it seems.It is and will be until this virus issue goes away. Its all simple science and down to the fact that you can have the virus without knowing it, plus the fact that it reproduces like crazy in the early stages in your upper throat, so you can be spewing contagious mucous all over the place, but with a mask that limits it. I think at this stage most people know that you are being asked or ordered to wear a mask in order to stop others getting infected, on the off chance that you have it and dont know, but its no harm to mention it again. Anyhow to add to the update, the Bavarian government has removed the need from quarantine from all EU + EEA + UK arrivals since last Saturday Source : https:/…RzLMEfuThe land borders remain semi-closed, allowing people travelling on reasonable grounds/ essential travel to cross , but no day tripper tourism allowed quite just yet - the plan is that the border checks will be removed completely on June 15th"
It looks promising. I'm hoping now to be able to travel by train through Germany (onwards to Poland) in early July.
"In terms of travel between the U.K. and Germany.Despite the U.K. being set to quarantine anyone arriving from outside the U.K. and Ireland for 14 days from later this month, this looks like it will only be a short term measure in regards countries who are deemed to have control of the virus.https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/news.sky.com/…I’m therefore expecting travel between the U.K. and Germany to be possible without any quarantine at some point this summer."
"@Munich_Wanderer, great points regarding masks. I really wish the U.K. government would stop dragging their heels and make their use mandatory in public places such as shops buses, trains etc. There’s probably no more than about 5% of the people in the city I live using them at present."
The only problem being is if other countries deem us as a threat.
"Just to add to what was already mentioned above on rollbacks of restrictions, the bavarian government had a press conference earlier this afternoon and announced a number or measures. Among whats planned for Saturday May 30th, hotels in bavaria can open fully in a couple so long as the rooms are en-suite rooms, castles are opening to the public (with a few days delay for busy ones like Neuschwanstein), boat trips on the lakes are starting up again, theme parks can open. Non tourist related news is that the womens football Bundesliga and mens Basketball bundesliga are to restart - interestingly the basketball being decided by a 10 team mini tournament in Munich seemingly aided by the large amount of empty hotels in the city ! Some classes are already back in school and all will be back after the midterm break in some shape or form. Kindergardens are to start up again, starting with the oldest class to allow them to prepare for the jump to real school in September. Any further moves will be in 3 week intervals, allowing for analysis of how the previous measures went. I am just mentioning some of the non touristy things so people get a feel for the pace of the return to some sort of normality in Germany."
"""The only problem being is if other countries deem us as a threat.""Us as in England or Germany?"
"UK. There has been talks of countries with low infection rates in the EU being able to travel, but we are not in the EU. And currently we have 248,293 cases."
"@Travel Addict, that figure is the total amount of confirmed cases recorded since the Pandemic began not the current number of active cases. Unlike other Countries the U.K. does not publish figures for recovered cases.The important figures to look at are the number of confirmed new daily cases and the number of those currently hospitalised. Despite the government’s absolutely awful management of the crisis both of these numbers are now falling.Another key thing to look at over the coming weeks and months is the R number. Providing this remains below 1 then it means infections are reducing and that will be key when it comes to the lifting of restrictions when travelling to other countries.Something else to be aware is that although the U.K. is no longer officially a member of the EU, during the transition period it is still subject to EU rules and part of the EEA."
Ah thanks for clearing that up!We are moving towards level 3 from 4 I heard from business leaders the other day. I'm feeling more confident about August for sure after reading your post.
I think the chances of being able to visit Germany from the U.K. without quarantine either side by August is starting to look like a genuine possibility. Personally I have mixed feelings about my trip to Köln. I go there at least once sometimes twice a year for football and Kolsch. I won’t be able to watch a game this time and I’m expecting some of my favourite Brauhaus’s to be closed and the whole experience of eating and drinking out to be markedly different to previous visits.I’m also quite nervous about going through an airport and getting on a plane. A big part of me won’t be too sad if travel restrictions are still in place come August. If they aren’t I will make a call on whether to go or not nearer the time.
But Dean - do you have to fly? Is going by your own car and ferry a viable alternative to you?
"Hi Blandine, No overland it’s an option for me. I haven’t driven for many years and don’t own a car. My partner does but she doesn’t have the confidence to drive on roads outside the U.K."
"Dean: Germany dropped quarantine for people arriving from EU+ this week. It's still recommended, but it's not required. Third countries have a requirement."
Can you provide a link for this please Darren.
See under „quarantine“ on the website of the Ministry of the Interior: https:/…coronavirus-faqs.html
UK quarantine measures going to be announced later today according to the BBC.
Quarantine rule going to be checked every 3 weeks starting from 8th June.
"So, the latest....From today, inside areas of restaurants in Bavaria are allowed to be opened, following on from the opening of terraces and beergardens last week - note, theres very strict spacing regulations which have slashed beergarden capacity, for instance the Chinese tower is down from 7000 guests to just 700. Members of 2 households can meet and share a table, but they (as a group) must be an adequate distance from the next. Theres other regulations like menus and tables being disinfected after each customer, toilets being disinfected multiple times over the day etc..... so much work required that some places will not bother opening at all as they need more staff and can only serve half the amount of customers. As maybe mentioned above, already opened are museums, the open air parts of zoos and all shops, some school kids are back and in the next weeks theme parks, hotels, and eventually swimming pools will be opening, with all school kids returning mid June on a week on week off basis. Theres been a couple of high profile potential setbacks in relaxing of regulations with a large outbreak associated with a baptist church service in Frankfurt and a restaurant opening in Lower Saxony with over a dozen positive tests so far and 100+ people in quarantine in both cases . The news coming out now is that the church goers seem to have had (dangerously) close social contact after the service itsself and the restaurant allegedly (according to eyewitnesses) didn't implement the social distancing properly with hugs and handshakes all round and no strict enforcement of mask regulations for staff or patrons. Other notable major outbreaks recently were associated with meat plants which are also a special case in that contract migrant workers live in overly cramped communial accomodation, and similarly a few cases in asylum seeker accomodation and care homes. So all in all, things are chugging along nicely with the gradual easing of restrictions not leading to any increase in cases that might jeopardise further moves."
"EDIT, the baptist church has released a press statement where they confirm that they had the distancing and disinfectant measures in place BUT in hindsight they might have been wiser to have wore masks and to not have collective group singing. Now.... if they were to have listened to the advice of the main churches and the ministeral conference 2 weeks earlier they would have been aware of the high risks associated with loud collective congregational singing (I hesitate to believe that a baptist church sang quietly, and if they did, I would tend to belive that they would likely have mentioned this fundamental sacrifice on their behalf) - https:/…gottesdienste-111.html This though again just goes to show that we can look forward to some sort of tourist summer and that relaxation of the lockdown can be done safely if hygene and distancing rules are followed, as only the odd outlyer where rules/ guidelines are broken are causing notable outbreaks.Edited: 10:35 am, May 25, 2020 "
"Just a quick update: Thanks to a court decision this morning just relating to Augsburg city, to avoid confusion and further legal actions the Bavarian government has decided to implement the ruling across Bavaria that beergardens and outdoor seating at restaurants can open until 10pm , just as is the case for indoors areas. It was due to be introduced on Tuesday, but is now a few days earlier. Austria has just extended their restaurant hours to 1am, and Bavaria is a few weeks behind them in opening measures, so we can expect that to be a move in a few weeks. Upcoming milestones in Bavaria which enters a 2 week school holiday now (period including 2 public holidays so you can take 8 days off work for a 16 day break), are the opening of hotels tomorrow as well as boat trips on lakes and rivers, swimming pools in a week, and finally once the holiday fortnight is over the borders to Austria / Switzerland and France will return to normal with no checks. In general, aside from a few clusters (a UPS Depot near Hannover, yet another independent protestant church this time in Bremerhafen, a few asylum seeker homes) the spread of the virus seems to be dampened down and tapering out somewhat, for now at least. Europe is moving towards allowing more travel inside Europe from mid-June or early July, a move seen as necessary for a number of reasons like solidarity between northern and southern (tourism dependent) nations, help for the tourism and airline industries across europe which have been in shutdown for the past months, and to an extent a reward for the citizens of Europe for their compliance with the restrictions which now seem to have worked. Of course this is all only possible as the infection numbers look good, and is subject to that continuing to improve, and host countries like Greece, Italy and Spain are implementing hygene and distancing measures to minimise risk. There has though been little talk or appetite for allowing non essential longer distance travel, incoming or outgoing, in the immediate or medium term. Anyone from the USA or other places outside of Europe with a planned holiday in Munich, Germany or Europe for this summer probably should not hold out too much hope of it being permitted to go ahead.Edited: 11:14 am, May 29, 2020 "
"munich_wonderer, thanks for the info. Am not holding out much hope to do our Sept trip. Will keep monitoring the government advisory sites and perhaps catch a lucky break. First country to open up will get my business. Unfortunately in our local area, we're experience a bit of a second wave (or really extension of the initial)."
The waves will continue if people don't social distance
"the next stage of easings in Munich & Bavaria has kicked in today. For tourists, not a lot really of benefit. Open air pools can open, as can fitness and dance studios. Sports teams can train with up to 20 at a time, but without any contact and keeping their distance. Last week theme parks and the like opened with reduced capacity and all (from what I can see) now require advance online booking of tickets - which also means no good deals with coupons or the likes! The land border controls are being dropped next Monday but they are already somewhat relaxed. From what I gather people travelling to italy had no problems travelling out of Germany and through Austria. As posted above, beergardens have opened and even indoors in restaurants can open, but with massive restrictions on the amount of tables/ people possible and only people from 2 households can meet and sit at a table. The restrictions are so restrictive and customer numbers so low that some places like the Park Cafe or Hofbraukeller have decided that they cannot operate to a break even level, let alone make profit, so are closing completely or just opening on warm sunny days.Edited: 3:55 am, June 08, 2020 "
"munich wanderer, do you know if people from different households, for example 2 couples, can drive in one car to Italiy? Or would this be a problem if controlled?"
"Regarding munich to Italy travel. I have no clue. There’s no checks now anyhow so nobody will be checking Anyhow, tomorrow June 22nd theres another batch of restrictions removed in BavariaCultural events can now happen with 100 people indoors, 200 outdoors. Bus tours are back running (mask wearing compulsory) , indoor pools and saunas can open, and already since the 19th there’s no early closing for bars and restaurants. Infection numbers in Germany were very high in the past few days thanks to a massive outbreak at a meat plant near Gütersloh (north of Dortmund) , but that aside the virus infections levels are generally stable if not reducing and there should be more relaxing of restrictions as time goes on"
Great news regarding UK citizens. Bring on August!
Is Dachau Concentration Camp open to visit?
"@Travel Addict, nothing has been confirmed yet. Probably best to wait until the official announcement on Monday. Although some sources are reporting Germany will be on the list others don’t seem quite so sure."
Can you eat at a restaurant with 4 people from different hoseholds? As tourists?
""" Probably best to wait until the official announcement on Monday. ""That would bring waves of people as well."
"BBC have reported that its very likely that Germany will be including. I would be suprised if they are not, everything has been booked since early March anyway so all I can do is wait. Positive signs though."
"@Travel addict, yes seems very likely but it is not yet confirmed.@Jordans Bulls, what are you talking about?"
"just a quick update that things are progressing nicely at the moment. Restaurants, museums etc are opened with the various measures in place (masks worn on way to table or walking round in a museum) , masks on public transport etc and no effects have been reported. Cinemas have reopened and theaters can reopen but I havent any info on whether they have done that yet. Theres reports that the wearing of masks at your seat will no longer be needed soon, so another good move. In restaurants, the rules are more relaxed and members of more than 2 households can meet. In Munich corona infection rates continue at a low rate of less than 100 cases per week, so its there but not increasing. https:/…Coronavirus-Fallzahlen.html Elsewhere in Germany, cases have risen but as I mentioned earlier, this is a small background general infection rate being boosted by large numbers of (mainly containable) specific large localised outbreaks in meat plants or close knit (obviously too close knit!!) communities. looking ahead to christmas markets, theres no announcement on whats happening there but it is on the agenda with the politicans to get some sort of decision made over the summer. I get the feeling that they are nervous to allow them happen as normal, but it was mentioned by one cabinet minister that ""small"" (less touristy?) ones are seen as something which needs to be given approval for. I also (personal experience) think that the main city centre ones are so crowded at the best of times to the point of being worryingly overcrowded and dangerous from a crowd control point of view, so surely with corona requiring some sort of distance they cannot get the go ahead in their normal size/ density? One article mentions the end of August as being a date where decisions really need to be made by, so thats possibly a timeframe for a decision, at the very latest."
All confirmed. See you in August :)
Lufthansa have altered flight times which are no good to me. So now i'm not going!
"> Lufthansa have altered flight times which are no good to me. So now i'm not going!maybe call them to see if they'll route you a different way at a better time. Lufthansa group have also flights to Zurich, Geneva, Frankfurt, Vienna, even Brussels, with connections onwards to Munich which they could switch you onto, if they press the right button on the computer for you !"
"They gave me the option to accept the new flight details or cancel and have a refund. I have chosen the latter, always another time I suppose."
"I’m due to travel into Memmimgen August 22nd for a week but have no accommodation booked yet as we don’t know which town to choose.Looking for something that’s open aired, not overly busy but with plenty options for things to do. Would Oberstdorf fit the bill? Any other recommendations that are easy to get to from Memmimgen airport. Our 5 year old daughter will be with us so need to have things to keep her happy too....."
"Oberstdorf will be very busy as it is peak hiking season. If you can still get accomodation there it would be my first choice, though. It is fairly walkable and by bus you can easily get to trailheads and surrounding attractions. Fischen or Sonthofen should also work as base. Just make sure that you don't book in some remote village unless you have a rental car."
"@Travel Addict, we have now had something similar happen for our trip to Köln which was on the same weekend as your trip to Munich.We were due to fly to Düsseldorf on Friday morning and then take the train to Köln, returning on the Monday afternoon. We’ve now been told our flight out has been moved back 12 hours to Friday night meaning we wouldn’t get to Köln until after midnight and our flight back has been moved forward to 7am Monday morning so we would have had to leave our hotel in the middle of night.Absolutely no point in going now as we would have had one full day on Saturday. We were flying with Eurowings but they did not offer us a refund only a credit if we cancelled. I’ve therefore had to write to them to request the amount be refunded.Luckily the hotel in Köln is refundable. Still hoping to get away that weekend but we don’t have many option due to flight times looks like either Paris or Copenhagen."
"The fare I had chosen was non refundable, i'm hoping they will be see sense and offer me a voucher or a refund. Airport parking was also non refundable but they have offered me a voucher worth the amount paid to be used by July 2021, which I thought was generous. My hotel was free cancellation. I will go down the route of travel insurance on flights if possible as flights were around £308.Have emailed Lufthansa, still waiting on a reply if i'm eligible for a refund."
"just another update, The bavarian cabinet met this morning and has a load of changes coming into effect tomorrow.They are allowing private parties of 100 indoors or 200 outdoors (ok, not of any use to tourists.... but useful to guage where bavaria is at) Theatres and whatnot have the same restrictions, even if they are large venues and could hold more. River cruises will be allowed now under the same rules as hotels. Excursions on rivers still require a mask, but no distance regulations. Indoor playgrounds and indoor areas in theme parks and zoos can now open (no mention of masks, I presume they are needed) The best news of all, football trainings can now take place as normal !"
Update. Lufthansa are going to refund me the full cost. Fair play to them
"@Travel Addict, pleased you got a result perhaps you can look at going somewhere else?Eurowings have now changed our flight again! We are now scheduled to fly Friday afternoon and come back mid morning Monday. We’ve still lost a big chunk of our first day but we will get 2 full days and a few hours on Friday night so will probably end up going now situation permitting!"
For next year yes. Already been let down on a trip to Dublin this year thanks to Covid. So will probably keep it saved to go somewhere next year.
Update. Refund due to be processed. Normally takes 7days for a credit card does it? They sent the email in German. Thank god for google translate!
"it can do, but it will likely be quicker. They just need to manage expectations."
