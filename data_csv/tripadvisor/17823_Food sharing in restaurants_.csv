"I don't think it's rude or inappropriate, and no one is going to stop you doing it. I can't say what other diners or staff might think, but a lot will probably depend on what type of establishment it is."
Restaurants serving small sharing plates are popular here. We usually go to those sort of places. Otherwise if your companions are ordering main meals explain that you would just like a starter. I also do that. Obviously if this is a high end restaurant they would expect you to order a main course (costs) but casual places are fine I find.
"Yes, the more casual the eatery, the less chance that anyone will care what you do. My wife and I usually share our food and no one bats an eyelid. If anyone secretly thinks it's wrong, then I don't care!"
"It's not common to share a main course, portions are generally not American size.Most places would let you order a starter, just make it clear that you want it to come with your companions main courses."
"There is pressure on restaurants in the UK to reduce portion sizes because of the obesity epidemic and food waste, not that they are generally American-size. Doggie bags are not common here. No one is going to worry if you share your food."
"Depends what you mean by sharing. No it's not common to buy one course and share it (restaurants, even pubs are unliketly to provide plates/cutlery to eat it), but if you order something small as well as the main order there's no reason why you can't share a bit. Tapas restaurants (and quite a few places now serve food tapas style) may be the way to go rather than pubs and there are lots of casual chains like Leon, Pret etc where it's easy to buy as much or as little as you feel comfy eating.Edited: 1 year ago "
"6oz is 170g. To illustrate what has been said above about portion sizes, I just checked a Marks and Spencer microwave ready meal (meat and vegetables) in my fridge - it is 225g. This is the same size as a typical non-hearty restaurant portion, and I don't think any member of your family is going to be too happy if you take roughly 75% of their meal.I echo the suggestion of trying tapas-style or sharing plates restaurants, which will allow you to try several different dishes without eating too much. Otherwise having a starter only might work. Or order a main course if you want to - it is quite OK to leave anything you can't eat. Or you can donate your leftovers to the more voracious members of your family - while it's a bit uncivilised I confess it is something my family does at casual restaurants."
"In a pub you will be fine, no one will mind.The more upmarket expensive restaurants would probably not like it, but their portions are so small your eating partner would not be happy either!Sometimes, when my husband has a main course in a pub, I will order a starter and a desert, this is effectively one meal shared by two."
"I agree that it would only be an issue in higher end places, they'll not tolerate two people eating one meal. Anywhere else it's perfectly fine... I was in a Carluccio's in Kensington the other day and my partner and I did just this."
I see people sharing a pizza at Franco Mancas all the time.
"I quite often order a starter as a main course, then I can manage dessert."
