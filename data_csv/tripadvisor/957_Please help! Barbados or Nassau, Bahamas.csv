"I am planning to move to Barbados or Bahamas for four months and I am struggling to choose which one would fit better with my needs. I am in my 20s and I am very outgoing so I prefer if there is a good nightlife environment, where I could make friends my age. I also would like to scuba dive as much as I can and visit beautiful beaches. Ideally, which island offers a good combination of nightlife/nature activities?"
When are you looking to do this? Hopefully you understand that nightlife/mingling/dining and other activities are currently greatly impacted by COVID-19 and related restrictions.
"Yes! I am aware of that. I guess the question is not entirely directed in the right way, but more to where would I get a good balance between beautiful beaches and a normal lifestyle, not something that is far away from everyone else."
