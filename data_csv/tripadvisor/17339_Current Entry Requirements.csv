"I understand citizens and permanent residents from certain Schengen countries (e.g., Germany) can enter Slovenia via Austria at certain approved border points (like the Karawanks Tunnel).What I am not clear on is whether travelers are required to show proof of accommodation reservations.Can any of you verify if such proof is currently required?"
"We have 2 list of countries: a green one and a red one. And the third one, so called ""yellow list"" for all other countries.Here is the link to ""green"" countries: https://www.nijz.si/sl/seznam-drzav-za-preha… - citizens or residents of those countries are allowed to enter Slovenia without any restrictions (aka no quarantine), from any of the bordering countries. No proof of accommodation reservation is needed.Here is the link to latest version published in official Gazette: https://www.uradni-list.si/glasilo-uradni-li… - there is no mention of ""booking or reservation"" requirement proof for those coming from ""green countries"".The situation is fluid, countries are added or removed from those two lists almost overnight."
"And one more link, this one in English (similar to the one you have for Croatia):https://www.policija.si/eng/newsroom/news-ar…"
