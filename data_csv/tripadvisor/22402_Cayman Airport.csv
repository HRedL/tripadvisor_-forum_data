"We fly out tomorrow (3/20) back the states. For those of who have already flown home since the announcement, how are the security lines at the airport? Trying decide how much time to a lot for. I don’t want longer than needed."
"We flew back yesterday. Only 3 families in security line but it took forever. Half of us had our bags rescreened which took a long time. I would arrive at least 2 hours prior.Edited: 8:38 am, March 19, 2020 "
