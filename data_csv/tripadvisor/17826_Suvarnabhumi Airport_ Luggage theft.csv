"Just a warning to all about theft of luggage (and from luggage) at Suvarnabhumi Airport. Of course this happens at most airport, but the really troubling thing in Bangkok is that no-one takes the problem seriously - except the person who has been robbed! The airlines, the airport authority and the police all just play ""pass the parcel"" in terms of who is responsible for even just investigating each incident (let alone trying to actually catch those responsible). My wife and I passed through BKK in transit from Krabi to Chiang Mai. We became separated from our luggage and by the time we got it back (2 days later) it had been opened and many items stolen.We immediately lodged reports with the airline and police. The airline came back and said their best guess was that it was stolen by luggage handlers employed by an airport contractors, but that only the airport authority could investigate the matter. We duly lodged a report with them and waited, and waited. Now a month later (and after much follow up on our part) we have only brief verbal feedback that the airport authority feels that theft from luggage is the responsibility of the airlines.We have since searched online to find many other people in our position, many of whom commented on the lack of responsiveness of the relevant authorities. There have been some stats in the BKK newspapers showing increasing rates of theft since this airport opened, but I strongly suspect that actual rates of theft are MUCH greater. In closing I would strongly recommend locking and wrapping bags if you pass through this airport. Also remember, if they can take things out, they can put things in!"
"Bruce, thanks for the warning,can I ask how you became ""separated"" from your luggage? If the airline lost it or it never got onto the carousel there's not much anyone can do to avoid it and I guess you're right when you say it happens at every airport."
"Hi OK, we got separated from our luggage as follows:Thai Air Asia delayed their departure from Krabi over an hour making it almost certain we would miss our connecting flight to CNX. They hadn't advised us and as we had our (unhappy) baby with us this was a real pain. They then offered to make sure our luggage was taken on to Chiang Mai that evening so that we could run from plane to plane in BKK. On this basis we accepted their kind offer. We made the connecting flight, and we also checked with Thai Air Asia staff in both BKK and CNX with regards to our luggage being in CNX that night (27 Feb). Alas, not to be. To cut a long story short now, the bags apparently sat in BKK for some time. Finally we collected them from CNX airport on 1 March, but when I lift one case off the trolley it is noticeably lighter than when I last lifted it. We then spend a lot of time with Thai Air Asia staff, hear one story about what happened to our bags, write a report and make it clear we want the matter investigated, & get shown some ""fine-print"" that means they are not responsible. We then lodge a report with CNX police, who suggest we go back to Bangkok to report it to the police there (because that's where it happened).We pursue the matter with Thai Air Asia and get told story number two about what happened to our bags. They name the contractor company whose staff (they say) probably stole our things. They even suggest where it may have happened (a luggage elevator in which no video camera has been fitted). This is where we were told that we needed to pursue the matter via ""Airports of Thailand"", the company that runs BKK airport (and who presumably employ the contractors). We email a report to them (AOT) and follow up with a phone call and so begins the merry chase. And four weeks later the chase goes on. With not one word in writing from Airports of Thailand."
"Hi,This may be a silly question ,but were you bags locked or did they just break them and enter, so to speak?Thanks"
HI Interesting that Air Asia said they would make sure your bags followed you.everytime I have flown them they always tell me they are a point to point airline and they do aboslutely no baggage transfer.their Web site also states no baggage transfer.did they have a third party moving your bags?
"Did you have travel Insurance? as this would have covered you for any loss, insurance is the one thing I make sure of before travelling.hervey"
"Although I certainly sympathize with this situation, it should be understood that some of the purported thefts/pilferings occur long before the luggage arrives in Thailand. A growing problem is related to inter-airline baggage transfers at some hubs. For example if you are flying to BKK from the east coast and transiting via LAX, the luggage may not make the transfer or have an attempted pilfer. This happened to me recently. While the ticketing airline suggested the event took place in BKK, the baggage tracing showed it occurred in LAX. "
"Hi all, Some good and relevant points noted,1. Bags not locked (don't think we haven't kicked ourselves already). Normally we do but this was just a day trip for us so we did not worry this time.2. No Thai Air Asia did not have to make that offer and we did not ask for or expect it. Nevertheless if they hadn't made the offer I would have stayed in BKK to fetch the bags (and caught a later flight) and sent the missus and little one on to CNX on the booked flight. They told us THEY would take the bags on THEIR last flight to CNX that day. As it turned out - when the bags we finally taken to CNX - they were transported by One-Two-Go (as a favour to Thai Air Asia). And yes we spoke with them also but they firmly stated that the bags were taken to their plane (and from their plane) by staff of Thai Air Asia.3. No we didn't have insurance. Insurance would have fixed our problem I guess, but only exacerbates the broader problem of luggage theft as it means that people don't bother complaining or pushing for action. Easy for all concerned, even the thieves, in the short term.4. The location of the theft was confirmed by the variation in weight of the suitcase in question. Nevertheless there are a lot of variables and people involved making it very easy for people to point fingers in all directions and just generally not bother doing anything. Again, a boon for the thieves.Since writing my post I also noticed an item in the BKK Post about Airports of Thailand haven't paid the company that provides security services to the BKK airport, not since the airport opened last year. This is because they say the firm has not provided the number of quards that they stated they would in their contract.The fact that Airports of Thailand doesn't even see the need to be SEEN to go through the motions (ie. a short letter to us saying they will meet with the luggage contractor to discuss the incident) really is pretty appalling."
"Dateline: Bangkok, February 26, 2007 0800 hrs Thai TimeBeware of thieves at Suvarnabhumi AirportUp to 415 theft cases were reported to a tourist-service centre in the past several months.""Thieves targeted notebook computers and cameras,"" Pol Lt Col Thammawat Hirunyalekha, an inspector at the centre, said Sunday.According to him, of the total thefts reported, 152 cases were about items missing in the airport, 152 about items missing while on board, and 101 about items missing outside the airport's compound.The number of theft reports at the unit has climbed from just nine in September, to 54 in October, 72 in November, 101 in December and 114 in January.The Nation Newspaper, Bangkok"
"Hi Bruce,Thanks for your post. We will certainly take care of locking the cases and keeping the valuables with us. Cheers,April"
"We are another victim of theft at Suvarnabhumi. Two weeks ago, my wife had her iPod charger stolen from an unlocked pocket on her soft-sided bag that was checked in. It was just the charger and not the iPod (which she carried with her), so they are obviously stealing just about anything that seems of value. Theft seems to be an increasing problem at Sunvarnabhumi, so be careful. And if Suvranabhumi is employing contractor baggage handlers that cannot be trusted, it makes me wonder about how secure things are in there where one of them might want to put something dangerous IN a bag rather than taking something out.I remember a ""sting"" operation (including hidden cameras, undercover agents) at the old Don Muang airport about three years ago where many baggage handlers were arrested and apparently things got better for a while. Perhaps it is time for the Thai police to organise another sting operation."
"We do our annual US/ Asia trip & since 9/11 have been in the habit of not locking our suitcases after numerous instances of being requested that they stay open for random inspection in various airports. In fact, we just arrived here in Alaska a few days ago & was asked by Alaska Air whether our suicases were locked. We make sure that our laptop is always with hubby's carry on, kids' IPods are on them as a safety precaution. All valuable as a rule are always with us.It is quite troubling to think that this is happening a whole lot more. We travel to the Phil quite a bit & have heard about the same issue although we have been thankfully spared of the trauma to date. We are scheduled to arrive in BKK in July from Tokyo & am wondering if it would be best to lock our checked in suitcases. The bigger question is whether we would be allowed to lock our checked in baggage."
"BMTTOKYO - if you are departing from a USA airport, it is still possible to lock your bags with a ""TSA approved"" lock. With these locks, security can open the lock with some sort of master key, and hopefully these keys have been kept secure by them. Another alternative that might help would be to lock your bags with plastic cable ties. At least any prospective thief would have to cut them to gain access to your bag."
"umm.. now that u mentioned, i wen to back bangkok couple of mths back, had a JUNK FOOD key chain tagged onto my luggage that went missing. i found it slightly weird since it has accompanied me to a couple of countries b4, but i attributed it to rough handling.i meant for me this is a small insignificant loss, but theft at the BKK airport i guess is mounting to quite a serious issue.i guess all travellin to BKK shd take note and take extra precaution. anyway, it is not a good time to travel to bangkok now ;("
Why is it not a good time to travel to Bangkok now?
"awwwhat he probably means is that the current government is a military junta. there was a coup here last september (bloodless). since then the government has been jumping from mini crisis to mini crisis plus some bombs went off at new year in BKK killing 3 people. you tend to find in SE Asian countries that people won't travel here when this sort of political instability is happening. they take a wait and see approach or go elsewhere, unlike western travellers who are prepared to weigh up the risks and usually travel."
from what ive read on other boards its very quiet in bankok and pattaya -not as many travellers going there for some reason(i think we can guess the reason)
that's terrible..
"Sounds like a problem. I will be in the BKK airport in a couple of weeks.On another note, this problem is not exclusive to BKK, obviously. I was once flying from Mexico City to Boston, MA, with a transfer in Chicago. The person I was with got back to Boston to find that some AMEX Travelers Checks were missing from a side pocket on her bag (by the way, I had told her that there is no need for Travelers Checks now that we have ATMs in every country, but she insisted).She found out that the checks were cashed at a location in Chicago, about 5 miles from the airport. AMEX gave her a very hard time about this, despite the fact that the signatures were not even close to a match of her signature. She spent a lot of time writing a letter to AMEX, detailing that there was no way she could have left the Chicago airport, jumped in a taxi to the location where they were cashed, then returned in a taxi to go through security and get on her plane all in a matter of the 45 minute layover we had.AMEX finally agreed to refund the money, and they even gave her an extra $20 for her troubles. That said, that was the last time she ever used Travelers Checks. The fact that she had to fight AMEX to get this money back defeats the purpose of having the checks to begin with.Clearly someone who worked at the Chicago airport had an agreement with a store vendor who would let him cash stolen Travelers checks."
"<<That said, that was the last time she ever used Travelers Checks. The fact that she had to fight AMEX to get this money back defeats the purpose of having the checks to begin with.>>Don't you think that witlessly packing travellers cheques - which are the next step to cash - in a side pocket of a piece of checked luggage might rightfully be seen by the issuer of the cheques as gross negligence? I'm surprised she got refunded at all. "
"A relatively old thread. Hopefully, an old problem now gone away."
"""Don't you think that witlessly packing travellers cheques - which are the next step to cash - in a side pocket of a piece of checked luggage might rightfully be seen by the issuer of the cheques as gross negligence? I'm surprised she got refunded at all.""Ummm, I'd say gross negligence is a bit strong, but whatever floats your boat captain.Surprised? Then what exactly is the purpose of a Travelers Check? I don't care if you dropped it on the street, which I assume you would also consider ""gross negligence"". The signatures don't match, it's forgery and you get a refund. End of story, or at least it should be. Same thing with Credit Cards. You issue a charge back for fraudulent charges. If it's not the end of the story, then one might as well stick to using cash.Travelers Checks and Credit Cards offer consumer protection from theft and forgery. If you want to stay in the 20th Century, nobody is stopping you from enjoying your Travelers Checks.By the way, from the Amex website on Travelers Checks:""Refundable if lost or stolen.""""American Express Travelers Cheques are safer than cash. If they are ever lost or stolen, the funds can be replaced virtually anywhere in the world,usually within 24 hours.""Later! LOL"
"I have a thought about the possibility of losing your luggage on arrival.When those bags are on the belts, who ever can pick up 1 or 2 bags and go. No one checks if the bags are actually yours."
"land premier,You're right no one checks if it is your bag when you walk out the airport. That's pretty scary. We try to make sure that we get to the belt before the luggage does. We put a bright ribbon on our luggage so that we can spot it quickly and you'd need a knife or scissors to cut it off.I wanted to a buy a shocking pink suitcase so that it's easier to spot our suitcase, but husband said no way. He doesn't want to be seen carrying a pink suitcase.Even in Singapore no one checked our bags when we exited the airport.Australia is quite strict, and they have checked that we have only our bags."
"I think losing your luggage through theft at the luggage carousel is highly ulikely. Firstly it would have to be a fellow passenger or an employee authorised to be in that area. Secondly, you are foolhardy enough to advertise that the contents of a case are worth stealing by using expensive designer luggage for instance but even then it doesn't follow that the contents are going to be expensive. Most folks put their valuables, jewelry, photographic items etc. into their hand luggage so a spculative thief is taking a big risk compared with the potential reward. I think those countries/airports which actually match passengers with their luggage do so as part of security checks rather than for theft. Certainly that was the case when we toured Australia last year when we were only asked once whether the luggage we were collecting was ours and that was a spot check at Brisbane Airport. "
"I believe most people will put what they buy during the holiday in the checked luggage among the clothes. A fellow passenger might take your bag so he has 2 to go.There was one time after the flight from Phu Quoc Island to Ho Chi Minh City, they checked every passenger’s luggage with the luggage tag. That was very annoying after a flight before we exited but I understand why they did that.Lulufluff,LOL at your pink suitcase idea hahahahahha. I myself feel a bit worry when I use my nice luggage. Excellent bright ribbon tip. Thank you."
"hey LandieI found in every airport except HCMC when we first got there, they checked our luggage & made sure it matched up to our tickets. They did check the tickets at HCMC when we flew back in from Hanoi though.I'm sure they've never checked here in Australia.Cant remember if they did last yr in Phuket?"
They check it in the Philippines. I don't think they checked it in Singapore and Australia.
"Hey Reddie and Coolitz,Except the time I just listed which was back in 2004, they never checked in Suvarnabhumi, Hanoi, HCMC and budget terminal in Singapore. That’s why I’m worried I may lose my bag anytime.Off-topic a bit, only in July this year in the new terminal in HCMC, they scanned our luggage before we entered the terminal. In Swampie, we just went straight to the check in counter. What if someone brings a bomb? Do the gates have auto bomb detectors?"
"""Off-topic a bit, only in July this year in the new terminal in HCMC, they scanned our luggage before we entered the terminal. In Swampie, we just went straight to the check in counter. What if someone brings a bomb? Do the gates have auto bomb detectors?""*In the Philippines when you enter the international terminal they scan the luggage before you get to the counters.*You have to be careful on buses too! Don't put money or travelers checks or valuable jewelry in the checked in bag, especially on buses chartered in the Khao San Road area! Good advice for any bus travel in any country - keep valuables with you at your seat or near your seat within view!"
"As a follow-up to this post, theft from luggage is alive and well at the airport in Bangkok. I was there last week, and someone I know had several items stolen from her luggage. The suitcase was locked. They clipped the zipper rings (the holes on the zipper where you attach the lock) and took what they wanted.Sad that they can't fix this issue."
"Regarding the posts about checking baggage tags against tickets:I have flown into Manila (Terminal 1) dozens of times and never once had my baggage tags checked. Same goes for Singapore. Actually, I live in Asia and travel very frequently to nearly every major airport in Asia and I have never had my baggage tags checked against my ticket at any airport.I recently took a trip to the USA and there were no checks at two different airports there as well. And regarding baggage pilfering at BKK, it's happened to me as well. In my case, they didn't even cut the lock (a four digit combination lock), but stupid me, I put my camera in my bag and it was gone when I arrived at my hotel in Seoul following a flight from BKK. To be fair, it could have happened in Seoul, but with the speed at which my bags arrived on the carousel at ICN, I doubt it happened there. I have also been told by American friends with those ""TSA"" locks that they have had baggage pilfered at BKK without the lock being cut. Since these are key logs, apparently the baggage thieves at BKK have the master keys.And be careful- this is not just happened in Asia. Two people were arrested at LAX for baggage theft just last week. More than 30 people have been arrested at LAX in the first eight months of 2008. But at least LAX are doing something about it, apparently contrary to what is happening at BKK where nothing seems to being done.www.aero-news.net/index.cfm…"
I’m sure you all have seen how they open your luggage with a pen when you lock it:www.youtube.com/watch…
What evidence do you have that the theft happened in Bangkok and not somewhere else along the way?
"""What evidence do you have that the theft happened in Bangkok and not somewhere else along the way?""We were flying from Malé, Maldives to Phuket, via Bangkok. Bags were checked through to Phuket when we departed Maldives.However, when in Bangkok we were walking by the luggage collection and noticed my friends bag (it is a very distinct bag). Thought it was strange, but we figured they made a mistake and had sent all of the bags out in Bangkok so we waited for my bag. However, my bag never came through. We talked to an airline rep, who said that my friend's bag should not have been sent to baggage claims in Bangkok. She then called an airport employee over to get my friends bag to send it on it's way to Phuket. While waiting for the employee to come pick up the bag, my friend noticed that the lock was missing from her bag. They had not popped the lock, rather they used clippers to cut the loops on the zipper so the quality of lock would not have mattered. They had gone into the bag and ripped open a ziplock bag and taken 3 cell phones and a camera charger (I later told my friend that she should never have included electronics in checked luggage, as is posted throughout the Bangkok airport due to this problem of theft).The fact that the luggage was sent to the baggage claim area in Bangkok instead of being sent straight through to Phuket as it should have been is a rather clear indication that someone in Bangkok removed the bag from it's course, stole the items, and then sent it out to baggage claim figuring that someone would eventually send it off to Phuket when nobody claimed the luggage.It seems as though someone who is X-Raying the luggage in Bangkok must be involved and they probably mark the bags which contain electronics in a certain way so the baggage handlers know which bags to pull aside and steal from. My bag, which only had clothing packed, was not touched.Anyway, it was a mistake checking electronics and a lesson she has learned. Fortunately it was only a few cell phones and a camera charger and not something with more monetary value.Just another warning to all who will be flying through Bangkok. Do not check anything of value, and do not think that a quality lock will protect you. They will simply cut the loops on the zipper."
