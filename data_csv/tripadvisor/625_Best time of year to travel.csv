Put aside the covid-19 reasons.....we usually travel south in feb/mar. What is the weather like in oct/nov/dec?
"That's our 2020 current plan too. First time for November, maybe?"
"We usually stay on the Caribbean Sea coast in December, January or February as the Atlantic side can be cool then!"
I would say asap at this point :) Nov.'s looking pretty good right now :)
"Yes, a little warmer on the Caribbean side so you increase your odds you don't hit with a cold snap.Depending on where you live, there may not be direct flights from your nearest airport to Cuba until January or so. Connecting flights are always a crap shoot in winter time if you live in a winter clime like Canada."
"I've been in mid to late October until early to mid November quite a few times the last 8-9 years. You can get some rain for a few days then,( but not always ) apart from that the weather has been great, hot, sunny and the ocean is very warm.A couple of years ago I was there late October to mid November ( 3 weeks ) it was the best weather I have ever experienced , not a drop of rain apart from a couple of late night showers.Edited: 4:42 pm, April 01, 2020 "
I have been travelling to Cuba lately in November and weather is usually not bad. I would say more chance of rain in first 2 weeks compared to last 2 weeks. Temperature is 25-30 C during the day with 2-3 degrees higher on the south coast.
Might be a lot of us looking at November....should be interesting.
We have been in October and weather has been great .
"HolaThe best time of the year to travel to cuba is april, last two weeks, or earlier in May...it is the change of season.Oct. Nov. and Dec...are a hit and miss. The last few years, Dec was great, but also can be very cool at night.I have been at CSM in Oct. and could not even go into the ocean, because of the large waves...beach was a mess...then again have been the same month the following year with perfect weather...you see where I am going with this....lolWhat was last year, was last year...cheers."
"Hey gato.., it was really nice weather the year I met you guys down there, couldn't complain about that at all.Actually the only real bad weather I've experienced there in Oct/Nov. was back in 2012, when Hurricane Sandy blew through..,two days of really nasty weather , then it slowly started to get better but my trip was up , so time to come home. Made it home , checked the weather and here comes Sandy barreling up the coast headed right at us. Luckily for us it took a hard left and missed us , but it did major damage to the East Coast of the US. No way should you have to live through the same Hurricane twice !Edited: 6:00 pm, April 01, 2020 "

"We have done the Atlantic side a few times in December with mixed results, a couple of times we had bad weather, at St Lucia it rained hard every single day for almost all daylight hours and Cayo Coco the wind was so bad it was cool! Both times I tried to get a refund but they only offered me a voucher, waaaaaa!"
Hey Nova yes the year we met you in Varadero weather was great like the other years we have been in October and the best part for us resorts are more then half empty We have been in April May August and September and April was the month I enjoyed the less .August is way to hot for me now probably because I'm to old for that kind of heat .May June September and October always had nice weather .
"I can only imagine how hot it would be in August gat0.., thinking way too hot for me too. I really like the mid Oct/Nov weather. Late March to mid April is always good too. Actually I should be there right now, was booked for March 21st to April 11th.., but that will have to wait for another time.Edited: 8:28 pm, April 01, 2020 "
Travel now. Then on return self isolate.
For sale. One pair slightly used wings. 390 lbs mgw. Serious inquires only
"Someone mentioned hurricanes above. There is some chance you might be impacted by one but you would have lots of chance to cancel your trip ahead of time.""Hurricane season officially runs from 1 June to 30 November, but the chances of a tropical storm impacting on your holiday are highly unlikely in June or July. In reality, hurricanes are only a realistic danger between mid August and early October."""
"We usually head down south twice a year. For a week in February to escape the cold, and two weeks in July.I actually prefer the summer trips. The resorts are not as crowded, prices are lower (same price for 2 weeks in the summer as it is for one week in the winter), and the heat and humidity do not bother me. I also find the summer, being hotter reduces the number of bug bites I take home as souvenirs."
"I usually go second week of March the weather is beautiful (although my wife had to wear a small jacket to keep the chill off for a couple nights) . The beaches were not calm ,it’s too rough to really enjoy ,there were a lot of people still in the water ."
"All our trips in March and April have been hot and little rain. We have also taken 2 trips in January. One rained almost the entire week (24/7) and the other, which was this year was pretty nice. Mid to high 20C, but the wind left the ocean hard to manage most days. Was still great and in hindsite so glad we went as our spring trip is a no go!"
"90% of our Cuban vacations have been in April with very good results.Also Dec. Jan. Feb. and March. Dec. in Las Tunas worked out good. Jan in Varadero, not so much but did different things. Holguin in Feb. ✔️.Cayo Largo any time is greatCayo Santa Maria and Cayo Coco/Guillermo are better later, although Guillermo in January had 26c and above.Good luck!"
Right now. I'm going tomorrow morning. Have the resort to myself.
Oh that’s nice! my I ask what resort
Los Basemento.
I wonder if it's AI...lol
"We have had good luck with the last two weeks of November. Specifically Nov 2019 was the best 2 weeks in Cayo Santa Maria we had in the last 12 Visits . January sucks! Don't do it!!!!!!!! Took us 3 Jan visits to figure that out........We will probably redo April's visit (we should be there ending our 1st week now......;-) in Nov 2020.Melia CSM here we come....if allowed by Nov.Edited: 8:33 pm, April 10, 2020 "
