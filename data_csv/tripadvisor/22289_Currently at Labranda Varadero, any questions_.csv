"I’m here until Sunday, March 22, unless drastic things arise. If there’s anything on which I can report, I’ll try. The weather for the past week has been outstanding, the food is good, my seaview room is spectacular, it’s a fabulous vacation for a fabulous price. Kaki"
Stay safe! Enjoy yourself! Get home safe!
"Don’t be in a rush to get home, the prairies just got dumped on again. The gang at EE Burritos will be waiting patiently for your new Salsa Moves!"
Thanks Vicki_Gordon!! This is all on my to do list!
You'll have to say hi to Geidys (Haydees) the guest relations lady. From her fans at Trip Advisor. Are you in the main building?
"Spunky, we are in the main building. It’s so convenient and walking out of my room to a view of the lobby is splendid. I’ll pass on your greeting!"
"If you're up on the 4th or 5th floor, hows the AC and is the cigar bar open?"
"Hola KakiIf your workplace decides you will have to self quarantine for 14 days, you might not be going back to work on Monday as planned....Enjoy your vacation. Everyone else wishing to go is envious.Cheers"
A Cubata? Now your talkin!Salúd!
"I’m on the 5th floor and the AC is pretty good. I don’t get the chance to try it out very often since I’m bunking with my elderly mom who has thin skin and complains when I turn it on. I put it on for 10 minutes and stand in front of the vent. There are cigars for sale all over but I don’t know about the bar. I was going to look into them as a gift to take home so I may find out about it yet.Edited: 1:31 am, March 16, 2020 "
"rrrichar, I’ve been keeping up with work emails and see what the plans are and how they are preparing, including working from home. I think this country is still considered rather safe so I don’t know if quarantine is a given, but then I here about international travel requiring it almost exclusively. I’ll still have to report on day 1 and see what they say. Our timing was quite ideal for getting away without feeling like we were being cavalier or going against good advice. I’m really grateful to have been able to come—a really much needed vacation—and hope it all works out in the end."
The cigar bar is the exclusive room behind the Cohiba bar.
What is the guest capacity like? Is the hotel half empty? Does it seems like they have less staff and affecting service at all?
"Get out now while you can. Take that last drink and coffee and find a flight out. You have no insurance and if you don’t have extra medication, it is now all on you. Things are dramatically changing for the worse, minute by minute. The federal government now has said that you will now not be repatriated by the government."
"There has been no statement with respect to repatriation. The government has banned travel entry of non-residents into Canada ......Americans exempt......so no need to panic. Enjoy the rest of your holiday.....at least you’re there, unlike the rest of us trying to decide, should we go?"
"Marlene H, I wouldn’t mind knowing what you know. If there isn't a flight out, what do I do? There’s no point being stranded in Toronto or Calgary when I have a direct flight home already booked. There are more cases if the virus there than where I am which is currently recording 4 cases, distant from me, with 258 people in quarantine for symptoms though they’ve tested negative. What do you mean I don’t have insurance? I absolutely do. I trust it won’t be cancelled in the face of necessity. I heard Trudeau’s address this morning. Please give me facts and links if you have them. Thanks."
Hi! I'm due to leave the UK for Cuba on Sunday and wondered what screening measures you underwent when entering the country? I really want to travel but am nervous xx
@kaki .. all south flights are cancelled ... talk to your rep about the plans to bring you home .. ( it may be early ) .. Sunwing stated they will get everyone home .
As of today all destinations from the south are still able to land at their original airport. So far only Sunwing has cancelled flights to the south. If your flight does get changed you better take it and get home. Once home you will be asked to go into self isolation for 14 days. Many things are closed here now. The big change is you will be checked out before you board the plane in Cuba and if you have any symptoms of the virus you will not be allowed to board the plane.
If you left after March 13 you have no health insurance in Cuba because Canada said not to go but you went anyway. If you left before March 13 you are covered.WestJet just cancelled all international flights but will try to get people home. Sunwing cancelled all flights from our area but will try to get people home. Talk to your Rep and ask them if your flight is leaving and what your options are.
"Of course I’m staying on top of everything. We came here on the 8th, before the “don’t travel” dictate. I am in touch with the rep here and my travel agent at home. I am registered with travel.gc.ca. I understand that Sunwing is not bringing more people down but is still returning us home, starting with the trouble areas of which Cuba is not one. I am paying for the internet for the updates. If anybody has any new news, I don’t mind hearing it but please provide a link. Friends and family are telling me all kinds of inflamed things but with no supporting links so I can’t verify or act on it. Thanks. Kaki"
"Well, I don't think you have given ANY consideration to the transit part. You know, other tourists from say, Europe who you may have crossed paths and just so happened to have droplets of their sunspray reach you or the touchscreens at the airport, the germs on the seat, the lack of social distancing when you are in the airport queue, etc. You really do NEED to self quarantene for 14 days regardless of ""well Cuba has a low rate of corona virus."" Now THAT is cavilere. To do so otherwise, is really putting others at risk. If you can work at home, do your part, and do it please. And the the poster who is leaving on Sunday? Really? Did I read correctly? SMH!"
They have 159 suspected in Cuba from what I;ve been told
"I agree with #25.....you as well as your mother must self-isolate for 14 days......Even if you have no symptoms. That’s how this thing was originally brought in, through travel. Cuba may not have the number of cases as does Canada, but you will passing through areas of contamination guaranteed."
"I would take the first available flight unless you don’t mind taking the chance of being stranded there for some time. The Canadian government is asking its citizens to do so as commercial flights might cease completely (they are already very reduced). The situation continues to evolve every day and we don’t know what will be the next measures. Some countries are now in complete lockdown.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/coronavirus-o…Edited: 11:35 am, March 17, 2020 "
"An example of a complete lockdown and how things can change quickly is Peru...they weren’t doing anything until March 13 where they started banning flights from four countries. Now They’ve ordered the closure of pretty much everything since midnight and banned all domestic and international flights, closed roads, including access to the capital and imposed a mandatory quarantine with people allowed out only for food and essential things. Police and military personnel are everywhere. So Cuba might not be doing anything at this time and is still inviting tourists but that could change quickly."
"Mike, which expert said this? ""Watching the news as we type. The recommendation from the health experts is to self moderate and then self isolate if showing any symptoms.""This seems to go against what I think is the latest recommendations. When you fly into a Canadian airport and you go to the machines they make you agree to self-isolate for 14 days before you can get processed. As far as I know, you may still be contagious without any symptoms so self-monitoring until you are symptomatic makes no sense."
"No, I think the direction being given to travellers returning to Canada is that you must self-isolate for 14 days, symptoms or not. At this point, anyone can be a carrier......"
"It’s a real sore point for me as I have a friend who just returned from Florida yesterday via Pearson Airport and she is not self-isolating.....carrying on as usual and wants to come up to our community for a visit. There’s a prime example of complete irresponsibility . We are in a state of emergency. This thing is already out of hand, and if most people are ignoring the direction as my friend is doing, then a lot of people here are going to start dying, plain and simple. Our first death from Covid-19 reported in Barrie this morning.Edited: 12:28 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"It’s nit a matter of believing everyone has covid. It is just nit possible to know who is a carrier and people ignoring advice keep spreading the disease more and more which leads governments to adopt more and more stringent measures that end up having social effects (everything closes) and a both and individual and a huge global economic effect.Edited: 12:55 pm, March 17, 2020 "
Why do you think I have so much time on my hands atm? :)
"So....Kaki....you are in Cuba now. From what I know, lots of time is being spent on the internet doing your research on what is going on back home, spending time with reps at the resort, and probably lots and lots of talk with others who are there with you now...what a lovely vacation! Seems stress free and fun to me."
I also have no problem in what the op is doing. At my work I am accustomed to rapid changes so for me it would not be too hard to just wait till the rep advised if there were any. Still nothing wrong with keeping abreast of any new developments.
The OP can do whatever she wants. I never said the contrary. She has all the information to make an informed decision.
"First off...my name is spelled...Vicki. Second, my comment WAS based on her original post at what a fantastic time she was having! Some posters here, and on other threads are still trying to decide on whether or not to still go. Each to their own...go...don’t go. It simply can’t be as wonderful being away from home when the entire world is going through this crisis. You are all 100% correct though. People can do what they want, and they should. But if those people are bringing back this lovely gift of a virus and putting unnecessary stress on our government to get them back, I have just as much right to voice my opinion...even if it is sarcastic in tone. I wish everyone currently struggling to find a flight back home much success in getting one. I hope they also come home virus free. We all know how beautiful and sunny Cuba is right now...many of us had to cancel and miss out! We just don’t want ANYONE who still might be contemplating going (unless it’s their home, or need to get to their families), any reason to hop on a plane right now to have wonder food, beach time, and lovely weather. That was ONLY my point for what is worth to the critics out there. Enough said!Edited: 4:21 pm, March 17, 2020 "
Mike...just hoping that people are not going to be encouraged (not implying at all that Kaki is doing that) to go right now. We are all aware that there are still a few loopholes in travelling south right now and some airlines are still bringing people in...unless I am completely wrong and not informed. There are still a dozen or so threads going where people are still ready to get on those planes...I for one do not want one single travellers who is currently away bringing in any more problems into our country and my neighborhood. Period!
"Thanks very much to those of you who are giving me credit for making the best decisions for myself, my mother and my aunt. :o) I don’t know how the others can be so critical of my actions assuming I’m blithely drinking on the beach tempting fate, not considering what I’ll face during the flight home. “Get the first flight out” is simpler than it sounds. I am sucking the life out of every free and relaxing moment I have here. When I do finally get home I am definitely going to be quarantined, as enforced by the government of Canada, my workplace, and my best judgment. There is a meeting tomorrow at 3:30 pm at which time all Canadians flying Sunwing will be advised as to their new flights. All Canadians, regardless of airline or tour group, are to be out of the country by the 23rd. In the meantime, I’m handwashing, sanitizing, keeping my distance from everybody except my mother and aunt, keeping my immunities in fighting form, trying to sleep lots, and everything else that anybody is doing anywhere to respect the virus and maintain sanity. I also know when I’m out of my league and since I don’t own a plane and can’t sit on hold for the estimated hundreds of minutes it will take to get through to an airline to try to get a flight off this island to any of the receiving airports in Canada, I’m doing what I can and trying to find peace in the whole thing. There was a question I’ll answer in another entry. Kaki"
"Sparky, the cigar bar is not open...right now. Apparently the girl who runs it did something to her knee (I think?) and is off for 10 days. It sounds like it is a going concern though, in general. There’s a sign about it in the elevator! Kaki"
"yevgeniya v, as you can imagine, some things have changed since you asked your question. As I was told today, this hotel is at about 85% capacity, but most of the other hotels in the ‘hood are at 30%. The Italians have already left, I think the Germans are up next, then France and Canada. Something like that anyway. By the beginning of next week it will only be the Russians left. I don’t think they really know what will be happening as of mid-next week yet, in respect of reduction of staff or much else. Service is generally pretty good, even up to today. Sometimes there are lapses but I think it’s based on individual worker as opposed to the running of the hotel. We’ve had an excellent maid for most of the last 10 days. Big smile, she knows what we like, ensures that we always get enough toilet paper and water, and provides fabric sculptures on the bed. I think on her days off we had a dud. No toilet paper, only bath towels and no hand towels, no bar of soap to replace the scrap we’d worn the old one down to. It was easily rectified with a query to the front desk, but as far as service, there was indeed the void. The staff are really quite lovely and truly you just need to ask if something was missed, but sourcing can be a problem and there’s often something not available that was here yesterday, like no mint for mojitos or no wine. That’s not really a service thing though and the staff is always apologetic. They must be starting to get antsy though. It’ll be tough once the people disappear completely. Kaki"
"Kayleigh P, there wasn’t anything by way of screening that I noticed upon arrival. I’d heard that the authorities were checking temperatures as travellers arrived, and I saw a picture of a device that was held in front of a person’s face that could read that, but nothing like that was done when we arrived. I wondered if they’d progressed to some modern technology that scans the room and has a flashing light where a feverish human being is standing. Again, a lot has happened since you posted your question yesterday, but I’m very curious to know if you will indeed be traveling this weekend. Please advise! Kaki"
my name is spelled BILL Johnny C
"Kaki.., you go girl ! You're doing everything right, you're there and making the best of it until you can get home under these very trying circumstances .I remember reading some of your posts on the DR forum a few years back, you were always so environmentally , and culturally friendly even way back then. I know you are doing the best you can for you , your mother and your aunt. Best wishes for the last few days of your stay , and I hope all the best for you and yours on your way home,esp. and when you arrive there.., good health you and to us all.Edited: 2:19 am, March 18, 2020 "
"Kaki...I remember you well helping us when going to Dreams La Romana a few years back, we had a great time...thanks for that and for this :) Sounds like you're having a relaxing holiday considering all that is happening right now...I do hope things end well and you're all home safe soon :)"
Quarantine is required as directed by Government of Canada. 14 days self isolation (don't leave your house) upon return from any international travel. Pay for a grocery service or have friends drop off groceries outside your door.
They should make you stay in cuba. Selfish ppl.
"Hi Luckyme! It’s great to hear from you. It’s a strange thing to be here enjoying square and varied meals with little work, looking around at the exact scenery that we choose to pay thousands of dollars to visit, while at the same time there is definitely anxiety in the face of the world’s events. We’ve been assigned an earlier flight and I also received an email saying that if you’re stranded here by another airline, you can try to fly standby on one of the Sunwing flights. I’m with two loved ones in their 80s so playing parent in diligently watching for any symptoms. Good health to all! I’ll never wish bad things upon anyone. Kaki"
Thank you SWNova!! I very much appreciate your good wishes and return them to you threefold!Kaki
"Hi Kaki., You're welcome, and thanks !Yes Sunwing has said that if anyone is in need of hitching a ride home and they have room on the plane, just hop right on..,and no charge !"
Your fine post/thread has us wanting to know all went well on your departure/arrival home...please come back and let us know...I sound like a DE right now :) Might as well do some more fine reporting while you're waiting :)
"That's where we were GOING to go next month. Poop. Should have gone in March, when Mr. Des wanted to go. Alas, hindsight etc."
"""The world as we know it.....""..... We booked time off at the end of November to go to Varadero. Will it happen? I really hope so - that would mean that all this ""world war III"" is well over and we are back to business as usual. Cuba will need tourists to rebuild one of their most important industries. I am willing to help :) I just hope we will be given a chance. And I am with Kaki - enjoy it while you still can - I think your return flight will be there to get you guys out of there in time.... Yes, let us know how it went...."
Sure hope they stay on top of maintaining the resorts while they are all closed down .Could be a real mess if they let nature take over . and it wouldn't take long . Johnny C
Good time to spruce them up a bit if possible. Workers could self isolate at the resort and maybe get something done.
"Thank you so much for the interest! I am now back in Saskatoon. I checked out last night at 11 pm and boarded the transfer to the airport. The Sunwing rep gave us the wrong time, telling us the pick up was at 11:15 when it was actually 11. It wasn’t a big problem for us but the guide was a bit frustrated and knew that the rep had been off on what he told us so it appears to be a trend. We were in the lobby 15 minutes early but could’ve been there 10 minutes before that. At three of the subsequent stops, people didn’t board the large van. It may’ve been due to a change of plan, getting a taxi or even missing the pick up time. I heard that ours was the last Sunwing flight out of Cuba. Our flight left Varadero at 3:05 am and took 6 hours to get to Edmonton. I then had a flight to Calgary and then to Saskatoon. We landed in Saskatoon at 1:30 pm local time today. My mother has mobility issues and uses a wheelchair in the airport which is not a service to be relied upon at the Varadero airport. My aunt had left before us and wasn’t able to secure one at all, and I ended up having to push both our full luggage cart and my mom’s chair once we arrived. Sunwing did a pretty fantastic job for us. To limit contact, right at the start of the flight they gave out individual bottles of water to each passenger and a little boxed snack of cheese spread and good crackers, salami, chocolate, cookies, and almonds instead of selling meals on board. They came around again at the 4.5 hour point with another tray of snacks: cashews and KitKats and Twizzlers and hummus and great little Tapas packs, another great package of meat and cheese and olives and salsa and bagel bites. It was a really empty flight, only 61 of us on board, so we each had our own row. All's well that ends well, but I certainly hope nobody gets sick or carried the virus back home. Thanks again for coming along in the ride with me. I’m still happy to try to answer questions if I g hv Ave them, sorry I wasn’t able to get the snail address that was requested. Kaki"
Welcome home. So glad you made it. Guess that was one holiday you won't soon forget.
Jeezus.
"Thanks for letting us know Kaki...glad you and Mom are home safe :) I assume you've been to Cuba before...that would've been a heck of a first visit not to mention the journey home :) I guess you were told to self isolate like the 1000's returning from March break...gonna be very interesting this next few weeks. This is a lot more exciting/busy than the La Romana/Bayahibe forum, you might as well stick around for a while :) A lot of virus talk lately of course, with some history and embargo talk as well. Oh, and quite a bit of bashing going on...the airlines/refunds/vouchers/politics and Trump of course :)"
All is well that ends well - happy that you guys made it home ok :)
"Welcome home Kaki, Enjoy your Self Isolation,.and Crank those Cuban Tunes!"
"Luckyme, it was actually my first time to the country! But there’s nothing about a horrific virus that has the world in its clutches that would make me hold any negative part of this trip against beautiful and innocent Cuba. I was there now to visit a friend and I will definitely return at some point. I had really wanted to go to Havana but the self-isolating, especially with the oldsters, started while on the island and we kept pretty close to the resort. That in itself requires a return. I shot videos and recorded 30 minute audio pieces of pounding surf but I didn’t find music to buy so I’m checking out YouTube and iTunes for my fix. I like to see what I can buy of unsigned local favourites so I’m sorry to have missed out on that. Is there a thread somewhere talking about how good looking the Cuban people are? Wow!Kaki"
Cuba is indeed beautiful and mostly innocent Kaki :) I'm assuming you didn't get scammed or the short end of a money exchange :) Ya those Cuban's are looking pretty good...they take a lot of pride in that. They all have beautiful teeth and hair...must be all the toothpaste and shampoo we keep leaving them :)
Kaki:Really pleased that you and your mother are safely back home. Quite a journey you had.
"The food is simple and annoying. No good service. No Cola, no vine, no sparkling water. Everyday something is out. Now no tennis balls. On Saturday it seems we had a Corona problem. Everyone started wearing masks after an ambulance picked up people from a room at bravo club. Seaview and weather are good."
WOW with all that is going on you are still in Cuba.
""" On Saturday it seems we had a Corona problem ""How out of touch with reality are you ?"
>>> Now no tennis balls<<<Plus the other comments. Are you for real???
Some people it is mememe.Gawd sake turn the news on and get real.
Lets not let a troll ruin a fine thread :)
I am two rooms away from the person's which have been taken away with ambulance. I am still in Labranda. I am in reality.
telling the truth is ruining your thread?
I am afraid you are not.If you were the things you posted would not have even been thought about let alone written on a forum.For christ sake people are dying and you complain not tennis balls.Get a grip.
Why are you still there? What arrangements do you have for returning home?
Nobody is allowed to leave the hotels and casas. Only way is to go to airport. Cuba locked down. All hotels shut down for Corona until Friday. That are the news and reality.
I wrote that for the advertising message of a dream hotel. The food is not bad for Corona. It was before. I could ask why anybody is writing advertising stories about a hotel during people are dying.It was only a correction.
"Thé hotels are shut down for longer then until Friday... I guess your plane leaves Friday?And yes, why are you still in Cuba? It blew my mind when I heard last night that more then 9000 tourists were still in Cuba."
"Back peddle a bit more.What you wrote is disgusting in this time.You really need to get real and shake yourself .That is to post 88Edited: 9:49 am, March 24, 2020 "

cigar bar was open today and the AC is running in 4th floor. But hotel will close this week
Our plane leaves today before midnight. The hotel is almost empty
No tennis balls. People literally dying in the streets in some countries. Death toll rising by the minute.You have no tennis balls. The staff must really love this guy.
About time you got out of that country goofy . 14 days self isolation when you get home . Or are you going to ignore that too ??Johnny C
Actually the guy was from Switzerland so English is probably his 3rd language.... and the tennis ball / food comments etc could just be his mental diversion technique to compensate for the stress he is under in Cuba....Doesn't make it not stupid comments.... but at times like this not everything is what it seems.
No that is not mental diversion. It is a stupid comment just like saying about the cigar bar open.What does he not understand ? The country and the world is on lockdown .I hope for the plane crew are going to be safe bringing him home.
"Makes sense to me Gordon, I've been saying a lot of stupid things lately :)He won't be a problem on the flight as long as he's just carrying his luggage and some stupid questions/comments :) According to his post, he could be carrying you know what...I hope he gets tested for a few things.Edited: 5:15 am, March 25, 2020 "
At home is no Quarantine or self-Isolation. My comment for the cigar bar or AC has been an answer to a question. What is your problem?
And you are still out?Get yourself in self isolation.Do you not understand?
KDM1703: Where are you now? If you are back home you should be self isolating for 14 days. If not you are an idiot.
Without comment: https:/…
Exactly. Shows mentality of some.
