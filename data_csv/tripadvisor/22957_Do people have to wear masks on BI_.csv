I see the coronavirus infection rate is extremely low on the Big Island. I want to go on a fun vacation in a few months but the last thing I want to do is wear a mask and have a ridiculous mask tan line on my face! I am tired of wearing masks here in Texas and just want to enjoy my vacation. Is it mandatory in Hawaii like everywhere else? Even if I have a respiratory issue?
"No one can say what the situation may be ""in a few months.""But I suspect this post is just trolling the forum."
This is the same dude who posted previously asking about how best to violate quarantine while he visits his friend in Puna.
"Try using brain, you should wear a mask inside buildings and outside only when you can't social distance. Sunbathing and swimming is when you get your tan, no masks needed. You just sound like a 'no-masker' period, so stay home."
"“I see the infection rate is low but I don’t want to wear a mask.”GEE YOU DON’T THINK MAYBE THE TWO THINGS ARE CORRELATED?I really hope you’re a trill, otherwise you just sound dumb if that’s what you think in real life."
"Yes, hopefully Troll. Perhaps correlated is wayyyy too big a word. Someone who actually does have 'respiratory issue' cannot risk getting Covid at all. No way they would want to fly and not wear a mask. They catch it, they die.."
I keep telling people....the crazies and cranky people come out every full moon :-0!
"I got it. Texas Republican Governor FINALLY made masks mandatory. This guy can't deal with it, so wants to find a utopian No Masker haven... I say he goes to the moon, with no mask.https://www.mysanantonio.com/coronavirus/art…"
