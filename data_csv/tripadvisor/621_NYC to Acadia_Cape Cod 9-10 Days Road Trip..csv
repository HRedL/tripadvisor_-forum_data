"I was wondering if anyone help me out with an itinerary for 9-10 days for the end of August for a group of 4 active adults. We live in NY, so we are good with respect to COVID19 restrictions. Any advice is appreciated. We would like to be Acadia/ Bar Harbor for at least three nights and Cape Cod for 3 nights as well. We enjoy good beaches, good nightlife and we are an adventurous group.Day 1: Drive to Portland from New YorkDay 2: AcadiaDay 3: AcadiaDay 4: AcadiaDay 5: ??Day 6: Cape CodDay 7: Cape CodDay 8: Cape Cod/ Martha's VYDay 9: ?Day 10: Head back to NYC"
"""we are good with respect to COVID19 restrictions.""""good nightlife""Those two don't jive. I don't think you'll find what most people call good nightlife under the restrictions.Your outline looks fine. Sorry can't think of much to say as travel and stay times speak for themselves. Traffic isn't the factor it usually is but you have some long drives so I would still try to travel at times with lower traffic.Heading South from Acadia, for example, on a Sunday afternoon would be something to avoid. As would approaching the Cape on Saturday.Edited: 9:06 am, August 04, 2020 "
Hi Hank - you are totally right. Sorry about that night life part. For day 5 is there a town you recommend staying?
Be careful in Maine with regards to COVID restrictions. I have heard they are pretty strict about proof of negative test and so on. I do not know all the details but it is worth investigating.
Portsmouth NH or Newburyport MA would be good choices if you want to stay reasonably close to half way (depending how far out on the Cape you are going) between Acadia and the Cape.
"....and as for day 9. I think after three days on the Cape you will either have come up with something you want to see again or something you want to see but haven't got to yet. Although Newport RI would be an option if you want to get off the Cape sorta on the way home. Or Mystic CT is you want to get a bit further on you way to NYC.Edited: 9:44 am, August 04, 2020 "
"Since you said beaches, you could stop at the southern ME beaches like York, Ogunquit and Old Orchard."
"Per current Maine guidelines, you will need negative COVID-19 test results within 72 hours of your visit to Maine."
"#7 - they are traveling from New York and are not subject to Maine's testing requirements. NY, NJ and the other New England States (with the exception of MA and RI) are exempted."
I would keep an eye open for changes between now and then but #8 is definitely correct as of now. You might want to pay particular attention to cancellation policies though. Things can change.
"What a fun trip!! Here is my recNYC to Cape Cod with two stops:Abbots in the Rough in NoankCoffee at Daves or Bolt in Providence or amazing tea at Ceremony PVDCape Cod - I recommend Wellfleet or Chatham or East DennisCape Cod to Portland Stop at Bite into Maine https://www.biteintomaine.com/locationsCoffee at Tandem on Congress and lobster at EventidePortland to Acadia with a lunch stop at Karen's in BoothbayAcadia (we are staying in Surrey/Blue Hills and recommend the same as it can be very crowded in Bar HarborBar Harbor to Portsmouth NH (it can be crowded but a lovely pit stop/overnight) or Newburyport/Plum IslandHomeIf you need eats detes, let me know. P.S. a stop in New Bedford en route from NYC to CC would be cool if you LOVE Bubble TeaPM me anytime"
Watch the COVID restrictions. Rhode Island is now a state whose residents cannot freely travel to Mass.
We are debating staying in Acadia for 4 nights now. Would you guys prefer 2 night in Cape Cod or Kennebunk? We are looking to stay in Portland on Day 6 but we can move things around if it fits best in our itinerary. We are looking to spend the last 2 nights in a nice beach town (max 4.5 hours away from NYC) and head back home on Day 9. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
"Personally, I think you are doing too much...Why not focus on Maine and NH vs trying to traverse to the Cape?"
Any town you could suggest for 2/3 nights less than 5 hours away from NYC?
"May be slightly more than 5 hours, but Rockport, MA is beautiful!"
"I recommend you drive NYC to Portland with a stop in Worcester for coffee at A&E Coffee Roaster. Food available. Continue on and consider your first overnight in Portsmouth. Great little town, GREAT food and Kittery right over the border for lobster at Bob's. Day 2, continue on to Portland for 1-2 nights. Consider visiting one of the islands such as Peaks or Chebeague. Bring a bike over. Continue on for your trip to Acadia. Stop at Reds for lobster in Wicassett, it's worth the wait. Get their before their opening to get in line or go 2-3 PM. Near Acadia, you can stay on the Blue Hill Peninsula or wherever you wish. 4 days/3-4 nights, your choice. Don't miss Deer Isle area. I have food and coffee recs if need be. Also, I have great lobster recs. Return trip, the rec for Rockport is sound or Newburyport and Plum Island. Or, what about Mystic CT? Cape Cod is best saved for another tripEdited: 6:36 am, August 12, 2020 "
