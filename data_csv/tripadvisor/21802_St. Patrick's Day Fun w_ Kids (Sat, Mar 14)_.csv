"We are arriving in town this weekend and hoping to catch some of the St. Patrick's Day celebrations with our kids. We have four adults, 4 kids aged 10, 10, 9, and 8.We'd love to see the green river and if possible catch some of the parade, but moreso just looking for fun, family-friendly activities that will be taking place for all of us to enjoy."

"Parades in Chicago mean lots of people and not a lot of bathrooms. And, it's often very cold on St Pat's parade day.St. Pats is the traditional day for suburban teenagers to go downtown and get drunk and vomit in public."
"Rick, you’ve posted this urban legend on another recent St. Pat’s question. You are wrong. You should come into the city and get a reality check. No establishment is going to put their hard won and expensive liquor license in jeopardy by serving underage teens. If teens from your suburb bring their own booze when they come into the city, the expanded police presence isn’t going to put up with that behavior. Porta-potties are as numerous along the parade route as in Grant Park for Taste of Chicago, The Chicago Jazz Fest or Lollapalooza. Right now accuweather is predicting about 40 degrees F. That’s a perfect temp for the last two weeks of winter. It’s still winter.The great thing, Rick, is that you don’t have to come into the city to enjoy St. Pat’s celebrations if you don’t want to. The festivities are 65 years old. They have survived in spite of your incorrect assessment. Don’t throw a wet rag on the rest of us celebrating.Edited: 5:46 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"The Mayor is coming back from vacation. I'd be surprised if she didn't cancel the parade, so keep up with the news, I guess."
Governor wants it canceled. Announcement tomorrow.
No announcement necessary. Lightfoot isn’t going toe to toe against Pritzker over a parade.
"Btw, Ogden school is infected, right in the middle of the Gold Coast. If I know this info, hopefully Lori knows."
Sounds like it will for sure be canceled tomorrow.
I would Reschedule your trip if possible. I would be surprised if the parade goes on. As others have said time to lay low for a while.
"I wouldn't cancel a domestic trip per se, but I would not go to parades or stadiums and use other cautions that you would at home like using sanitizer, don't shake hands, etc."
The parade is cancelled = https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…
Virus hit downtown = https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…
"In case you don't want to bother with the link, or cannot access the Tribune website, Chicago has cancelled (or ""postponed"" as Mayor Lightfoot said) Saturday’s downtown parade *and* dyeing of the Chicago River, Sunday’s South Side Irish Parade, and Sunday's NorthWest Irish Parade (in the Norwood Park neighborhood)."
"Chicago cancelled everything and I had tour tickets for Chicago underground which I hope I will get another chance to use, but not sure how to contact Trip Advisor/Viator to question for ""rain delay"" or coronavirus delay..... I do not need a refund, just want to actually use the tour for 2 that I already purchased at some later date when allowed."
