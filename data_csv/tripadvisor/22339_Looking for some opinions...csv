Hi all. My 70 year old mother who goes to ACA every year since 67 is currently there since Jan. She is staying in a condo complex on the beach which is very underutilized and hardly any people in the units. She is due to fly back to Chi april 5. With all that is going on do you feel as if she is better off staying till april or coming home sooner? She says its quiet there now and I feel as if she is better off in a less populated area which has great weather and people than to fly home early to Chicago which isn't bad but who knows what will happen...any thought would be greatly appreciated...Have a great day and stay safe!!
"Considering she would be going through at least two airports, and airports being the main vectors in this situation, she should just stay put if she can afford it. That being said, this may take weeks or months before we're able to see the light at the end of the tunnel, so if she doesn't have any pressing issues, she may be better off self-isolating in a milder climate for the time being.Edited: 5:47 pm, March 16, 2020 "
If her health is good and she wants to stay then she should enjoy the City by the Bay.Returning to the US at this time just exposes her to the hysteria that we are currently experiencing.
"Miguel makes a good point regarding airports. She will have to go through either Mexico City or Houston on her way to Chicago O’Hare. If you are following your local news, then you are aware of the issues with the huge crowds in the international terminal. Virus doesn’t appear to be in Acapulco. IMO she should stay put."
Thank you all for your help. I feel the same way but it feels good to hear it from you all..thank you!!
"It’s only going to get worse. We will be like Italy in a few weeks. So if she can’t stay permanently, she should come home now and self quarantine in my opinion."
"Tough question ... and tough decision.Personally, I'd try to get home. To the extent possible, she should consider some degree of isolation — there or here. ACA may be smaller than CHI, but there are still 100s of thousands of people. FYI - the virus is already in Acapulco (confirmed, according to one news report)."
"I'd stay put in ACA, considering the choices. Too risky for travel through the airports now. And in all seriousness, she may be going nowhere on the 5th anyway, if the airlines stop flying into the U.S."
"I am not going to opine on staying or going. If she decides to shelter in place, Amazon.com.mx might be useful to get supplies, but I would do that sooner than later. As of late last week, they still had essentials. There has been people to exposed to the virus tested in Acapulco. It is only a matter of time until it has spread there, Semana Santa at the latest. I would consider taking all the recommended steps - putting away some supplies, better and more consistent handwashing, etc, as of now."
"Walmart also delivers. And up until now, Thursday deliveries have been free with a $250 pesos purchase. I have been having the heavy stuff delivered mostly (canned items and yes, that includes beverages)."
New news on Chicago O’Hare
"One more thing to consider is that her April flight might get cancelled, stranding her. A lot of flights are being cancelled.Edited: 7:13 pm, March 17, 2020 "
"We are currently in Acapulco and have sadly concluded that we must end our holiday three weeks early.The government of Canada is recommending immediate repatriation and some insurance companies are threatening to cancel medical insurance coverage. In addition, one of the Canadian airlines have announced they will stop flying to international destinations effective this coming Sunday and the other main airline may follow their lead.Prior to all this news, we had decided to stay put and weather the storm. We feel very safe in Acapulco and they are so few other people here, being in large groups is not a concern. I understand there is one presumed case here and that is will likely spread, but it is a beautiful place to be 'stranded'. Stores appear to have ample supplies and friends have offered to help out where necessary. However, when your home government proclaims it is best to get home and insurance companies threaten cancellation, and there are health issues related to high-risk persons, you must consider personal safety first.For the OP, I would not be concerned about your mother staying in Acapulco assuming her health is good. The main concern I would have is with the airlines closing down flights home. Who knows how long that may last?Good luck with your decision. It was very difficult to make our decision to return home early."
"Sorry to hear that, PolarBear. I hope that you have a safe and fast journey home."
"I think you made the right decision, Bear. Next year's another year."
"Not to be alarmist about it, but it looks like life is beginning to change quickly down there (as it has here at home). Baby'O closing up, churches closing up, banks limiting the number of people allowed in, and beaches half empty ... according to the latest reports. Hoping that the city and its people aren't too hard hit — healthwise.https:/…https:/…https://www.elsoldeacapulco.com.mx/local/pid…https://www.milenio.com/estados/bar-baby-aca…"
"Yep, lines at the banks yesterday along the Costera were out the doors and down the sidewalks. 10 people (is what I heard) allowed in at any given time. SAT (the IRS here) closed their offices to walk ins. All appointments must be made online, and only ONE ISSUE at a time, if you need to do 2 things, you need 2 appointments. U.S. Embassy announced no more Visas would be given out until further notice.Edited: 10:41 am, March 18, 2020 "
I am supposed to head down there on the 25th do you recommend cancelling?
Same here I'm coming the 21st. What do you guys think? No elderly or health averse in my group. Really dont want to cancel but if everything is going to be closed up..
Acapulco now has two confirmed cases. May not seem like a lot but how many more are out there. I think you need to make that decision on your own. How do you feel about flying in a Petri dish?
US Embassy? Acapulco?
"Go or don't go is a personal decision. I wouldn't. Age, health, and what'll be open or closed has no bearing on whether you might pick up the virus while you're there ... or worse yet, unknowingly bring it with you to ACA. If you do go, I'd make sure to have sufficient funds available (cash or credit access) in the event you need medical care. Doubtful (I'd think) that travel insurance would cover you at this point in time.Others may think differently, but that's my take. Sorry to say it, but Mexico really didn't do anything to get ahead of the curve ... and regretably, I think it's gonna spread more quickly than one might expect."
Puerto Vallarta has closed all bars and nightclubs. I think it is only a matter of time before it trickles down to all the beach destinations.
"Lagotex, yes, the U.S. Embassy (here in Acapulo) as well as Mexico City, and everywhere else in Mexico. Closed. No more visas issued until further notice. As for the new folks flying down here, I'm guessing your flights are going to be cancelled."
Stay safe all hopefully it does not effect too many down there. We also did not get quite enough ahead of the curve with this.The next 6 to 8 weeks will seem like an eternity. I am fortunate to be working as I know so many who are not.
"Oh such a toss up! I just returned from Acapulco!And with all that's going on here now, I wish I was back there! This is chaos!On the other hand, if I have to be out of work and basically stay home, I'd rather be home!If your worried about her, I'd get her home!I'm jealous that she gets to stay so long! Lucky lady!Good luck to you and your family, stay safe!"
"I'll throw my 2 cents in on this. I gad a pretty wild last couple of weeks returning from Eastern Europe as this started to unfold and the ban was announced, then getting. In the past 2 weeks I have been in the airports of Moscow, Kiev, Prague, Paris, New York (which was the absolute worst), Boston, Atlanta, Mexico City, and Acapulco where I am now. I will say that by far the American airports were the least prepared, the most dirty, and the workers weren't even wearing masks/gloves. The food in the lounges was open to everyone, hands everywhere, it was disgusting (except Boston was clean), customs was an absolute NIGHTMARE at JFK, 4 agents servicing about 500 people with no crowd control, people were pushing, fighting, I had my face covered, gloves on, just hoping the entire time I didnt get that sh*t, and feeling very disappointed that this was actually happening. Personally, I'd rather be here than in L.A, where I would normally go. I have an extremely low chance of dying from this virus which there is no cure for anyways. So I'll take my chances quarantining at the beach. And if I overstay my visa, whatever, you can always get a new one at immigration for like $25 and just say you lost it.... I've done that several times.... The Visa is the last thing to worry about. If it was my Mom, who is 71, I would keep her here if financially possible. She will likely do the same thing here as back home, and getting there opens up more potential to getting it than staying put, in my opinion, especially with potential delays. Especially if she has a way to get groceries. I stocked up from the Soriana Super by Brooklyns, it was super clean, everyone had masks on, and when I was there, there was about 4 other people in the entire store. There was not the ""toilet paper chaos"" that I have seen in the states. From what I've heard/read, 2 people have Coronavirus in Guerrero, one in Acapulco, an Argentinian man who was in Italy, who is quarantined at the hospital, the other in Chilpancingo. I believe that slowly they are taking precautions here, about a month or so behind the states, but there's less cases. It is a tough call. But if it was my mom, I'd stock her up now, before it spreads, make sure she's set potentially for a couple months. Best of luck, man"
