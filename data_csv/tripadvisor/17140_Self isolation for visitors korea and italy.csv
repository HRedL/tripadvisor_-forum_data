It has just been announced by our government that If you have been in northern italy or south korea you are required to self isolate in nz for 14 days. Unfortunately if you are on holiday that is going to be a major cost and not a great holiday. https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/11…
"That could be bad news for us poppy. Not that we will need to self isolate but that it must greatly increase the chance that Korean Air will cancel their daily flight to ICN. We’re due to fly home via ICN on 18/3.But as my wife has just said, it’s a first world problem really."
Yes NZ has just recorded it's first case of the coronovirus so greater controls will be in force now.
"#1. i feel your pain. we due to go to northern italy this month. Airflights, accommodation, tours, attractions all paid for. we been planning for a year and our first holiday which is more than two weeks. Travel insurance wont pay for us to cancel now as govt hasnt officially advised extreme risk and not to travel to italy. In fact, nz govt happy for us to travel there, just not back to nz.Stuck in a country where you dont speak the language, isolated, etc is not a good position to be in. And then to come back and expect to self isolate - wont be a job left to come back to at that rate, And despite that more people die each day from mosquitos, murdered, snake bites, malnutrition. But they Not a WHO funded priority"
HI do you know if this applies to people who only transit through South Korea? We fly 12 March London to Auckland with 2 hour stop in Incheon. Flight refund only available if our government advice is against essential travel (which it isn't) or if NZ block entry! I think if we have to self isolate we would be covered by travel insurance if I could provide evidence (not just a newspaper article). The NZ immigration restrictions don't seem to mention this self isolation. Unless I am missing something. Can you help provide more info? Or a link to an official website mentioning this? Thank you! I am worried now!
In the article in original post it states “ People entering the country from South Korea and northern Italy will also be told to go into self-isolation when they arrive.”
"And this https://nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm…Edited: 2:36 am, March 02, 2020 "
"Sally - I think at this stage it’s not clear whether transit passengers through ICN will be affected, but I expect it will be clarified soon.We did the same transit through ICN 4 weeks ago (albeit from CDG with a 50 minute transit) and we had our temperatures checked even then."

"I just hope they enforce the ""isolation"" and dont just use an honour system.See new insurance policies exclude wu hu flu."
Just cancelled our flights with Korean Air who agreed to full refund due to quarantine. Now need to rebook. Not sure which route to choose though. Singapore? Or Dubai?
"I live in Milan, northern Italy,in One of the most health efficient country in Europe. I am not a zombie Who want to eat your brain and we live normal lives. Hálf of the so called positive cases do not have any syntom, number of people Who died were unfortunately same Number of people Who died last year because flu did the ""final touch"" on pre-existing pathologies like cancer, but last year the world did not count them. Anyway, I will cancel my honeymoon in end of April dreamed fór a lifetime and hope that Emirates Will refund the flights (considering that technically NZ did not close its custom to italians)"
"So sorry you are having to cancel your honeymoon Claudio, that is terrible. I fear for everyone involved in tourism, they will be hit harder than most with the worldwide coronavirus induced recession. We have to assume that the powers that be know what they are doing but must admit it does seem like we are fighting a losing battle with this one."

"We are now flying via Singapore with Lufthansa - hopefully!! Self isolating when you return to your own country is one thing, and potentially inconvenient, but self isolating for the first 2 weeks of a 3 week holiday to a foreign country would be completely awful. Thankfully Korean Air noted that we would be quarantined and agreed to full refund. As things stand, this could suddenly escalate rapidly absolutely anywhere, so we are prepared that our plans may have to change again - but we really hope not. We particularly are hoping that things don't change whilst we are enroute - that would be very bad.Here;'s hoping that we do get to NZ to see your wonderful country - and to see our son!"
I can't see how NZ can avoid an epidemic.https://i.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/119…
"Singapore is 2 legs of 12 hours. Dubia has 1 of 17 hours.Watch out for changes to travel advisories. LAX might be safest bet.#13 is political and not travel related and has been reported. Poppy, councilling is still available for those that dont understand democracy.Edited: 3:53 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"#17 understand it. Was just explaining our govt to claudia.Edited: 2:33 am, March 03, 2020 "
"""self-isolation"" what a load of hogswallop - our Govt. needs to grow a spine."
"The action being taken in NZ is consistent with other countries and will be based on advice from officials, not on political expediency.Have a look at Paris forum. Louvre is closed.Its all a PITA. We were planning for Chelsea Flower Show and a cruise flying with CZ or Korean. Didnt quite book. Feel like we dodged a bullet.Friend had extra 14 days on Diamond Princess, now followed by 14 days in motor home in detention."
As predicted Korean Air have cancelled their AKL-ICN service until 28/3.I’ve had an email from them saying that they have rebooked us on the SYD-ICN service on the same day but no mention of how we get to SYD to catch it! Luckily we have two weeks to sort this and I’ll call them as soon as we get off the East Cape (stunningly beautiful but no mobile signal!).
"Keep smiling John. Two weeks is a long while for things to change at the moment, and will the Sydney to Seoul flight still be running by then? You'll just have to stay on holiday for even longer!"
“ Have a look at Paris forum. Louvre is closed.”The Louvre is not closed by the government in an attempt to contain the virus. The Louvre is closed because the employees are on strike because they felt they had to work in unsafe conditions. All other major museums and attractions in Paris remain open for business.
Andy - We’re so traumatised we had to take to a bottle of Pinot Noir with the lamb loin for dinner tonight. The mobile cellar looks like it will need another replenishment in Gisborne.
It's a hard life!
"#21 good luck. i was reading on the air travel site that travellers with flights cancelled have been unable to get through to airlines and holding over 5 hours. Its certainly an evolving situation all the time. Our insurance now saying they wont cover coronavirus claims after 28 febdespite us taking out insurance out last year, cause its now considered a known event and we choose to still travel. but they wont accept claims to change or cancel as its our choice! ."
I read the fine details of my travel insurance taken out last July and it says no coverage for pandemics. They do cover for terrorism but not for war. However I am not flying until April 14 to Sydney (Emirates) then to Doha on April 18 and Bucharest on April 20 (Qatar). so just wait and see. I was talking with a friend yesterday who tells me her Travel Company has cancelled her tour in China next month and all money returned.
"#27 our insurance does cover panda ics and epidemics. they getting out of claims by saying it is an existing event, and government intervention."
"There are lots of reports of people struggling to get through to speak with anyone at Korean Air. When I called them yesterday it wasn't too bad. I was only on hold for about 30 minutes, and was then connected to a very helpful operator who cancelled our flights and agreed to a full refund. From what I hear, they are happy to do this where changes/cancellations to their schedules cause problems, and where there are entry restrictions.Insurance is tricky though. Ours would have covered us if the UK government advice was not to travel unless essential. But as the UK hasn't said that about Korea we weren't covered. Just hoping that transiting through Frankfurt and Singapore won't cause us problems on arrival! We thought about other routes, but to be honest this could suddenly spike absolutely anywhere! Let us know how you get on John."
"Most travel insurance is great, that is until you make a claim. There are so many outs in the fine print of each policy that their only usefulness is to provide a false sense of security. If you have a document that claims to exclude ""acts of god"" be very wary."
See Korean are pulling flights to Australia and NZ.It comes as no surprise to those of us in Christchurch that when the excrement hits the fan that insurance companies behave as though their parents were not married.
"Where have you heard that Korean are pulling flights to Australia Mike? NZ yes, but I’m not aware about OZ.In fact, we have been told by Korean that out flight home on 17/3 from AKL is cancelled but that we can fly from Sydney on the same day. I’m currently trying to establish whether they will pay for a flight from AKL to SYD to catch it or whether we have to pay ourselves."
"Apparently Brisbane and Auckland suspended. Sydney reduced to 3 per weekhttps://www.koreanair.com/content/dam/koreanair/Global/Documents/about/코로나19%20관련%20비운항%20및%20감편%20현황(공지)_0304%200017%20-%20ENG.pdfDo not forget a transit visa (free) for Australia.Edited: 1:29 am, March 04, 2020 "
"John, not a good situation. https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/…we are cancelling our dream trip to europe due to the disruption to travel possibility. we cant afford to be stuck in italy and all countries banning flights or passengers from italy (like china). Its a massive financial hit for us as travel insurance wont cover our losses, but since you ae already travelling your insurance should cover it?"
"That’s a real shame for you poppy.I’m really not sure what line Korean will take on our situation - it’s clearly not their fault that they are caught having to cancel the AKL flights, so they may refuse to pay for the extra flights to SYD. I’m going to ask the 3 parts on the Air Travel forum for their views.I don’t yet know what line our insurers will take but right now it looks like our maximum exposure will be two flights so about NZ$630. Painful but a small sum compared to the overall cost of the trip or your losses poppy.Edited: 3:30 am, March 04, 2020 "
Surely if the airlines cancel you will be covered?
"#36 travel insurance companies have all sorts of exclusions for cases like this. We have a comphrensive policy with allianz. pandemics and epidemics are covered. But exclusions include government intervention. So since our government has put the bans, and self isolation in place travel insurance dont have to pay.out travel insurance said they wont pay for us to cancel or change our bookings because thats our choice.But then they also advise that we must not be aware of any circumstance which could lead to a cancellation or disruption claim during travel. So any travel not commenced after 28 feb is not covered for claims arising from coronavirus.our costs to cancel are in five figures. Hubbie has never been to Europe and its been a year in the planning and have a house sitter in our house, and had to get locum staff to cover at work. So it seems nearly all travel insurance can get out of coronavirus claims if you havent commenced travel yet. And then there are still clauses if you have.All the best John with your travel back home. You just snuck in before there are lots more disruptions i think."
"Strange. This year (well last July for this year) I took out with NZ Travel Insurance ,a partner of Allianz ,and reading through all the pages I have found that it does not cover for 'an actual or likely pandemic or epidemic or threat of a pandemic or epidemic' In the past, I have generally used 1Cover but, now that I have turned 75 their prices skyrocketed. I am not going to read their policy. The only claim I have ever made with 1Cover was for a lost Swiss Rail Pass in 2013 and they paid up the bit over NZ$400 without any fuss when I provided info about all the payments I had to make in lieu of the pass. I do not take out insurance when going to OZ as I mainly stay with relatives and have Medicare as an Aussie citizen although all Kiwis should have reciprocal care in Australia. Slightly regretted that 3 years ago when fog meant my flight from Dunedin to Christchurch was delayed and I missed my Emirates connection to Sydney, meaning an overnight in Christchurch and a new flight with Virgin the next morning. . The only time I flew as I usually catch the bus."
Poppy - is it not possible to at least take a credit on your flights for travel at a later date? I realise that this won’t cover your land arrangements but it would provide some recovery.
"#39 definitely looking into options. All our tours, accommodation were prepaid. many nonrefundable, as we had compnrensive travel insurance, to cover any cancellation - turns out they are wheedle out of just about anything except broken bones. The problem is it may not be any better in a few months and actually worse. Im considered high risk due to pneumonia"
"We all feel for you Poppy, but I guess that doesnt help much.We are in for a rough ride. Panic is here according to todays paper. See one poll shows only37% think our border restrictions are tough enough. Perhaps if the Government gets a bit more direct Insurance will have to pay.The time has come to sit it out. We took a hit to the ecconomy in the 70's when we lost biggest trading partner, but we adapted. If tourism takes a hit we need to adapt to getting something with better jobs, something more sustainable.Perhaps Kiwi staying home and spending money there will balance things a bit."
"#41 thanks nzmike. we just cancelled, a huge hit financially but the self isolation imposed by returning from italy, and possibility of cancellation of flights is too great. although coronavirus is way more in nz than authorities state. they just arent testing many people cause it would damage our tourism and exports and imports too much."

Conspiracy theories dont help.It would be impossible to keep that a secret. Far too many people employed in too many levels of the health system.My concern is about the effect on Kiwisaver balances.
#44 they will bounce back. The economy taking a hit with people on leave is a big issue. Businesses around the world are going to suffer.

"You must have had a premonition Mike. Australia have now announced that anyone from or transiting South Korea is banned from entering OZ (a harder line than NZ now), Korean have cancelled their Sydney flights, presumably including the one we were rebooked on to.I guess we may now be down to a refund from Korean and buying new flights."
I read about the Australia situation this morning and thought your flight would be cancelled John. You might want to look at Lufthansa. That's who we have rebooked with. I would avoid Emirates as the UAE has just advised against all overseas travel so I expect that will result in flight cancellations from/to Dubai
Hmm. Think we are a bit soft. If evey one moves fast we might nail this and get it over quickly.
I’ve no idea where we are now Sally. I had just been advised that Korean are moving their clients to Emirates flights as they have an Interline agreement with them!
Good luck getting home John but hey NZ is not a bad place to be stuck in for a while as long as you have the funds.
