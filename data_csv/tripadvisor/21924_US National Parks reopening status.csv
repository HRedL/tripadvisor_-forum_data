"Hello. I'm wondering if there is a website where we can obtain the current updates and information on which parks might reopen sooner than others, and when this might occur, etc. Thanks in advance."
"Probably the individual official park websites will have the best information. Also, our local news outlets have posted information about the status of national parks in Utah. If you are interested in particular parks, check their websites and local news sources. You might want to monitor this website:https://www.nps.gov/index.htmBryce Canyon will reopen on May 6 with some restrictions.Zion NP will reopen some areas on May 13. There has been no information yet on Capitol Reef, Arches and Canyonlands. This is a guess, but I think Capitol Reef will probably be open fairly soon. Arches and Canyonlands may take longer.Edited: 3:55 pm, May 03, 2020 "
"Thanks for prompt reply, Connie. I will check those. - I wish there would be ONE source available for all NP updates and status."
Check the News Releases section (bottom of the page) on this NPS.gov link:https:/…public-health-update.htm
"This is a useful link, imho. Updates about the NPS response to the coronavirus will be posted on www.nps.gov/coronavirus. Please check with individual parks for specific details about park operations. As you get to the bottom of the page there is info on each park, etc.Edited: 5:53 pm, May 03, 2020 "
"Each park is a local decision. If a park gateway town doesn’t want people the park won’t open.Even though parks may open, things may be very different in 2020...such as1 no guided range tours2 no ranger evening talks3 some or all park lodging remaining closed throughout the year4. Some popular trails being closed or they could restrict access due to counts on who is there"
"Good points, Dan. Plus any activities/concessions/guides in the neighboring towns may or may not still be in business. imho, do not book anything that is non-refundable. Even Hertz is rumored to be preparing for bankruptcy. https://www.businessinsider.com/hertz-rental…I would be very cautious about 3-rd party bookings for this very reason. Book with Orbitz or Expedia, etc. and you have no standings in court."
"As noted, park openings are a very local decision made in concert with the parks along with local health and tourism officials. Given that, it would be impractical to manage a centralized listing. You can also expect that the parks are not going to post anything until it is final. You can oftentimes find more dynamic information on local news websites. Another good third party source for information is National Parks Traveler. https:/…coronavirusWhen making your plans, look not only at the act of the park reopening, but look further to find out what supporting infrastructure will be open in the community. Gauge that with anticipated groundswell of visitors that can be anticipated. You might think twice about a trip to a national park just as it opens. Think about health safety as well as the visitor experience you can expect.Have fun and stay safe."
"I know the Great Smoky Mountains National park has only opened the main roads through the park, no visitors centers and some of the trails and driving tours are still closed. Nearby towns are soft opening, mostly still outdoor dining but more seem to be opening as time goes on. Many things will depend on a reoccurence possibly happening if people who have the virus travel and spread it again."
"Near Las Vegas, Lake Mead Recreation Area (run by the National Park Service opened up last Monday (May 3) but only for pass holders (senior pass, national parks pass, local pass) with no cash or credit/atm card transactions... with many facilities (Visitor Centers, concessionaires (food or fuel) closed. Hoover Dam (run by the Bureau of Reclamation is still closed.Randy"
