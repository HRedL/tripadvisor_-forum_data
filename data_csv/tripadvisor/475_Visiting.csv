HelloComing to Portland to enjoy the coast with my granddaughter. Where in the city is all the fighting going on? I don’t want to go near there.Thanks

Now is not the time to travel anywhere. This was posted recently and it is worth sharing....https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g28958…
"No, do not come to portland . We do not want you or your granddaughter. Sorry, but that's how it is until covid actually subsides."
We are coming and enjoying the coast. Not coming to the city or shopping. Road trip!!!!!
"Please just stay home. We have no interest in travelers galavanting around. Even though you are not coming Portland (I assume that is what you mean by the city) or shopping, what about grocery shopping, eating, staying in a hotel, etc? This is not the time to come to an area where visitors are not currently welcome."
"So you’re driving from Tennessee? If you’re going to the coast and not doing cities, why are you even asking about Portland? ~ Colleen"
"When we left for our ""local"" vacation at the central coast in late June, we fully expected to come home to find our county had moved on to Phase 2 of reopening. Instead, Covid-19 exploded while we were gone.We had no idea just how bad the Covid-19 situation had become until over halfway through our stay when we were at an emergency vet and I decided to see what was up in the state. Where we stayed had no cell or internet access or TV.If our vacation was upcoming, I would not feel right to take it in light of not only the Covid-19 cases in Oregon but also the explosion of cases across the United States. And there is no way I would have traveled any real distance for a vacation during a pandemic that has no vaccine or reliable treatment. And that was before things got bad here. We had our masks. We wore gloves. We used hand sanitizer after removing our gloves. We used Clorox wipes and disinfected cards used to pay for the few groceries and take-out orders. I still wouldn't travel now if it involved any interaction with other people or staying in a hotel or motel or rental property or anywhere with a communal bathroom (campground.)I do not want to be someone who has it and doesn't know it. Who spreads it to an area with limited medical facilities like the coast. Who gives it to someone who then gives it to a person who is vulnerable.I do not want to take the chance that I could cause the death of someone I don't even know because I wanted to go on a vacation during an out of control pandemic."
"Of course I would never want to cause someone death.I went to Yellowstone 3 weeks ago and travel around Montana. We had a wonderful time and yes we wore mask. Everyone was enjoying there vacation as normal. The campground were full as well as rodeos and restaurants.I work in the public everyday and the children are going back to school. My granddaughter is 18 and needs something happy in her life. She didn’t get to finish her senior year, no prom, and now she can’t go off to college. She’s always wanted to come to Seattle and Portland, so we are coming. I’m not going to go around people any more than we have to."
"Silljunk,Montana is where we normally visit. My husband is from there. We have family that live there. We have friends who live there. There's no amount of money in the world I could have been paid to take my normal ""We only see a half-dozen people the entire trip"" vacation to SW Montana this year.Montana has seen an explosion in cases and masks are supposed to be mandatory now.The majority of the locals won't take it seriously. Bars are packed. No social distancing. Masks are a violation of free speech and law enforcement won't enforce the mask rules.Butte had a corn hole tournament for charity. The pictures show unmasked groups of people standing shoulder-to-shoulder. The people we know in Ennis said the rodeo was a nightmare of people going about as if there was no deadly disease circulating.The county we normally stay in near Yellowstone is seeing community spread. They have a hospital that has no ICU beds. They have a few doctors. That's it for the county for medical services. The people who have Covid-19 but aren't sick enough to be hospitalized in another county or bed ridden are not isolating because it's ""Just the flu.""But, you are going to come anyway even if the people who live here and are facing the prospect of businesses being shut down again, schools not reopening this fall, medical procedures such as cancer removal surgeries being halted again, and massive rises in unemployment again are asking you to put off your visit until the danger of serious, lasting, debilitating illness or even death is gone.People who may also have children or grandchildren or siblings or loved ones who also did not get to do their senior prom or senior class trip or walk across the stage to get their diploma or get to go off to college this fall.Please get a Covid-19 test before you come. I don't know if Tennessee is still doing free Covid-19 tests for anyone who wants them. I know my friends out there said anyone with ID could drop into a testing site and get the test.Make sure you keep track of the places you go, what time you get there, how long you stayed, and when you left. Anything you can do to help out the already overwhelmed contact tracers would be greatly appreciated."
"This is getting better & better. You aren't coming to the city and aren't going to go around people any more than you have to, but the trip is premised on the fact that your granddaughter who is incapable of happiness without a prom, etc has always wanted to go to Portland & Seattle. All righty. You betcha!~ Colleen"
"You are a smart mouth!!!!! This is a road trip!!!!!We can enjoy the beautiful beaches and scenery without getting around a large group of people. We are flying into Portland, but are going to Cannon,Seaside and driving the coast to Seattle. You are so negative!"
"I’m listening to Fox at this moment and they said we know so much more about COVID now. There’s no need to stay locked up in your house. Children are going back to school and life needs to get back to as normal as we know normal now. The economy cannot get back until we(USA) gets back to work, traveling and living our life with the new normal. COVID is not going away!!!!! We will learn to live with it! Go somewhere and enjoy!"
Did Fox tell you Portland to Cannon Beach is just an hour and a half...not a road trip? Or that you can't drive up the coast to Seattle from there because 101 goes boringly inland? Or that you can't escape the crowds on the northern Oregon coast this time of year because along with tourists all of the Portland metro area also wants to go to the coast?Watching Fox News for travel advice makes even less sense than watching it for objective reporting.
Negative Nancy a road trip is going somewhere different everyday. Don’t know where just a road trip to enjoy 5 days! Get a life!
"Our forums are getting clogged with silly junk, stubborn refuseniks, inconsiderate covid spreaders and just rude travellers. Expressing our concerns falls on deaf ears, our itinerary and drive time advice is ignored. Our fears are ridiculed. My patience with such self centered fools is exhausted."
"You lost me at ""watching Fox...."" No objective news sources in Jackson?"
"Silljunk: Please, what is wrong with you? Are you not aware of the dire situation our Country is in? What part of ""please stay home, we do not want you"" do you not understand?"
"Someone from New Jersey was seeking Oregon TA advice recently for an Oregon itinerary and matter -of-factly stated they’d just been to Utah, Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. This OP just travelled around Yellowstone and now wants to come here. “I want to, I deserve it, I will” seems to be the reasoning. Oregonpoppa, Mtngrl, Colleen, tallandcool, luvbeachgirl - please continue to be the voices of reason on this subject. Perhaps the state can go the way of Bend which issued an administrative order asking tourists to stay away."
Selfish and very irresponsible!! Plain & simple. People like this are the reason the virus is spreading. Oh...and no. Kids are not going back to school. At least not in my state. Stay home!!
We are going back to school August 3rd. Schools are open and children need to learn!
"Ok, this is not selfih or ugly. Children have been learning and will continue, epecially by example. Your granddaughter deserves the example of respect and caring for all people."

"I do travel locally some, mainly to our cabin or with trailer but I wouldn't want to get on a plane and fly way out here. Seems like a hassle and so many inconviences right now. I would stay and visit beautiful places in your area. I know there are nice places there. We have a much younger friend in Nashville and she's at real outdoor person. Good luck if you do come. But I would close this thread out as it's not serving you or anyone else.If you do come and stay in Portland for a night I would stay here:https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g52…https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g52…https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g52…https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g52…https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g52…Close to all the good entertainment you are looking for. I've been down in the area almost weekly walking around. Real nice right now.Edited: 6:14 pm, July 21, 2020 "
Thank you so much!
"You are clearly out of touch with reality and just plain delusional. The example of ""We are entitled!"" you are setting for your granddaughter is beyond pathetic. Showing her it is ok to ignore public health and safety is not only irresponsible it can actually kill people. Ironic considering you say you don't want to cause anyone's death. Lie much?? Stay home!!!"
"Thank you so much for the hotel, but we are going on a road trip. Driving down the coast and enjoy the scenery and to Bend Oregon. We will only be there 5 days and will spent more of our days in the car.I’m as safe there as I am at home. COVID is everywhere."
"Bend??? You need to check news! Bend has issued an Administrative Order asking all tourists to stay away due to Covid , plus that area is experiencing extreme fire danger. You really need to regroup and consider what you are doing. (for your granddaughter's sake and our sake and everyone else you encounter. ) This trip is totally not reasonable."
Thank you for the information on Bends.
"You state that you have been tested. You do realize that the test results are only good at the moment you were testing. If you left before receiving results and saw ANY other human, you could have become infected. Testing and then coming to Oregon does not mean that you are safe for any of us.Stop watching fox news (get your head out of the sand).As stated, please DO NOT come to Oregon right now. The coast is having issues with the rise of COVID due to people traveling there. Bend is at high alert. Numbers in Portland are going up, due to too many people thinking like you...we can travel and do what we want.Re-think your plan and come another time.It is a bummer that your granddaughter did not get the usual high school experiences this year. Many of us have not have our regular experiences. Boo hoo. We will get over that, as long as others do not infect us with COVID."
"I'm another mom of an active duty son who doesn't appreciate silljunk's faux ""patriotism"". Don't even go there. Just...do not. Schools are not starting as per norm, as evidenced by your daughter's collegiate experience, or lack thereof. The Jackson, TN school district is aiming to begin classes August 24, with traditional or virtual path options. They are struggling to find a way and crossing their fingers, like so many districts. There's of course no reason to try and engage thoughtfully with an irrational person. But do at least look at a map and genuinely figure out what you're doing. Your posts indicate that you don't have a clue about where you're going or what you're doing. ~ Colleen"
"For your information I have a son action military as well.Yes, Jackson, Tn will be going back to school August 24 but Medina, Tn is going August 3rd!"
"Please stop feeding silly junk. Her reasoning is inane. Her claims and facts dubious at best. And her self avowed love of flag, country and the Bill of Rights all self serving.Those of us who have actually served in uniform recognize real sacrifice and service. Silly junk is all about herself."
"Both thumbs up, oregonpoppa!"
You are so wrong!!!!!
By the way I’m a Trump supporter.

"The rioting is taking place mostly in the few blocks surrounding 3rd street and Madison. I work in that area, so I am pretty familiar with it. During the day, if there are protests, they tend to remain very peaceful. At night is when things can get ugly. It should be pretty easy to avoid, especially if you are heading to the coast. I'm sorry that posting a simple question has led to rudeness and insults. Portland is normally a very welcoming place and I'm sure you will find it so when you visit.Safe travels."
Thank you for your kindness.
"""Thank you so much for the hotel, but we are going on a road trip. """"Coming to Portland to enjoy the coast with my granddaughter. Where in the city is all the fighting going on? I don’t want to go near there.""So it sounded like you were going to be in Portland. Guess not. Good choice. I was giving you hotel locations so you would be safe........Again, I don't care what you do if you do if safely but still don't get why now? Why bother?Please close your post."
"Go straight to the coast after leaving airport and drive south. I always think the best part of Oregon is the coast. Some of my favorite coast towns: Manzanita, Yachats. It’s easier to keep social distancing out there. Wear mask and gloves when you go shopping for groceries. Life has to go on but take all the safety measures to minimize the risks for you and others."
"From the Oregon Governor ""Brown said Wednesday she is considering limiting tourism from other states into Oregon, particularly for people coming from coronavirus hotspots elsewhere in the nation. Officials in her administration are talking with leaders in neighboring states about options including “mandatory quarantine for people coming here from hot spots.”"

I’m only flying into Portland. I’m not staying in the city. Would not want to stay in the city!Going on a 5 day road trip. We always fly in and go wherever we end up at night. Best kind of trips
Guess the Governors comments do not apply to you.
"""It’s hard to understand why someone needs to be convinced to stay away from Portland and or Oregon. There is time in life to travel and see wonderful places. This summer just isn’t that time. Next spring or summer we can all hit the road, maybe with a mask, but this summer is too dangerous for many reasons, and Portland in particular is not a vacation destination.""Not necessarily picking on you, but people always state this like it is a fact that come 2021 the virus will go poof and we will all be able to travel wherever again. The reason I am traveling this summer is because it is allowed, and there are no guarantees it will be allowed this fall, or next spring or summer for that matter. There is no vaccine - and when there is one (IF there ever is one), less than 50% of the country will actually get said vaccine ..."
"MikeG--So what about the Governor's comments? Just because something is allowed does not mean it is smart. When locals are asking people to stay away, I cannot imagine going somewhere that I would not be welcome. That is really disrespectful, IMO."
"What comments? That they are thinking about instituting a quarantine for people coming from States that are hotspots? I mean sure, when they actually implement a quarantine, it would be silly to travel to someplace that required a 14 day quarantine. But, there is nothing implemented yet - and even if it were, they are talking about States who have a higher % rate right now, which would not apply to NJ, since we are one of the States with a very low rate currently. As for the locals asking people to stay away, that is not representative of ALL locals. I am sure the one's who own businesses would not share the same thoughts as yourself. Honestly though, I can only speak for myself, and I am not interested in traveling to Oregon (or anywhere) to hang out with, or meet the locals. I travel to go hiking, and take pictures."
"Mike, you are correct. This is not going away for awhile. It may never go away. I’m one of the 50% that will not get the vaccine. I work everyday in the public with a mask on and I don’t want to sit and wait for someone to find how to get this under control. The survivor rate is 95%. There’s been viruses throughout history and we have never closed the world down. If we don’t continue to live the USA will crash. I care nothing about being told what I can and can’t do with my life or where I can go. If we let them do this, we are in for trouble.As you can see there’s a lot of people falling for the BS. I care nothing about being in large groups and yes, I do wear a mask. We will spent 80% in the car, riding and enjoying the beauty of our beautiful country. Everyone has been on edge for months and it’s not helping, so I’ve decided life is to short not to enjoy it. We never know from day to day what life will bring. Only God knows that. I never in a million years expected to get the treatment I have because I ask a question."

"We just cancelled our Oregon road trip. Friends that have done road trips during COVID tell us it’s just not worth it. It’s a real PITA finding places to eat,crazy long lines and of course most importantly,risk of infecting others or what if we fall ill during the trip? I knew I’d have to cancel but was hoping for a miracle that things would improve! Even though we haven’t been out,mostly stick to just hiking around our neighborhood (and our little town hardly has any COVID) we felt like it was the right thing to do.Oh! The worst part of road tips?! Finding a restroom !Edited: 1:44 pm, July 24, 2020 "
We traveled a month ago to Yellowstone. Everything was good. I loved having fewer people there. Visited several towns and everything was great. No long lines and most of the restaurants were open. Everyone was so welcoming!
"Yeah they don’t have Covid too bad there. We have friends that did road trip SF to coastal parts of Oregon and found it challenging with getting food/restrooms. I could be wrong by believe Oregon is also stuck in phase 2 (like us here in SC County.)I did take a trip to Monterey Bay once restrictions were lifted on June 19th and it was great-no one was there. At that time we also were able to eat at restaurants too.Edited: 2:38 pm, July 24, 2020 "
Oregonpoppa...Hilarious how she thinks changing her screen name changes anything.She still needs to stay home!!!
I’m sick of y’all!!!!
The reasonable response if in fact you're sick of all of us is to stop posting here. Take care.~ Colleen

"Better to be sick of us, than travel here and either get sick, or make us sick. COVID is real and killing too many people."
I have a friend who is fighting Covid-19 and lost both her father and grandfather this month.Stay local.
"SAMPlife, that is so sad, and scary. Sending get well vibes to your friend."
