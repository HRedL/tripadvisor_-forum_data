Why is Mexico not shutting travel from the USA? Both have incredible high covid infection rates. Mexican hospitals are overwhelmed. Mexico is going to peak in September. As a Canadian I would travel if Americans are banned. We have dealt with covid properly.
"I see both sides of this one; being Canadian and looking from the outside, I too wonder why they would not allow non-essential travel into Mexico, with countries having such high rates of infection.But then imagine if the province or city that you lived in, within Canada had very high rates and you were told that you were not able to travel, because other people were infected. My hope is that if US citizens do travel, that they take the utmost in precautions, wear masks, and maybe do a self-quarantine IF they are coming from a city or town with high rates of infection. I am absolutely all for people having to provide evidence of being covid-free, via a test of some sort, but that too would be like herding cats, trying to get everyone into be tested, and results in hand before a flight.Canada is taking the right steps, we have shut out country and provinces down and the spread while not stopped, is not out of control. We will remain with very tight social distancing measures, mask by-laws, people working from home until this stops or slows down. We as a country did not allow the provinces to just freely open up beaches, bars, parks just because the weather was nice and people were getting 'antsy'.I have a trip planned in about 6 months from now, and for me personally it's up in the air still! Game day decision, IF my air carrier doesn't cancel the flight, IF beaches are open, IF Mexico's numbers are low and IF I remain healthy, and the numbers in my town remain low, which right now is or was 9, out of 60,000.I would be interested to know, what percentage of tourists in the area are typically from the USA vs Canada?"
"My thoughts are that some areas of Mexico, like Cancun, have become so desperate to restore the tourist traffic and income that they simply don't care what happens. Combine that with Americans that are foolish enough to go, and this is what you get. I would say that currently there is a pretty strong sentiment in Canada that Americans are not welcome here, although there is the same economic pressure from those that depend on the seasonal tourist activity from the US. My expectation is that the Canadian border will remain closed to everyone at least until the end of the year.Mexico and the US have two of the fastest increasing death rates in the world currently.https://tinyurl.com/y492v4bj"
"I totally agree. The USA doesn’t even have a clear national plan and they are no where near being in control of this virus. More countries should be banning them. I have a trip in October that was planned pre covid, but will likely cancel. I might not if Americans were banned."
"I am from the US, a suburb of Chicago. We were in a Huatulco the beginning of March, when everything was starting to hit the fan here. I missed having to quarantine for 2 weeks upon return by only one day. I am in fitness, work in three different health facilities and was furloughed from two, was able to work virtually from one. The Chicago area was pretty much a hot spot for awhile but with strict guidelines, we pulled it in. Social distancing, mandatory masks. Things are slowly starting to open up but I’m afraid the younger generation is going to put us back by large group gatherings. I have returned to teaching fitness classes in person with strict guidelines as to how many people can be in a room, social distancing, cleaning off anything you touch before and after, and wearing masks. Even tho it isn’t “normal”, it feels good to be back. Surprisingly, no one complains and everyone is really good about the new rules. My daughter lives in New York, which was a real hot spot for awhile. They have reined it in. There is a COVID testing site set up at the local high school that I went by every day during the quarantine. There were never more than a dozen cars in it. I personally do not know,of anyone who has/had COViD. I’m not meaning to act superior or make this less than a pandemic, I’m just saying us Americans are not all running rampant over the neighborhood. I agree that if all Americans (or anyone everywhere) were made to wear a mask, this would be all over with. Will I travel without a vaccine? Yes, only if quarantine restrictions are lifted and it is safe to do so. I am certain masks and social,distancing will be in place for quite awhile, even with a vaccine. All I can hope for is some kind of a treatment to lessen the severity of the virus. And I find that the majority of the tourists coming to Huatulco (that I have met anyway):are Canadian.. It is not easy to get to Huatulco from the US and I personally prefer it that way. You have to really want to go there to endure most of the long layover flights. Ok, said my piece. Don’t crucify me too much because of where I come from."
"Well said playamomma, some very sensible comments."
"Thank you for your input, well said but there are 60000 covid cases in Chicago, we have 110000 cases in Canada. When one third of America just thinks it is a flu, it worries me. Supposed to go in November but we wear masks here and take every precaution. It is always going to be someone being cavalier that ruins it for the rest of us.Edited: 4:43 pm, August 08, 2020 "
"Great commentary, PlayaMomma, well said. We are all in this pandemic together, and we need to be kind to one another still, above all :)"
"To protect other people on the plane as well as the local residents, people should not be flying to Huatulco unless they can be 100% sure that they are not infected with COVID-19. At the present time this is almost impossible to do and things like temperature screening simply do not work well enough to indicate that someone is a carrier. The asymptomatic nature of COVID-19 for so many people makes it a truly difficult disease to manage. We all need to be patient before embarking on such non-essential travel. It is not a ""personal decision"" if it has the potential to negatively impact many others."
"Exactly, Non-Essential travel. Anytime you leave you home you are putting yourself at risk. Covid doesn't select nationalities, rich or poor. You make your choices as to how important your travel is compared to the risk. Your choice. One could leave their home without covid. When you arrive at your hotel or rental a chance you may have been infected. Uber driver, airport check in , using rest room at airport or plane, everyone at the airport, passengers in the plane, pilot, flight attendants, check-in folks. Landing, immigration, baggage handler, customs, transport and on an on. your choice. But of course bumping into an ugly American can ruin your day."
"Unfortunately, the cases in Huatulco are increasing at a quicker rate: this evening's report indicates 66 confirmed cases plus 34 additional “suspected” cases and 11 confirmed cases are active.However, because of the sparsity of testing, a multiple based on other measures is useful in interpreting these numbers: some experts say a multiple between 20-50 is reasonable; for example, there has been a 50-fold increase in health complaints related to pulmonary distress.The cases appear to be increasing as more tourists have been coming.For more information, see:https://coronavirus.gob.mx/datos/Our thoughts and prayers are with all of those who are affected.Stay safe. Be well.CH"
"So MA- you’ll go to Mexico with its high contagion and fatality rates, lack of testing, etc- but ONLY if people from the US are banned? Yup- ummmm ok sure. Whatever......"
Too bad nobody told Mexico that banning American tourists was the cure!
"Ukie, I've bumped into a few ""ugly Canadians"" on vacations as well - every country has 'em!Edited: 11:50 am, August 10, 2020 "
"Christy, to be fair, St. Albert might have a population of 60K but it really is a part of Edmonton (>1,000,000) physically and geographically. I live in Edmonton & work a few blocks from St Albert and there are thousands of cars going both into & out of SA every day. For all intents and purposes you are part of the big city - like it or not!Edited: 11:54 am, August 10, 2020 "
"Current status of both the US and Mexico are that the borders are closed to each other save for ""essential travel"". So both sides have similar restrictions, and anyone going for vacation is ignoring the status, which I find very selfish.But that said, I think there are myriad reasons why it remains open. Economic necessity for Mexico almost certainly, and keeping diplomatic relations with our current idiot administration another. I'm praying for a reset on Nov. 3 when we vote, and then a subsequent reset of our nation's covid handling. I don't deny that we've done abysmally as a nation. But it's equally galling to be included in a generalized count of all Americans. In a country of 320 million people and 50 states, there are significant differences in the way we've faced the virus and reacted to it. My county has less than a 1/4th the US average because we've taken it seriously. In fact, our county % is virtually identical to that of the nation of Canada."
"It's unfortunate that this thread was titled ""Americans"". It really applies to anyone who is travelling right now to Mexico for a vacations - both domestic and international tourists. It is very easy to go to Cancun and the Riviera Maya at the present time for international tourists including those from Canada, the US, Europe and South America. This is a pandemic - people need to stay home."
"Keisha- the post was intentionally titled “Americans” and it was ignorant. I don’t think any non essential travel is a good idea right now but the original post was laughably ignorant. I guess not all Canadians are polite, smart or reasonable. Who knew?"
"I read the original post again and it certainly is ignorant. No, not all Canadians are polite, smart and reasonable. Try living in the Texas of Canada for a while (i.e. Alberta)."
"Sorry LoveHuatulco but not true! I literally have not left my city, I barely leave my house and my groceries are delivered, and sanitized upon entry. I work from home and have such little contact with anyone outside of the bubble. You don’t know how people live their lives.Edited: 4:56 pm, August 10, 2020 "
"Uggg, as a Canadian I am truly gutted by the original post....and at a loss for words...This world kind of sucks right now.We all need to stay home.Be kind, be calm and be safe...."
"I am a polite, university educated British Columbian. USA is only allowed to fly Libya, turkey and Mexico. Canadians have self isolate for 2 weeks when returning from any foreign country. Strangely, USA citizens do not have isolate when returning. It would deter American travel to Mexico, if so. Why Mexico is allowing Americans is alarming. 1 in 2000 have died from covid, and their testing is disorganized. Let Mexico deal with covid and then let us visit and enjoy their amazing hospitality."
"' The Americans ' will be much more popular,when they come up with the vaccine"
Good possibility will never be a vaccine. Not one for the common cold. Must be vigilant and have infection rate below 1 now
"No question, the percent positive rate must be low in order to determine if your efforts are being effective in controlling the virus. It does require constant testing and quick turn around of results. Here in Ontario, testing totals are approx 22-25K per day with a population of approx. 14.5 million people. Our percent positivity was 0.5 % today, an excellent number indicating fewer and fewer infectious people walking about. No one can predict what the future will bring, but hand washing, physical distancing and wearing a mask when indoors sure seems to have worked here so far."
Sweep hard neighbor and go Blackhawks!!!
"Actually I Do know how ""people live their lives"" and I can tell ya there Barbie that most don't have the options you have. Have a nice life (I'm sure you will)."
I am not aware of what countries we are “ allowed” to visit but I do know that I would have to quarantine for 14 days if I even went to another state.
"I don't buy the no vaccine stuff. There are too many trials reporting good results in phase I and phase II trials. Typically they are getting an immune response 2-3 times greater than the response from actually getting COVID. It most likely will not be a once in a lifetime vaccination though. Probably will be annual like the H1N1 flu vaccine. We are in really deep trouble if there is no vaccine. A few trials have determined that the infection rate of the total population is in the order of 1%. At 3% a year it is going to take 30+ years for everyone to get immunity naturally, and of course by then the natural immunity will have fizzled. I think a vaccine is our only hope."
"@m a: That truly was an ignorant post. Saying you would travel if the U.S. was banned was ridiculous. You could catch it on the flight to Mexico and infect people there when you arrive. I'm embarrassed for you. You sure don't speak for this Canadian. And if you live in Sooke, B.C. you can see our numbers are climbing in this province. We could spin upwards and out of control at any time here. We've doubled cases in 1 month (July to Aug). So saying we've dealt with covid properly is not really true as it's not anywhere near being over. We really haven't even started to deal with ""2nd phase"" yet that's supposed to start up in the fall..."
Re: post #27 - that isn't true at all. Some states have such a 14-day requirement but most don't and that is one of the problems with the approach in the US (and in some other countries in the world including Canada to some extent). Specific regulations are put in the place at the state and not federal level. Most states do not have a 14-day requirement when you return from an international trip for example.
"I agree, Keisha, that it should be across the board nationwide. I was only commenting on my particular instance."
Got it. You are from one of the states that is taking COVID-19 seriously.
"Again not ignorant, well educated and open minded. You know this could all been prevented if we had listened to the experts. Trump ignored the playbook and de funded every agency which would have warned us that air travel without safety precautions would lead us to where we are now. Been predicted and forecast for years. A respiratory droplet virus would infect the world. Easy to hold accountable."
"I really have met some amazing Canadians over our years of travels. Have had lots of great times with them. But wow talk about getting thrown under the bus....... I could say more but it would just get ugly.I am one of those ""ugly Americans"" who just traveled to Mexico, Cabo San Lucas, to be exact and had a great time. EVERY Mexican national we talked to were sooo thankful we were there. Yes, they are being very careful, mask, distancing, etc, with guests, but they are starving!! While I was enjoying a quiet, low key, relaxing trip I managed to help some people put food on the table, so I feel pretty good about that. If you want to stay home. STAY! No one is forcing anyone to travel. Just because you can't/won't doesn't mean the rest of us have to hide."
"CH, where are the tourists coming from, that a lot of people are viewing as culprits in the pandemic increase? Are we talking travelling Nationals? foreign travellers?, who is targeted as contributors to the increase of cases? While I can understand the consequences of large scale hotels serving many guests And trying to curtail and contain problems, when we arrive to our home in Hux, we stay there, stay in our bubble, practice all the necessary precautions and will have taken all steps possible to keep everyone safe, including quarantine in our condo for a 2 week period on arrival. What is your opinion on the Covid Carrier Culprits?"
Yes a vaccine is what is needed. I have reviewed several studies and they are promising. With rates pretty low in Huatulco I would consider a trip in November or December but I could only stay 7-10 days and quarantining for 14 days there would be no point.
"Anyone who says that this ""could all been prevented if we had listened to the experts"" is poorly informed and unlikely to be open minded and well educated. One of the reasons that things have gotten so bad with COVID-19 is that the so-called experts were wrong on a consistent basis, particularly during the early days of the pandemic. They didn't think it could pass easily from person to person, they didn't think it was that serious, they didn't think masks would help that much, etc, etc. It's easy to blame the politicians but groups of experts like those in WHO and the CDC are just as culpable."
"JMHO, but I think at the beginning of this the 'Experts' downplayed mask wearing to keep the public from hoarding them at the cost of health care workers not having enough.  I work in health care and we had to reuse our masks for many days when this started. Not pleasant."
"""It's easy to blame the politicians but groups of experts like those in WHO and the CDC are just as culpable.""KeishaT...You're kidding right?"
"Perhaps I exaggerated a bit with respect to equal blame (and some politicians have been much worse than others in managing the pandemic) but, yes, the medical and scientific experts have very much let us down with respect to COVID-19 including predicting its occurrence (this was done in many scientific papers), basic characteristics of the virus, how the pandemic would likely evolve and in developing detection devices and treatments in a timely manner. I may sound harsh but I work in medical research so I am familiar with the field. WHO in particular has underperformed due to political issues. Trip Advisor isn't the place to debate people's opinions on this so best to let this matter rest. We can agree to disagree. Yes, hindsight is genius but we do need to have reasonable performance expectations for the billions of dollars invested in medical research. I suspect we are going to see a lot of changes in the future to help reduce the probability of another COVID-19 event."
"Every place that opens,it spreads,every place that closes,it slows, not rocket science,the problem remains that,at some point everyplace is going to reopen,vaccine or no vaccine,it’s human nature"
Thank you. Been fascinating. This can be closed now.
"These stupid discussions just keep going and going. No one knows the best path yet and who has chosen the right one. Sweden looked bad for awhile while its “remain open” policy but they may end up the smartest as cases/deaths have now dropped rapidly. Without a vaccine Mexico and The US may look right if cases fall a couple of months from now while Canada is forced into a total lockdown this winter or they open and cases explode there. Look at the US, the East coast states went through hell, while states like California looked good and locked down, but now California has exploded and the East Coast declines. Bottom line, no one knows right now."
"That is the biggest challenge - no one knows what is going to happen. It's unfortunate that so many ""experts"" are not willing to admit this although this has been changing. That is the point I was trying to make."
"Re: #42 ""Thank you. Been fascinating. This can be closed now.""m a - You started the post on this travel forum- hopefully you know you can delete it..make it all go away, far, far away,Edited: 2:49 pm, August 12, 2020 "
"Sadly, the confirmed COVID-19 cases in Huatulco continue to increase: this past evening's report indicates 75 confirmed cases plus 27 additional “suspected” cases and 13 confirmed cases are active. Six unfortunate souls have died.Because of the sparsity of testing, a multiple based on other measures is useful in interpreting these numbers: some experts say a multiple between 20-50 is reasonable; for example, there has been a 50-fold increase in health complaints related to pulmonary distress.The cases appear to be increasing as more tourists have been coming.For more information, see:https://coronavirus.gob.mx/datos/Our thoughts and prayers are with all of those who are affected.Stay safe.

"Novel covid-19 is by definition a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.I'm not sure who the ""experts"" are that some people are referring to given there were none. I have repeatedly heard Dr. Tam, Dr Fauci and Dr. Tedros Adhanom spokesperson from the WHO state on an on going basis that ""We are not sure, We don't know and we have to look at the data before we can formulate a scientific opinion on the matter."" It was when the virus became politicized by various world leaders our problems began. As more knowledge grew so did the changes in how the scientific and medical community expressed these changes to the public. The most successful countries combating this virus allowed science to rule public heath initiatives rather than politicians. By the way Sweden had more deaths per capita than all the other Scandinavian countries combined.Edited: 12:24 am, August 13, 2020 "
