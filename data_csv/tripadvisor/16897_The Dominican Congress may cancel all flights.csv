Ok....I just read on another post that the Dominican Congress may cancel all flights FROM AND TO all affected countries. Will they make a decision today???? 
I hope so.
Me too.....If they do indeed cancel all flights we'll be screwed because we didn't get the insurance! I hope the airlines and Hotels will be accommodating to this issue. 
Is this a serious possibility? Any idea of a time period? 
"Does anyone have a link to the article about the possible flight ban? I saw the link on the other post about the girl suspected of having swine flu, but I didn't read anything in it about the Congress deciding to ban flights. Unless my Spanish is a lot worse than I think it is...Thanks! :)-Lori"
oh great..We're set to arrive on May 12 for our wedding..
I hope this doesn't happen. It will disappoint me no end and have a huge impact on the Dominican economy. :~(
"In all fairness, I don't think that's the biggest worry of all... We are againts an epidemic that could spread wordlwide and I agreer that one way to stop it from affecting one whole nation is cancelling trips to & from countries that have cases reported.Look at this supposed case in DR. She arrived from Mexico, jus the same with the cases in Canada... In maxico they closed down schools, restaurants, and all normal activities.I am worried because I don't know HOW PREPARED CAN BE THE DR to front an epidemic like this.It can be fatal as its a country where there is no propper public health that reaches everyone. "
"~ It does not appear and is highly unlikely that the US and your vacations will be affected, just the millions from other countries that are now and will be stranded as they try to get in and out and safely home. When DR congress makes a decision I’m sure someone will post it on the board. PeaceLea"
"This would really suck. I need this vacation so bad and it is sooo close for me. On the other hand I can understand the DR side of this, because they do not have the same or maybe not enough healthcare for everyone in their country and it could be fatal for some. Feeling anxious now and just want to know what is going to happen. "
"What really annoys me about whats going on in DR at the moment, is that while there are chances that this flue will become worldwide PANDEMIC, the Public Doctors in the DR are ON A NATIONAL STRIKE SINCE TWO DAYS AGO asking for higher salaries.Can you believe it? "
Monica I saw that too. 
"Maybe I'm being slow but I'm not understanding your reasoning Lea. The US has many confirmed cases so if the US will not be affected by this, what countries will?"
"I don't see any info on the Internet, but its been all day on the radio.There is a famous politics related progam called ""El Gobierno de la mañana"" (FM Z101.3) and they are talking right now about the Congress discussing it, and the urgency to take some inmidiate desitions."
Monica please keep us posted! I am suppose to leave Friday morning. 
Many confirmed cases? what? 66 people out of 300 million have confirmed cases at this point. That is .00000022% of our population. More people than that fly into PC in 20 seconds!!! 
This flu is popping up worldwide now. It's too late to shut down the airports. I'd be amazed if it hasn't already entered DR.We can only hope for the best. Most affected people are recovering fine on their own. Some won't.The best precautions are being vigilant about hand washing and being aware at all times what you're touching. Try to stay away from closed indoor areas. Keep windows open as much as you can. 
Thanks Monica for keeping us posted! I know we all appreciate it. :) -Lori
"MonicaJust a thought if you did ban all flights from all infected countries how many tourists do you think would be entering DR for the next few weeks/months??Now let me see take out all the people who come from the US, Canada, Europe - I think you would have very few people left"
"farve 2 free... ""many"" cases as compared to other countries that are less affected, not in comparison to our overall population. "
"MonicaSDQ,Public Doctors on strike!,then DR congress should make the best possible decision to safeguard the Local Inhabitants/population first,surely The DR Government should see this as a priority over tourism and act sensibley,until It all subsides!!.tonky"
I'm set to come down to Punta Cana on Saturday. Is there a realistic chance that the flights are going to be cancelled?G Man
i hope this flu blows over soon . for everyones sake 
"My point is, we WILL have more confirmed cases than alot of other countries. We have more people. You have to go by percentages. Mexico has a popluation of 110 million people. 2,500 people have been diagonsed, and 159 dead with 1/3 the population of the US. They've had 159% more deaths, and 264% more diagnosed. I see why people are worried about Mexico, but why the US?"
"From Wikopedia:Tourism is the single biggest revenue earner, with receipts increasing more than tenfold from US$173 million in 1980 to more than US$2 billion by 2000. Successive governments have invested heavily in tourism development, creating upgraded airports and other infrastructure. Some 2.1 million tourists arrived in the country in 1999, not including visiting Dominicans. Most come from Europe, with about 25 percent originating from the United States or Canada. The country now has almost 70,000 hotel rooms, more than any other Caribbean country. About 50,000 Dominicans are directly employed in this sector, mostly working in hotels, and another 110,000 are indirectly employed as taxi drivers, tour guides, or tourist-shop staff.They are going to do everything possible not to cancel flights from Europe, Canada, and the U.S."
"I also forgot to multiply those percentages by 3 to give you a comparison to the US population....they've had 477% more deaths and 789% more diagnosed based on a poplulation. To get these numbers, I used basic algebra."
"I know flipflopman.... Tourism is the base of DR Economy, but heath in thsi situations should stick up.Look at it this way. (Which is what they were saying at the program)Dominican health authorities aren't as preparesd as the ones in the US or Europe, so there is a possibility that some cases may have entered the country without being yet noticed.With poor health conditions in DR, and a Medical strike along the country...isn't this a perfect cockatil for disaster to happen? Better safe than sorry..... "
"~ As I posted earlier this morning, it’s highly unlikely that the US will be affected and flights should go as scheduled.. Panic without proper knowledge and accurate information is upsetting. ….~ However…. It sure is going to get busy.… ~~ I just got word from a friend down in DR that the resorts are filling up at an uncontrollable rate and in all probability will be bursting at the seams. This is due to the overwhelming number of tourists that have now be re-routed from their original Mexican Destination ~ Let the bumping begin ~Chaos, I dare say ..Good Luck to all !PeaceLea"
This is like the malaria question in reverse!!!!!!!Perhaps all countries should ban flights to DR just in case we get infected by malaria?????I can see where you are coming from but personally I think any ban of the type suggested would set DR back about 10 years
I wonder how many staff the resorts had just laid off due to it being the slow season now?I'm sure it must be a mad scramble to get supplies too. Just imagine all the extra beer and rum alone they'll need? How about toilet paper? chaos is right :D
"First all all, the name of the post may mislead a littel bit.... the DR authorities are thinking of closing flighst from AFFECTED countries.!!!Thats totally correct Lea, the Hotels are receiving all bumped reservations from Mejico, which means all Hotel will be at overbookings..... and bumping reservations among themselves.(Im glad Im not in the business right now, I'de be meking a lot of calls looking for rooms at other Resorts.... )"
"Right, Monica ...Its a panic post, like the game of telephone ..PeaceLea"
"Hey Flip,Did you re-book yet?PeaceLea"
"Flipflopman said:This is like the malaria question in reverse!!!!!!!Perhaps all countries should ban flights to DR just in case we get infected by malaria?????I can see where you are coming from but personally I think any ban of the type suggested would set DR back about 10 yearsThere isn't an epidemic of Malaria in DR. If there was, Im sure that some countries, starting with Canada, with close flights. (personal guess)In the other hand, I think that DR would be sent back to medieval times if preffers profitable toursim over the health of the nation.As I said before, think of the poor health conditions in DR, a country where public heaalth doesn't cover all, and where there is a medical Strike going on.By the way, those doctors shoudl remember the vow they mede when became octors.... A stike at a time like this should be punishable.  "
"Obviously no one wants to minimalize the risk of a flu pandemic; however, it is appropriate to keep things in a proper perspective.This is a quote from the United States Communicable Disease Center:""Seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people globally in an average year.""I wonder if the media firestorm over the current outbreak is causing governments to overreact a bit?"
Ok here in Michigan another case this morning!My niece went to Mexico last week and I hope she is able to come home today.cant wait to hear what happen at the resort they stayed at.Rubyred
MonicaI did say there was an epidemic of Malaria in DR. The same as there is not an epidemic of swine flu in the effected countriesIn % terms at present the incidence is most likely the same. 
"Well the media along with certain posts on these boards is causing exactly what you think it wouldPANICI am from Scotland, and there is 2 confirmed cases of Swine Flu here, and go to PC on Sunday. So I am rightly concerned about what is going to happen.Its not like going to Mexico, if DR shuts its borders, Thomson Holidays wont refund us"
LeaNot as yet as we are holding out just now as we want to go to MexicoThat apart I think DR will be a bit busy for the next couple of weeks
"This is a quote from the United States Communicable Disease Center:""Seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people globally in an average year.""Exactly, people die every year from the common flu strains. This is a different strain that was originally concentrated in one country. So, it allows the media to create more drama and frenzy than necessary.That's not to minimize or downplay the seriousness of the issue, particularly in areas where health care isn't readily available to all people. Governments do need to follow it seriously, get information out to people to help minimize the spread, gear up for increased need for medical services, etc. I would fault any governemnt for not doing thses things and for not taking whatever precautions it can. However, the fear being spread by the media and just plain gossip, by uninformed people, is making the situation worse than it needs to be. "
"I think Lea nailed it....Chaos will soon reign in PC. I urge all of you with upcoming trips to pack your ""patience"" and an extra dose of ""chill"". Be ""mentally"" prepared for what may come your way i.e. being bumped, lines at ala cartes, shortages of palapas and chairs.And as a note...if ever there was a time NOT to play the ""towel game"" this is it. Be respectful of your fellow travelers, you are all in the same boat.I wish you all wonderful vacations.... "
"All I know is that not even dominicans feel safe with their public health system, and their capablility of detecting cases entering in DR.Specially know with a medical strike, and no doctors (only private) working.This is, no public doctors at Hospitals. "

I feel for the people who have been rerouted here from Mexico, but I have a right to be pissed off if its going to be over crowded!"
"How come so many Cancun'ers are being bumped to DR? What about other areas like Aruba, Bahamas, Virgin Islands, Barbados, etc? Why is is an automatic ""If no Cancun, then PC""??? Is it a cost similarity?"
donnelly...I understand. I'd be upset as well BUT there is nothing to be done for it. I see two options....Either change dates or locations OR go and make the best of what the situation brings. I'm not in the boat with you and can only cheer from the sidelines on this one. I hope it all works out for everyone concerned.
"Donnelly,I feel the same way but it's totally out of our control! I'm still going to go and have a great time....As long as they don't run out of Beer or Rum...We'll be having a great time. "
"The media likes to scare the s&*t out of people, it's their job. They did it with SARS in Toronto, they scared everyone including tourists, killed our tourism and then less than a month the problem was gone.The swine flu is not resistant to medication. There is medication that can be used and most of the cases have not been fatal, the fatality has only been reported in Mexico, you have to ask yourself why only there?IF you ban flights from the affected areas or where people have been diagnosed you are talking about an economic meltdown in DR as the tourism will DIE. Canada, US, and Europe have all had cases. All the cases have been people who have been to Mexico. "
Not saying its right but. . as far as the doctors on strike . . what better time time to push for what you demand when you are needed the most? 
"""To be selfish for a second, I booked PC out of choice, especially in May, because its quiet. I feel for the people who have been rerouted here from Mexico, but I have a right to be pissed off if its going to be over crowded""Yeah, you do have a right to be pissed. I would be too if I specifically chose a destination at a certain time of year because I expected less crowds. Unfortunately, for those who have vacations coming up in the next month or so, you're stuck with the situation. So, I think Obxbum's suggestion of trying to be respectful of fellow guests is probably the best way for everyone to be able to deal with the situation and still enjoy their vacation.There are going to be those who will feel upset because they booked vacations in DR instead of Mexico and those who feel upset because their trip to Mexico has suddenly been changed. put taht together with over crowding and impatience and you have the potential for a ruined trip.I feel bad for everyone who finds themselves in this situation.  "
"Monica is talking a great deal of sense. The Dominican Republic has very limited resources to deal with this disease here. Lack of tourism will have much less serious implications than an outbreak of Swine Flu on this Island where the hospitals are insufficient both in number and in resources to deal with hundreds or thousands of sick or dying people. I can understand the concern of people who are due to travel here in the next days or weeks, but hello!, this is about trying to put the best possible strategy in place to protect the country and it's people."
Were booked at Barcelo Capella in Juan Dolio (sp?) June 3-10 I am thinking it could go 2 ways - things could be smoothed over by then or peoples vacations will be backed up and over crowded...will hope for the best!
margadagio said something a few posts back that scared the crap out of me - what if they run out of beer and rum because of all the extra people? Now I'm really getting skeered.j
"I just read that the DR government has implemented a system to prevent the flu entering the country. All passengers arriving at the airports or by ship are going to be checked for fever and symptoms, you also have to fill out documents. IF you have any of the symptoms you will be quaranteened for 10 days. Also there has been a halt in pork products."
"this like the Malaria thing is getting so out of hand. Did you know 30,000 people in the US die every year due to the flu. Yes that breaks down to 4 people or so every freakin hour. we have had one death so far. Wow shut the borders. Mexico city has a population of 20 freakin million people. look at the percentages. not too high. News organizations every where sell more advertising when they get more site visits, people tuning in. Dont you all get it? "
I'm just back from punta cana yesterday and everything was as normal.everyone enjoying them self.There was little talk of the swine flu apart from the American tv channels
HA HA Yeh if they stock up on rum and beer it wont matter it will ALL BEEE OKKKKK!!!!!
I'm going to get Fired from work if I continue to monitor this post Every 2 minutes...As long as there BEER and RUM We'll be having a great time!

"They can take my tempurature if they so feel they need too, however, I'm not letting some random airport people stick some random thermometer in my mouth! People are going to get cranky, however, I suppose it is necessary."
What about the floods and locusts???
They are not taking your temperature from your mouth... Ouch!
"I'm with Laxin. As long as the booze is flowing we'll be ok. I'm not going to let panic set in. However, I can understand the concerns of the people that live in the DR, as far as the standard of medical care. Hopefully, all will be ok."
I'm in. It's all about the rum and beach!
"I live in N.S. about an hour and a half from the school where the 4 confirmed cases are.They are saying that 3 of the 4 have been cleared and are out of quarentine. The 4th is doing well.They are monitoring many with flu like symptoms but no one else has tested positive yet.That said, I know that many people here are pretty scared.A team at my son`s school played the school with the cases on the weekend at a tournament...after they had shut the school down because of the symptoms.It was said that none of the kids on the team showed symptoms and hadn`t been in contact with those in quarentine.Considering that the school is mainly a private boardig school where the kids all eat,sleep and work in the same areas, I think the school made a bad decision letting their team go out and play other kids.So far all the cases in Canada have been mild...much like a regular flu.However with all the deaths in Mexico, I personally, would rather limit the chances of exposure as much as possible until more is known.I`m booked for a two week vacation in PP in July and I`m hoping that this is all over and done with by then. However, I cannot blame the DR or any other country who tries to limit the chances of exposure right now.Especially countries where the medical care is already much less than desirable.I do feel though,that the chances are great that the flu may already be there...With so many travellers comming and going, and it being contagious before symptoms are even showing, we are going to see more and more countries reporting cases daily.Let`s just hope that the cases through-out the world continue to be mild and treatable and that it passes sooner than later..."
"Heat scanners give cold comfort during flu outbreak29 Apr 2009 08:23:27 GMTSource: ReutersBy Tan Ee LynHONG KONG, April 29 (Reuters) - Alarmed by the spread of a new swine flu virus, airports around the world have rushed to install temperature scanners to pick out the sick, but the microbe is proving too clever for modern technology.Experts say an infected person can easily pass through these heat sensors without detection as the incubation period for influenza ranges anywhere between one and three days.""The scanners won't pick up everyone (with flu), especially if they are too early in the infection ... People who have been infected very, very recently wouldn't show up on the scanner,"" Mark von Itzstein, director of the Institute for Glycomics at Griffith University in Queensland, Australia, told Reuters.""You can imagine somebody who is just infected boards the plane in Singapore and heads towards Hong Kong. There would not be enough time for the apparatus to pick it up because he would not have developed significant fever.""The new H1N1 swine flu virus, which has killed 159 people in Mexico, has been found in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Britain, Israel and Spain, but there have been no deaths outside Mexico so far.Asian airports, used to looking for H5N1 bird flu and SARS sufferers earlier in the decade, have dusted off their scanners for this latest crisis.But experts say these cannot help until the person has a fever, and an infected person can spread the virus around by coughing and sneezing a full day before the onset of symptoms.""Flu is infectious one day before the onset of symptoms, which means you may not have symptoms but you are already infectious while you are coming back to Hong Kong (on a plane),"" said Yuen Kwok-yung, a top microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong.""You are incubating and infecting others without knowing it.""Being cooped up in a place may spell trouble too.""A person with flu becomes infectious within 12 to 24 hours of infection. If he is travelling from Europe to Australia, a person can develop contagious capability while on the plane,"" Itzstein said.""It is an incubation spot, it is like a big incubator. People who are not infected can get infected in the plane.""Yuen urged people to practise ""self-quarantine"".""For those coming back from risky areas, you should do some form of self-quarantine and wear a mask for seven days.""

"I am one of the people who had to have their vacation plans changed and just successfully did this this morning. As far as choosing an alternate destination it was easy, however I had to pay an extra $500.00 to book something I was happy with (Bahia Principe) because you could accept something cheaper and lose the remainder that was already paid or pay more. If they cancel flights to DR I assume I will be in the same boat and have to pay more yet again.I too am worried about the over-crowding and sympathize with those of you who had originally booked DR. As a concerned Canadian I promise to be on my best behavior, I will also try to get the most out of my very over-priced vacationCheers, See you in the line-up for the bar"
"I think we will shortly be seeing posts about people being ""bumped"""
Being Bumped is my biggest worry right now. Does that happen offten? 
When and where were you / are you going?
Ocean Blue...We leave Friday morning. 
Are there any further developments regarding decisions from the Dominican Congress? Any idea when they would make a decision?
"I was booked at The Grand Palladium Colonial in the Mayan Riviera, but now we are at Bahia Principe Punta CanaFlight times are unchanged:Fly out from Toronto May 8 11:00 amIf they cancel flights coming in I'm screwed :("
"People seem to be assuming that all those not going to Mexico will go to Punta Cana - personally I doubt that very much.Most will probably rebook their Holiday for later in the year and the rest will scatter to other destinations including the DR.May is probably the quietest month of the Year in the DR so I doubt it will notice that much, so don't get too worked up about it.imo.snooks"
"I'm kinda worried about being bumped from the IBB, but I'm more frustrated because I booked PC in May to be relaxed, and now if all these people that were going to Cancun come to PC and make it a Cancun party environment, it's not exactly what I was looking for."
favre_2_free I agree! Not much we can do though. I am going to make the best of it! 
"If you read many of the Mexican Forums you will see that ""people"" are deciding where they should go.In any ""crisis"" like this where a lot of people are on the move the business practice of price and demand kicks in and many people are finding that a lot of destinations such as Aruba, Jamaica, Bahamas have been hiked up in price and DR seems to be pitched at a switch across level + a few $'s and I think this is a big factor in why so many people are selecting itResorts in DR IMHO have to be very careful in how they react to this spike in demand"
"Im personally not assuming. I know for fact they are doing so, from Europe at least.The majority of Hotel Chains present in both Mexico and Dominican Republic are spanish, and they have decided to bump tehir reservations to Dominican Repblic, (as thy do in case on Hurricanes too), because of the similarities of the destination, specially from the price range point of view.This option makes much more sense than rebooking for anotehr season, when prices may be higer. Not ony the President oh the Hotel Asosiation announced, but I've heard it also directy from some Hotel managers."
"We travel every year in May (for the lat 8 yrs). I enjoy this time because it is relaxed, with great weather and not so crowded. We leave in one week for Elegance.That being said... I don't think the extra displaced vacationers will be so bad. I enjoy meeting people and as posts earlier stated with the Beer and Rum available, the great beaches and weather, what could go wrong. Thank you to every one who has posted with an open attitude and an unselfish outlook. Those that are more worried about the welfare of the country you are visiting vrs. one or two weeks of your vacation. I love to hear the positives.I too am worried, however in the last 10 years my husband and I have learned to make the best of most every situation. We are lucky to be able to travel. Many are not. Beachbell "
From the UK point of view the tour operators which is really down to 2 very large ones now would have to lay on extra flights to accommodate bumping the guests - so far I don't see this happening.Of course in the US/Canada many book flights seperately and they are more likely to change destinations.If there are no more flights from the UK then there won't be many more people coming.snooks
MonicaI have read dozens of post from people in the UK and also had dozens of PM's and all these guests are making there own arrangements. The media here in the UK has also given a lot of coverage to people being left in the lurchI have not seen one comment by someone to say that their hotel had moved them. 99% people here in the UK book through agents and not direct and people are having to pay any increase in costs which in some cases has been substantial
We actually rebooked our destination from Mexico to Punta Cana...leaving tomorrow!
"Any more news/updates on the flight situation,and are the Doctors still strike ?"
"Good Morning netty,~ Again I'd like to state, please understand that this is a panic post. DR Congress convened with no such decision to halt flights from the US, Canada or Europe. In my opinion only accurate information published by reputable sources should be posted as “possibilities”, otherwise they are known as rumors and that is very disturbing right now for folks that are getting ready to travel in light of all that’s going on.~ Again ….. There has been no action thus far on DR officials to shut down flights coming out of the US, Canada or Europe. Happy & safe travels to all !!PeaceLea"
" Hi yes I am also one of the poor soul's who had to cancell there holiday to mexico and pick the DR wich was not my first choice and the price have gone out of the roof on monday the holiday to punta cana was £889 and by tuesday lunch time it had gone up to £1,060 just under £200 pounds more its us that is suffering not the travel agents they are raking in the money so for the people who regular to the DR will have to put up with the crowds lol we will all have a great time happy holidays ann x"
"Lea,I thought this was written by a reliable source. Monica wrote on another post in this forum:""In the other hand, The Dominican Congress is right now at this very same moment deciding on cancelling all flights FROM AND TO all affected countries, after a young mexican girl arrived to the country with signs of the disease.""If you have information that this is incorrect, please let us know. I thought it did come from a reliable source and that is why I was very worried. It's not like this was just a rumor laxin16 made up."
"Hi jocie41317,~ I did not want to be rude and not respond to your question. I am not prepared, nor will I comment on anything anyone else posts. I am only responsible for what I post.

"Lea, that's all I was looking for. Please keep us updated with developments if you hear anything. This is a very stressful time for all of us planning on traveling during the next couple of weeks."
You bet : >PeaceLea
"Thanks Lea, you have put my mind at rest, we are arriving on the 10th May for two weeks staying at Dreams PC.Realise that the Island will be a lot busier than a normal May (good for the economy).Ann I am sure there will be plenty of room for everyone, and you are right we must all stick together.I just pray that this horrid virus gets stopped in its tracks and the people of Mexico can get back to normal soon.Annette"
"I dont think that Congress would cancell any flights, it would cost them to much money, tourism is there hole economy."
"HI every one, i hope they don't cancell would not like an other day confined to the lounge sorting a new hoilday out all that stress ready for chill down lol, prayers for the poor souls who have the flue and the poor little boy who lost his life to this flue god bless his little soul ann xxx"
I am starting to freak out. We are leaving on Saturday from Cincinnati and staying at Bavaro Princess. We have been booked since November and it is a party of 17. We all booked separate so do you think they would rebook part of the party to other resorts? That would be horrible! We only needed one more booking to be considered a group but we couldn't find another couple to go with us. 
"I'm staying optimistic in this whole matter! So, NO you should be fine!Just inform the hotel prior to arrival that you are part of a large group! Remember, As long as they have beer and Rum you and your group will have fun....."
"Tonycoz,why you think we would not cancel flights from a specific location when found out that the specific location is bringing in something which would kill our entire turism from all locations?if a specific city get's called a housing for the virus you can bet that the flights from there will not be allowed to land here from the same moment on.and that would not be anything dominican specific, i guess that every responsible government would act that way in such situation.til right now:the DR is entirely free of the virus, not even one case found, the only one under 'observation' due to syptoms been a woman from mexico and finally been found not-infected.so i hope the countries who have it start all needed actions to keep it there and kill it there.happy travelsMike"
"to the large group travelling together:a large group booked as ""individuals/several families"" i would highly recomment to contact the resort nice on time prior to arrival and if possible the resort will suit the request.upon arrival it will most likely be impossible for the resort to bring so many rooms together in the same building/floor or such without prior notice about it.and keep in mind that it is a simple request, there's no obligation that the resort has to do so, but if possible they will suit such as near as possible.happy travelsMike"
The President of the Dominican Republic called me this morning and he reassured me that the resorts would not run out of BEER and RUM....That's all i needed to hear!!!!LOLReally....Does anyone have an update on this?Laxin
"MikeOn that basis why is the DR still accepting flghts from the UK, US & Canada to name but three????"
"The ""WHO"" called out yesterday for the Dominican Congress NOT TO CANCEL the flights from affected, as this measurres, they say, will only increase the panic.The Congress didn't take any desition, but the issue is not closed and right now they are talking again over the radio (""El Gobierno de la Mañana"" Z101.3) about the Urgency of closing flights from Mexico at least. The local population is demanding those flights to be closed ( interactive telephone calls)This program hosts everyday several number of polititians, and these days they are continuosly hosting The Ministry of Health.The reasons they are stating for the closure, are the same ones I mentioned on a previous post:1)The poor public health conditions in DR2)The almost imposible capability of detecting cases entering the country.3)A National Medical strike going on. (who is working at the airports looking for suspicious cases???)I understand and feel for everyone's economic losses, specially Mexico, but when we are talking about something so important and LIFESAVING as controlling a PANDEMIA, I think that drastic meassures must me taken.My health worries me more than my pocket, and I for one, think that they should be closed.I would be less worried if living In Europe, USA or Canada, where I know that customs are being ""protected"" with health inspections. But living here and knowing the curriculum of those working at local airports, and knowing the facts about a Medical Strike, it scares the **** out of me....."
"For your inforamtion, there are several daily flights beteween Mexico and DR, as there are excellent business relationship among both countries. Not just toursim related.Several mexican companies are based here, and many executives and workers travel continuosly between the two nations."
Thanks for the update MonicaSDQ...We leave in 14 days and we're keeping my figures crossed!!! 
My husband and I leave for Punta Cana in 6 days!! I'm so excited but I'm also getting worried! I understand that the DR needs to do what it needs to do to protect there country and citizens........I just hope flights aren't canceled from the US. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed!Emily
"Monica, Thanks for all your information. It is nice to have a contact person who will tell us what is going on there. We don't leave for our trip until May 27th so I am hoping some of this will be resolved. DR will probably have Swine flu there already. Hopefully this flu won't last too long and the milder cases we have seen in the US will be all we see. In a few weeks they maybe re-routing people from DR to Mexico. It seems week by week things are changing. I hope for DR and the doctor strike will be resolved. This could be disastrous for the people there. Keep us posted your doing a great job."
"to stop passenger flights between DR and Mexico, yes, i would vote for that action.FlipFlop buddy,while the US, Canada, UK, Germany aso have confirmed infected people they are def not the outbreak point of the virus and they are resonsibly treating their cases with all possible actions, there is at this point no need to stop flights from/to those countries, while mexico is clearly the housing/outbreak point, so as long as that is not solved in mexico and by the WHO named 'clear"" i plee for a stop of all flights to/from mexico.if any other spot/point/specific city would come out to be infected like mexico is of course i would recomment to any other country(not just the DR) to stop flights to/from that specific city/location also.but actually the birthplace is mexico and it should be isolated til the spreading of the virus is stopped.Mike"
"Sorry for not keeping you updated with this, but Ive been out of town.This is TODAYS information, regarding this situation:Yestarday afternoon, the DOMINICAN MEDICAL ASSOSIATION and the NURSING ASSOSIATION made a public Press Conference where they DEMANDED the Dominican Governement to cancel ALL FLIGHTS from USA MEXICO CANADA & SPAIN I saw in the TV, and they made some sense....They admitted not to be able to handle the situation IN THE EVENTUALITY that the disease came to DR.Their main argument for cancelling the flights is that, IN THE EVENTUALITY that the disease pass the dominican borders, they are afraid that the Local Authorities would automatically privilege the foreighn toursits (for Tourism protection reasons) over the local dominicans. http://www.eldia.com.do/article.aspx?id=65816(you can translate with babelfish)"
"Hi, I just read the article ( so did my Spanish boyfriend ) you had on your post. It does say that they have recommended to cancel flights from those countries, but they do so against organzations as OMS & OPS. It is not certain that the flights will be cancelled. So don't loose hope people!I, myself, am going to the DR in 2 weeks, so I truly hope that everything will sort itself out. In addition it is important to remember that the flu has ""calmed"" down, compared to a week ago. Thanks for the info,Anna"
"The article is a very short version of what went on yesterday.Yes, in the article(and during the press conference) they stated they are aware that they are contradicting the WHO and the PHO, but they said that they have to protect this situation as a Nation, and its capability of daling with the swine flue.In the other hand, Im only saying what's in the local News and Papers. ""I"" haven't said that the flights will be cancelled.But isn't is WEIRD that the School of Doctors and Nurses are demanding this???? The very same medical proffesionals???? It defenetelly fricks me out, and I live here..... "
I don't understand the reasoning. This new flu has MUCH milder effects than the regular flu which passes around the globe yearly. DR might as well shut it's doors shut permanently if they are that afraid.I can understand this reaction over a week ago when little was known about this disease but not now. It's pure foolishness.
"..and according to some news reports today, the ""flu"" is not as bad as ""they"" said it was going to be. (oops)"
"Well, this is LAST MINUTE NEWS.Is right now on the TV, and the paper just actualized:One ""supicious"" case of the flu at the airport, coming from New York on Jet Blue airline.www.listin.com.do/app/article.aspx?id=100225Everyone might be getting paranoyed? Maybe. But I preffer having all the information I can get...."
"Margdagio said:""I can understand this reaction over a week ago when little was known about this disease but not now. It's pure foolishness.""I say: Please don't forget that DR doesn't have the same capability, or economic solvency to deal with an epidemy like this, than lest say... Canada.....(If you saw just one public dominican hospital, which I hope you never do, you'd know what Im talking about.... )If a case enters the country without being noticed, and goes to lets say, boca chica....it would defenetelly be a disaster... "
"It seems that the Dominican Department of Health is not really considering cancelling flights from ""infected"" countries (USA, Canada, Spain, etc)...that's according to one of the Secretaries of Health who said that on a conference press..here is the link to that info. that appeared on one Dominican newspaper (it is in Spanish though!)I agree that DR should cancel flights to/from Mexico only...but not from the rest of the countries...those countries are the ones where most of the tourists going to DR come from..it would be very foolish to close the borders at this moment!!!!..especially when the flu seems to be almost ""under control""!!!!...and actually I am surprised that they are considering cancelling flights a little too late....actually DR should take advantage of this situation....and they should expect (and even encourage!!!) an influx of all those tourists who were supposed to go to Mexico at the beginning...and now DR could look like a great ""substitute"" for a cheap and affordable vacationHere is the link from the paper I mentioned:www.elcaribecdn.com/index.php…"
"Monica, I do understand your fear. Believe me.Influenza is a disease that's always around in various forms. Yes, it can be a killer and is not to be taken lightly. That's why the initial panic. However, this strain is not at all what authorities first feared. Yes, it is spreading but most of those who contract it are recovering VERY quickly on their own at home without need of medical intervention. There are only a few who have needed hospitalization and those people have had other serious medical problems beforehand. I would be amazed if H1N1 isn't already in DR. You would have had to close every airport in the country and close all shipping ports to keep it out. I hope all goes well for the Dominicans. Keep us up to date. Many folks outside your country care."
"Not ""my"" country...it certainly feel like it is though! ;)"
"""It seems that the Dominican Department of Health is not really considering cancelling flights from ""infected"" countries (USA, Canada, Spain, etc)...that's according to one of the Secretaries of Health who said that on a conference press..""Its not really up to him..... its not him who takes this kind of desitions, at least not in DR!.I can already see this tomorrow in congress again... Im paying special attention because its the actual DOCTORS and NURSES demanding this.... (sort of makes me think how would they work in the eventuality of cases over here...)"
"I read all three papers I think the last one is the most recent printed but not sure. I am traveling to DR from San Francisco in 3 weeks I hope by then all is resolved. But I do not as a healthcare provider the concerns of those people living in Dr. The health system is not what it is in the US. I want to go to DR really bad for my vacation but I also do not want to end up in one of their hospitals without adquate care. Help keep me posted Monica, you seem to be our best contact person."
"Thanks Monica, You do seem to be the best source of news on this subject. We're supposed to fly to Punta Cana in three days (Saturday) from New York.Keep us posted!"
"The original post was from over 1 week ago. If congress was going to cancel flights from affected countries (US, Canada, Spain, etc), wouldn't it have made sense to do it then, rather than 8 or 9 days later? I understand the concern, but with the LONG delay in taking action and the obvious negative consequences to the DR economy, does this have a realistic chance of happening? "
I certainly hpoe they do not. Am leaving in the morning!
"This is excatly what Im talking about:www.diariolibre.com/noticias_det.php…(traslate with babelfish)I did have my reasons to believe that over here there is a huge lack of both knowledge and resources to deal with an epidemy...but now even the local papers show the proof that local autorities don't even have a protocol to handle this sitations.Five hours they had that woman locked up in a room at the airport, separated from her 3 year old, befero noowe even though of calling an ambuance to take her to a clinic.... "
"Its funny that after the five hours they made her take the test, and then DISPACHED HER without even knowing the results (?????)"
"Also:""El avión que realiza el vuelo 819 de Jet-Blue regresó hacia territorio norteamericano cargado de nuevos pasajeros sin haberse tomado las medidas provisorias que están tomando organizaciones de salud en todo el mundo.De acuerdo a las autoridades aeroportuarias ese avión debió ser retenido por un tiempo hasta tanto fuera limpiado y fumigado sólo por sospecha, pero esas medidas fueron ignoradas por las autoridades de salud de puesto en el AILA.""Translation: The aircraft making the Jet Blue fligh 819 returned to North American territory filled up with new passengers, without having taken any of the previsory measures taken by health organisations throughout the world. In accordance with airport authorities , that plane should have been retained for a period long enough for the aircraft to be cleaned and fummigated, only for the suspition, but those measures were ignored by the health autorities at the Airport"" "
"People are switching to DR from Mexico because they both have a lot of all inclusives to choose from and prices are similar. Aruba, Bahamas, Bermuda, Turks and Caicos are all very expensive. A lot of the other islands don't have much in the way of all inclusives. My friend and I went to AAA travel agent yesterday, prices are outrageous at these other places. Travel agent also said not to many sales in DR either."
"So..... with all that has been said, Are the flights cancelled and /or when will we find out the true answer ?????"
"Shanigirl - Monica will probably (hopefully) post again with her regular updates.Thanks Monica for taking time out to keep all interested parties informed on this situation.It is very much appreciated - as are all your posts.Kindest regards, Leigh"
"Bravo, Mike! Well said."
"Here, here Mike..........this thread has caused quite a bit of miscommunication and unnecessary worry.....especially by myself....the news has calmed down quite a bit and I wish that this thread does too. Mike you absolutely make perfect sense for all of those who have common sense. If they cut off all flights fro countries who have one or more reported cases, quite of bit of other things get cut off too that this country needs to survive. So unless you can attach an article saying proof positive facts about ""exactly"" what the Dominican government is going to do, STOP POSTING HYSTERIA to get eveyone worried who is either going or thinking about going to the Dominican."
Does anybody have heard or read anything about the final decision of the Congress on this matter????I don't think they are going to cancel any flights by now...but anyway....are there any updates??...
"i did not hear a thing about such.and i guess at the same moment such decision would've been taken it would be spread out all over the whole worldwide press/CNN/aso, all those stuff channels who spread such panics about everything on the planet on daily bases to make a multimillion living out of oit like they do 24/7/365.the fact that nothing shows up nowhere means that my suspicious IMHO been right, just a piece of uneducated BS spreading panics over a lil travel bord like TA.if something like that would happen it will be on the big news and for sure within minutes somebody would post a link to that news or at least a 'rumor thread' about it right here right away.nothing happenedthe sun been shining all day long8:15PM the climate out on the veranda in front of the ;aptop is perfect,life is gooddon't bring it downMike"
