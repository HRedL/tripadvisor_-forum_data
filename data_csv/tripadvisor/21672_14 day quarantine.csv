Lettuce Entertain You just announced they will be enforcing the rule by asking each person as they enter the restaurant if they have traveled to any of the states listed. They will also be taking temperatures at the door. Hopefully more places follow.
"I have read that many places in Ireland are doing the same, Americans are flying there and totally ignoring their quarantine rule."
"If our COVID visitors don’t respect our rules, they should be turned away. It takes us to protect us. Good going Lettuce Entertain You."
This is just window dressing. People are most contagious about 24 hours before they have a fever. And do we really expect people who are flouting the quarantine order to tell the truth about their recent travels? I doubt it.
I appreciate the effort and if everything was like this less people would travel here.
"I am truly gobsmacked by the amount of people traveling, just from reading other forums."
"Ok, I can see why, but it’s kinda stupid. If someone is traveling and not quarantining, then they’ll lie. I don’t think they can demand ID unless you’re ordering alcohol. Regardless, many people live here with their old IDs anywaysEdited: 11:15 pm, July 23, 2020 "
"In Ireland I read that there are restaurants asking for documentation showing when you entered the country, like a boarding pass."
"Dale, given that businesses are being encouraged to obtain contact information for their customers for the purpose of Contact-tracing, I don't see why it would illegal to request an ID. Indeed, it is the socially responsible thing to do."
"""I am truly gobsmacked by the amount of people traveling, just from reading other forums.""The answer is, because we are 'Mericans! Nothing, not even a pandemic, can take away our freedom! (sarcasm)I read somewhere, that what's happening in the US is no surprise, since our country is pretty much designed to give states a lot of rights / authority. And because of that, you have a messy patchwork of restrictions between and within states.No real way to know, but I bet if we did a national lockdown in late March, enforcing masks, social distancing, etc...we'd have squashed the curve and this 4 million case bullsh!t would not have happened.I give this post maybe 4 hours before it is deleted.Edited: 7:58 pm, July 24, 2020 "
"Yes, the hodgepodge of restrictions makes things very difficult.I was discussing this with my neighbors in our socially-distanced backyard gathering tonight. God forbid people go through one summer without a 'big' vacation (when I was a kid we spent a week every summer at my aunt's cottage in Wonder Lake). People are losing their jobs right and left, and yet I read how Florida and the southeast are packed - the Smokies are packed - Arizona is packed - California beaches and mountains are packed - the national parks out west are packed. No wonder we can't get past this - in many European countries during their lockdowns you could barely go from one side of town to another."
And then there's Sweden.
"Yes, there's Sweden, with a far higher death rate than its neighbors, a robust health care system where everyone has health insurance, and a much more homogeneous population than the U.S.. Plus a health minister who admits he would do things differently if he had it to do over again.And the hodgepodge of regulations and approaches in this country is a result of the federal government abdicating its responsibility to set a national policy and instead leaving it up to each governor."
https:/…ampJousting poles help when trying to social distance. I wish we could just shut down travel nationally for a few weeks.
"We cancelled our Vegas trip scheduled for May and now we cancelled our fishing vacation for September. If going without vacations or going out to eat is the worst my family experiences from this pandemic, we will consider ourselves fortunate.Edited: 7:01 pm, July 26, 2020 "
"People who have spent more than 24 hours in Wisconsin will soon be required to self-quarantine for 14 days upon entering Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Monday. https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…"
"Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Tuesday added Wisconsin, Missouri, North Dakota and Nebraska to the city’s self-quarantine list. People entering the city from those states are asked to self-isolate for 14 days. There are now 22 states on the self-quarantine list. https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…"
Next week we can start saying which states are not on the list.
"The Federal Gov't has left it up to the individual States and Cities to handle Covid-19. The Federal Gov't has sent Federal Troops to police American citizens in States and Cities. The USA needs a Federal Covid-19 Mandate NOT a Federal policing mandate. I know, a political rant. Sorry, couldn't help myself."
"Let's hope Indiana doesn't get added to the list. While many are probably working from home, there must still be a lot of people traveling to downtown Chicago from Indiana for work.And s-s, I agree with you. I hope your rant doesn't get removed.CV"
https:/…Illinois now on New York’s quarantine list. People need to stop traveling and stay home!
"That's the least you can do. Measuring temperature, wearing a mask, and sanitizing are the least you can do."
Finally......Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers issues a statewide mask mandate amid a spike in coronavirus caseshttps://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…
That won't make them happy. Friends just moved up to Wisc last year. They couldn't believe they would be the only ones wearing masks at the stores. They haven't even gone to restaurants since March. Said the marinas and docks were packed for July 4. All that info from them made us cancel our trip. Didn't feel safe going up there.
"There are already sheriffs in WI saying they won't enforce the mask mandate because it is ""unconstitutional."" Unreal."
It's Wisconsin.
It’s amazing how all of a sudden all these law enforcement officials are concerned about the Constitution .......
It's not like CPD enforces it. Stores have to have someone at the door. That's the only enforcement in Chicago.
Stores aren’t enforcing it. I had this discussion at my local Walgreens a few weeks ago when out of four people in line I was the only masked customer. They have been told by corporate not to enforce it. As have other stores. And law enforcement has zero interest. So basically we are letting the anti-maskers control things. My point with law enforcement is that they’ve never been particularly concerned about their oaths to the Constitution before. Only now. And only about stuff related to Covid.
"Can you pick a new store? At my Walgreens I don’t think I’ve seen anyone in the store without a mask. Same at the Target, Whole Foods, and CVS or the Tonys finer foods. There’s lots of pharmacies around if yours is an issue. I’ve seen a lot of people outside not wearing masks but inside it’s been very good.The Whole Foods by me has guards at the entrance enforcing it."
"And the enforcers need to be paid, are we just adding that role to the already full plate the employees have? Perhaps the states should pay and post people at the door. I don’t blame the stores for not enforcing, some of the nuts get violent. Also, I’d much rather have the police solve real crime and not be on mask duty."
It's simple. If you don't have a mask you will not get sold anything.People will figure it out and not go.B.
"It's being enforced at every store I've been in in River North, West Loop, etc."
"Judy D, you are from Michigan. If I'm not mistaken, Rochester Hills is between Pontiac and Detroit, so how can you comment on mask wearing in Chicago. The stores themselves enforce mask wearing, and very well. Booya and msmejkal are correct: no shoes, no shirt, no mask = no service.Edited: 8:13 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"Judy, the last snip you made about Chicago’s quarantine was on another post on July 3. Something about manning our own borders. Chicagoans are telling the way it is here. In this pandemic, accept what is for us and deal with what is, or isn’t, for you."
"While Foods has been good. But Walgreens has been open about telling their associates not to confront anyone about the mask, not only did the personnel relate that to me ( and it was confirmed to my alderman) but it was mentioned in an article about how either Cicero or Berwyn ( I cant remember which) has cited them for failure to comply with the state mandate. And they aren’t alone frankly. In my local NextDoor group other people have posted examples. I stopped patronizing the smaller grocery I normally patronized because I felt they were a bit lax, I continually saw one of the butchers with his mask around the chin, and they weren’t sanitizing carts that I ever saw."
Puerto Rico gets added to the list = https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…
NYC just implemented check points for out of state people driving in to the city. They also publicly announced that fines could be as high as $10K for those that are required to quarantine but do not. We will see if Chicago follows suit.B.
That's great. We really need to do this. It's not fair to everyone here following the rules. WI bars look like it's 2019. No masks. Crowds. Bachelorette parties. Party busses. And then people bring it back to Chicago.
I read on their NY forum that someone reported that their hotel asked them questions about their residency and where they were traveling from.
