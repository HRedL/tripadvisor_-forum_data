I know that most holidays will be cancelled for the next while but just a heads up to anyone booked into a H10 hotel in April that they will not be opening until at least the 1st of May.
We are due to go the Salauris on the 5th May
H10 hotels have added an information page with info on cancellations and modifications in regards to covid-19: https://www.h10hotels.com/en/Covid19
