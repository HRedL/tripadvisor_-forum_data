"HiPlease accept my apologies if this is really obvious, but I've looked at maps and can't work out if Pigeon Forge / Smoky Mountains will be affected by this as I don't know what counts as 'east coast', we'll be here in mid June....Colossal numbers of cicadas - quietly growing underground since 1996 - are about to emerge along much of the US East Coast to begin an orgy of passionate singing and mating.Billions of so-called 17-year periodical cicadas, with their distinctive black bodies, buggy red eyes, and orange-veined wings will begin to settle along a roughly 900-mile stretch from northern Georgia to upstate New York.…sky.com/story/1087398/cicada-invasion-east-…ThanksSusan"
"Hi Susan,I live in the Nashville area, and the cicadas were here a couple if tears ago, so middle Tennessee is unaffected. I don't know about Gatlinburg. They are absolutely harmless, and ogs onder them a tasty, crunchy treat!"
"Hi Rayrat,Thanks for your reply, I've posted it in the Sevier County Forum now too.I'm definitely more on the 'yuck that's scary' side of beasties than the 'yum, tasty' side! :)ThanksSusan"
"The sound of a couple of them at night sitting on a porch swing {the listner, not the Cicadas) is really quite nostalgic and soothing. I'm not sure about an epidemic of them!"
