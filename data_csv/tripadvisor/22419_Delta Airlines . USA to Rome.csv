"This round trip reservation was made with Delta, No middle man. End of June travel for 2.5 weeks.One business class ticket and one coach main cabin.I have not read anything about Delta and how they are processing their confirmations and cancelations.There have no updates on our flights and we have not canceled yet... but plan to do so. Just watching and hoping to save the trip but have great doubts. Has anyone worked with Delta on this situation?Thank you."
Just look here. https:/…overview
"Thank you, but it says nothing about a refund. Since we are traveling the third week of June, Delta's guidelines have not been stated yet.I like others, prefer a refund. Who knows what next year will bring?"
"If you cancel, no refund. If you want a refund, you’ll need to wait. If Delta extends the current offer to May and June, you may be able to cancel and save your ticket value for 24 months. If they extend the offers. Your risk. They are obviously incentivizing customers canceling with some pretty generous terms. At this point, there is no incentive for them to cancel. In my opinion.If you want to track their announcements, go herehttps:/…delta-coronavirus-newsEdited: 7:01 pm, April 11, 2020 "
"Also read the FAQs in the link I sent you in #1. They include their refund policy if they cancel and even what they will do if you fail to cancel in time, for their current Covid19 offers."
"Hi,Given how fast conditions are changing, most airlines, like Delta, haven’t formalized and publicly announced/committed to their June flying just yet. I suspect that by either end of April or the first week of May, you’ll have some better clarity as to what are DLs plans for their Atlantic market flying. I just think right now - April 11th, given how many countries still have some form of entry limitations — and many of those rules have expiration dates in mid to late April or even end of month, everyone needs to wait and see what develops in that regard.Largely, one major factor that carriers will use to determine what they fly and how often they fly it, will be based on the entry ability of non-nationals to that foreign country. Along with that will obviously be the domestic (US) situation as most US carriers derive the substantial percentage of their passenger load from US origin.The one good thing is that airlines can’t just announce on a Friday that they’ll restart flying to somewhere on the follow Monday morning— as most carriers have a bulk of their fleet at non-hub locations for short-term storage- and that will take a few days to even weeks to bring it back online (to full revenue flying status certification) and position aircraft for a restart.Drawn downs are a bit easier as carriers can usually stop flying somewhere (internationally) with about 2 days notice (they usually have to arrange for the layover crew who would operate the fight back to base, to be repatriated) Travel Safe,"
Travel Safe to all. Thanks for your responses.
"We just canceled our flight with Delta a few days ago, they are now extending the time to use your credit until 2022. Giving you two years."
