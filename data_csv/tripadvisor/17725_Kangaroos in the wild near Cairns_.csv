"Hello guys,We are going to be in the Cairns area for a week (4 days with a car). We really would love to see some kangaroos out in the wild, not only in the zoo's. Where are our best chances to take a glimpse on them? We really would not like to miss this opportunity.Thanks and regards,Petrin"
What's your full itinerary again?Cairns isn't known for its kangaroo spotting opportunities so maybe there is a better location somewhere else on your trip?
"Best place to view kangaroos or wallabies is on the Cook Highway about 500 mtrs north of the Trinity Beach roundabout just past the bowls club. Best time is late afternoon when they graze otherwise you will be able to see them during the day lazing under the trees around the perimeter of the open areas. A word of caution, the Cook Highway can get very busy so make sure you park safely on the roadside."
"@Waddler, our full itinerary is:22-24 July: Brisbane24-27 July: Cairns27-30 July: Port Douglas30-31 July: Trinity Beach31 Jul - 06 Aug: SydneyWe are going to have a car from 27 till 31 July. Thats why I asked about a location around Cairns.When we are in Sydney, one day we are going to Blue Mountains, but with train. Do you think there we can catch some? We don't have this flexibility with the train as with the car in Cairns and Port Douglas.@LizzyJitney, thanks for the suggestion. Will try that. Do we have better odds somewhere around Mossman and the Daintree ?"
You can see 'wild' wallabies at Granite Gorge near Mareeba.tablelands.org/tablelands/â€¦Daintree river for crocodiles (or even just outside Port Douglas on creeks).Edited: 5 years ago 
Granite Gorge near Mareeba has rock wallabies which you can feed by hand. The Mareeba Gold Course often has the odd kangaroo lazing on the green. The best time to see Kangaroos is near dawn or dusk.
"I agree with LizzyJitney. There are ""what seems like hundreds"" of roos/wallabies in an open field near the Bowls club. They are also there early morning."
"Wallabies, well like little kangaroos are all over the place. Trinity Park and also White Rock Griffin Road have epidemics.For the real big kangaroos go west to the dry tropics starting from Mareeba and be there sunrise, Try the golf club."
"In Brisbane there is a place called Lone Pine Sanctuary that has MANY kangaroos of all types (including the very large ones - Red or Grey I think, much larger than wallabies). While they aren't ""in the wild"" I don't consider it a zoo - at least not like a typical American zoo. The kangaroos are in a very large fenced in field, and you can go in and just roam around with them and feed and pet them. I even laid down in the grass with them and rested my head on one while they were lazily sunning themselves. My friend/host from Brisbane doesn't think highly of the place, but I thought the animals all seemed well cared for and happy (while the koalas probably don't enjoy the constant photo sessions with people actually holding them, they looked very healthy and fat). Aussies who have countless opportunities to see Australian wildlife will probably shudder at the thought of my recommending this place, but for an American this was an incredible experience to see all of the wildlife in one place and so up close (the wombats were my favorite)"
"Hi,Any outer urban Sydney Golf Course.Cheers,"
"SnowboardSurfboard what I do shudder at is how lucky you were not to get hit, scratched or otherwise injured by the kangaroo for lying down on it! Amazing! *rolls eyes!*"
I'm the roo whisperer :)
i will be in Cairns in August and i'd be also interested in seeing wild Kangaroos.Could you please point me out this open field on a map? i can not find it on google.thanks so much

"You'll find mobs of wild wallabies near Smithfield regional park, north of Cairns"
"can agree with mavy2 , counted 30 grazing while passing through trinity park last year around dusk"

"Lizz, you are exactly right. Have just passed thru the area with our American friends. Seems like hundreds of Roos. We carefully parked and our friends took some great photos."
"There are a number of wallabies on Mt Whitfield, near the walking tracks. You can see them even from the heavily walked Red track and I see them every time on the Blue track."
