"And how would you rate Penang’s main hospital?I was planning South and Central America for my next travel wander, but it’s looking increasingly not a great idea to be bouncing around about 8 different countries in a 6 month spanSo I think I’ll go back to my favourite place in all of South East Asia and just live in one place for a few months - the amazing GeorgetownI see that Malaysia has 129 cases so far, but can’t find data on Penang specificallyQuestions;- Is there information on the amount of Penang cases yet?- how stringent are the checks at Penang airport for people coming in?- how good is the Penang hospital if I do catch it on the island? I’ll have pretty good travel insurance Thanks"
