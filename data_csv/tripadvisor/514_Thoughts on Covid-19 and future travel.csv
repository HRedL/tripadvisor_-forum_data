"Another poster just asked a question about when others feel would be a good time to rebook travel. One option for them was October, which they noted was during hurricane season and the other was the end of December which is “busier.” I hate to be a Debbie downer but I have a couple of thought that I just want to throw out there. I’m sure many of us, myself included, are wondering about future travel. October is still hurricane season and the end of December is busier for sure but what about throwing the pandemic into the mix? How does everyone feel it is going to play into future travel? These are my questions, disregarding hurricane season and December crowds...1. Is Corona going to continue to fizzle until it’s run it’s course, hopefully not making a resurgence before a vaccine becomes available?2. Will it “be under control” by the fall enough for travel? By December? 3. Will it be under control, by say, the end of summer and then resurge (like flu season) when next winter approaches?These are the questions I have that I know are not able to be answered without the use of a crystal ball because this is just so unprecedented. What are your personal thoughts (no judgements, there are no right or wrong answers that we know of yet)"
"I am thinking that air travel will be risky until a vaccine is developed , especially for people in high risk groups like over 60:which is me. I hope that I am wrong but I think travel l will not be safe until late 2021 or 2022 given past time frames for developing a vaccine. Maybe with what appears to be so many government and private sector scientists working on vaccine the time frame will be shorter."
"Good thread topic! As I sit here in my backyard instead of the VI’s this week, I have been wondering not so much about when we can return, but under what circumstances we might feel comfortable enough to return. My husband says he’s not going anywhere until there’s a vaccine, so there’s that.But as the planner in my family, I’ve been wondering about booking logistics. Most lodging on STJ requires a significant down payment up front and then, on paper at least, very unforgiving cancellation policies. I know many companies and villa owners have been more accommodating in practice, but that is at the discretion of the owner or company and not per the contract. How do I book my next trip with confidence that I won’t lose my money because I’ve contracted the virus, or the islands have shut down because of a resurgence of the virus?More importantly, how can I know I’m not unwittingly bringing the virus to the island or just as unknowingly bringing it home from the island?I bring these concerns forward not to unload my anxiety on the forum but to openly share my hesitation around booking my next trip. I’m still employed, I’m still willing and able to visit. I supported the island in the wake of Irmaria and I’m chomping at the bit to do the same agin. Bur I just don’t know when I can pull the trigger on our next trip without personal and financial risk."
"<< “ I am thinking that air travel will be risky until a vaccine is developed” >>It is interesting that most people are operating under the assumption that development of a safe and effective vaccine to be “a given” and the only question is “When will we have it?”There are a great many viruses that have defied development of any sort of vaccine for years. I’ve not seen any statements or information from any experts to indicate that coming up with one in this case is a foregone conclusion.Edited: 3:47 pm, April 19, 2020 "
Interesting comments from everyone and the funny thing is that just about every comment and/or concern mentioned I have had myself.
"fromaway,..that is a good point to bring up, especially since STJ is sort of unique in that a lot of bookings are done privately with owners. This thought might also transfer to them so they can rethink their policies as well so people aren't afraid to book with them...they don't want to lose money either.I wouldn't hold my breath or base anything on a vaccine being available. People seem to think that is the golden ticket. The flu vaccine has very low efficacy for a vaccine. This year is only ~ 45% and last year was 20%. CDC estimates 39-56 million flu infections this year and that is with a vaccine. Gigi, I pray it fizzles and runs its course and disappears like SARS, but like you said, that crystal ball would be nice:)"
"In February we booked our next 2 week return to St John for this coming December. I'm glad it is 7+ months away, and certainly hope things are better enough that we would travel then, and not risk neither our health nor that of St John. I guess in November we will need to make the call (30 days out) as to whether to pay Gallows Point in full (non-refundable) or cancel."
"The issue with a Covid-19 vaccine is there has never been a vaccine developed for a coronavirus. It’s odd that this fact is only noted behind the main scenes.What we must prepare for is when restrictions are lifted people will travel. It will less than before and folks will take some “token” measures to prevent attracting or spreading COVID-19, but they will come."
"It's all about testing!. Understanding who has been infected and who is infected, is paramount to any travel. Acquired immunity is a very important thing to understand and the only way we can ""safely"", move around. As Snorkeler says, vaccines are never 100% effective. Wash your hands and cover your coughs and don't rub your face!"
"This has been top of mind as I contemplate booking travel for a visit next March. Personally, I envision the US evolving to a philosophy in which we each are responsible for our own wellbeing. One in which those who are healthy, have developed immunity, or are simply more comfortable taking risks begin traveling sooner than those who are more susceptible. A sort of ""risk tolerance divide"" if you will. I'm not advocating that; I'm just prognosticating based on what we're seeing after roughly four weeks of government imposed restrictions. If my prediction is correct, I think you'll see a gradual return of visitors to STJ as opposed to a sudden opening of the flood gates. Perhaps I'm overly influenced by the media, but it seems like more and more people are beginning to question whether the benefit of all these mitigation efforts are truly worth the inconvenience and economic hardship."
"<< ""One in which those who... are simply more comfortable taking risks begin traveling sooner than those who are more susceptible."" >>How does one reconcile the reality that travel by those who are ""more comfortable taking risks"" will invariably expose ""those who are more susceptible"" to those same risks?As the old expression goes, one man's right to swing his arm ends at the tip of the next guy's nose."
"At what point will these points being made about COVID 19 be applied to the flu. Those susceptible to the flu are the same as those susceptible to COVID 19. Originally all the lock downs were to make sure that out hospitals can handle the outbreak. Thankfully, so far they have. As we see the number of infections decrease, when are the restrictions lifted? When do we treat this like any other risk in life. I personally do not think it means waiting for a vaccine or zero cases."
"Cine and lovecruzbay...100%David, did you see the very small random study of 200 people tested for antibodies… 30% tested positive. Washing your hands and not touching your face it’s probably 80% of prevention and based on all the people I see in the store attempting to wear masks, they are doing themselves a great harm."
@snorkeler-6 - I actually don't normally have a problem with the villa owner's policies but that was when I could purchase trip insurance. But now I can't necessarily get insurance for a trip that's cancelled or interrupted by coronavirus.
"I don't have a problem with the closing of schools and other ""non-essential"" businesses for the time being. I feel it was needed to slow the roll, so to speak. I'd like to know that if I needed a ventilator one might be available. On one side of the spectrum you have the ""f-it, I'll just get it and get it over with mentality"" and on the other hand you have those who you couldn't drag out of their houses with a bulldozer. I think that those 2 groups will continue to act in that mindset when the restrictions are lifted. I also agree that people will trickle back to normalcy, rather than a big surge, with travel and probably in most every other social happening.As far as future villa bookings, it would be nice if the villa owners would work with us. The place I had booked for next week was great to deal with.Edited: 7:17 pm, April 19, 2020 "
"This topic is on so many of our collective minds. IMHO, the dates of open travel will come in waves that track inevitable resurgence of outbreaks as restrictions are lifted. I find it likely that there will be a 'window ' beginning around 9/15-11/15, with a strong possibility that a secondary/seasonal resurgence will close travel down again for a period of time. This is the tough push/pull of economy vs. public health that the US will navigate until there is a vaccine. However, it also seems likely that the morbidity factor of Covid-19 will be greatly be reduced w/in 3-4 months via a combination therapy of already-available products, which should include anti-viral (Remdesivir and others) in combination (or not) with a potent immunomodulator/anti-inflammatory (Actmera and the like). This should allow for *some* relaxation of travel restrictions, provided that STJ and the USVI is general have access to enough of the above pharma agents to handle on-island outbreak 'worst case' scenarios. Targeted therapies like the above *should* relegate C19 to a sub- .3% morality rate and thus place the risk north of flu, but well south of current assumed rates. The markets are already pricing this in. The again, we do not know the denominator! My personal belief is that major community exposure began in the US in late December and the antibody prevalence, once accurate testing begins over the summer (fingers crossed), will show upwards of 20%-30%, depending on region. If Covid-19 antibodies offer immuno-protection for similar duration to SARS-Cov-1 and MERS, then we are looking at 6 months (min) to 2+ years. So for us- we are thinking an August trip would be 95% unlikely; a November trip, 50/50, and next April about 75% likely to be OK. Novmeber maybe better than that. Hoping for the best health for everyone!"
I actually posted the oct/dec thread while also knowing it might be a complete pipe dream. More than likely I’m just going to ask the villa owner to push our reservation to next summer just so I don’t have to worry about it anymore.
"Snork, I did not see the study. I agree. We are human and on average we touch our faces 20-25 times an hour. Are you saying, out of 200 people randomly tested, 30% were positive? My greatest concern, is being a vector, not necessarily catching it."
"Snork, sorry just read your post again. 30% doesn’t surprise me. Many asymptotic cases."
"They did a random antibody test in Chelsea, MA of 100 people and 30 tested positive for antibodies. The Federal government needs to assist the states so they can do mass testing. It is the only way they will be able to start opening without having to close down again which would be an even bigger disaster."
"Stanford did the same in the Bay Area with the same results, estimating that the infected rate is 50-80 times the published numbers. The death rate then is greatly inflated as well. Depending on how you weight the results- .15% to .35% is the actual death rate. https://paloaltoonline.com/news/2020/04/17/s…"
"A virus as contagious as this one certainly won't ""fizzle out"" or whatever. That's not going to happen, it just won't. SARS was far less contagious, and had a different latency time as well. Different animals all together. As soon as restrictions are eased, cases will spike again. You can count on that. We're already seeing it in countries that are pulling back on their lock downs. I don't understand why anyone continues to think the US will be any different. It wasn't when it started, and it won't be now. I read a study that came out of Harvard about a week ago, which was pretty sobering. They're predicting some form of social distancing being required into 2022, and that's assuming we get a workable vaccine by next summer, which is not at all assured. Certain people with big microphones have done major damage to how we handled (and continue to handle) this crisis. Lies, manipulating data, more lies, gaslighting, and so on. And all for purely selfish ends. It's shameful."
We have no idea how many people have been infected because we did not do adequate testing and still are not doing it. We had plenty of time to prepare for this and get supplies and we still are not doing it. The federal government needs to get their act together soon and get the testing supplies to the states and territories. Pretty simple. I don't know why anyone thinks the government will be able to get a vaccine to the public any better than they have gotten the testing out.
The governor announced today that reservation prohibition will be extended until May 15
"<< ""At what point will these points being made about COVID 19 be applied to the flu."" >>Not sure why people are still suggesting that this an apt comparison.I might be off a bit, but I believe that Covid 19 has killed more Americans in the past TWENTY DAYS as the flu kills on average in an ENTIRE YEAR. In a month or so it's come out of nowhere to become #1 cause of death in the US... beating out cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, accidents, suicide... and everything else.The typical person infected with the flu only infects 1.3 other people. That number is 2.5 people for Covid 19. (It spreads geometrically faster and further.)This is partly because the flu has a contagious incubation phase prior to symptoms appearing of only 1-4 days, vs 5-15 days for Covid 19; flu victims know they are sick and stay home and people stay away from them. Covid 19 people continue to be in the community. (Never mind the current feeling that there's 10-30x as many people who spread without ever having symptoms.)Fewer than 2% of flu patients are hospitalized. Covid 19 is upwards of 20%There's a vaccine for the flu, which while not 100% effective is pretty good.There are treatments for the flu, which again aren't great but they are reasonably effective."
"If my husband and I are well , our flight and villa open, then we will keep our fall trip. We will where masks, bring disinfectant wipes for all the various pit stops along the way etc.... We work from home, are not particularly social lol and plan in continuing the distancing till this is done even if they ""open"" our state. We are in a high risk age group in a hot spot. So being very vigilant. Also would not want to risk bringing the virus to the VI."
"RJP, you are more than ""a bit off"". You are throwing numbers out there with none rooted in reality. You said more people have died of COVID-19 in the past 20 day than the flu kills in a YEAR. To date, COVID 19 has killed about 40,000 people since JANUARY. That's 95 days. A MILD flu year is 40,000 deaths. A bad flu year is 80,000 deaths. Secondly, you said COVID19 is the ""#1 cause of death in the US... beating out cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, accidents, suicide... and everything else.""

Accordingly, 40,000 deaths from COVID 19 to date is in fact more than the average number of deaths from flu each year.And since you've forced me to double check my sources and math, the first US death was on Feb 29, and we passed 37,000 about the end of last week. So if you start from ""Death #1"" it actually took COVID 19 almost 50 days to kill as many people as the flu kills in an average year.However, as the virus has gained steam it's more important to look retrospectively. There are 40,000 deaths currently and there were roughly 3,000 deaths from the first on Feb 29 to March 31. The difference being 37,000 deaths in the month of April. Today is April 20th. I'll save you the calculator work again: over the course of the last 20 days, COVID-19 has killed roughly as many people as the flu does in an average year.All that being said, If you want to argue fine-grain difference between whether it took COVID-19 fifty days or twenty days to kill more people than the flu does in an average year, or engage in semantics of whether it's merely the #1 killer in the US ""currently"" rather than annually... you're really missing the bigger picture.

If we want conflicting opinions we can watch Fox news for a half an then CNN for a half an hour. I’m just hoping I can get there August 9 for my trip.
"RJP, in addition, approx 1/3 of Covid deaths in NY were never actually tested for the disease. Who knows how many other across the country were called covid deaths that weren’t? Additionally, anyone who dies with covid and not from covid is considered a covid death.The other stuff, you were off on. Susan summed it up well."
My sister was telling me she read about this person who contracted Covid and was over the proverbial hump and seemingly well on the road to recovery. They started coughing and ended up having a heart attack and died. So did they die from Covid or did they randomly succumb to a heart attack that they would have inevitably had? I try not to read the sensationalized stories the papers print. They only cause more hysteria. What good is knowing that going to do for anyone? Tell me what is being done to help people live. Keep encouraging people to wash hand and social distance and anything else actually being done to get this under control.
"This is what you said. "" In a month or so it's come out of nowhere to become #1 cause of death in the US... beating out cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, accidents, suicide... and everything else.""You are 100% wrong about that. Cancer kills 600,000 a year. That's an average of 1,644 a day. COVID ""on paper"" has killed 42,000 since the first case was diagnosed in January. That's about 466 a day. That's not even close to other killers. Also, the 42,000 deaths is way off as they are over-counter. Per Dr. Birx, we are counting deaths of people who died WITH COVID as having died OF COVID. No other country is counting that way. If you go to the ER and drop dead of a heart attack - even without testing, if you showed any cold symptoms, your death is counted as a COVID death."
"As mentioned, if you want to dicker over the semantics of whether I was clear enough that that I meant ""currently"" vs ""annually"" you're not looking at the big picture.Edited: 11:39 am, April 21, 2020 "
Whether one believes Covid19 deaths are over counted or under counted seems to link rather directly to political preferences. I'll accept the numbers as stated because those compiling the figures are at least somewhat more objective.
"Susan, unfortunately the last item on your list will jump significantly if we remain locked down for reasons beyond the original purpose. Remember, “we have to flatten the curve” now we are getting to a level of fear driving suggestions. If some of the assumptions of 10x to 30x more infected is correct, then the fatality rate is also also 10x to 30x lower from the virus. What is the purpose of locking down into June? Why not September, why not into 2021. When will we be safe enough?Edited: 6:57 pm, April 21, 2020 "

And of course the ""466 a day"" is also very misleading since the current 45,000 US deaths have all occurred in the last 53 days.""we are counting deaths of people who died WITH COVID as having died OF COVID.""Then why did write so much about how many people die WITH cancer? It's the other things that happen while you've got cancer that kill you.For anyone who hasn't figured it out yet, the flu has been around for a very long time, and it's always present. Those 37,400 average annual US deaths don't result from one single person getting the flu and then passing it along to others. It's the result of a large reservoir that's always present and periodically flares up. Unlike the flu COVID-19 is new disease that we hadn't encountered at all 4 month ago. To the best of our knowledge it went from zero human cases in the entire world to more than 2.5 million confirmed cases worldwide. In the US it's gone from killing 48 people in 2 weeks to killing at least 48 people per hour every day of the last 3 weeks."
"I missed this discussion yesterday, but many of our thoughts have already been discussed here. We have our annual December trip planned and partly paid for, but we've prepared ourselves with he thought that we will stay home/local until we have widespread testing and effective treatment available, if not a vaccine (which seems unlikely). We feel it would be irresponsible to potentially carry this virus from Chicago to St John. There will be another year for a vacation. Stay healthy everyone."
It is all a guess sat this point...I canceled a trip to South Africa for August. Who knows hat will happen after this. Good Luck
"LoveCruzBay, exactly! I agree with you 100%. And disagree with SteveNY. The death rate does not go back on 53 days to the first death. It does back to the day of the 1st diagnosis . 466 a day will not continue for an entire year because this is a VIRUS and all viruses retract during Summer months. ALL of them.This ""cure"" of this virus - i.e. the lock downs and the shuttering of the economy is going to kill FAR more people than the virus. 2nd and 3rd world nations that rely on the rest of the world via tourism will starve. Dominican Republic and Haiti with no cruise ships and no functioning government to provide relief - they will starve. African communities that were supported by wildlife toursim will not only begin to starve, but will be killing endangerd animals in masse to survive. Poaching of elephants, rhinos, without tourist1supported anti-poaching rangers will rise. This is about so much MORE than just the USA. All of the poverty stricken areas where our Peace Corps and other volunteer groups were administring vaccines - the Peace Corps and volunteer organizations were brought home. Those communities are now having measles and other outbreaks. Many will die. Dr.s Without Borders have been brought home. Tourism supports the very poorest areas of the world. Peace Corps, Dr. Without Borders and hundreds of other organizations that provided life-saving support are no longer there. This is beyond the 42,000 who have died in America. The true death rate of COVID-19 is less than 1% in 1st world countries. The death rate of shutting down the world will be far higher.Edited: 11:37 am, April 22, 2020 "
"Susan, you summed it up very well. I have been trying to impress the effects of poverty upon my friends, but some don't seem to get it. Tunnel vision is an awful thing. I was only talking about the consequences of poverty in this country too: poor folks won't seek preventative care, can't afford meds for simple conditions, don't eat well and are malnourished which affects immunity and healing, chronic health conditions snowball and lead to death. Kids don't get immunized and diseases we only read about in books (or see in Africa) become prevalent. People just don't get it. You summed it up on a global scale very well. I am happy that our mission in Haiti is still being supported. We (our church) started it about 30 years ago and have thousands of kids now that we take care of."
"My daughter is a Dr. Another subset of deaths as a result of shutting down this country is people who are waiting longer to seek medical help for OTHER fatal conditions are now dying when they could have been saved. Heart attacks, strokes, broken hips - which leads to pneumonia. Elective surgeries that have been cancelled were not mostly cosmetic. Many were joint replacements, heart stints, heart surgery, hernias, colonoscopies, transplants. She had 6 burst appendixes last week. They almost never see burst appendixes but people are waiting too long to go to the hospital now. Some of them will die from infection. Deaths starvation and diseases in poor nations now that humanitarian missions have been shut down will be far higher than COVID deaths."
"StevefromNYC - https://www.yahoo.com/news/2-died-coronaviru…They are now discovering that people have died from COVID far earlier than known. The Santa Clara study showed that of 200 people tested, 65% had antibodies, which means this has been around far longer and many have already had it - which makes the death rate FAR lower. There are 5 billion poor people in the world who are at danger of dying from starvation and disease from the worldwide economic shutdown."
"It is a poor choice to make potential 'life & death' decisions based on anecdote and speculation. Until there is adequate and accurate serum testing thought the US, there simply are not enough data on which to predicate policies that will literally cost or save lives. Everyone wants this to be over. There is a way to 'open back up' in a scaled, cautious manner that will allow for travel and tourism in due course. But- this cannot happen without ubiquitous testing and data collection driving the process. Who can argue that?"
"Can anyone explain to be what testing will do? I can get tested today and it could come back negative. In the meantime, I get coughed on and contract it tomorrow as I'm getting on a plane. My negative test today is meaningless tomorrow. Educate me."
"I guess the issue I have with the whole ""the cure is worse than the disease"" argument is that the ""future potential deaths from poverty"" are purely hypothetical at this point.Nobel Prize winning economists from Harvard, Wharton, MIT, Princeton, Columbia, etc can't agree on how to quantify the economic impact of the pandemic in general. So trying to project that economic impact into a number of deaths is an ""angels on the head of a pin"" exercise.But the number of deaths from the virus? Well, the deaths from the virus aren't hypothetical. They are actual. Given the ability to count body bags, quantifying those deaths is pretty easy to do.Ultimately we can potentially address someone becoming ""poor"" tomorrow... unless they end up becoming ""dead"" today."
"<< ""My negative test today is meaningless tomorrow. Educate me."" >>It really depends on exactly WHICH test you're talking about:Infection test: if not infected now (negative result) you could still become infected tomorrow, as you suggestAntibody test: if antibodies present (positive result) you have been previously infected/exposed and are now (presumably) immune and (presumably) cannot become infected tomorrow. (Further assumes you are not symptomatic/infected currently.)"
"The ignorance of a few on here is stunning to me. Keep up the good fight, RJP, I've lost the will to argue against the hordes of misinformed people. I will say this; susan, you are clearly arguing in bad faith. You're doing exactly what you originally accused RJP of doing (which he was not). He was giving worldwide numbers at first, then you come back trying to us US only on one side of your ""argument"", and world numbers on the other side. It's incredibly disingenuous, and is only harming the efforts to get this thing under control. Intellectual honesty matters. A lot. Intellectual curiosity matters a lot as well, and is so lacking today it makes me angry. Nobody should rely on Fox ""News"" for anything other than stoking their inherent biases. That's their entire modus operandi. Now they're having to back track on their content to avoid losing massive lawsuits over misleading the public about the dangers of Covid-19.

As to post 46; Had the topic of testing, the importance thereof, and exactly how to get to the point of opening hadn't been discussed thoroughly then I might be able to buy your explanation of their post. But combined with the other bad faith arguments made, the conclusion seems clear to me. FTR; I have historically voted conservative. Just not this time."
"Susan, I understand your question. Although early in the cycle of understanding, it is highly likely that the presence of serum antibodies (antibody test) would indicate some level of protection from further infection, and thus, stop any spread (""R0"") from individuals who show serum presence of antibodies. (Fingers crossed).  If SARS-COV-2 follows the immunity profile and protective duration of it's evil cousins MERS and SARS-COV, then (again, likely- not guaranteed) one *could* feel relatively secure in being safe from reinfection for 6 months-2 years+. Sadly, nobody knows the answer to this, but the research is trending in a + direction. Personally, I believe I had C19 in Feb (4+ weeks of extreme flu like symptoms and more...very healthy, 48 years old...rarely sick and this was the sickest I have been as an adult...wife had it as well, 6+ weeks!). I am getting an antibody test on Monday and am sure how I will use the data. Regarding travel- I stand by serum antibody testing and test/trace on a profound level as being needed to protect the overall health of our world citizens, especially until we have proven treatments and a vaccine. Cheers..."
"TimmaayThe “shutdown” had a purpose: to prevent the overwhelming collapse of our hospitals. Other than NYC and maybe a very few spots, it never happened. The vast majority of hospitals have essentially no business and are struggling, so the goal was overwhelmingly met. The number of cases does not matter, only the number of hospitalizations does. The number of deaths does not matter (yes it does, but not in the calculus of reopening), especially now that they daily keep adding untested people to the death tally, artificially increasing the death toll...yet I don’t see them adding the reciprocal 100’s of thousands of positive cases that we would need to create those additional deaths, thus also artificially increasing mortality. What would be the reason we are doing this? We met our goal, need to reopen, and if folks want to still shelter in place, they are more than welcome to continue. Nobody wants to force people that are not ready to move on to leave their homes, but everyone elses’ liberties need to be honored."
"I mean, those are all opinions, and you are certainly entitled to them snorkeler. I disagree with some, and agree with others. Yes, the shut down was to prevent over loading the health system. It did happen here in the Detroit metro area. But the fact that it didn't happen in most areas meant that our approach largely worked. Had it started sooner, we may not be in the spot we are today, but that's another topic. The thing I disagree with the most is your premise that ""we"" need to do this or that. Those are opinions, and I think you're mostly very wrong, respectfully. We are today seeing new surges in China, Germany, and others who are opening back up. I don't think it's for ""you"" to decide what is acceptable risk, and what is not. None of us know how this will play out, all we can do is wait, and do our part to be responsible members of a society. Nobody is living in a vacuum, your actions affect others and so on. Seems to me that by this point we would mostly all be on the same page. For some reason... we are not. Why is that?"
"""We met our goal, need to reopen, and if folks want to still shelter in place, they are more than welcome to continue. Nobody wants to force people that are not ready to move on to leave their homes, but everyone elses’ liberties need to be honored.""That's fine - you can push for what you want in your own home state but US Virgin Islanders are in a fragile high-tourist situation and do NOT want to welcome you back here until WE are completely ready."
Sttres...yes!
"TIMMMAY, what was the purpose for the shut down initially? What is it now? What is the point that a state should reopen? Since you only deal in facts and everyone else is dealing in opinion. I need to know what the facts are."
"""Can anyone explain to be what testing will do?""Lots of people can. If you don't know you either haven't bothered looking or you've only looked in the wrong places. Your post makes it pretty clear that any information you've looked at is either lacking or incorrect. If you educate yourself perhaps you'll believe what you learn.""The ignorance of a few on here""If only is was just ""on here"".""I guess the issue I have with the whole ""the cure is worse than the disease"" argument is that the ""future potential deaths from poverty"" are purely hypothetical at this point.""For those who are smart enough to actually think about it, we don't need to rely on hypotheses (though a lot of the thought on the subject falls far short of that) for either side of the argument. As near as I can tell extremely few of the ""cure is worse than the disease"" crowd have managed the enormous intellectual leap to consider the economic costs of ""saving"" the economy by letting a pandemic go unchecked. I know it sounds wildly surprising, but we've had pandemics before and there's actually real information out there because other people have already looked into it."
"thesteve, the tolls of poverty on human life are also well-researched and documented. As you said, we have had and will always have pandemics; none responded to the way we have here."
"The thing is, we aren't acting in a vacuum here. You seem to be inferring that there is some nefarious motive to shutting down our entire country. The rest of the world is shut down as well. There have been pandemics, but this is the first time the world has the ability to act in concert, in real time, to manage one. Nobody wants to destroy their own economy.Edited: 8:45 pm, April 24, 2020 "
"Something we probably all can agree on is that COVID 19 is highly infectious. And something else we can probably all agree on is that it can be a very bad illness for some who have contracted it and sometimes deadly. I think one of my main thoughts about all of this is that we may need to change some things going forward just to protect our fellow humans. So hopefully we all take the attitude ""we' attitude....we need to protect each other. So washing your hands, wearing a face mask, not traveling in times of high infection. I for one would feel horrible if I was the person who unknowingly spread the virus to someone who ended up getting very ill or dying. I think that travel, in general, is going to look different for quite a while. As a resident, this is the second time in a few years that I have learned that we really need to diversify our economy. If we continue to rely so heavily on tourism we will continue to struggle. And with a pandemic like this, of course I worry about our already fragile healthcare system and lack of individual health insurance. I hope everyone stays safe and does what they can to make sure we all stay as safe as possible as a whole."
"I absolutely agree, well said."
Well written Post 62Stay safe
"Julie, you wrote a very thoughtful post. It made me think about the other day when my husband said “I wish we could close the bridges and keep all the people off who don’t live here until this thing is over”. We live on an island, that I don’t really think of as such because it is really just a suburb of Buffalo. But it’s only accessible by bridges, and it’s surrounded by water, so an island it is. If we could lock all the “outsiders” off, we would. Everyone wants to feel safe in their home. If I lived on St John I would be saying stay away to visitors at this time. That and social distancing is the way to slow it down. Here in Western NY the counties/areas that are “farming” areas have way less cases than the others. They are social distanced just by the shear distances of their houses. It would be scary at this time to live somewhere without large hospitals like we have here. I’m ok that my trip got cancelled. Stay safe!"
"Yes, Julie... I keep saying that I hope if anything comes out of this, it is that people learn how to wash their hands and stay home when they are sick, this will benefit us immensely with other pandemics like the flu that come every single year.It has really made the general populace aware of infection control measures and that’s a good thing!"
"Thanks Julie..... be well, stay safe.... I'm hoping we will be able to keep our reservations and return for 2 weeks again this December."
Airline passengers being tested for Covid 19 at airport check in.https://www.businessinsider.com/emirates-tes…
"<< ""Airline passengers being tested for Covid 19 at airport check in."" >>Two things about the Emirates “publicity stunt” I read in another, more detailed article...FIRST: the test used for the Emirates flight was an antibody test, not a viral load test, so while it could tell if a passenger was previously exposed to the virus by detecting antibodies... it couldn’t detect if a person was currently infected and contagious. An infectious disease expert dismissed the idea, observing that every person tested and “cleared” to board the flight could have been currently contagious and the test that was administered wouldn’t know.SECOND: there was a suggestion that there were only a dozen or so passengers actually on the flight. So the ability to screen a handful of people on a single flight is relatively meaningless compared to the ultimate need to screen 250 or more passengers on thousands of full aircraft every day.Edited: 5:13 pm, April 27, 2020 "
"aztraveler, thanks for the detailed and informative report."
FROMAWAY...My feelings exactly.
My husband and I are not concerned with air travel. We will have our masks on for the full flight. We are over 60 but with no health concerns. Summer is low season so the beaches are never crowded. Go and enjoy!
"You realize, Ronald M, that unless you're wearing n-95 (or better) masks, and goggles, that you are yourself still unprotected? You should certainly be concerned about air travel, everyone should. Standard surgical masks largely work, if everyone uses them, but still are not full-proof against covid-19. If everyone were wearing n-95 or better, then it would be much safer. But that isn't possible, because there aren't enough of them for the public at large. A lot of folks seem to be misled, or are themselves intentionally misleading others. It's so frustrating to watch. We could have had this thing largely under control by now, but people can't even agree on basic science now. It's very sad, to say the least.Edited: 1:17 pm, July 06, 2020 "
"Oh lord...putting a small patch of tee-shirt material over your face does nothing. There is NO science behind that. In fact, the science disputes it. The COVID virus is .1 microns in size. The pore size of most cloth face masks is between 20 and 100 microns - which makes wearing the akin to putting up a chain link fence to stop mosquitos."
"The territory opened back up June 1st. Thousands of people have come to visit with only three tourists being positive for covid and none getting off the plane with temperatures. There is currently only one person in the hospital in st croix. Zero on st Thomas. So far, the fear of a surge of cases from tourists is completely unfounded."
Posting a quick follow up to my April comments about rebooking. I caved and optimistically booked a trip during Christmas break. We are flying Delta with no penalty for changing our flights for over a year out. Our villa owner has offered to reschedule if we are unable to travel. I made these plans though while the case counts were staying low and flat. I'll have to re-evaluate how things are going as the date gets closer of course.
"Thanks for the great report!I'm arriving on Monday 8.10 to STJ, also through SanJuan coming from NYC, and I am apprehensive about any roadblocks. How was your experience in PR? I have a connection there from JFK/SJU-STT. Cheers!"
"Masks are quite effective in reducing spread of respiratory viruses from an infected individual to the environment and, subsequently, to other people because viruses are not shed ""naked"", but only in droplets and aerosols. Reducing the risk of breathing in other people's virus-laden droplets is more difficult and requires a snug fitting mask where air only goes through the mask, not around it. In doing its job, there may be virus on the outside of the mask. Wash your mask frequently. Don't touch the outside of your mask then your face. Don't lower your mask below your nose so you are breathing in air over the outside of your mask. Don't touch an infected surface then touch your face. Wash your hands. This is not difficult science to understand and its validity is very well proven and documented."
"Let's not let this devolve into a mask debate. If you come here to visit, please adhere to our local advisories and do what's asked to protect our small community. The very few visitors who think they're somehow special are seriously aggravating and we have enough to deal with. If our local restrictions don't appeal to you then stay home, it's that simple."
"Ah, a debate - such as when two opposing sides, while maintaining mutual respect, lay down their carefully considered argument based on logic and facts? True debates do not include name calling, shouting (or all caps), tribalism, or snap decisions based on smoke and mirrors. A real debate cannot occur in our current environment of selfishness and self-delusion.Recommendations for visiting St John or other areas with currently low infection rates or limited medical facilities.1. Self quarantine for at least 14 days before travel to reduce the possibility of you bringing more virus into the region.2. Follow all the medical guidelines for travel - keep your mask on always, wipe down touch points with alcohol-based or other effective disinfectants, maintain social distance even if that means stepping out of a crowded line, and have trip insurance that includes evacuation to more comprehensive medical care if needed. 3. While at your destination continue to follow medical guidelines. It is easy to stay socially distant if you try. Take your mask and use it when passing people on the streets and trails. 4. If you believe this is too much for you or you feel that you do not need to comply, do not travel.The future:1. The medical community is continually learning how to treat the disease, but if too many people need care, shortages have and will occur. Once effective treatment is established and supplies are available, more risk (including travel) will become acceptable.2. Testing. More information on strength and length of immunity, including what a positive antibody test means and doesn't mean, is being gathered from ongoing studies. One of the best tests may be a cheap, immediate antigen test to identify level of contagion that is done daily or every other day. This saliva test is available but needs to get through the FDA. If you are positive, you are probably contagious and should take appropriate measures (don't go to work, school, shopping, restaurant, etc). This type of testing will allow safe reopening.3. Vaccination. There are around 120 vaccines in the pipeline. Because the disease organism is known, a vaccination can be created against it - this is unlike the guessing game done when putting together a selection of targets for the next flu season. No, vaccines do not cause autism but even when a safe and effective vaccine is available, there will be lots of people who will refuse to get one, perhaps too many to stop transmission of the disease. This puts a serious kink in the ""we are waiting for a vaccine"" idea."
"Barianne, we just returned. Same route you are taking. It was easy breazy. Zero issues. I was nervous about flying through SJU as we normally fly everywhere nonstop. Our original flight home was cancelled about 10 days before we left. Jet Blue put us on a later flight that would’ve had a much longer layover. We decided to stay an extra night so we could be on the short layover flight. I though perhaps it would get cancelled again but it didn’t. Once I realized that Jet Blue has several flights to SJU daily, it eased my mind a bit. Have a great trip. We had a fabulous time"
"All the valid concerns all of us have. With that being said, we recently booked our travel and where surprised at the flexibility offered by all the booking vendors that allow us to cancel (not reschedule where your money is still parked somewhere in the event you need it during these times). Flights booked through points which we can use in future if we cancel or reschedule. Gallows Point resort allows cancellation 48 hours before arriving. Car rental also allows cancellation until last minute. Some precaution we are planning to take are below. It is over whelming but I am excited for a well deserved break on the beautiful island. We will be using local vendors as much as we can to give them our business as we can afford. We are budget travelers but for this trip, we are not counting the money as long as it provides us flexibility, safety and comfort. We plan to fly out on Aug 22 through Aug 30. We booked a villa with kitchen to avoid eating out. We have the luxury of working from home so we are isolated and don’t go out unless grocery shopping. We will quarantine 15 days after coming back. With the HEPA filters, chances of catching the virus on the flight is less than catching it on the airport or at a grocery store. We are prepared with cleaning wipes, masks, face shield and sanitizer. Booked the car from STT so we don’t have to be around lot of people on the crowded ferry. With that being said, we are checking the numbers everyday in our state (Massachusetts) as well as on the USVI and if they increase drastically in next 10 days, we will cancel our plan. Does that guarantee we won’t get the virus? Unfortunately No! But with all the research and following all guidelines set by the gov, we hope we will be safe and can enjoy this vacation.Edited: 8:01 pm, August 09, 2020 "
Adding to my below reply- We are also avoiding layover in a state with high number of cases even though they are much cheaper. Taking the shortest possible layover in San Juan both ways.
"Gallows Point new/current Summer/Fall 2020 cancellation fee if at least 48 hrs. prior to arrival is you lose your 5% deposit...... ""A 5% deposit is required to confirm your reservation. We will refund all payments made for room reservations, less a 5% cancellation fee, provided you cancel at least 48 hours or more prior to your arrival. Cancellations made within 48 hours of your arrival are non-refundable, cannot be applied to a future stay, and are subject to a cancellation penalty equal to 100% of the gross rent, plus 5% credit card fees """
"Hi Ed Thanks for sharing the cancellation policy. I will check with them tomorrow. Initially we booked through Expedia which allowed full refund if cancelled 48 hours prior to booking date. Upon calling the resort, they confirmed the same cancellation policy and since price was same, we cancelled the Expedia booking and went with resort directly."
"We are doing things but with measured risk: I.e. eating outside or getting takeaway, using steps in hotels, masking, social distancing, limited service in rooms. Most museums, libraries and attractions remain closed or on limited hours with reservations and online tix required. Many restaurants on limited operations. Some parked and tennis courts open but it’s spotty at least here out west."

Has a sitting US President ever visited the Virgin Islands?
Yes. Harry Truman. Joe Biden visited when he was VP.
"I thought Bill Clinton was down recently (not sitting pres), maybe after the hurricanes??Edited: 11:21 am, August 29, 2020 "
"Hoover, Roosevelt, Clinton. Biden still visits as he has family here."
I think I remember stories about Nixon at Caneel years ago. It must have been when he was president because there were protests from people in their boats. I hope my memory is correct.
"Bill Clinton was here twice after the storms - second time with Hillary (guess she’s got him on a short leash) and I believe his efforts were/are focused on building new schools and a hospital while Bloomberg’s efforts are focused on the power grid. I do not know the status but I am sure that everyone is grateful for their help.Edited: 12:45 pm, August 29, 2020 "
https:/…
Clinton was here last year to tour RHI program and they held their Clinton Global Initiative disaster recovery workshop at UVI. He hasn’t funded anything notable in awhile that I’m aware of. Bloomberg/Segunda have some really cool things in the works including a micro grid and a lot more that people will never know they were behind and they are good with that :) they are not appreciated by all but they should be!
"Well, TournesolSJ, let's us know what they are doing since there's no news. I was disappointed at progress at Cinnamon when I went this summer. I know there's some infrastructure issue, but people with lesser means are getting things done.Somebody put a microgrid on PR. Disappointing. Google because I can't remember where it was."
"Ms411 - Cinnamon was going really well but slowed way down with environmental hurdles compounded by corona. it’s not lack of resources or will to get it done, that’s all I can say! :) I don’t know anything about how it would work but the people putting it together are more than capable. It’s going to be awhile though!"
