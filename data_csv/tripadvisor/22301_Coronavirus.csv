Is it safe to travel to Khao Lak due to the risk of coronavirus? Booked to go there in 3 weeks. I take injections which lower my immune system.
"I don’t think any of us on an Internet forum,are qualified to say if it’s safe or unsafe.We all have the same information,as each other at our fingertips,so unless we are advised it’s unsafe to travel to Thailand,which has not happened at this point,then it’s up to us as individuals to assess our own situations & make a decision on that.I go in 2 weeks & at this moment in time,I am definitely going ahead with my holiday,unless in the next 2 weeks the FCO advises against it.But if you have a lower immune system,then that really has to be your decision & not the decision of strangers on a forum.Hopefully all will be well & we’ll be enjoying those cocktails in the sun,at the same time.Tracy x"
Ask your doctor not strangers on a Travel Forum.
"Great input Dodger, judging by your recent posts it seems that you have a thing for Coronavirus threads.There is absolutely nothing wrong with asking strangers on a travel forum, as long as this is only one of many methods of gathering information. I'm travelling to Khao Lak via Malaysia in March so am keeping a keen eye on this forum and others for information. As helpfully advised by Tracey, check the FCO (Foreign & Commonwealth Office that specialise in UK citizen Travel advice) should be the first point of call. Public health England is worth a look and also the World Health Organisation website should be a useful source of information and contains travel advice. Also as Dodger so politely alluded, your doctor will understand your health better than anyone so I'd speak with them too."

"Ollie G, maybe it’s because this same question is asked 5/10 times daily. Why don’t you FO and answer them all ?"
Yes these new threads are rather tiresome..A scan back over the topics over the last 2 or3 weeks will reveal very many similar threads.
Dodger - Answer them all? No thanks i'll leave that to you! I didnt realise you'd been appointed the TA Coronavirus focal point but thanks for your efforts.
Tiresome is an understatement!! Particularly when a lot seems to be trolling.This is still TripAdvisor and not HealthAdvisor yes?
"@Troublesome and KhunBill,Forgive me if I am wrong but this is the first Coronavirus thread in the Khao Lak forum. Maybe for yourselves who frequent the various other Thailand TA forums this topic is becoming tiresome, but there are plenty of us who just view a specific forum so please bare this in mind when moaning about repetition."
"Ollie, there obviously a lot you didn’t realise. You just decided to judge and lecture with getting all your fact together. Besides as stated this is Trip Advisor not Health Advisor. It’s probably for this reason TA admin deletes most of the Coronavirus treads.Edited: 10:06 am, February 11, 2020 "
"Little Ollie SnowflakeEdited: 1:00 am, February 12, 2020 "
"Possibly the first, but so many have been closed, so not sure.Like the virus itself, 1 cured (closed), 3 more infected (new queries) admitted......damn TA virus..........think we found a new one."
TA virus seems to spread much faster than Coronavirus.

Its so refreshing to see the Khao Lak mothers club still invites or even allows the odd Snarkfest to participate.
Excellent jousting; takes one's mind off the coronavirus media event. If you want first class entertainment the cruise groups on facebook are brilliant. Every day there is groundhog day.

"Thanks Walkers for your sensible and informative post, I for one will keep an eye out for further updates."
"Thanks very much, I also ditto Ollie G’s reply and look forward to receiving further updates."
"I have found this site to be the best for fact-based information...https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/It puts into perspective the issue is largely confined (thankfully) to an area of China in lockdown. Interesting that the number of serious currently-infected cases went up from 12% to 21% in the past week. Yesterday, a staggering 15,000 new cases and 242 deaths, may they RIP. I agree if you are a nervous type, elderly or have underlying health conditions better to postpone. I will fly to Bangkok next week and have no concerns whatsoever."
"Procol - LOL.""Its so refreshing to see the Khao Lak mothers club still invites or even allows the odd Snarkfest to participate"".I might be one of the mothers' club you refer to ...

"@mrssmith. Good link, it makes it crystal clear that there should be absolutely zero cause for concern outside of China. Im in Thailand now for the next few months and my risk is no more than being at home.Probably better chance of being struck by lightning."
Not Me - apparently you have been using it for centuries and it no longer has any currency LOL
No its use by date was october 1972 so its not quite as effectiveJust watch out for the old geezer with the red zimmer frame on your daily mad dash to the lamingtons
"Ok, I will confess to having a bit of fun with this thread.To be honest though IMHO, no-one can advise any other traveller about the risks of travelling to a particular country and the risks associated with the corona virus (or however it should correctly be called).Getting your advice about whether you should or should not travel to a place from a TA forum post and its responses seems extremely foolhardy to me. There are much more reliable sites available for that purpose such as the UK department of foreign affairs or whatever it is called in the UK in so far as the OP is concerned. For others, there are generally other government agencies that can provide advice.This is a situation that has no definitive answer. It is still developing and ultimately every traveller needs to make their own assessment and that assessment is often influenced by risk appetite.I have booked flights for Vietnam for three weeks in July. I am not a nervous nelly, but have not made any plans just yet and am waiting to see how the coronavirus thing plays out. But I can guarantee that my decision will not be based on TA forum responses. The last place I would rely on in making that decision is a TA forum.So I have been a little silly, because IMHO it is a little silly."
"I have an old 'Q'lude' and hit of 'blotter'....for memorabilia sake......LOLMight explain a lot............nuff saidEdited: 10:01 pm, February 12, 2020 "
"You must be a Yank. The 'ludes were as I understand it something of the Woodstock era there. Unfortunately, apparently for a 'bored average housewife' in OZ in the sixties the best options were Bex or Vincients, or Valium if you were lucky and well connected. Of course, if you moved in other circles, your options may have been wider. I think Germaine Greer and others are more equipped to comment on that than me."
Procol .. that old geezer was usually my recently deceased father. Although he was also partial to a bit of pavlova.

procol .. 108!! You are seriously lucky. I would love to meet your Mum - the stories she could tell and the wisdom she must have. Enjoy her for all that and more.
"Thanks Walkers, really appreciate the update from a local as we are heading to Khao Lak in May. Do you know of cases in Khao Lak and Phuket? Cheers"
"no,heard nothing,schools open as usual,to be honest,i dont see a change here"
You have nothing to fear but fear itself.
"Yesterday, 53 Thais and two foreigners died as a result of road accidents. 48 deaths were motorcyclists. On Tuesday, 71 people died. This year so far, 2,017 people have died and 134,990 injured in road accidents. Please note, statistics are updated if people die later #Thailand ‬"
What will people worry about next ? If Coronavirus doesn't kill you something else will. Enjoy life because one thing is for sure eventually life comes to an end.
"My honest opinion is that you just don’t know. I’m in Bangkok now 17th Feb 2020 and was in Khan Lak a few days back. 1) You will be stuck on a flight/ at an airport where people from all over Thailand will have travelled. 2) Many people have masks on, but as you could pick it up by being in close proximity and also people take off masks to eat, you just can’t tell.You may be fine, but if you pick up things easily and can’t get rid of them easily, you are the only one who could decide. There are cases in Chaing Mai and of course people travel around. Most Thai people wear masks, use hand sanitisers and are careful, but some don’t. People are being screened as they arrive to see if they have a temperature, but I guess it’s a bit late by then."

we postpone our trip to Singapore and Khaolak in March 2020 as I am prone to a chest infection I am gutted as I was looking forward to going better to be safe than sorry
That's a shame #57.Actually there are more cases and there have been more deaths as a result of the virus in the UK than in Thailand and Singapore combined.
"My son and his family are currently in Phuket and he says its fine a bit quieter than usual but life goes on . FACT 18,000 died in America last flu season"
This is our issue. My husband has asthma.Can I ask did you choose to cancel and lose your holiday or where you able to swop dates?We’ve had emailed from our airline ‘coincidentally’ offering us to change our flight dates if we can travel. But no guidance on not travelling from fco so we would lose hotel if we didn’t go. We are a family with children so it’s a lot to lose.
"HH #60.... If the published statistics are correct you would be safer in Thailand than in many European countries. A concern however is the frequency with which flights are being cancelled.Edited: 3:09 am, March 10, 2020 "
"sadly,this forum has lost track.comments on here are offensive,and frankly not helpful"
"@Walkers, completely agree. It's all a bit silly now. What’s it like in Khao Lak right now? Have you noticed a drop in trade recently?"
"I agree with you Walker. However I can’t see a problem with people enquiring about the Coronavirus in Khao Lak as many are naturally concerned, me included. We are going there this Friday to celebrate our Golden Wedding Anniversary so we are in our 70s, although thankfully in good health. If people don’t like the questions being asked then avoid this forum. I know no one has a crystal ball but surely people can express their concerns and I must say that the majority of replies have been very helpful.Edited: 1:15 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"i agree 100% people wanting to know,just some of the replies are not ok.it is getting quieter here, seems life as normal so far here.certainly a drop in customers,and hotels reporting record cancellations"
Thanks Walker. I agree with all your comments.
"Hi,Yes, some of the responses are way out of order. For those of you coming here soon I wish you a safe journey and an enjoyable holiday."
We're now back in the UK and we both genuinely wish we were still in KL. The news and general stupidity of people still over-reacting especially regarding shopping is truly staggering.
