Does anyone know if I can show my Announcement to enter Croatia number on my phone rather than print it?Thanks
We entered and only had it in our phone. They didn’t even need to see that as they had it all linked to our passport details.
Thats great thanks.
"I am a EU/Schengen citizen. My wife, however, is from the US but has legal residency in the Schengen area. I understand that she will be treated the same as me - that is, she doesn't need to show booked accommodation, etc.When I want to fill out the required entry forms, there are a few issues I am confused about and hoping that you guys can clarify:1.) There are two types of documents that I can choose: Passport and official/national ID card. It's easy enough for me, but what do I do about my wife? Enter her passport or the legal permanent residency ID?2.) My first inclination would be to use her passport. However, will doing so create problems since it's a US passport?3.) The form asks for the accommodation we are staying at as well as dates. We are not booked anywhere since we like to be flexible. We do, however, know where we are going to spend most of our time - just not the exact dates. Do I fill it out to the best of my knowledge/guess?4.) Is it imperative to fill out the form online or is it alright to do so at the border?Many thanks. Just hoping to calm my nerves..."
I would book somewhere for the first night at least.
"Please can anyone advise when this form should be completed? We are travelling on 9th August.The form states: 'the announcement is valid from' - so should I insert today's date or the date of travel?It also asks for details of travel and contact with persons recovering from COVID-19 in the last 14 days, so suggests 14 days before travel?? Any advice gratefully received.Thank you :)"
We’re from the UK and filled the form in on the morning we travelled- mostly because we didn’t know about it! I would imagine 24/48hrs prior to travel would be perfect.
"My friend and I are going to visit Dubrovnik shortly. I would like to make sure the entry goes smoothly but I am confused over the form we need to complete. We are flying to Dubrovnik. The form mentioned on the Croatian website refers to needing to “display on the windshield of your vehicle in order to facilitate the border crossing” and refers to “passengers in the vehicle” and “crossing the border”. So the form looks like it is for a car, not a plane. Where is the form if we are travelling to Croatia by plane please? Easyjet will refuse to let us on their plane unless we have the correct form filled in. Many thanks for your help! Tony"
"Hi,We are flying to Croatia for a sailing trip (renting a yacht from Trogir, Split). But the Enter Croatia form only shows accommodation options that seem to fit hotels/hostels/etc (with an actual address). Does anyone how we should fill out the form on our case? I was not able to find any contact phonenumbers from Enter Croatia site to ask about it directly."
"Think that yacht with concrete name and registered harbor can be written in this form.Try to write, submit and if site gives out certificate of entering, everything OK.Edited: 7:33 am, August 13, 2020 "
"I completed the form in my name, with passport details. It didn’t ask me to complete details of 3 family members (Husband, 2 children ) who are travelling with me. We are all staying in the same place, same flights etc Is this correct?"
"I have a question about the form to enter Croatia! For one of the boxes it asks about ‘self isolation/quarantine measure in country?’ The choices are YES or NO. I don’t know if this means, ‘is there an isolation/quarantine order on your country’ or ‘have you had to isolate/quarantine SPECIFICALLY in your country during covid’. Does anyone have the answer? Thank you so much for you help!"
The question is if there is a self isolation-quarantine measure in your country of residence and since you are coming from Uk the answer is no.Miki
