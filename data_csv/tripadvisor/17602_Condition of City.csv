"Is it really as bad as some reports I have seen,I have been 4 times but the last time was 2014I am talking about agressive homless,feces and urine covered streets,needles,open drug use and so forth.I never was nervous about the homeless,never saw any filth,and always ranked it as one of my favorite vacations,so whats really going on there ?"
Have you read some of the recent threads here? SF still has some of the hottest real estate market in the country. Case in point. $2.5 millions for a shack for tech people with stock options or those with a windfall from selling a house they bought 20 years ago. https:/…Do you think the market would be like this if the city is as bad as you think?Yes we have a huge homeless/unsheltered folks problem here and some of them are mentally ill and have addiction issues. But they pose more of a danger to themselves than to others. I don't live in the city anymore but visit most weekends when I am in town. My family and friends still live and raise their families with young kids in the city. Areas where tourists usually go tend to have a higher concentration of the unsightly folks. Namely around Union Square.
A lot of this stem from certain conservative news outlets and social media accounts that love to paint SF as the way you describe. Same people who vilify and can't stop obsessing about folks like AOC in Congress.I think most things are covered in this recent thread.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60713…I don't think it is any worse than 2014. The skyline might be a little different and there might be more rideshare cars clogging the streets. But the same urban ills and social problems appear the same to me.Edited: 1 year ago 
I just wear a pair of Paddington boots and slog my way through the inches of feces in front of Nieman Marcus etc and it turns out fine.
If you are coming as a tourist than the tourist areas are fine.
"Et tu, Anthony."
"Not knowing what reports you've seen, it's hard to comment if it's that bad. Media outlets love to point at San Francisco for all sorts of things. Make up your own mind. My city is a very compact urban microcosm of what's happening in other cities across the country... it's just easier to ignore everywhere else."
Just back from this great City and would def return. I never felt unsafe just saddened by the sheer number of desperate people who appear to have a range of problems and issues to contend with and no real safety net to catch them. The main tourist areas are busy and just be sensible and go to enjoy rather than worry about it.
I doubt you will notice much different from your last visit 5 years ago.Head out to the great neighborhoods and you won’t see anything that you are expecting.
">>> I doubt you will notice much different from your last visit 5 years ago. <<<Exactly. I am downtown every day and while there is obviously a serious homelessness problem in the city, I don't find it noticeably different to five years ago."
"You ask us what’s going on, but make no mention of an intended visit. I notice you live near gorgeous Asheville. I’m a regular visitor and love the food, art scene and hiking. But, Asheville has its own homeless and street people issues. So, you can’t be a stranger to understanding our similar struggles."
"Just bring your contamination suit, level a and you'll be fine. https:/…It keeps me warm, but I find I need to layer it with a ski parka and arctic fleece when I go to Alcatraz or anywhere near the Ocean. I see the tourists in their short contamination suits that they wear at home and I know they'll have to buy their embroidered I♥️San Francisco suits at Fisherman's Wharf for the summer days here.The rivers of flowing sewage are nice this time of year, so come and enjoy."
"Lol Holodan. Years ago when Monsters Inc came out, our work team dressed up with that theme for Halloween with some in hazard suits. DIY with yellow rain gear and medical face shields. Many of you know I am in healthcare. I got to try something similar to that suit for a drill during the whole SARS epidemic years ago. Very claustrophobic. I have a colleague who was in Liberia during the ebola epidemic who survived it but did not know he would at the time. So Anthony - got any other questions? Asheville is on my bucket list but I have not made it there yet."
"What you've seen are right-wing hit pieces that Conservatives create to mock San Francisco (the progressive heart of the nation). If anything has changed since your last visit - it's likely been things for the better. Hayes Valley is now a thriving neighborhood with amazing shopping and food. Mid-Market is no longer the scary extension of the Tenderloin that it once was (still has a ways to go, but I walk it often now and believe me, it's changed)."
