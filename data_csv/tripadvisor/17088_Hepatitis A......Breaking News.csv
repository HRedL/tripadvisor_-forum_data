The Oahu and Kauai Genki Sushi Restaurants have been shutdown as the source of the Hepatitis A outbreak.khon2.com/2016/…More info at 9 am 9/16.The incubation period could be 14-28 days.
Ooh!!I buy large frozen scallops occasionally. Wonder what brand they used.Edited: 4 years ago 
"Supposedly, the distributor sold the infected scallops only to Genki. However, I see that that part of the article has been changed in the past hour. Odd.Hopefully, the press conference tomorrow will provide clarification."
Here's a link to a thread discussing the Hep A vaccine:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29222…
Here's an update from the news conference:hawaiinewsnow.com/story/32766495/all-oahu-ka…
"""I buy large frozen scallops occasionally. Wonder what brand they used.""Do you eat them raw or cooked?I won't eat any type of meat that is not cooked.I do eat fruits & veggies that are not cooked though!And looking at the link from SW reply #4, veggies are not totally safe.And thinking back, I've seen TV shows or articles that mention people getting sick from apple cider, ice cream & more.I do think overall that our food sources are generally safe though."
"In 21 years we never had a problem with eating contaminated food on Kauai. And we ate out quite a bit and also at home.We did not eat sushi or uncooked , our under cooked fish, meat, poultry. We very often bbq'd at home, or at our lodgings and would eat meals out all over the island. Kauai has great places to eat.We shopped at Costco, Time Market, and sunshine markets, and Wallmart. Never a problem with anything. This is one particular company that had the problem not some island wide empidemic. Stay smart and eat healthy, you all should be just fine.."
"Dusty, I purchase raw local scallops from nearby fish markets, but occasionally purchase frozen imported jumbo-size scallops to make scallop nigiri sushi at home. The scallops are basically served raw, with a mayo topping and slightly seared with a burner. I usually choose scallops from Canada, avoiding those from China and SE Asia.We eat raw seafood once a fortnight on average. Salmon, Tuna, oysters and scallops.Hey, don't think raw veggies are safe. We had a huge problem with bagged salad leaves 6 months ago in Oz. Salmonella was the culprit and it resulted in 100 severely ill. Before that, it was E-coil in frozen berries imported from Peru. Will this make me stop consuming raw food? I don't think so. Dusty as you mentioned, I too think our food sources are generally safe. There are certainly exceptions though."
"I don't think it much matters where the product came from or was harvested. Hep A is not a food issue, it is a handling and processing issue. So the scallops could come from anywhere and have had the problem."
"Aloha from Kaua'i!No one here is much worrying about it as far as I can tell - just no more Genki Sushi for the time being.Don't stress over a food handling and processing issue....this is one small chain restaurant on the island. The other being over on O'ahu.Malama Pono,Janet"
"If you travel much at all, I'd get the shots. We have had ours for years -- just one less thing you have to worry about."
"There are 11 Genki restaurants on Oahu, and one also has to remember that people(and the virus) travel. The latest total is now 206 cases:hawaiinewsnow.com/story/32680042/number-sick…Get vaccinated, folks."
"Of course people here on Kauai are worrying about it. We love (relatively) cheap sushi at Genki, and one article said a poll found 25% of island residents reported eating there (that probably includes Oahu). Worse, we have tried their scallops within the last month, and my daughter had some routine blood work come back with very abnormal levels. On advice of her doctor, she just went back today to get 7 more vials of blood drawn to do a full panel. So this is definitely impacting us, and it is not over because we won't have the results for a few days, and a follow up visit next week (if they can squeeze her in, because Kauai).Coincidentally, we know someone who was at Genki when ordered to shut down: they seated everyone on the wait list, then locked the doors while everyone started/finished eating, and didn't tell people why.I realize these things happen, and I'm not really blaming the restaurant, but you can bet we are concerned.Edited: 4 years ago "
"So sorry to hear this, KauaiHiker! I can only imagine what you're going through right now! Sending all good thoughts your way! Hope you can give us good news soon!"
We'll be thinking of you.
"Aloha,Hoping for good news."
staradvertiser.com/breaking-news/…Sure sounds like an epidemic to me.
"Kaua'i Hiker, I hope all turns out well."
"Thanks everyone for your thoughts. Fortunately, kids don't usually have symptoms, fight it off and then are immune, so we're not too worried even if she does turn out to have it. I guess I should be more worried about my wife and I."
"""I guess I should be more worried about my wife and I"".True, KauaiHiker, but we're parents and parents worry about their children no matter what.Hoping the blood results are HEP negative and it's a minor anomaly.What I'm gleaming form this whole event is the sensibility of innocultion. Not only for one's personal well-being, but also to reduce the susceptibility of becoming an unaware, infectious carrier. I would be quite concerned to discover I had transmitted it to others."
"Sorry for the lack of update. It seems the hep A scare has passed, despite further service workers (flight attendant) reporting positive. That kind of mirrors our experience in the end. My daughter showed antibodies on her blood work, which was worrying until we found her immunization records that proved she'd been vaccinated. My wife went ahead and got vaccinated, and even tough I never found my records, I strongly suspect I had been vaccinated for 3rd world travel.In any case, none of us got really sick, and we don't know if we were ever exposed. Wife and daughter definitely felt under the weather at the time, but it could've been anything else, even just psychosomatic knowing we had eaten the scallops. As time passes and none of us got worse, we just have to say that through vaccinations or no actual exposure, we dodged it. I suspect that vaccination and monitoring by the dept of health will keep the threat low enough to die out, if it hasn't already."
Happy to hear there were no major health issues other than a bit of stress.
"Good news, KauaiHiker!Unfortunately, cases have continued to appear. All on Oahu according to the news."
"Aloha,Mahalo for the update Kauai Hiker, glad all is good for you folks."
