"News reports the last few days have reported that Covid-19 will not present as a second wave. There are theories to why Denmark has been successful so far with the virus but I believe it is indictive that the virus is in fact going away, and forever. I know some ""top experts"" said this will definitely not be the case but I think people need to at least keep in mind that not all experts share this belief and even the best top experts have been wrong in the past. Two prominent European virologists have stated the virus will in fact disappear."
I guess that your prominent virologists have access to better crystal balls than the world's leading scientists.
"@Triszza, I don't really know your motivation for making these claims, but you have some kind of agenda for sure. There's no way anyone at this time would be able to make a claim that it will just ""disappear"".None of the experts here are saying a second wave is not expected, so please don't spread this kind of misinformation based on what seems to be dubious sources (although who can tell, since you don't quote them, just mention ""prominent virologists"")."
"""None of the experts here are saying a second wave is not expected,""It is reported in Denmark! It is true. It is in the major news reports. Obviously you have not seen the reports. That's my agenda for posting on this forum. People need positive news now. I'm not saying the situation is still not serious globally; I'm saying the situation in Denmark is better then expected. Why can't you at least consider there may be good news?Edited: 3:34 am, May 21, 2020 "
"I'm not against reporting and sharing good news, but you have to be very careful not to do so in a way that leads to irresponsible measures taken.Technically you're right that a second wave is not expected, but that is only seen in the context of the interventions and careful measures taken by the government. If nothing is done, then a second wave might very well occur. You say in your first post ""I believe it is indictive that the virus is in fact going away, and forever."" There is no way you can make that statement backed by evidence. I hope you're right, but saying something like that is not responsible. No one can make the opposite statement either, we simply don't know at this time."

"The remarks by Mølbak, leader of SSI, the state institute dealing with vaccines, were the basis for those news stories.Mølbak has emphasized that the remarks should be understood in the way that the virus will continue to be around, very likely say for the rest of 2020, but that further waves won't represent a very comprehensive or disastrous surge, compared to what was thought earlier. Because, due to the effective measures taken by the Danish authorities, the society will know how to deal with problems, when they occur.Quote:"" I cannot imagine, that our society will let a Second Wave evolve into a major epidemic again. It will be reduced when evolving. So I don't see a second epidemic ahead of us."" (""Jeg kan ikke forestille mig, at man i Danmark vil lade en anden bølge udvikle sig som en stor epidemi. Den vil man begrænse i opløbet. Så jeg ser ikke en anden epidemi foran mig."")Details from (in Danish):https://www.altinget.dk/sundhed/artikel/kaar…Edited: 5:22 am, May 21, 2020 "
"""""I believe it is indictive that the virus is in fact going away, and forever."" There is no way you can make that statement backed by evidence.""I made that statement based partly on the words of two prominent European virologists who are also medical doctors. I find it amazing that they said this given that most virologists around the world say the virus will not go away and will definitely come back. I also based my statement that doctors are not always right. I have seen this many times in my life. The world's top doctors were very wrong about the course of Ebola. Same with SARS in 2003 which is closely related to Covid-19."
"""Quote:"" I cannot imagine, that our society will let a Second Wave evolve into a major epidemic again. It will be reduced when evolving. So I don't see a second epidemic ahead of us.""""Thank goodness. I hope I am allowed to enter Denmark this summer."
"If you have compelling evidence to support your statement, then by all means share it with us. I'm definitely open to changing my mind. At the moment, I choose to believe the majority of experts that say it's possible we'll experience a second wave - unless we take action to avoid it.Comparing SARS-CoV-1 with SARS-CoV-2 is of course reasonable. There's one major difference between them though. People infected with SARS-1 developed symptoms within a few days and very few didn't develop any symptoms at all, so it was fairly easy to do contact tracing and isolation of those cases. As you know, people infected with SARS-2 can develop symptoms after several weeks after infection and many never develop symptoms at all, making it much more difficult to contain."
"""People infected with SARS-1 developed symptoms within a few days and very few didn't develop any symptoms at all, so it was fairly easy to do contact tracing and isolation of those cases.""I actually heard and read two different reasons SARS went away. One, SARS was only transmissible by symptomatic people and was mostly spread in a hospital setting (because they were very sick) so it became easy to control in that setting. Two, SARS mutated to a less virulent form. Recently researchers in Arizona US discovered that Covid-19 has also mutated in exactly, or close to exactly, the same way as SARS did. Conid-19 is still very new. Just two months ago all the top health authorities thought it was spread mainly by symptomatic people. That changed, as everyone now knows. However, we still don't know the complete picture. No one knows how this will progress and end, if ever. I'm just sharing what I believe is certainly possible: Covid-19 might surprise the experts. like say specialists, and go away. What has happened in Denmark should at least give people hope that at least we can control our future to a large extent.Edited: 1:54 pm, May 21, 2020 "
"@Jacob D, The multi poster/multi named T Troll is spreading some foolishness and expanding. Just as it predicted the virus would be gone in weeks in New York City (about a month ago), now promoting the same BS for other areas. Infection rates are down in some areas of the USA but increasing by thousands of cases per day in other areas in the USA. Wide variability but urban close contact areas in many states states are hot beds. Even half life calculations used in epidemiology regarding virus activity mean zero to said Troll. Be well, be safe, dream of traveling, Report Trolls."
"I simply gave my right to an opinion. It looks like the virus is in fact disappearing this spring, at least in Italy, just as some top European doctors predicted. Go read the news and see for yourself. While your at it go look up what's happening in Denmark and let us know the status."
"Virus is not going to disappear.Look at South Korea, Germany and now the huge second wave in Iran.If spring and summer could cure this, why is it then big in warm countries.The virus can be under control in some countries, but only as long as the majority is following the guidelines.You can always find few scientists or doctors saying opposite. Like anti-wax, cannabis and now virus.Lets be happy that virus is so low in Denmark right now and lets keep it low! Take care."
