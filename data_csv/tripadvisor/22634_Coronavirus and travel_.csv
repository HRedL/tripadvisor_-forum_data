"Was planning a last minute trip to Amsterdam for 2 nights on Tuesday the 17th of March.With all this fuss about the corona virus I don’t know if this is a good idea or not, anyone got any on info how Amsterdam is atm?"
"There are a ton of threads about this already on The Netherlands forum. Check them out.No one can make this choice for you.Edited: 9:54 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"Family is going before you and we aren’t too worried. All of us under 60, most under 30, relatively healthy, no underlying health conditions or chronic disease/illness, good immune systems, and have always been big on hand washing and hygiene. Our biggest concern is the airlines."
"""anyone got any on info how Amsterdam is atm?""I'm currently enjoying a cup of coffee in the center of town. It's sunny. People are going about their business normally. Everything that should be open is open. Just be aware of your surroundings to avoid the slow moving covid19zombies who occassionally wander out searching for fresh untainted blood."

"We are reveling in The NL with a haphazard approach to doing prevention. We should continue to do so. It would be interesting to watch.Of course within the sporadic efforts to do stuff - The King's Day celebrations are cancelled in Den Haag.https://nltimes.nl/2020/03/10/dutch-coronavi…Noord Brabant is doing some action too.https://nltimes.nl/2020/03/10/coronavirus-no…Edited: 4:53 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Re: article in post #4:I have been wondering about that fundamental claim underpinning the government's response strategy - that asymptomatic people can not be contagious. Also have had the feeling that our sober 'don't be hysterical' attitude has perhaps been a hindrance in using more proactive measures to get ahead of this. So I feel that article has a lot of merit.Edited: 4:57 am, March 11, 2020 "
"“ The King's Day celebrations are cancelled in Den Haag.”No, the Kings Day celebrations in The Hague are NOT cancelled. Only a concert called Kingsday Fest that was to take place in and around the football stadium of ADO Den Haag is cancelled. The organisation decided to pull the plug now, out of fear they would lose more money if they cancelled in a later stage. No decision had been made about the general Kings Day celebrations in The Hague or anywhere else in the country."
"I am glad you took the time to read. Hopefully you therefore also understand that our authorities have behaved in a completely clueless way.I used to think that the Dutch are far superior to most countries when it comes to knowing the science.I am deeply disappointed.And I am worried that besides serendipity and pure luck, the country would erupt with cases. And that would be not a fun time."
>> Only a concert called Kingsday Fest that was to take place in and around the football stadium of ADO Den Haag is cancelled. <<OK. My mistake. Its too early to cancel events that far.
"To the OP - I was thinking to propose that you drive to Amsterdam, instead of flying. The extra cost and time is potentially an investment, in ensuring that you are in better control of what you can do, if and when there is any disruption around your visit."
"“ Noord Brabant is doing some action too”I wouldn’t call what Noord-Brabant is doing “some action”. The measures that are taken have a very serious impact on people and the economy. Events with > 1000 visitors are forbidden, smaller events are urged to self cancel, people are asked to limit their social contacts for a week and are asked to work from home if possible for at least a week. If my friends, family, colleagues and myself are a good indication, people are complying with these measures. Shops, restaurants, theatres, cinemas etc etc all have to deal with a significant drop in visitors, directly resulting in a financial hit. I believe it needs to be done, especially to protect the most vulnerable amongst us, but please don’t take this effort lightly. It has a huge impact on every day life here.Edited: 5:14 am, March 11, 2020 "
"""anyone got any on info how Amsterdam is atm?"" I do want to add an addendum to this which I should have mentioned. The city is definitely noticeably much more quiet than usual in terms of numbers. It began a while ago with the absence of Chinese tour groups but now is much more than that.An article in the local press confirms the significant drop in numbers:https://www.at5.nl/artikelen/200546/horecabr… (Google translate can help)It mentions that hotel bookings are down 30% for example.But this speaks to people's reticence to travel at the moment and not to any particular risk which is greater here than anywhere else."
"""I was thinking to propose that you drive to Amsterdam, instead of flying. ""That would take a minimum of 12 hours there and 12 hours back. I don't think it would be worth doing for a two-night stay.Edited: 7:38 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Currently travelling back from 4 days in amsterdam. You wouldnt even know coronavirus existed here if you didnt look online. I would come without worry, just take precautions and wash your hands more than usual"
