"Should we cancel our upcoming trip (November 12-16, 2014) to San Juan because of the chikungunya epidemic?"
"The flu kills 40k people a year in the US. Should we avoid the continental US during flu season?Chikunguya is a mosquito-borne disease that causes joint pains and fevers. It has caused a handful of deaths in immunocompromised people. No lasting effects. Disease resolves in a week. The numbers of affected people in PR have gone down, as probably all the succeptible people got it already. It was new to our area, so it got a lot of press. It is now in the US, so not much can be done."
"I was worried about this too and spent last week in PR. We wore bug spray (mostly Avon, sometimes with deet) and reapplied a couple times a day. I did not get any bug bites in the biobay or el Yunque. Honestly, the only time I got big bites was a couple times in the afternoon by el Morro in the park area where people fly kites. So I'd use a little stronger big spray when there. I'm glad I didn't miss seeing any of these places :)I did see people working at the resorts spraying themselves with off. Just spray in the morning and once or twice later in the day, it doesn't hurt to avoid getting bit. It is a beautiful place. You won't worry once you're there."
"If people were flying kites, then the wind was too strong for mosquitos. Maybe the bugs were from the grass? Something to consider."
"Yes it's absolutely possible they were something else, that's why I meant to type bug bites and not mosquito bites. They swelled and itched like mosquito bites but I didn't see the bug when it happened. That just wasn't an area where I thought I needed extra bug spray. In the mangroves, I had a ton on. We went a lot of different places and didn't see mosquitoes. We did avoid the beach at dusk as some people suggested. No problems at the beaches during the day. We wore the bug spray just in case., just like we do extra hand washing here during flu season."
"Don't cancel your trip because there is a slim possibility of catching a non-deadly virus. I would be more concerned with the germs on the planes! I always get sick after a plane trip (as a germophobe, and I disinfect everything)! When I go to Pennsylvania in summer, I protect myself from ticks, so I don't get Lyme disease.I get a flu shot to protect myself from the flu.People who visit anywhere in the Caribbean should use repellent to protect themselves from Chikungunya and Dengue."
