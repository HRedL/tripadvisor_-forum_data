"I would just like to reiterate how important it is to protect yourself against mosquitoes. We returned Friday from six days in Manuel Antonio. I may have gotten only four or five mosquito bites, but now I suffering from dengue fever!! Spent last night in the ER. I used 100% DEET while doing tours and hikes and 25% for walking around and restaurants. If mosquitoes are usually attracted to you as they are me, use 100% all the time!That said, our trip was wonderful and I have nothing but great things to say about everything we did. "
"So sorry to hear you're suffering from dengue--I suppose it is some consolation that you got it diagnosed quickly, as many doctors in the U.S. may not recognize the symptoms.It sounds like you did everything you could and were just very unlucky. Your advice, however, is excellent. I have seen many vacationers take their chances rather than using mosquito protection, assuming that what they can't see won't hurt them."
What product is 100% DEET? I have only ever seen 25% DEET. I am a little concerned.
"The concentration of DEET is UNRELATED to it's efficacy! This is simply a misconception or a myth, if you prefer that term.A product containing 5% DEET has the same effect as one that contains 25%, or 80%, or 100%.The only difference is the time that protection lasts for. With 5% DEET you get about 90 minutes of protection, with 100% DEET you get about 10 to 12 hours! A product with 20 or 30% Deet will give you between 3 and 6 hours of protection, etc."
I never knew that. thanks for the explanation.Deb
"I don't mean to raise concern, just awareness. And the explanation of DEET concentration is correct; my apologies for confusing. The 100% DEET, in a baby-oil-like liquid, would last through the day. After showering, I would use the 25% spray to go out. I either missed some spots or it wore off. Again, I only got four or five bites over four and a half days. I bought the 100% DEET at REI; it's called Jungle Juice: http://www.rei.com/product/738782"
"EarlBaxter,Thanks for the heads-up. We are leaving in a week and will be in Manuel Antonio for 8 nights. Due to your post, we will take extra precautions. Thanks!After reading your post, I went to the CDC site and reviewed Dengue Fever and DHF. Fascinating reading. For those interested, here is the link:http://www.cdc.gov/NCIDOD/DVBID/dengue/I also reveiwed the issue of harmful effects of DEET. From everything I can find, it appears that DEET is both safe and effective. This excellent article is from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry of the US Department of Health and Human Services. …cdc.gov/consultations/…health-effects.htmlI hope the remainder of your recovery is uneventful. Please keep us posted on your progress.With warm regards,jim "
"Hi,I just returned from the doctor who said my illness might also be typhoid fever, which is a type of salmonella. I won't know for a couple weeks the actual diagnosis when blood tests are back.Regardless, both illnesses are possible in Central America. Lessons: protect against mosquitoes, take care in what you eat and drink.Won't keep me from going back!Lisa (EarlBaxter)"
"You are right, there is always a risk and if it is manageable, it shouldn't deter you.Repellant is easily applied and protects you against a variety of mosquito-borne problems, including Dengue and Botflies.With anything else, it's hit or miss but fortunately, the chances of contracting disease here are fairly low.Hope you feel better soon."
"EarlBaxter, I hope you are well now. Are you? Did you have to go to the ER because it was very bad, or because that's where one gets medical care at night?Since the trip was wonderful does that mean it wasn't so bad, and you'd go again. You were never in danger, I gather?Thanks."
Are mosquitos a year round problem? I will be there at Christmas.
Hi Lisa...Hope you are feeling better...and sorry about your situation!!roadadvisor@hotmail.comJust buckle up and enjoy the ride in paradise!
"Dengue is epidemic in the area right nowGo to www.cdc.gov for Dengue100% DEET is toxic use % suggested by CDC.Costa Rica Daily News–The Tico Times, Dengue fever tormenting ...Aug 26, 2008 ... town of Parrita and its environs are suffering a dengue fever epidemic ... Dr. Edgar Carrillo of the Max Teran Vals Hospital in Quepos. ...ticotimes.net/dailyarchive/2008_08/082608.htm "
"This is good advice. The biggest problem is that visitors rarely will notice mosquitos, as they are not bad at any time of the year in our area. It just takes that one strain that carries dengue to stick you and turn life bad for about 7-10 days. Sorry for you Earl. Enjoy Costa Rica tho!"
"Typhoid is salmonella, and it is from contaminated food or water (not mosquitoes, in case there is any misunderstanding). I'm not a doctor, but my daughter contracted a pretty serious case of typhoid in Mexico years ago, even after she had the vaccine. Very bad situation to get dengue and typhoid on one trip... and thankfully, both dengue and typhoid are very, very rare for a tourist in Costa Rica. Water in most areas where tourists would venture is very safe to drink. Mosquitoes bite all year, but dengue ""season"" is right now and through the end of the rainy season, when water tends to pool and breed mosquitos. Most towns that cater to tourists work hard to get rid of areas that breed, and the breakouts the last few years have tended to be within the local population, such as the outbreak earlier this year in Parrita north of Manuel Antonio. You should still be very careful. Note that dengue mosquitos are daytime mosquitos... so you should be most careful at dusk and dawn. Deet is not the only repellent that works. We have experienced a LOT more success in CR with Picaridin. The CDC is now recommending repellents that contain the active ingredient Picaridin. Not only is it not as ""toxic"" smelling and feeling as Deet products, but it doesn't melt plastic. But the best thing about it in my mind is that it comes in Avon Sunscreen products, which means that since we frequently apply sunscreen anyway, we're also protecting yourself from bites (no-see-ums and mosquitoes). Recently, I heard that Cutter products has a picaridin product on the shelves here in the USA, so it's easier to get immediately now (as an alternative to waiting for Avon by mail). Very lightweight clothes with long sleeves and pants are good to pack for dinner time, to enhance your bite prevention at dusk. (Spray lightly on clothing, and spray like crazy on exposed ankles and feet, etc.)"
"Are mossie's bad in April or are they more of a problem in the rainy season? My husband and son (6yrs) seem to be a favourite for all biting bugs even in the UK where we do not have many. I must taste yucky as I rarely get bitten, maybe this will be my turn?!Debating malaria tablets, would rather not take them unnecessarily. We are visitng Tortueguero, Arenal, Monteverde and Manuel Antonio in April. Suspect the worst of these will be Torteguero but even there according to UK information is that malaria medication is not necessary and does not help prevent dengue fever?What have other people done with children?Deet apparantly is safe for children over 2yrs old but sounds like awful stuff, would you put it on a 6yr old. I will investigate if we can get Picardin based products over here but are they adequate protection? Do not want to get hung up on it and it definitely will not spoil our holiday but also want to avoid them being bitten to shreds if I can do things to prevent it.Thanks for any advise, Frances"
"Dengue season is rainy season. April is the end of the dry season, and so dengue shouldn't be a problem in April on the west coast. Dengue mosquitos bite during the day, malaria at night, and neither is a threat to tourists, and for the places you are visiting, malaria is especially not currently an issue. That said, no one likes a lot of bites, and if your family is prone, use repellent frequently. I've never traveled with very young children, and the dengue problem has only arisen in CR in the last few years, so I can't answer regarding the safety issues for young children in the picardin vs. deet controversy. I will say that we've used picardin (rather than deet) for pregnancy. And personally, I think that picardin works better in Costa Rica. And it is really irritating using deet, because it melts parts of your laptop, phones, handbags, watch bands, and especially, your flip-flops! (rubber sandals) "
"It is hard to figure out the prevalence of dengue . We are going in early January, when things are a little drier; Earl, how did it turn out?  Debbie E "
"We were in Manuel Antonio in mid October and we picked up quite a few bites but neither of us came down with anything, thank God. We used 100% DEET and we were actually pretty casual spraying it on ourselves, we didn't take 20 minutes to cover every square inch or anything.Unfortunately it sounds like a crapshoot to some extent, although you are tilting the odds well in your favor by applying repellent a lot.I loved the place so much though I would go back and risk it even if I didn't have any repellent! It's worth the small risk! ;)"
"I was doing quite a bit of research yesterday including some rather specific studies. The anopheles gambiae mosquitos are the ones responsible for malaria which is not much of a concern in CR except for some areas. Check for the areas you are going to. The Aeded aegypti mosquito is the one responsible for yellow fever & dengue (yellow fever vaccines are not recommended for CR at this time). These are the daytime mosquitos. After I bought the 100% DEET, I found out there is no advantage to using anything past 50%. Up to 50% the only difference is the length of time it lasts. If you still want 100%, you can get it in the sporting section of Walmart of Target etc. I got some Ultrathon 35% DEET yesterday as reccommended by by travel consultant & put some on just to try out the feel. It didn't smell bad or feel bad at all.After reading about picaridin, which some say work better against the dengue carrying mosquitos, I found out that they can be used at the same time. I plan to bring both.Also I have not heard mention of permethrin. It is used to on your clothes, never on the skin. You can either soak your clothes in it or spray it on them. Do it in a well ventilated area untill they dry. It remains embedded in the fibers for up to 6 weeks or 6 washings. Not enough research out yet about clothing that comes with it already applied. So I personally would't trust pretreated clothes. It is a nerotoxin to the mosquitos & kills them when they land on your clothes. so they can't bite you through them. I know this was lenghty, but I hope it helps someone. EarlBaxter, I'm so sorry you got so sick. I do hope you recover soon. Also, if you are not aware, after a person gets dengue once, if they get it again it is much worse & can be quite serious."
Oh great! This will be my 5th trip to CR and neither me or my husband or children have suffered from mos. bites in the past. we have never even used any repellant. I am now traveling to CR next week with our 3 month old baby and I am freaking out! Any advice? You cannot use insect repellant on an infant?
"Hello Jill.We havent been having a lot of cases of dengue in the central pacific over the last rainy season and if your familly doesnt sufer from a lot of bites, you will not have a big problem. One other options is to buy a natural product here. I am going to ask an American who just had babys and never likes mosquitos about the product she uses. NATUREGUIDE"
Thanks Natureguide!
Hi Jill. I talk to my friend who just had a couple of twins and she said the best is to bring long and light fabric cloths. She doesnt know of any product good for babys. The time of our tour in the mangrove isnt going to affect the babys with mosquitos and B.V.V isnt very bad. NATUREGUIDE
"JillC12...I've been asking neighbors about dengue outbreaks because we're heading down to our place with my 8 month pregnant daughter this week. Other than Parrita, no one has heard of any cases. If you are worried, perhaps take some mosquito netting along for the stroller or to drape over the car seat or your baby bjorn or crib. You can purchase it at REI or on line."
"I wanted to suggest a natural repellant, Patchouli Oil, the real escential oil, as a possible safe alternative for infants and small children. I have used it and for the most part it has worked great.  I just returned from 10 days in Playa Conchal/Rio Celeste area. Was fortunate to see a ridley turtle come up on the beach at Conchal to lay its eggs. I sat and watched it for 4 hours, fascinating!! During this time i was being bitten by what i believe were sand fleas, after I broke a sweat the next day i was covered in itchy bites that have lasted a week now. I had no protection on at the time. So i would definately recommend covering the skin to avoid bites.  "
