Has anyone booked anything from owners apartments
"Take a look to your right TOP QUESTIONS For MYC - the second or third subject down is the one below: Why are Vacation Apartment Rentals a Bad Idea in NYC?Read this first and then you may garner some idea why a hotel accomodation is better for the NYC tourist - rental laws here, very different than other places in the world.Poppa"
Look at the FAQ section
I swear ..... this topic is like the crack cocaine of the NYC Forum. It's like a damn epidemic. I feel dirty just reading about it.

Thanks for the advise .Does anyone know any 2 bedroom hotels then with 4 beds in total and 2 bathrooms or an I asking too much.We are 4 females and thought it might be cheaper doing it this way but still require our own bed rather than 2 doubles.
Perhaps Eastgate Tower?
"What's your budget per room and exact dates of travel?Have you tried searching this on your own, or on this forum to see if this has been asked before? It's a popular question.What about websites like:www.kayak.comwww.travelzoo.comwww.quikbook.com"
"i still dont get it. I have booked an apartment twice via a website and all has gone well. How come if its illegal this place gets away with it? i mean it aint rocket science to track down illegal operators such as this, particularly as it has a website that has not 'disappeared' in 12 months. Perhaps my interpretation of an apartment is not the same as a new yorkers and what i book is not illegal. i do find this whole apartment thing VERY confusing..."
"Who do you think has jurisdiction over the internet? How do you propose that the NYPD shut down a website that is likely not based in New York City? And are you suggesting that an anonymous webpage should be admissible as evidence to evict someone from their apartment? We've seen many cases here where people's apartments are posted as apartment rentals without their knowledge, and tourists show up at their door expecting to stay. Meanwhile, the scammer has absconded with the money, and never lived in New York City in the first place. You were lucky that you got away with it without getting scammed or evicted. Please don't do it again."
describe what you booked (inc. address) and maybe someone can tell you if it was illegal
"anyone want to rent my NYC apartment. It's lovely, near the beach, has a pool, and it's 1000sq ft, bang in the center of Time Square. Also is has ample parking, and a doorman. All for $125 a night?!;)M"
"I think you're very gutsy mentioning the ""A"" word on this forum. Last time I brought up the discussion of illegal accomodations my post was deleted!!!LOL"
"Yes, I have stayed in vacation rentals all over the world, including NYC, and never ever had a bad experience. Just do your homework on what you choose."
"The rules for renting vacation apartments ""all over the world"" are different ""all over the world"". What is legal in one city may turn out to be illegal or a scam in another such as NYC. It is very dangerous to generalize and extrapolate."
"Well how about the law enforcers 'pretend' to book an apartment and then bust the shisters who are renting bogus apartments. Obviously they are not going to get evryone but getting some is still a win?? Tell me this. If you lived in an apartment and were going away for say 3 months would it be illegal for you to 1. let it out 2. allow friends to stay in it. and if the answer is yes can you explain why in simple terms. I am NOT suggesting it should be ok if its something which new yorkers are opposed to, im trying to understand it and i dont find the answers at all clear. It is obviously a VERY sensitive issue guaging by the 'emotion' in your answers."
"Law enforcement has limited resources. I have spoken to them and they said that they generally don't have the money to perform the kinds of stings on illegal apartment rentals that you describe. Also, many of these rentals aren't ""illegal"" in terms of law enforcement (until next week when Paterson signs that law.) They're ""illegal"" in terms of violating the purchase contract on the co-op or condo, which is a civil violation, not something the cops go after.As regards your question, it's absolutely OK to sublet your apartment for *three months*, provided you follow the rules of your co-op, condo or lease. The issue is in rentals of under one month."
"There's no ""one size fits all"" answer to your question; as jhwsander advised you, a sublet of more than 30-days is generally OK under zoning/building use statutes & regulations, but may not be permitted under the terms of a landlord's lease or, in the case of a condo or co-op apartment building, the by-laws or other governing provisions of the building association.As for your demand that the authorities conduct sting operations, the reality is that such investigations take time, personnel and money -- in woefully short supply when the City budget must continue to be slashed & this is a low priority in ""big picture"" terms. Plus, statutes are outdated (e.g., the fines are ridiculously low) & a court ruling last year cast a cloud of doubt on such enforcement of existing law.Let me amend what jhwanderer just indicated: the Police Department and what is usually thought of as ""law enforcement"" are concerned only with crimes and criminal prosecutions, not violations of civil statutes/regulations. [And violating a lease or ""house"" by-laws isn't even ""illegal"" in the civil sense; it's a contract violation, which can give rise to eviction or a civil lawsuit, but won't incur statutory, civil fines). Something can be ""illegal"", i.e., not authorized by/contrary to law, and yet not be a crime. Even under the new bill that just passed our State legislature and which seeks to address at least some of the problems, it won't be a crime to offer unauthorized rentals.For more info on the bill and background re: why people care about the issue, see my post #4, and the links therein, in this thread from yesterday:tripadvisor.com/…27135690Edited: 10 years ago "
Thank you. You have answered simply and without passing judgement upon those who ask the question! i get it now. Of course I agree wholeheartedly that if you are renting an apartment the last thing you would want is for your neighbor to be sub letting their place with people coming and going all the time with little regard to the rules of the body corp (what its called here). Thanks! The place we have rented from is herrickguestsuites. and i have presumed that it is all above board but i will certainly ask the question - i guess the only way to know for sure is to ask the tennants in the neighboring apartments.....
"PS I am so impressed with all your knowledge of civil/criminal law, statutes, bills etc etc. Are you lawyers??? I couldnt imagine the average australian having such an understanding of such things.. I for one do not. ... but them im JUST a school teacher. haha Power to you!"
