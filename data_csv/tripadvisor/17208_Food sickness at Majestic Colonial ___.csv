I read alot about people getting sick on the food at this resort. Don't they have a filtration system for the water? & why are there so many people getting sick on the food? I booked & now am really unsure ..
"It happens this time of year pretty much every year, but it's not only the Majestics. It happens at other resorts too, but Majestics get many reviews, so we are more likely to see more reports of illness.But, generally, it's not the food, it's usually due to illness from guests being spread around.Do what you can to protect yourself against these issues, probiotics, etc. Many people even take dukoral as well.Not much you can do about illness spread around by other guests.Edited: 7 years ago "
"A lot of illness travels on the charters. People travel sick, the plane is not cleaned properly before others board. The other reason is that people go to these resorts and eat food they would not normally eat at home and they over induldge. Just my two cents."
"Uaual causes are:You brought it wtih you (our last two house guests did this thank you very much) or caught sometihing on the planeYou used tap water some how (tooth brushing????0Too many coconut drinks and coconut water (great laxative)Too much alcoholToo much foodToo much sun, food and alcohol together.I bet this accounts for 98% of the "" illness"" one gets here'BObK"
"If so many people did get ill there would not be such a huge amount of fans of the place and so many returning guests.Both Majestic's are resorts that are bokked fully before most others and for a reason.I loved the place(s), have never gotten ill in punta Cana and would be more than happy to return.Amy"
"As mentioned previously, I would definitely encourage you to take probiotics for a few weeks before traveling and also every day once you're there. Whenever you travel someplace, you will encounter different (not bad) bacteria, which may or may not affect your digestive tract.... everyone's different. Probiotics make your digestive tract a more ""welcoming"" environment for different bacteria that you wouldn't normally encounter, thus allow you to tolerate them more successfully. I'm a firm believer in their effectiveness. Also, it isn't such a bad idea to take a daily Pepto Bismol tab as a preventative measure. If you DO fall ill and have diarrhea, try not to take imodium unless you've been suffering for a day (or even two). Just stay hydrated. Imodium shuts everything down... meaning whatever is inside you that is causing you a problem stays inside you. You really want to get it out, and imodium works counter to that effort."
"what means the Rumor ""many people sick at that resort""???sounds like a very bad researched statement without any grounds to me, as I was there yesterday and i did not see any line of waitiung sick guests at the Doctor's place, but a packed place with happy travelers all around, it did not look like any sick place under quarantine to me.who said they would have many sick guests and what is ""Many"" out of the maybe 1600 weekly guests there?rumors spread well, and keep in mind how many people are sick with such symptoms due Flue/Noro Virus etc etc etc northerner deseases this time of the year and also year around, as the same percentage of those sick people are of course also traveling to the caribbean with all kind of deseases already in 'em whenstarting a vacation, and then of course we have the desease spreaders airports and planes, where hundreds of people use for hours the few available bathrooms, breath forcingly the same bad air full of Germs in such plane.Mike"
"You're right, Mike. Flu has reached epidemic proportions in all but I think two US states. It's really a major health crisis right now."
"that's right poozieny, and it is every year the same at the same time of the year. and it is not something northamerican made, the european countries run their Flues of course the same way.hence at this very same time of the year every year such hoimemade health problems show up in the resort reviews, just that they get their names changed, in most cases they are named ""Food Poisening"". experienced travellers to mass tourism Mekkas like Punta Cana are used to such ""Food Poisening Outbreaks"" this time of the year every year again and again.take your same precautions to stay safe and preventively prepared for the circulating viruses, as you would do at home, and you will not be at higher risk to catch such than you would be at home at places where many people come together, too.happy travelsMikebtw,the most vulnerable persons due such viruses are we Locals, as our immune systems are mostly not prepared to defend our bodies against foreign made viruses."
"Like others said, i really believe we bring it there. I'm from canada, everyone has the damn flu here, yet people still travel - usually can't get their money back.OR, they don't realize they're even sick yet...sometimes you have the bug for a day or so before even feeling anything...and because of the time of year, with so many sick.... you go, and within a day or two, you're sick, and you just point fingers and blame.Honestly, 9 times out of 10 it's people that didn't follow the water rules, or like Mike said, too many coconut drinks (people never realize this one)... drinking, strange food, and too much sun is a recipe for disaster.Be smart, Everything in moderation. Don't over do it. bring typical meds just to be safe. Drink lots of bottled water. Enjoy your vaca :)"
I'm leaving in 6 days to go to ME should I run to the store and start on Probiotics or Pepto or do you believe it may be too late?Edited: 7 years ago 
"who cares, enjoy your vacation"
"You could, we try and eat yogurt daily before we go ( different resort) we eat what we want, don't take any medicines as a preventitive and are fine! Use hand sanitizer. And wash your hand often , also watch the coconut drinks and your alcohol intake , if you don't drink alcohol often at home daily intake at the resort can give you all the symptoms of food poisoning"
Take the probiotics. Take them while you are there also. CVS or Walgreens has them. We take them for 3 months before we travel. Pepto only if needed.
