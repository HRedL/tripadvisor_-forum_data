We’re due to go snorkelling and will use the boats equipment. Is this safe with this virus? Tried googling but can’t find anything . Has anyone been snorkelling since the virus hit
"Hundreds of people go snorkeling on the tour boats every day, why would it be a concern?"
If you go with a quality tour provider such as 100 degrees they have top notch hygiene standards. I would be totally confident with them. Just ask your tour provider how they clean their equipment. Most reviews will give you an idea on the standard of care tour providers take.
"Why do you think, Jim?If the previous wearer was infected and the gear had not been sterilised. I think it could well be problem."
"The Coronavirus can stay live on different surfaces for different amounts of time, however, temperatures above 30 degrees it cannot survive. I personally would be taking my own anti bacterial wipes to clean the equipment I was going to use."
"I agree with Cassnu, if that concerned one needs to take precautions with anything one touches... Door knobs, knife and forks, plates .... I could go on... so why limit concerns to snorkeling masks?  But how do I know snorkeling equipment is cleaned, String Ray, It's because I know many of the staff at two of the main speed boat companies... as some used to be neighbours.When I have done trips, I usually hang around and wait for them to finish... One of the daily jobs is cleaning the snorkels and masks has been in force as long as I the twelve years I have been around Samui or Koh Phangan. . I drive my bike, where as tourists don't see behind the scenes, as they are whisked away by mini bus. I am sure no difference in washing that the Red Baron does. But keep up the scaremongering as you are doing a great job of it across the forum, Sting Ray."
I’d like to thank knives and forks have been thoroughly washed but thought snorkelling equipment was just left until the next passenger used it. In which case it’s a bit concerning. Used them before and never thought until now about the hygiene of it. Think the virus has made people more aware
Because your putting the equipment in your mouth that the previous passenger used. I’m unaware of hygiene with the equipment and never though about it in the past until soneone mentioned it to me
Just make sure to keep the same masks and snorkels during your day trip... If you want to make extra sure bring along your own sanitizer.
"The problem will be not just the mouthpiece or mask, as there may be droplets in the air tube. However, most masks and breathing tubes are stored in salt water, and salt is a natural antibiotic. Liquid soap is also really good way to stop the mask misting, so also helps clean the mask. It is normal that on a tour you keep your mask / breathing tube with you, which would be advisable. Just remember that whilst Covid19 is very contagious the fatality rates are not more than seasonal flu, and the last time there was a flu pandemic was in 2009, and most people will not even realise there was one. Its about being sensible and not panicking! Germs like warm and moist conditions, not hot and dry!There is a shortage of hand sanitizer / wipes in the UK at the moment. A bit like the toilet roll scare in Australia, the UK has had a run on sanitizer when good old soap and water is equally effective!!Edited: 7:43 am, March 13, 2020 "
""" temperatures above 30 degrees it cannot survive. ""Really so how does survive in humans?Why is in hot countries? 11 new cases yesterday in Bangkok. It is Philippines, Singapore and India etc. It can survive but does not spread so quickly. Oh and all 11 cases in Bangkok catch by sharing a drink and cigarette apparently. The virus can survive upto 72 hours on surfaces.Edited: 7:54 am, March 13, 2020 "
"A recent study showed high temperature and high relative humidity significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19. This result is consistent with the fact that the high temperature and high humidity significantly reduce the transmission of influenza:https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm…Accordingly, Thailand, relative to its population, had about 50 times less influenza cases than the US in the past years.Those 11 Thais who got recently infected by a visitor from Hong Kong (By sharing glasses and dope) seem to have not infected any of their 70 friends and relatives who got tested. Nor were the other 4 Thais infected who attended the party but didn’t drink or smoke.In New York on the other, a single person directly infected recently more than 50 people."

Get some sanitizing spray and spray your gear thoroughly before you use it. Let the spray dry on the gear before using it for maximum anti-viral effect.
I would say that you are spot onto be concernedBe safe and take your own Snorkeling equipmentOr use a reputable company to take your Snorkeling toursDo not listen to people when they say why should it be a problem!!!
This thread is a good example of scaremongering. I have been diving for 30 years and every dive shop including those in Thailand inundate masks and snorkels in soap water. That’s done among other things to remove fog from masks.The coronavirus virus is a self-assembled nanoparticle in which the weakest link is the lipid (fatty) bilayer. Soap dissolves the fat membrane and the virus falls apart like a house of cards and becomes inactive.Sanitizing sprays (alcohol) are less effective than soap and there is obviously the danger of alcohol poisoning if sprayed on snorkels.
"Also been diving for 30 years, and have yet to see ANY shop, handle their rental gear in a manner I would feel comfortable using without a good washing first.With today's bugs going around (flu, herpes, HIV, etc etc), I'd recommend all have their own gear. When you go to the dentist, everything used on you comes out of an autoclave............nuff said.As always.........UP2U"
"Well said Chris, it ridiculous the scaremongering going on... People need to think about everything they touch could be contaminated, why the concern with just snorkeling masks??. It's all a bit over the top. People need to take some responsibility for themselves.I was just in Makro, Bophut this morning, the only store I've seen where they are checking temperatures.Sadly for businesses every where, people are going to go broke. I saw as I drove past Angela's Bakery in Maenam, had a liquidation sign on the window, probably going to be the first of many."
"""why the concern with just snorkeling masks??""Let's see....maybe because you sticking the snorkel and all organics on it in your mouth, and breathing anything else in the tube into you body.Along with eye & nose as an entry point for anything that might be in the mask.Seriously fellas....it not brain surgery, but a wee bit of personal hygiene goes a long way. Emphasis on 'personal'.Things you can control, you should control.Edited: 10:00 am, March 14, 2020 "
"Really, Not Me, you have been diving ? Obviously not because your recommendation to use 70% alcohol sanitizer on snorkels and masks is not done. Anywhere in the world. it’s dangerous and may lead to alcohol poisoning. You have already disclosed that you have only been once in Ko Samui many years ago. Why are you posting about things you obviously don’t know anything about? Get a life."
"More BS...and where pray tell did a state that ""use 70% alcohol sanitizer""Think I said alcohol solution (no %) or 50 / 50 bleach. Of course anything you use, will need to be rinsed thoroughly, and would hope any idiot would realize that. If not, they'll notice it as soon as they put the mask on. Them eyes are are sensitive. On the subject of hygiene and use....who hasn't spit in their mask so it doesn't fog up.Think this over......would you lick the inside of a rental mask and snorkel..........might as well, as that the equivalent of using one.Stick to telling people there have only been 2 box jelly stings in the past 8-10 years, though Gov't states 8 in last year. Maybe some idiot would believe that.You guys are a trip.....come to Samui, we need you baht.Yea, I have 100s of dive, but not in the crap vis, fished out Gulf.Have a nice day.Edited: 4:09 am, March 14, 2020 "

"Whilst I certainly do not go in for scaremongering I would not use a rented snorkel and mask during the coronavirus outbreak.The fact that you are putting this kit into your face and mouth, blowing and spitting creates a significant risk of passing on infection.How reliably do these blokes wash the kit, to what standard, what level of scrutiny exists? We know the traditional Thai approach to health and safety....Everyone’s individual choice but a no brainier for me at the moment."
I am shocked that some local expats actually believes that the official numbers for Thailand are true. At least today the government has admitted 32 new cases.Most Thais don’t trust the government and everybody knows that the numbers are false.
"Dennis J, like the Danish government, the Thai government is publishing new cases identified on a daily basis. For all countries it's safe to assume that the real number of infected people is way higher than those tested. However, the number of deaths is a good indicator (1 for Thailand). Based on the average time from catching the virus to dying (17.3 days) , an assumed death rate of 1%, and average doubling time for the coronavirus (6.2), you can calculate how many infected persons there may be at time of that one death: About 800. Or 0,0011% of the population. Denmark has two COVID-19 deaths, so possibly 1600 cases. That's 0,0286% of Denmark's population. So even assuming there are 8 times more cases in Thailand than reported, it's still 25 times more likely to bump into an infected person in Denmark than in Thailand.Edited: 11:14 am, March 15, 2020 "
"No Thai people trust that their government publish the real numbers, but you obviously do.Enough from me."
The Thai government only releases details of cases linked to foreigners and Thais who have posted their illness on social media.Everything else is hidden.
All these scaremongering from people who live in countries who announced that hospitals stop carrying out >all< normal medical procedures (Denmark) and whose supermarkets are overun by panic buyers (UK). Nothing like that happening here.
"Really...nothing like that here...this must be fake news thenhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/ETMMypJXsAUNJyO…https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ETJEpeGWkAEGLJh…https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general…Edited: 12:55 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"Not Me why don’t you limit yourself to Hua Hin where you live? None of your links you post is related to Ko Samui. This is the Ko Samui forum. There are no queues at supermarkets on the island. FYI: Bangkok has 14 Macro markets for 8.3 million people while Ko Samui has 2 for 100,000 inhabitants."
Wow......you are really mis-informed.There goes another Unicorn
"Hi, to answer your question, I think you do need to contact your island tour service provider directly. Most of the tour providers are private, so it's likely they have different way to deal with coronavirus. Some may sterilise the tool, and tbh some may not. I suggest we can also buy the snorkeling in equipment in the Koh Samui (they actually have a diving shop every corner tho) The price is super cheap and its the safest way.Feel free to inbox me or visit my profile for more question"
"Chris .... Were you referring to Thailand or Samui, as you listed 2 'countries', so the country here is having people stocking up / panic shopping. Specify next time if referring to just Samui.You brought the subject up.......not me.But here is a thought, if supply lines are disrupted, remotely possible, who / where do you think the disruption will fall ?Krung Thep where the main warehouses are & 8+ million customers, or the very low number customer locations, logistically further away.If you don't want to have a discussion, then don't start one.Edited: 6:01 am, March 16, 2020 "
"Agree with Chris, no queues at supermarkets. Makro in Bophut was the only store checking temperatures. Makro was about a normal mid day crowd, yesterday. Only one misinformed member on this thread, as usual. Stick Hau Hin, Not Me."
