I'm looking to book a trip just as soon as I read some reviews of travelers going in June and July however I do not want to book if you must self quarantine for 14 day upon returning. Does anyone know if this is the case? Thank you
Ignore that type comment until you see it from official sources.This is a bad flu...not the bubonic plague.The idea that people should quarantine two weeks before and/or after a trip to Mexico is asinine.
"As of now, the U.S. govt isn't requiring mandatory quarantine upon returning from Mexico. I do know that it is suggested by the CDC that you do self-quarantine upon coming home from any international travel - no matter the countryhttps:/…after-travel-precautions.htmlBtw, it wasn't hard to look this up...I just did a quick 20 second Google search...Below is a link to the entry/exit requirements of U.S. citizens to Mexico and other COVID-19 procedures/info relating to Mexico. The U.S. Dept of State will be your friend. I highly recommend that you sign up for the STEP program so you can get updates from the embassy...https:/…Edited: 8:03 pm, May 23, 2020 "
"thanks for the info, but I don't know if the CDC has updated since restrictions are being lifted."
"I think the quarantine suggestion by the CDC is completely independent of restrictions being lifted. Here's the link to the STEP program by the U.S. Dept of State. You should definitely sign up asap so you will get daily updates of any changes that would affect your travel plans. It is freehttps://step.state.gov/Also, just to let you know that air travel isn't restricted between the U.S. and Mexico right now. That non-essential travel restriction only refers to land travel between the U.S. and Mexico. Air travel isn't affected. Canada is following its own restrictions however. I would also like to apologize if my previous post seemed a bit snippy. That wasn't my intention :-)"
If the US government made such a quarantine a requirement then air travel to those non-US countries from the USA would be near zero.It is far past the point where fear over this virus is warranted. Actually there was never a reason to be fearful even though responses have been driven by irrational hysteria.
"You should, however, check with your employer. I know 3 people personally who have been told that if they travel internationally for the next several months, they will be required to sel quarantine at home for 14 days without pay. So a 7 day trip becomes 21 days off work with the last 14 unpaid. None of these 3 people will be traveling internationally for a while.Edited: 9:25 pm, May 23, 2020 "
Concur with the employer part. It seems like that was mentioned multiple times during the swine flu period.
"I agree with CO_pilot that Covid19 is just the latest (severe) version of the flu to come out of China. However please self-quarentine for 14 days BEFORE you go to Mexico, so as not to be an asymptomatic carrier and contribute to an already overwhelmed (Mexican) medical system. Safe travels. ¡Diviertanse!"
"CP's attitude is the reason I am happy the US/Canada border is closed.Edited: 10:14 pm, May 23, 2020 "
"CP clearly looks beyond the entertainment-level ""news"" media and sees a different picture. He's not the only one with that opinion.No personal sniping please."
"Currently where I live we would need to absolutely do a 14 day quarantine even if we went within Canada. So I would check with your State rules as it may vary from state to state.Edited: 8:51 am, May 24, 2020 "
Bad flu ..Unreal.!https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-835…
The Daily Mail? Why not also consult The National Enquirer while you are at it?IT is a good suggestion to check with your employer as to what their policies are. I traveled to Mexico in May 2009 during the swine flu and had to get see my Dr. and get a note I was OK to return to work. However this flu has gotten a lot more media coverage.
"agree, within limits....this is not Steven King's Capt trips from The Stand...but it is a easily spread flu on steroids! having said that, testing...testing...TESTING should be the goal here, if you get a testing regimen going with fast results (the promise is soon testing with results in 15 minutes, then it becomes exactly the same as going thru immigration. The resort employees would need to be tested weekly (at a minimum) soon as that is all in place, should be go fever for EVERYONE!!!"
"If they were accurate tests, maybe. But they're not; they took shortcuts developing it (the RT-PCR test), because emergency. The current tests produce false negatives (bad for disease control) and false positives (bad for YOU). The media won't talk about this. One false positive will wreck your whole vacation, through no fault of your own.I'm not getting on a plane if an unreliable test is mandatory."
Agree Viajero. There is much more to science beyond what you see on the news or facebook.
"""I'm not getting on a plane if an unreliable test is mandatory.""I agree but such a test may not even be planned. I would not worry about it at this point. Obviously if you can wait until things have been open a while before making reservations, that could help. That is my plan."
"It’s possible that co pilots comments are one of the most ignorant things I have read on here on covid. How many people have died in such a short time?As someone else I’m glad US Canada border is closed with his attitude.Edited: 6:54 am, May 27, 2020 "
"Timinkw, wait until I submit a post in the Cozumel forum. I will post a link to it when finished."
">> The idea that people should quarantine two weeks before and/or after a trip to Mexico is asinine. <<Any broad statement like that is asinine. Any time you are in a confined space with other people who are not wearing masks you should self-quarantine to prevent the possible spread of this “bad flu” to others. If that doesn’t appeal to you then stay at hone as recommended and keep us safe.Common sense should prevail in this new normal, not selfish motives...Edited: 9:03 am, May 27, 2020 "
Timinkw...you speak the truth.
"as others have mentioned, OP should definitely check with their employer(s), as it is a rule with many companies, including my own, at least for now, that upon your return from any travel out of the country, you will have to quarantine at home before allowed to return to work. I won't be able to go anywhere until they change or lift that restriction as I only get five weeks a year and won't be wasting any of my vacation days on self-isolation.FTR, in Canada you ARE legally required by the Quarantine Act to self-isolate at home for 14 days after returning from a trip. It's mandatory and people flouting it can be fined up to 750K or up to 6 months imprisonment.https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/…Don't at least some US states have similar laws?"
"nevermind, I looked it up. Interesting.https:/…"
""" .. One false positive will wreck your whole vacation""So will a false negative.No test is 100% fool proof. Biostatistics 101."
Do you have to quarantine if u are returning from Cancun Mexico in October??
"No one knows what will happen tomorrow, much less how things will be in October. You will need to wait until we get closer to that date.FYI...Hawaii did just get added to our New York State Quarantine list today..."
"That's for sure - who knows what will be happening in October?Does Hawaii currently require a 14-day quarantine if returning from a trip to Mexico? If so, the odds are high that this will still be in place in October given how COVID-19 is evolving in Mexico. However, impossible to say for sure."
You would have to check with the Hawaii Department of Health to see what they are requiring. Most US states are not requiring you to quarantine for visiting Mexico though.
