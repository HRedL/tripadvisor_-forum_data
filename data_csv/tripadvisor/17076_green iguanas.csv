"just seen that they are killing all the green iguanas on Grand Cayman, is this true? I always loved seeing them in the trees etc, I'm deeply shocked that they are being killed, and I will not travel to such a place anymore."
The iguanas are an epidemic. The population needs to be controlled. It is not to be mean. Long overdue
"Lovediving, can you provide us with a link to this information?"
I believe they have exterminated a half million so far. They are an invasive species that threatens the success of the blue iguanas
https:/…
"The greens are a threat to the native blue iguanas, and to the environment as well. The 600,000 that have been culled is less that half the population. An.island the size of GC cannot support 1,200,000 iguanas."
They are not indigenous to Cayman so have no natural predators here. Unfortunately that means their population has gotten completely out of control and they have become a threat to some other indigenous animal and plant species.
"I have defended the sea turtle population in many, many posts but the green iguanas like everyone said are an invasive species just like the Lion Fish. They have basically wiped out the indigenous blue iguana population (along with a lot of help from dogs). What Grand Cayman is doing with the green iguanas is a good thing.B."
"The Cayman Islands have a excellent program, the Blue Iguana Recovery Program, which has rescued the native Blue Iguana from extinction. If anyone is interested: http://www.blueiguana.ky/. they have an interesting tour when you are on the island and they are worthy of a donation if you are not."
"It is all too common an occurrence for perspectives on and opposition to officially supported programs involving wildlife to be more influenced by sentimentality rather than by the science and intellectual honesty that should underpin evidence-based policy-making to ensure conservation of biodiversity. The OP's threat of an economic sanction (""... will not travel to such a place anymore"") is an example of opposition arising from such a perspective in a sentimental ""rush to judgement"". Hopefully after being informed by all the explanatory responses in this thread, the OP would not hold to that same position any more.Here's a bit more on the negative impacts of green iguanas in Cayman:The green iguana population, as pointed out above, is not native to the Cayman Islands. The blue iguana on the other hand ONLY exists naturally in this one island Grand Cayman. Because the green iguana (aka ""marine iguana"") is a fairly recent invasive species with no natural predators and has been rapidly reproducing at prolific rates to well over a million, and is now encroaching on the blue iguana habitat, the green iguana overpopulation became a great environmental concern in Grand Cayman. They have voracious appetites and they threaten several native species not only the blue iguana, but also many species of plants that sustain many other species of wildlife. Green iguanas also damage or destroy plants and crops that are needed for agricultural food production, and they damage or destroy many shrubs and flowers used in landscaping.I hope this helps in gaining better-informed perspectives!"
"Instead of killing them, why can’t they be caught and transported somewhere else where they would be appreciated? Or if they were going to be killed, why not use the skin and meat etc? I understand the destruction they do on GC, but I am not a fan on just killing them off."
"Tukka serves them. There was talk about a company setting up a processing facility, nott sure if that happened. There is also someone on the island who is making jewelry with the skin. But, I believe the majority are going to the landfill. Very cost prohibitive to try to trap and relocate.Edited: 1 year ago "
"I am sorry you fell my post was based on sentimentality. The broader point is how and who defines what is native and non-native? This definition is seldom black and white. However, individuals / authorities will often make an interpretation based on beliefs and not on an evidence based policy. In this case, I see no scientific publications underpinned by data and evidence but drivers including populism, a desire to have a clean swimming pool and an attempt to justify the slaughtering of a million iguanas. Your argument that the killing the green iguanas will provide habitat for the blue iguanas is uninformed. Both species have very different requirements and are spatially separated. The real challenge for the blue iguanas is human population growth, tourism and over development. Unfortunately significant blue iguana mortality is due to road kill and domestic dogs and cats. Eradication of the green iguana population (which is an unrealistic objective anyway) is not going to have any impact positive or negative on the blue iguana population. It is purely and simply an excuse to justify a perverse view of “fun”."
Enlighten me then. You are saying I/we are uninformed about the blue iguanas. I would love to hear your argument. 1.5 million iguanas is an unsustainable population for an island that size. I have a real hard time with your argument that this cull is happening for fun. That is actually pretty insulting.Edited: 1 year ago 
Maybe we should just leave the lionfish alone as well?
"Perverse fun.Read the following article. If you disagree it is your right, but to call the Cayman Department of Environment zoosadists is a bit strange.https:/…"
"The definition of native vs non-native is very black and white. Here are 17 in your home country. https:/… Whether a non-native species is invasive or whether or not it is damaging native species can be a little less clear. Also, not really sure how the blue and greens are spatially separated. The greens are everywhere.... hence the culling. B."
"To the OP, it's easy enough, don't come back."
"Each tourist needs to make a decision as to where they spend their money, based on what a country has to offer.If programs like the lionfish culling and green iguana program are offensive to you, then please don't spend your tourist dollars on the location. Vote with your wallet. Most environmentalists agree that both programs are necessary for the island's habitat. Both the greens and the lionfish have been a rapidly-spreading pest over the past few years and I am glad that they are being kept under some degree of control"
"I understand that everyone has different opinions but to claim that you will not travel to a country on the basis that a cull deemed necessary by their DOE is too upsetting, it amazes me that such an individual could reside in a country where hunting is regularly done for fun. I am not commenting pro or con on the actual activities, but rather on what appears to to be a very ironic position given the circumstances. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_and_…"
"I always enjoy seeing the iguanas while in GC. I was surprised to see this thread and then to learn, after a little research, that this has been going on for a few years now. However as an infrequent visitor to the island, I feel in no way qualified to comment on the merits/or not of a cull. I find it interesting that in Belize they have a project to encourage the green iguana population that has been severely reduced due to over hunting."
Green Iguanas are native to Belize.B.
"I just ran over a green iguana this morning, it was either hit it or hit the car in the oncoming lane.I cant cook so I left it for the chickens."
Just don't hit the chickens. :) B.
Some restaurants do serve the green iguana on their menu. The local hunters sell them to the restaurants.
There was an initiative to be able to sell locally harvested iguana and they were imported to test the market with customers but unless something has changed local iguana is not on the menu. There are regulations regarding the processing of meat product. I have never seen local iguana on a menu. Where did you find it?
"The only place that I know of with Green Iguana on the menu is Tukka - their dish is called ""Cayman Tree Chicken"", but they make it plain that it is green iguana, along with the slogan ""If you can't beat 'em, eat 'em""."
I believe they are imported. Rumor is that they wanted to start using meat from local iguanas. It would be nice if that happens.
