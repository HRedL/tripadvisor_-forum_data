"Hello,I am thinking of going to Milan with my 10 year old daughter for 4 days in mid April. Looking to know what makes sense to do beyond the Duomo, the shopping gallery and the castle (these 3 things too all the travel guides, and probably have million tourists roaming these places). Also, thinking of taking a train either to Bergamo or Turin for one full day.Already thinking of the science museum.My daughter likes food and cooking classes, loves interesting/funky stores. Maybe a zoo (if it's good)."
"""Looking for ideas"" - Plenty of ideas for visiting Milan with children in the following previous forum threads:- ""Milan with young kids"" [ https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18784… ]- ""Spots / Activities for kids and children"" [ https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18784… ] - Also don't forget there is a ""Guide to Milan for Families"" on Tripadvisor by Stef [ https:/…Guide-g187849-k93-Milan_Lombardy.html ].For ""interesting/funky stores"" ... probably a number of spots in Milan for this, including... ""I am visiting Milan with my 16 year old daughter... For younger funkier fashion then maybe try the Corso di Porta Ticinese south of the city...""

Hi. I will also be traveling to Milan with my kids in mid April. My daughter is 11 and boys are 8. Have you found any Intersting sites or parks? My kids love playgrounds.
"""any Intersting sites or parks?"" - I guess no one has added any new ones to those already within the links provided above. Hope you'll find something there that suits."
"I would definitely book refundable travel as the Corona Virus cases have doubled in 1 day and the Duomo, Museums, Churches, Sports, and Theatres are closed. The USA has declared today that it will spread in the USA- see the CDC article belowhttps:/…https:/…cases-in-us.html"
