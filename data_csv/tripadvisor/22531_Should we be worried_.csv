"Leave for st Thomas this week. Should we cancel or be worried? How’s the food situation? How’s the hospital situation? We are young and healthy , just don’t want to be Quarantined on an island that isn’t prepared."
I expressed my opinion about food/supermarket supplies on this thread:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g14740…The hospital is prepared and as yet we have no confirmed cases of the virus. More than likely it'll be on our shores in the next week or two but right now the likelihood of any sort of quarantine is extremely slim.
Correction: One case has been confirmed but it's not been revealed on which island.https:/…
Sounds good . Thank you !

It really makes not much difference on which island the confirmed case is. The Governor chose not to reveal which island in order to protect the patient's privacy but the Consortium chose to broadcast it. Cases were fully expected here.
Are places starting to shut down?
"Schools have been closed as of tomorrow. Just as on the mainland, businesses are being encouraged to create ""social distancing"" in the workplace where possible and some businesses are moving to their employees working remotely from the home.Restaurants so far are open. There may be some changes made to the ferry services between STT and STJ as in reducing number of passengers on any one trip and residents are being asked to use the ferries only if it's necessary.Supermarkets had a bit of a panic run over the weekend but I was out today, the shelves were all restocked and customer traffic was normal.Cruise ships have of course cancelled for 30 days so this is bound to affect many particularly daytime businesses.That's about it for today anyway!"
"Thank you so much for your quick updates, it’s very much appreciated! We don’t fly out till Thursday from NY. Heard the airports are crazy for people flying out of NY, so who knows. If now, we will take a voucher and visit paradise in late November!"
Canceled our trip unfortunately. Don’t want to come if everything is shutting down. Also heard rumor that anyone from NY or CA is being quarantined for 14 days when they get to the island. Bummmer.
"<< ""Also heard rumor that anyone from NY or CA is being quarantined for 14 days when they get to the island."" >>OK... where did you hear such a rumor?While it's probably not a bad idea (though I'd add Washington State to the list too) propagating rumors isn't doing anybody any good. A grocery store two towns away almost had a riot yesterday due to a ""i heard a rumor"" post on FaceBook suggesting that the store in question was closing their doors at 8pm and remaining closed for three weeks.Edited: 3:10 pm, March 17, 2020 "
Our travel plans are to arrive on island 3/24 but where hearing rumors that local restaurants are going to be shut down and only doing take out is this true or just rumor
"Heard it from someone that had recently traveled. Can you confirm that this ISNT true? And many grocery stores here in the mainland are having early hours, so I wouldn’t be surprised if the island followed suit. Like how they shut down schools there and what not."
"<< ""Can you confirm that this ISNT true? "" >>It's incumbent upon the person MAKING a claim to support its veracity... not the person questioning it to falsify it."
"When repeating rumors, the onus is on you to show some source. It's not up to other people to disprove it. That's facebook level discourse, do better. People need facts."
"RPJ, we must have been typing at the same time. I make lots of typos though, and constantly have to edit..."
"Many of the restaurants are right now adhering to the Governor's mandate of no more than 50 people gathered at any meeting place. They have also taken the advice of the health authorities in taking extra sanitation measures; and are offering take-out (and some of them even delivery) of family and individual meals. None has as yet closed down but they're all working hard to keep business going as much as possible in order to serve the community and, of course, keep their employees on the payroll."
Look at what's happening everywhere. Very sadly we aren't coming down this year... nothing to do with Wuhan virus but more from 35ish children and their children messing with liquidity. That said I'm in Ohio with Bluewater and run restaurants. As soon as there is a couple of cases the Government WILL shut down dine in for restaurants... take out only...it's going to happen in STT. That said if I was going 5/4 as usual I would go.. only danger is on plane. Can't think of a better place to distance myself than on Sapphire. Good luck everyone!!!
"This terrible cornonavirus is named: COVID-19.Please use the appropriate name.Let's not fuel bigotry and put Chinese or Asian - Americans, or others, at risk.This situation is bad enough as it is."
"Regardless the label it's still a coronavirus, not a cornonavirus and what on this thread prompted you to bring up bigotry and ""Chinese or Asian-Americans"" into the mix? Most confusing."
"The new PC culture has us avoiding calling it Wuhan virus forgetting many other viruses are named after where they came from. West Nile, Ebola...we didn't complain then, but the new folks in charge of the feelings department on the internet have rejected Wuhan Virus."
"Good catch on my coronAvirus typo!I was responding to Post 17.My response stems from a post, on another forum, written by a person, who identified themselves as Asian. Stating that they were very uncomfortable hearing derogatory statements being made, within earshot, about them,... As if they were the cause of this pandemic."
"Too late to edit/add.The use of any other term, besides Coronavirus which may lead to COVID-19 disease, can only perpetuate the anxiety already felt by Asians.Yes, I care very much about the feelings of others.That is why I posted in response to 17Edited: 8:57 pm, March 17, 2020 "
https://viconsortium.com/vi-coronavirus/virg…governor put a ban on 50 people or more in one place and if residents didn’t abide by it then he would put a curfew in place.
Thank you!
"We are to leave on Tuesday 3/24, please let us know if restaurants close and or go to delivery which would be great also.In addition if grocery stores start having minimal supplies. Are there less tourists there WSU’s to Pandemic?"
<< “ We are to leave on Tuesday 3/24.” >> Seriously?<< “Let us know if restaurants close and or go to delivery which would be great also.” >>Yeah... it’s gonna be great.
"KaraH, many restaurants are closing or else cutting back their hours with some offering family and individual take-outs. Supermarkets remain well stocked, and with container shipping still proceeding as usual they don't foresee any shortages in the immediate future but everything is day by day right now.You may be well advised to see if you can re-book your accommodation for a later date once things get back to normal. Without the cruise ship calls and with the mass of visitor cancellations, there is much less to offer visitors. Live music events have been cancelled island-wide. Ferry service to St John may well be restricted soon to accommodate the government's mandate that no more than 50 people gather at any one time; in the meantime the public is asked to only use the ferry service if necessary. The BVI as of tomorrow has banned all visitors from entering the territory so there'll be no day trips by ferry or charter to those islands for the immediate future.We would very much love to welcome you to the islands but you may find it rather restricting right now in all areas."
Relax.... it's not racist overtones it is the facts..the virus came from there and the PRC is trying to convince the world it came from America...are you ok with that or do you think we should deal in facts. If it came from Nottingham Forest it would be the Nottingham Flu... would that be xenophobic??
"A third case has now been confirmed so we have one on St Croix and two on St Thomas/St John. More are anticipated.Edited: 7:47 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"Thank you! This is what we are living now;)We like it quiet, love to basically enjoy the beautiful nature, stunning beaches and have a few dinners."
"Kara, I hope that I'm mis-reading your comments here. If you haven't figured it out, you should clearly cancel your vacation. Two islands over, on PR, it's essentially on lock down. One island (chain) the other direction, the BVI's are doing basically the same ting. The USVI's are likely to do the same, eventually. Seems like it would be a great place to be stuck, until you're in that position. That's saying nothing of the risk that you bring the virus with you. Be responsible. Do the right thing. Cancel your vacation.Edited: 10:38 am, March 19, 2020 "
"<< ""Thank you... We like it quiet"" >>As the line from that Simon & Garfunkel song goes...""Still a man hears what he wants to hear... and disregards the rest."""
