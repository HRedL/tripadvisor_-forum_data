"HiI had to ask this!! Because we do have somethings that we don't like!! This could be the shortest topic on TA but at least it does show others that we do not look and see the world through rose tint glasses.I am sure that there are many things that irrate and annoy us but we simply cannot change the way things are so, therefore we have to live with it, and infact we just get on with it or we simply adjust and get used to it, ""why"" it is because we cannot change it, it is simply the way things are!! ""of course I mean this in the best possible taste""!!So here goes......My least favourite thing is the roads, in particular the ones at Palma Rima junction, Sennegambia and Turntable!! I think these roads are difficult to cross and you take your life in your hands trying to negotiate them!!!Not only are they busy but they are often in an appalling state, and further more the sides of the roads are full of divets and pots holes and you have to take care not to trip or fall!! Infact the most annoying thing about this is that if your a walker like we are, then you spend much of your time looking to the ground because one step wrong and you can injure yourself ""I am an expert on this I can tell you""!I have many other least favourite things but I am hoping some of you will post yours!!Many thanks and best regardsBreeze"
taxi trips at night...not for the faint hearted through tanji...
"Having to spray deet on us and it corroding our shoes, also not having enough goodies for everyone in the village My husband says his least favourite thing is.......he can't think of any......oh of course the very occasional warm julbrewEdited: 6 years ago "
to much Hassel when takeing a nice stroll on the Beach lovely country lovely people but what a pain !
"HiAnother thing I really hate but we don't use it anymore is spraying your room on a night with Bop spray it is truly toxic and awful and I am sure the insects are used to it now!! They do get immune to these things you know!!I am sorry to say we take Raid the one that kills mosquito and other flying/crawling things it may add extra weight in our case but in my opinion it works better than Bop, Where ever it is sprayed if it up in the air then the particles of moisture then land on the floor and you can see many dead hitch hikers on the floor of your balcony or room, where ever you spray you see the evidence the next morning!! And...... It doesn't make you gag like Bop does so to me it is worth it!!!Breeze"
The fact that they don't get we are not all millionaires
That sure certainty that whenever you don't know the local price for an item you will be charged twice as much for being a toubab. Sometimes it just puts you off buying things.
The flight back to UK!
The departure lounge at the airport!!
Hate the hassle later at night from the bums and taxi drivers rounding the corner at the top of the strip by the craft market. Our friends who are here with us on their first visit felt very intimidated !
waiting ages for the waiters to hand you your bill.
I hate bumping into Lamin from reception at the hotel and never recognising him.

"Being forced to shake too many hands. Well, you're never really forced are you, but do many visitors refuse the proferred hand?"
"The Money, I'm sure it's an epidemic waiting to happen."
"the roads and drivers,"
Power Cuts !
Most of the people
loganplacethats not a very nice thing to say is it.now go away quickly
"Thought it was a site to give your honest opinion which is what lm doing, once again if something isnt liked the bullies come out.."
Rude pushy people both local and visitors!
"The money exchanges, I hate them as there are always a few people loitering about outside including beggars!!When you go inside there is the teller behind the iron desk with bars on but...... who are the people that are just sat on chairs at your side of the counting, just watching you change your money up!!That annoys me alot and makes me nervous!!!BreezeEdited: 6 years ago "
"Umm, Err, a, Have to think about That...!!!Oh, Gwanny Nicking Consuela, I'll Have to Walk or get Taxi's.. :-)''.. Rich....."
By far the ATM machines! They don't give our enough money to pay our hotel bill! On our last few days we usually end up going round many! Guess the moral of the story is take more cash out and stop eating steak!!
GMT & the length of time it sometimes takes to get even the simplest thing done!
"Green taxi drivers. Get more hassle from them than bumsters these days. Last trip one tried to rip me off with a crazy price, then agreed to my price and spent the whole journey telling me I was no good for The Gambia and should go home. 2 other similar problems last trip made me determined never to use them again. Another decided to pick up his ""mate"" on the way to my destination - an absolute NO NO!! thats when you get real problems! Many of them are lazy and their attitude stinks. There are exceptions, but my experiences last trip was very off putting.RgdsHaydn"
Dogs and bumsters
Rude tourists who think they own the place and treat the staff like rubbish. One time at kombo this older man kept snapping his fingers and saying you there get me this. No please thank you.
"1. Power cuts. 2. ""some of the people""...I have made many good friends over the years, but also some I thought were friends turned out not to be when they don't get what they want ..Dr Jeckle and Mr Hyde springs to mind with some of them, being soooo nice until they realise u are not an easy touch!!! ...."
"Hello , the same as Haydn , green taxi drivers , especially when there is a gaggle of them and one has to run their gauntlet of nastiness .One member in a PM referred to them as the tourist taxi mafia, very apt Rgds Bruff"

"Aw come on Ric, Consuela is like Granny, needs to keep moving or she seizes up! She's had her seat welded today (consuela not granny), tyres blown up and treated to some proper oil not that thick diesel gunk everyone chucks in regardless. No one loves Consuela more than Granny :) Just thought of another least favourite thing : the absence of loo seats in bar toilets or ones that skitter sideways when you perch on them trapping yer bum."
"The Tourist Area, too Much High Prices..If I am in Lamin and other Parts of The Real Gambia, I can get food and drink about 25% to 75% Cheaper.And the Food as Just as good in The Tourist Area.''.. Rich......."
"how funny.....that was one of my favourite things....I guess I'm a pretty tactile person by nature...But I liked all the handshakes all day, every day."
"Loo seats that wont stay lifted. Gambian plumbers have no idea! African Village, Ocean Bay. Even new swanky loo inside GT Bank in Basse. Had to prop the seat and lid with the inevitable toilet water bottle (how does that bottle/kettle work?). Ugh!"
Driving through serrekunda to get to Talinding to drop a friend offat 11-30 tonight.yoi think its bad during the day.Mmm its childs play compared to the evening.

Leaving Gambia when Going back to UK...!!!!!''.. Rich........
"The dirty, smelly bank notes - especially the smalls."
How about .....The big cockroaches that hide in dark places in the hotel corridors and worse still they get in your room and.... That flippen elusive lizard that gets into your room and you can see it out of the corner of your eye but your not fast enough to catch it!!!Breeze
People on there second visit thinking they know more about TG than the Gambians!!
"Great place, spoilt by people not allowing you to walk around without a local.Old white men & women with a young Gambian of the opposite sex in tow.Only been once, doubt if we will go back.NeilAmanda"
"Breeze - I never complain about having a lizard in the room, a smallish gecko that is - not a full size monitor! A few times to Goa I shared my room with geckos. Due to them I had no problems with cockroaches, beetles etc.... just well fed geckos."

"Sorry should have said post 43,"
My gripe is being harassed by beach sellers when I am trying to have a quiet romantic moment with my husband watching the sunset. Just because I am polite doesn't mean I want you to sit with me and tell me your life story! I am more than happy to listen during the day and buy most things but not when the sun is setting!!
"Haven't been for a few years, after 5 visits the wife won't return. I agree with many of the gripes but still found the place intoxicating.just back from Sri Lanka, the countryside was amazing but give me the Gambia every time"
"Glyndwyer theres a thread l started about your one favourite thing in the Gambia if you want to add something on there, l fear this least favourite list is growing too long hahaa"
"Can't find draught fosters, it's such a pain."
Can't find Fosters? Try the river water. Could even be better!
