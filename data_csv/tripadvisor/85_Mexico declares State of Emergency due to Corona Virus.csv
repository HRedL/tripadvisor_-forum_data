"“Businesses ordered to send employees home, continue paying them“I’m wondering how restaurants, small privately owned hotels and such with no business can continue to pay laid off employees."
If I remember correctly about half of locals are working for themselves in the informal economy . What happens to these if they are not able to go about how ever they make their living ? No one is going to pay them or send them money.
"Planning to visit Mexico in July, fingers crossed the world will be healing from this virus by then"
"TravelerNewYork and Robert, I wonder the same thing.Some of the small businesses are staffed by family so that will be a benefit as there won't be any true employees to pay. Of course, they still won't have money to pay their bills and buy food if their businesses are closed for a month. I wonder if this declaration will cause CFE (the power company) to change their position. I read a few days ago where Aguakan (the water company) stayed they would not cut water service to anyone who cannot pay timely through this. But CFE stated that they were not extending any due dates to pay your power bill and were proceeding business as usual in terms of disconnection for non-payment."
I hope CFE reconsiders that pretty heartless stand at a time like this.
"The overall numbers here are far less than other countries when these orders were given. By that fact, Mexico has done *better* than most other countries. (Russia and Belgium are the only two who restricted things sooner)"
"The overall numbers are linked to actual testing. The fewer tests, the lower the number. So it's kind of hard to say whether Mexico is doing something better or worse than other countries and vice versa."
"Even trying to determine the number of people who have actually died FROM covid-19 can be difficult. Italy, for instance, counts as a covid-19 death anybody who dies WITH covid-19 even though they may actually have died FROM one or more pre-existing conditions, called ""pre-morbidities"" in the article.https:/…"
"The Covid virus exacerbates co-morbidities, it could be that although the patient died from heart disease or kidney disease, had they not contracted Covid19, they may have lived for a year or more. IMHO that article is not completely factual. We can trust almost nothing reported in foreign countries right now-- we cant even trust our own reporters."
"You both raise a good point. Normally patients deaths' are coded according to the cause of death. So in many countries (like the US), many people die of ketoacidosis or kidney failure when really diabetes is the underlying factor. In Italy, they're allowing to determine Covid-19 to be the cause of death when in other countries the cause of death would be ""other"".This is the reason why we hear of so many Coronavirus deaths in Italy.Edited: 7:37 am, April 02, 2020 "
"With only 10,000 tests done in Mexico, we have no idea how widespread the virus has become. New York, for example, has done over 200,000 tests as of two days ago."
"That's speculation, Dale. It's like comparing the tests done in CDMX vs Paraguay. New York City is the virus hub of the planet. JFK should have closed since last year.With 23,000,000 people that's hardly 0.8% tested. See how numbers work?"
