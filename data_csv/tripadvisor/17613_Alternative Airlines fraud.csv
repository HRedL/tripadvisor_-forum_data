"Plan to travel via Caribic to Latin America. Thus came across for 1st time this alternativeairlines.company. Any useful for me as former airline staff with lots of airline experience. Read some disturbing remarks/comments though still believe fares are compatible and most of all good selection of various carriers. Any feedback - pos. or neg. - very welcome as intent to book within next few days. Prices keeping going up every day anyway. Strange enough could not look at business class fares for my overnight flt home...No darknet business I do hope as want to travel carefree all the way. Finally, reckon the offered good UK language. Besides appreciate the clearly visible extra costs and most of all the free cnl/rebkg possiblities."
"Best way of carefree travel is to book directly with the airlines. It is so much easier not having an e trap layer of charges, terms and conditions to deal with. You can buy refundable tickets from the airline. They cost more. An agent can only sell you refundable tickets if that is the type of fare bought from the airline."
"What a great selection of airlines they offer, including BMI, BMIbaby, Air Berlin, Eastern Airlines, US Airways, Malev and plenty of others.'Besides appreciate the clearly visible extra costs and most of all the free cnl/rebkg possiblities.' Did you read the not so fine print about the cancellation and rebooking? You'll pay a fee to Alternative Airlines for the privilege of this but 'airline charges will apply depending on the fare rules' and these latter will not be 'free' since this ticket flogger isn't likely to book semi- or fully-flexible tickets.One would think that 'former airline staff with lots of airline experience' would cross the street to avoid this lot, but then again it may be a slow day at Altenative Airlines House and staff need to keep busy."
"I hope any airline staff I fly with has better command of grammar, English, sentence construction and gibberish avoidance than that poster."

"Hello,I have been trying to contact alternative airlines but I cannot reach them. I have called the phone number provided more than 20 times and it simply doesn't work, it won't even ring. I've emailed and had one reply. However this is an emergency situation and must contact them immediately and cannot seem to do so. It would be helpful to hear back from Alternative Airlines so I can find a way to get in touch with them in situations like this. Please respond as soon as possible.Thank You"

No United States business phone number? Perhaps registery?

No it was you...it was having problems accepting payment and when it finally went through it altered the date of our departure.
"Once again, this is the Trip Advisor Air Travel forum, it is a community forum of volunteers that try to assist travellers. As far as I know no one who posts here works for Alternative Airlines (not even Grahame_B, who I am sure will correct me if I am mistaken). You will need to contact the company directly.On this page: https://www.alternativeairlines.com/contact if you scroll down there is a ""Contact Us"" section. They may also have a page on the Book of Faces or perhaps something called Twitter. I've no idea how that works, but I have had success in the past contacting companies (reputable ones) via Facebook."
Trust me. It wasn't me. Some people should not be let loose on the internet without supervision.I still maintain that the problem resides with skihawaii.Edited: 2 years ago 
"Earlier this year tried to find some organisation that could make domestic bookings for me with Aerolineas Argentina. I cannot remember how I was put in touch with Alternative Airlines, but it was a simple matter of an e-mail to provide the firm with the itinerary. Within two days I had the quote which I considered most reasonable. Buenos Aires to Mendoza - Mendoza to Salta via a short stop at Cordoba - Salta to Iquazu - Iguazu to Buenos Aires. All flights were by Aerolineas or Astral (seemed to me to be almost the same firm) All flights were on time with the exception of a 20 minute delay in one of the longest legs (Mendoza - Cordoba - Salta - Iguazu) which I consider quite acceptable.The time of one of the flights was changed (by 10 minutes) and I was notified immediately to see if I needed to make changes to the iterinary (which I didn't).Many of the domestic/international airports are undergoing change, but run faultlessly. If only our regional airports here in the UK ran so smoothly.Flights were amasingly well managed and orderly by minimal ground staff. Booking in was so simple. Presenting a passport was all that was needed. No tickets seemed necessary. It all worked like clockwork. I was astonished. Maybe I was just lucky, but on the basis of my experience I would have no reason in not recommending Alternative Airlines for internal domestic flights within the Argentine."
"Hi, I have booked with them, opted for free cancellation (extra fee of 23 pounds), then had to change the flight one day earlier. The fee for changing was 130 pounds, for a ticket costing 160 pounds. Free cancellation is just a story...Edited: 2 years ago "
"Chris H, how did you add on your baggage?"
Do not book a US airline with this company. I was charged an additional baggage fee of $54 on top of the ticket price that the airline said already included the baggage fee.
Now Alternative is saying that it wasn't a baggage fee but a fee to use PayPayl of approximately %16!
"I do have very strange and horrible experience with Alternative airlines. I had booked a flight ticket from Algiers to Setif on 1st Oct'18 night for travel to setif on 2nd Morning. Amount was deducted, invoice generated, confirmation received but eticket not received even after flight took off. I checked with algerian airlines and no ticket was issued from their side. I had to make a new booking with them 1 hour before flight take off time( not to be mentioned that i made several call and sent email but they work from 8 am to 8 pm only.)Next day i receive email that they could not book ticket because of payment issue though my money got deducted and invoice generated. Now I am waiting for refund.The event is strange because after I entered my credit card detail in that particular website and payment processed, somebody else tried to use my credit card detail after two hour to process payment of 10 times my ticket value which fortunately declined by my bank. I have firm believe that security of the website is compromised so my credit card detail is been accessed by someone else"

"I must say that my experience with AA has been the exactly the opposite. I was able to talk to people, to send emails, and receive timely answers. I would recommend AA to anyone."
This happens to me too. They just help me after I contact PayPal and asked to cancel my payment!!
But have you completed the flights?
What? Thanks for this heads up. This was a reply to a comment but posting weirdEdited: 1 year ago 
You booked with Alternative Airlines. Where the tickets legit. Were actually able to fly with them?
I wouold agree.They Refunded me but 3 days after a book I got them saying me:SOrry we screwed youf flights here is the money and good buye.LAME!
"Things like this can happen.However, a refund after 3 days (if I understand you correctly) is actually good."
"I have booked with them f9r the last 18mths . Think they are brilliant.always able to contact them when needed. Great flights , great company!"
"I want to book with Alternative airlines. Anyone have recent information, experiences/"
"Alternative Airlines isn’t a fraud. They were great! There were a couple of minor glitches, which I was able to resolve well in advance with the airline. When I had questions, I was sent a response email within 12 hours. My daughter and I are set to go for our upcoming trip, and I’m glad I took a risk and tried a different platform to book our flights. I recommend them, and be prepared to do a little light housework with a phone call to the airlines. Took ten total minutes of my day, including hold time."
"My wife and I just purchased tickets from Alternative Airlines and there were two mistakes made on the names of my wife and my son's tickets. My wife emailed the company to ask them to correct her name misspelling and they almost immediately fixed it without having to talk to a single person. They even sent an email to confirm the name correction. My wife then realized that she did not add my son's middle name to the ticket so she called the company. No lie, they answered on maybe the second ring and immediately fixed the issue. I highly recommend this company from my experience so far."
i was transfered to their page and after reserving a flight toS.A. I decided to cancel the flight reserved for a month later. This was done the very next day. I was told I would be charged over 700 dollars to reschedule the flight at later date. The ticket price was around 1200 dollars. So over half would be charged to reschedule. The reservation was for Bolivia. I was told I could use rescheduled to any S.A. country. When I chose Ecuador I was told it had to be Bolivia . People are very cold and not understanding at all. I am still waiting to see what happens.
“i was transfered to their page”—-What do you mean you were transferred to their page? I assume you’d done a search online and chose to go this website?
"So many people claim to be transferred, directed or re-directed somewhere when they have chosen to go there themselves. If it's not a language issue, as in choosing the wrong word in an unfamiliar language, then I just don't get it."
Computers now have minds of their own. You open a browser and the internet automatically sends you to Kiwi or eDreams or Bravofly- haven’t you heard?!
"My internet must be faulty, lol!"
"My family and I were booked on the wrong flight in Geneva. I contacted Alternatives by email and they responded right away. They advised me to book another flight, which I did, and refunded the entirety of the new flight. I do recommend them"
"Some details about this website / company.The website ""AlternativeAirlines.com"" is registered 2004 for a company called: ""Flight Directors Scheduled Services Ltd."" => https:/…filing-historyThis company has 4 outstanding charges.This company shares are owned in full by ""Flightdirectors.com LTD"". Same phone, same address and shown openly on their website: https://www.flightdirectors.com/about-us/This company seems to be dormant. => https:/…filing-historyThat is an article about their turnover. Hence they come to the limit of matching the criteria of a small company in terms of turnover: https:/…"
"They are crooks, they charge you extra service that you can cancel your ticket, but when you want to cancel they will say you purchase no refundable ticket. The retard on the phone: ""unfortunately we contacted airlines and find out your tickets are non-refundable"" :DSo why did you charge me for free cancellation????????"
So. This free cancelation is obviously what it is: a scam.And you should have read that before buying it. Alternative airlines just sold you an option that THEY wont charge cancelation fees. Does not mean that your airline wont charge neither. Would you have read carefully then you would known
"#62, Don J -Not very nice to call the Alternative Airlines employee a ‘Retard’.When you decided to argue with “the retard on the phone” did you tell them how you missed the ticket fare change conditions twice and also did not read the very clear conditions of the Premium Service Package? As djey_daniel points out above, that fee only waives the fee from Alternative Airlines, not any fees, charges made by the airline.What you seem to have missed or have ignored:-a. Under each displayed flight option an ‘i’ information link which states “Is this fare refundable?” b. Before proceeding with booking the statement “Click to see the fare rules of the ticket you have selected”.c. Then for the Premium Service Package “Amendment without any charge by Alternative Airlines. Charges will apply depending on the fare rules of the airline ticket purchase” also followed by a click thru link to Terms & Conditions.Time for self reflection."
Don - you will always find there is a risk when you purchase something without reading and understanding it that what you 'think' should happen is not actually what you agreed towhy would you expect paying a small fee on a non-refundable ticket would magically turn it into an expensive refundable ticket?...
"""The retard on the phone""Why don't you start reading, what service you are actually buying. Assumptions are always risky, because you can be wrong. And wrong you were.""So why did you charge me for free cancellation"" As explained above that charge covers the agency fees and not the airline fees. Did you really expect that for a fistful of $ you can change a non-refundable, non-changeable ticket into a fully flexible, fully refundable ticket?"
"If we're going to hurl abusive words around, then there's one recent poster who seems to deserve the highly unpleasant title of 'retard' far more than the hapless employee of this company - and that's the person who makes assumptions rather than reading about what a service actually covers."
"I have booked earlier this year flights with them because we have been a party of 8 people and they offer split your payment which we wanted to try. The fares for the flights have been slightly higher then on other third side agencies as eDreams but the same price like booking directly with the airline. As those flights have been short 2h nonstop flights we didnt expect any problems to occur and hence decided to give it a try. All worked out perfectly, we recieved our etix within minutes. I have been able to check the booking reference with the airline and found our itenerary there. I also called the airline's CS just to be sure that everything went well. They confirmed. We flew without any problems. Nevertheless I would rather book with the airline directly BUT if you are in need of extra payment ways Alternative Airlines is an good option as they offer about 25 different payment-options. Just wanted to share my experience as there is not much available beside fake Trustpilot sites etc.Edited: 1 year ago "

@Adam SmithPlease do not spam.
"I totally second this review and add to it. This has been the absolute worst travel experience I have had in my life. This airline provide non refundable tickets. I bought a flight to go home, i live in London and wanted to get a ticket to go to Brazil to visit my family. Before my trip in December, my father discovered he had a tumour and I wanted to change the ticket to go home earlier to be with him through his surgery. I was told there was nothing to be done, even with a health emergency, and if I missed a flight( say buy a new ticket to go early) i would lose all my other flights, the return flight included. I received zero help from this company. Then when I actually boarded the flight, it was the most uncomfortable flight of my life. Did you know that luftansa has “economy” and “premium economy”?? Well, “premium” is the regular economy class that every other airline offers. Luftansa’s regular economy class is even worse, it has even less space between seats and practically a flat cushions on the seats. Do yourself a favour and stay clear of these guys, buying with them gives you zero flexibility, and zero help. You are better off spending the extra money buying from the airline, at least you can change your ticket and get proper help!"
"Im sorry to hear about your father but it’s likely your ticket was a non refundable one so booking direct with the airline would probably have made no difference. You need to claim on your travel insurance. That’s what it’s for. Booking through a third party adds another layer and may not save money, but it certainly doesn’t change the level of comfort on the plane. You just need to be careful about what sort of ticket you're buying, and in what class and check the t&c no matter who you book with."
"#72,I do not think that this group is an airline, but instead a ticket flogger: https:/…Best of luck with family health issues, and the airline booking.Hunt"
"#72, all of what you say is down to the airline’s fare conditions not the shonky ticket flogger you chose. Flexible air tickets are very expensive compared to cheap non refundable ones which often don’t permit changes. Travel insurance may cover this if your dad didn’t already have this condition when you booked the trip.Hope he makes a fully recovery."
"Sorry to hear about your father.Alternative Airlines are not an airline but a third party ticket flogger.Lufthansa economy does not offer much space, so do most other airlines. They are using slim seats in some aircraft which are becoming more and more common.""provide non refundable tickets"" These are the cheapest ticket but they are use-it-or-lose-it.Many airline will only give you the option of a free full refund of a non-refundable ticket in case of death of a close family member."

"Do not buy from them.They mixed everthing up and at the end i have payed to them 5.500 eur and for new tikets 8.000 eur. I had 2.000 eur additional costs. Forget them.I have read about their good business and that was reason that i have trusted them. My story :We have decided that we will tell to everyone on forums , travelers , websites like TripAdvisor what happened to us and how much money we lost because of you ! Because of simple email from your side. You do not give a s... for customers from you you get payed . Companies like your should not be on the market.

We will make story outOf this and you have my promise that this will become my hobby- finding unhappy customers of you. Unbelievable!Denis Renko"
"That’s an awful lot of money. Don’t know what happened, but appears some research before purchase would have helped. You didn’t read warnings before you purchased, did you?Do you think you will change someone’s mind with your posts? Probably not.Next time book directly with the airline."
"It is a pity you do not bother to explain what the problem was, just wanted to rant about it."
Story is that they have canceled tickets and they didi not send any notifications. And also cancelation was rheir mistake.To make story short :They did not send simple email that there is some problem. And this problem is between my card holder and them. I do not have nothing in between.Because of simple email or maybe a call ( i have bought from them for 5.500 eur ) everything would be ok. But now i have a big lost.
"Alternative Airlines - DO NOT USE - your money is their money, the CORONA epidemic and airports restricting travel is YOUR PROBLEM - NOT THEIRS. I made my costly mistake hope you don’t! ...and more fools like us for them to make money!"
"#82If this is because you bought a non-refundable ticket yet no longer wish to travel and want a refund but the airline is still operating the flight and their are no governmental travel advisories or restrictions in place, this won’t be the agent’s ‘problem’."

"Thank you for your input, its useful to know somebodys experience"
Nonsense!!!In the midst of this pandemic NO ONE AT ALTERNATIVE AIRLINES has returned my emails or answered their WhatsApp phone. Are you kidding? We payed over $2k for first class tix and need to cancel.
I am will also advice that on one should book flight on this site they are crooks scammers and con artists you can not get in touch with any one they don't even send a message to you about your ticket once they collect your money that's it
"Incompetent Customer Service - Lack of Transparency - bunch of crooks operating a so called business out of UK. How I wish lived in the UK at this point. What goes around comes around. During a global pandemic is when you decide to play dead and cheat people of their trust and money. Every single employee is a crook here. My only regret is I never researched them well enough before I booked tickets for the family. Not only is Alternative Airlines a crook, I have serious doubts that the so-called airlines they claim I made flight reservations thru Alternative is even real. No phone calls are picked up at airlines or emails responded AT ALL. Alternative Airlines is now playing dead. lolEdited: 11:17 pm, June 01, 2020 "
And where is my 3000 eur which i had to pay becuase you canceled my tickets ???
"'During a global pandemic is when you decide to play dead and cheat people of their trust and money.' At a guess this ticket flogger has the bare minimum of people working at the best of times; rather than 'play dead' they haven't got staff to deal with the current situation.'Every single employee is a crook here.' Tread carefully as that is a bold statement that may not be (probably is not) the case.'My only regret is I never researched them well enough before I booked tickets for the family. Not only is Alternative Airlines a crook, I have serious doubts that the so-called airlines they claim I made flight reservations thru Alternative is even real.' Since you've not mentioned the name of the carrier or any details of the booking you asked Alternative Airlines to make, it's impossible to determine if that's the case.'No phone calls are picked up at airlines or emails responded AT ALL.' Have you checked the status of the booking at the airline's website, and has your credit card been charged for a booking - and if not, why not? Alternative Airlines is a less than desirable ticket flogging site that most AT forum regulars wouldn't go near. These aren't known for having any aftercare, and I'd not expect that now. If you have had a booking cancelled and can't reach your agent - Alternative Airlines - then contact your credit card supplier and ask them to deal with this lousy operation.It's likely that Alternative Airlines will charge a fee to process a refund, and they'll have to find someone to contact the airline to request that refund. You may try to pursue them if you wish, but I'd let my credit card issuer deal with the problem."
"Not doing research is gonna get you every time. Expensive lesson learned, I hope."
">>>During a global pandemic is when you decide to play dead and cheat people of their trust and money.<<<What you really ought to say is that it's during a time of global pandemic that there won't be enough resources to deal with the huge remand for refunds, changes and everything else that consumers want from booking sites that might well be pretty poor at non revenue generating services in the first place."
"I will be making a full PR campaign in the US regarding Alternative Airlines. No American citizen should book travel with this airline. They cancel flights and refuse to refund. They want to offer voucher or credit. This should be AN OPTION, not a mandate. Unbelievable. The campaign starts next week."
Bella: Why do you think that will help? You didn't find this 3 year old thread when you booked with them.You need to reach people like you who don't do research. Email your friends. Post on Facebook. Tweet about the company.

Yes once they took your money that's it. I don't know why they are allowed to do this Kinds of Agents in US ? I am very Disappointed with Alternative airlines I am one of a Millions. Very Sad and everyone Stay away it's Fraud.
I booked flight from Mia to try back in march thru alternative Airlines. Todate five months later I have NOT received a flight credit or refund from them. ALL I'm.getting from them are THE RUN AROUNDS. NOW I HAVE TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY TO MAKE THIS RIGHT. I DONT RECOMMEND Anyone to use there service. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.
"Stop shouting, for heaven's sake!!!"
"#97Quite possible that the seller, Alternative Airlines, has not yet received the money from the actual airline. No agent is going to refund you until they receive the refund themselves. You mention MIA - were you booked with Virgin Atlantic by chance? If so, whilst they have started to make payment refunds they have been very slow and delayed."
Please Start petition. I'm ALREADY IN LINE TO SIGN. They robbed me.
"Dispute with your credit card. Stop shouting, we are just people like you. You sound more like Bruce Banner."
"I am so angry with Alternative Airlines. I have been trying to reach someone since Friday. I had to cancel my reservation in July and now that I am trying to use my travel credit with United and I cant. Alternative Airlines is a joke. They saved my ticket with Euros and did not complete the necessary information for United to help me rebook my ticket. I was on hold with 2 agents at United for over 1 hour. Both ladies trying to help me but unable too. I should of gotten a reply to get help with Alternative. This company is very endearing because they use paypal and affirm, with COVID19 its best to book flights directly with the airlines. They will give you instant travel credit and refunds, No BS like you get from this company. I am beside myself that one has returned my emails. Dont waste your time or energy here!"
I am having the same problem. I have sent multiple emails and haven’t received a reply. Completed ignored.
Removed my review because it was true that I was mistreated since I bought a ticket with insurance ?
"I don’t understand your post, Michael."
"Michael, what review, where did you write the review, and who removed it?Or do you mean your posting #96 which is still here on this forum topic, on the previous page, but you think it was removed?"
I have Cancelled my Trip due to Covid 19 but the alternative Airlines not willing to refund my money. They don't even answer my Call. When I write a review they delete it.
"Did you decide to cancel your trip yourself, either because you didn't want to take the risk or because some country imposed restrictions on people arriving from particular places, or did the airline cancel the flight altogether so nobody at all could take it?This is important, because normally Alternative Airlines sell non-refundable tickets, so if you decide not to go, there won't be any refund. But if the airline cancels the flight entirely, it should refund the money to Alternative Airline, who then refund you, minus an administration fee, At the moment airlines are taking between a few weeks and many months to refund agents, and some agents are taking further months to pass it on to their clients."
"Where are you writing these reviews, Michael?Did you buy a refundable ticket? If not, why do you think you deserve a refund?"
