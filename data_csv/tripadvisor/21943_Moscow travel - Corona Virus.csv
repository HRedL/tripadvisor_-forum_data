"Hi All ,I'm planning to visit Moscow in May this year. I will need to apply for Visa and plan for travel essentials etc.How do you think the situation would be in May? I know it's hard to predict and things might change rapidly , but I am just curious to know what you think it may likely happen.How concerned do you think I should be if I am planning to visit Moscow in May?Thanks!"
"Your guess is as good as anyone’s. Your question is not specific to Moscow or Russia. None knows what future holds in this respect. I have a trip planned and ticketed for the summer, but things are on hold at this point."
"To date, from my viewing of Russian news (from Russia, in Russian), they have not had larger numbers, and have fairly aggressively shut down travel in from effected areas...BUT, to me, as with the US, it is of course, altogether possible they will be seeing an increase over the next few months at least..."

">>... I am just curious to know what you think it may likely happen.<<I don't think much is going to happen, with regard to the coronavirus, here in Russia. The Russians got in very early at the borders, and right now, there are only 2 active cases in the whole country. And since it all began, there have only been 4 cases in Russia. Moscow, a city of roughly 15 million people, has had no cases, same as here in Saint Petersburg. Vancouver has 18 active cases. Toronto right now, has 19 active cases, and I'd plan to go to there tomorrow, if needed. The Chinese quarantine flattened the bell curve on the outbreak, and that made all the difference. Most people recover from this viral infection. Read at the link what the great Dmitry Lvov has to say about it - anything can happen, but more than likely it will end in a year, and go back to the bats:https:/…Good luck"
"“More likely it will go away in a year”...Unless there is something even more magical about Russia than we already know, this is NOT what scientists are saying...which is it may very well slowly go away over the next 3-4 months, BUT only to come roaring back in the Fall...When in doubt, visit CDC or WHO as they have actual scientists and experts studying this..,Note that in the US we have WAY too much “don’t worry, be happy” messaging from the very top leadership...and do NOT forget that one can only say we have very few cases if one has tested HUGE numbers of the population, Again, US has had the same issue, with leadership crowing about few cases we have when we have tested LESS THAN 1,000...out of sight may well be out of mind, but does NOT mean “not happening”,"
"Thanks for the replies folks.Btw.. I read this morning on Moscow times and it concerns me. Can someone clarify what this means?""— The 14 day self-isolation regime for people returning to Moscow from some of the worst-affected countries was extended. People entering the capital from China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, U.K, Norway and the U.S are required to stay inside for two weeks""Does this mean , me as a visitor , if I fly from Canada to Russia transiting via UK/Germany , I would need to quarantine myself for 14 days inside?!This has got me really worrying. Appreciate your inputs. Thanks."
"I would STRONGLY encourage folks to NOT toss around terms like ""most people recover""...most of us are NOT doctors, and unless this comes from a well-known medical authority, like say CDC or NIH in the US, the WHO, each country's Ministry of Health, it makes ZERO sense to just use whatever someone says on the Internet...Mayor's office of Moscow would also be a reasonable place for local Moscow info"
"Footy love, I think you are asking us how the government will react to the likely spread of the virus. The simple answer: travel restrictions of all kinds. You can’t predict what restrictions. That’s the problem. French Polynesia, where I was heading next, suddenly started to ask all visitors for medical clearance. And that’s before they even have a single case. When they get one, I’m sure things will change with more restrictions. The same with with Russia, which I visit frequently. Most Russians are in denial for now, but when (not if) things start to change, travel restrictions will be put in place quickly. Russia’s healthcare system is not that great and can’t handle acute cases as well as other countries. So if I have to guess, Russia will be quicker than other countries to restrict travel, because they can’t afford an epidemic. In fact, Russia was the first (or one of the first) country to close border with China. That gives you some idea how Russia will react in the future."
"https://www.interfax.ru/moscow/698107If you are flying from Canada you should be OK to travel unless Russia expands the travel wanring. Right now, those coming from the USA are to be self quarantined for 14 days once entering Moscow. I was supposed to Travel in mid April.....may cancel everything."
"What if you're from one of the restricted countries, but haven't visited it in the last 4 months and are travelling from a non-restricted country?"
"Thanks for the reply!But seriously - does this apply to ""foreign tourists"" who are visiting Russia!? The link above I think mentions ""Citizens"" , which I think only applies to Russian nationals.Think about this - if I am a tourist who has a Russian tourist visa valid for 6 days , the Russian government would want me to quarantine in Moscow for 14 days? This adds all sorts of complexities."
"Hi footlove:>>Can someone clarify what this means?<<I can't find an original source that includes the USA - I just read that a hotline said that the USA was on the list. The original decree, in Russian, doesn't say USA. However, if the USA is included, then I can't see Canada being far behind. Voice of America has published:""Meanwhile, there were simpler questions, such as how the measure would apply to tourists, family members and pets. The head of Moscow’s health department, Alexey Khripun, suggested the simplest solution was for Russians and others to simply stay put. ""-----------------So, if I were you, I'd delay for 2-4 weeks (if possible), and see what happens. You can get a visa in 3 days in Toronto, and flights from Toronto are at rock-bottom prices right now, without much lead-time. I've been checking for friends (for autumn). BTW, I know 6 healthcare professionals in Russia, and they all scoff and call it the seasonal flu. A medical Professor on the BBC today said that any vaccine will be too late, but it might be of use if it re-emerges. An article that might be of interest:""Why I’m taking the coronavirus hype with a pinch of salt""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/20…Good luck"
"""What if you're from one of the restricted countries, ""If you read most travel bans and quarantine restrictions it starts with ""those who hold a xxxx Passport"" first and foremost, as there is little one can do to prove they have not resided in that country prior to travel, and any Government or Border Control don't have any interest in assessing whether a person has been residing in that country or not.Next is those returning from or have recently visited one of the listed countries who also need quarantining.Transiting through a country is not seen as a major risk, but don't count it out, transiting through European Cities such as Italy, Germany, France, South Korea, but also Middle Eastern cities such as Doha and Dubai could become a consideration. Airports are a high risk area as you have travelers from destinations from all over the globe, including hot spots, all in close proximity to each other, sharing food halls, bathrooms, etc.Edited: 3:08 pm, March 07, 2020 "
https://www.interfax.ru/moscow/698070USA is on the list
"It literally doesn't mention ""passport"" on any of the English websites and I wouldn't trust Google Translate for the Russian ones. I assume I'll have to wait until Monday when the embassies are going to publish official information."
">>USA is on the list<<Yes, I saw that, and I thank you for the link.I usually corraborate information 3 or 4 times before fully accepting it (and even then, keep an open mind about it - reality being the greatest illusion). Perhaps an updated decree will appear soon."
I contacted Aeroflot and they had not yet heard about restriction from USA. Best to contact your Russian consulate for perhaps more up to date info.
"But seriously - does this apply to ""foreign tourists"" who are visiting Russia!?

What about Turkey ?
">. I read this morning on Moscow times ------------------------------------------------------- don't read the ""Moscow Times"" stuff, it'd a gazette set up by some yank long time ago and which pretends to give ""informations"" to native english speakers who are too lazy to learn some russian. Despite having a couple locals writing for them it's basically bs. You could as well read ""news"" about Russia told by the american foreign services.>— The 14 day isolation regime for people returning to Moscow from some of the worst-affected countries was extended. People entering the capital from China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, U.K, Norway and the U.S are required to stay inside for two weeks""Does this mean , me as a visitor , if I fly from Canada to Russia transiting via UK/Germany , I would need to quarantine myself for 14 days inside?!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------no you will not by quarantined because if from a risky origin, will be teste and if tested positive at the arrival border you will be denied entry.Besides this sentence doesn't make sense; people can enter Russia at different airports, and a gazillion road crossings. What sense does it make that, in order to avoid a pandemic in the country, people entering in would be quarantined only from Moscow airports?I am from Norway, listed on your quote, and where in fact the epidemic is almost nihil, ie. there are some 150 who tested positive after they went by themselves to be tested because they were returning from travels in China and Italy. All where told to stay home two weeks and nobody has fallen sick. I am often in SPb for week-ends and this one is the case, I arrived yesterday at Pulkovo, from Oslo via transit in Helsinki. Nothing special at arrival in Pulkovo. Only unusual thing were all chineses (and maybe koreans, etc) in Oslo and Helsinki airports had masks.Today I spend time with a friend who is italian speaker and works as a guide. Northern Italy is the main cluster of that influenza in Europe. She told me that from now on passengers arriving from Italy will be tested at the border. That's all. This does affect her touristic business and travel agencies in Italy specialized in Russia, because for fear of being denied entrance at the border and having to return back to Italy, there are massive cancellations there.so what could be the worst is:*IF* your arrival flight is tested, and if negative you get inside, if positive your are returned home by the airline which brought you in. So no quarantine at all for sure.for locals, residents in the country, returning home that's different of course. It seems Russia is going to do like Norway and others: if someone test postivie, then recommended to stay home two weeks.all this is more media noise than an actual issue. Only those already weakened by some ailment and elderlies over 80 are the most victims. The press doesn 't have much to chew on, like a kievian putsch, syrian war, iranian pre-war, etc, so the most spectacular thing is that influenza....and in May when you will travel, all this will be over anywayIn fact it may be a unique occasion to visit museums and touristy staples without the hordes of chineses and without some yuropans like italians, because the massive early cancellations happening now."
"Agree 100% about Moscow Times...it is a foreign funded rag which of course always supports opposition positions...and as such should not be relied on for unbiased information.Also, the current stuff I am reading in trying to check seems very much targeted at RUSSIAN CITIZENS who are RETURNING. The very idea of letting someone in when maybe their stay is, what, 6-7 days and insist on a 14-day isolation period....where, at HOTEL?...seems odd to say the least. Almost all the details about subject to such quarantine relate to how said folks can get formal documentation for sick days, visits to doctor, etc...But, do need to stay tuned..."
"This is the approach being taken by nations all over the world, if you are from a nation that the destination has identified as one of the at risk countries, two things will happen, you will either be refused entry at the border, or will have to enter into self isolation at the hotel you are booked into .The port of entry does not care if your stay is 1 day or 30 days, the mandatory quarantine period is 14 days.Two Italian cyclist arrived in New Zealand to compete in a Mountain Bike event, but were advised by the Health Authority that that had to serve a 14 day self isolation period in their Hotel first, so obviously not happy, and went home.This is the reality we now live in, if you are from China, Iran, South Korea and Italy, you will either be turned away at the border or need to self isolate for 14 days.Many nations are expanding the list of countries to include Japan, Germany, France, well most of Europe now, the UK, and with the US now over 400 cases, the US.Returning nationals obviously won't be turned away, but will be required to self isolate for 14 days if returning from any listed risk nations.There is no ambiguity about what happens, just which countries are on the every increasing list, and forget thinking a cruise is a good idea."
"Not rejecting what is being said with such authoritative confidence, but can you please provide the source...assuming this is true, I would expect airlines and hotels would be proactively contacting all of us and advising if we carry thru with such travel, we will effectively be held prisoner, and be forced to pay for an extra 5-10 days hotel stay, miss work, etc.I fully understand measures may be at or reach this point, but I am wondering where all the hotels will get the security personnel to enforce this...and then how they themselves are able to not become stationary cruise ships, that is, a hotbed for further spreading the virus."
">This is the approach being taken by nations all over the world, if you are from a nation that the destination has identified as one of the at risk countries, two things will happen, you will either be refused entry at the border, or will have to enter into self isolation----indeed. In case of OP question, it means in practice that IF the pandemic becomes an issue in HIS country, he will not be able to enter Russia at all, like in the case of chineses being banned because airports don't allow in flights from China, or he will be allowed to fly over but will be tested at the border and if he tests positive, will be denied entrance in the country, so plane back home (with any optional quarantine room for waiting)"
"The biggest question to me is the self-isolation, and it has been cited frequently that as of March 6th, the Russian Consumer Supervisory Agency has formally announced the US, with some 350-400 CONFIRMED cases, is now included...which is interesting because at present, while unlike our “president” EVERYONE knows this is heading for HUGE, 10x increases if not 100x, to me this pretty much means in the next week or so, pretty much EVERY country will be on the list...Again, NOT disputing or arguing...but it is interesting as to when airlines and hotels will proactively contact KNOWN travelers, and perhaps pre-emptively cancel reservations...because at a minimum, the “logistics” of REQUIRING folks stay in a single hotel, which WILL then become a new, cruise ship type breeding ground, will make this totally UNPALATABLE for any tourist...not to mention cost..."
https://www.vaxbeforetravel.com/russian-trav…
"Okay. Well if this ""self isolation"" for Toruists/visitors is true , why in the first place should you be allowed to board the aircraft?And how is it effective in combating the virus if this restriction applies only to Moscow?So , a tourist would still be able to enter other Russian towns and cities without quarantine/isolation?"
"I contacted Aeroflot in NYC yesterday, on March 7, and they knew nothing about it, and were presumably letting people board flights from New York. I guess all of these people will be subject to self-quarantine. Surprise!! I've received NO notice from Aeroflot about my tickets. Waiting for an official word to hopefully get a refund or at least a voucher."
"#27 - EXACTLY my point...and I see another post that even Aeroflot has nothing...Bottom line is there is NO WAY to see this as other than totally shutting down travel into Russia because no one in their right mind is going to spend thousands of $ to sit in a hotel room, likely only to catch the virus anyway because, well, they put all potentially infected people in the same space...a wee bit bigger than a cruise ship...Will wait a couple of weeks as my May travel plans will have to be redone, and so expect my hotel and airlines to allow me to change reservations (domestically, airline already did this for me...Sigh..."
I booked a tour to Russia for mid-April and being so worried about the new quarantine rule for tourists from the US.
"I am mid-May and pretty sure will have to change. Ironically, it seems the only way this will get resolved quickly is if Moscow follows suit with the US which went from what our ""president"" continues to declare is not a big deal to a guaranteed full-blown epidemic like other flus before...but with no vaccine. That is, it won't make much sense to ban 10-15 countries which have varying degrees of the infection spreading as Moscow gets up into the hundreds and thousands, and where the spread will then be happening in more ""community"" fashion."
"My trip to Russia is in beginning of May.I am not sure what will /will not happen. There is a lot of time till my trip so I will monitor. In 1-2 weeks there could be much changes.At moment , this 'quarantine' , '14 day isolation' doesn't make sense for tourists. With hundreds of planes flying in everyday and tens of thousands of people, what is realistic?I understand the 'thermal monitoring' and 'face recognition' but how to pick and choose who to test, I presume a 'temp check'. But if needed an isolation , and later determined does have virus , what about everyone on that flight that could be anywhere in country?"
">>At moment , this 'quarantine' , '14 day isolation' doesn't make sense for tourists.<<We think alike beams, and there's nothing official that says it's policy for tourists. May is generally the end of flu season. Tomorrow is a government holiday in Russia for Women's Day today, so it might be midweek before something official appears online.And just for a reality check (for other readers also):'This flu season alone has sickened at least 19 million across the U.S. and led to 10,000 deaths and 180,000 hospitalizations.'“In the U.S., it’s really a fear based on media and this being something new,” Dr. Jennifer Lighter, hospital epidemiologist at NYU Langone Health...""https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/03/the-flu-has-…'Up to 650 000 people die of respiratory diseases linked to seasonal flu each year...'https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/14-12-2…"
""" I would expect airlines and hotels would be proactively contacting all of us""What is being lost on everyone, and agreed, extremely frustrating, is that this is an evolving pandemic where restrictions and rules on quarantine are changing almost hourly, and with the number of flights word wide and Hotel bookings, it would be unrealistic to expect Hotels and Airlines to keep travelers up to date with the current restrictions being applied in every destination, the onus is on the traveler, it is up to the traveler to know which passport they're traveling on and what restrictions apply based on their nationality, but also be aware of restrictions based on port of departure.Flights are landing all over the globe carrying tourists of varying origin, and on a single flight, may only be carrying 3 or 4 Italians, South Koreans, etc, but it is their nationality that will determine their entry status.Flights may still be arriving from the US in Russia, but remember, many travelers are transiting through the US and are not traveling on a US Passport, and not from a country listed for exclusion or quarantine, so are allowed entry. There are few countries where flights originating are banned from landing such as flights from China.So really, it is up to the traveler to assess the risk based on where they're travelling from and to, and what passport they're traveling on.The Italians that turned up in New Zealand, arrived on the 2nd of March and mandatory self isolation rules introduced on the 3rd, They were unlucky, but were still tracked down by health authorities and told to self-isolate.The Lombardy region in Italy is now fully locked down, if you are looking to head to Samoa, from ANY nation, you must present a doctors certificate on arrival that is no older than 3 days.This is disrupting plans across the globe, I personally booked a trip in June last year to take my mother to Tokyo this April, but canceled it when cases in Japan hit 50 and large gatherings were being canceled. Japan is now over 500 and schools are closed.The US is now closing in on 500 cases, with the consensus that the lower level of testing suggests the actual number is much higher.There are no signs of the pandemic abating outside of China, France and Germany are over 1,000 cases, Italy have now passed South Korea with 1,500 new cases for a total of 7,375.Most of Europe is seeing an exponential increase in cases, globally there have been over 3,600 NEW cases and 230 new deaths.It really is up to each traveler to reassess their travel plans for the upcoming months as I doubt it's going to get better in the immediate future.Edited: 4:12 pm, March 08, 2020 "

"Re 34 - nothing is being lost on me, or quite a few other posters here...There is NOTHING wrong or inaccurate with posing the point that BOTH hotels and airlines SHOULD be able to keep up...we ALL know things are changing fast, BUT when we get strong news of not only ""serious"" requirements, but ones which will in fact TOTALLY wipe out any point in getting on a plane in the first place, then it is NOT unreasonable for such major players to themselves stay up to date, and, as I suggested, PROACTIVELY advise THEIR customers.And that INCLUDES ensuring they are seeing any and all OFFICIAL pronouncements...and while sure, the thousands if not tens of thousands of us who have such plane and hotel stays can each check every day, every minute...only to find out that for our travel plans 1-2-3-4-5-6-7 days out are now in question, the hotels and airlines ALREADY knew, and could EASILY, SYSTEMATICALLY send out some kind of notice. Heck, I get these from my airline when there is a schedule change of 5 minutes."

"#37 I can sense a growing level of anger and frustration, which is more than reasonable as you are obviously travelling in the near future and just want answers.The problem is, that the speed at which things are changing the answer today may be different tomorrow. Just look at the speed at which the situation has changed for Italy, France, Germany and Spain in under 2 weeks, especially Spain which has come out of nowhere.Hopefully if you are travelling to Russia, and the US does end up on the quarantined list, you do get a notification from your Airline and Hotel, but until that day happens, there is little either can advise you.Many valued contributors to this forum are struggling to find a definitive position by the Russia Authorities, and who knows, by the time the exact position has been clarified, it changes tomorrow.You, like me, are just one of the many 10,000's of travelers booked on holiday trying to decide what to do, a decision only that traveler can make based on the information to hand, and may well have to do their own predictions based on the growing case numbers and what has happened to travelers from other nations such as China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, Germany and now Spain.It's just a guessing game who is next.

"Appreciate the KLM...the Twitter feed is ridiculous...yet another example of what the heck is wrong with the world...IMHO,,,"
"That includes me, unfortunately. USA to Amsterdam to Moscow. Wow. But its life and I'll have to seriously re-think my plans."
"I called SVO Airport today, to a phone number given by the Russian Embassy in DC. I told her of my plans - fly to SVO, take a taxi to a Moscow train station and then take an overnight train that same night. She said I do not need to quarantine in Moscow or in the city I'm staying at. She said the quarantine, for Americans, only applies to those staying IN Moscow. Not for people in my situation, for example. That's good news to me. The situation could however change and change suddenly.Again, I also am flying from Amsterdam to Moscow (but first a flight from USA to Amsterdam). I can't say what the rules are for those of other nationalities, only Americans. And, again, the situation can always change."
"Appears the ban is ""only"" on EUROPEANS flying into US...how, not sure if KLM will keep flying planes that effectively can only fly US citizens...I have the same issue since I use Delta and there only option is thru Paris or Amsterdam...Aeroflot is still available out of JFK and Miami...(limited days of the week for the latter- 4 or 5!"
"https:/…1580226297.htmThey also seem to back up what I was saying: that the quarantine is only for those planning to *stay* in Moscow. The website was linked from KLM's site. Specifically: https://wecare.klm.com/nl_en/ , under ""Where can I find the latest travel advice per destination?"".RUSSIAN FED. - published 07.03.20205. Passengers who have been in China (People's Rep.), France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Korea (Rep.) or Spain and are planning to stay in Moscow must report to the special hotline by phone. They must stay self-isolated in Moscow for a period of 14 days or for the duration of their stay if less than 14 days."

Passengers who have been in China (People's Rep.), France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Korea (Rep.) or Spain""which based on speed of the outbreak is significantly outdated.Further more, the current position taken by the US, as declared by His Great Orangeness, is likely to gain a reciprocal position taken by Russia and EU Member (now that the UK is no longer in the EU). So freedom of travel is probably going to become increasingly difficult for US Citizens, and that's not even considering climbing case numbers in the US itself.Singling out the UK for preferential treatment will also not bod well a European response."

"Beams2009: is Moscow your final stop? And were you forced to quarantine? If so, what were the procedures put in place? Thanks for any help. Am scheduled to arrive on the 14th (but again with another city as my final destination. But first to the train station and then an overnight train ride)."
I gave info only about this flight from LA. I didn't use this flight but a few days ago I know of someone who did use this flight. He didn't say anything was unusual
"Ahh ok, thanks for that."
"#57...oops...sorry for missing the LA Aeroflot!!! Also, when you say “a few days ago”, any way to be more precise? Seems the US got added to this list we still can’t quite seem to find on the ORIGINAL government site on or a bit after March 5th...Am seeing some videos from Russian friends returning to Moscow...Domodedovo, and it is EERY...very few people, more in hazmat suits than passengers it seems.BUT, back to your point, and really for ANYONE in the last week going thru passport control and out into Moscow proper EXACTLY what happened...from the minute they stepped off the plane..."
Don't forget about direct flight from Washington DC.
">>>>Don't forget about direct flight from Washington DC.I just looked on skyscanner and only NY, Miami and LA have non-stop flights to Moscow currently"
"I see now, Monday flights into Moscow from DC"
"We arrived in Moscow yesterday from Amsterdam. Terminal E, no checks beside the regular passport and visa check. So no temperature checks. We passed security in 5 minutes. Right now it is very quiet, no lines. Situation at security control: https:/…ES_6cDWXgAIHCnM.jpg"
"Thanks for infoYou flew with KLM?Edited: 5:33 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"Super...but correct me if I am wrong, Netherlands not yet on the “bad” list? I only ask with regard to the “self quarantine” requirement..."
"Not on the list, but may come soon. We flew KLM. This evening we will return to Amsterdam. Must say, it was very quiet here in Moscow. Hardly any lines. Possibly this was one of the last possibilities to travel for us. Take care everybody"
"Thanks so much, and best of luck! Appreciate this news at least. Russia does seem to be taking this very seriously, have since very early on...but for all their caution and measures, of course they will see a bigger outbreak..."
"Russia bans entry of foreign nationals, stateless people from March 18 to May 1https:/…"
And what will happen with our visas? They will amend them with later dates? I was going to travel in Moscow on April 30th/
"Best to address this question to your friendly Consulate...for sure, if you are not from say the US and have a 3 year visa, but rather one limited to less than a 1 month stay, you will likely new an entirely new ""physical"" visa"" - can't imagine Russia would adopt any procedures to accept an expired visa..."
"I am not US citizen i am Greek, anyway i will phone them or send them an email to learn about it, I dont mind so much to apply for a visa again, but if i have to pay again, when already i paid for a visa i will never use because they closed their borders, then yes more or less i will be annoyed. And ofcourse its not only the visa i will have to buy again invitation letter and medical insurance for the visa. The last time i paid about 62 euros for the visa, 22 euros for the invation and about 18 euros for the med insurance (5 nights stay)."
"I hear you...and this is not even including the hassle...but, given TOTAL shutdown of the country until at least May 1st, HUGE number of folks will be in the same position...not that that makes you feel better :-("
"Aruminas, is it possible to delay your trip by one day. As of right now, 00:01 on May 1st ban is lifted. I don't know when you bought your flight, if it was before early March, airline may change day fee free.Either way something has to change."
"But would NOT count on May 1 being a lock...to me, they just tossed this out initially as a date a bit further out (a lot of places started with a 1 month period of something...)...it could well be as they get closer, and as the coronavirus continues showing more folks (due more to TESTING, NOT “spread”), if Russia’s numbers remain lower by a LOT, the are not going to reopen the country and risk a spike of cases...IMHO..."
"Much has happened over the last few days globally!Cases rising , border closures , travel advisories , emergencies declared , wow - events which have never occurred before.Now given all this , would you still consider traveling?Would Russia be in your plans at some point later on this year? Or the impact of COVID-19 is simply so huge that travel this year may not be a good choice at all? What's your views?"
"#75 Ask again in June. His Great Orangeness said it would all start to go away in April when it got warm and now the US is at 27,000, third behind Italy and China, 3X as many deaths than that of South Korea.But Russia, just 306 with little movement over the last few days. So Russia, yes, great place to visit, but with the UK, US and Europe burning, I don't think they'll be letting anyone in other than the Chinese.Hopefully with what has happened in China, 3-4 months could be a different landscape, but does the US, UK or Europe have the fortitude to lock down to the same authoritarian manner as China?Edited: 6:38 am, March 22, 2020 "
"US at 450 dead...and NOW growing at 100 per day, likely to double in 3 days...we are NOW seeing the real “spread rate” since the USELESS figures of “infected” are ONLY, and I repeat, ONLY “diagnosed” based on a testing rate = MAYBE 10%, likely 1%, of what the better countries have done...once the DEATH rate starts to drop back down, only then can we even begin to say we are flattening the curve..."
"If you look at the stats, the US does now seem to be on top of its testing, does not mean the number of cases are going to drop, but at least there is a better picture of the extent of the spread.When the US were about 204 cases the mortality rate was about 4%, but as the testing has increased, the mortality rate has been progressively dropping, and now sits at around 1.21%, which will be close to a true reflection of the number of cases, as South Korea with one of the most extensive testing regimes is 1.24% and the closed sample of the Diamond Princess is 1.12%, even neighbors Canada is at 1.13%.But the thing is this is just an indicator that testing is close to reflecting the true number of infections, it does not mean it is under control. Just now there is a better picture of how many US citizens will die, about 1.21% of those infected, so that is the target, if the the US gets to 1M cases, 12,100 will die, it is all about taking appropriate actions so that the US does not reach 1M cases."
"Sorry, missing the point here...when your DENOMINATOR is NOT, NOT the REAL number of “infected”, but due to STILL lagging testing, AT BEST maybe 10% of this number, then one CANNOT have any meaningful lethality. This is not biology, or chemistry, or physics, but simple grade school math...Now, the GOOD news so to speak is given the denominator is NOT (as of this a.m,) 43000 “infected” but DIAGNOSED/DETECTED, which the 540 deaths would be divided by, but more like maybe 500,000...then we have a fatality rate of, what, .1%. Some might say, gee, not bad, BUT given the extremely high rate of contagion, would yield as many warned a HUGE death toll...at least 100,000 if 1/3 of us catch this...Again, to see the spread of this either way, keep your eyes on the DEATHS...and sorry for this horrible, dismal, yet mathematically warranted view...And, no, this is not at all limited to the US or Russia, or Moscow...sorry!!!"
"#79 sorry, but pull your head in, Analytics is my profession, I do this for a living, and of course it is not just the US and Russia, but is more relevant for this forum rather than 195 other nations impacted by COVID-19.When dealing with Analytics you can only work with the figures available, and then use that data to formulate various hypotheses. Hence the observation that the US mortality rate is falling to within probable norms based on those being reported by similar nations for societal structure, governance, healthcare and economy.Now you would also know there is a lag in deaths that follow cases, which can be 2 - 3 weeks, why China are still seeing new deaths with no new cases, but you know that.But using these measures you can also draw conclusions that Italy's case count is totally non-representative of actual number, with a mortality rate double that of Iran, so would suggest the real case count for Italy is at least 3 times the reported figure, and that the UK should at least be on par with the US and other European nations of around the 1% mark, so a 5% mortality rate indicates the true level of infection is probably 5 X the current figure 8,000 cases and is more likely to be 40,000.But that is just guessing like you."
Hello!Anyone from Canada (citizen or PR) traveled to Russia recently? How was your experience?Thanks.
"Russia has been totally closed for tourism back to late March, and no imminent word on re-opening...they MAY start in September, but slowly, and from some word, will be done in consideration of where the tourist is coming from - Canada is FAR more likely to ""qualify"" due to your lower ""case"" % - more success in dealing with Covid...stay tuned here as we have EXCELLENT native Russian helpers and experts who I am sure will post as soon as something official is known...heck, neither Consulates NOR ""visa agencies"" will even accept apps for visas at this time...Note that Russia DID ""open"" a wee bit about 1 month ago, BUT...ONLY for very specific, urgent needs...NOT general tourism..."
