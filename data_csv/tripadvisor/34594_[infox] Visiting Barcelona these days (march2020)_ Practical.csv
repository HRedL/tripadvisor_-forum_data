"Here it comes, some new measures announced today for the whole of Catalonia, including Barcelona: 1.) Schools and universities to be closed for two weeks from tomorrow.2.) Public libraries, gyms, youth clubs and, in general, establishments run by the Barcelona City Hall, to be closed for two weeks too.3.) Internal transportation capacity (trains, metro, bus) to be reduced by 2/3rds, This doesn't mean there won't be any but frequency will be lower. No further news for now."
""" Internal transportation capacity (trains, metro, bus) to be reduced by 2/3rds""I am travelling to Barcelona in a few days and heavily reliant on trains during the journey.Where can I check which trains will be cancelled? The RENFE website?"
"La Liga has announced that the next two weekends (at least) have been suspended. See, among others, https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/ma…I have not seen an announcement about next week's UEFA CL matches.Edited: 10:43 am, March 12, 2020 "
"@MirandaB, yes at www.renfe.com Note it's very likely there'll be cancellations as the next 7-10 days are going to be critical to slow the outbreak.Further developments:4.) Sagrada Família and Casa-Museu Gaudí to be closed from tomorrow March 13th until further notice5.) RENFE announces it'll refund tickets/travelpasses. Further details --only in Spanish... as always :((-- here: https:/… Use Google translate."
"@BGJ-DC, yep but this news had already been overtaken by a previous one (at least here in Catalonia) banning gatherings of more than 1000 people until the end of March. So, anyone travelling ""just because of a match"", forget it"
"**UPDATE MARCH 12th 10pm**- From midnight on March 15th, international cruisers won't be able to embark or disembark passengers in Catalonia for a period of two weeks.- The city of Igualada and neighbouring towns (70km from Barcelona) have been quarantined. No one in or out from tonight at 9pm for two weeks (emergency and basic services will be provided).- Train tickets for long-range cancelled trains (AVE, Alvia...) will be refunded. More info (in Spansih only) here: https:/…"
EnricM:Great post!
Thanks for this and I'm watching this thread to keep up to date. We are scheduled to leave on good Friday and as of now have no plans to cancel.
"I am going to barcelona with a friend tomorrow and we are unable to cancel as well.So I guess we will try to make the best of it, be more cautious than normally, wash hands very often, and enjoy the city as much as possible during these circumstances."
"Thank you Enric - very helpful. BTW, all Champions League and Europa League matches have been postponed."
"MPORTANTThe government of Catalonia has declared, a few minutes ago, a self-containment for the whole of the Catalan nation in order to avoid the collapse of the health care system. The Catalan President has just asked the Spanish President to issue the necessary orders to enforce this containment by cutting airports, ports and long-distance trains as these are managed by the Spanish State.It should be expected, over the weekend, that Catalonia will become isolated for the next two weeks.However, the Spanish President has declared the state of emergency and it's not clear, politically speaking, whether he will honour that request or whether he'll take a different approach.As more information becomes available I will post it here."
Miranda be careful. All the idiots from Madrid heading for the coast has caused havoc and it is all spiralling badly. Enrics advice is very serious and today for the first time I say no-one should travel on holiday this weekend
"UPDATE 14MARCH 7PMWhile the Spanish government hasn't yet taken any (effective) action regarding the newly declared 'state of emergency' and has postponed any decision until tomorrow Sunday, the Catalan government has already started to control entrances to Catalonia via long-distance trains (AVE and the like) at Sants station in Barcelona, as well as at the motorways AP-2/E-90 and AP-7/E-15 in the entrances to Catalonia coming from Madrid/Aragón and Valencia. Those suspected of being infected with CoVid19 are being either prevented entrance and/or taken to the hospital.Politically, the situation is a bit unstable at present as the Catalan and Basque Country governments are not accepting the overtaking of their competences in Health and Safety and Police and Security by the Spanish government, as being discussed earlier this morning in Madrid. Late yesterday, the Catalan president declared the intention of sealing Catalonia for the next two weeks to contain the spread of the outbreak and avoid the collapse of the health care system. For that, and since the Spanish government manages airports, ports and the main network of trains, the Catalan president requested cooperation to the Spanish president to temporarily close these services. No response so far. Thus, since time is of the essence, the Catalan government has started to take measures of its own such as those described earlier. Unfortunately, the competences on international infrastructures are centralized in the hand of the Spanish government in Madrid and the Catalan government cannot force its closure.More to follow."
Best wishes to you! Thanks for the updates. We in the US only get limited info on specific issues within other nations. We in Southern California are also staying close to home and hoping our health care system can handle things ahead.
"Thank you for your concern. Yesterday, my travel partner and I actually decided not to go, after we heard about the quarantined zones south of Barcelona.Kind of disappointed by the Spanish government that there is no official statement telling tourists to stay away."
"Just taken part in a moving tribute to health workers. At exactly 10 o’clock EVERYONE came out onto their balconies to clap and cheer local health workers. The very few cars on the streets beeping their horns. So simple, but so sincere and moving. I am all welled up. A wave of honest, grateful applause right across the city."
You’re not alone Miranda! I share with you the frustrations brought about this virus. But it’s better to be safe and not transmit the virus to the vulnerable people. My family was supposed to travel to Barcelona on the 25th from USA but we had to cancel it. I’ve been constantly monitoring since day 1 when spain had their first case and noticed that there’s a sharp rise to their cases. It’s only a matter of time until they do lockdown like italy. Let’s be all safe and look after another in crisis like these. Godbless us all!
Re Post 18 ...nice one!Anthony K.
"UPDATE 15MARCH 9AMThe Spanish government officially declared the 'state of emergency' yesterday evening. The measures are quite disappointing though as they do not follow the recommendations by the Catalan Presidency and the medical community and borders and transportation networks are not being closed for quarantine. Furthermore, the Spanish presidency has recentralized powers taking away some of the competences of regional governments, which were effectively fighting against the outbreak. Pathetic!Anyway, for visitors/tourists in Catalonia the situation is as follows:  - Supermarkets, pharmacies, tobacconists and hairdressers remain open (yes, hairdressers!, if it weren't such a serious matter it'd be laughable, but the incompetence of the Spanish government is such that one needs to be very concerned) - Bars, restaurants, museums, libraries, shops, parks... everything else is to be closed from today and for the next two weeks. - Oddly, food delivery businesses (Glovo, Deliveroo... ) can continue to operate as well (delivering food from where? no restaurants are allowed to be open!). In fairness, Glovo does also deliver food from supermarkets and other items. - Internal transportation (metro, bus, train) will continue to operate at reduced frequencies. It's not advised to use it unless strictly necessary. - Taxis can continue to operate, but it's up to each driver to do so. Some taxi companies: Taxi Class Rent tel.933070707 www.taxiclassrent.com ||| Barnataxi tel. 933222222 www.barnataxi.com ||| Ràdio Taxi 033 tel.933033033 www.radiotaxi033.com ||| Servi-Taxi tel.933 300 300 www.servitaxi.com ||| Taxi Ecològic tel.932783000 http://taxiecologic.com ||| Taxi Amic tel.934208088 www.taxi-amic-adaptat.com ||| Fono-Taxi tel.933001100 http://www.fonotaxi.net/ - Airports remain open albeit it's not clear what airlines are flying in and out at present. Check with yours. - Health services continue to operate normally albeit the system is overloaded. For general questions call 012, if in need of assistance cal 061 and for emergencies 112 (the latter can be used from any mobile phone, that is, local or international SIM card) - People CANNOT wander the streets if it is not to go to any of these businesses, to work at one's office/company and/or to go to a health centre (CAP/clinic/hospital). Fines ranging from 500 to 2000€ could be issued for breaking this emergency decree. If visiting, stay at your hotel/apt! - No groups in the street are allowed. If moving about for any of the above reasons, do so individually. Equally, respect the social distance (1.5m/6 feet) if/when queueing for any reason. - If you have a dog, you can walk him in the proximity of your home only and just for his basic needs. Let me be clear: NO beach, no beer on a terrace, no admiring Gaudí, no strolls. Stay safe, stay indoors and don't be a potential spreader... and don't get fined for acting irresponsibly. And yes, we also have some morons among us so don't be surprised if you come across people acting or behaving as if these rules were not in place.I am not going to further comment on the stupidity of some of these orders nor the impossibility to effectively contain the outbreak with such loose measures. Know that the sentiment of our government here in Catalonia, and many of us citizens, in front of such surrealism is of outrage: the Spanish strip the powers of the Catalan and Basque governments that were acting far more diligently and instead propose a mickeymouse plan.Needless to say that if you were planning to come to Barcelona or anywhere in Catalonia these days, do POSTPONE your plan as you'd need to be confined in your apt/hotel for the length of your stay.As per refunds, this is on a case-by-case basis but most businesses are acting responsibly and offering reasonable arrangements for cancellations: from returning the money to allowing a postponement for a later date.More to follow."
"Terrific update as ever ... you say ""- Oddly, food delivery businesses (Glovo, Deliveroo... ) can continue to operate as well (delivering food from where? no restaurants are allowed to be open!). In fairness, Glovo does also deliver food from supermarkets and other items.""If people are suffering and in a period of self-isolation, at home, they may run out of essentials such as medication and food & drink. Those retail outlets must be able to do deliveries ... if their staff are happy to do so, perhaps with masks provided. CheersAnthony"
"Best wishes, Enric, stay safe. Hoping to return to Barcelona in the fall."

"Well, any news so far?Is sea water good or bad for the virus? I mean, with the swimming season within a month there may be some guidelines; quarantine cannot last forever?"
"No news to report other than we're still in quarantine until (possibly) mid-May. Other than that it'd be speculative to lucubrate whether beaches will be open, under which circumstances, etc..Let's not forget we're not only under quarantine but an ""State of Emergency"" is officially in place so plenty of uncertainties on what's next. Sorry"
Let's wait and see...
