"When they 1st open up.... not the 1/2 ass open up like the Wynn has proposed. I’m talking full blown everything open. Every bar, restaraunt, casino, hotel, motel, strip club, pools, shows, , etc., etc. No restrictions... I’m picturing complete madness. Fun madness. Everyone blowing off steam together after a long lock down. If possible more booze than normal, more people than normal, and more people throwing around money that they can’t afford to lose!"
"I can t see that happening, i see very slow start up after a few months more and more people, maybe in a year and half everything back to a new normal."
It will take a while. There won’t be a grand opening weekend where the Strip is sold out.
No not till next year.
I understand the slow process it might take... I’m just saying when they are finally “open”. It could go the other way though where people have been out of work and not wanting to spend money. I think it will be madness though. I just don’t know when this will happen.
No way
"I just don’t know what will happen. At the heart of the phased reopening is continuing to shelter in place in you are vulnerable and maintain a social distance, so this sort of thing shouldn’t be happening for months if not a year.But, I just kind of have a feeling it could descend into a free for all quite quickly."
"Vegas will be back to normal, but with travel restrictions for other countries, the loss of income/jobs in America, and the public's general level of hysteria it will take a while. Doesn't mean Vegas won't have a fun vibe in a few months, but it won't be packed. Viruses are to 2020 America what Middle Eastern looking people were to 2001 America. It takes a while to get over fear. The only difference is this time, people perceive everyone around them as a potential threat, not just one religion or race of people. Hopefully everyone will come to their senses, fear of the other isn't a good thing.Edited: 8:07 pm, April 21, 2020 "
The CDC came out today to say the winter wave will Ben deadlier so maybe next year things will start going back to somewhat normal. https:/…
"Excellent point PNS. My personal preference for a beer is Tom Hamm’s light house. A great view of downtown San Diego, I am impartial since I got married there too."
"That place looks great. One day Roadtrip. SD is fun, went there for NYE once. A nice not too long drive."
"The CDC is merely speculating CO. Could it be? Sure, it might not be though."
"I think that it will be gradual, and likely VERY gradual.1. A lot of folk impacted very negatively, financially. If it gets down to paying your mortgage, feeding your famili or finding work, I cannot see folk rushing off to LV2. Many will have some degree of fear, related to travel, and crowds.3. LV will also require time, to get up to speed. Obviously, you are asking about when it is 100%, but I see that as being a lengthy process.However, I have been wrong about so much, such as this virus coming from a research lab in Wuhan, so what do I know?Hunt"
"Also, how many folk are just dying to head to Fremont St, drink till they puke, and then fall down in it?I do not see the full opening, as being more than a footnote in history.Hunt"
"Love Tom Ham's Lighthouse. We often stay at the Hilton Harbor Island and it's a short stroll away. Actually have reservations for the BBB on July 4, hoping that happens this year"
"Hunt, that is what I’m talking about!! How many will be so damn tired of being holed up in their homes and ready to blow off steam.... that they just say F it, I’m blowing the family nest egg and heading to Vegas, catching a cab from McCarran to Fremont St or the Strip, and going on a 3 day bender of a lifetime! :)"
"Maybe it will be in 2 months, or 6 months, or a year. Who knows"
"Missed my trip end of March early April, So I am gonna chase the allusive hand pay in July. Will have the money I budgeted to lose last trip, and this trip. Plus a little on the stimulus, I guess that will make my host happy. Hold on to Your Hat, I am coming for you. Time to give me a hand pay..."
Vegas will unlikely be the same pre coronavirus for quite awhile...perhaps mid 2021
"With the stuff I'm seeing on social media (and even here), I'm shocked by just how scared some people are. Some people are talking about staying home until there is a vaccine. We're talking a year, year and a half, maybe more. Now, many of those people might change their mind between now and then, but it seems like there are a lot of people who are willing to stay at home for a long time to come.People who are scared to even leave the house to buy toilet paper (oh wait, can't find any anyway) probably won't be boarding a plane -- much less a plane that's headed for a place like Las Vegas -- anytime soon.Plus, people are broke...or are well on their way to it. It is unimaginable what is happening to our economy right now. I'm no economist, but I think this is going to be more devastating than many people realize. It's only beginning, and it's going to get worse and worse each day until everything is open again. People from all walks of life are or will be affected by this."
Football season 2021 is about when I optimistically but reasonably expect fans back in the stands and thus a full go Las Vegas. That sounds fun.
"From an alternative point of view, my husband said he thinks Vegas will be slammed within a week or two of reopening. He says I'm not the only one who is stir-crazy and ready to head out there, and he pointed to the recently re-opened Florida beaches as evidence. He has a point, I think."
"I reckon next summer it'll be absolutely heaving with close to record numbers of visitors. Before that, I kind of doubt it."

You know exactly what PnS is talking about. And who said anything about Israel one way or another?
Comparing dealing with a virus in a responsible way as a means of protecting high risk loved ones to racist Islamophobia is rather odious if you ask me.
"I see Las Vegas being sane and disciplined for some time to come. People will get used to disciplines such as social distancing. I notice it now with the way I walk about in public, I'm constantly looking around me at anyone getting close and avoiding them. I don't get tired of it; it's my new lifestyle.The same will happen in Las Vegas; the people going there will subconsciously take to the new disciplines."
"""You know exactly what PnS is talking about.""Yes, he's comparing fear of people from the Middle East to a virus. Truly a bizarre comparison. He also says our ""fear"" changed in 2001. So before 2001 we ""feared Middle Easterners"" and after 2001 we didn't? It doesn't even make any sense.""And who said anything about Israel one way or another?""Did you miss where I said they too are Middle Easterners? Were they also ""feared"" before 2001?Don't try to defend the undefendable.Edited: 10:46 am, April 22, 2020 "
"A bit of history. Spanish flu also hit early in the year, death toll was light. In the Fall it came back rapidly and more deadlier. Upwards to 50 million million died, 650k in America.I believe that is why the CDC is cautious about the 2nd wave coming this Fall. So Vegas may open but then may close again if that happens. Hopefully not."
"@LindaDon't even bother. It's ironic hater thinks I hate Israel. I donate to Chabad when I can and am a supporter of Bibi Netanyahu/Israel. I've also attended temple many times as a child with a friend of the family. I was just as comfortable there as I would be in church. I'm Catholic BTW. Actually I've probably been to temple more in my life than many secular and probably even a few religious Jews. Also ironic is how the left spent the last two decades bringing up Isamophobia, perceived instances or real ones, yet when I bring it up and therefore acknowledge that yes, people did in many cases look at Middle Eastern/Muslims or even Sikhs with contempt or fear I get put down as racist. This BTW is a very apt comparison. One could also look at how the Germans were before WW2. People in scrubs being yelled at for being in public, Asians getting beaten because someone thinks they are automatically infected. Crossing the street because you don't want someone ""unclean"" coming near you. Discussions of antibody cards, isolation outside the home for the sick, etc. Very similar behavior to what happened in Germany with the Jews in the 30's/40's and anyone who happened to look Middle Eastern in 2001 and for a few years after. Now granted, in Germany things went much much father, but humanity still has its baser instincts. Fear tends to override rational thought and compassion. Group hysteria is even worse because people feed off of that anger and darkness from each other, they reinforce it. This is why normal, rational people will join a riot. It is animalistic behavior. You are right, there is a lot of fear out there. I vastly underestimated people on that. I've learned from that error."

"And isn’t Israel a very racist country. I know it is for safety reasons. Doesn’t El Al use racial profiling effectively to protect their passengers and property. They do have arrangements in other countries to provide their own security. Have there not been many law suits against them for not allowing people especially Palestinians on their flights? Also, weather pro Israel or not they don’t have a great track record on civil rights. Let’s not get into a racist debate you pilled out the race card here. And calling out PNS makes you the racist."

Cry me a river and get a life...
"Not crying, just like CNN, and not Fox ""News"", pointing out the truth using your, and PnS's, OWN words."
"FLW - I don't think anyone said Israel wasn't in the Middle East. I don't think anyone mentioned Israel at all. I was just confused about why you brought up Israel in particular, as opposed to, say, Afghanistan or Iraq or Iran."
I think what FLW was referring to was the weeks following 9/11. People were treated differently because of how they looked.
"I thought PnS was the first one to bring that up....and FLW accused him of being racist. Unfortunately, though, it's true...it was a rough time to be a Middle Easterner in the United States, for sure.I'm just curious...why bring up Israel in particular? I'm really feeling like it was brought up as a left-wing vs. right-wing thing."
"@Lin_duh, I was thinking it was a chicken wing thing."
"FLWFan, it is not about the truth with you. You just want to argue."
So why isn’t Israel’s actions racist? And why is PNS racist? Am I racist for asking? Since you know it all please explain. How come I can’t think that this Covid19 is blown out of proportion?
Yum...chicken wings. Flats or drums?
I don't blame you for not defending your OWN words and attacking me instead; it's hard to admit you were wrong. Done. Knock yourself out.

“Done” exactly again. Why do you start a battle then run away. I can admit when I am wrong. Can you?
"All will depend on the testing. If most have had IT already, then the opening will be grand…but will need to have appropriate testing before."
The most recent data suggests that way more people have had it than we originally thought.
Whoa there! Not so fast!
"Well, maybe I am wrong, and the opening will be a big deal?Mayor De Blasio is planning a big parade for healthcare workers, when tmmediately after this is over: https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/493…Wasn’t it not him, and his two top health officials, who urged New Yorkers to crowd in, and celebrate Chinese New Year, just like Speaker Pelosi did for San Francisco?Similar happened in 1918, and the Spanish Flu had a big spike, where the celebrations were held. Maybe there ARE lessons, which history can teach us - if we only listen.Hunt"
"Oops, forgot the second link: https:/…flu-epidemic-hits-philadelphiaHunt"
Good point Hunt
"PnS....sorry, but that is a ludicrous comparison. You are comparing an irrational fear of something that is not health related and was fear based on racism, to a rational fear of dying from the most deadly virus we have seen in our lifetimes, or perhaps even worse, accidentally or negligently killing someone by being selfish and careless. It seems you have an agenda here. You are ok with the # of nurses etc dying and you are ok with it rising? Thankfully the majority of people care enough about their neighbors that they are complying with lockdown guidelines. Here in Australia, we are now down to less than 10 new cases a day cause we're not ruled by morons.As for the post's question, will Vegas be insane? Nah....it will be a slow build up over a year or so, and not before there is a vaccine or treatment available. It will be a long time before overseas visitors are able or willing to go back into America after seeing how poorly the virus has been managed there."
Anyone that wants a test can get a test ..still a lie...fact
And this is why the governments need to impose strict guidelines....sadly there are people like you who just don't get it and are ok with killing people and saying that those of us who are saying you shouldn't be out there possibly killing people are depriving you of your civil liberties. Do you also think people with HIV should be allowed to have unprotected sex without their partner's consent? Or what about those that don't know if they have HIV or not and are carelessly having sexual relations? Cause it sounds to me like that is how you want to behave.

"Odogpa - ""Anyone that wants a test can get a test ..still a lie...fact""Yep, and nothing can safely and responsibly fully re-open until those tests are available.

"@PhoensamSo you are saying there is no backlash against people of Asian descent right now? I live in the Koreatown part of LA, and can assure you there was. Even before the shutdown, many of the restaurants in the area were dead, people were afraid to go in them. While often people will fake racial or for that matter any sort of attack for publicity or to push an agenda, there are also many that were quite real and quite disturbing. I would rather risk getting C-19 than risk a trip where I have the same percentage chance of being harmed in a terrorist attack. Considering the USC study that was just released where apparently 28-55 times more people had the virus already than expected, I probably did have it already. Even if I didn't, there are more pressing concerns to attend to. Tried to get an antibody test last weekend, the place I went to was out. Will keep trying. The more people that get tested, the lower the death rate will go.Edited: 7:46 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"@phoensam, You paint with a broad brush. You know it is possible to make a point without sounding extreme don’t you? You end out looking as silly as those you argue with. I never read anybody saying they were okay with killing anybody. Why would you write that? Most of the debate is about the future, an unknown date that people are debating. Everybody as far as I know is still in quarantine until at least May. The experts have been wrong about so much that anything is up debate. You know what? This forum will not be making the decisions so calm down. OK with Killing people? Really?"
"Phoensam, first of all this is America, I have the right to think whatever the heck I want. Second, the civil liberties is in regards to the right of THINKING that this is blown out of proportion. Has nothing to do with social distancing. So I can’t question it. This was on ongoing debate with a troll. I understand the concept of what is best for the community. So get your facts straight. Yes if you have aids and spread it is unconscionable. Funny how a liberals views are on civil liberties...."
"I think the Aussie is FLWFan in disguise, did he steal your bag?"
"“So lucky here in Australia, they are practically begging you to get tested”Australia has about 350 million less people. Can’t really compare the 2. Glad everything is going good there though. For real. Hopefully we will get there sooner rather than later. Geez what’s happening on all these threads? A lot of angry people"
"@5RedPeople are angry because they are tired, stressed about things, whether it is catching the virus, being unemployed or the possibility of it happening, other financial concerns, loss of civil liberties, and frankly just being cooped up at home too much. When you keep piling stress on people they snap. It is a lot easier to be mean to someone online than it is someone face to face. There are generally really nice people behind each screen here, but stress and the internet just brings out the anger."

I find it easier to be mean to people face to face as long we are both wearing a mask that is.

"lin-duh: The most recent data suggests that way more people have had it than we originally thought.That doesn't seem to matter. People are reportedly being re-infected (though that could be false-positives from the tests), and there are potentially 30+ mutations out there, which would render vaccine immunisation a nigh-impossibility."
Just to get back to the post.....I think there will be thousands returning and throwing caution to the wind after a few pops. Life is about choices. The vast majority will still be gripped by fear and stay home. The academics and politicians successfully manipulated the population (for the most part) to create that fear and begin containment. Whether or not it was necessary or the timing was late will be debated for decades. Problem we have up here is they have no visible clue about what to do next. At some point the fear mongering will become ineffective without a clear plan and execution moving forward.
"I think there is a certain element that will be out of control as soon as they can be and maybe even before that. Personally I won't be back until the restaurants are fully open. It will be interesting to see if buffets change.On the off topic chatter about civil liberties, I think people, especially those who have not been living in the more extreme places of shutdown don't get it. On Kauai they have set up roadblocks where men in high knee boots demand to see your papers.Okay, so I made up the high knee boots part, but it's only because they are on back order. The rest is true.It is one thing to quarantine a sick person, but quite another to suspend crucial freedoms of people who are not."
"scottca how can you make a pair of flip-flops that are knee high ?Edited: 9:44 am, April 26, 2020 "
"IMO open it up completely or not at all. Trying to regulate how many people to let into casinos, bars, restaurants etc sounds like a nightmare. Can you imagine saying no to 5 drunk guys wanting entry somewhere? Lol. Keep it closed until it can be fully open."

"I think it all depends on what this COVID 19 ends up being. I have this feeling that it's going to kind of end up like the titanic movie where everyone kept walking around and playing with the chunks of ice that fell on the deck not knowing what was really happening. Once we get to the part where the cabins are flooding and people start to realize how real this thing is I think Vegas will be a ghost town until it ends.Or maybe it's been exaggerated and by June we see that it was much ado about nothing (not likely). I can't think of anywhere better to intentionally infect yourself with something than Vegas (or any large resort). Not putting that on the casino's or resorts, it's just that there is such a massive volume of people constantly contaminating surfaces you'd have to be misting the place with bleach from sprinklers just to keep them sanitized."
Once there is a vaccine... yes! I think it will be completely insane! Until there is a vaccine... no. Not under social distancing circumstances.
"Hey guys! We are looking to return to Las Vegas for Labour day 2021, first off..1) are we most likely going to be back to normal? 2) never been on labour day we usually go for a week later in September, is the crowd a little younger? We went for Mexican independence weekend and it wasnt overly busy and the crowd seemed largely elder. We are a group of 26-29 year old English lads, and we had an insane time last time! Thanks guys, take care."
"#811 - No one really knows I guess, but jeez, in 18 months I would hope so.2 - Younger? Not sure, but it is definitely more expensive that weekend. If you can go the week before it would save a bunch of money, pool parties would still be in full swing (assuming Vegas has returned to its normally scheduled programming).Edited: 2:06 pm, May 13, 2020 "
"Under normal times I've always said you should never be concerned about Vegas being too slow or dead at any point. Even the ""slow"" times offer more than enough excitement for whatever your heart's desire. Pools being the exception of course.Under the current scenario of course it will be different with the full ""Vegas"" experience not returning until we have a vaccine widely distributed. Which I hope to god is by September 2021.I'm optimistic in this regard, and this of course is pure speculation, but as someone with no interest in returning before a vaccine, I'm thinking March Madness will be when I do."
