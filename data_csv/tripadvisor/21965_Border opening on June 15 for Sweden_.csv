"When the German borders open on June 15, does it also apply for Sweden or just some EU countries? Recently some other EU countries has insisted on bullying us for having a slightly different and should I say controversial methods in fighting the coronavirus, by simply banning entry for Swedish citizens (illegal discrimination of EU citizens!). I would like to know, can Swedes travel freely to Germany on June 15? I do not speak German so I have no good access to German news where I can read about these things. Thanks.Edited: 6:18 pm, June 16, 2020 "
"That applies to some landside borders that have been closed. Afaik the sea- and airways between Sweden and Germany have always stayed open. Not all German states allow EU citizens (or travelers in general) to stay as tourists yet, though, so it would depend on where you want to go to. Also keep in mind that the Swedish government has issued a worldwide travel warning till July."
"The air and sea border is kind of not open as of now cause other EU citizens has to go into quarantine when they arrive if they are let in at all. So my question is rather, will we have to quarantine?Edited: 6:22 pm, June 16, 2020 "
"Just a suggestion, you should direct your questions to the Swedish Embassy or government department dealing with travel. They possibly have a website where you could read policies regarding Covid19 and travel. Good luck, safe travels."
The mandatory quarantine is suspended for EU citizens unless you come from an area with more than 50 new infections per 100K over the last seven days. Sweden is just under that rate at the moment - but the highest in the EU. https:/…coronavirus-faqs.htmlhttps://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuart…
"Well, that makes it impossible to book a holiday then. EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson (who by conincidence is Swedish by the way) just said that Schengen borders everywhere should be entirely open by the end of June at the latest. Like it was before, no checks, no passports. But somehow I think some countries will not comply with that. https://polandin.com/48400461/eu-commissione…Edited: 6:23 pm, June 16, 2020 "
"As much as I wish it was the case, I'm afraid we won't see that happening and there will be some restriction this summer. I would also like to know what will the restrictions be after 15th of June, as I'd like to take a flight from Munich airport in late June, but I can't find any definitive information whether I'll be able to reach the airport.Edited: 12:18 pm, June 07, 2020 "
"So the borders today are open to all of the EU without quarantine except people from Sweden due to German states following German Government recommendations to not do so. I am so disappointed. It surprises me that Germany of all countries refuses to follow the EU recommendations to open the border to all EU citizens indiscriminately today, June 15 with an open Schengen. Like it was before the crisis started. https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/…Anyway, I now booked a holiday in Sweden instead, as I sadly will not be able to go to Germany. Maybe planning a visit to Poland as well, who opened all Schengen borders indiscriminately today, without exceptions, without quarantine.Edited: 6:23 pm, June 16, 2020 "
"Well, Sweden has daily new infections equaling the numbers of Italy, Spain, France and Germany COMBINED, countries multiple times larger, countries that fought hard to get off the infection rates Sweden has reached now with its rather easy-going approach, so it doesn’t really come as a surprise. Better safe than sorry."
"It mainly has to do with recently introduced mass testing, that so many new infections are shown now. Actually it has decreased alot, for a couple of weeks ago, it was 50 deaths per day, now its about 20 per day, and cases in intensive care has decreased alot also. There is now more testing than in many other countries.So most likely (considering there was twice as many deaths), there were alot more infections a month ago, even if it doesn't look like that in the statistics cause there was much less testing back then, when they mainly tested people who were admitted to hospitals."
"i mentioned it in another post that the threshold inside Germany triggering an automatic lockdown is 50 cases per 100,000 people in an area over 7 days. This has now taken priority over tracking the ""R"" numbers when infection rates are so low (and the R number fluctuating so much). This number isnt a discrimination against any particular country, its used in cities and states internally in Germany. Germany now averages 2 cases per 100,000 people Sweden is over 50 cases per 100,000 people It is lovely for people in Sweden that they can live freely and choose a different path than the rest of Europe but the fact is that the recorded virus rate is 25 times more prevalent there than in Germany Heres a nice map of Europe tracking how prevalent Covid is in each country, over the past 7 days. The only country where the virus is currently in the red zone is Sweden. The UK is not far behind but hasn't hit that magic 50 number. https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuart…"
"I guess it's a side effect of mass testing. Many people outside Sweden has the impression that life was completely normal in Sweden during the worst part of the pandemic but that just isn't true. There was and still is a limit of no public gatherings of more than 50 people and restaurants has to enforce social distancing. Amusement parks are not allowed to open and they don't allow any festivals or concerts (with an audience bigger than 50). It's a very odd situation for us. Countries that more or less closed their borders to us are Germany, Denmark, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands and many others.But those who opened for us on the other hand regardless of our high infection rate, without any quarantine, are Poland, Serbia, Kosovo, Belarus and Albania. Also Spain and Italy."

"Not trolling. Spain is opening the border to all EU citizens indiscriminately. Here is the policy of every country in the EU. It appears mainly Sweden and Luxembourg has defended keeping Schengen Area open the entire time. https:/…Edited: 6:22 pm, June 16, 2020 "
"You are aware that a Schengen state can suspend the open border for a whole host of reasons, including public health? It doesn't matter what the Commission says, the state has control.Edited: 2:47 pm, June 16, 2020 "
"Yes, and I did not claim anything else. I didn't say it was unlawful. Only that the EU recommends that the entire Schengen Area open by June 15 for inter-European travel, and that the external borders open by July 1. Here is a nice map that shows who has followed the EU recommendation to open their borders to everyone in the EU. Only 8 of them are green. Germany is labeled green also, so it seems like the creators of the map hasn't taken the German state policies into account. The 7 others does not have restrictions. https://reopen.europa.eu/enRe-open EU is a website started by the European Commission to support re-opening the EU.Edited: 6:24 pm, June 16, 2020 "
"@Mange_H Traveller: On the website https://reopen.europa.eu/en, Germany is labeled green only for the question ""From an EU country or from Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein, may I enter or exit this country for tourism?"" . If you click on the yellow house which stands for ""May I enter this country without being subject to a mandatory quarantine?"", Germany will turn yellow. However it is true that the text does not take in account the current rule for EU-countries, which may also be submitted to a quarantine.Edited: 3:53 pm, June 16, 2020 "

"Accusing an user of this without any evidence is really against what this forum is for. In this topic, so far, it is him asking for travel advice and you arguing about how naughty Sweden is, and how it deserves to have their citizens punished. I could discuss coronavirus policy all day here but it is not what matters.Regardless, as for travel advice: the sea border (together with the borders with Belgium and Netherlands, strangely the most affected countries) has never closed. I crossed it twice during the pandemic, in mid march and early June. I never spotted any sort of check. I have no idea how quarantines only for Swedes will be imposed and enforced. Nor what they are expecting to achieve, other than looking nice: infections per 100k foremost reveal to what extent the country is testing and even countries with the most massive and efficient test systems admit that they are missing up to 90% of the infections.I come to Germany because of family reasons, and as a tourist, with so many uncertainties, the best would be to go somewhere else regardless."
"A bit more hopeful now the border will get opened. Denmark just opened for most countries in the EU, including Sweden (for the southern regions of the country, starting on June 27), without quarantine. So it seems this Re-Open EU campaign by the European Commission is starting to have an effect! Not only that but also, people from southern Sweden (and north-western Germany) will in Denmark not be obliged to book at least 6 nights, unlike people from other countries. https://www.thelocal.se/20200618/denmark-ope…I will only travel to Germany if German law allows me to, as a sign of respect I will not travel to a country who doesn't want me to be there. To anyone who says it's irrelevant what other countries do, well, it's not irrelevant. We are all in the EU and countries take inspiration from each others."
