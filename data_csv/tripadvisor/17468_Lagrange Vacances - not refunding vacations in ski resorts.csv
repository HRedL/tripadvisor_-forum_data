"Guyswe are struggling to get the refund from these guys.They closed Les Gets ski resort, Les fermes EMINGUY resort from LAGRANGE and all flights cancelled.Still they dont want to give us the money back.We booked through their website , that was our mistake.People that booked from booking.com are getting full refunds because Booking.com pushed them.Anyone had the same experience? they stopped answering mails, customer service not replying their phone number is not available anymore.Really unprofessional guys,"
