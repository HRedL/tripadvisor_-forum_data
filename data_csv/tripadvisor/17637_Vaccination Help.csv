"We're staying in Bentota in April - we are travelling from UK, can anyone tell me if we need vaccinations and also in this part of SL do we need to take anti malaria tablets?Elmogum x"
"HiOk, so there is 2 parts to your question, so firstly:Malaria pills:You do NOT need to take these IF you are planning to stay in and around the Bentota area, yes there are some ""mozzies"" especially after sunset, but NOT Malarial though, you should of course take precautions to stop yourself getting bitten, like wearing long attire over arms and legs in outdoor areas after sunset, and using a repellant too, try using the Autan roll on type, it is excellent.The hotel rooms are usually mozzie free, epecially if you keep air con on at night.Vaccinations:YES!! you do need to have these, and if you contact your local GP, these are usally FREE to travellers to Sri Lanka, i cannot remember the exact ones, but they will tell you what you should have.Hope this helps, but anyway, have a great time in Sri Lanka, it is a fab country, and it's people will be very pleased to see you, and will make you feel very welcome too.Dave"
"I had already contacted my GP and what he said is as follows:Rabies £151Tick borne encephalitis £145Japanese encephalitis £95Yellow fever £60This doesnt match up to what the holiday brochure says, they recommend typhoid, hepatitis, polio and tuberculosis.Theres hardly any way I can afford to pay the prices for those vaccinations, especially since there are 2 of us going so it's doubled! Has anyone one else had vaccinations and what prices did you pay? (To add to that I'm a NHS patient not a private patient).ThanksE"
"EYour GP is having a laugh, and trying to make money too, you do NOT!!! need ANY!!! of the ones that he is trying to charge you for, but, yes you DO need the ones that you have stated, and these are FREE on the NHS.I would report your GP for trying to mislead you, and trying to make money too.TELL your GP, to refer to the NHS guidelines for the correct vaccinations!Dave"
I would agree with travellerguy. Sadly many GP's see this as a wasy to make money. The only thing i would add is possibly a rabies shot. But we didnt bother.Def dont need malaria
"This is the bizarre thing - the Dr typed up the sheet of what we needed and attached some stuff he had downloaded off of the net from www.travax.scot.nhs.uk and the info on that sheet says 1) Infections that should be covered by vaccinations recommended for life in britain eg. boosters inc. hep B, 2) Infections for vaccination is usually advised (or boosters if necessary) Hep A, Poliomyelitis, Tetanus and Typhoid 3) Vaccination Certificates - Yellow fever if travelling from an infected area 4) Infections for which vaccination is advised in SPECIAL CIRCS (If long stay is mentioned below it is usually for a period of 1 months or more) Cholera, Diptheria, Hep B and Jap B Encephalitis, Rabies and TB,So now I'm confused and think I may have to call and enquire as to why they have put stuff on the sheet which is recommended for stays over a month and other stuff which isnt even mentioned!Although staying in Bentota we were thinking of going up to Kandy - I presume we would need Anti Malaria for this?Thanks so much for help!E "
"The yellow fever, is as is often the case, is only required if comming from an infected area, and the uk isnt one.You dont need anti malaria for kandy either. The mossies of Sri Lanka, carry dengue fever, but there is no jab for this. "
"One thing to bear in mind Elmogum is that none of the vaccinations are compulsory for a traveller arriving from Great Britain - so it's entirely up to you what you have , sensible people will certainly have Typhoid and Hepatitis but any thing else is entirely up to you."
Thanks everyone - I will contact our Dr's tomorrow and speak to them about getting the Hep A and typhoid injections.E 
"Hi,Travelling to Sri Lanka in 2 weeks, have just had typhoid, hep A, and top up tetnus jabs..OUCH :( was advised to take malaria tabs but make sure you don't get the one's that make you hallucinate (Larama) or something like that name, they are shockers,had them when we went to Borneo.Have a fab time in SL, I know we will, can't wait.Cheers,Tracey"
"There hasnt been a oybreak of malaria in Sri Lanka since the 1950,s"
"Yes, no OUTBREAK of Malaria for the last 50 years or so, but still every year tens of cases including a few deaths!However restricted to specific areas, probably mentioned earlier: Cultural Triangle (and further north from there but that's not for tourists...) and dry zone from Uduwalawe to Yala. If one stays in EVENING there one should be cautious against malaria. Either with extreme care for mozzies, and good doctor contacts as a backup, or by using one of the the profylaxe - which indeed have side-effects, some of them (Lariam) very nasty ones...Regards,<Erik> & [Sandya]"
"Thanks for all your help - I've today made an appointment with the nurse at the Dr's surgery for Friday afternoon so I'll see what she says. I'm going to try and just get Hep A and Tyhoid as well as making sure my other boosters are up to date.I've been advised by a friend who is a Dr and has also worked in SL to take anti malarials, just in case. I'll speak with the nurse about this Friday also.Thanks for everyones input!E "
"Foodborne and waterborne diseases are common throughout the area, in particular cholera and other watery diarrheas, the dysenteries, typhoid fever, hepatitis A and E, and helminthic infections. Large epidemics of hepatitis E can occur. Giardiasis is common in the area."
"Hi Rister,Yes - true what you write but most of it not applicable at all to tourists. Diseases like Cholera simply do not happen if one has access to cooked/filtered water and if the drainage system is good enough - which it always is for tourist hotels/guesthouses.So back to the original conclusion: go to nurse and get advice on the basic vaccinations. AFIK DTP, Typhoid and Hepatitis A and 'optionally' (depending on the region of staying in Lanka) malaria...Regards,<Erik> & [Sandya]"
"I'm glad you think the drainage system is always good in Sri Lanka. ;-) Trip Advisor advises to all travellers even backpackers etc. which don't always have access to sterile environments. So unless the water you drink is boiled in front of you......your risk!! Girdisis a very underestimated disease, you can get from swimming in a lake (Bentota). Believe me I have had quite a few diseases living and holidaying in Sri Lanka for the past 46 years. "
"Oh yes... from the viewpoint of a local, and doing things reserved for locals, there are lots of more risks. But then every risk and vaccination does have some side-effects.So when advising a 'standard' tourist, I try to stick to the diseases normally applicable for them. Have never had problems with drinking water from the mineral-water bottles (check the seal!), swimming in sea and 'streaming' river mouths (including Bentota lagoon) and the like for the last 13 years...<Erik>"
