My husband and I are planning on buying a newAudi and doing European delivery.So that means we will be travelling to Barcelona in a new Audi convertible. So many friends who know Barcelona have told us our car is going to be stolen. We will only be in Barcelona for 4-5 days. Do you think we should not go to Barcelona for this reason. Also is there any paid parking lot that would be more safe than street parking or just a lot we would drive in on chance. Thanks for your help.
get new friends.
Remember you require an international driver's license for Spain.
A quick glance at Google Streetview will demonstrate that there are no cars left in Barcelona. Best to believe your friends.
"By now you probably realize your friends were selling you nonsense, but let's try to sort this out a little. Onstreet parking: tough even for residents who know the nooks and crannies. Paid attended parking: can be full in popular areas; not cheap; make a reservation. Risk: same as parking downtown in a big city in Florida. You omit your location but I assume you at least vaguely know Miami, Tampa or some other decent size city. Would you leave a brand new convertible parked on the street in downtown Tampa for 5 days and not expect that, even if not stolen, there would be a good chance the top would be slashed or the sides defaced, or just that some idiot would back into it trying to parallel park? Barcelona is not some strange place; it's Florida with better food and less humidity. Just do the sensible thing and find yourself secure parking, and then tell your friends not to offer advice when they don't know what they are talking about. (If you gives us a hint where you are staying we can probably suggest some specific places.)Edited: 3 years ago "
You can buy insurance from Audi for $280 for 30 days. Why not just pick up the insurance and not worry about it?
Thanks for some good tips. The insurance sound the best so far. We wouldn't leave it in one place for 5 days we would drive it and/or put it in a garage. I live outside of Tampa. Tampa is a very safe city. Miami has state run parking lots so the price is cheaper. Thanks again.
"Why wouldn't you leave it in one place? You certainly don't want to drive a car in Barcelona except to get in and out of town. BTW, there is an auto theft epidemic in Tampa. Doesn't sound very safe to me. tampabay.com/projects/…"
"More likely to be damaged! Parking in Spain is not the best I've seen, doors are flung open, bumpers scraped etc."
"As mentioned, you'll have no problem with your car in Barcelona )at least no more than in other places) but there is no point in using the car here so find a car park and leave your car there.You canuse websites like these to find a well located and reasonably priced car park.Remember to check the location and the available public transport near the car park.www.meparking.es/ciudad/parking-barcelona/parkandflybcn.com/content/c%C3%B3mo-llegar-p…https://parclick.com/search?q=Barcelona,+Spain danilou21, as an expert on parking in Spain we appreciate your observations but next time just try and think of all the ""professional"" observations you've heard over the years on the UK."
"Why don't you pick up the car after the stay in Barcelona? As said, you don't need it in the city and that way you don't have to worry..."
Thanks again for your help. The parking lots are really what I am looking for. Thanks again.I really had no idea Tampa had this car theft issue. I go weekly to Tampa and do street parking and never had a problem! What a shame these kids are ruining their lives over cars. Thanks again
Your car will not be stolen. Of course anything can happen but it's unlikely. The worst that could happen is you return with a dent in your car. Here people try to park their car in spaces that seem unimaginable for most and I have witnessed several incidents of where drivers will do their upmost to squeeze into any space with complete disregard for other vehicles . Better finding a parking lot instead of street parkingEdited: 3 years ago
