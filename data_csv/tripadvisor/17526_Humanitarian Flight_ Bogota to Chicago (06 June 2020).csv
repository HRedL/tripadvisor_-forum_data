"This is for U.S. Citizens and Permanent Aliens. The flight will operate on 06 June 2020 and will be operated by Viva. If you are an American Citizen or permanent resident Alien, look on the web site of the ACS in the U.S. Embassy in Bogota. This was in an email they sent out on 02 June 2020. This is the first time I have ever seen a Humanitarian flight to Chicago or on Viva."
Not sure a flight from Colombia back to US would be considered humantarian - better to stay put and take one's chances.
Lanny post is informational but given not only the ongoing world wide epidemic (CV) but now also the protests in the US I too would not return for a visit to Los Angeles anytime in the near future.
"RE: Replies 1 and 2I agree with both of you. First, I believe there is a (much?) lower chance of getting the Covid-19 Coronavirus here in Colombia and secondly the recent violence in the USA. The violence is especially horrible and sad.However, I suspect there are people who for one reason or another need to return to the USA and for them, the ""Humanitarian"" flights are a blessing."
Well I’m sure some people think the less locked-down US is an attractive alternative and they’d rather take their chances!
Any idea how much the flight would cost?
"RE: Reply #5Well that flight from BOG to ORD was 3 days ago, but if my memory is correct the U.S. Embassy indicated approximately $450 USD. Probably depended upon how many passengers were sharing the cost of the flight."
