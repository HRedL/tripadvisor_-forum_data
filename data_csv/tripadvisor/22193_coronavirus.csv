"Hi from Britain, Hope all of you are coping in these unimaginable times , total lockdown here same as you, panic buying is a disgrace and the weather is still cold. Will be flying to Corralejo as soon as this crisis allows. Dont panic Paul."
"The uk is not on the same level of lockdown as spain and its islands, though clearly the same sort of restrictions may apply soon."
"To the above post....Paul A was only wishing everyone well , i would like to do the same to , take care everyone."
"They don't seem to be taking it so seriously in the UK, tho more so now. Here, the military are stopping people all the time. You have to justify where you're going and why. I'm hearing we're not even being allowed to choose where we shop now. People from El Cotillo who wanted to shop in Mercadona have been turned back. And only dog-walkers are allowed out for a walk, just a couple of hundred metres max.Absolutely no panic buying here. Very few shoppers at all, in fact, and everything available (with the usual day-to-day island shortages of fresh produce). But shopping is not a nice experience at all. Security guards tell you what to wear, where to stand, when you can move, what you can or can't touch... It takes ages! I was thinking of getting fresh stuff regularly but now I've done one shop I'm happy to stick with tinned and frozen veg.My husband claimed the job of taking the recycling to the bins yesterday. He even got to say hello to someone. I was really envious!Edited: 7:08 am, March 22, 2020 "
"At #2 merely pointing out that the situation regarding lockdown is still very different, those thinking that what restrictions apply in spain are those in place in the uk now may be in for a shock in the coming weeks.Atb steve.Edited: 7:23 am, March 22, 2020 "
@SheilaW34 You are quite right. The eyes of the rest of Europe are on us in the UK and cannot quite believe what they are seeing. Too much is being left to the responsibility of individuals and it isn't working. Tougher action in terms of restriction of movement will need to happen soon.Good luck.GW
"We are pretty much free to do what we want here in the uk .They closed bars but every one just meets up in someone's home and carry on regardless. Its scary to be honest , alot of folk in the uk aren't taking this seriously."
"And no doubt a lot are taking it seriously, even when further restrictions are imposed there will be some that think it only applies to others.Media reports in spain indicate they forced hundreds of motorists to turn round and return to their homes in interior cities/towns on friday/sat after trying to get to coastal holiday homes in the costa del sol, even near martial law will not dissuade everybody.Atb steve"
Some bars in the UK are refusing to close and the police don't yet have the authority to force them.
If a bar refuses to close then they should be prosecuted because they are putting money before public safety.
"The closure of pubs/clubs ect is an order from the highest political level, the PM, it is not backed by legistlation at this stage so however irresponsible those places that remain open are ( not that i am aware of any) what would they be prosecuted for?Edited: 10:37 am, March 22, 2020 "
"i was just making a point , thats what i wish would happen to the bar owners for staying open and putting the £ before people health .I take it you like an argument by the way you write your posts ."

"Hello gary , its not an argument that i look for, but merely clarity and factual information, as said no law exists but i too believe people including publicans should act responsibly and follow all appropriate orders/requests.As pointed out the earlier the uk still has some way to go before reaching the same level of restrictions and means of implementing them as spain, other factual information that for some reason you don't like.Atb steve"
"On the contrary, i like the measures that countries like spain have implemented i just wish that the British government would do the same ."
"Lets hope yourself and everybody else can sustain for a decent period those measures when, as is likely they are introduced."
The sooner the UK goes into lockdown the better .
"Apparently the police in Scotland have the powers to close any licensed premises for 24 hours under the licencing laws They are now doing this to any pub trying to stay open and will repeat the 24 hours ad nauseum if they have to. The enforcement order has to be signed by the Chief Constable and is notified to the local licensing board, who can revoke their licence if they deem it necessary. I'm assuming the rest of the UK has similar powers."
"Yes that was the means to enforce it if neccessary mentioned in the media when the order was made, it consumes time that would be better spent on more positive things to control the spread.Those stupid enough to keep pubs open should lose their licences for good if that is possible, but even that is further down the line.Atb steve"
"Here in the Canaries, you obey the new rules or else. For example, if you saw the video of the holidaymaker on TF who refused to get out of the hotel pool and was removed forcibly, she apparently spent the night in jail."
Selfish Londoner takes Coronavirus into rural community. Idiot!
SheliaThat lady swimmer is a labour politician in the UK .
"Joanne Rust is a Labour councillor and Unison campaign organiser from King’s Lynn, Norfolk, For the last three General Elections, she has stood as Labour’s candidate for Norfolk North-West"
jenandrich-hopefully soon to be EX councillor. Deplorable behaviour.Another case probably of do you know who I am? I can do/say what I like. WRONG!!!! Actions such as those which she did have consequences & rightly so.

"Wow, I'm amazed at that news. I'm sure none of us expect or want our MPs to behave like that. She certainly doesn't deserve anyone's vote."
Are the ferries running between Fuerteventura and Lanzarote? Trying to get flight home from there instead of Fuerteventura
"Yes, the car ferries are running a restricted service for those who have a justifiable reason to travel. You would qualify.There's also one flight per day FUE to MAD and three to LPA.There are ways to get home if you're prepared to be flexible. Check out the British Embassy website and their ""Brits in Spain"" Facebook page. On the latter there are charts of rescue flights, mostly operated by BA. Don't wait for Ryanair, Easyjet, etc. They simply aren't operating. Their ""Next available flight"" will probably be cancelled in due course.Good luck!"
I'm talking about Charlie Windsor.
