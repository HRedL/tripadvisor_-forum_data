We are spending a couple of nights at Iguazu in mid Feb and need to know if we should be taking anti malarial meds? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
"If you read the CDC guidelines then it will show this area for possible malaria. However, if you are plannning on visiting the Iguazu Falls Parks then there is no worries. Just take along some good insect repellent.If you were going into some extended jungle trips into some of the remote areas of Brazilian jungle then you should consult your physician for guidelines.Some countries, I think Australia requires their passport holders to have documented coverage when traveling to this area."
"No, not that I know..."
DEET inspect repellent is what you should have -- and USE it. Dengue fever is more of a reality and the only prevention for that is not getting bitten by the mosquito in the first place.
Thanks for your swift & helpful answers....pro insect repelent it is
If visiting Foz soon I would get a Yellow Fever vaccination. The area is an epidemic area. We are Americans living in Brazil and there has recently been some deaths due to the disease in our area. We are about 5 hours from Foz and are technically not an epidemic area. It is just better to be safe for something so serious.
