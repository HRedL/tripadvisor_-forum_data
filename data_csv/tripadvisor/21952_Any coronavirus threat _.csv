Hi guys please post if someone knows about coronavirus threat in Mauritius !
This article was on one of the news sites that I looked at this morning. Sounds like they are being very proactive in Mauritius.https://translate.google.com/translate…
"Not as yet but the authorities have people in quarantine.56 people are in quarantine in Mauritius, according to the latest figures communicated by the Ministry of Health. All are in good health, according to the ministry.29 are at the center of Anse-la-Raie and 27 others at Souillac hospital. Mauritians in quarantine in France should return to the country in a week.The authorities noted that tourism from Asia is down 15%.Mauritius usually attracts large numbers of Chinese tourists."
"Thanks, Bronia. Once again the link to Defi didn't go to the actual article. Must remember to double check!!!"
Dee it's a pain. Links using translate used to go directly to the article but now it either goes to the whole newspaper or the article in French.Would love to know why!
Thanks for the information....so it’s all safe out there ?
As of today it is. No reported cases of the virus.
"Be assured no case till now, and i think measures have already been taken by our government to tackle incase we get any isolated cases."
"Sure my friend. Safe as heaven :)Edited: 10:57 am, February 11, 2020 "
Thanks guys
"Report in Defi today says An Alitalia plane carrying 300 passengers was blocked earlier today by Mauritius authorities.According to the Milan-based newspaper Corriere della Sera, the authorities in Mauritius initially told all passengers that they could disembark only if they agreed to be quarantined in hospitals.The plane which took off from Rome included 30 passengers from Lombardy and Veneto.Finally, they let all passengers disembark without quarantine, with the exception of those from Lombardy and Veneto and said that the plane must return to Italy in the afternoon.https://defimedia.info/coronavirus-un-avion-…"
"Yikes :OInsurance would reimburse, but wouldn't fancy the back to back long haul flight with kids :(Presuming it went back with just those 30 passengers I hope they let them use the 1st/BC seats.Edited: 7:53 am, February 24, 2020 "
"Frusci the Mauritius Ministry of Health are now denying reports in the foreign press that the Alitalia flight from Italy was blocked in Mauritius.In a statement issued on Monday afternoon February 24, the Ministry of Health said that ""the passengers were screened, according to established protocols.""Some have been placed in quarantine, others have been able to reach their respective hotels,"" said the Ministry of Health in its press release.https://defimedia.info/coronavirus-le-minist…Express also has this story:https://www.lexpress.mu/article/370871/vol-d…""Passengers on this flight were placed in quarantine. Others have been able to reach their hotel but will have to comply with “community surveillance”.So what's the truth?Edited: 8:17 am, February 24, 2020 "
"Who knows, these days. In the past I would have said it can't be totally fabricated. But these days mainstream media feel so much pressure to fill the pages, they just run with stories and check later :DGuess we'll find out in due course. But this sort of thing is the bigger concern for me right now. Countries getting nervous and doing strange things. Meaning you get stuck somewhere or turned back."
You travel soon I think and I fly to Athens in under 3 weeks and Mauritius in early June.It certainly makes you think.
Asian market will decrease further i think since we dont have direct flights to China
Asian market will decrease further i think since we dont have direct flights to China-------------------------Yes MK finally stopped flights as have most airlines.
"Yes we're leaving end of March from London.My other concern is I've booked too soon and prices drop :) I know I shouldn't look now i've booked, but the masochist in me can't help it :/"
"All passengers who have stayed in South Korea or in the three provinces most affected by the virus in Italy - namely Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna - for the past 14 days will be banned from entering Mauritius. Italy is, to date, the most affected country after China.https://www.lexpress.mu/article/370888/covid…https://defimedia.info/coronavirus-les-passa…"
"I'm not sure about the price concern, what about those that have died / affected. Come on, have some perspective, humility and understanding"
Only just realized the context of that sentence about prices dropping but I for one didnt mean they would drop because of the virus and I dont think Frusci did either.It was just a general statement Toon3.
"Only just realized the context of that sentence about prices dropping but I for one didnt mean they would drop because of the virus and I dont think Frusci did either.It was just a general statement.Apologies more gremlins on TA this morning - this posted twice and no I'm not on a mobile!Edited: 5:48 am, February 25, 2020 "
"The 15 South Korean couples who arrived in Mauritius yesterday on the Alitalia flight were repatriated on Tuesday 25 February. When they arrived, they were quarantined at the Anse La Raie center, which angered those already there.Nothing was said about Koreans on the plane yesterday, just the Italians from the suspect areas.https:/…covid19-30-sud-coreens-rapatries"
"Worrying I've jumped too soon is something I generally do. But in this case I am actually factoring the effect of COVID-19 and the likelihood it will mean waiting would have been better financially. I have no moral qualms about that. As it doesn't make a jot of difference to those that are suffering. Nor does it preclude me from having compassion for those who's lives have been turned upside down by this. Not just those that have died, but also those that may miss weddings, birthdays, funerals, a last moment with a loved one and possibly even lose their jobs.I do however have moral qualms about sucking up lots of resources to travel half way around the world to enjoy a luxury holiday, when ~2 Billion people on the planet don't have secure food, water, shelter. I appreciate the wall to wall coverage may bring such moral concerns to the forefront of peoples minds. But let's be honest here, there's nothing virtuous or morally righteous about taking these holidays at any other time of the year. Where is the perspective, humility and understanding when we spend thousands flying over people that worry where the next drink/meal is coming from to get our winter sun?"
"Also I do have some moral qualms about screwing every last saving out of resorts that are suffering financially. Not for the large businesses, but more for their staff. Who I worry may lose their jobs and suffer financially.I'l be honest, it doesn't always stop me. I don't pay more if I can avoid it. I have found myself on the ground in a few places hit by unexpected events. From afar I chase the deal. But when I get there I tend to tip more generously/forgo haggling, seeing the staff and particularly small vendors are really suffering. If you're prepared to pay more from the outset, then you're a better man/woman then me :)"
"UK FCO latest advice re coronavirus:CoronavirusThere are currently no known cases of coronavirus in Mauritius. However, there are enhanced quarantine procedures at entry points to Mauritius such as airports and ports. Health authorities may carry out extended health checks on arrival. Any passenger showing symptoms of coronavirus may be placed in quarantine for up to 14 days. You should comply with any additional screening measures by the authorities if asked to go through extra checks.As a preventative measure against the spread of coronavirus, the Government of Mauritius announced on 24 February that any person who has travelled to South Korea or the Italian regions of Lombardy, Veneto and Emlia-Rogmana since 10 February will not be permitted to clear immigration and enter Mauritius."
"Related to this I just got an email from Voyage Prive saying they will allow anyone booked to travel to China, South Korea or the affected Italian regions to cancel. But they are only offering credit right now.Guess that will extend to any other countries/regions that are added to the FCO list."
Seychelles are testing two Spanish tourists for Corona. https://defimedia.info/coronavirus-deux-cas-…
The ministerial committee on COVID-19 decided that access to Mauritius would be prohibited to anyone who has stayed in Italy or Iran during the past 14 days. This is due to the growing number of cases recorded in these two countrieshttps://defimedia.info/coronavirus-toute-per…
"Yikes, I suspect quite a few people will have booked Alitalia and possibly added a few days in Italy. I know I was considering it when alternative routes worked out much more expensive."
"Health watch updateAs of yesterday, there were a total of 47 people under observation in Mauritius. They are all in good health. At Souillac hospital, 24 are in quarantine and six in isolation. In the center of Anse-la-Raie, 17 people are in quarantine. Since the start of the health watch, of the 176 people placed under observation, 129 have been authorized to return home. A cruise ship which wasnt allowed into Seychelles is docking in Mauritius today - that's 3 ships this week.https://www.lexpress.mu/article/371234/epide…"
"Hi Bronia Any idea why those ships were not allowed in Seychelles? Any suspected cases on the board ? How many hospitals is on the island, out of curiosity? Cheers"
"Only one ship was scheduled to call at Seychelles as far as we know. The journalist on board the ship (who's passengers are students) said that the port authority in Seychelles informed the captain that they would not be allowed to make port in their country. Instead, they would be making a fuel stop in Mauritius.It seems they had been at sea for 11 days and were refused entry to several planned ports.The Captain said the passengers are in good health. On the Semester at Sea Facebook page, the students on board said they are looking forward to visiting Mauritius and there are a couple of photos by the students on Facebook if you are interested.Off hand cant count the hospitals and clinics but quite a number!Edited: 6:29 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"With the current virus spread in Europe & US it`s only a matter of time when first case is reported in Mauritius as it`s a popular holiday destination, As long as medical services stay alert .... we can only stay calm and wait for vaccine I guess."
"Tomasz I think you are right.More on that ship from their own website which was turned away from Seychelles. The Seychelles Ministry of Health and the Seychelles Port Authority denied the MV World Odyssey entry to the Seychelles. Despite multiple appeals and no evidence of health concerns on the ship, the decision was upheld.https:/…The Sun Princess is docking tomorrow and Azamara Quest a much smaller ship the same day I think.The Costa Mediterranea left Mauritius for an Indian ocean cruise on the 28th Feb and returns to Mauritius on the 14th March.Mauritius is fairly new to the cruising market."
"The Sun Princess was refused access to the port in Mauritius. This, because 5 Italians had joined the boat without the period of 14 days of quarantine, according to the Ministry of Health.From Le Defi today:The arrival of the cruise ship AidaBlu at the port this Monday morning March 2 worries some residents of Cassis and Les Salines. They are afraid of the risks of contamination with the new coronavirus.Thus, at the request of certain inhabitants, the PMSD deputy, for constituency number 1 (Port-Louis Ouest / GRNO), Patrice Armance, went to the port this morning.In a statement to Radio Plus, Patrice Armance explains that the residents deplore a lack of communication from the authorities. When he visited the site, he noted that health officers had carried out tests on the passengers.The fear according to him ""comes from the ocean liner which has been turned back to the island of Reunion"".Yesterday, Sunday March 1, incidents occurred at Port Est on Reunion Island when the Sun Princess arrived.Residents who had gathered at the port tried to prevent the passengers from leaving the liner.It comes back to us that this morning the Sun Princess was refused access to the port in Mauritius. This, because 5 Italians had joined the boat without the period of 14 days of quarantine, according to the Ministry of Health.Also according to the Ministry of Health, the 2,177 passengers and 636 crew members of the ship AidaBlu have undergone screening tests and all are doing well.-------------------------------https://defimedia.info/coronavirus-larrivee-…"

"James - today's developments courtesy of Le Defi:The Ministry of Health has taken new decisions following the spread of Covid-19 in several regions and departments in France and in Germany.As a result, the following decisions were made on Wednesday afternoon, March 4:• Anyone leaving, or having transited through France during the past 14 days, will now be automatically placed in quarantine, only if this person has symptoms such as fever, cough or breathing difficulties.• Anyone leaving, or having transited through Germany during the past 14 days, will now be automatically placed in quarantine, only if this person has symptoms such as fever, cough or breathing difficulties.• These measures are temporary and will evolve according to the evolution of the situation resulting from the spread of COVID-19.• The Ministry of Health and Welfare specifies that to date, no case of COVID-19 has been recorded on Mauritian territory. 35 people are under observation at Souillac. 30 people are placed in quarantine and 5 people are in isolation.As for the Anse-la-Raie youth center, 6 people are in quarantine there against 17 in Pointe-Jérôme.The Ministry of Health said in its statement that 58 people are currently under observation in Mauritius. ---------------------------------------------https://defimedia.info/covid-19-ceux-ayant-t…"
"Same here - I am supposed to fly tomorrow from Germany. I don’t have major symptoms, have been having a runny nose for last dipole if days, but no fever or anything else. But who knows how strict these guys will be in their checks. And last thing I want is to quarantined"
Thank you for these updates Bronia.
"Hi guys, can someone who just flew into Mauritius the last couple of days, share some experience with the health screening and checks at arrival. Are people being quarantined?"
"Maybe it is a stupid question, but...Does transiting France refer as well as to changing planes at an airport, the transfer time being only a few (ex. 2) hours?"
"We're flying in a few weeks and I always get off a long haul flight with the sniffles/cough :/ Recirculated air, crammed in with lots of people and allergies is a bad combination.Have to hope they apply some common sense. Or they may well be holding a lot of people. As i'm sure i'm not the only one that gets off a long haul flight looking like that."
"This could`ve been expected. I got a strange feelings I`ll arrive to Mauritius and then spend a 2 lovely weeks in quarantine as I`m flying from London. Flights price are going down rapidly, anyone noticed?"
Tomas just checked my business class flight for June with Turkish airlines and as today it's exactly the same price I paid. Emirates is the same price too.Maybe flights in the next month or so are affected?
"Just checked our flights and price is still within the range I was seeing when I booked. Although I guess since its been a while since I booked, you could consider that to be a ""fall"" as I'd normally expect it to have gone up now we're only a few weeks out.Interestingly the Air Mauritius flight has dropped about ~£700, about the cheapest i've ever seen it. Possibly lucky the price put me off, as the outbound leg is via CDG. Although who knows where else will be on the watch list by the time we fly :/"
MK price reduction makes sense if via CDG.Communication Unit set up by the Ministry of Tourism. Unfortunately the video of the press conference doesnt work.https://defimedia.info/covid-19-une-cellule-…
"On 24th February, they banned people who transited Italy or South Korea over some few hundread cases.I think France and Germany will be next.Questions is when."
Anyone had a problems on arrival ?
"The Ministry of Health says there are no cases of coronavirus (Covid-19) in Mauritius. A press release was issued to that effect in the evening on March 6. However, 71 people are currently under quarantine in Mauritius."
"As a previous poster raised about being worried that they would arrive in Mauritius only to spend 2 weeks in quarantine... this is what I’m afraid of, especially with 3 young children, at least one of whom has sniffles/cough etc at any given time. We’re travelling via Dubai in 4 weeks.Edited: 2:13 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"https://defimedia.info/cas-suspect-de-corona…Screenshot of the video circulating on Facebook showing two nursing staff at Victoria Hospital, dressed in a yellow coverall, who were carrying a man, visibly suffering, and who wore a maskThe results of the coronavirus tests carried out on a suspect case, namely on a Rwandan patient who was admitted to the Victoria hospital, turned out to be negative, according to the Ministry of Health.The results fell around 9:30 p.m. this Friday, March 6.A wind of panic blew on the Web in the afternoon after the publication of a video made at the Victoria Hospital by a user on Facebook.The video, which has since been removed, shows two members of the nursing staff, dressed in a yellow coverall, walking along the corridor. They were carrying a man, visibly suffering, who was wearing a mask.The publication of this video had aroused strong reactions, even questions from Internet users.In a statement issued shortly after 7:30 p.m., the Ministry of Health clarified that there are no cases of Covid-19 (Coronavirus) in Mauritius."
There is no such problem in MRU ...I arrived on 5th March and I am enjoying my vacation happily. There is nothing here. Not even a single person is seen in masks. There’s nothing

Today weather was good ...it was a sunny day. Yesterday it was rainy all day.
"Got a text and email from Airline, that had me worried flight was being cancelled. Instead they've moved us to the earlier flight, which is a pain as it means pulling my daughter out of school and wife taking another day off :/Particularly annoying as I paid more for the later flight. But could be a lot worse of course."
"Yeah Air France moved our flight to the next day, because they cancelled flight to France. I was about to move it to May anyway, due to all this madness."
"Phoned Turkish Airlines and they've confirmed original flight is cancelled, so they've moved us to the earlier one.They said I could cancel for a refund (it's a 1h 40m change so wasn't sure) but will have to do that via booking agent. Will look at alternative options, but the only viable one right now is with Mauritius Airlines. The advantage is that's direct return, but outbound goes via Paris, so probably best sticking with Turkish right now.Guess on the plus side, it's given me the option to cancel the flight without cost, should a better option turn up.Edited: 2:07 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"Frusci what time was the flight they cancelled and why did they cancel it? We are flying business TK in June on the flight which gets into Mauritius about 12.45om (TK176)Or was it the one from London they cancelled?Turkey as yet has no cases - France increased by 177 today to 1,126.Italy is now in second place after China.For anyone interested here are the worldwide stats which are updated daily:https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Edited: 2:14 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"TK1972 @ 17:45 from LHR.They didn't say way. Just moved us to the 4pm flight.I presume lack of bookings, so they've moved everyone to the earlier flight.Edited: 2:17 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"I've seen the news about France. Can't miss it right now, wall to wall coverage in the UK.Given what happened with the Alitalia flight, probably not a good idea to switch."
"Hmm,The UK seems to be around 2 weeks behind Italy in Coronovirus symptoms. I guess I, like many are travelling out to Mauritius around Easter with family & kids.As they shut down travel from Northern Italy a few days ago I can't see any other situation other than travel from the Uk will be banned by the time Easter comes around.Unless the ecenomic outlook makes for a different case.What do you all think?"
Thanks Frusci. So the LHR-IST flight.We fly ex Manchester and there are two flights per day to Istanbul. LHR-IST has 3 - One at 07:05 one at 11.35 and one at 1615 so assume you are on the last one now.Ernest can you move your flight without penalty?I think Italy handled it badly from the very start and they have different circumstances to the UK.No one knows what's going to happen. We are in unchartered waters.
"That’s right, we’re on the 16:15 now. Originally there was a 17:45 which we’d booked. But they have dropped that one now."
"Due to coronavirus brakout, AirFrance allowed us to re-book flight without any extra charge up to 31th may. But I can't see this info right now. I am no sure what to do now. Either we cancel or re-book. But who knows what happens in may...Edited: 3:53 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"Ernst, who knows what will happen :/What about your hotel? Are they allowing you to move your dates?I guess if you can switch both hotel and flight and don't need to commit now, you could just wait and see."
"#70 I hope you are wrong (no offence!). We are within the group you mentioned, ie going for the 2 week Easter holidays. Keeping a keen eye on the situation but can only wait and see. Got everything crossed all is well to still go come Easter"
"Frusci, thing is im flying on thursday so not much time left:)"
"bronia wrote:>I think Italy handled it badly from the very start and they have different circumstances to the UK.I know this is not the appropriate place to discuss this, but as I am following this forum as I *hope* to trvael to Mauritius in August, I feel I have to reply to this. Italy did not handle it badly, we took everything seriously from the very start. This is exactly why we have so many certified cases right now - because we took many more tests than in any other European countries. The virus is taken very seriously here from day one, while the same cannot be said of other countries. It is bad enough to struggle agains tthis, without ngative infromation being spread without proof.Thank you.Edited: 6:28 am, March 09, 2020 "
"I am not going to argue here but it certainly didnt help that the original superspreader in Italy wasn't tested.-------------------------------------------As new cases were confirmed in Spain, France, Austria, Switzerland, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Norway and Algeria, it was reported that a hospital in Lombardy, where the bulk of the infections are located, delayed testing “patient-one”, a 38-year-old man who is believed to be the first source of local transmission.------------------https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/2…https:/…Google throws up plenty more media articles."
"Hate to say that but UK is not handling the spread either.... Only guide from Bo Jo is to keep washing your hands and etc, PPE is running short in hospitals and I can easily see 1000 cases by the end of this week if nothing is being done. Italy and China showed right approach by locking down most infected zones. If the time was right for it, probably it should`ve be done quicker. How long before we see London lock down ? What are your thoughts ?"
"Not my intention to argue either, but the first patient wasn't coming from China and it is still not clear where he got the virus from as his contacts were found clean. So back when he got sick, there was no known reason to test him.Since then Italy has tested 10 times more people than the other European reasons.It is important for travellers to know that the Italian health system has been taking this seriously since day one and is doing all thye can to handle the situation in the best possible way.Edited: 9:47 am, March 09, 2020 "
"Due to travel to Mauritius from the U.K. in May.Having travelled to northern Italy in February I am mindful of restrictions.Gov.uk says Mauritius won’t let me in if I’ve travelled to Italy since 14th May, which I have.On the other hand Mauritius Government site says admission will be refused only if it have visited Italy in the previous 14 days.Anyone know which is accurate?I accept it may be a moot point if CV goes widespread in the U.K. and Mauritius bans U.K. travellers anyway.Trying to avoid cancelling....."
"I thought the condition was no travel to Italy within 14 days of arrival in Mauritius. The reason being COVID-19 is believed to have an incubation period of upto 14 during which a patient may be asymptomatic.I'd contact the embassy/airline for further clarification. Things are constantly evolving unfortunately, so advice could have changed. And may well change again before you travel."
"The number of people placed in quarantine in Mauritius this Monday, March 9 due to the coronavirus epidemic stands at 103 people according to a press release issued by the Ministry of Health, Monday, March 9.At the New Souillac Hospital, 37 people are confined while 5 others are in isolation.At the Anse-La-Raie youth center, 31 people are in quarantine.In Pointe-Jérôme, 35 people are confined.

Hi so how was ur experience at the mauritius airport? Was it seamless or you had some trouble. We are planning a trip next week and wondering if every thing would be ok.
"Arrived in Mauritius on Monday 9th March. You fill out yellow health card, you have your temperature taken and this is written on the card. After immigration you go to the health check, they ask what countries you have been to in the last 6 months, China, Italy, etc and then your on your way. The hotel we are staying at are taking all guests temperature in the morning."
"You also have to state which countries you have visited in the past 6 months on the yellow health card.Thanks for the update RiAins.Which hotel are you staying at?Jonaton know how you must be feeling. I just lost my hotel and flight booking money for Athens next week as cancelled on medical advice.Also we fly TK to Mauritius in June and as yet seen no chance to change or cancel flights.Edited: 12:23 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"Thanks for that, useful!Whats the weather like, is it humid?Have a great holiday."
It's very very humid
RiAins - would be helpful if we could post weather updates on the current weather thread and virus updates here please? Thanks.
With the W H O now saying it is a Pandemic I am looking to Virgin to refund me the full amount for my holiday.
"Dave, are you actually entitled for refund if there is no cases in Mauritius as yet ?"

"""Only when the FCO advises against travelling to a country or region is cancellation cover likely to be in place.""Generally true, insurers rarely cover disinclination to travel. Would leave them wide open in normal circumstances. But it's always worth calling your insurer and discussing it with them. At the very least a cold hard actuarial calculation may make them change their mind. For example if you're in a high risk group, they may decide better to pay out for a cancelation then risk you catching it abroad and dying.Worth speaking to your GP first as letter from your GP advising against travel may help."
"Update on quarantine in Express - a video of Anse Le Raie . Not sure who they put in these.Deplorable. This is how this man, who landed in Mauritius with his wife and daughter on Wednesday, March 11, describes the state of the Anse-la-Raie quarantine center.The couple and their 5-year-old daughter arrived from Italy via Paris. As required by the procedure, the three were transferred to a center for quarantine. But the man claims that the ambulance that transported them was dirty. When he got to the center, he was shocked to find that there were dust-covered rat traps under his bed.------------------------Video in article plus photos.https://www.lexpress.mu/video/372208/centres…"
"Bronia that is pretty dire. But why travel from Italy when you know you are going to be refused entry?Taken from Gov website “As a preventative measure against the spread of coronavirus, the Government of Mauritius has announced that any person who has travelled to China since 19 January, or South Korea since 10 February, or Iran or Italy since 14 February, will not be permitted to clear immigration and enter Mauritius.”"

"If you are unsure if announcement is still in charge you can check here health.govmu.org/English/Pages/default.aspx it's official site of Mauritius health ministry, the last info is from 4th March, so nothing has changed since then."
"Exactly Ernest, nothing has changed since then.Did you manage to sort your flights out?"

Dubai is not restricted for now, however coming out of the plane with high temperature and sneezing wouldn't be good idea :)"
That website you give does not answer the question re Norovirus and it is not possible to even try to find anything on it for English speakers.

Bronia sorry this website gives No answer in plain English to a very simple question that is so Important and could mean the death of somebody.Is there Norovirus in Mauritius? Has anybody been positively identified with Norovirus in Mauritius. we are travelling with children and manyh also withe elderly or retirees.

"Hi peoples. I will try and give you an insight into what I see and come across in my travel to Mauritius. Sat right now in at Gatwick airport,due to take off in about two hours time,the mood here is jovial and only a handful of masks to be seen. Many many people traveling all over the world, no cancellations showing on the departure board. No extra measures being taken by staff or security. Will update once landed in Mauritius to weather and airport conditions and anything else that I think is relevant. Regards."
"Thanks for the update seasonedtraveller011, I fly tomorrow so look forward to seeing how you get on on arrival. Judging from the seat map my flight from Paris to Mauritus looks very empty..."
"""we are travelling with children and manyh also withe elderly or retirees."" I don't think that taking elderly people is wise since they are the most vulnerable group. seasonedtraveller011 it would be great if you tell us what happens there. :)"
"Yvonne I didnt give you a website? Ernest did.

All very up in the air."
I suspect Yvonne meant to write Coronavirus. Would be a bit strange to be worried about norovirus.Not that it changes much.
"Unfortunately the virus spreads very quickly, as we saw here in Italy, and is already spreading around Europe and in the UK. I hate to say this I believe that resticitions on travellers will become stricter for everyone soon. It is a big risk for Mauritius to accept any tourist right now, although I realize that stopping tourism for them would mean stopping most of the country :(.

"Lovell that has not changed. They've been asking that since I can remember, nothing new there. Its always been asked on the yellow health card."
"Ah good to know, thank you."
"Yes, it has always been asked. I think it helps with a diagnosis if a person arrives from outside of Mauritius with Malaria, as that can show up up to 6 months after being bitten. I know there were also questions at one stage about people having been in countries where Ebola virus had had an outbreak. These questions do not have anything to do with Covid-19 ."

"May just be an issue with their servers. Or they could be updating policy info, for example to provide information on COVID-19. My insurer added a COVID-19 specific FAQ to their website recently.Bit late now, but from my days of being on the road several months a year I have a routine which I go through as part of renewing our insurance:1) Download docs and save to phone.2) Email to myself, my wife and my parents (our emergency contact). Just need to search for Travel Insurance and up it pops.3) Update the ""Travel Insurance"" contact saved in our phones with any new numbers and links.4) Print out the contact sheet and store it with our passports.May sound like a lot of hassle, but it takes all of 10 mins. I always go for a reputable provider and comprehensive policy as we do some far flung holidays. So I'm not worried about the insurer pulling a fast one. But more that if something goes wrong, I don't want to be frantically finding the required info. It's available in multiple places."

Even if you want to travel I suspect it will affect your travel insurance.Good chance it will also end our holiday plans. My Dad just fits into that age group. Whilst we have a lot of close family nearby and the government is planning to make arrangements to support them during isolation, I'm not sure i'd be comfortable leaving them for 2 weeks whilst in isolation. Just in case they need something, I'd worry they'd be more likely to head to the shops if I wasn't here to drop it off (at the door)."
"Frusci not just over 70s it also mentions anyone with existing medical conditions which in the past they said diabetes, asthma, heart and lung disease, hypertension etc and not over 70.I was diagnosed last week with COPD though way under 70.The way the government leaked this last night via twitter and the Spectator must have caused a lot of angst.Plus they are being very unclear as to when the 4 months begins and how they will enforce it.It looks like I will have to cancel the next 4 holidays."

Still have our fingers crossed we make the trip :) 10 days and counting.
Following thread. I’m booked to go here for my Babymoon and not sure if it’s safe to go there still?
To be honest Viola nowhere can be classed as ‘safe’ as the situation is evolving all the time. Whether or not you are worried about getting the virus you need to consider potential disruption to travel plans and the implications for you.

The people in quarantine have they tested positive or is it just a preventative measure.

Can’t see anything on foreign office website. Until that changes we won’t get anything back on insurance. Hopefully today we will have another update? If not today I think it’s only a matter of time until things start getting cancelled.
"I`ve just cancelled my booking with AirBNB, full refund. Now got to either cancel my flights with Air Mauritius or postpone it to later date. I think there is quite a big panic on the island and travellers from Europe are not welcomed at the moment ."
"Well I've had an interesting morning :/Woke up to a text from a Mauritian friend with a link to the announcement.Coincidentally I had an appointment with the Travel Nurse for that very holiday. Was too late to cancel, so had to go anyway (plus advice could always change).Planted my bum in the GP waiting room and got a text from my wife. The consultant she'd been sharing a room with all last week has come down with symptoms and been sent for testing. Told the GP receptionist who consulted the Dr and instigated leper protocol (understandable).Walked to school and spoke to my daughters teacher at the door. She said the COVID-19 protocol didn't apply yet since even my wife's colleague hadn't been diagnosed yet. But then the headteacher walked past. And through an abundance of caution she asked me to go home and call 111. I understand her position, she'd probably be lynched by other parents if we have contracted it. But the school year will probably be over by the time 111 answer :)Fortunately my boss is a nice man (I work for myself) or the NHS would be losing two employees today."

We are currently in Mauritius and have been for the last 7 days. Due to fly back to Gatwick on Monday 23rd. As when I hear anything I will update everyone.
When this has happened in other countries they have still allowed repatriation flights. Your return dates may change though.Wish you all the best of luck with your return.

For those who have been there before, conditions will apply.Pravind Jugnauth made this statement to the press on Monday, March 16, after the meeting of the multisectoral committee on the Covid-19 . Mauritians or residents who come from or have passed through these countries will automatically be placed in quarantine. This measure is valid for the next two weeks and will be reassessed.“We have come to a situation where the World Health Organization has said that Europe has become the epicenter of Covid-19. In view of these latest developments in countries such as Spain, France, Germany, England, Switzerland, Norway, we have decided that from 8 p.m. GMT Wednesday March 18 we will extend the restrictions applied previously to countries such as China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Iran, Italy, to all passengers coming from or transiting through European countries, including England and Switzerland, for next two weeks. We will continue to follow. We also restrict access to all passengers arriving or transiting through Reunion for the next two weeks.

Thank you Bronia.We will sit tight for now.
Thanks Bronia. A little far in advance yet perhaps to ask this but I wonder what the situation is if your flights currently due to depart after the 2 weeks restriction (ie we are due to depart Saturday 4th April via Dubai). I wonder if they will say anyone transiting through or departing from Europe inc UK in last 14 days will be quarantined on arrival. How can insurers and holiday companies still say under these circumstances they will not refund (assuming FCO advice is that travel still not advised against).
Thanks Bronia. Fortunately it looks like a false alarm. Guess we'll be having lots of those given her clinic handles several hundred people a day :(
"So travel ban on UK/EU citizens is in place until 1st April, am guessing they are trying not to affect Easter holiday trade. Our flight is meant to be 3rd April so we will sit tight. I don’t want to be allowed in only to be stuck in quarantine but need Virgin to allow us to delay/refund or does travel insurance cover us if Mauritius won’t let us in? Does anyone know the answer to this?"
"Good news Frusci for your wife.Nothing anyone can do now except sit tight and wait.I really am so sorry for everyone there at the moment, but am sure the UK and other European countries will repatriate everyone.Ikh - I too am tempted to wait and see (we go July) but cant see things getting better TBH.The BBC has news that most of the airlines are going to ground flights and BA is cutting capacity by at least 75%.Holiday company Tui has also said it will suspend the ""majority"" of its operations, affecting ""package travel, cruises and hotel"" bookings.Advice from the BBCs consumer affairs man is this:Mass cancellations of flights in an unprecedented situation may leave passengers unsure of their rights.For those yet to fly out, it is relatively straightforward - you should be given a refund or, in some cases, the option to rebook for another date.If this is part of a package holiday, then the entire cost of the holiday will be refunded. A separate hotel booking will require a call to the hotel, asking for leeway, or perhaps a travel insurance claim if the policy covers you.For those trying to get home, an airline has a duty of care to get you back if they have cancelled your flight. This may mean flying with another airline or putting you on a different mode of transport. If an extra overnight stay is required, the airline should pay for that as well as the food you need. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51904769"
Anyone booking through virgin got any advice to get through to them? Their phone lines are down (unsurprisingly).

Hope they haven't gone under :/ I suspect they haven't set their IVR up properly and its playing the ""we're closed"" announcement instead of ""no agents available""The FCO page hasn't updated, so no point calling my insurer until it does.Will update what happens for the benefit of others insured with Barclays or booked through Voyage Prive'."
"Jibbi we are due to fly the day after you. Please can you update on here if you hear anything from Virgin? Bronia we have no option but to wait for the time being for an update to cover our dates of travel. We can’t cancel, or can but will lose £9k! So somehow by 1st April we should know, I just hope they announce before then not last minute what is happening with flights immediately following 1st April when the current travel ban ends."
Unless you're booked to go within the period of the ban I think your only option is to wait and see. In fact most insurers wont entertain any claim within 31 days of travel anyway.The only other option you have right now is to try and change dates. But little point sitting in a call queue all day as I suspect agents/hotel will prioritise those affected and tell you to call later.
"Why on earth are people still playing to go? I'm due to go 1st April, 10K package. We've cancelled. For one, if I get it I don't want to spread it to a plane full of people. If I or my wife or child don't have it I don't want them to get it from a selfish person on a plane. I also don't want to give it to hotel workers, their families and friends.Let's just be sensible and try to look after other humans, not our wants."
"Yes, we have to wait until April for those of us going after then to see what if anything changes by then.This seems to be true of a lot of countries who have bans - Cyprus is another one for instance.Some airlines are allowing date changes without penalty but for package holidays best to wait and see."
"Posted on another thread.If you have booked a package holiday for the next two weeks, then contact your tour operator for refunds.https://www.lexpress.mu/article/372520/covid…"
"Happiness813718 a little less of the finger pointing please.Unless you're planning to lock yourself in your house for months you're just transferring the risk elsewhere. As schools, work, public transport, parks, etc, etc also pose a risk of transmission.If people are travelling against FCO advice or trying to circumvent a countries ban, then of course that is questionable. But if a country's modelling/politicians choose to allow travellers then it's perfectly reasonable to defer to their expert analysis of the risk.And you should also remember this is not a zero sum equation. Pulling the economic plug will have relatively little impact on those of us who have the benefit of savings and social security. For those in working in the tourism industry in many of these countries they have no such security. No tourism equals risk of losing their jobs which ultimately means they can't keep a roof over their heads and put food and water on the table."
"https:/…coronavirus-outbreakIf you booked through an ABTA agent it looks like they are covering you. Either postponement, change of destination or refund."
"For this travelling to Mauritius, we are meant to be travelling Thursday. After much stress I have come across a travel update on a travel website which am unsure how true this is but it seems Mauritius is restricting anyone that is from or been to the uk for the next 14 days... can anyone shed any light on this? https://www.ttgmedia.com/news/mauritius-outl…"
Alexigarcia yes its true - see previous posts on this thread:https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g293…
So I’m supposed to be travelling from Glasgow on the 1st April at 9.30pm - exactly 90 mins after the 14 day exclusion.....haha....what a mess!! Really need the FCO to update info.
We were supposed to go to Mauritius from London on Saturday 21st for a special anniversary but obviously the plan has been cancelled. We booked our flight and hotel via British Airways and received an email from them stating that a full refund would be given in the next 7 days.
"Hmmmm, just spotted Voyage Prive are ABTA registered. Went back to double check the ABTA COVID-19 FAQ and it looks like its changed.It did say ABTA agents would offer an alternative, postponement or refund. Now says it's based on each individual agents terms.I have my Travel Insurance as a backup anyway. But not so good for those that aren't covered."
"Flying from Gatwick on the 22nd of March, assuming this is no longer happening... package holiday with Tui but no comms from them yet regarding the below articles. Ryan"
The UK FOC website says its been updated but it still does not state UK and EU citizens will not be admitted - Frustratinghttps:/…health
"Same here, we are on same flights, awaiting info from TUI and FOC"

"Strange, looks like they just updated with Cyclone warning:Still current at: 16 March 2020 Updated: 16 March 2020 Latest update: Update on cyclone warning in place in Mauritius (“Natural Disasters” page)."
"Home>News>Covid-19 : Mauritius extends travel restrictions to European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland and Reunion Island for next two weeks  News Print Send To Friend Add To Average Rating      Covid-19 : Mauritius extends travel restrictions to European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland and Reunion Island for next two weeksDate: March 16, 2020 Domain:Health; Tourism Persona: Business; Citizen; Government; Non-Citizen  GIS - 16 March, 2020: As from 20 00 GMT, Wednesday 18 March 2020, Mauritius is extending travel restrictions for a period of two weeks on foreign passengers coming from or having transited during the last 14 days in countries of the European Union, including United Kingdom and Switzerland. Also, as from today 20 00 GMT, all foreign passengers coming or transiting from Reunion Island will not be allowed to enter Mauritius for the next two weeks. As for Mauritians coming from these countries, they will be automatically placed in quarantine for a period of two weeks. These preventive measures have been announced, this morning, at a press conference by the Prime Minister, Mr Pravind Kumar Jugnauth, in Port Louis, following a high-level committee on Covid-19. As a date there is no case of Covid-19 in Mauritius. According to the World Health Organisation, said the Prime Minister, Europe is the new epicenter of the coronavirus adding that there are currently 157 countries around the world affected by the pandemic. This situation is having consequential impacts on various sectors of the Mauritian economy, especially the tourism industry, he added.Amid this outbreak, he reiterated Government’s efforts to prevent the virus from reaching Mauritius while highlighting that meetings are being held on a daily basis at the level of different ministries to monitor closely the situation. However, he said, Mauritius, figuring among countries not yet affected by Covid-19, remains extremely vulnerable and at risk. The Prime Minister also underlined that arrangements will be made for passengers who have opted for the special Air Mauritius flight package with itinerary from Reunion Island to Mauritius and eventually to France. Referring to the cruise ship from Fremantle Australia expected to dock the Mauritian port, he indicated that Government is applying all sanitary measures and will ensure that the ship is on sea for a period of more than 14 days before reaching Mauritius. Prime Minister Jugnauth appealed to the population to seek information only from trusted sources and not to give in to fake news regarding Covid-19. He advised them to adopt good hygienic habits such as washing hands regularly with soap, to refrain from shaking hands and to avoid crowded places. Speaking on sanitary measures, he indicated that an additional budget has been allocated to the Ministry of Health and Wellness to acquire necessary equipment if ever there is any case of Covid-19. He added that the population is to rest assured that there is no shortage of supply of basic commodities such as rice, oil, flour, milk and petrol on the market. It is to be noted that Mauritius has already taken a number of policy decisions to restrict travel from a number of high risk countries such as Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Italy and Iran."
Strange how the FCO can update the Cyclone warning and not this update from hours ago.
"With a heavy heart, we have made the decision to reschedule our trip through our travel agent to October (for now). We were due to fly out today but the uncertainty of the closing of the border on Wednesday, the fact the FCO haven't updated their site to reflect this and the risk of being quarantined on arrival was just too much. Wishing everyone safe travels who is leaving tonight and tomorrow."
You can also look on this website for https:/…mauritius-travel-alerts
"I agree, very frustrating and unfair to not prioritise when this decision appears clear cut now."
"Still trying to find out any info from TUI, regarding our return flight next Monday. Our hotel have asked us to find out when we will be returning to the UK."
"Mine has now been cancelled, this was the only time I could arrange it for so looks like no Mauritius for me.I will stick with the Caribbean for my hols from now on."
"Totally agree Happiness #207While I have every sympathy for those in the travel industry I think that it is irresponsible to embark on holiday travel at this stage as this virus is evolving rapidly. These island communities do not need extra risk and should anyone getseriously ill, their health services would bestretched behind their capability. Yes tourism will take a big hit but it will recover. People won’t. I hope people are treated well by their agents and report back so that the good guys are known to the TA community. I hope too that the visitors out there receive help from airlines etc. Communication is often an issue when things go wrong. Stay safe all.Edited: 2:11 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"We are due to fly home to Gatwick on Monday 23rd March on TUI but haven't heard anything yetEdited: 2:13 pm, March 16, 2020 "
Don’t give up on that beautiful island ... I go two or three times a year and my next trip is/was September and I pray I get back. It’s home for me and because it’s so small they need to be extra cautious. As soon as I can I’m off again just please don’t dismiss visiting!!!
Auds I’m sure people will come back when it’s right :) Mauritius is not alone that’s for sure
Anyone else had a text message from TUI cancelling their holiday to Mauritius from the 17th to the 27th of march. received text at 8.15 pm
"I just wish ours was cancelled, which is something I wouldn’t have expected to say even a few weeks ago. My worry has gone from “I hope we can still go on holiday” to “I hope we will get our money back!” Is anyone able to confirm if they’ve been offered a refund and if so, what was their date of travel and was this through insurance or holiday company? We have a package booked through Destination 2 and along with our insurers the stance is that unless if FCO advise against travel we will lose all of our money if we decide not to go. In the current situation where UK nationals not allowed for next 2 weeks from Wed (currently), their flights are presumably cancelled and therefore I would expect given a refund - is anyone able to confirm this. I suppose even if I know that to be the case I have to hope it’s extended to 4th - our departure date. I’m surprised though that I haven’t seen any announcements from Emirates re refunds for flights to Mauritius given this mornings announcement. The Emirates Covid19 page hasn’t been updated since 8:30am UAE time ie before the announcement."
"As of Monday, March 16, 204 people are in quarantine and four have been placed in segregation.Faced with the growing number of countries on the watch list and returning travelers, a new quarantine center was opened in Pointe-aux-Piments and 19 passengers who returned to Mauritius were placed there today. 51 others are in Belle-Mare and 25 in Quatre-Soeurs. The Pointe-Jérôme center accommodates 32 people, including two foreigners. In Souillac, four people are in solitary confinement and 32 in quarantine. The Ministry of Health reiterates that to date, no case has been reported in Mauritius. https://www.lexpress.mu/article/372541/covid…"
Anyone else is trying to look for other holiday destination this or next week ? Cape Verde still accepts UK tourists.
We are in the same situation. For some reason the FCO has not updated the Mauritius page (apparently an update on a cyclone warning was more pressing than COvid-19!!). Sour Africa has the same travel ban from weds but their page is up to date. Absolutely no contact from Emirates either. We are meant to fly on Friday so just playing the waiting game...
You can also look on this website for https:/…mauritius-travel-alertsThis link is update with info for the restrictions etc.
Don’t understand why Emirates haven’t changed their Covid-19 page either. Last update was 08:40am yesterday Dubai time - before Mauritius issued their update.
Edit to my last post: so emirates have updated the list of affected flights this morning but no mention of Mauritius?!
"So I drove down to Gatwick yesterday but didn't end up boarding the flight. BA staff had no clue whether we could get home or not, and with a child in the party I just thought it too risky. We are all well btw. I wouldn't get on the plane poorly.Hotel have been great and issued us with a credit. Gatwick parking refunded me. Just waiting on a BA voucher now for the flights - not sure if this will be forthcoming or not as it was so close to take off, but hopefully. If not, then insurance or Amex claim.Good luck to everyone else. Apparently my flight was fully checked in, but how many people no-showed I don't know. Some must have (like us)."
FCO still not updated :/
Here's the announcement on the Mauritius Government page in case it helps anyone with their Travel Agent/Insurer.govmu.org/English/News/Pages/Covid-19-Maurit…Hopefully FCO will update their page soon.
Nothing on Turkish Airlines page yet either:https:/…
"If I login to manage my booking on Turkish Airlines website I get the option to cancel. But I believe this is because of the schedule change they made last week.Others may want to check their own flights, to see if they've also added cancelation option for MRU flights in general."
I have emailed the FCO to get them to update it. It might be worth a few of us doing this- link below to the email form. I have no idea why they aren’t updating the page it’s going to be dosruptive for so many people https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/…
"Frusci just logged into my TK flight for June has the option to cancel or change.Is it on the top line of your booking which gives you the option to add flight, change flight, addinfant passenger, cancel flight? I cant recall seeing this before?I think I will give TK a ring later today.We were talking last night about me having to self isolate for 3 months and it wouldnt end until the first week after we are supposed to fly.Checking prices they seem the same for the rest of the year, including November, so might ask them.A nightmare for everybody!Those of you still in Mauritius, have you heard about flights home yet?I wish you all luck!"
"Yep, its right at the top under the frame which has the Booking reference.Mine says:""There was an unexpected change in your flight. You can contact our call center or sales offices to make transactions.""Then ""cancel"" & ""change flight"" buttons.This appeared last week after they changed my outbound flight.Once I click the cancel button there's a popup that says:""Since your ticket is bought from agency, you can get your refund through the agency where you bought your ticket. If you use this page for refund process, you will be able to get your refund by contacting THY Sales Offices after completing the transaction. You can find detailed information about Sales Office locations at here. Do you want to continue to refund process?""So it looks like if I can't get through to my booking agent I can initiate the cancelation process via THY instead.I haven't been able to get through to Voyage Prive (VP), so have had to email them. I figure i'll give them a chance to respond before cancelling the flight. If they wont refund I'll need to contact my travel insurance and check what they want me to do. I know i'm covered as they released a useful FAQ covering this eventuality. But I don't want to give them any wiggle room, by possibly doing things in the wrong order :)For other destinations, that have been put on the FCO do not travel list, VP have offered credit. But that doesn't work for us. As it's very unlikely my wife will be allowed any leave for some time now. Once this blows over they will have a massive backlog of patients. So its either a refund from VP or claim with insurance."
"I've emailed them too.Not sure why it hasn't been updated yet. Unless its actually not the official stance yet?We're meant to be flying out on Monday, booked through Voyage Perive."
I have emailed them as well. I will let you know when I receive a reply.
"Thanks Frusci, was reluctant to click on those buttons!I hope you manage to get sorted!Sophie and Rarely A hope you get sorted too!Edited: 7:03 am, March 17, 2020 "
Apparently the Mauritian PM led the press conference I can’t imagine it being more official than that and the update is on IATA website. I’ve instagrammed Emirates too! https:/…
"NP.Less worried about the holiday/money, more worried about people taking leave of their senses now :(If anyone was wondering why the government was taking the softly softly approach take a look in your local town centre/hospital. People have lost their minds.I live in London, walking distance to a major shopping centre. It was relatively calm a few days ago. As soon as the tougher messaging started everything has taken a nosedive.One supermarket closed. People shouting and screaming in another because they don't want to wait. Shelves cleared. My wife's department has had patients turning up in masks and shouting they want to be pushed to the front of the queue. The perverse irony of shouting at clinicians who will spend all day in that clinic throughout this crisis clearly hasn't dawned on them.Worse still In my wife's department they had 24 bottles of hand gel. They now have 3 bottles left. That isn't patients taking them, they were in stock rooms, but trained staff that have lost their minds :(Unfortunately a significant portion of the population don't behave rationally. So you don't want to light the fuse until you have to :("
CBG100The announcement of the ban is on the government page:govmu.org/English/News/Pages/Covid-19-Maurit…Hopefully your agent/insurer will accept that in the absence of FCO updating their page.Good luck.
"Good that IATA is up to date. I’ve contacted emirates though and they said the flights aren’t affected I guess because it is via Dubai and the second leg ie DXB to MAU will have many nationalities on not just UK or those from the BHX - DXB leg. Our agent now said we can postpone to a particular date this year, but if we choose to do this and the ban is extended to 4th April we cannot then cancel/get a refund. The alternative is to wait until an announcement that covers 4th April but by this time there may have been a surge in prices (which we would obviously have to pay the difference)"
"Frusci unfortunately my agent said they wouldn’t consider issuing a refund on the basis of any source other than the FCO! But I’m in the limbo period anyway as my date is 4th April. Interesting though the IATA website doesn’t mention anything about the ban being in place for 14 days (to 1st April)Edited: 8:02 am, March 17, 2020 "
lkh08Hopefully the FCO pull their finger out. Although I appreciate they are probably having a hard time keeping up right now.

Just sitting on hold with insurer. Saves the argument about FCO advice :)
I received a reply to my email to the FCO and it's a copy and paste of what's on their website! No use whatsoever.I will speak to British Airways and check if I can get a full refund.
"FCO might update travel guidance from tomorrow, when Mauritius airport will be shut. My travel agent is also being funny when it comes to refund my flights. Insurance claim would be the last resort to get my money back."
"So a further update from a conversation I just had with my insurer (Barclays):I booked by Voyage Prive, but their helpline is going straight to voicemail (office closed). Under the booking on the website it's giving me the option to cancel for a credit.I've now Spoken to my insurer and they've advised I am covered. But only if I do not cancel and accept a credit. Their advice is if Voyage Prive won't refund me, to get written confirmation I have forfeited my booking. Then file a claim.Anyone else in the same position should speak to their insurer and consider carefully if they want to accept a credit.In my case accepting credit is not a viable option as my Wife works in a busy hospital so is unlikely to be allowed leave for some time now :("
"FCO might update travel guidance from tomorrow, when Mauritius airport will be shut.--------------Tomas - Plaisance isn't closing?Just that Europeans arent allowed into Mauritius from Wednesday:----------------All visitors with travel history to the European Union, UK, Ireland, Norway and Switzerland, within the last 14 days, will not be allowed entry to or transit through the Republic of Mauritius as from Wednesday 18 March 2020, 20H00 GMT (00H00 local time), for a period of 14 days."

Thank you for that link Ash. We were meant to be staying at Riu Le Morne in April for a windsurfing holiday.
Happy to help but there’s more bad news I’m afraid
"Faced with the drastic drop in tourist arrivals, several hotels are forced to close. Arrangements have already been made to relocate clients.The Attitude group said that only two hotels, Zilwa Attitude and Lagoon Attitude, will be operational. From Wednesday March 18, customers of other hotels in the group will be relocated to these two establishments.As for the Beachcomber group, he said that Dinarobin customers will be transferred to the Paradis Beachcomber hotel.The two Riu Resorts hotels, Riu Creole and Riu Le Morne, will be closed from March 24 to May 31."
"The Prime Minister confirmed this Wednesday, March 18. Three people tested positive for Covid-19. They were immediately transported to Souillac hospital.One of the people, a 59-year-old man returning from England, was not in quarantine. He went to Victoria Hospital in Candos today and following the tests which turned out to be positive, he was placed in segregation. The ministry will now carry out ""contact tracing"" to find out who the man was in contact with. The other two patients, aged 21 and 25, were working on cruise ships and were in quarantine.In addition, the decision to completely close the Mauritian borders was taken by the inter-ministerial committee. As of tomorrow, Thursday March 19 at 10 a.m., no more commercial aircraft can land. As a result, Mauritians and tourists are banned from Mauritian territory for 14 days. https://www.lexpress.mu/article/372753/covid…"

A bit of the subject: Note to all holiday makers : DO NOT USE ""insure with ease"" for your travel insurance. Following few trials to contact my travel agent and Air Mauritius with no effect I made a call to my insurance company only to find out that I`m not covered for flight cancellation by air company... written on page x in small print.... thought I lose my head. When I was buying the policy I was reassured by the agent on few occasions that all cancellations will be covered.... Hopefully Air Mauritius won`t go burst and they will sort us out."
"Tomas hope you manage to sort something out with the airline.You managed to get a refund from Airbnb I think you said earlier?Turkish is letting people change dates and when I first compared prices for November/December they rather surprisingly weren't that much different from the price I paid for June.However, looking at dates this morning the flights were much dearer - they were offering semi-flex prices outbound which were reasonable but then only had the much dearer flex tickets inbound which hiked the cost considerably.I am going to sit on this for a little longer!"
Has anyone heard from Emirates? We were due to fly this Friday (tomorrow!) and not a peep from them! We haven’t even had a generic covid19 email which it seems every other airline we’ve ever had contact with have sent! I’ve even tried tweeting them.
Flight radar still shows quite a few flights incoming which don't look like cargo planes and Mauritius airports website shows that flights have landed today. Who knows? Maybe a short extension

"Yep. Got in the queue once, then cut off after 45 mins :/Oh well, not the end of the world I guess :) Worst case my insurance will suffer :/"
"Frusci Id recommend to contact your insurance provider to double check if you`re covered. Those sneaky bastards could put some small print on your policy as they`re securing themselves for similar instances. AirBNB is decent company, got a full refund for my booking. Many airlines face closing down in weeks to come, I`m guessing thats the main reason I didn`t hear nothing back from AIr Mauritius. They don`t offer any flight change as the may go burst if few weeks time. Turkish Airlines seems bigger organisation altogether therefore you got better chances to get a refund or reschedule your flights.Anyone else got issues with Air Mauritius ?Edited: 7:41 am, March 19, 2020 "
"Air Mauritius has stumbled from crisis to crisis over the past few years and this may well finally push it over.Todays press release from MK:NEWS RELEASE - 19 March 2020The following additional travel restrictions have been issued by the authorities in Mauritius due to the Covid-19 outbreak: “No passengers will be allowed entry or transit in the Republic of Mauritius Crew members will be allowed entry in the Republic of Mauritius, however, they shall be confined to their hotel rooms”The above directives do not apply for passengers travelling on the Mauritius – Rodrigues route.Air Mauritius wishes to inform the public that no passenger will be uplifted on its flights to Mauritius. Flight schedules are currently being amended accordingly and the passengers travelling out of Mauritius will be informed of revised schedules in due course.https:/…covid-19-outbreak---updates"
"TomasThanks, I have already spoken to them. They also put out a plain english FAQ covering most scenarios.They've confirmed i'm covered and there's no hurry to put in a claim. And they also understand I may not be able to get through to the Airline/Agent. Although I've now submitted Mytrips new online form and got confirmation. And also sent emails to Voyage Prive.The only caveat was if I accepted Voyage Prive's offer of credit they obviously wouldnt pay out on top. They advised refusing the credit and asking for confirmation from Voyage Prive I'd forfeited my money and then they would pay out.Morally I don't want to pull my money out. It's disposable income, so ideally I went to let Turkish Airlines and Voyage Prive hold on to it if they can reschedule for next Easter. I think they need it more then me right now. But I can't do that if I can't speak to them.And of course before I confirm reschedule I'll double check with my insurer i'm still covered should I be forced to cancel. But it doesn't look like it will get to that now :/ Likely going to be flight cancelation with refund from MyTrip/Turkish Airlines and either refund from Voyage Prive or forfeit booking and claim with insurance."
UK FCO have updated Mauritius advice:https:/…health
"Not due to fly to Mauritius until 24 April, however we are resigned to not going. We were flying with Emirates, just had a browse of their travel updates and it appears the option of a refund is no longer on the table, just a re-book or a travel voucher with a validity of 12 months. Pretty sure when I looked last week a refund was on offer. May be of interest to some.https:/…3515"

"Some holiday companies, Hotels and airlines are really taking the p*ss by deferring AND expecting you to pay more.They should either give you a refund or offer you the same dates next year at the same price.They seem to want to keep peoples money, apply advance booking rates (because they have you over a barrel) and ask governments for a bailout (which is ultimately our money anyway). Next they'll be asking us to get on the wing and flap so they can save fuel :/Edited: 6:35 am, March 20, 2020 "
Some news about the 7 infected people. They’re all in stable condition in Souillac hospital.
I’m in the same situation with Emirates Holidays. FINALLY have some contAct but No refunds. No vouchers. We won’t be using them again
Still havent got in touch with Turkish Airlines Frusci.How long do you have to wait before they bother answering on that number we mentioned the other day?
"broniaI never got through. Most of the time I get busy tone. When I do get through it eventually cuts me off :( Waited almost an hour on hold at one point.In the meantime I'm getting daily emails/texts from them asking me to contact them because my flight schedule has change lol. Firstly for the outbound flight that changed ~10 days ago. Now i'm getting alerts for the inbound flight that's also changed by a couple of days.What can you do but laugh :( The call centre is forgivable, but the joke that is their online booking management system is not forgivable for a national carrier. Even before this kicked in it was a PITA to use and throwing errors whenever I wanted to do something."
"Oh dear Frusci thanks!I was reading on flyertalk to try the TK elite number:+908503330849Check out flyertalks TK forum, theres a discussion about it.Let me know if it works.I'm not elite member but basic Miles and Smiles but flying business so might give it a go.I know with Emirates their Skywards no always worked for me when I was silver.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Becosy at Trou aux Biches and Veranda Palmar at Belle Mare have offered their hotels for quarantined people:Be Cozy customers, 50 people, were welcomed at Trou aux Biches Hotel thanks to the benevolence of the Beachcomber group,"" said Ludovic Lagesse, CEO of Trimetys Hotel. According to the latter, Be Cozy employees returned home, and no staff member was in contact with the people in the quarantine center. Cleaning and meals in the rooms are organized by the Ministry of Health.Other groups have decided to follow in the footsteps of Trimetys Hotel. ""All of the hoteliers and AHRIM have already responded, everyone is playing the game in a patriotic spirit,"" explains Ludovic Lagesse. The rooms at Be Cozy are equipped with TV, telephone, fridge, air conditioning and fan.The Veranda Palmar hotel of the Veranda Leisure & Hospitality (VLH) group, in Belle-Mare, has also made its rooms available to the government. Thus, Veranda Palmar will welcome people who are placed in quarantine. “As a hotel group and a citizen of Mauritius, we stand in solidarity. We are doing our best to help the government in this difficult situation. As we ensure the safety of our customers and our staff, it is also our duty to ensure the safety of our citizens. This is the result of a collective effort.

"Thanks Bronia, i'll give that a shot."
I think you might have to key in your Miles and Smiles number when/if you get through.
I don’t use Turkish so only a basic member :/I’ve made a reasonable effort to get through to both my trip and Turkish. Plus taken a picture of the website error. So not going to devote too much more time to this.Got other things to consider now :( My wife suspects they may cancel her leave. Given my parents strict instructions to self isolate. 5 y/o is crying at the prospect of going to school without her friends. So think I’ll be house mum for the time being. And courier for my parents.
"Anyone who booked through Voyage Prive managed to get a refund?We've been offered a credit, but due to personnel circumstances won't be able to use it, so have asked for a full refund.Our insurance doesn't cover it as package holidays are covered by ATOL.Our ATOL certificate says we are allowed a refund, but VP aren't giving us one, stating that ABTA are agreeing with the travel voucher not a refund .Any suggestions?"
"Haven't managed to get through to Voyage Prive byphone, but did get an email response back. Our booking is hotel only. They've also offered us credit.I've responded and explained given my wife is a clinician in a major London Hospital, getting annual leave is going to be hard for us. Already mutterings about leave being cancelled. And then they will have a backlog of patients, so it's likely going to be a case of last minute allocation of leave when the clinic can afford to have her off work. I've offered to provide proof to Voyage Prive, but havent hear back yet.Havent heard back yet. I would be prepared to change dates to Xmas/Easter on the understanding they are cancellable if she can't get leave. But can't seem to get through to them :(Fortunately my insurer has confirmed i'm covered. They said just decline the credit and get written confirmation from Voyage Prive. Then I can file a claim with them.I dont want to take money out of the system. Airlines, hotels, agents, insurers need it more then me right now. But if I can't get through to anyone (not their fault, I know they are busy) I'll just have to put in the claim with the insurance.In a similar position with Turkish Airlines/Mytrip. Cant get through to either, so been forced to email and request cancelation and refund. If I didn't then insurance wouldn't cover me :( Ideally I would have preferred to rearrange so they could keep my money as well."

My travel agent told me a lot of the hotels are working with skeleton staff. I suppose we have to be patient
"Hi everyone, I got some issues with contacting my travel agent - EMAIL FLIGHTS - as well as Air Mauritius, my flights were ATOL protected. Did anyone ever got a refund through ATOL ? I`m not really familiar with the procedure, any explanation would be appreciated. Regards"

"Any one booked with BA Holidays.... I got an email from them yesterday confirming a full refund within 7 to 10 days. (Flight and 4 days at St Regis). So perfect news from BA.Now just waiting for confirmation of refund from Sportif Travel for 10 days accommodation at Riu le Morne, transfers and 10 days windsurfing hire at Ion Le Morne. We were so looking forward to getting back into windsurfing after hubby tore his achilles heel tendon. Hope the winds will be kind and steady for us in the UK this summer."
broniaNot yet. Will probably try Monday. Cant face the hold music again for a while :)
"Hi Bronia, It has actually been extended. Please see mail received by the Beachcomber group on Friday as we were due to arrive 10 April.BEACHCOMBER TOURS ANNOUNCEMENTIt is sad for us to report that the Government of Mauritius has made the decision that no foreign nationals will be allowed to arrive in Mauritius as from 19 March 2020. Although this is a temporary measure, the Government has taken the decision to extend the travel ban until the end of April. This decision was made after three cases of COVID-19 were reported on 18 March. All individuals who have tested positive have been placed in quarantine and government officials are doing their best to contain the infection and transmission.As of 20 March, as an additional measure the Mauritian Government has placed Mauritius in a state of quarantine for 15 days to attempt to flatten the curve of infections.Beachcomber will keep in close contact with all relevant stakeholders and airlines and will contact our travel agencies and partners as soon as we have updated information to share."

"TLDR:Email for THY: infolondon@thy.comNumber that worked for me: 020 7471 6666 and went via miles&smiles optionSpoke to THY (Turkish Airlines) yesterday afternoon (020 7471 6666 and went via miles&smiles option). Took ~20 mins to get through. Was either lucky or people have got their answers and it's less busy now.They confirmed my flights are cancelled and I have option of refund (via agent) or switch to flexible ticket. But because my 1 y/o turns 2 soon, the latter doesn't work for me :( Also flexibility is until 28/02/20. I got the impression provided route remains the same there wouldn't be an extra charge, but didnt explore further.However, because I booked through Mytrip I'd called them first. Spent 3 hours on hold. Only to be told I needed to call the airline to ask them to authorise refund. I knew this wasn't true having spoken to THY a couple of weeks ago when the schedule changed. But the MyTrip call agent was insistent. Despite my explaining I'd spent 3 hours on hold and they hadn't answered any of my emails and had already spoken to THY.In the end I called Turkish Airlines and the call agent was very helpful. Confirming there was no reason MyTrip couldn't give me a refund as my flights had been cancelled. She couldn't issue the refund as it was booked via MyTrip. But she gave me their central office email address and said to give them a try as they may be able to do something (infolondon@thy.com).I've come to the conclusion MyTrip are trying to avoid issuing the refund, as THY have confirmed twice they are able to. So I've reluctantly contacted my Credit Card and raised a dispute. Card company must be used to this, as not much explanation needed. They said they'll raise the dispute and request any further information as needed.Hope this helps anyone else booked with THY.Edited: 6:12 am, March 24, 2020 "
"Thanks Frusci.I do hope you get your refund. MyTrip are behaving despicably.Last night abox marked Attention! came up on top of the options we spoke about the other day - cancel or change flight.At last I thought, we can do it online.Went through the rigmarole of a change with dates to November and at the end the same red error message came up!So will give that (020 7471 6666 number a go this weekend. It would be good also if they dont increase the price with no extra charge as when I was checking alternative dates last night they seemed similar prices but then changed - one was £1500 more!Thanks again for that info!"
"NP, good luck.I'm pretty sure the Credit Card dispute will do the trick. Given the airline are issuing refunds, MyTrip havent got a leg to stand on. But as a backup I also have my travel insurance.Just annoying the way they are behaving."
"Frusci Turkey is grounding all international flights to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on Friday.https:/…news"
"Thanks for the heads up.Our flight was 2 days ago. They cancelled that a week ago anyway. Still nothing from MyTrip, but I've raised a section 75 claim with my card provider so will sit back and wait now."
I wasnt sure of your dates Frusci.I wish you the best with MyTrip and if they don't come through for you with your card provider.Maybe another year for you!
"Thanks. Pretty confident card provider will deal with it. It's a clear cut case because THY were issuing refunds.Even after this pandemic is over, my wife's been told annual leave will be difficult due to back log of patients. So its going to be a case of whatever/wherever is available when they tell her she can have time off. Unless we leave her at home :D"
"BroniaAfter a week locked in the house with the kids, not so sure she'd be the one losing out if we went with out her :D (As she's pointed out when we joke about going without her).Luckily we did two big holidays last year because we thought it would be more difficult once our eldest was of mandatory school age. We didn't expect this though :(THY deserve a lot of credit. Switching cheap tickets to flexible reschedule without any surcharge for new dates. And even offering a straight refund without making you jump through hoops. If it wasn't for our youngest turning 2 and them only offering up to 28/02/20, I'd have opted to keep the tickets."
"Thanks, sure we will sooner or later :)"
