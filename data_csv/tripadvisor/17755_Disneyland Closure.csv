Months ago we planned a Disneyland trip for 5/16-5/22 I've been watching the closures lately and it looks like Disneyland is not taking any reservations until June. Does anyone know if this means that this is the earliest the park could possibly open? My hotel reservation is off-site so I can't really call Disney about lodging. Anyone have any more info?
Hope your reservations are cancellable and refundable.Governor Newsom’s pronouncements don’t seem conducive to a June re-opening of Disney. Disney Executive Chair Iger is on the governor’s task force.
"Yes, flights are with Southwest points and can be cancelled up to one hour before departure and hotel is a day or two notice. Pretty much planned on not going but I still keep checking."
"If you really want a Disney vacation, it looks like WDW will be open long before Disney in CA."
"Here are the governor's criteria for re-opening:“The ability to monitor and protect our communities through testing, contact tracing, isolating, and supporting those who are positive or exposed.”“The ability to prevent infection in people who are at risk for more severe COVID-19.”“The ability of the hospital and health systems to handle surges.”“The ability to develop therapeutics to meet the demand.”“The ability for businesses, schools, and child care facilities to support physical distancing.”“The ability to determine when to reinstitute certain measures, such as the stay-at-home orders, if necessary.”Since widespread testing and therapeutics (among other of the criteria) aren't even on the horizon yet, it's going to be a while. https:/…"
"""If you really want a Disney vacation, it looks like WDW will be open LONG [emphasis mine] before Disney in CA.""Citation? And don't say it's because the loony FL governor wants it that way."
"Blitz Blitz, No one here knows when the parks will open again. In fact, no one in the Disney fan community knows the answer. You need to follow or check Disney Parks Blog or OC Register to get first hand news or even hints. Have you joined Disboards? Do you follow Disneyland You Tubers? There are guesses at this but they vary wildly. I heard three different guesses last week from very prolific Disneyland you tubers with lots of park experience, including one who knows the prior CEO of Disneyland. What can I say except no one knows.Anyone who gives you ANY information pertaining to Disney that does not come directly from Disney is guessing, speculatingIf you want to make definite plans right now than make plans for next year. You could try planning for November, in my opinion, just consider that you might need to cancel. The reason being no one knows. No one has a crystal ball into the future."
"They announced we won't be having any concerts or sport events where a large group gathers this summer Assume Disneyland definitely falls under the category of high volume where crowds go. I also need CA would be working with Oregon and Washington during the transition to keep the west coast safe So, other states won't be allowed forawhile. They say everything will be based on science to make these decisions."
Thank you everyone for taking time to post what you know. It sounds like there is no way that a May 16 trip will happen. We kind of figured. I was really wanting to go to Disneyland as we've been to Disney World several times before. There will be other times to go. Thanks again.
"Believe it or not, but governors can say or do whatever they want and they cannot FORCE any place to open. Places open if they want to and think it is safe.The Florida governor isn't king of the world. Disney resorts closed down WORLDWIDE in the middle of March for safety reasons. That stupid FL governor didn't issue a stay at home order until the beginning of April."
"Saw this article this morning about when Disney parks ""might"" re-open (Possibly not until Jan 2021):https://www.deseret.com/entertainment/2020/4…Edited: 3:25 pm, April 21, 2020 "
May? No Way.June. Too soon.July? Probably a lie. Anyone want to add on?
"August? Not in the slightest?(It has to rhyme, right?)"
"Disney cannot afford to be closed for that long. Period, end of story. Anaheim's economy cannot take it if Disney is closed that long, they'll be nothing if Disney is closed until next year. So much of Anaheims money come into the city from Disneyland. Its just a waiting game right now and take it one day at time. The heat has yet to come. Here in Utah we are opening dining rooms and allowing elective surgeries starting 5/1. I know this isn't CA but they have a had a lockdown much longer than we did so hopefully they can restore some normalcy in the coming month.Edited: 9:22 am, April 22, 2020 "
"""Disney cannot afford to be closed for that long. Period, end of story.""Oh, since you wrote the word, ""period"" it must be true. The virus will decide when Disneyland will reopen.""The heat has yet to come.""Science currently doesn't know what role weather will have on the virus."" Here in Utah we are opening dining rooms and allowing elective surgeries starting 5/1.""Let's check back in 8 days and see what happens.Edited: 11:32 am, April 22, 2020 "
Looks like Disneyland might not open until January 2021.
"Jyee24,Don't believe and spread rumors. What you are hearing is not coming from Disney.What would you do if someone wrote something about things closing in San Francisco or not opening until 2021, whenever that may be. I could say I read it in some article somewhere and start spreading it around. That doesn't make it true. And by spreading a rumor you're creating financial problems for whatever City you're spreading it in. How would you like it if someone spread a rumor about where you lived? How would you like it if the economy went down there? How would you like it if home values went down there? How would you like it if unemployment spread? How would you like it if you were unemployed for months and months until 2021 with no chance to find employment because your city was falling apart because people spread rumors about it? Do you think that will never happen to San Francisco? Stop the spread of rumors!Edited: 12:34 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"^^^^ Loose lips, sink ships. FWIW I think January isn't a bad guess. But it's a guess. I think reopening major amusement parks, in a time of pandemic, is full of many difficulties."
"I see nothing wrong with speculating, discussing etc. We will know when each park is going to open when Disney announces it. Until then, we can discuss. That’s all we have now. Don’t take that away. Lol!"
"I hardly think a “rumor” in TA is having much of an impact on when Disney opens. But should an OP ask a question about prospects for a trip, it is open to discussion and opinions and counter opinions and so forth. It appears that the more experts learn about this virus, the greater the number of questions. That uncertainty is real even if by its nature intangible."
"And actually as of this morning, Elective surgeries and dining are reopening. I work in healthcare here and I had a patient tell me that ""I MUST reschedule her childs circumcision for today because as of yesterday they lifted the restrictions."" So, FLWfan1867, don't knock my elective surgery in 8 days.... its happened already, plus you don't live in Utah so you can't say anything about what we are or are not doing. Each state is on its own. I am sorry if I ""spread rumors"" which I didn't. I merely said that Anaheim and Disney are going to suffer if they don't reopen till January.Edited: 2:24 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"Disney still plans to pay out stock dividends, so it can't be in that much trouble.https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/abigail-…I'm one of those who believes we should start reopening some small businesses, parks and beaches under certain social distancing and mask requirements, but not Disneyland . They had that measles outbreak there a few years ago, which tells me it's a place that's very conducive to spreading infectious diseases, and I don't know how realistic it is to disinfect rides and food areas between customers."
"""FLWfan1867, don't knock my elective surgery in 8 days.... its happened already, plus you don't live in Utah so you can't say anything about what we are or are not doing.""Actually I can say whatever I want because I live in the USA. But I'm not sure what's so shocking (I know nothing about your surgery.) I was just saying about what Utah is going to do on May 1st to remember my mother's not original saying, ""God (or a virus) laughs at plans people make."""
"I don't understand re-opening businesses like beauty parlors, restaurants, and so on. Especially since they've now documented at least one instance when a restaurant's air-conditioning system circulated the virus to nearby tables. Social distancing won't be useful if the a/c is blowing the virus in your face.https:/…"
"Not me personally.... as of yesterday our governor lifted restrictions on elective surgeries and dining room restaurants. So nothing can happen within 8 days because we already opened them... yesterday. You can say whatever you want, yes, but don't think you know everything about Utah. Each state is different. And this is the official wording on the Disneyland app: ""For guest interested in Modifying their existing travel dates or making a new reservation for future vacation, reservations are currently available for travel dates June 1st, 2020 and later."" So it sounds like tentatively thinking June 1st but of course this could be pushed back as we see where we are in 6 weeks."
In CA it won’t be Disney that decides when to open. It will be the state. There is a financial analyst who has attracted a lot of press by predicting that Disney Parks won’t open this year. Economies come and go but you have only one life. Not to mention that people can infect others. If it was just stupid people infecting themselves I’d have no problem with it.
"""I don't understand re-opening businesses like beauty parlors, restaurants, and so on. ""Because people need to earn a living. It's easy for those who have enough money saved away and can sit this out to say others don't need to work. The latest indications are the virus isn't as dangerous as people originally feared, so open a few places and see what happens. If people suddenly start getting sick again, which is possible, shut everything down again.Edited: 5:25 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"MadelineM-SF, I understand that it won't be Disney that decides. I simply said that on their website it shows 6/1. That might be extended, it might not be. WE DON'T KNOW! If you don't want to go yourself if they do open this year then that is your choice but you can't stop those of us who do want to go this year. This is a free country and we can do what we want, you're entitled to your opinions but you don't need to share them with us. Also, I hope you've heard the saying ""Don't believe everything you read or hear."" Just cause someone posts something and predicts something doesn't mean it is true."
"As I said, if it was just people doing stupid things getting sick, it wouldn’t bother me at all. Fortunately our governor has been and continues to be quite cautious with regards to opening. This being a (fair,y) open forum I can say what I want. And I think you are hugely unrealistic about a Dis year opening. My public library says they’re closed to June 1 too but I GET IT. They’re not updating their site and either is Disney. The last thing this state needs is opening places like Disney."
Iger interview: https://www.barrons.com/articles/bob-iger-on…Better read it before it is censored as unfounded rumor since it is not an official Disney press release.
"Iger: I don’t think we’re ever going to see a return to business as usual. I can’t speak for all companies, but Disney will take this opportunity to look for ways to run our businesses more efficiently when we come back. So what we’re doing is thinking, OK, as things start to return, first of all, what must we address in terms of making people feel safe. But secondly, what must we address in terms of running Disney more efficiently, given what we believe business conditions will dictate.Here for anyone to dissect."
Informative article Liars. Must be a rumor coming from a Disney Executive but Not on Disney's web page. Rest assured they will survive the economic portion.Can't believe the other thread got zapped over an emotional rumor crisis.I mean A Pandemic that may end up worse than the early 1900's or Mickey Mouse surviving.
">>>Better read it before it is censored as unfounded rumor since it is not an official Disney press release.<<<Yes... ""people"" shouldn't be reporting threads and then getting their friends (or their multiple accounts) to censor the forum.My best guess is Disney World will open before the Disney California parks for a lot of reasons.I cannot see a June 1 opening day for Disney here. Maybe Oct 1."
"Iger: “One of the things that we’re discussing already is that in order to return to some semblance of normal, people will have to feel comfortable that they’re safe. Some of that could come in the form ultimately of a vaccine, but in the absence of that it could come from basically, more scrutiny, more restrictions. Just as we now do bag checks for everybody that goes into our parks, it could be that at some point we add a component of that that takes people’s temperatures, as a for-instance,” studying very carefully what China has been trying to do in terms of their return to normalcy [and] … You can’t get on a bus or a subway or a train or enter a high-rise building there—and I’m sure this will be the case when their schools reopen—without having your temperature taken.”“So we’ve asked ourselves the question, let’s prepare for a world where our customers demand that we scrutinize everybody. Even if it creates a little bit of hardship, like it takes a little bit longer for people to get in. Just as the case after 9/11 where people ultimately lived with the notion that in order for them to enter a building, if you’re in an office building you have to show a picture ID or get your picture taken and be screened. Or in order to enter a park you have to put your bags out there to be checked and you go through some kind of metal detector. Or certainly what’s going on in airports with the TSA.”So Iger is thinking hard about what a reopening entails. I would particularly underline what he said about the Chinese having entire layers of safety beyond what would be necessary to get into Disneyland Shanghai.We don’t have those layers."
">> I cannot see a June 1 opening day for Disney here. Maybe Oct 1.I was also thinking mid-Sept or early Oct is likely, especially if schools reopen. Disneyland will probably have to operate at reduced capacity, and it may be easier and more desirable from a PR standpoint to do that in the fall than in the summer. I also expect that we'll follow the pattern of the polio epidemics in the 1950s when there were multiple shutdowns lasting several months in various locales as the epidemic flared up in different areas. So even if Disneyland opens again in October, that doesn't mean it'll still be open in December."
"To get anything like a safe reopening, Disney will probably unfurlough a good chunk of their “cast members” to train them on new processes, new equipment, new interactive skills while retaining the smile of course. Then, we are likely to see rehearsals of opening.....that is what is going on in Shanghai Disney.....before we get a real opening. Whether Disney can sell a stay at its hotel without an entry into a park....."
"First of all, our currency is still doing better than most of Europe. And if it fell then we would be a cheaper place to visit. If our currency stays high, we're more expensive to visit. But neither issue is in play until international travel bans are lifted and nothing has been said about those. And a pandemic is not like any other world catastrophe. Everyone is experiencing this virus to some degree or another. And many countries (India? Pakistan?) who haven't had huge infections ... well you just have to add the work YET."
This post should also be moved back to the Anaheim forum from whence it came.
Why has a Disney “Land” topic appeared in the Orlando forum??
"Because TA mods don't know the difference between Disneyland and WDW.Edited: 1:01 pm, April 26, 2020 "
"If the OP contacts TA through the Help Center, he might be able to get the topic moved back to the right place. stress ""might""."
