I wonder if anyone is changing their reservations outside of the MGM group since they are bringing lawsuits to the shooting victims.People boycott for many reasons and I was just wondering if this is a deal breaker for MGM lodging.
"That's a bit of a simple description of what is happening. And no, I have not changed my plans. And you care about my plans because?? I friends in my home town who were at the concert. I don't agree with MGM's approach, but I'm also not qualified to give them legal advice."

"Not at all for me. I am from Vegas originally, and visit once a month or so to see family who still live there. After reading through the lawsuit I fully understand why MGM is taking the legal actions they are. They are simply seeking to protect themselves from lawsuits, not trying to get money from the victims.In my personal (note personal) opinion, they shouldn't have to compensate anyone for what happened. It was a tragic incident, but nothing they should be held liable for. It was a completely unforeseen incident. I suppose they could set up metal detectors like airports have for every guest to walk through, be patted down, and have their luggage searched. But as a frequent guest, I would not stay there if that ever happened. We do still have a reasonable expectation of privacy."
"Not at all, we will be at the MGM Grand in 17 days and intend to enjoy every minute of our visit. Plus I am in total agreement with post #3, JasonCedarCity_UT. They are trying to protect themselves (which I can't blame them, I would too if something happened that was beyond my control) and are not seeking money."
Completely agree with Jason and the Italianprincess. How about you OP? Do you have an opinion or are you just trying to stir the pot?
"I think people see the headline and don't actually know the full details of what's going on.At first I was shocked (based on the headline), but once I read what the lawsuit(s) are for/about, it's a non-starter for me.""MGM is not suing for money, but the company wants a federal court to rule that it cannot be held liable for the shooting by more than 1,000 victims and others it named in the suits. The company said it named only people that have already sued or given notice that they intend to do so."""
"I agree with others who posted. We will be there in a week, no changing plans ;)"
I'll be at the Bellagio in three weeks. No change here.
No changes here. Waiting for March offers to come out and will either be at Mandalay Bay or Delano the 8th-10th.
I'm hoping to capitalize on it :) If prices keep dropping I may be staying with MGM for the first time. Never stayed or really visited the south strip area beyond NYNY but if the price is right I will. I understand what they did from a fiduciary responsibility aspect. Business decisions are made without emotions. Some people find that hard to swallow but it's reality. Hopefully there will be some kind of campaign to bring visitors to the south strip.
"Reaching a fair settlement, regardless of what you or I think it should be, is bound to be a tedious and complicated process. It's how the system works for better or for worse. Make a judgement when it is all over if you like. But to do so over typical legal maneuvering is foolish and unfair."
"""suing the victims"" may be technically correct but it's misleading IMO. This is just legal maneuvering re: venue, as I understand it.On-topic, this wouldn't change my plans at all."
It crossed my mind when I saw the headlines but that faded quickly once I read more about it. I'm very comfortable with the situation as far as visiting MGM properties. I feel very bad for the the survivors and the families involved.
"Nope, hasn't/won't change our plans. After all, it is not the typical law suit, as many of the prior posters have already elaborated on. MGM is not asking anything from the victims, as MGM is also a ""victim"" here.Nevertheless, since July 10th we had/have bookings at Skylofts, Delano, Signature, and Bellagio...all MGM properties. We have completed two of the hotel stays, now for just the other two hotels for the remaining 3 weeks of our stay.It's still Vegas Strong Baby!"
Nope. We have four days in august and 3 in November.
"For all the people saying MGM is a victim, just remember that when you choose who to sue when the surgeon has an accident while operating on you, the teacher molests your kids, your plane crashes because of pilot error, you are in a car accident, a drug gives you cancer etc.For every winner in a lawsuit, there is a loser. MGM is doing this to make money or lose less, just like resort or parking fees. But I guess every one thought was MGM was a victim of inflation and were 100% right in these fees."
"I am on the record as being no fan of MGM management but I can't find any fault in MGM taking this action. I don't stay at MLife properties though recent offers have me rethinking that.I've seen it reported that MGM PR was slow to respond to the court filings, I think that was probably by design as there was no spin that was going to work in this situation, After a few days the education campaign began to explain the MGM position, based on the comments so far, it seems to be working.I think this is a legitimate question and don't think the OP was attempting to ""stir the pot"". You can bet that if occupancy falls during this quarter that MGM will cite it as a reason when they next report."
"“For all the people saying MGM is a victim, just remember that when you choose who to sue when the surgeon has an accident while operating on you, the teacher molests your kids, your plane crashes because of pilot error, you are in a car accident, a drug gives you cancer etc.”This comment of yours only makes sense and can be applied to MGM if you mean that all crimes that occur on American soil should have the Federal government liable, since the crimes occurred on US soil. Which makes no sense after all...."
"I've spent a lot of money to maintain my Platinum status for the year. Unless MGM does something incredibly insulting personally towards myself or my wife, I plan on taking advantage of it. I don't agree with a lot of the moves MGM makes, but that goes for a lot of businesses."
"CET, Cosmo, and Boyd treat me better than MGM so no changes, I will continue to avoid gambling at MGM casinos.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Not in the slightest; & besides, why would I? Not that I don't necessarily feel sorry for the victims &/or their families this tragic event had affected; I most def. do. But to hold MGM (&/or any other concerns) liable for the horrific actions caused by one person or guest, it's completely unwarranted. Either case; MGM isn't suing for monetary reasons, but just to protect itself against a huge potential of nonending lawsuits.There will always be those few who'll make out MGM as being the arched enemy. Yet the legal firms &/or attorney's who immed. chased after these victims &/or their families, aren't necessarily what you'd refer to as being the ""cream of the crop"" bunch either. They essentially look at it as being a potentially huge open door moneymaker, merely so they can rake in wads of money off of the lawsuits."
"I hAVe been to Vegas 23 times and did enjoy all of the times I stayed at MGM Casinos. until about 4 years ago, Things have changed a lot. resort fees, parking fees, Escalating food and drink prices, super tight slot machines, air fare*and flight schedules(lack of direct flights)Suing victims, is not very smart and I would be flabbergasted if I was sued.I knew a guy who had been a bellhop for several years at the Mandalay. He could not stand what he saw and sometimes had to do to keep his job. He is a car salesman now.No doubt, some MGM employees should have seen and and questioned what the shooter was bringing in the hotel. I think the Venetian and Palazzo have way better security, like using mirrors to check under airport shuttles for bombs. Not sure they still have bomb sniffing dogs that they had about 10 years ago."
Nope...Delano in October!13
"Nope, not me! I agree with poster #3 and #4. Also, I will always stay at the place I like the most that gives me the best deal. I do not allow social issues to dictate the things I enjoy. Not a fan of protests and boycotts! Maybe they will give me more resort credit!"
"“Suing victims, is not very smart and I would be flabbergasted if I was sued.” - You have to understand what their lawsuit is. MGM’s not suing victims for anything monetary, they’re just protecting themselves from being sued by victims because this tragedy could have happened anywhere at anytime. Also, you just said it yourself about being flabbergasted. Imagine being sued for something that you really had no control over. That’s basically what’s happened to MGM. You can say MGM should have noticed the guy carrying in all that luggage, but that’s just not realistic, especially over that long of a timeframe. 13"
"“No doubt, some MGM employees should have seen and and questioned what the shooter was bringing in the hotel.”Why? Please elaborate."

"Nope. Getting Married at MGM Grand in September. I understand how bad it sounded and wish they went about it a little wrong but realize it is not what it seems. Like others have said, I am no legal expert and think it is mostly the insurance companies who were doing this. MGM probably had very little imput."
I'd still stay at Mandalay Bay. It's a wonderful property.
"No,,,staying at Aria now, I have no problem with MGM taking legal steps,to attempt to protect their shareholders. I can’t blame MGm for a madman’s actions."
"This lawsuit makes a lot of sense, mostly because it’s 1 lawsuit. Just ONE. I have read that as many as 2500 individuals either have filed suit or announced they will probably file suit. No matter how big a company is, fighting one lawsuit takes less resources than fighting thousands. With this one lawsuit, win or lose it will be settled much faster than potentially thousands could be."
"For me it's the never ending increases in the resort fee and parking charges that are the deal breaker Those added to the room rate make their grottiest hotel , and they have a few of those , nearly $100 a night"
"""grottiest"". Is that a typo or an UK thing? I googled it and nothing came up."
"Besides the guns and huge amount of ammo, police photos show lots of heavy power tools that would have a bellhop to wonder what made the luggage heavier than just clothing. Most people arriving by air have weight limits on suitcases. Yes I did read the guy drove to the hotel."
"Besides the guns and huge amount of ammo, police photos show lots of heavy power tools that would have a bellhop to wonder what made the luggage heavier than just clothing.There are lots of gun and and other trade shows in Vegas so why would heavy baggage be unusual."
"“grottiest"". Is that a typo or an UK thing? I googled it and nothing came up.”UK thing.Root word “ grotty”. “unpleasant and of poor quality.""a grotty little hotel""Edited: 2 years ago "
"Post #26. Reports say that the guy was bringing large amounts of heavy baggage through the service elevator, not the regular elevator that vacationers use to get to their rooms. Some would say that this is not common, and should have raised some red flags. Post #34. I doubt that he let any employee bring those bags to his room. He lived in Mesquite, so yes, he drove."
It has come out that MGM covered up another failed shooting back in 2014 that would have happened in the same manner. MGM knew what could happen because it already almost did happen.I am with the victims and will not spend money with MGM directly.
Just stayed and will stay again. To me sueing the victims is a stretch. They are trying to avoid paying which I would do as a business as well in their situation. Just because something terrible happens does not mean the place it happens is responsible and doesn’t mean the victims families should get money from an innocent party.
"@Ticktock How did they ""cover up"" the 2014 incident? He was arrested and convicted."
I stay at Ceasar's hotels but i won't stop going to the Restaraunts and shows at MGMs properties. I dont agree with them suing the victims but you also have to understand that millions of people are employed by MGM and they dont deserve to suffer over this.

"We stopped staying at MGM properties when they stopped offering regular smoking rooms.There's really nothing wrong with what MGM is doing here with the ""lawsuit."" They're protecting themselves. Stephen Paddock is dead, but people still want to place blame on someone and get revenge in some way. MGM is a big company. It has a lot to lose. The financial loss could be enormous. No one can blame them for using legal options that can help protect them from that. The shooting was not MGM's fault."
"They kept it out of the press as much as they could. Including details. And no one said it wasn't out there, it is just that your average tourist would not have heard about it. Mostly just those of us that really like Vegas."
"So wait ticktock, you're saying MGM should have publicized it? Taken out ads? Besides being bad for business, would it have even been wise from a public safety standpoint? First off, that incident was a success. A tragedy was averted and if anything it should be a credit that MGM has able to stop it. But yes, lawyers from both sides can and should look at it, the policies in place, and ask why it didn't work this time. Did MGM make mistakes? This is fair and it's all part of a long and complicated process. Which will result in a settlement. Just as this lawsuit is."
What Ipshea said tictock. This is the sort of post that annoys me (add it to the threads about what annoys people.) The OP has not added one comment since the original post. Clearly this was just intend to fan the flames.

kinda heavy handed response by MGM but does not change my plans. Also does anyone really want their hotel auditing what they have in their luggage and what you are doing in your room?Edited: 2 years ago 
"""does anyone really want their hotel auditing what they have in their luggage and what you are doing in your room?""Mine? No. But I'd like the hotel to take some reasonable precautions to keep ""you"" from filling a room with guns and perhaps explosives..."
"""some reasonable precautions""What would be reasonable?"
I haven't dealt w MGM in quite some time anyway although I like visiting their hotels to walk around and throw a $20 into a slot here and there. I don't think what they are doing is right but I don't think it matters. I think they will lose. I have no legal reason for why I think that but it seems they're counter suing because they know they will lose and they want to scare the victims.Edit: I see some ppl are saying that countersuing was the right thing to do from a business perspective. Okay. But I think the victims have a strong case anyway. Alot of red flags should've went off that day.Edited: 2 years ago 
"""What would be reasonable?""I dunno, somewhere between the current ""mostly nothing"" and a strip search with a cavity inspection. ;-)More seriously, the revised policies of some properties that they'll enter your room to check every few days even if you have the DND up permanently seem reasonable, for example."
No change at all for me. I like MGM and I don't hold them one bit responsible for that shooting!
"No I like the non MGM properties more like Wynn, Encore, Red Rock Casino."
"I really don't think the OP is trying to 'fan the flames' at all. Seemed to me a legitimate request for how we see MGM at the moment. Every one of Jays posts on this topic seems confrontational, it may be because they've been personally affected by the tradegy but I honestly believe the OP was just asking a viable question and doesn't have to share their own thoughts, especially as they may not really know how they feel and are canvassing opinion."

"""the revised policies of some properties that they'll enter your room to check every few days even if you have the DND up permanently""So after having done performed a room check, how would that prevent any person from carrying out &/or accomplishing what this madman had originally done? Absolutely nothing! All it takes is a really good marksman (which this guy evidently was) along with less than an hour & a half of their time if even that, to successfully do whatever it is they want to carryout.Search someone seen carting in a large number of baggage items; really now? What about all of the other guests seen towing along their bags who could just as easily pack an array of guns & ammunition inside of their cases as well? Are you going to allow them to skip the entire search process & proceed thru up to their room, then unpack, load &/or setup, & go at it?

"""So after having done performed a room check, how would that prevent any person from carrying out &/or accomplishing what this madman had originally done?""I'd read that he accumulated his arsenal over the period of several days, during which the DND was on the door and housekeeping did not enter.

"""So, confiscation?""Not sure how completely effective that'd be, but if that's your suggestion I'd be willing to give it a try.Might be too radical, but I do firmly believe that we need to move from where we are on this.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Definitely not for confiscation. And ""epidemic of gun violence"" is a nice buzz phrase but not true. I know you're a smart guy and I respect your Vegas insight, but I'd suggest you do a little research on the use of firearms in the US. Find an independent study - not Everytown or the NRA - and you'll see the epidemic is a creation of people with an agenda. The 1 October incident was a horrible and horrific occurrence but an outlier on the gun violence spectrum. Oh, and the lawsuit by MGM hasn't made me change my plans - to stay on topic ;)"
"Has not changed my plans.In our litigious society ( mesofielioma, Botched Hernia, drug prolems, Auto Accidents, Hospital malpractice ads on TV all the time encouraging law suits) , I can see why MGM would try to protect themselves for potential years of litigation."
"Yes, it has caused me to change my plans.If I understand the procedural rules correctly; this suit causes further consternation and hardship for the victims and their families.Basic service entails a visit from either the mailperson with a registered mail green card, process server or sheriff. They will also have to engage an attorney, preferably with prior experience in federal filings, to file an answer to maintain their status in the suit. This maneuver will effectively eliminate a certain percentage of the party defendants.My concerns are not with the guns in the room, but the resort’s response. If there had been a fire, did the resort attempt to handle it in-house, delaying a call to the fire department? Did people die, or were injured because of their delay?MGM Resorts is a vendor, nothing more. If I purchase an airline seat, rent a hotel room or a car; and I question the value of my purchase or integrity of the vendor, I exercise my option to take my patronage elsewhere.After a recent unpleasant stay, see my reviews, I question my safety; this suit has caused me to question MGM Resort’s integrity. Sometimes doing the right thing is not the same as what you should do. I have changed my reservations for September and December to vendors further north on the Strip. Arlene"
Whatever credibility TickTockMan had here is gone now. 13
"“This maneuver will effectively eliminate a certain percentage of the party defendants.” - you are correct...it’ll eliminate the lazy and ignorant folks that are just trying to collect money from a national tragedy that MGM had no control over. Once they realize they actually have to work with due diligence to prove they were affected in a negative way, instead of just being able to claim they were, they’ll have no interest in pursuing the matter further. 13"

"Thanks TA, for reopening this."
"Thank you TA for reopening this.The Casino Hotels have Gun Shows every few months. The South Point just had one. The SHOT Show is held in Las Vegas each year. http://shotshow.org/ That is the largest gun event in the world for the trade. I used to go every year when I owned a company that sold related items (not guns). MGM International needs a new PR team to explain why they filed the lawsuit in Federal Court. They should have started explaining this before filing suit. They did not, and that is why they are getting bad press and why room rates have been lowered.Edited: 2 years ago "
Maybe you need to lose a few family members and friends and see if your views still stay the same.
You folks that are commenting about MGM should sue and you support their cause need to lose a few family members and friends and I guarantee you that your viewpoint changes.
>>>You folks that are commenting about MGM should sue and you support their cause need to lose a few family members and friends and I guarantee you that your viewpoint changes.<<<I know three people that were ambushed in this tragic event. You have no idea of my viewpoint and how hard this hit the Las Vegas community of over 2M people. It hit hard. #VegasStrong
"TA, close this thread already."
"DT, stop reading it if you’re not interested. Some nanny already had it closed and TA agreed to reopen it."
I wasn't reading it.
"Not at all , MGM properties have looked after us for the last 5 trips . Still get good offers . The headline sounds terrible, but it’s not what it reads if you look into it further."
">>>The headline sounds terrible, but it’s not what it reads if you look into it further.<<<Bingo."
This action by MGM isn't about trying to prevent compensation payments. Many of these claims would in all likelihood ultimately fail anyway. It's about trying to prevent years and years of litigation and incurring huge legal costs in having to defending such claims.Edited: 2 years ago 
Thanks for reopening the thread. We were in LV when it happened and the shock we felt has never left us (we were fortunate not to be out and at that end of the strip when it happened). However the action taken by MGM won't prevent me from staying at their hotels. I don't know the full details of the action but I don't believe it's comes from a malicious place.
"By no means do I think ANY casino resort management thinks of its customers first. As a shareholder I understand the reason.The simple description of what is happening is not accurate, in my opinion. They are not my god, and I do not idolize any corporation. Therefore, No It has And no it has not changed my plans. In fact, since making Platinum again I probably will go more. I made Diamond again last month, but with the terrible rooms and virtually everyone having Diamond and Platinum at H, it makes me run to Mlife. In fact I suspect prices keep dropping. I understand what they did from a fiduciary responsibility and I bought more stock! I wish I had voting rights haha."
You: And you care about my plans because?? Me:That person probably can't decide what way to go (change his or her plans or don't change his or her plans) and is trying to see what everyone else is planning to do so that he or she can assure himself or herself that he or she is making the right decision. I don't think that person is trying to be nosy.
"Yes, I am definitely frequenting MGM casinos less.If anyone was a victim of this tragedy and got sued by MGM, how would you feel? A lot of people patronize MGM because they only care about themselves and not anyone else. MGM is trying to say that they do not have any responsibility for the incident. It's a bit disturbing that so many people seem to think that this could not have been ameliorated, if not prevented, and that MGM has no responsibility. Realize that Las Vegas casinos are some of the most secure places in the world. Do you know the magnification that the eyes in the sky have? How many armed security guards are in the casinos? MGM waited over 10 minutes after the first security guard was shot before dialing 911 because they wanted to see if there own security could handle it to avoid bad PR, even when the guard that was shot was imploring them to dial 911. Is it not suspicious for a single person to bring in 20 suitcases to a room? Cameras in Las Vegas can AUTOMATICALLY track a patron through a casino without any intervention from a human. He could have been asked if he was there for a trade show. Does anyone have any idea of the level of technology that is used to catch cheaters? It is more sophisticated than 95% of people know. The casino was not prepared for a mass shooting event, their resources were focused on catching cheaters."
