"Good evening. My partner & I have a trip booked but not til the end of July. We are keeping a keen eye on what is going on. Today (12th March) I received an email from Smart Traveller which states that ""Macau has reported a number of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases."" Are they just stating the original 10 or is there another outbreak in Macau. As a result they are also stating that there may be ""quarantine or medical observation for 14 days."" Our trip is only for 4 days in Macau then on to Koh Samui. We are trying not to panic at this stage. I have been reading all the posts and recommended sites and I think I am getting a total overload of information. I sincerely hope that Macau is still incident free. Thank you to all the posters that are keeping us up to date on the situation."
Four people returning from Spain went into quarantine yesterday but there have no reported new cases of Covid-19 in Macau since Feb 5. The infection count was at 10 but each of those have since been cured and are now out of the hospital. See post #1 for the updated list of countries for which arrivals may face medical screening and possible quarantining as 12 March 2020. The problem is this list is growing every week so by July it could be much longer and include people who have spent time in many other nations during the 14 days prior to entering Macau. All you can do right now is just watch and see what happens during upcoming months.
Thank you . Its good to know what is going on from someone situated there. Thanks again.

"Hiro, Did you speak with someone who can clarify the latest entry restrictions? The Macau Business write up contradicts itself and creates a bit of confusion at least in this English language article. At one point it suggests that 'anyone' who enters Macau will face quarantine at home or at Pousada Marina Infante hotel. It immediately follows by quoting the Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture that 'Anyone, whether resident, non-resident worker, or tourist, who has been in a country considered to be of high epidemic incidence will be redirected to a hotel designated by the authorities.'The write up in Macau News is more clear on the new ruling (see link). https:/…"

I’m confused. What about a foreigner coming from mainland China who has just been in mainland China? And nowhere else ? Do they get refused entry?
"Hiro is right, only residents of china, Taiwan, Hong Kong and of course Macau can enter, as of midnight tonight .Just confirmed at the senado square tourist office."
">>What about a foreigner coming from mainland China who has just been in mainland China? And nowhere else ? Do they get refused entry?Only Mainland Chinese, HKers, Taiwanese, Macanese and foreign workers in Macau are allowed in enter. No other foreigners. I think they will get refused entry."
"Macau Business - latest article (see link) https:/…In another update on local entry restrictions, Macau authorities announced today that starting from midnight of March 18 all non-residents will be barred from entering the city, with the exception of work permit holders – known as blue cards – and residents from Mainland China, Hong Kong or Taiwan.In short, no more quarantine. You will simply be barred from entry unless you are a legal resident of Macau, Mainland China, HK or Taiwan."

">>Anyone fancy testing the border defenses with a night time swim?<<That was indeed once the preferred method of entering from Zhuhai, as witnessed by the number of t-shirts, plastic bags, newspapers and other stuff wrapped around the razor wire which surrounded Ilha Verde!But these days they have narrowed the ""river"" so much it's probably easier to wade across at low tide - byo bolt cutters.As there is no ""facetious"" icon, I will add that the above is a JOKE.
