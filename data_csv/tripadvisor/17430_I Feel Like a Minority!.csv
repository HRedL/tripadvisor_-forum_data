"As I've been reading this forum the past few weeks, I'm shocked at the huge number of posters from across the pond! It almost seems like more Brits (et al) than Americans! Don't get me wrong, I love it. Just so interesting and unexpected. Love it!"
"I think the vast majority of Americans who go to Disney are very familar with US travel options and motel chains etc and don't need as much advice to plan their trip- they would tend to almost all have friend or reative who has been there, probably more than once.That said , I enjoy reading the posts too- especially when they deal with the ( perceived) oddities of US food- like our 'biscuits"" which to Brits are cookies and surely are not meant to be smothered in sausage gravy...I also have a greater appreciation of tehe variety of casual dining choices we have here seeing them through other eyes- though I will never be a fan of Golden Corral, I'm afraid...Sweet Tomatoes, yes, however!"
"yes, it is mainly the unfamiliarity of a foreign country. And driving on the 'wrong' side of the road, what things cost etc.After all, you'd be asking where to stay, what is near where, can I drive, where should I eat- if you were in London."
"Yes, I understand your explanations. But I've been on other travel forums, such as Cancun, and haven't seen as many British posters as on this forum. And Mexico would be just as foreign to them."
I never knew what a big seller Orlando was in Britain until I came on this forum and subsequently stayed on I-Drive. As a Canadian I was well aware there were lots of us there at all times but most people I met that year on the street and in the parks were British. I must admit I am fascinated by the amount of money spent on this type of tourism.
Our friends across the Pond get Very Nice Deals to come visit Disney World so it is very popular( wish we could buy those lovely Ultimate Tickets and get Free Dining just about every month of the year ;-)
"there are lots of british people on the new york forum. everywhere i've been (for example mexico, boston, even atlantic city i've met british people - they get around....lol, they're not all in florida :)"
You feel like a minority because you ARE a minority here. Except after 6 pm when they are all tucked away in bed ;) That is the only time I have to come on TA lately...way too busy during the day
"We get everywhere, we'like an epidemic !!Some of us have probably been to more places in the US & Canada than you natives have, what can I say, we like to travel ..."
"Some forums are like that, the Bali forum is mostly Australian...Another minority on the Orlando forum, is people not necessarily going to Parks and trying to find info on alternate things to do, places to eat.It can get lost in the mass of messages mostly related to Disney and other parks."
"With all of Florida to explore, I think staying in OrIando and not doing the parks is unfathomable really."
"Well, for me Orlando is convenient, close-ish (closer than Bali), prices are attractive, shopping is good and villas are a bargain.I can spend a week there just relaxing by the pool, having day trips to places like Cocoa Beach, KSC or Clearwater beach.One thing for all the people on this forum, they are passionate about Orlando and the Parks."
Is it cheaper for you to do Disney in Orlando than it is any of the other locations? Ihave been to Disneyland Paris and enjoyed it. It seems like it would be cheaper for our friends in the UK. Much more to do in Orlando I would say. I am always jealous of the way you guys can take like two week vacations to Orlando. I wish I could do two weeks for Disney/Universal/Sea world
"DLP is actually very expensive for us. We would only ever go there for 2 or 3 days and the cost is too much for that amount of time. It's also not as well organised as WDW and only a fraction of the size. Once you've been to WDW it kinda spoils it for DLP.We take our beach holidays in the Canaries which is a lot cheaper & more convenient than schlepping all the way over to American to sit on a beach. Five weeks today and I'm off to Lanzarote for a bit of sun, sea & sangria :)"
"There are loads of people from the UK on the road trip forum exploring the national parks. What amazes me are people like my friends who go and spend a month in Puerto Rico, 3 weeks in south Africa, a week in Paris... and have never been to the Grand Canyon or Bryce or Zion or.... lol We travel to Florida in the spring sometimes. Avoid Disney like the plague! :) Give me St Augustine, Amelia Island, Perdido Key.... but not Disney. To me, it's overly expensive and overly crowded. I think it's cheaper for people from the UK to travel here than it is for us who live here. Also see alot of LONG vacations that often we do not get who live in the US. It's great for our economy-- it's all good! :)"
"I am off to Malta in 3 weeks, but I LOVE sclepping to FL to sit on a Gulf coast beach!!USL, have you been to Key West?"
"I too am SUPER jealous of the loooong vacations Europeans get. When I'm on vacation, I don't get paid, so the most I've ever done is 7 days. LOVE to see what it feels like to have a month!"
"amanx, yes :)I don't like to schlepp !! lolHave they finished Malta yet? I couldn't figure out if they were building it up or pulling it down when I went!! lolEdited: 7 years ago "
"Wings, I just have to askWhat on Earth are you doing here on the Disney Forum ?Sorry, just find it funny and odd, after your comment about Disney :-)"
"DLP is quite different already weather wise, Spring and Summer can be nice but otherwise it's hit and miss.... I still don't understand why they chose Paris over Barcelona...And USlovers you're right exchange rate with the USD is much better for you.I'll be going to a Park for the first time since my first trip in 2004, Universal."
"Hiya Chiromommy~~~~~~Our Englisher,Scottisher,Irisher,and Welsher friends need sun.Most of em also like large Mice,if they're well dressed. You'd be 'hard pressed' to find a better destination than Orlando,for their needs and desires.((Get it? Chiropracter? Hard pressed? )) I make the little chiro humor/humour. Our crisp/biscuit snarfing compatriats also enjoy the large selctions of candies and adult beverages,sold in Walmart. Stick around and have some laffs. Sometimes we talk about tipping,and sparks will fly outta yer computer.. ;+)) Oh.. oh oh..and they say ""round"" instead of around,and they ""pop"" into places,rather than go in.They also get very fancy schmancy with the spelling,sticking the letter U almost everywhere that Americans do not. IE: ""What colour are your trainers."" Oh yeah,and they EAT tea. Don't ask me how. ;+))Edited: 7 years ago "
"I get a lot of PMs from people in Great Britain who want to know the practical aspects of a Disney vacation which I think people in the US mostly know. Things like where grocery stores are and whether they stock certain items. What kind of weather to expect. Restaurant ideas. Certain things we take for granted here-like doggy bags in restaurants-are Just Nor Done overseas. Why there are no electric kettles in US hotels(and having traveled extensively in Europe,we'd like to know the same thing,those suckers heat up water in 30 seconds)Tourists don't want to be embarassed or having to ask something they could ask on TA and get an answer to.And the guidebooks are often out of date and full of misinformation(as are many of the posts here)"
"Not just Brits, lots of Aberdonians lol"
"Not to mention how cheap our gas .. oops, petrol, is for the Brits.But has anyone else noticed how many people from Oz have been on the Florida forums in the past two months? It's almost as though the Florida Tourist Board ran a campaign in Oz to encourage them to visit."
"One reason I think you don't see many US posters on this forum is that they're all posting on disboards;. As busy as the TA forum can get, it's much busier over there."
"Oz runs a campaign both in the US and Uk, esp in the winter. In addition, the BBC runs a special program about emigrating to Oz now.I would expect our/the US tourist board does the same (but 6 months before their summer vacation maybe?Edited: 7 years ago "
"Disney Ads are on every other commercial right now. Kids are done with School in 4 months here by me, just enough time to plan that Summer Holiday :)"
"partypa-- I wander the Florida forums to see if I can answer anything for St Augustine, etc--periodically-- and noticed the subject line and it peeked my curiousity :)No offense intended that I do not care for Disney-- My son loves it and has already taken his 2 year old there. Just a fluke that I landed here. Don't mind, I hope? I just found the subject interesting regardless of the destination."
Here it's Universal Orlando and Disney Orlando or Paris on a steady rotation.Not sure if it's on British or Irish TV though....
"wings, all are welcome on the Disney ForumIt's the Orlando Forum you need to be careful of lolYou are welcome any time No offense taken :)"
"Personally I much prefer the beaches on the Gulf coast and the Atlantic coast in Florida to that in the Canary Islands. The water is warm too, especially on the Gulf side.We've visited Orlando only once in our many years of holidaying in Florida, preferring the coastal areas. Once our son and daughter can afford to take their children then we'll likely return."
