"My husband and I are set to go to Cancun in 2 weeks! We've been hearing that it is SUPER HUMID and that mosquitos are ready to eat you alive. How bad are the mosquitos in the beginning of August? Is it still super humid? We're beginning to think that we booked the wrong month. :,("
"Well, I'm sitting on the beach in Cancun right now and it's hot, breezy and humid - but not a mosquito in sight. Dusk apparently is when they're at their worst and didn't experience any last night either.But humid - yes.Ian."
In the hotel zone you rarely see any. In downtown yes they will eat you alive.
"I've heard that as long as you're in the hotel zone, you're fine. Apparently the hotels spray to help keep the mosquitos away. I hope that's true, we'll be there in August too. Just in case, I do plan on taking some mosquito repellent with me."
"also here now, had 1 on me since last tues..."
"Yes it's hot and humid in Cancun. VERY humid if you aren't used to humidity at all. They do spray for mosquitoes in the hotel zone, but if you are one that attracts them, you may want to pack spray. If you are venturing into the jungle (say to visit the ruins) you would definitely want a product like Deep Woods Off.I am one who is a skeeter magnet. I always get some bites, though I can only think of one trip where I got ""eaten alive"" in the hotel zone. We were dining outside and I ended up getting up and going to a pharmacy next door to buy bug spray in the middle of my dinner ... it was that bad. Now a days I buy bug spray if I need it. (I buy one that's a yellow can with a red cap that works well), but I always pack a benadryl itch relief stick since the one or two bites I do get, tend to drive me nuts."
"My wife and I will also be in Cancun from 7/31 - 8/7. I have no mosquito appeal, however she is quite the mosqo magnet. We will be purchasing some 100% deep and applying it to her as regularly as suntan lotion."
"I wish I was one of those lucky ones who never gets bitten while in the Hotel Zone. Unfortunately I am not so fortunate, and almost always get several bites. However where there are breezes, such as on the beach, you are far less likely to get bitten. The truth is, while there is spraying that happens, if you dine at any of the lagoon side restaurants, especially when outdoors from twilight until early evening, you do stand a better chance of being bitten. I find the best defense is Depp Woods Off with Deet. I have not found products with Deet while in Mexico, so I always bring it from home. I also prefer the wipes that come in individual sized packets, for easy and convenient portability..212eric (Author)PEOPLE'S CHOICE GUIDE CANCUN Travel Survey Guidebook"
We just got back from a 2 week stay. We stay on the Bay side and at night my wife who is a big magnet was bitten a few times when she didn't spray. Down town they were all over her in the evening. I had no problem with them but did notice a few at dawn on the beach a couple days.
"unfortunately the weather (warmer temps and earlier rains) has been causing a tremendous increase of those pesky mosquitoes throughout the entire caribbean. on sunday the AP published an article about the increase (to epidemic levels) of dengue fever (a mosquito borne illness) in the caribbean. while cancun was not specifically mentioned because it only listed those areas that have reached epidemic levels, it is important to protect yourself against this increasing mosquito borne illness in tropical climates. health officials expect it to be become worse as season progresses. as a frequent traveller to mexico and the caribbean i look at deet as my nighttime sunscreen!"
"The resorts do take precautions but please do take you own precautions when you visit other areas. According to todays newspapers , Tulum just reported the death of a 9 year old girl from the dengue hemorrhagic fever . The health ministry also says that the cases of dengue are double this year in Quintans Roo vs. last year. It also states the Yucatan has 18 percent of the total cases reported in the country.So do take precautions and it should not be a problem. I had the dengue hemorrhagic fever here in Cozumel a couple of years ago and I can assure you, you want to avoid it.Edited: 10 years ago "
I would also advise to be cautious if you have any symptoms once you return home. My Cozumel doctor told me recently that he often gets calls from US doctors who have difficulty diagnosing dengue because its not something they commonly see.
Lady Isobel and I will be taking loads of a product called Tabard. It was developed in Africa and the lotion is very much like a moisturiser. It does contain Deet but it's very effective against all biting bugs and it smells really good too.
"We got back two weeks ago, and the mosquitos were there... My son and I are havens of mosquitos and we made sure to bring a couple cans of Off and an After Bite eraser."
