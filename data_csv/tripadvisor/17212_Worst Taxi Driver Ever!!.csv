"I will start be saying I really struggled with if I should post about this or keep it to myself, however after some soul searching decided to say something so here it goes.After 7-8 weeks collectively in Jamaica and countless taxi rides and charters, route taxi's and even a couple of white plated private drivers (I know bad on me). I can honestly say I have never felt that i was taking my life into my own hands until the other night. After a ride from Ivan's at Catcha Falling Star with one of their recommended driver (Waynes World Taxi) I can say I have driven with the most unsafe driver in Jamaica. He was so stoned he could hardly open his eyes and his van reeked so bad of a Ganga that I seriously thought I was at a Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin reunion concert (ganga does not bother me nor does the smell of it) but my wife and my buddies wife could have done without it. He was weaving in and out of traffic wildly and driving faster than I could have thought possible down Norman Manley Blvd almost getting into several accidents. Anyone else with a bad experience with a bad driver that others should be warned of? anyone??"
"Yes, have had one ride we really thought we might actually die, similar to yours as far as weaving and excessive speed. It was a taxi we took from Chicken Lavish so never knew the name of the driver nor association with a particular property. It was on our first night (but not first visit). Think we were so tired and so excited to be there that we overlooked it. Also had a driver hit a goat one time.I am sure most people who have been to Negril many times have a crazy red plate driver story?The funniest ride ever, the guy drove painfully slow...not something common in Jamaica. He was quite stoned. One friend in front and 3 of us in back so could not figure out why he was driving do slow...turned out he was trying to sell his CD to friend in front and he was singing along. Have a great pic of driver with CD in hand.Did you ask the guy to slow down or tell Catcha about your experience?I would think a place like Catcha would not want to be associated with someone like this. There is a difference between ""spirited"" and downright dangerous and this guy clearly put your lives at risk. Good thing you all made it through the experience with no one hurt!"
"Wow, thanks for sharing that. It must have been a tense ride for you and you must have been so grateful to make it to your hotel safely! Sounds pretty scary....so this is a driver that Catcha sends their dinner guests ""home"" with? Have you emailed Catcha to let them know?"
"I have been swamped since back at work, but will be in the next day or so."
I found religion in a Negril taxi. I'm thankful to be able to type this. Seriously.
"Hey Walleyed, Was he a tall guy? Because I used Wayne a lot this last trip and he was never stoned, in fact, I do not believe he even smokes. It might be one of his drivers, and if so it would be good to let him know."
"Thanks for the tip Booger, he was fairly tall but I wouldn't say any taller than me and i am about 6 foot one. I have nothing against smoking Ganga and have smoked more than my share over the years, but my wife and buddies wife don't care for the smell or partake. The van reeked like we were front and center at a led Zeppelin or Grateful dead reunion show. And the guy at the wheel was definitely totaled. Either way I have e mailed Catcha and hope to hear back from them soon. I gave Catcha the date and where we were picked up so hopefully if it wasn't him they can let him know. Either way, just want I make sure people are forewarned!Edited: 7 years ago "
"Sorry you had a bad experience. We were picked up by Mike for our dinner at Ivan's who was a completely safe and reliable driver who we would gladly use again. If folks want, he would be a good one to request when communicating with Catcha."
Drunk drivers run stop signs. Stoned drivers wait for them to turn green.It seems kind of odd that someone who was high on ganja would drive recklessly. Usually that makes someone drive too slowly.
"haha, Nice post. Everyone be forewarned for a nondescript 'fairly tall' stoned Jamaican driver whose van smells like weed and swerves while driving! hide the women and children!"

Probably same guy that was piloting that Spirit Airlines plane coming down to MBJ !!!
"same guy who drove us from MBJ to Negril in 45 min when the main road was under construction...drove like a bat out of hell with his a... on fire, swerving, passing cars, doing about 90 all the way and nearly hitting a couple people in Lucea....white knuckles and wife a nervous wreck"
"Walleyed. The guy was probably not stoned, he was just ""self medicating his Bi polar disorder"". At least thats what most of them claim around here when they get arrested for DUI."
Hmmm just because the taxi service said waynes world or whatever doesnt mean it was wayne himself. Did you get his name badge? I have found out over the years after I have had friends get ripped off that if you take down there name badge and number you can report them to the tourist board and they can get in some serious trouble. My friend that got ripped off had a medical emergancy and the driver took total advantage of her. Of course after the fact she found out she could have reported it. Anyway just to let you all know for future take down the name and badge number just in case.......
"I did not take his tag number down, but I did take his business card. After reviewing the card again, the first name of the driver was Wayne and it was under Waynes World Taxi. I have received an E-mail from Catcha Falling star after sending an e-mail to them to express my experience and the said that they have had to warn him to slow down as he considers himself a ""confident"" driver, but also said that they didn't think that Wayne himself smoked so maybe he had someone driving for him. Anyone who has visited Ivan's and Catcha knows that up where you get into the taxi is a little on the darker side as there is not a lot of light and when boarding the taxi I didn't realize he appeared stoned. The Van however had a very very very strong aroma of freshly smoked ganga in it and he appeared stoned when we exited the taxi and were paying him. Combine that with the crazy ride it was not the most enjoyable experience for us. We buckled up and toughed it out rather get out pay a full fare and have to find a new ride the rest of the way home. I guess maybe we should have just gotten out, cut our losses and not said anything as I have received a nasty private message from one fellow board member for posting my experience. Maybe it was just Medicinal Marijuana..... ;)"
"While I am smiling at some of the posts, I have to say we used Wayne from Catcha for our airport transportation. Never again. The following year we requested a different driver. As a matter of fact, we would rather use the taxi driver who picked us up from dinner one night imbibed in the Jamaican herb to the point where he could barely see or talk â€“ where he drove in reverse for about a mile around the curves in the West End area late at night - yep, would rather use him for a ride than Wayne. Wayne is a great guy but would rather converse with him than ride with him."
"Must be an epidemic of bi polar disorder among these guys !!! Drunk driving is just plain ole drunk driving, not matter you're ""on""."
"Our only bad experience with a driver was one Catcha recommended. We told him we wanted a route taxi, he said he was a route taxi then he threatened and was very menacing to my husband when we got to the beach. We just paid him and route taxi'ed back. I don't mind paying for private, but not when we agree it's route and tell the driver multiple times to pick up any fares he sees and that we are not a private fare.I think they need to be careful with who they recommend. I also think the taxis should just post a basic fee structure for private fares, it would be so much easier than haggling each time and they are pretty standard. It could be a point of business for them that you don't need to haggle.Edited: 7 years ago "
"jodi - just so you know a route taxi would have dropped you downtown, where you would have flagged a second route taxi to take you to the beach.The driver assumed you were a charter when he was called by Catcha even though you said ""route"" and was dishonest when he took you straight to the beach and demanded his charter fee. Route taxis are usually flagged from the street, not called from a restaurant or resort."
"And we asked him about going past the roundabout - it was ""no problem man"". Catcha did not call him, he was at their gate - I said we were catching a route taxi - I said that very clearly to both them and the taxi driver. They said ""Here is one, use him"". I've ridden route taxis many times and I know to be clear. When I tried to hand him 200j, he would not take it, that is when we should have walked away. The threatening part was what was disturbing, I had walked away and my husband said he was reaching into his car like he had a weapon of some sort after being really ugly with him, so he just paid him.This was not our normal experience, this was the only time we ever had a problem with a route taxi or a charter. And it was our last day, so we didn't even think about reporting it."
"At least the cab drivers in Jamaica don't have those little ""shrines"" on the front dash !!! And they do speak English."
"Jodi: if you arrange to extend past his route (past the roundabout), you also need to agree on the price before you get into the vehicle. Going past his route changes it from route pricing to charter pricing. You could offer him a price for the two of you (no less than $500 would likely be accepted even when saying he can pick up other fares, perhaps more in the evening). That's $100j pp, for each leg - 1) cliff to roundabout; 2) roundabout to beach plus $100j for the convenience of not having to change taxis.Did you offer him $200j for just one of you? For going past his route, that would not likely be accepted even mid-day. You would have to change taxis at the roundabout to get that regular price pp during daylight."
"Look, I got uneasy when he passed the roundabout, and when he would not take my money, even though I said ROUTE TAXI like 20 times. I tried to give him 200j as we had been taking route taxis all week and I know you stop at the roundabout and catch the next one. Sometimes they are going the whole route - that also frequently happened and if we were going all the way to the beach they would tell me they were doing that and I would pay them 500j. Just be careful and make no assumptions - we'll be using a driver we know and chartering next trip, it's not worth getting threatened or stressed out about."
"Sorry, I'm obiously not following. I thought it was agreed before getting in that he would take you to the beach from Catcha, at which point it becomes charter pricing, and the price needs to be agreed upon before getting into the taxi. If you clearly told him you were just riding to the end of his route at the roundabout and he wouldn't let you out there to switch to a beach route taxi, that would be scary. I know route taxi pricing does increase in the evening, so it is always best to talk price in addition to clarifying that it's a route taxi, if you were riding in the evening. (I'm assuming it was evening as you were returning from Catcha) Like you, I would be nervous of using a route taxi after dark and would arrange a charter taxi ride. The usual price from Catcha for a charter is $10, I hope he didn't demand more than that! Sorry to hear of your bad experience."
