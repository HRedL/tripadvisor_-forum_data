"Good news (for St. Thomas and St. John, at least); herd immunity seems to have set in quickly, and reported CHIKV cases on STT have dropped like a stone. More details and a very encouraging graph in my VIOL post, here:virgin-islands-on-line.com/virgin-islands/…All the best,Kevin"
"Just as happened with dengue and as with other viruses, the epidemic status decreases as communities become more resistant to it. While it's reported that the ""epidemic"" status of chikungunya has now apparently passed in STT/STJ, reported cases on St Croix continue to rise. When the epidemic status has passed, nobody should slacken off in their use of repellents, and visitors should continue as always to observe the mantra of packing sunscreen and insect repellent in equal quantities! Neither the viruses or the sun's intensity disappear and we want you to enjoy your Caribbean vacation with no ill side effects!"
Great news! Wish Dengue was gone- too bad you don't get immunity from all dengue with one infection.
"owsa: ""Wish Dengue was gone- too bad you don't get immunity from all dengue with one infection.""No, but the good news on dengue is that Sanofi Pasteur's tetravalent vaccine will become available in the second half of 2015. It isn't perfect on all four serotypes, but it is quite good, especially on the variants in the Caribbean (it is a bit less effective on a serotype more prevalent in Southeast Asian strains). More details are available in the following links:sanofipasteur.com/Documents/PDF/Factsheet_De…sanofipasteur.com/en/articles/the-new-englan…All the best,Kevin"
Kevin- thank you so much for that info- I did not realize Sanofi would have it available so soon-
"""“We plan to submit the vaccine for licensure in 2015 in endemic countries where dengue is a public health priority,"" ...""The FDA is notoriously slow to license new drugs and, although other countries may act quickly, it remains to be seen how long it will take before it'll be available in the US. Keep packing the Deet!"
