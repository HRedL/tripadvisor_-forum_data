We are a family including 1 child and 1 infant. We made all arrangement to visit Baku from 14Mar2020 to 20Mar2020. Please let us know the effect of covid 19 in Baku. Are the tourist places still open to the public?Many thanks
"Hello, I read from the website below that tourist sites are closed and many restrictions are implemented which might heavily impact your trip.https://azerbaijan.travel/covid-19-enDue to sudden implementation, there is little information (in English) available online at this time so we need local experts here to confirm if these measures are indeed true and effective.Unfortunately the situation doesn’t look very good for now... I’m considering to postpone/cancel my Azerbaijan trip in April."
My visa was cancelled two days before my trip on 18th March.
mine as well. no point travelling anywhere these days. all borders are closed anyway.
Any ideas whether we can get a refund for the evisa or change for a different date once this is over?
