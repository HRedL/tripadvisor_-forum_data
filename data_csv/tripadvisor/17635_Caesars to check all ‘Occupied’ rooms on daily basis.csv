"Caesars Entertainment Corp., one of the world’s largest casino operators by properties, plans to have employees on a daily basis visually check all occupied rooms marked as “Occupied” as the hospitality industry confronts calls for improved security https:/…"
"If you're in the room, just put the metal latch over the door."
"Something disturbing about that for me. I understand there is a sway of support to protect peoples rights to buy multiple guns, but struggle to weigh that up against taking away my right to privacy and peace in a Hotel room i have paid for."
"Sounds shady... Always lock up your valuables in the safe before leaving your room for an extended period of time and put the safety latch on. Oh yeah, tip your housekeepers too :)"
"This disturbs me. I only go to Vegas for 3-4 days, mostly just 3. I put trash out in garbage cans on the way to somewhere because I prefer for my room to never be bothered while I'm there. I just don't like the idea of someone in my room I paid for while I'm not there. And I don't like having to lock my things up. I don't leave out wads of money or jewelry but I don't think we can trust every housekeeper working for these companies to not want to take nice things including clothes and shoes. And there is nothing to protect us from theft from employees. Once your stuff is gone, it's gone. The company does not care.I'm only there for 3 days and want my room left alone during that time. This decision was silly and a bit much and makes me think something other than safety is in mind..."
"In countless trips to Vegas and many vacations elsewhere I have never had anything stolen from my safe or from things I left lying around in my room. I personally like to have someone come in, tidy up, make my bed, and give me fresh towels when I'm on vacation because it's something no one does for me at home.I do wonder whether CET will stop offering incentives to decline housekeeping. Seems counterproductive to offer 10$ a day now when it will cost them to send security up to check the room"
"“Sounds shady” ??You think this policy was created to skim from customers? What do you mean shady? We all know why this policy is being put in place, we just may not agree with it."
"You mean security is going to come into my room? That means I'm going to have to deflate my ""Inflatable Companion"" I bring on solo trips each morning!"
"Ktinca- in that case, looking forward to your next solo TR. Please let us know how you you make out with securing and hiding your toys"
"I have had things taken and that's how I know that when it does happen, however rare, the hotel will not help you get it back."
"ktinca, lol. Yes, you definitely don't want that particlular item pilfered during these security checks!"
"Foodie...when you check into a hotel, you sign an agreement that the hotel isn't responsible for your belongings. The hotel has absolutely no proof what you state is missing was actually in your possession. Also, the hotel staff aren't professional investigators. They are people like you, which instead of having the job you have, they have a job at a hotel.Besides, if they were responsible to reimburse you, people would easily be playing that con game for all sorts of jewelry, electronics, money, cars, and everything else they could possibly get away with. There's a reason why they need to bolt down the pictures to the walls and screw the hairdryer cord to the wall. And to give you a hint...It's not because they think there'll be an earthquake."
"What concerns me the most about this new procedural policy is this. Will they be performing these room checks during various random hour periods of each 24-hr. day? All I got to say is that they better not be performing these room security checks during hours of the nights &/or earlier mornings while I'm asleep in my room. And for those who like to sleep in late in the mornings, I can see this as becoming a major & extremely irritable nuisance factor. Plus the thing is; once Security performs the room check, there's nothing to prevent someone from carrying out their evil ways after the room check. Besides, they would have to run daily room security checks whether or not the ""Room Occupied"" sign is on the door, for it to be the least minimally effective.Something tells me if the Mgmt. &/or Security Teams goes overboard with this new procedure, then it could windup irritating a number of their Guests whereas, they might elect to travel & stay elsewhere (upon future trips) instead. So let's just hope a few common sense procedures are applied."
"It already started. At the Flamingo 2 weeks ago, I received two visits from the maids during the early afternoon with my DO NOT DISTURB keyset in place. One walked in on me at a very awkward timeLike earlier suggested, if you are in your room , use the metal latch. And of course, your valuable should always be in the safe"
"Hmm; I do wonder whether a ""Security Room Check Fee"" could potentially be arriving upon the horizon to help offset the additional security costs associated with the room check procedure(s)?"
"""Caesars security staff will enter rooms that have “Room Occupied” signs on them if they haven’t been serviced in a day by housekeeping""So, if you get housekeeping in every day (which suits me fine), nothing changes apparently. Clearly, your reduced fees for no housekeeping will come at a privacy cost.I think the really easy solution would be to put CCTVs and motion detectors in all rooms and bathrooms so they can check on us throughout the 24 hour period. Surely nobody could object to that?Edited: 2 years ago "
"This is all about nothing.It's typical of companies and organizations over reacting to one incident. Companies do this all the time. They have one failure of something in a million or a billion actions, and so they install a 100% inspection of something to prevent it. It will not happen again but 50 years later they are still wasting time and money inspecting that thing and never, ever remove that needless and probably ridiculous inspection.Just adds unnecessary cost that then gets passed on to the consumer and does nothing for them."
"baseballdc makes an interesting point...maybe hotels will add 'enhanced security features' to the list of items included in resort fees. With an accompanying increase in those RF, of course."
"I’m currently staying at Bally’s and did hear security knock at a few doors but did not visit mine yet. Bally’s did send me an email stating if I opted out of daily housekeeping, I would be given $10 per night in food/beverage credit. I did so and earned $20. Doesn’t mean security won’t be around so I imagine they will be there later today or tomorrow."
"""Your Honor, we did everything possible to prevent this from happening including........""Business now takes any action needed to be able to make that statement in court. This is the world we live in. Be thankful that hotels don't run background checks on prospective guests. After all, in many cases they are being held legally responsible for the actions of those guests."
"So people don’t trust the housekeepers not to steal yet you want the hotel to trust you.Honestly, I wouldn’t be shocked if housekeepers already poke their head in anyway.If you’re that concerned, lock up all valuables."
"In actuality, this room security check measure could potentially windup opening up a huge can of worms &/or could backfire.Sooner or later, there'll be someone crafty enough posing &/or dressed as a Hotel Security Officer announcing they're performing a room security check. This could place hotel guests in a rather awkward or compromising situation whereas, the person(s) could potentially windup being sexually assaulted, mugged, hurt, &/or robbed once that person enters the room, even if their security dress & credentials appears highly legitimate &/or realistic in form. They'll done accomplished their evil act & long left the premises before the crime has been reported.Let's just hope this doesn't begin occurring; yet time will tell."
"I think this is knee jerk reaction and not well thought out, these are multimillion dollar corporations that are leaving themselves open to all kinds of issues including theft, I am not saying all hotel employees are thieves, and I certainly hope they are not expecting any of this “security” to be handled by housekeeping, they certainly are not paid enough to potentially be responsible if another nut case plans to inflict harm....this just leaves me with an uneasy feeling"

"Chivas, my arms are always bare in Vegas. Gotta catch them rays : )"
"Bear arms, lol grrrr."
"Actually, it got me thinking (a rare thing, I know) but do you think someone made a typo in the constitution and all these years it's been incorrectly interpreted as 'a right to bear arms' when it should have been 'a right to bare arms'? ; )"
"Or maybe it just meant you were allowed to have really hairy arms, like a Bear! This would explain why Canadians don't have that right because they already have a lot of bears!"
"It only makes me feel safe if they’re checking all closets, under the bed and in the shower for automatic weapons."
Exactly. I'm guessing it'll be a head pop around the door. Only way this can work is checking in all wardrobes etc.
"Actually, it got me thinking (a rare thing, I know) but do you think someone made a typo in the constitution and all these years it's been incorrectly interpreted as 'a right to bear arms' when it should have been 'a right to bare arms'? ; )<,Right you are!!In 1812 Congress was about to pass an amendment to correct the oversight. Before it could be voted upon, your people invaded and burned down Washington along with this amendment. Only later we learned it was a conspiracy of UK time travelers....There was no way British Air was going to pony up to long sleeve shirts for people they lost luggage for"
"“Sooner or later, there'll be someone crafty enough posing &/or dressed as a Hotel Security Officer announcing they're performing a room security check. ”Why aren’t crafty criminals already doing this? This whole topic is absurd. It’s not your house. It’s Caesar’s property. They’re going to stick their head in and make sure everything is good. It beats waiting 3 days and finding a smelly body on the floor or anything else out of the norm. The only weird thing going on here are the oddballs that are too paranoid to let the housekeeper do her job."
Oddballs? Maybe they're just tidy people and feel they don't need a housekeeper every day! I personally prefer the bed covers when they're not all tucked in.
I will be exercising my right to an open robe.
""" It beats waiting 3 days and finding a smelly body on the floor""Oh yes, that must be it. I thought I saw a report of the recent rash of 3 day old smelly bodies on the floor at Caesars properties."
"LOL @ Slade.I mean, I don't really care about this too much. I'm just not sure what it's supposed to do as far as security goes. Are they going to be going through all of your bags? If not, then how would they know if someone had weapons anyway?"
I didn't know there was an epidemic of 3 day old dead bodies in Las Vegas(Although some of my hangovers there lasted that long)I prefer my privacy during my weekends there and see this as an intrusion.
"Count me in the group who prefers no housekeeping. I keep the room pretty tidy, so I’d rather not have them do the work and move to another room. And the security check now makes me anxious (thanks to whomever posted about security raping and robbing people)...I wonder how long it will take MGM or others to join in."
"Yes. The times we have opted out of housekeeping, I just asked a housekeeper for towels and toiletries. They'll usually give you more than enough."
I always put do not disturb.I don't want anyone walking into my room.I throw out my trash daily.I grab extra towels etc off the carts in the hallway.And recently they give you 10/night dining credit to opt out of housekeeping. Win Win for me.
"I'm often in my room working on something (my latest book, sports bets) when housekeeping comes around. I tell them to come in and do what they have to do; I tip them right there face-to-face when they're done. Sometimes I'll engage them in conversation. You get a different perspective on Vegas (and life) when you talk to the cleaning lady."
I just hope they don't come barging into my hotel room when I'm in the middle of cooking rice and boiling eggs.
How much should I tip the security guy who checks my DND room?
"Excalibur did a welfare check daily (DND or not)... it was like a register if you didn't use housekeeping, they'd check you weren't up to no good. Frustratingly we didn't mind housekeeping coming, just not 1pm as that was sleep time and they're supposed to be 24/7.Edited: 2 years ago "
"""How much should I tip the security guy who checks my DND room?""If there's nothing of concern in the room, no tip should be needed. If you're running a meth lab and want them to look the other way, I'd suggest $20."
"Interesting. I think this now public policy may have been an internal policy as when I was there in January, I saw housekeeping more on that trip than I ever have. The housekeeper made up our room mid morning while we were out, but we got a knock at our door every evening around 4-5pm as we were getting ready for our evening. Asking us if we wanted more towels. Didn't think much of it at the time, but maybe they're paying more attention now."
"Let's see now.....I had up my DND sign and I left $5000 on my desk, and now it's missing. Has anyone come into my room ? I want to see the logs of anyone who might have entered my room and I want them arrested !"
"""How much should I tip the security guy who checks my DND room?"" - LOLJust leave all your change with a note asking them to split it with the maid you didnt use ;-)"
"lol, leedy!"
