"Hi all, any advice is appreciated.I'm a UK citizen and my wife is American, both living in the UK permanently. My wife's sister is getting married in August...so obviously it's important to us that we try to attend.Does anyone have any idea on whether this is possible. I would need an ESTA whilst my wife has her US passport.I imagine it might be trickier for me. But does anyone know if we would be able to visit the US for a week in August before returning to the UK?I appreciate things will change in the 2 months, but we've really struggled to find any info on what is even currently allowed.Thanks in advance!"
Just to add... We have found flights that available on the dates we want...so getting that wouldn't be the tricky part...it's more what is and isn't allowed from the UK and US governments.

"No one knows the answer to you question. No one has any knowledge what either government will do and what restrictions will be lifted. For me it’s a bit of a lottery if you buy a flight know or not. If you book flights and they are cancelled you’ll be entitled to a refund as you are covered by EC261 rules but refunds are taking a long time. If the flight goes but there are still FCO advisories or restrictions on entry to US you could loose money or have to accept a voucher. As airlines are just gearing up to fly again and there could be many schedule changes. Pay by credit card for Section 75 protection. Look at the Gov.uk web site, easy to find the information you need which is correct for the present.https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-adviceIf you book flights, book direct with the airline as it’s much simpler to deal with them for refunds, reschedules, vouchers etc. Good luck there are no easy answers."
"Immediate family members of US citizens are permitted to travel to the USA however you cannot currently do so just with an ESTA, your ESTA will be automatically revoked if you check in for a flight. Speak with the embassy and find out what additional documentation you need.Currently there is a requirement to quarantine on your return to the UK which may not be the case in August.FCO advisories should be updated in the coming days for European countries and some international ones so keep an eye out for that. The key bit is if your insurance allows you to travel against FCO advice and what cover they will provide currently.I personally wouldn’t travel to the USA unless I had $5mil+ medical coverage for any cause including COVID-19."
"The 14 days quarantine is only a recommendation at this time. The US does not have facility to enforce this recommendation, unlike some other countries."
"Travel medical insurance will be your biggest hurdle after you work out if you can enter the US. Followed by any quarantines, some states have them, some do not. Going for a week does not work well with a 14 day quarantine."
