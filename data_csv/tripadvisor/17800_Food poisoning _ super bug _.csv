A friend of mine just returned from Ensenachos. She has been there 4 times in just the last year. Apparently there is some kind of super bug going on there that they need to clean up. A lot of people sick etc. It was surprising to say the least.
Is there an on-line reference or news story?
"Careful to blame hotel...I was sick one year(first time ever) it started the first night with one in our group then it went to everyone hitting me my last day. Not a pretty sight. No way it could be the hotel because the first person who got it came down with it the first night(we arrived at 4pm) and all they had for supper was fries. We had one sick person in Club, sick enough that the flight crew asked this person to wear a mask, which he did. All it takes is one person to have a bug on a flight to spread it to everyone else. It takes a few day for it to get started but when it does BAM!!! Helping things along, shared use of serving utensils in buffets.Hope your friend is feeling better.Edited: 6 years ago "
"You say a food poisioning/super bug in the title and reference super bug in the text? Can you give more specifics as the two are completely different. I am not doubting that you friend got sick, I ditto what Sunlover says above about being quick to blame the resort. I have heard a lot of people saying they got food poisoning just because the threw up which is not truly food poisioning. Some people also go all out eating the fresh fruit however when home they don't eat it as much....then the tummy gets upset because whoa boy check out all the fruit we injested. In anycase I will certainly check out the conditions when I am there in 2 weeks....."
We are going to be there Nov 30 - Dec 6 . Where can we get any information . Should we be concerned ?
I have followed up with my contacts as well as with friends who have been there over the last couple of months until now and there is no epidemic going on. The usual odd person getting sick no different then back home. So don't panic.
Your chances of getting sick in a foreign country are indeed higher than if you stay at home.As sunlover said the plane close quarters one person sick look out.As Sue said eating foods perhaps you would not normally eat.You will come into contact with people from all over the world they may not be sick but may carry a bug your immune system has not encountered before.Last but not least too much sun fun party and booze.I have been to Cuba many many times only got sick once and I am quite sure it fell in the too much sun fun and drink category.
And the best part is the OP drops a bomb and then never shows up nice one as at least have the balls to tell people whats happining ....
Maybe they use the PC from work.Just saying.
"I guess the thing that concerned me is this:- My friend has been there 4 times since last February and stays for 2 weeks each time.- She LOVES the place and the people (so do I) so she would have NO reason to make it up.- She really knows the staff very well.I was shocked actually, because it's one place that we can always go and we never have to worry about anything at all - we eat everything, do everything etc. Never an issue."
P.S. I can give you my friends email address if you want to check / cross check details with her? PM me and I'll give it to you.
"Hey Fundy, The dead giveaway at resorts or cruises is when the staff start doing all the food serving â€¦. and hand sanitizers are forced on you at the door to the restaurants. That usually means there's trouble.Here, I guess we are all looking for the news reports or even some reviews that would show a systemic/prolonged problem with the resort or with the food handling for the CSM area.Surely there must be others affected, if your friend caught something exceptional whilst there? If not, maybe your friend picked up a more common travellers bug.Hope she's better now.Edited: 6 years ago "
"SpunkyNB that is exactly what I am thinking. There is absolutely nothing mentioned from other people and as I already mentioned I checked with other people who were there and with staff, but nothing other than the usual traveller's bug. It seems like this is the case here. It can happen to anyone even if you have been to Cuba a hundred times. As the commercial says, ""you never know when it will hit"" ;-)"
"Those are disturbingly funny commercials, LOL"
"@ SpunkyNB...funny indeed unless it happens to you on that long ride from hotel to airport! I can laugh about it now but not at the time. This was before the new buses with bathrooms. Can we get an AMEN for that!!!!!Not saying that the person was not sick, just that chances are it was started somewhere else like mine was.I do hope they are better."
"She brought Rosie back to Canada, who is doing really well. Too bad the resort allegedly poisoned the other dog."
What? If that's true then that is horrible! I know there are resorts in Punta Cana that do this that I have boycotted so if this is true Ensenachos might get added to my list.
"I am sending an email off today to Brenda to confirm a few things. One of the main reasons we selected this resort is because we are animal lovers, and enjoyed the company of Rosy and her little friend."
I was there for 2 weeks in November with a girlfriend she was sick from day 2 on. Also one of the staff members had the same bug. He did not get from the plane. We also spoke with lots of other guests and they had the same issues.
"Now...we are planning to return to this resort and we already recommended this to 2 other couples who will be travelling with us.This information about the bug should be taken with caution...but again - if people are getting sick - then there might be something going on.About Rosie's friend - are there confirmation/facts that the dog was poisoned????? I am a huge animal lover (also work for a vet pharmacy)Again, even if you email the management - they will never spill the truth... even if the dog was poisoned! I am keeping an eye on this thread...."
"I am a huge animal lover also, and heavily involved in advocacy. I have corresponded with Brenda MANY times over the past couple of years, and now she won't reply to my inquiries regarding the poisoning. I do believe what the ladies told me about Rosie's male friend, and now that Brenda won't confirm, it makes me think that it is true. For that reason I will NEVER go back; just like I won't do the catamaran trip because it's the same business doing the dolphin shows."
""" For that reason I will NEVER go back""Well, you might want to just avoid Cuba altogether, as most resorts dispose of unwanted animals in a similar manner. If they are discreet, the guests never see it. Unfortunately this is a problem that isn't likely going away as long as guests entice strays to stick around by befriending them and feeding them."
"Shall I post the email I received from Brenda nearly a year ago saying how much she loved the animals and how she would never let anything happen to them etc ? This 'issue/poisoning' took place on her watch, so maybe she was just lying and trying to tell me what I wanted to hear? Another reason to not go back; shady resort manager."
"eeeefarm knows. We may turn our heads and pretend we don't know but the resorts kill off the strays. In Canada we call the dog catcher and they do it for us and in our north there are ""Dog Shoot"" weeks to reduce the populations. Pet rescue and SPCA and re-homing can only handle a small percentage.The Spanky Project, at the very least, reduces the number of killings."
"""This 'issue/poisoning' took place on her watch, so maybe she was just lying and trying to tell me what I wanted to hear?""First of all, you have given no proof of what happened. Secondly, it may not have been her decision, and it is possible she didn't know about it. Managers come and go. Some resorts have regular animal control and some likely don't. Someone may have removed the dog, or the dog may have been disposed of, but I think it's a little unfair to accuse someone without any proof and without them having an equal opportunity to respond."
"The other thing is the Managers usually don't run the whole resort. For instance managers for Spanish Operators like Melia look after the front end and promotions. Many of the other services at their hotels like housekeeping, maintenance, laundry, HR, restaurant/food services and, maybe, animal control are the responsibility of their partners and facility owners, the Cubans.Like almost everywhere, the owners of the buildings (Gran Caribe, Gaviotta) look after certain things and the Operators like Melia, Iberostar and Barcelo, for example look after the commercial management.I'd expect the owner's maintenance contracts include the removal of nuisance animals. Has nothing to do with the hotel manager."
"The staff told my friends all of this during a series of multiple trips, and the story has been consistent each and every time. I won't get into the horrific and disturbing details of it all - that won't fix anything. This is why the plan was put in place to get Rosie out of there. Rosie recently immigrated to Canada but prior to that she was taken to a staff members house for safe keeping until her paperwork was ready and vetting complete. Rosie is settling in nicely, and I'm thrilled that the stars all lined up and she was able to get out of there alive, unlike her boyfriend and all of her puppies."

"Post #20 ""I have corresponded with Brenda MANY times over the past couple of years""......considering Brenda started working at the IBE on December 24, 2012 it could not be ""over the past couple of years"" since she hasn't even been at the IBE for a year yet.....unless you are referring to her previous resort on Cayo GuillermoAs for animals on the resort.....virtually none around unless you count the iguanas, birds, fish and little salamanders.And as a follow-up to the subject title there is NO I repeat NO FP/SB going on while I was there which was up to this morning."
