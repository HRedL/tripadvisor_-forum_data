"What's the best gifts to bring along? Examples being Tylenol, feminine products, do they need things like this?"
"Thank you, David, for asking this question: I've been burning to ask it myself for a while now... I only hope people will be more specific this time. :))"
Gifting is not necessary. Tipping in money (CUCs) for good service not to be served.
Please leave the Tylenol and feminine products at home. Donate to a charity in your home town. Tip with CUC's for good service and allow staff to use the money to buy whatever they need or want.You can also do some research on this forum if you don't like my response. This question is asked on the Cuba forum regularly.SS
"Saturn_Sela, can you please tell us more about ""buying what one needs or wants"" in Cuba? Where do I go, who do I ask for? :))"
"OrbitYou are from Toronto, correct?Unless I am misunderstanding your question, I can only respond with ""allow them to buy whatever they need or want"" refers to the Cuban workers who provide services to tourists.SS"

"Leave your gifts at home. If you are staying at a resort hotel the workers there are amongst the best paid people in Cuba, Also many Cubans receive regular payments from their relatives in the United States. The new dollar stores are selling mopeds and washing machines as fast as they can get them in. So much for the poor Cubans."
"Of course, how can we say 'no' if they want to buy what they need or want? :)Then the questions are...1) Can they buy what they need or want (is it available)?2) Can we tip anyone other than the servers, the bartenders and the maids?3) If we can (see #2) ), then under what pretext? E.g. how do I tip a friendly gardener(s) who always tries to start a conversation; how do I tip those friendly entertainers who always seem to be willing to share a drink or two once they are done dancing?4) Should I tip the manager's assistant who I send an e-mail to before I come and she always arranges for the exact same room I stay in? How much?5) Should I tip the General Manager who is also very helpful, friendly and talkative?6) If a saleswoman who works in the resort's shop brings me 5-6 barras de guayaba (3 years in a row, because I asked for it once), and she refuses to accept money, should I bring something for her as a gift?"
"bellagio, I am ""one of the best paid workers in Canada"". Still, I like gifts (not sure about women's hygiene products though) :))Edited: 12:29 pm, January 02, 2020 "
"Thank you all for your input I appreciate it. I always have tipped on my trips but I also usually bring gifts like Blue Jays caps Canada baseball caps and give 4 or 5 of those out. I tip all my maids and servers in CUC daily. But this is my first time to a Royalton. I have been to Cuba and had requests for peanut butter, and even Cheese whiz lol. Thanks again to everyone's input. Cheers."
"@9) -#2, can we tip other than the servers, bartenders, maids...you can tip whoever you want to... those are the only ones I tip"
"The problem is, gifting leads to begging. I have had staff outright ASKED for ""presents"", even though I'd been tipping."
"Pardon my terrible grammar. For some reason, I can't edit my word vomit up there. I have had staff ask for presents, or start hinting broadly (here are 17 photos of my family. it's my birthday tomorrow.)"
"My piece of advice is to always pack 2-3 items which can be gifted away in case an appropriate situation arises. Nothing big, something universally liked, like nice box(es) of chocolate. There is no good chocolate in Cuba at all. Watch out: it melts quickly, put it in the fridge once you are there."
Nobody has ever asked me for presents... Can it depend on the place people go to?
"Ok, I know I always say don't gift...but I might take some chocolates for the maid next vacation, she is really nice to me on the FB page.....ha,ha....where are you Ron."
"I think the last vacation we ever took gifts, which was a few years ago, this server kept asking my husband for his hat...this went on daily, oh, I really like it, wish I had it....well he did get it in the end."
"Hola LoriI feel like ""Google Home""....I'm right here....lol!Yeah, I don't do Facebook. I already have enough Cuban friends, lol!But, I can tell you that I spend way more money on chocolates after Christmas (or Valentine's Day, or Easter, or Mother's Day, or Father's Day, or Halloween) - when they are 1/2 price or less - to take to Cuba. Customs guys already know me - and that what looks like oranges through xray are Terry's balls - and they wave me through without having to open any bags....Ever notice the price of a Toblerone chocolate bar at Duty Free shops at the airport? Nuts.….Who doesn't like chocolate? As Orbit posted @ 15 - it is universally liked...Cheers"
"Hola Mike Guys (non-resort workers) ""working"" the beach at Jibacoa are always asking for clothes, and hats, etc. I am told they can sell them for 4.50 - 5.50 CUC - on the street. Yes, even the used ones. Obviously the ones with some kind of recognizable branding will be of more value.....Cheers"
"I have been outright asked for 'presents' at Los Cactus in Varadero, and have had the birthday/here's my kid thing happen everywhere else...as well as Varadero."
"Same here, Desmei. Lots of birthdays and new babies during March high season in Varadero, LOL."
"They don't ask me for my hat any more. Bit then, it's 18 years old, sweat-stained and starting to get a bit ragged. It says ""Cuba"" on the front of it, so no premium for being a fancy brand, either."
"From a recent alert we learned that Vitamins B6 and B12 plus Tylenol are desperately needed in the fight against the Dengue Fever ""epidemic""."
"When you take little gifts and chocolate, do you have to declare them. Thanks"
"Technically only if they are worth more than 50 CUC.Edited: 12:14 am, January 08, 2020 "
"""Tip with CUC's for good service and allow staff to use the money to buy whatever they need or want.Saturn_Sela @4, absolutely spot on. Examples of things that they might need or want, but where only your CUC tips can help purchase these things in Cuba (and yes, most anything is available in Cuba if you have the money to pay for it):New toiletNew material to re-cover living room furnitureNew ceramic tiles and labour for baño refurbNew metal lattice-work for front terrace securityNew paint for casa, both inside and out New A/C unitNew light fixturesNew poured concrete for front patioNew metal front doorI speak from experience... all of these things are needed for my casa with my wife in Cuba to be installed this year. I'm sure many of the resort worker's casas require the same things from time to time. So tip with CASH for those that deserve it if you want to help make these things possible. Often the things that are really needed won't fit in your suitcase.TerryEdited: 8:27 am, January 08, 2020 "
I wonder if other nationalities are constantly discussing what gifts they are bringing like Canadians....I don't think so.
#13 then doesn't tipping lead to begging?
"Last year in our travels to Moron area and inland, i gave away auto parts and tools, used baseballs along with meds. they were greatly needed imo."
@32 - you just randomly handed out meds as you walked through town or how did that work?
like candy on Halloween..sharing is caring. you should try it
"You should never hand out meds, but since you did, hopefully they were translated into Spanish."
"on your response, Cubans are intelligent, resourceful people.that being said, kindly refrain from giving disinformation on an issue you are clearly not versed in. As for tools, drill bits are very needed as well as metal files and multi meters."
"Are you talking to me....one thing I do know, you should never hand out meds, unless you know the person, or take them to a doctor."
"Medications are better placed in the hands of professionals who can dispense them to those who actually need them. If you don't know the recipient you can't know if they will use them appropriately, and I have seen firsthand that some Cubans will make assumptions about drugs and take more than they should (something like here at home, for that matter), or use them for the wrong condition. Unless there is a Spanish translation they may be guessing about the correct dose and usage, which could be dangerous particularly if they give them to children."
"well, we disagree. as i said, Cubans are resourceful people. as for wrong dosage of Rx, that scenario can happen anywhere. Meds are not available to the average Cuban in the time frame needed IMO. (if you can get into a hospital, take a look around)<-that may change your view...Do what your comfortable with is all i can add."
"There are places short of a hospital where Cubans can be seen and given medication. I've been to several clinics while delivering suitcases of medical supplies for Not Just Tourists, so I know this first hand. I have no problem giving meds to people I know well if I also know they are familiar with the medication."
"""well, we disagree. as i said, Cubans are resourceful people. as for wrong dosage of Rx, that scenario can happen anywhere. Meds are not available to the average Cuban in the time frame needed IMO. (if you can get into a hospital, take a look around)<-that may change your view... Do what your comfortable with is all i can add""sidelinellc @39, you're correct, wrong dosage or application of Rx drugs can happen anywhere, but what you're obviously missing is that the labeling of gifted medications you're handing out willy-nilly to Cubans are in English, and quite easily not understood by average locals... therefore, just an accident just waiting to happen, especially where Cuban children are involved.Hopefully you'll do better than what YOU'RE comfortable with in the future, please and thanks.Terry"
"Same with me eeeefarm, in fact I gave a bunch of ibuprofen and arthritis meds to a clinic in Moron and brought 3 NJT bags to hospitals"
"Also, most Cubans have some level of hypocondri and love to talk about their pains and sicknesses and love to take pills. Lots of them. One of the reason, I suppose, why no meds are available over the counter. They need a prescription to buy everything, including aspirin and Tylenol. So they are in no way used to read labels or think about counter indications and cross effects between meds because they always receive a prescription from a doctor and buy it from a pharmacist, and both will explain how to use the med. Please, don't hand out meds to strangers. Give them to local clinics, the people there will likely give them to those in needs."
"So having been many many times I have to say everyone is correct. They appreciate anything. Cash is best but if you want to grab them things they can't get (tire repair kits for cars and bikes, cutlery, kitchen knives) they will be very appreciative. The other option you have is contacted a local Canadian charity that will provide you with a suite case full of medical supplies for you to take. There is no extra charge to you for the extra baggage and you will have fun delivering it to a local hospital."
"we take fishing line, small lures and hooks for the outdoor guys simply because there is no tackle store and they are hard for the Cubans to find. We always ask what items they can't find or have a hard time getting. Dora the explorer items are always a big hit because of the Spanish/English content. Dvd's and books are greatly appreciated"
"#31 no, it doesn't. A tip is a reward for a job well done. The job isn't well done...no tip. Do you leave tampons on the table at Canadian restaurants?"
"I agree totally, Desmei... spot on. Tipping is an extension of capitalism which rewards those who work hard and want to get ahead. Terry"
Great read. Thank you
"I looked up this thread because I had read that many consumer items were simply not available on the island because of the embargo. If people on this thread are saying we travelers should leave cash and not things, does that mean that there actually are plenty of goods and the only shortage is of money?"
"Bingo! If you have money in Cuba, anything is possible... if not from the tiendas, then from the bolsa negra (black market). Terry"
"Re 49,Unless you have friends or acquaintances that are in need of specific items your probably better off with $$.As many folks have said,* theres almost nothing you cant find in Cuba if you have the $$*."
"To put an exclamation point on that, my wife living there rarely buys anything from the tiendas now... she has the money to buy literally everything she needs from the street and have those things delivered directly to our casa... Cuba's form of Amazon. TerryEdited: 7:44 am, January 18, 2020 "
"* Cuba's form of Amazon*Ha!....good comparison Terry,almost as quick delivery if not quicker. After arriving a week ago found myself in need of some chicken,*viola*, 4-15 kg boxes magically appear, paid a slight premium but hey, I got chicken for 3 months."
"Chris, I did the same over Christmas / New Year's... I had 1 big box of chicken, a 1/3 hind of beef, lobsters, shrimps, ham, eggs, bread, all manners of fruit and vegetables, spaghetti noodles, and a dozen other things I can't even remember all bought from street and delivered directly to our casa. Judi even has women regularly visiting with her at the casa wanting her to buy various new articles of clothing and shoes. My wife lives like a princess when trying on all of those things and posing in front of a mirror before buying... Delenys too, my other little princess. jajaTerry"
Always about you .Yup Me me me me .Johnny C
Had to look... but I just knew that you had said something stupid. I wasn't wrong.Terry
