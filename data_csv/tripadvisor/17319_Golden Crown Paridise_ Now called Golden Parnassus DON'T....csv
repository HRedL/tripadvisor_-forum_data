"I went with my daughter to The Golden Crown Paridise &Spa (Now known as the Golden Parnassus) in Cancun Mexico, as a college graduation present.  I had cared for my mother who was dying of Alzheimers and really didn't have any money but I refinanced the house just for the trip, and since my daughter had worked hard to graduate Suma Cumlauda, I had wanted to reward her for it  And what was suppose to be a dream vacation turned into the vacation from hell! From a rude waiter who thought we didn't tip well enough and treated us poorly, being put in the wrong room because they didn't have what we ordered available, free mini bar that was never restocked after the first day to the worst being robbed and the hotel brushing it under the table. To start we stayed at what was suppose to be an ALL-INCLUSIVE hotel. I left the waiter between $8 to $10 tips a day for our dinner and thought that even though this was an all inclusive that I would be nice and leave extra, only to find out that I was a poor tipper and that unless I left $20 tips that I wasn't worth his time, let alone good service.  The reason we chose an all inclusive is because we wouldn't have to come up with any money if we didn't want to and then be able to save money for presents to bring back or go on an outing if we wanted. Unfortunetly we found out that while going on these outings or even while staying down by the pool we were being robbed the whole time. The people who robbed us were actually pretty smart about it. They only started by taking small things and small amounts of money all week long and that made you question yourself. Because you weren't sure if you were actually misplacing things or had maybe left them at home or if they were actually being taken. But the best was that they never touched our credit cards, only the numbers and the security codes on the back. Then they go on line and charge up a huge total before you no what hit you. In two days they hit me for a few thousand dollars, plus all the over draft fees because this was my debit card as well as my mastercard. The Hotel told me that they new who was in my room and ""Would talk with them!"" Wow what a punishment! And that they would investigate it. This meaning that they would brush it under the rug.  Whie my daughter chose to stay in the room for the rest of the time. I wen to get a drink and started to talk to a few people, only to find out that 3 other people had been robbed that week also and the hotel basicly did the same song and dance with them. This hotel has 5 stars on the front of the building. I beleive that it should show a 1 star instead. And for the record, almost two weeks later I still haven't heard back from the hotel! Trust me, this is not a hotel you would ever want to stay at! "
sorry to hear your trip went badly...hopefully mine will be better in 48 hours....btw do you recommend ASP instead??
"This is terrible to hear! I have some friends coming into town and they always stay there and would be very worried to hear about this. How much money was taken from you? How did they get ahold of your credit cards to copy all of the info and charge thousands of dollars? You are going to raise alot of questions by others on this forum so be prepared to give some more detailed answers.Are there safety deposit boxes in the rooms to look up your cash and credit cards or were you forced to leave them out or carry them around with you? The wait staff recieves a percentage of tips from your all inclusive package but it is still nice to tip ""something extra"". Your comment about them not wanting to serve you unless they got a 20$ dollar tip is quite diheartening as well.Hope you get this resolved!"
"Thank you for your responses so far and in answer to questions, they used a key to get into the safes at the hotel and took all different kinds of things from the room. Toward the end they must not have cared that they took more, because they new we were leaving.The hotel made us hurry up and fill out the report and wouldn't even let us check out our room to find out what had actually been stolen that night.They wanted us to hurry and put a dollar amout in the total lost area with out checking over everything and only gave us 10 minutes to fill out the form.We lost jewelry, perfume, money, clothes, presents purchased, personal items and of course all the items purchased on my credit/debit card on line.I admit I don't know what ASP meants though. Sorry.I would carry a small pouch around and as I ran out of money I would take some from my purse I had in the safe, so no large amount would be taken. Or so I though!Carry all items with you no matter what! That is my best advise."
"This is the third time in three months that a first time poster has posted this sort of thing. I am a regular guest at the GCPS and NEVER in all of my stays has anything like this happened, nor have I heard from guests while I was there that this was happening to anyone. For a fact: I have NEVER seen a waiter, bartender or anyone else try to solicit tips. They are more that willing to serve you, tip or no tip. Yes there are safety deposit boxes in the rooms, whether you use them or not is up to you. I have left money, jewellry and other things out and never had anything go missing. I am not just defending this hotel because I go there often, but I am beginning to believe someone is trying to sabotage the good name of this hotel. to the poster, did you insist on the police being called? Did you insist on a police report? your Credit card company and your home owners insurance policy would require this to investigate these thefts. Who was the manager you spoke to? what did they do to investigate this? they can check records of anyone going into your room by the keycard use. There is a lot more to this than what is being presented. Again, I think someone is trying to give this hotel a bad name. FWIW, I have just booked 4 more weeks at GCPS..I am very satisfied there"
"Sorry to hear about your vacation. That is terrible what happened to you. My friend returned from the Golden Crown Parnassus and had a wonderful time. He didn't have one bad thing to say and is ready to rebook for another visit. Its so crazy how one person can have such a fabulous vacation while another person gets treated so badly. Because of the extreme circumstances you went through, it almost sounds like it was the fault of a certain group of employees whose motive is to do exactly what they did to you--rob people. It might not nesessarily be the hotel itself--however they are employing these people which yes, does make them responsible. As far as the tipping thing--did the waiter actually say to you-""If you don't tip $20, I'm not helping you""? Or are you assuming this from his behavior? I've stayed at AI's before in Cancun and other places and have never had any comment to me about how much or even IF I should tip......although we tip EVERYone when we are at AI's. The maids, waiters/waitresses, bartenders...everyone. Again, sorry to hear about your experience. I hope that the hotel does eventually resolve what they can. If you don't hear back from them--I would keep on them and call them again. Good Luck"
"My husband and I stayed at GCPS earlier this month (it was our 2nd trip to this hotel) We never had any thefts, we even left some money and change out on the table to see if it would be taken. Our cologne and perfume (which is expensive) was left on the bathroom counter all the time and never taken. No clothes were taken. I tend to agree with elmo on this one.....I think someone is trying to sabotage this hotel. I did however, not keep anything in the safe, instead I used a small suitcase and put one of those small locks on it just in case. I know those locks are easily picked, but used it anyway. I never had anything taken out of my suitcase or room. The tipping incident thing also doesn't add up either. Who tips at the beginning of a meal? Usually I go through my whole meal experience and do not tip until I am about to get up from the table and leave. Her story just doesn't make much sense to me.And may I suggest to anyone going on vacation..... Leave your credit/debit cards at home. Take only the one you want to use and keep it on you at all times. "
"Something just doesn't add up in this post. We have stayed at this resort twice & never saw anything remotely resembling this kind of behaviour from any of the waiters. And any of them would have been estatic over a $10 tip. Not one of them have ever been rude or given poor service as a matter of fact it is just the opposite, the service is terrific. I could only see this happening if they themselves were being treated very rudely & I have seen very rude & obnoxious people there as they have had a couple of drinks. So again, I think there is something amiss with this post. I just can't see it happening this way."
"We've never had anything taken, and we stayed there twice. We stayed in the same room. It is odd. I'm wondering what the details are. I've never heard of anyone there being rude. I've never heard of a demand of tips. The only place, I've seen tips demanded, is at the CocoBongo Club."
"There was a post a month or so ago about the same thing happening to a couple; jewelry, cologne, make up were taken, along with money. But I cannot remember what hotel it was, does anyone recall?"
loves...think it was Riu Palace in Playa....just remember him writing to the Riu HQ about it
"thanks, I recall several people sayng the same thing but could not recall which hotel. Seems to be an epidemic! I think the poverty from Wilma has done much of the damage..."
We were there last week. I will say one of our cell phones went missing. I would say it was more likely a guest then a worker. Probably someone on their way out. Just my opinion. The employees never gave me a reason to worry.
"All it takes is one bad person to cause havoc. Sad but true. Whether this story is true or not, it happens, and it happens all over. At the very least, maybe we can all be more careful. It's so easy to get relaxed on vacation! We just got back and had no problems,, but that's not to say it didn't happen. Like I said, just one person............"
"Lets set the record straight: there was a theft problem at GP and it was confirmed by Hipolito(sp?) to me on the phone a few weeks ago. According to him, the problem existed and it is now solved. There have been several posts on this issues as people have mentioned.Nobody is trying to sabotage the hotel. They have had a problem that was verified by the staff and it has been corrected.No, those are not black helicopters in the air and it is safe to take off your tinfoil hat. Dodgegirl, when did you stay at the Golden Parnassus? "
"Thanks Zsa Zsa for recognizing that even though theft may not happen to all, that it does still happen. And Elmo, maybe your friends had a great time, but I can honestly say I DID NOT!!!And as for tipping in the beginning. I never said I tipped rht off the bat. I stayed for 8 days and had gone into one of the restaurants for a second time. The waiter didn't realize that I understood him speaking in spanish to the host and telling him to not seat the stupid american in his section that I was a poor tipper and he did not want me. He then made a point of treating me poorly until I complained to someone and then was polite. As for the breakfast and lunch staff, yes they were very nice. But not the waiter during my dinner. I have always left tips and never not tipped a server. I also have always left around a twenty percent tip and so was shocked to be called cheap. Were there nice workers, yes, but no matter how nice one person can be, it only takes one also to ruin your vacation! I hadn't been on vacation for 18yr because of my mothers illness and had wanted to have a nice time. Not to mention a great time for my daughter who had just finished college. I can assure you that if the hotel had taken care of this in a polite manner, I would not have even bothered to have written this. And to hear that 3 other people had also been robbed during the same week didn't make me feel any better either. As for the report. I made sure to bring home a copy and even my travel agent has it on file. I hope this answers some unanswered questions for those of you who thought this might be untrue, but is very real!"
"If you had a rude waiter, and you knew he was talking about you; why didn't you confront him? I would have. I would have put him in his place. That's too bad about the robbery and the way it was not handled makes it worse. The waiter acted very inappropriately. Maybe he came from the Coco Bongo Club, because he mistreated guests over there, and they wouldn't take him back. That place had some very rude workers, the last time we were there. "
I stayed from May 10th to the 17th of 2006. And thanks duckbilled for clearing up for everyone that this was actually going on. I appreciate it!
"Deniseinindiana thank you for asking that question. I was going to say something to the waiter rht when it happened, but my daughter begged me not to embarrass her, so I waited until we were seated and then said something to someone who would handle it for us."
"Denise, these things do happen. Just be glad it didn't happen to you.Quit insinuating that if anyone ever complains that they are liars. Stuffdoes happen dear."
"Wow, yet another post I can not believe. I’m not saying it’s not true (obviously, have no way of knowing), it’s just shocking…. I’ve been to GCPS/GP twice – it’s the kind of place where people remember your name, and how you like your coffee, and will do everything in their power to please you. We do tip also 99% of the time, there were maybe a few times when I didn’t, grabbing a breakfast or one drink once. Never ever did I see or hear anyone being displeased. Especially treating two women that way?? Wow. No one’s ever been rude to us. I mean, forget rude, they are so nice and attentive, it’s almost eerie  My b/f speaks Spanish OK and we never heard any behind-back comments accept maybe some flattering once. Anyplace in Cancun, were resort jobs are desirable as I understand, why’d someone jeopardize his in such a way? I also left valuables laying around, some in plain sight, nothing ever would come up missing. I do tip the maids really, really well (since they work so hard) and last time bought a bunch of little gifts for them (makeup, hair accessories, etc) at the gift shop. Any regulars (TWOINTHELOU?) talk to management about the theft issue (if there is one). It would be nice for them to post an official statement of any sort at the GP website, etc, addressing the issue – true, not true, what’s being done, etc. I hope that some/any GP managers read TA forum. If YOU ARE ONE OF THEM, please post a response, so the folks are up to date! We’re planning to get down to GP again this December. Not that I’m having second thoughts, just sort of wondering if I should look at El D. Seaside suits instead  Grr. Guess I’ll just watch the threads here at TA. "
"Geee....let's look at this post logically in a few areas.....Dodge always tipped 20%....how did she know what 20% was? I was there in April...don't recall a bunch of prices listed and posted on menus and boards behind the bars.Dodge after a WEEK of being stolen from, not to mention all of the fake charges on her credit (debit) card(s)? that she found out about during her trip? decides to complain at CHECKOUT?Dodge after a week of being stolen from, overtipping,being treated rudely takes her 2ND TRIP TO A RESTAURANT WHERE SHE WAS TOLD TO TIP 20% (once again, 20% based on what?) OR NOT COME BACK, goes back to that restaurant, hears someone in Spanish calling her names, and she says what? NOTHING? Because her daughter said not to?My daughter is only 4, and even though she is not quite old enough to enjoy this fine little resort, she'd have told me to kick that waiter's behind.....probably only after dragging my wife off of what was left of his pummeled body.And I am lost on the credit card/cards thing, Dodge...was it card, or cards? Why didn't you just call the 800 number on the back and tell them to stop all charges in Mexico and get some cash! I mean who travels this way...you find fruadulent charges and do nothing? you didn't transfer the money out of the checking account? And my experience with debit cards is this.....you don't get approvals once the cards have monies set aside to pay approved charges. Did you have 50 checks out against your balance and then took that card on vacation?I guess that financial acumen is not in the forefront for someone who needs to refinance their home to take a trip that might cost $2500.00.......sorry it is harsh, but this is why our government can stop any social security reform....my guess is that this posy will end up on a board in front of Congress to prove that Americans can't handle their own money.Something smells here......."
"Dodgegirl1030,Did you party with blueberry3?"
"I agree with margaritafun21 and rclark31. Some people think its wrong to question what someone posts. However certain things do not add up - debit card etc.I think two is there now, and Easy will be soon. several people have just returned and had a great time. I never saw anyone looking for a tip, and good point about what is 20% of a bill you never see, menu with no prices. I would return today, if possible!"
"Yeah, maybe it's not true. Maybe blueberry and dodgegirl, and Al Capone are all board trolls/friends. "
"Sometimes I wonder how many people think they get money and card numbers stolen from them but what actually happens is that they get drunk, spend it and just don't remember doing it."
"First let me say that I said I tip 20% when I go out to eat at a restaurant and no there was no price posted at this restaurant and so there was no way to know what should be a proper tip because of that. That is why even though it was an all inclusive I left $8 to $10 dollar tips because I still considered this a nice tip being I really didn't have to leave one anyway. I also said the breakfast and lunch servers were nice, just not this waiter. You've never had a bad server before? As for my daughter, she's 22 and doesn't like problems. This was suppose to be her vacation and so I wanted to respect her wish's and didn't say anything to anyone until we sat down and he was rude to us at that time.As for my mastercard Debit card, I didn't know about the charges until I got home and found out about them. I then closed the account instintly. I don't use any regular charge cards, only that card. And as for drinking, because of health problems of my own, it would not have been a drunken moment were I just charged up a bunch of stuff to Moscow!!!!! That's rht Moscow! And I never would have signed a waver saying these charges weren't mine at the bank because they investigate these this. If you look at one of the earlier posting it even said that the hotel confirmed robberies were going on about the time I was down there. Almost sounds to me like someone is trying to post negative things on this site so the hotel doesn't lose it business. If you look through other posts like one from a travel agent from florida. You will note she also had problems when she went to Golden Parnassus.And for the last time, just because it doesn't happen to you doesn't mean it isn't happening!"
rclark31 who's blueberry3 and how would I know them if I didn't know their real name?
And for the individual who commented on my refinancing my home. So glad to hear you have alot of money. But taking care of my mom who was dying wiped me out and I have great pride in the fact that I was willing to take care of my mom even if it meant the loss of money in my house! So I don't see why refinancing my house was a bad thing to do for 1 of 5 kids who took the time to go to college and graduate Suma Cumlauda.
"OK, I can't stay silent on this one any longer. First of all, I think we should all take dodgegirl at her word. If she says she was robbed, given that others have reported the same problem at this hotel, let's believe her. Beyond that, experiences with service, tipping etc. can be very subjective. 10 people could stay at the same resort and interact with the same staff and have no problems, that does not mean the 11th won't have them or might preceive things differently.  Having said that, can I just point out the following:  1) If it is so important to you that your daughter graduated with highest Latin honors, you might have taken the time to learn how to write it: Summa cumlaude (I had to remove the space between the last two words because TA thinks it's a profanity. Sick world.)  2) What am I to make of a woman who pleads poverty but instead of sending her daughter to Cancun for a graduation present (presumably in the company of her friends) insists on going WITH HER for TWICE the cost? What college girl wants to go to Cancun with her middle-aged mother dodge""girl""1030 tagging along?  Bottom line, dodgegirl: I am glad you shared with us what happened to you. However, the overall attitude of your post was: I am a saint and my daughter and I are so much nicer and better than everyone else and this should not have happened to us. If that is the way you express yourself it should not come as a surprise to you that some are reluctant to take your concerns seriously.  We're done here. "
"Dodgegirl1030,So sorry to hear so many bad things happening on your vacation!I would agree they had a few issues with rooms not being up to par after the hurricane,and I'm sure there is some theft from all resorts,But its very hard for me to believe that any of the waitstaff would treat you like this...I never once seen a wait person at this resort expect a tip,they always treated us like special quest weather we tiped or not!!And I'm sure if you reported this person to management,they would be long gone...."
"Ok lets all calm down. I thought this stuff was all over. I had emailed Veronica at GCPS and she replied quickly. She stated that there had been some robberies and that the police were involved and that the management let go alot of staff since they could not determine who was the culprit. They let go maids, room service people, security team etc. that might have come in contact with those rooms/and or worked that shift. Some innocent people lost their jobs. I haven't heard of any new thievery posts since this action was taken. I am going there in 1 week and can't wait to return. I haven't had any staff tell me that I had to tip. It is all inclusive (tips are included) and I don't tip all the time. We do tip the bar staff, maid and umbrella guy at the pool. When we have tipped the staff have even seemed surprised and very appreciative. Dodgegirl, you hit a really bad one. What was his name? I would like to steer clear of him. I am not saying that your experience isn't real..it just hasn't been my GCPS experience. "
"How did you come up with the name Dodgegirl1030?Good luck getting these items removed from your credit card and getting these issues resolved with management,end of subject!"
"This entire thread is a little disheartening. Maybe I am missing something, but there seems to be a lot of questioning of financial and family decisions. Seems to me those are personal choices that each of us are entitled to make. Who goes on a vacation, how it is paid for, and how they deal with rude staff are all very subjective decisions. I don't believe a person should be judged because they: 1) opted to join their daughter (parents often work hard to support their children and deserve a reward to), 2) refinanced to pay for it (maybe not the best choice, but people do what they need to do), and 3) avoided confrontation (trust me you never want to make enemies with people that handle your food).This is a great forum for everyone to share their experiences. If this is a true story, it is clearly ian solated incident as evidenced by the plethora of defenders. If it is true, the post simply had a negative slant, probably because Dodge was greatly dissapointed in something she made a lot of sacrafices for.   "
"I never meant to come off as a goodie-goodie. I just originally wanted to let others know that this could happen to them at this hotel. Wether or not someone chooses to go or not. I thought others should know. But admit that I was angery when I wrote it because of the hotel brushing it under the table.As for why my daughter would go on vacation with me. Originally I was going to send her with her fiance. But because we have always been close and since her new job would take her far away from me, she asked if I would go with her so we could spend some time together before she left.I do hope that those who go back to the hotel have a nice experience.

"Now I'm wondering if guests at this hotel should bring some chain link, or buy it down there, and a pad lock for the safe and luggage. If all this is true, it's very sad the hotel handled it this way. I wonder if Hipolito still comes to this site and reads the comments. He should read them. And invite Pedro Pinhal the GM. And someone should tell the owner this is happening. Dodgegirl, did you see or were you introduced to Hipolito, Pedro Pinhal, or Ellen Rodgers? Ellen has the small desk, next to the front desk, and she handles their public relations. As much as we loved staying at this hotel, I don't think we will go back, until a lot of things change. Mainly the rooms, and the problems have to change for the better; or this hotel is going to lose business. "
"Dodgegirl1030,Which restaurant did this happen at?"
"Just to chime in on the runaway train...what if this poster is not an imposter and everyone has been so rude? If this is blueberry or reallady or whoever then they have serious issues. BUT...what if this is legitimate? The staff at this hotel is admitting theft problems. Does that mean that everyone who goes there gets robbed? No. But to the minority it can happen. I have never stayed there, but I certainly would and remember the info I read and be more careful. I think heads up about things can never hurt. It doesn't mean it WILL happen to you!Just trying to say - it does happen and just cause it didn't happen to you doesn't mean it's a lie."
"Dodgegirl1030--How awful for you to experience all this trouble on a vacation you well deserve with your daughter. Give her my congratulations for all her hard work in school. I feel several of these posters are extremely rude and would seem to go to any extent, even to accuse people of not telling the truth and slandering their name, just to say their resort is best. Carly2000 I truely hope nothing like this bad experience ever happens to you, who could you complain to after making such an issue with Dodge?? You come off with a ""holier than thou"" attitude."
"<--------- Regular here. (visits the Golden every 8 weeks)Going in 2 weeks. June 14-171) If, I say IF, this poster is for real- I two agree it is an ISOLATED incident.2) I spoke to Hipolito and he confirms that there was a problem and several people were let go. Management is WELL aware of this issue and the management that I know (Hipo, Pedro) are NOT the kind to sweep it under the table and do nothing. 3) As many times as I have been, the staff is extremely appreciative for ANY tip they receive. Same service with no tip and I see people not tipping all the time and they are treated with same service/respect. 4) Theft/robbery can happen anywhere and it does- even at the RITZ next door. 5) I love the staff there like they are my family and we have been invited to meet their family's and have dinner at their houses. They are the best group of staff/people anyone could ask for. 6) Why blame the staff when it could have just as easily been another guest?? Relax, go have fun here and don't let one or two negative posts sway your opinion of this home away from home.Susan "
"Oscarthegrouch, you are the one who is not telling the truth.Nowhere in this thread or ever have I said that GCPS is ""the best"". When discussions about the quality and rating of GCPS started about a week ago, I was the one who brought up the fact that Expedia advertises GCPS as a 3.5-star hotel, and I repeated that rating in my previous post on this thread.I have not slandered Dodgegirl1030 in any way. Since she claimed she didn't know who Blueberry3 was, I gave her the background information so she could understand the comments about that poster.I even admitted, ""Since there is no way I can prove it, I am not stating for a fact that you are also the same person."" I also said, ""I don't have any proof to say that you are a liar.""Why do you pick on me? Other posters have openly challenged her story and have told her it is not true.I only hinted at the possibility, but I refused to accuse her of trying to deceive us, because it would not be fair. I limited myself to expressing doubt about some aspects of her story and explaining to her why it is so hard to believe.If it was all true, I am very sorry for her and her daughter. However, knowing that many of the previous employees had been fired in the wake of those theft incidents, it is very hard to believe that any old or new employees would risk losing their jobs too by stealing a few dollars and minor items here and there, when they can apparently make so much money on tips."
"Just a response to previous poster:1. Isolated incident - to a degree - there have been a few others in the past few months and I am sure not everyone is a trip advisor poster so possibly more.2. If management is aware good, but that does mean there really was a problem and therefore, this person is not lying.3. Everyone knows that staff can have a bad day, moment or whatever. Not everyone is always friendly as can be. The nicest person can sometimes be a jerk!To say that sometimes people don't complain in Spanish about someone they don't think understands is not true. We have heard it many times - these ladies who were braiding hair were laughing about the fat american lady they were overcharging. When I responded back they weren't too happy. My husband and I are guilty of doing this when we don't want others to understand us.4. Agreed - it happens all the time everywhere, even at home!5. Just because you have friends there doesn't mean there is a thief in the midst.6. It is obviously the staff when they have to get into the rooms and the safes....and it happens every so often. Unless of course it is you when you travel there every few weeks. JUST KIDDING!"
"dodgegirl1030 I am so so sorry you was treated so badly and someone stole from you and your daughter. If I was you I would be calling the place I booked the trip with and tell them everything! I am also SOOOOOOOOOOooo sorry you was Judged here.. seems that has been going on a lot here. Ive read here for YEARS and its starting to surprise me how some people respond.. If your not in the ""group"" and dont agree with them you tend to get attacked. Again i am sorry you was treated badly on your vacation AND here. Hopefully Tripadvisior will start to see how some ""reg"" AND newbies treat people and start banning some. "
"Angel among us, you have a very good point, but you should never use ""was"" with ""you"". Please say ""you were"", as in ""I am sorry you were treated so badly."""
Carly2000 Sorry I am not very good with spelling and using the words correctly :) but I try :)
"How about we end this and start talking about cancun again so some of us who haven't been can keep recieving info and make our own decisions. I'll be there in 2 weeks. 1st time.And, I don't care if this is correct grammer, a run on sentence, or my adjectives are dangling with my participles. Let us move on. Tell me more about cancun.Hopefully this will be the last thread here. I doubt it though."
One time in Cancun I had a little too much to drink and walked out of my room with my adjective dangling with my participles and hoooweee...!!!!... you should have seen the looks I got...
"One time I was moving pool loungers around. I had 1 over my head, bumped into this guy, and accidently knocked him into the pool. His participles and adjectives were dangling all over. His new wife was laughing her - - - off. "
Tee hee...... :)
Nothing like a little ding-dong humor to break the tension....uh oh....can you say ding-dong on here.....???Ding-dong
Ah well the funnest thing that happened to us ( which may not be funny to you all but was to us) was when me and hubby and friend walked in to a Resutarant and after sitting down noticed the price was way out of our range ( well we could of afforided it i guess but was not paying that much to eat!) I looked at hubby and friend and said... Just get up walk out and dont bring attention to our selves. Well me and hubby did just that!! our friend however got his foot stuck in a chair and the chair flew across the resturant. it was funny to us LOL
It didn't hit anybody in the ding-dong did it....????!!!!Waaa haaaa haaa....!!!......this thread is doomed.....!!!!And probably my posting privileges too....
"OOOOOOOhhhh I got a goodie. On my honeymoon we tried water skiiing. My first time! Anyhow I did get to stand up and ride in. The beach was loaded with people watching and did they get a show! I didn't know it but my bathingsuit top was up around my neck and my ""shoes"" were there for all to see. "
"Sorry...I have toBut how does a debit card get overdrawn thousands of dollars? Simple answer, it cannot. Once your balance is hit, it's over.Leads me here:If all of these bad things happened to you Dodge....why not write up something that holds up to some scrutiny instead of updating almost every aspect of your story as it get picked apart. IMHO......when someone screws me over over, I know the story backwards and forwards and it never changes to suit a new take on it. Why, becuase the truth does not change. If you got ripped off, sad to hear, but next time maybe write something with fewer (read several) holes.But a week's worth of getting nailed like you did down there, I would have thought to see a different reaction while you were at the resort.Is the smell getting worse?"
margaritafun21 my Debit card CAN bounce.. I have over draft I CAN go over my limit BY A LOT . I Just get charged a fee AND have to pay back what I used.Guys dont be so quick to judge someone. you have no idea if this is true OR not true. People have posted that they contacted the resort and things DID happen. 
"I have to agree with some of the others here. I had a great time at GCPS and would never guess that any employee would be upset with a $10 tip. Most looked surprised to see anything. Maybe its the way it was written, but this does sound fishy... I'm sure a restaurant and waiters name, along with a few other details about the trip would quiet some of the nay-sayers, including myself..."
"I personally would love to know which restaurant this incident occured in. Never in all of the times we have stayed there, have I ever encountered either bad service, or hints for tips. We have booked another 4 weeks in January.......would I cancel?.......not on your life"
Hi Elmo:Nice to see you. We usually go in Jan. as well. Would love to meet up and party with you. We are going in 2 weeks to play on the dirty floors with all the ants and thieves. I agree........I wouldn't cancel if you paid me!Susan 
"Hi Susan, say hi to my ""son"" Alphonso, from his Mama Juana. I tried to call him today as it was his day off, but couldn`t get a line out to MX."
"Sure thing elmo! Isn't he the best? Wonder which one will go to the new place Jose/Fonzi?? I'll try and find out from Hipo.What dates are you going in Jan.?Take care,Susan "
"Susan, we will be there from Jan 8th through Feb. 5th. It had better not be fonzie! I told him, and I told Hipolito. Also told Elias, Fonzies boss, he told us that the Tiki was Fonzies bar for as long as he wanted it........"
"Lucky you! I would LOVE to be able to stay for that long. We go often, but can only stay for 3-4 nights (kids, self employed, etc.....)We go in Jan. for hubby's bday on the 4th. Hopefully we will see you there. Party on.............Susan "
"For those interested, the restaurant was the shangri La. I can not remember off the top of my head the waiters name, but beleived him to be spanish not mexican because of his fairer skin color and color of his eyes.And yes you can go over on your debit card that's why some places won't honor debit cards.As for wether this is true or not. You may call Central travel in Toledo Ohio to confirm they have a client who did indeed have problems on this trip. As for answering questions. Not a problem and I was always taught that if the story stays exactly the same word for word that is when you question it. This came from my family who are police officers!!!!!!As for those of you who had a great trip. I am happy for you, but I did not have a grea time.Were there ever times I did. Of course. Helen and the other entertainment staff were great and always had something planned. And for the ten millionth time, the breakfast and lunch waiters were nice. But again you can't tell me you've never had a bad waiter before.And thank you to all of you who cared enough to be kind and understand."
"Do you remember if Elpidio was the manager at the Shangri La? He used to be. If he knew 1 of his waiters was out of line, he would have been very upset. Elpidio is a darker skinned man, and he's very nice. He has a thick head, of black hair, and he's around 39 years old. The only person, that I can honestly say was not smiling on our last trip was Arturo. He was the manager of the Old Barn. And he ran around so much with all of his wait staff, that he was probably just too hot. I can't think of anyone who was actually rude, during dinner times. Maybe the Shangri La had some of their regular staff leave, and this was a new guy, from somewhere else. Dodgegirl, did you get to speak with Hipolito, Pedro Pinhal, or Ellen Rodgers at the resort? They are all management. "
She already said she couldn't recall the names. 
"This reminds me of another topic about Joe's jeep adventure being a waste of money, dodge you should have seen how they crucified the author for that topic, and it was revealed by Joe himself that the lady was telling the truth.""Hi Susan, say hi to my ""son"" Alphonso, from his Mama Juana. I tried to call him today as it was his day off, but couldn’t get a line out to MX""You see dodge from the remark above how loyal some of these characters in here are to a certain resorts and I feel it's this type of loyalty that clouds there judgment, I myself would like to thank you for sharing your experience with us. Sorry you had negative experience but hey it happens. After 100's and 100's of wonderful reviews about Golden Parnassus, we find out it isn’t so GOLDEN after all."
"Hi DodgegirlI can't tell you how amazed I was at reading your account. I used to be a regular contributor to the board but have not had the time recently but since we are going back to the GP at the end of June I thought I'd bring myself up to date with what is happening.We have stayed at the GCPS about 11 times over the past 3 years and my daughter spent a year working there as time out from university. Never have I seen, heard or even suspected anything like the expeiences you encountered. I have left money, valuables etc. in my room, at the front desk, by the pool - in fact all over the place and it has always been perfectly safe. The waiters have never even hinted at a tip let alone demanded one. However, it is always possible that a rotten apple gets into the barrel and the only way to deal with it is to see the bosses. I would suggest you contact:1. Pedro (the hotel general manager)2. Hippolito (the hotel manager)3. Ellen (the PR manager)4. Elpedio (the catering manager)Each and every one of them I know personally and can vouch that they would be appalled if they thought a thief was in their employment and that a guest expeienced as unhappy a time as yourself. As for your assumption that the hotel would ""brush it under the rug"", unfortunately there are people who make fictitious claims and so an investigation based upon evidence is necessary before any disciplinary action can be taken. That is not to say that your experiences weren't real, merely that due process must be followed before the hotel can proceed.Homesick"
"Dodgegirl1030,Have you stayed at any other resorts in the Cancun area that you would recommend?"
"Homesick,Say hi to Kati for us,missed her at gcps this year,hope shes doing great with her studies!"
"Hi clarkcThanks for the best wishes for Kati. She didn't get back to University (too late with the application for this year) so she's been working for an international recruiting company. However, she still has the Cacnun bug in her and is thinking of going back before starting Uni. next year. Whatever she does though I'm sure she will have fun.Homesick"
"Clarkc, no I haven't stayed at any other hotels in Cancun so I couldn't tell you about any other places. And my travel agent has asked me to let them deal with the other travel agencies and hotel being that there were actually 2 other travel agencies invovled with the booking."
"Dodgegirl1030,Goodluck to you!Maybe the people are more desperate since the Wilma...It's a good lesson for all of us,to be ware of are surroundings when we're traveling..."

"Oh...you remember the waiter's skin tone and eye color....must have missed the NAMETAG near his headalso, how could you not know the name of the person who upset you the most on your trip from hell......and who doesn't honor debit cards, since they work like a visa?unless you were down there enterning pin numbersi could go on...but this just gets sillier by the minute....don't respond dodge, it will tempt me too much and i need a breakis it just me...or do those who seem to have the most trouble on a trip............. "
Is there not anyone but myself that recognizes this is a troll posting? There are too many POSITIVE things said about the resort in the past for this to be going on now.....
"Margarita I'm glad to hear your a big fan of Golden Parnassus. And again if you want to varify my story contact Central travel in Toledo Ohio. I won't justify myself to you anymore. Post away, but as someone else said. The day it happens to you it may not be as far fetched as you thought."
I have to ask..... DODGEGIRLWhat is the connection with you and Central Travel?Are you looking for a full refund on your vacation? 
"Gocolt that's a good question and the answer is no I do not want a refund, only that the people who did this to me be caught and punished and the hotel at least admit that yes this was done to me and apologize. I really don't think that this is to much to ask.Margarita was just saying that it couldn't be true and I was giving the girl info so that she could confirm it since the posts from others saying that the hotel was being robbed wasn't enough.But thank you for asking and you have a good night Gocolt."
"This will be my last post to this site but just wanted to thank all who took the time to visit and respond good or bad.I also wanted to say that for the person commenting on my excitement for my daughter and not spelling the latin high honors word rht. Now you know why I was excited. I never went to college and I have two older sons who didn't either. Hopefully my two younger ones will go, but for me this was a big accomplishment in our household. Also don't worry, my boy's would never want to go on a trip with their mom either, they would rather be with their friends. Just my daughter wanted to go on vacation with me.I may have left some of you with still unanswered questions and others who may never believe. But I know in my heart that this did happen and that's good enough for me. Wether you go or don't go hopefully you know that people aren't just taking credit cards. They got smart and are only writing down the numbers and the security code from the back of the card so you don't know it's missing until it's to late. And that in two day's time they can do a lot of charging up of debts on line where it's not verified. As for me, I think my next trip will be in the States just to be on the safe side.Hope you all have enjoyable and safe vacations!Sincerely, Dodgegirl1030"
"Dodgegirl---It is a shame you have to explain yourself and be crucified here on this board for simply informing us of your misfortunes on your deserved vacation. You do noytowe explanations to anyone here, no one needs to know all of your personal business here ( room #, what kind of credit card, why you went with your daughter , what was everyones name, where did you file your report, why did you refinance your home, why don't you learn how to spell better, etc.). Everyone here should be ashamed of themselves! This is America not some communist country. Everyone has a right to state their bad experience without being interrogated."
"Also, Dodgegirl, I went to college and I still spell words wrong at times. Everyone gets use to spell check and without it many of us make mistakes. So don't feel bad. It would be nice if they had spell check on here."
"dodgegirl,Thank you for your post. I also want to thank you for handling some of the previous harsh responses so well. I doubt I could have done the same. To margarita:""Oh...you remember the waiter's skin tone and eye color....must have missed the NAMETAG near his head""- I can remember faces like few others. I very rarely forget a face of someone I have met, although I frequently forget names. It is not uncommon for me to meet someone very memorable yet forget his or her name 1minute later....so it could have nothing to do with ""missing the NAMETAG"".""and who doesn't honor debit cards, since they work like a visa?""-Why don't you do a little research of your own to answer this question. dodgegirl is not the authority on ""who doesn't honor debit cards"" nor should she hold the burden of proof to answer this. Besides, you have already had your apparent truth ""But how does a debit card get overdrawn thousands of dollars? Simple answer, it cannot. Once your balance is hit, it's over."" proven a the opposite, so this followup question seems like desperate attempt to save face.Just some thoughts here. I just have a hard time when honest people get unjustly and rudely grilled by those who don't like being wrong."
"Oscarthegrouch,I see that you also love Adventura spa palace along with blueberry3 and reallady.Go figure!"
"Not leaving the states for vacation in no way protects you from credit card fraud, theft, rudeness. This has been on several threads, but a good reminder to all when traveling, let your credit card company know your dates of travel. Make sure your credit card/debit card company has some fraud checks in place. Most companies will call you if your charges are not in your norm, $ amount, internet orders etc."
"Am not aloud to decide to visit a certain resort? Why don't you just attack me now??I have never been to Aventura, we are going in June. We heard many good things about it from Nanasal. It seems like a perfect fit for me and my wife. We are allowed to go to the resort of our choosing, as are you, without someone challenging you. I am sure I will try many other resorts in the future. This will be our first time in Cancun and we plan to enjoy it. We will also take a day to explore the hotel zone and ""My Place"" as Zsa Zsa has highly recommened it. "
Good suggestion 4penquins.
"I have to chime in. I'm truly sorry for the rude responses Dodgegirl. Kudos to Penny for good notes on travelling with credit cards. One thing I would add: most car rental companies do NOT honor debit cards because they cannot put a ""hold"" on part of your balance the same way they can on hold credit lines. Make sure you have one credit card available for car rental that has a much larger balance than the actual car rental cost so that the car rental company can ""hold"" part of that against your rental. It will be released 24 hours after your return of the car. If anyone wants to argue with this point, just call the rental car companies or search their FAQ section of their websites. It's in the fine print for all of them. Theft happens in every place at every level of service. There will always be bad people who are able to scam their way through the hiring practices of every company - internationally. Why would anyone on earth believe it isn't possible? Everyone needs to take reasonable precautions against theft - don't take your fancy j ewelry where you will not be wearing it at all times. Don't take more cash or credit cards than you need. Call your credit card company and tell them where you are going on vacation and how long and tell them that if anything unusual comes in, it is denied until voice approval from you is received. It's a tad more inconvenient but not beyond reason. Many people on here are very happy with the resorts they have visited over the years. We are all passionate about our loves. We need to remember that everyone sees things differently. What may be charming to one may be a nuisance to others. What may be endearing to one may be just painful to others. I say this because I just read a recently posted review of Club International. Anyone who reads my posts knows I love the Royal Resorts and Club International best of all. The exact reasons this person hated the resort and panned it are the reasons I absolutely love it. Perspective and relationship really matters in these experiences. So, all in all, peace everyone. Cheryl"
"Oscarthegrouch, you are wrong again.What do you know about communist countries? I lived in Cuba for 35 years and was fired from a full-time teaching position at a university because I dared to dissent and express my opinions.By the way, in communist Cuba we couldn't have an open discussion like this because the Internet is forbidden.As you said, this is America, where the first amendment to the constitution guarantees freedom of expression. Dodgegirl has the right to post whatever she wants on this forum. Likewise, right or wrong, polite or rude, we have every right to interrogate her or anyone who posts suspicious negative opinions about any resort that has consistently gotten positive reviews.As George Orwell wrote, ""If freedom of expression means anything it is the right to tell others what they do not want to hear."""

"Some people are really something else! they are allowed to paise the resorts they like, say all the good things about the resort, but would not allow someoneelse to report their bad experience? I believe all kind of cases exist, 1000 people have good experience and enjoyable vacastion doesn't guarantee 100% satisfaction, by the same toaken, one bad experience should not kill the reputation of the resort, it just give all of us an alert. Those who have good experience with the resort sould come out and defend the resort but should not attack the poster for reporting their case. "
"I still say there is no need for being rude, or viscious here, Carly. If you think Reallady, Blueberry3 & Dodge1030 are the same person, write to TA. They can verify, or not, & suspend priveleges.As for being an educator, I saw the way you slammed someone's grammar, yesterday. I've know a few educators & professionals who came out of Cuba. They would not think of treating others the way you do, in the name of freedom of speech.Aren't you one of the ones who used to berate Poppa for correcting grammar? Come to think of it, he's published & is a film maker. You didn't believe that either, but it's fact. Who's trying to take the high, moral ground now?Give it a rest. Disagree, or not. Stop the character assassinations."
"To Marg-""To Jet.....I would remember the waiter's name, skin tone, hair color, moles, scars, and rings if someone insulted me to the point that Dodge claims...but then again.....also, saving face is not my reasoning (if I even understand why you stated that)....I have no credit cards and travel with debit cards for the sole reason that they are convenient and you can set the limit by limiting the amount of funds avalailabe...but that is me......and how can you make the statement that ""honest people get grilled.....you don't know me or Dodge....why am I not honest?......that says more about how you think than you know......""- It is clear that you would remember the waiters' name along with all the other details. My point was that I, like dodge and many others, do not have a memory for names and it is not at all unlikely that a person could forget or not take note of a memorable person's name. With this in mind, it seems a stretch to consider dodge's story to be ""sillier by the minute"" do to such petty personal differences in memory. Also, I have no reason to believe you are not honest just as I have no reason to believe dodge to be the same. And I'm not sure what point your last statement makes since virtually everything you have spoken to thus far has been little more than a display of ""how you think."""

"Aq700, you picked on the wrong guy.First, I never corrected Poppa's grammar, either in English or Spanish. I just rebutted some of his attempts to impose his moral standards on all of us.Second, I was very polite when I corrected that poster's grammar earlier today. I acknowledged that she had a very good point and used the word ""please"". I never criticized her as a person, only the specific grammar mistake she had made. Other than that her grammar was perfect. As an ESOL teacher I have the moral duty of helping people improve their English skills, even if no one is paying me to do so.I do agree that we do not need to be rude with anyone."
"First let me be up front and say that ""yes I am going to ASP in June."" It's a gift from my Parents who are Palace members, and no I have never stayed at GCPS, or ASP for that matter.I have managed 4 diamond/star golf resorts here in the Southwest for 17 years, and sad to say but these types of things have happened at every property I've come across. More often that not it has been a front line employee, rather than a housekeeper who was responsible for the credit card issues, the safes, and the missing items in rooms. The simple reason being is that they have so much more access to ones rooms than anyone else on the property. I'm speaking of front desk, bellman, and other members of management. It happens more than people think. The degrees of which it happens also depends on the guests themselves. One suggestion I have, is to leave your valuables in the hotels security box, rather than the one in the room. Have someone (hotel staff) verfiy what you place in the box. Leaving money out in the room is often times thought of as a tip for the housekeepers. Remeber that there are people who will tip over $20.00 even to maids. So don't be surprised if its not their when you return.One last thing, you can request to have your room cleaned at a specific time. Take your valuable with you for that hour, and when you return place the DND sign outside your room door. This will help eliminate unwanted traffice in your room. Hope this helps.."
