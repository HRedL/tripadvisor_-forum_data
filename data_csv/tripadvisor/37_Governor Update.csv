"No new casesNo hospitalizationsCapacity to treat covid patients has expandedNo new booking until May 15th at the earliest, possibly June 1st. They want to be able to test every person landing at the airport before they reopen bookings. I got the impression that June 1st would be the latest, but I could be wrong.State of emergency will be extended to June 12th, needs to be passed by legislatureCould they really test everyone coming through the airport?? They can’t even test people right now who might have it! Blood tests? Nasal swab? Sounds like a pretty big delay. But a great idea if it’s feasible."
"From today's press conference? It's not up on www.vi.gov yet.Cheers, RickG"
Correct Rick
"They have tests, but just like many places in States, they need swabs.Last I heard they were doing voluntary temperature screening at the airport.Edited: 5:44 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"""They have tests, but just like many places in States, they need swabs."" Well that's a fat lot of good."
They won't be out of swabs forever.
"I wonder if they misspoke when they say they want to ""test"" every arriving passenger. Perhaps they meant ""screen"" for temperature and symptoms? Either that, or they are talking without really understanding the implications of what they are saying.The reason I ask is that when you do the math on actually testing every arriving passenger the utter impossibility -- or at least insurmountable impracticality -- of the task quickly becomes apparent. Even with the availability of the ""rapid"" test from Abbott Labs.According to the Abbott press release, their new COVID 19 rapid test platform can reduce time to results ""to as little as 5 minutes for positive results and 13 minutes for negative results.""So you're really looking at a test that is ""as short as 13 minutes"" to find out whether the person tested is actually negative... which is what you're looking for. (So the five-minute test time is meaningless unless you're assuming everyone on the plane is infected.)Just to make the math easy, let's add a minute up front for sample collection, thirteen minutes for each test, and a minute to clean the machine to prep for the next test. And keep in mind that the machine can only process ONE TEST at a time.Let's assume that a typical commercial flight into St Thomas or St Croix holds 200 passengers.If every arrival gate at each USVI airport has a machine, at 15 minutes per passenger, we're looking at 3,000 minutes to screen every passenger deplaning a single commercial flight.Yes... that's 50 HOURS of testing time to deplane a SINGLE flight.Crazy, right? OK...Let's assume there are TWO machines at each gate. Only 25 hours to screen everyone.Four machines? Still gonna take 12 and a half hours to deplane a single flight. 8 machines? Now we're down to just over six hours of screening time to deplane just ONE flight. Let's go crazy and assume there are SIXTEEN machines at every gate.. We're now down to adding ONLY three hours of screening time to deplane a single flight. Wanna get that down to an hour and half of screening for a single flight? You'll need THIRTY TWO machines. At every gate.Consider what that means for STT airport: according to Wikipedia STT sees 1,4 Million passenger arrivals a yea, which is ~3,900 a day passenger a day. That'd mean 58,000 extra minutes a day, every day, to test every passenger. That's roughly 975 HOURS of testing time a day. If you were willing to accept an additional 2hrs net screening time to clear every inbound flight St Thomas airport, that volume of passengers would require 487 testing machines running 24hrs a day. But since flights into STT aren't spread evenly throughout the 24hr day, you'd actually need more like 700-800 screening machines running between say 8am and 10pm. (Knowing that during peak hours, the screening lines might bulge to 4-5hrs.) Plus... where will St Thomas find the 700-1,000 trained/qualified healthcare workers to collect the samples, process the tests, etc?Sure when you say ""test every person landing"" that sounds simple enough.But when you look at the details and do the math involved, you realize that this is an entirely impractical idea.Edited: 6:25 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"I work in healthcare in Mass and you can’t get a test unless you are symptomatic and the rapid point of care testing is only for healthcare workers and first responders right now. Also the testing has only a 75% accuracy rate, that’s all testing be, it rapid or not, which is not reassuring. I also don’t get the checking people’s temp thing to screen as by the time you have a temp you have already been contagious for the last 12 days with the most shedding of the virus on days 13 and 14 then symptoms appear."
I'm sure he meant to say taking temperatures of incoming passengers and not testing - at least that is what has been said in the past.
So what happens if 195 passengers on that plane test negative and 5 passengers test positive ? Then what ?
"PIa- I was assuming the same thing except he said test a couple times and said that it may take til June 1st to have the testing in place. I would think they have the resources right now to take temperatures? Maybe need more people if there’s going to more/full planes. And taking temperatures isn’t going to protect us, I think a huge majority have no symptoms based on the antibody tests. IMO..."
