"Hi guys.Just wondering if there are any Australians in Laos at the moment. I think it might be good to keep in touch, so if we hear anything about leaving, we can share. We are currently in VIENTIANE, and are in contact with Embassy and Smartraveler and registered with all.Let us know what you are up to or if you are following any sources that may be helpful.Stay safe everyone."
"Sure, but why would you want to leave?"
"Obviously due to CV epidemic. Plus I live and work in Australia and my family is there, so I need to get back."
"""Obviously due to CV epidemic.""To be honest I think you are better off here. Also there appears to be no way to get to Australia now from Lao."
"Hi. Check out, “now in laos” YouTube channel. Ozzie ex pat living in Vientiane. Seems like a decent guy who has all the info."
