"Social distancing and hygiene are the only weapons we have to slow the COVID-19 contagion rate and shorten the duration of the pandemic. There are no effective antivirals. No vaccine now. ""Testing"" just helps know who to isolate and if they are sick, to get the intubation kit ready. Look at New Rochelle NY. Two people came back from a trip to their town of 79,000 and there are now 104 confirmed cases.https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/new-…Air travel does not fit into SOCIAL DISTANCING any more than mass gatherings.

"Hi, I was supposed to vacation to DC in 7 days for a wonderful 4 day weekend, but i feel this is not a great time to travel. It was for a casual but very meaningful weekend away, but my brain is saying this is not the best time; DC will always be there; and so will my good friends I was going to visit. Also, DC just had a huge exposure from a rector in a church, as well as DC politicians exposed to it at a convention, who were probably exposing others to it in more D venues. I also woke up feeling sick today with a sore throat, so my body is now compromised. Do you think I am being too silly and cautious for cancelling? I don't want to disappoint my sweet friend and really want to go.. But I feel DC, the plane and hotel will be a petri dish of virus and I won't enjoy myself. It would be easier if the plane company or tripadvisor just cancelled it for me and I wouldn't have to be the bad guy to make the decision, haha. What is your opinion? Am I making the right call?"
Great blog!
I have plans to travel to Spain 3/24-4/1 and Ireland 4/11-4/24.Can anyone advise if this is still possible for an American? I find the information from the Government a bit confusing. Thank you for the help!!
"I'm flying from LAX to London end of this month but I don't have a direct flight. Does anyone know if the Travel ban for Americans flying to the EU include layover flights? I have a short layover in Oslo, Norway which is included on the list of counties banned. Thanks so much! This is such a crazy time to be traveling."
You are entirely correct. Social distancing and respiratory hygiene are the only things at this point that can mitigate the spread. Testing is confirmatory only. This is what our leaders should be telling us. I am in the process of cancelling an European trip. Not happy about it but doing what is prudent.
"Similar situation! Unable to speak with anyone from the Airline or travel booking website... Tried email, got back a generic answer stating they do not help with bookings via email. Their live chat is closed. My flight is March 15 NYC to Madrid. Crazy."
"Our flight to Spain is booked for school break in early April, similar situation - can't talk to anyone live at Travelocity or at the airline despite the travel ban.Finally managed to find a form on Travelocity to fill out - I guess we have to wait to see if our flights can be postponed or canceled without penalties.Here is the link if anyone wants to explore this option, rather than failed attempts for phone call, email, chat etc.https:/…travel-alert-refunds"
I’d like to suggest that anyone filling out an online form take a screenshot of it and any “thank you for sending” msg you get. Systems have a way of losing things; you may at some point need to prove that you sent an enquiry.

"Canada has just banned all cruise ships through July 1. Given the obvious change in demand for flights to/from Vancouver, is there any chance Air Canada will offer a more liberal cancellation policy, similar to what the cruise industry has done? I have 1st class tickets from Vancouver to LAX mid-May, booked on July 3, 2019. The way I interpret the current cancellation policy, I could be credited for the price of my tickets less a cancellation fee, but the credit would have to be used by July 3, 2020. That's not going to happen. Current dilemma: Unless there's some change in policy, I don't think I'll cancel for awhile - wait and see if they might cancel the flight. My delay in cancelling will give the airline a false picture of actual demand. Thoughts/Ideas?"
"RE # 21 I have Air Canada tickets one way to Costa Rica March 23 . Web site says I must contact Travelocity through which trip was booked initially last Oct. Had to postpone (had waiver) for medical reason (broken elbow). No refund, but given a year to use flight credit. BUT only same passengers, from/to same destination/airports. Still with me?Travelocity BOT says I have no trips booked, no Itinerary found. But Mon. it sent me copy of Air Canada March 23 flight confirmation, so it is in the system. Travelocity Agent told me not to cancel any flights to or rom Costa Rica because penalty policy might change ($300 penalty per ticket). BTW, the original tickets were $1,050 for all three. On Tues. airlines waived penalties for all flights booked anytime before March 31. I reached American Airlines directly to cancel flight tickets home and was given flight credit to fly ANYWHERE before Dec. 31 2020. AA is charging me $50 per ticket to rebook since I bought tickets through Travelocity. Since Travelocity says it cannot waive airline ticket penalties, I took the deal.I cannot get through to an agent at Travelocity or Air Canada, for days now. I phone in the middle of the night, no luck. The Bots cannot handle my request, even to put an agent on. I got to Travelocity Hold on phone today’s, but no time estimate given, just that it would be a long time. Any ideas what I am to do?Edited: 6:27 pm, March 13, 2020 "
My reply below is to #22. Apologies.
"Thanks for the information. The cancellation fee/deadline for changes is different from an email I received several days ago, so good news."
#25 What did you hear? Share details? Hoping it applies to me too.
"From their website:""March 11, 2020 If you purchased a ticket before March 4, 2020 for travel before April 30, 2020, Air Canada will allow you to make a one-time change to your flight without incurring a change fee up to 24 hours before your departing flight. You can also cancel your booking and credit what you paid against future travel. In both cases any fare difference will apply, any residual value resulting from a lower fare will be lost, and all travel must be completed by December 31, 2020.Changes can be made online, through your travel agent, or by calling Air Canada Reservations at 1-888-247-2262 (Other numbers)."""
I just cancelled 2 RT trips YVR to YYZ for my wife in April (booked early February) on the AC website. Full credit for both; took me about 30 seconds. Shows the advantage of booking directly.
Just started a new thread. “TSA temporarily exempting hand sanitizer from liquids rules”https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10…
Where is the Flipkey / Tripadvisor change or cancel reservation - Corona virus policy for the US? All events are being postponed or cancelled and there is no help from this company for guests or vacation rental hosts who need to address this pandemic. The competition- Airbnb has a policy and is allowing US cancellations or date changes. They are waiving the booking fees. Please do your part and help stop the spread of this virus.
"This is good advice. I am a regular traveller from Australia to the USA and for many years I always picked up a cold or flu on every trip. I researched the way to stop this and the advice was hand sanitiser, wiping down the tray table, screen and hard surfaces around me with antibiotic wipes and using saline nasal spray. Although I initially felt a bit silly going through this process, I have had five long haul trips in a row without catching any illness. The same advice is given to limit exposure to COVID - 19 on flights."
">>> Where is the Flipkey / Tripadvisor change or cancel reservation - Corona virus policy for the US? <<<At the moment it is as it was before the Coronavirus situation - at the discretion of the property owner. Owners are able to override their own cancellation policies and refund guests if they choose to do so. Indeed owners are also able to cancel on guests, although there remains a financial penalty for doing so."
"Where is the Flipkey / Tripadvisor - Change / Cancel Coronavirus Policy?Yes, exactly they have made No changes to adjust for this pandemic! Both Airbnb and VRBO are encouraging changes and refunds - they are waiving booking fees. It's time for Tripadvisor to address the severity of this pandemic."
Breaking news: US to extend corona flight ban to UK and Ireland from Monday
"We have a reservation in less than 7 days and are past the point of no return for a refund. I know airbnb will refund the admin fee, but does anyone know if the recent strong non essential travel message from the Canadian government means that we can get a refund by the extenuating circumstance clause? I can't get through to airbnb to ask, and thought someone here may have already figured it out. Possibility we are still going so don't want to cancel to find out just in case we do go."
"The Airbnb extenuating circumstance policy is being updated by the day. They are addressing the issue on their website ( unlike Tripadvisor / Flipkey)Airbnb says they will give a full refund (including Any Fees) booked before 3/13/20, with a check-in date of April 1 or earlier. This is for guests travelling to or within the US.Go to their website - at least they are being proactive."
"thanks, yes, I was in their website, but nothing updated specifically for Canada at the moment. Looks like I will probably cancel as my medical insurance will not cover me (never needed it before, but you never know) and also the government just advised all canadians abroad to return to Canada while commercial means remain available."
airbnb just updated and i was able to cancel immediately for full refund
"BC, Canada Public Health Office this past Thursay afternoon announced people to not travel outside Canada on non-essential travel and that if you do, then you are to self-isolate or quarantine yourself for 14 days upon return to Canada,. Unfortunately, I had to cancel my New York after that and am still trying get refund of WestJet and Alaska Airline flight tickets from online travel agency BUDGETAIR (it is extremely hard going to get refund through them as they don't answer their posted phone lines personally and I have received twitter and one email from them so far but no refund yet). ): My flight to New York is this Monday, Mar,16,"
"Tripadvisor- where is your coronavirus policy?That's great! Airbnb is doing the right thing. Tripadvisor where is your cronavirus policy?I say this as a vacation rental host, and as a guest who wants to cancel an April trip with Tripadvisor. Last I looked on their site - no mention of coronavirus!"
"My last comment was to reply #38MelindaGL, Yes, it's very frustrating when these large travel companies ignore their customers concerning this pandemic. Tripadvisor CEO sent out an email today ""Covid 19 message"" and all it does is give you links to state dept. and cdc links. Nothing to address what they plan to do about cancellations or rescheduling. He is just blowing smoke."
"I booked my ticket to India for 16th March 2020 and from 13th of March India falls under restricted countries. I had to cancel my flight and asked for a refund but I am refunded only 11 dollars out of 586 dollars. Shame on kiwi.com when as it is very unfair to do this. I did not cancel for my personal reasons, It is because of Covid-19. Should I sue kiwi.com?"

"There should be a separate topic on the virus. I had to look to find this. Search for corona and you get beer. My comment: We flew to South Africa through Frankfurt about March 4 and spend the day there. We returned from Cape Town starting yesterday, leaving about 8 days early. Lufthansa and Austrian Airways were worthless in terms of changing our booking. We camped out at the Cape Town airport to find an agent. She did arrive at the appointed hour and was very nice but could do nothing. Also no help on LH/AA website or customer service phone line. So on a 3rd party website we booked great flights from CT to Jo'burg on a regional airline and then on to DC on South African. All flights were fine. Food was even pretty good. (Better than LH's.) Arriving in DC, we were singled out - despite Global Entry - apparently due to the Frankfurt stop (somewhere in the database). I am NOT complaining. I was worried they would just let everyone in. From then on, it was very slapdash - as one passport / Homeland Security agent said. He was NOT happy and knew the process was duplicative and poorly organized. So we gave the same information to several people and had out temperature taken. Despite the very low number of people being processed, this all took so long that the airline had take off all bags and put some in storage. So this is how long it takes for a mid-sized plane with only perhaps 100 people who had come through Europe at some part of their journey."

"I am a UK national, currently in Texas, holding confirmed reservations for return flights to the UK on 1st April. The carrier is Lufthansa. On checking my reservation status, I initially found the reservation and flights listed but labeled Cancelled. Today the reservations are not listed. A search on my booking reference shows that I purchased only a one way trip. It is impossible to contact either my travel agent in UK or Lufthansa on the telephone. Here in the USA the wait for a connection is said to be 4 hours plus but if I hold, after a delay the connection is broken. It is impossible to get information. Emails to Lufthansa have been acknowledged (presumably by a computer) but not answered. I now know why 1st April is known as All Fools Day!"
"Update No. 1 for my initial post. I have received the following critical advice. DO NOT ACCEPT AN AIRLINE'S OFFER OF A REFUND. To do so will relieve the airline of all further responsibility. For travelers stranded by cancelations of return flights, the airline has a duty of care to the passengers ie to keep them informed and to get them home by alternate arrangements. On travel and medical insurance, my policy provider has extended cover for the duration of my stay at no extra cost. My plan is to stay put here in Texas, wait for this initial panic phase to pass and hope that normal customer service will resume."

"Has any high risk older adult received a full refund from Tripadvisor for a vacation rental booked and paid through them?They indicate if you are effected by the CDC advisories for at risk people not to travel and to self isolate - to contact them. Then they send automated responses and won't notify you if they will refund if you cancel. What about the money I paid Tripadvisor in booking fees? They now indicate on the website that they are overriding cancellation policies for arrivals prior to May 1 2020? They tell you to cancel, and if you are due a refund they will send it in 10 days. Just tell us - are you supporting the CDC advisory? Thank you to anyone who has answers."
"Update No. 2 Consequential lossesAs an aside, being stranded does result in unexpected costs. I take a daily drug regime for blood pressure, typical for someone of my age. The drugs I brought with me will run out as my stay is extended. As a precaution, I have arranged a supply from a pharmacy here in the States. To obtain the necessary prescriptions for 3 month supply (I'm playing safe) I paid a $75 consultation fee to an MD. The initial quote for the supply of the drugs from Walgreen's pharmacy was $1029. Wow. I did not accept that and have shopped around and have found a supply at one-third of the cost. It makes me realize, I am fortunate that I have free accommodation. If I was paying hotel costs for a stay of unspecified duration I would be in deep financial trouble."
"Of course you are. Flying is NOT social distancing. People are always honking and blowing on planes. Kids especially, do not practice proper hygiene and touch everything! Flatten the curve!"
Does anyone know what Tripadvisor's Covid-19 policy is? Their Flipkey / Tripadvisor website for travellers and hosts is very unclear. They aren't answering emails. Their competition - Airbnb - has made it clear that they are 100% refunding guests for travel in April.Thanks if anyone has information or has successfully dealt with them concerning cancellations for high risk older adults.
"I unfortunatly had to cancel my vacation rentals. This is the message I received from tripavisor.We’re sorry to hear you want to cancel your booking.

Rest assured, the health and safety of our customers is our highest priority and we will continue monitoring any changes to travel advisories and review our policies accordingly.To cancel, go to your rental inbox, open the payment receipt for the booking and click Cancel your Booking. Please note that the owner’s cancellation policy will apply - you can view this in the payment receipt.If you’re owed a refund and you paid online through TripAdvisor, it will be processed approx. 48 hours after the cancellation (UK working days only).

If you paid the owner directly then they’ll process your refund.We hope you found this answer helpful. If you have any more questions or need more information, please reply to this email and a member of the team will be in touch.Effective, it is left to the owners refund policy. When I found out we were not able to travel it was too late to get a refund back due to the owners policy. I contacted the owner, they were only willing to re-book our dates. However, the dates available were from October 2020 on, which do not work for the large group I'm traveling with. With that said, I'm not receiving a refund for two apartments I rented.Tripavisor will do nothing for me.

TripAdvisor will give full refunds if you call them and supposed to have traveled before the end of April. I was able to get full refunds for both of the apartments I rented in Budapest. Their phone number is 855-785-9714. I was on hold for about 25 min.
"We are waiting to see what to do with our plans to fly from Boston to London RT with Virgin Atlantic from April 14 to April 24. We have already cancelled our hotels with hotels.com, but one B and B in Bath is taking a 50 percent fee for the three days even though there is an emergency with COVID19 and we have cancelled three weeks ahead of the scheduled time. We are disputing it with hotels.com. But back to Virgin Atlantic, they are saying on their website they will offer no change fee but pay the difference in new ticket up to Dec. 31 2020 and will offer open booking if you are not sure when you can go. They say their US 800 phone line is busy for up to three hours so do not call until 72 hours before the flight. I see on Twitter that many of their flights are being cancelled outright. What are travelers doing with their Virgin Atlantic tickets and how is it going? This is really a hardship for many who are stuck. We are Americans so we can stay here. We want a fair deal if the flights are cancelled, but rebooking esp. during this time has seen differences of cost around £1000 one way not Even US$1000, yes that is the difference when our original tickets were on sale a few months ago for around $375RT. Yes, we got a deal back then, but now it looks like we might not get much back if the cost is way too high and we throw the tickets away. We did buy these tickets on a VISA credit card. Could we dispute the cost of the flights if they are cancelled? I just do not know what to do here. I see on Twitter how others are getting treated by Virgin Atlantic and they are very unhappy with the results.Edited: 7:31 pm, March 20, 2020 "

"the thing with the vacation rental companies is that the contract is expressly between the owners and the renters, companies like VRBO and AiRBnB are the brokers who hold the money.Therefore, while renters may be overjoyed at AirBnB's decision, there is a big question whether they are on firm legal standing to even do this, as the contract is not theirs. It is their right to waive their booking fees, but not the whole thing. Owners need to make that call.For more background on vacation rentals from an owner's perspective in these strange times, see https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10…I know of several owners who, because of AiRBNB's policies, have terminated their listing with them. They are going to have to work hard for the owners to get those listings back once this clears up. I fear that if TripAdvisor and VRBO do similar, they could end up with similar issues."

No point in threatening to go to the press or FB either, you need to take this up with whoever made your booking. Also, there is far too much personal information in your post. I suggest you remove it before you receive a shower of spam, or worse still find you have been hacked."

"Hello, I recently traveled to the US from Uganda with a ticket booked off Expedia and was meant to return towards end of April with Egypt air but now am not sure if airports or borders shall be open by then or if even airlines will be flying. Has anyone tried to cancel or change their trip using Expedia? I tried to call but knew immediately that the calls were not going to go through though there's a notice on their page that they'll be sending out emails to people that are meant to travel before end of April asking if they want to cancel, only question is if one cancels after traveling one leg of the journey do you get just a partial refund which in most cases is never enough for a one way ticket back. I tried it with their automated chat and it said Egyptair charges $75 plus any money over the initial cost."
"#79 Many Airlines have ceased flying. President Trump has extended social distancing until the end of April. It is likely your return flight will be cancelled.

I phone at 1AM, 3 AM, 5 AM. I have spent two hours on hold with the promise of speaking to a human agent, but no one picked up. I hope Expedia is treating its customers better. Try to phone first thing in the morning. I hope you are able to get home as soon as you are able. Stay well."
"Thanks, I tried them again and totally failed to get through and according to the comments in their pages everyone is at boiling point. They gave us a cancellation form that we fill in then they cancel automatically only problem is return flights are now more expensive and will most likely cost more towards the summer. Fingers crossed."
See the Department of Transports latest announcement below:https:/…Refunds are not optional for cancelled flights! Hopefully this will make it clear for many airlines playing fast and loose with the rules and policies...
"Just to be clear - the airlines offering passengers a rebook isn't in and of itself illegal (although why anyone would take one with such restrictive conditions as I am hearing is beyond me).

Or does transiting through AMS count as ""physically present in Schengen area""? thanks"
Seems to me you were physically present there and would not be allowed into the US.
"I have not read through this entire thread but just a couple of points 1) it appears in Canada that airlines (Swoop and Air Transat) are simply giving credits for cancelled flights. There is a class action lawsuit pending that is seeking a ruling that you are required to get a refund not a credit. 2) I am concerned about these type airlines not surviving this time frame and declaring bankruptcy and hence there goes your credit. 3) I realize no one has a crystal ball but what thoughts does anyone have on when Countries travel advisories on ""no essential travel"" expected to go till? Summer 2020, Fall 2020? I find it hard to believe that Countries are going to open up their Borders prior to fall 2020."
"OK my take:"" 1) it appears in Canada that airlines (Swoop and Air Transat) are simply giving credits for cancelled flights. There is a class action lawsuit pending that is seeking a ruling that you are required to get a refund not a credit."" Not sure of the legalese, but my understanding is that this is going nowhere yet - it's just an idea some lawyers had to try to make some money (yes I am a cynic). Chances are it's not going to get very far was the consensus when it was brought up on here.Here is the thread where this was discussed: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10…""2) I am concerned about these type airlines not surviving this time frame and declaring bankruptcy and hence there goes your credit.""And if they don't survive, there goes any refund, too. The airlines are bleeding cash right now and don't have cash on hand, especially the smaller ones. They will delay and delay as long as they can. Either way, the money is gone and the customers won't be seeing it back.""3) I realize no one has a crystal ball but what thoughts does anyone have on when Countries travel advisories on ""no essential travel"" expected to go till?""Sold mine on EBay while it was still a thing. :-)The thing is, it's not just the individual countries - it's a whole raft of things - the logistics of being healthy while waiting at the airports (origin, destination and connection), how many airlines are still going to be operating by then, whether hotels, restaurants, theme parks etc. are even going to be open to take guests.I also don't think that there is going to be one date when everything starts opening up - while some areas have passed the peak of their infections (China, and South Korea are two good examples), and while others feel that they are getting close to their peak (Spain, Italy, New York State) there are many other places where it hasn't even started yet in any serious way (think most of Africa).This is going to be a highly complex machine to get started again and won't be possible all at once.Then there is the question of whether we are ready for the second wave that a lot are talking about, once we get through this first wave - and then there is a potential COVID-20 that may loom.And then the vaccines - estimates as to when those would be ready for mass production and distribution are very varied, too.So I would say wayy too many variables to even hazard a guess right now."
"Be aware that the Dept. of Transportation has issued a revised regulation due to Cover 19 on April 3 making it mandatory that airlines issue a refund for travel on any reservation where the itinerary is cancelled by the airline. The important note here is that it implies that if the passenger voluntarily cancels a reservation before flying to obtain a credit good for 2 years, maybe ineligible for a full refund. Haven't seen anyone attempt to get a refund after they cancelled trip but keep that point in mind. If it seems flights are being cancelled day by day as you get closer to your own departure date; WAIT until airline cancels your reservation and then you have full entitlement to a refund if that is what you prefer."
"I am presently stranded in the USA, complements of Lufthansa! Their response to the problem is to change the record of my original ticket purchase from a return ticket to a one-way trip. Fortunately, I have a hard copy of my original purchase paperwork and a full itinerary showing my return reservations. Battle will commence. One addition to your post, a full refund of the fare paid may not be a good choice as the airline is then absolved of all further responsibility for getting a stranded passenger home. Better to hold out for an alternative booking with that airline or another carrier. Note that fares being quoted at present (for 'lite economy') for my return are approximately 300% higher than when the travel rsetrictions were introduced"
How about you don't go and stop being so selfish by putting yourself and others at risk?
Who exactly is that comment addressed to Darwin C ?
"I booked with Air Canada for a return trip from Manchester UK to Toronto in August 2020, however I have recieved an Itinarary change which is now to fly from London UK to Toronto.. with a completely different flight number. I called the airline who advised that because I have non refundable tickets, I can only have vouchers or rebook a new fligt with them (although they also confirmed they wouldnt be flying from Manchester UK until October 2020) I am happy to re arrange a flight for next year with them once they beocme available, which they confirmed would hold the price I have e paid, is this correct? also I dont really have any guauantees that they will resume flying from Manchester, would I be entitld to a complete refund too?Edited: 7:48 am, April 20, 2020 "
"Where are you based Sue? Did you book direct with the airline or via a third party and did you pay by credit card - if you can give that info people will be able to expain what your options are more accurately because as your trip starts and finishes in the UK and was booked from here, your rights etc may differ to those of Canadians booking the same route in reverse.Edited: 8:08 am, April 20, 2020 "
"HiI am based in Manchester UK and I booked my flight direct with Air Canada with my credit card.I am quite happy to rearrange my booking for next year (although flights are not showing for August 2021 as yet,) and was advsied by them that if I did this the cost of the flights would remain as paid...what do yiu advise as the best option..."
"My concern would be about any ATOL protection for any new 2021 flight booked now (I haven't checked recently about that) and whether your travel insurance would protect it if god forbid we are still in a covid19 restricted world next year. Have you checked yourself about whether the rerouting amounts to a cancellation by the airline? I know that Manchester & London are not a million miles apart, but for many travellers an itinerary change like that which was not of their own making would feel like a cancellation. It depends on the cost of course, but for me , in the present situation, if I could I would be trying to a full refund now and decide about next year's trip much closer to the timeI just did quick internet search about departure airport changes and found this on the Civil Aviation Authority's website https:/… under ""What changes can an airline make to my flight,?"" - it says the following:-"".......Where an airline has made a change to your flight (the flight time for example) it is known as a schedule change. This is not the same as cancelling flights. Schedule changes should always be notified to passengers at least 14 days in advance, and the change should only be to the time or the date and not the flight number.Airlines typically advise in their terms and conditions that the time of the flight does not form part of the contract and that it may be subject to change......."" The bit I focused on immiedaitely were the words ""..Schedule changes should always be notified to passengers at least 14 days in advance, and the change should only be to the time or the date and not the flight number..."" You said that your revised itinerary has a completely different flight number to that which you booked to fly on as well as a changed departure and return point in the UK ,is that correct? If so, unless there is something in their T&Cs which gives them the right to do that I would think you may have a case to argue that they have CANCELLED your flight in which case different rules apply and the ""it is non refundable so you cannot..."" argument flies out of the window . There may be something in an EU directive too but I am not familiar with those rules TBH ( other people on this forum may be) . If AirCanada has confirmed that said that they are now not going to fly the route you were booked to fly on in August again before October 2020 , then I feel that they are not being straight with you and would seek professional advice about whether they have to offer you a refund whether they want to or not"
"Menorca. In case of cancellation of flights done online by a European citizen directly with a Canadian carrier departing from Europe does EU or Canadian regulation apply? Sue. I think they should refund you. It is not a minor and insignificant change, they changed the departure city which might not be acceptable fo you."
"My understanding that if the flights are booked to depart from and return to the UK then CAA rules apply just in the same way as if it were a European airline's flight gospodi I think Sue needs to take professional advice to double check , but I agree with you - a departure city is not an insignificant change at all and the fact that the flight number is completely different effectively suggests to me that they cancelled her flights completely and rebooked her on the other s going to London without her knowledge or consent"
"Thank you, Menorca. I agree with your supposition about European regulation being applied to all flights from/to Europe but I wonder if there is any official source on that.. Have not seen any so far.."
"I had three tickets on an Air Canada flight to Costa Rica March 23 (rebooked through the airlines per directive from Travelocity). This was a trip postponed Dec. 31 under trip insurance due to a broken elbow. Air Canada sent a notice five days prior to departure of flight change by ONE DAY, Mon. to Tues., with a different time and flight number. I advised the Air Canada agent that this was a flight cancellation, which per regulations meant passengers were to receive a refund. Last I knew, Travelocity confirmed a refund request was made to Air Canada; funds would reach my original form of payment within eight weeks. That was a month ago so I will be checking with Travelocity again. Never will I book through an on-line company because I got caught between two systems. Air Canada referred me back to Travelocity which had not assigned an Itinerary Number to my rebooking. After ten days of phoning daily, because of swamped phone lines, I finally reached an agent. She had to dig deep to find record of my flight rebooking which was attached to the original Dec.31 Itinerary. Keep in mind I have NO written confirmation of this. I recommend taking screen shots of all communications with the airlines. I uave strong reservations of accepting a credit in flight funds because many airlines will be bankrupt before I can fly again,You have a case because changing a flight number, and destination is a bona fide flight cancellation. Too bad England pulled out of the EU, otherwise there might have been additional protection for you. Once Iceland Airlines delayed our flight, hour by hour, for 9 1/2 hours, treating passengers poorly, until on board. I did file with the airlines, citing EU regs, and received 600 Euros each for the flight delay, the cost of our round trip tickets from Chicago to Paris. Please no criticism from Moderators or Commenters, thanks."
"""Please no criticism from Moderators or Commenters, thanks.""So you only want people who agree with you? Not much of a discussion on this discussion forum if those were the rules.Unfortunately, this is the internet and asking people not to be critical often has the opposite effect. :-)"
"barbara, it is quite easy to respond to your post without being snarky or agreeing with you. One just has to want to.It is always better to book directly with the airline. Travelocity is a separate business that takes your request for a flight, then goes off just as you could go off, to book tickets for a flight on your behalf. They are not employees of Air Canada or any airline, so they cannot process a refund for Air Canada. You are also subjected to two companies' T&Cs - AC's and Travelocity's.The problems start when you have to contact Travelocity to get your refund. They have to go cap in hand to arrange a refund with the airline. Travelocity has an amount of staff to handle refunds under normal conditions, but when thousands of people are contacting them (and the airline), they can't do that very quickly. So you have to wait 8 weeks. Your particular case sounds like a maze to walk through so I hope it works out. Your idea of taking screen shots and asking questions - What is the airline's confirmation number that tells me they have my name on their passenger list for that flight? is a very good idea. But you won't need to do that now, because you've learned a valuable lesson and are going to book directly with the airline. :-) These 3rd party mobs will give you their confirmation number (that they have received your request to book a flight for you), but the Airline's booking number will be different and arrive later when the agent has actually booked your flight.Air Canada will not be bankrupt when you are ready to book again. Good luck."

"Hi, Question; what happens if the travel ban is still in order, but your flight departs? We have a flight Paris Orly (airport is still closed at this moment)- Lisbon - Miami on July 4th with TAP. As of now TAP gives vouchers for flights until June 30th. I can rebook my flight but I have to travel before February 2021 which isn't ideal... If I have to, I'll do it, but that means we can just go for 1 week instead of 3 weeks. TAP states on their website that they will be flying again from Lisbon to Miami twice a week as of July 1st. But I can't see how the travel ban will be lifted at that time (or perhaps we have to go in quarantine two weeks after arrival and two weeks when we get back, which of course isn't an option with work) . Any thoughts on this?"
"If you have non-refundable tickets and the flights depart but you aren't on them, presumably because you will not be allowed entry into the destination (or you are unwilling to go through the quarantine, which I would totally understand), and if your travel insurance will not cover inability to travel because of COVID-19, then I'm afraid that legally you are not entitled to anything back, as I understand it.The airlines may offer a voucher, they may give you your money back, b ut I don't think that either are an entitlement."

Hoping for some help!!We were travelling from Australia to America/Canada April/May but had to cancel a Delta flight DL5459 8th May from Toronto to St Paul to eventually SFO due to Australia imposing an Intl travel ban for non essentials.

Do they need to see passport stamps or other evidence of having been out of banned home countries, etc? Is coming on a flight from a permissible country enough by itself?Thanks in advance for any guidance."
"Hi Sandra, It seems like many airlines are avoiding refund/voucher communication with customers at the moment. If you paid with a credit card you may still be able to put a stop payment on the ticket, however, and get a refund that way. I've done this successfully for a flight cancelled due to COVID and as ter1413 said, you're not obligated to accept a voucher instead. I'd suggest sending another complaint through Spirit's online contact system explicitly stating that you plan to do a stop payment if they don't respond in a reasonable time. Give them a couple of weeks, then ask your credit card company to cancel the payment (and keep a copy of this message to Spirit as evidence that they're not helping you). Good luck."
"I found a very easy way to contact them. Go to their Facebook page and send them a private message in messenger. I had a response within an hour! One trip had the voucher extended to a year, and the other flight they are going to refund our money. It was very easy!"

"Suggest you post on the NYC, PA or MD area boards here, and pick the specific cities in PA or MD for your posts"
I came across this website (www.covidtravel.world). I think it quite accurately says where travelers based on current location are still allowed to go. It works very well for Germany at least and I think for the US too!
"Does anyone have experience transit from JFK to CDG connecting to ZAG? I will be flying to Croatia, transiting thru CDG for my connecting flight. My flight is Delta/JFK -> CDG. CDG/AirFrance -> ZAG. I will have been tested at least 3x before my flight (within 72 hours prior to flight). I have read all the consulate, embassy documentation. I have also spoken to AirFrance (who told me I am allowed to transit thru the terminal for a connecting flight as long as my bags are checked into my final destination and I do not leave customs). My connection time is 2 hours. Looking for any US passport holder who has transited thru CDG within the last 2-3 weeks to confirm."
I am at CDG right now waiting for my flight to Split. You wouldn’t know there was a worldwide pandemic judging by the madhouse at the security checkpoint between my arriving flight and departing flight. It’s business as usual here. Nobody seems to be aware of social distancing (but everyone is wearing a mask). Per the Croatian gov’t website your PCR test must be no older than 48 hours. I had my test on Weds (8/12).
"The health check situation at ORD has improved massively from the horror stories we had heard in March. The airline distributes a health questionnaire during the flight which is quite straightforward. Upon arrival (I am a U.S. citizen resident abroad) I was first asked by the officer at passport control whether I had any symptoms, and then proceeded to the health check area which was well-organized and not particularly crowded. I was escorted by a very polite gentleman to a desk manned by two Chicago firefighters who asked whether they could take my temperature, asked a few more questions, gave me a flyer regarding the quarantine and then let me go on to collect my suitcase. I was relieved at how smooth the process is. I have now completed the 14 day quarantine and am enjoying being reunited with family."
Did you need to have a covid test to transit through CDG? I’m hearing mixed messages. I’ve read in some articles that US citizens can transit through CDG as long as we do not go through passport control or customs (baggage must be checked through). Other articles are saying that France is going to require a covid test even to transit through. But I haven’t heard from anyone with firsthand experience.

gmi: I googled and found a rapid-result option an hour from my home. Was planning on that but then checked with local urgent care and was referred to a local resource. It’s not cheap and not covered by insurance. Cost was $250.00 per person. Tested on a Wednesday and departed on Thurs. The only trouble I had was checking in at LAX where the agent initially said I could not travel but I had the form obtained here https://entercroatia.mup.hr/ and I had copies of the negative test results as well. No questions asked at Paris. When we arrived at Split the border control agent asked to keep a copy of our negative test results so I was glad to have extras.
