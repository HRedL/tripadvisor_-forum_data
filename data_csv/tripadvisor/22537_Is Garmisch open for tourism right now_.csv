"HelloWe have planned to visit Garmisch in September on a motorcycle trip- arriving 17/9/20 and travelling from Scotland, uk.We are due to pay our ferries this week but I was hoping that anyone could advise the current situation with regards tourism, pubs, restaurants and what is the likelihood of there being a tourist season this summer. We do not want to pay for our ferries if there is a chance that Garmisch/ Germany tourism and associated facilities are not going to be open as we won’t get refunds.I know it’s difficult to predict but if anyone can advise what the current situation is and the general feeling as to what the plans are for tourism over the next few months, it would be helpful. Thank you"
Hotels and restaurants are open in Bavaria. https:/…
"Thanks, does anyone else have an up to date assessment- are the tourists returning? We don’t know what to do to be honest at the moment- it’s a difficult situation for everyone just now so we are just holding off but any advice or information on how things are panning our would be welcomed .Thank you"
"I'm not sure if theres anything to worry about. All mountain paths and cable cars are opened, hotels cafes and restaurants too are open. With many germans holidaying at home for (perceived) safety reasons , the german tourist areas are doing quite well. You will need to wear a mask indoors when on a train or a shop or hotel check-in etc, but if holidaying in Garmish you'll be mostly outdoors so you'll not be doing too much mask wearing anyhow. Indeed, at the height of the emergency back in March or April the country areas were actively discouraging people from arriving, if anything to save having to expose the mountain rescue to coivid infected stranded hikers/ mountaineers, but that phase is long over"
"Thank you- just wondering if bars and beer gardens are open and accessible without pre booking etc. In the UK just now, many pubs have a system in place where you have to book a table in advance- sounds like Germany is ahead in terms of reopening but just wondering."
"Table service is compulsory, if there's no table you just wait (or go inside). I've just been to Berlin and never had to wait for a table, apart from at one café on a warm, sunny day.Edited: 2:33 pm, July 24, 2020 "
"Afaik Bavaria is the only state that still has bars and pubs closed. Some have filed a lawsuit, so things may change soon. But restaurants and beergardens are open. Reservations aren’t mandatory but recommended at popular restaurants. The tourist destinations in the Bavarian Alps are very busy these days."
"Well, if a place is very popular, it is possible that they require pre-bookings. But from what I've seen in Munich, they just don't have as much tables as usually, and they increased the space between them, but no reservation was required. Don't forget to wear your face mask when entering a beer garden or restaurant, also when using the bathroom. When you are seated at a table, eating and drinking, of course you can take it off, while the waiters will probably wear a mask.And a word about shops and museums: they have a maximum number of people. Different measures are in place to ensure this. You have signs saying things like ""no more then 3 customers at any one time"", which is something you would see at a very small shop. Our supermarket has an automatic people counter, which is always at about 70 remaining customers. (It's a rather large supermarket in a village.) Some shops require you to use a shopping cart, which is what I've seen at a health food shop. And some have a doorman, that's what IKEA in Essen had, and I had to queue for about half an hour!So, you should expect for a regulation like this to be in place in souvenir shops, too. Watch for signs and/or queues."
