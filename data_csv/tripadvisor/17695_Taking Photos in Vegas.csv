"Hi friends,I'm going to Las Vegas soon. Since it's such a quick trip and since I'm trying to pack light, I've decided that I'm not going to take my DSLR with me. (I also don't even own a point-and-shoot.)My husband and I will both just be taking photos/videos with our iPhones.For those of you who use selfie sticks: would you recommend I buy one for us to share while we're in Vegas? I'm not a fan of selfies of myself (I think I look better farther away!), and I'm wary of handing my iPhone to a stranger to ask for a photo. Husband says let's just take selfies and avoid buying a selfie stick. :-)Thoughts? Thanks!"
"I thought selfie sticks were a big joke, but then I bought one for $1 at Dollar Tree, more for laughs than anything. I think it does make it easy to take flattering photos, and it's small enough to easily tuck in my purse. They don't cost much and you might like it, so why not? Prepare to feel like an idiot when you're using the danged thing (I do), but it does take good pics lol."
I am going to buy a selfie stick for my next trip so my answer to you is go for it!
"How long are your arms? You may not need one.My first thought is that using it too much in inconsiderate or inappropriate ways makes you look like a self-absorbed jerk.I also have one!They're cheap and light and you might find that you like the angles and perspective that you get, so give it a try. Just be aware of your environment and use a little consideration and it'll be fine.Have a great trip!"
"Thanks for the responses so far! Dave, I do have fairly long arms (I'm 5'7, so not a short person with short arms!) but I just hate how I look in selfies. I think it's something about the lens being in close proximity to my face. I would really only want photos of us with the strip in the background or maybe standing in front of one hotel. This is where I'm wondering about the selfie stick since I don't feel completely comfortable giving my phone to a stranger we see walking on the sidewalk. I wouldn't be using a selfie stick while we're gambling, at dinner, etc. I just plan to hand my phone to our waiter to take a picture of us. :-)"
"I will be honest with you, those dang things annoyed the you know what out of me. Walking the strip I got hit by plenty of selfie sticks by people not paying attention or caring about their surroundings. You will see hundreds of not thousands of people using them on the strip and most are being inconsiderate"
"It's not that hard to find an honest people in Vegas. Selfie sticks, narcissistic at its finest."
"We have one and use it sometimes on trips, mainly our hiking trips. I don't see a problem with them if, like a previous poster said, you aren't being obnoxious and are aware of your surroundings while using it.Where we go on trips, a lot of times, there aren't even other people around to take our pic if we wanted to ask them (out on hiking trails, etc). So it has allowed us to get some nice shots with both of us in them and still manage to see some of the scenery in the background. I am a fan if used in appropriate situations."
"I have yet to do my first selfie, but then I was an advertising photographer for almost 40 years, so am probably not the right demographic.Now, in Tokyo, it was almost impossible to walk through the Ginza, due to myriad selfie sticks everywhere, and I mean EVERYWHERE!On Westminster Bridge (London), I saw a guy try to use one, to photograph himself and several girls, with Big Ben (Palace of Westminster) and Houses of Parliament. He stuck his selfie stick, and some form of camera-phone out, and it was hit by the mirror of a bus. The camera-phone came loose, and traffic rolled over it for about 5 mins, before he could recover himself, and then recover what was left of the phone.Maybe there is a lesson to be learned?Personally, I would eschew any form of stick, and just recruit a porn-slapper, to do the photos.Good luck,Hunt"
"<<My first thought is that using it too much in inconsiderate or inappropriate ways makes you look like a self-absorbed jerk.>>Say it isn't so. Can 10B Asian tourists in the Louvre Museum, standing in front of the Mona Lisa (only about 5"" x 7"", BTW) be wrong? I mean, folk travel 1,000's of miles, invest 10's of 1,000's of $, then stand in a 3 hr. queue to see that painting, and all they can see are iPhones on selfie-sticks. Maybe they should have gone 10 years ago?To paraphrase from ""A Christmas Story,"" ""You'll shoot your eye out."" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrAwb9ptu9UOf course, the likelihood is that you will poke someone else's eye out, with your selfie-stick.Still, why don't you go for it?HuntHunt"
"<<since I don't feel completely comfortable giving my phone to a stranger we see walking on the sidewalk.>>Well, most of the porn-slappers are not fluent in English, but as they have their areas staked out pretty well (think for generations), they can be trusted. Just say, ""Por favor tomar nuestra fotograf√≠a con Excalibur en el fondo. Gracias."" Hand them a US$10, and all will be cool.Enjoy, and great photos!Hunt"
"I think you're overthinking .:)In a town full of tourists it's very easy to ask someone to take your picture. There is no epidemic of people running off with phones. That's just in ""European Vacation""."
"Id say between my wife and I, and including everyone I know (im sure I would have heard about it), we collectively have handed our iphones to strangers probably 5,000 times and have had it handed back evey single time. I like those odds.Just curious has anyone of this thread ever had it happen to them or even someone they know that their iphome wasnt returned by someone that was asked to take a picture?Edited: 4 years ago "
"Not an iPhone, but my camera years ago in Jamaica, Dunn River Falls to be precise...asked a local to take our picture,which he did, then jumped down and ran awayEdited: 4 years ago "
Locals always say they never go to the Strip. OP should be fine. :)
