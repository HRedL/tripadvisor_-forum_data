"Hi, myself and my husband are due to fly to Larnaca on 21st March. I have been keeping my eye on the Covid 19 situation and have just read that the UK has currently been placed in a category 3 country and that whilst they are saying to self monitor it mentions a restriction in movement and I was wondering what this might entail and how it would be enforced. We have hired a car as we love to travel around the island and explore new places so I dont know if this will somehow be restricted. Of course everything could change again given the current climate but any insight would be welcome. Thank you"
Just reread the Group 3 instructions and it says to restrict movements. This is typical and is up to you to decide. Of course this might change any time. We wait to see what will happen with last night's Easyjet travellers after results come out
What does ‘restrict movements’ mean and how can the Cypriot government implement them? Can you hire a car and drive around the island for example? Would the local police stop you? Are travel agencies cancelling day tours?
Restrict movement that you decide. Absolutely no checks anywhere with free movement. Group 3 gives option to one involved to act cautiously
Thank you that is really helpful. Let's hope things dont change too much in the coming week or so. All being well I will be back in my favourite part of the world soon!!
I arrived here yesterday and everyone are still going out and about from our hotel as usual.
"thats good to know ethansnan. Where abouts are you staying?Edited: 9:32 am, March 12, 2020 "
Thats good to hear thank you!
Following also as we are due to fly in a few weeks.
"Thanks for the clarification. The term “restricting movement” doesn’t mean restricting movement as you can go anywhere, doesn’t make sense."
"Has the UK been moved to category 2? Some outlets saying it has, and others saying they moved it back to category 3! I don't want to come on holiday to not be allowed out of my hotel room :("
Lauren it has been moved back to category 2 today.https:/…
Very mixed advice on different sites. Very confusing!!! Just recieved an email from Easyjet to say that they have removed the admin fee for changing a flight on line which is a bonus. Going to just keep an eye on the situation and hopefully there will be some further clarity and advice. Always useful to hear from people out there to get a clearer picture of what is going on!
I saw it had gone back to cat 2. We are supposed to be flying first week of April. Jet2 are saying that it is still operating as normal - I'm not sitting in the airport for 2 weeks! I appreciate its a hectic and uncertain time but I would very much NOT like to get to Larnaca and not be allowed to enter!
There is guidance about what self isolation means (see link below) which is quite fair and what we would do anyway. We are not staying in a hotel we just have a villa to ourselves and a hire car. What concerns me is that our holiday is only 10 days so we may not be able to leave! Nice in one way but not exactly practical!!!!
"Cyprus Mail 13 March: UK has been put back into category 2, so it’s self-isolation for 14 days. Obviously not possible if you’re staying in a hotel, even more so if you’re staying in two different hotels and are scheduled to fly back before the 14 days would be up, like us. I wonder if our travel insurance covers this?"
https:/…info.html
"I don’t think it is possible to adhere to those rules in a hotel. If you have a buffet restaurant you will share serving spoons etc with others . Don’t use bars etc. Keep a metre away from everyone. Don’t use buses or taxis - we have paid extra for a taxi from the airport, I don’t think that will happen. I will be interested to hear how you all get on and whether you feel that you got the holiday that you paid for!"
I'm really hoping we get some info soon - this is my first holiday so I'm really anxious that we will get to Cyprus and not be allowed out of the airport as we are now category 2. Jet2 are still saying holidays are operating as normal though?
"Due to fly to southern cyprus on sunday. Advised by the apartment that we should be staying in at Cyprus this am, We will be assessed at the airport and possibly taken to government facility to isolate for 14 days. If we managed to escape to the hotel, they have been advised that we go straight to our room, they are not allowed to even check us in!! we have to stay there for 14 days although holiday only 7 days. She stated that they have been told an announcement today is to be made  to impose even stricter restrictions. We have cancelled although will more than likely loose out money on flight."
Thanks for that information 75nal.The president is due to make a statement this evening. I wonder whether he will cancel all flights from Britain.
"At the moment, their governments guide to self isolation seems a bit different to what we might all originally think when we hear the words ""Isolation"".Cat 2's (from the UK) are to self isolate for 14 days as per below.https:/…20Self-Isolation.pdfDon't go to work, don't use a bus or taxi, don't go to parties, don't visit anyone in hospital, all seems pretty loose and I don't really plan on doing much, if any of them, it's not saying lock yourself in a room , alone for 2 weeks.The airports appear to be screening passengers from all areas, I guess if you show symptoms you may end up in a government facility, if not it's (their version) of self isolation as per the guide.https:/…covid-19-infoI'm told by friends that live there, this self isolation is 14 days of your stay the island, if you "" Isolate Cypriot style"" and leave before that, that's ok, you aren't a problem to them anymore.Obviously this could all change at anytime."
Don't believe flights will be cancelled as many Cypriot students will want to fly back plus the ones who flew there and will want to get back. My guess is that virus has spread in UK much more than authorities there admit as half cases in Cyprus came crom UK plus the fact that UK travellers behaved badly when asked to be screened for fever but forced by police.
https:/…These are the actual guidelines Let’s see what the president says this evening.
"Yeah TwigsOxford, I shall be seeing what the Cypriot President says tonight. Still thinking we might just get to the check in desk tomorrow to find the holiday has been cancelled but then that Tui cancelling not us!! So might just be a night out in a hotel for us in Gatwick but we will see. Gonna call Tui for an update before we leave this afternoon but if the president isnt going to announce his plan until this evening, we might already been on our way, before tui say they have made the final decision on the 13:55 flight scheduled for tomorrow .Its been quite stressful so keeping an eye on it but trying to stay calm, among having people saying we are mad not to just be cancelling the holiday and loosing our cash!!Edited: 7:05 am, March 13, 2020 "
"Definitely not mad! I refuse to cancel and lose all of the money. However if tour operator cancels, they have ti refund you as per T&Cs. Fingers crossed we can still enjoy our holidays!In regards to the isolation, I hope that it just means what you have said above Goudy!"
Good luck suezi and Lauren.
"https:/…This is an interesting development.Edited: 8:54 am, March 13, 2020 "

A friend of ours is going and she sent a link through to me on my phone but I am sorry I dont know how to put it on here. It looks very authentic and quotes they will be flying back to the uk via our programme of schedule flights which will continue to operate till Friday 20th March incusive.It goes on to say we are contacting our customers who are currently in Cyprus and who are due to travel to Cyprus with their options.As I say I believe it to be genuine as the person who sent it to me is due to travel in the near future also
It’s OK Mark it is on Twitter and posted above.I believe that TUI are cancelling all flights up until 28 March.Thanks for sharing.
how will they know if you're using a taxi? I can walk to Paphos I Guess
"@Sarah C, yes you can walk all the way but if you are asked not to use a taxi is for a reason. A taxi driver caught the virus in Paphos for doing just that. All these measures are to stop the spreading and all should show self descipline and follow rules. Just see the body count in Italy"
"We have just cancelled our holiday. We were not due to come until August but I really can't see this being any better by then, it will probably be worse judging by what is happening elsewhere. We have lost our deposit but at least it wasn't the full amount. Hopefully we will get to come again at some future point."
"Aye Cybil, if I had corona I would be dead already! Looks like im walking to Paphos"
"We're off to Paphos tomorrow on a schedule flight.At the moment the airports are reporting they are open as normal and all schedule flights are operating.https:/…covid-19-infoAccording to Jet2's twitter account, they have cancelled all their flights/holidays to Cyprus.https://twitter.com/jet2tweets…I hear Tui may have also cancelled holidays/flights, but I've yet to see confirmation.The CY Government are stating, from tomorrow all arrivals from Cat 2 regions (UK in now Cat 2) will have to ""self isolate at home"" for 14 days after being screened (and passing) at the airport.The requirements for self isolation are herehttps:/…Make what you want of these requirements, but to me they don't appear as stringent as first thought.The UK Foreign office has recently updated their website and they now confirm this self isolation requirement.https:/…cyprus"
Greece has gone to lockdown and probably Cyprus will follow. Wish to all all the best and hope this ends soon. Not really a time for holidays but keep safe
Best wishes to you Cylib. I really hope that these measures will help Cyprus keep the virus to a minimum.Here in Britain we will just keep washing our hands!!!!!
