"Hi! My husband and I are looking for a getaway this June. We are mid-forties, not looking for the club scene in the slightest. Only other time we have been to Cancun was about 12 years ago. We stayed at the Sun Palace and had an amazing time. We loved the coziness of the small resort. Now we are heading back, and our first instinct is to go back there because we loved it, and I see that it's newly renovated. However, Excellence Playa Mujeres has caught my eye every time we have considered returning to CUN. Now I'm torn. Price is not a HUGE factor, but I do like value. We want great food, plenty of drinks, a few quiet places, and a fun bar (not nightclub) to hang out at during the evening.Jr. Suite oceanview at SP (same type we stayed in before), will run us around $2400 w/ $1500 resort credit ( I'm sure there are a ton of stipulations with this credit). As far as EPM, I'm looking at an Excellence Club Junior Suite Ocean View for about $4100.Both rooms look gorgeous. Can anyone offer any guidance? Thanks :)"
Or anywhere else adults only we may like?
This might not be a good time to plan international travel.I would be concerned about my resort closing down.Maybe you are not reading the world news??
"OMG. Seriously? No need to be rude. I'm talking about booking a refundable room in JUNE. What's the harm? If I can't go, I can't go. Still have questions. Bye."
I had no intention of being rude...
"Really? Came across very rude, regardless of your intentions."
"Rude? Like your comments?? WOW!Honestly, have a great day."
"""Maybe you are not reading the world news??""And I'M the rude one?"
Have a great day LeCricket...best of luck on your trip!
"I actually appreciate some questions rather than just hearing all of the bad news. Maybe June won't happen but it's still nice to dream about a day when things will return to ""normal"" and we can resume travel. I am also curious about SP since the renos."
"To answer part of your question, EPM is a larger resort. Have you looked at Beloved? Unfortunately it is closing this Friday until June but it's a fabulous small resort."
Thanks. I appreciate your help. I will look into beloved I’m thinking this forum is not the place for me. Happy travels.
"""I’m thinking this forum is not the place for me. Happy travels""LeCricket,There really are a lot of friendly people here. But I totally understand how you could think otherwise.Unfortunately, there seem to have been a very large influx of people with very few posts who are really changing the tone of this board. They've done nothing to contribute to the forum community as a whole and seem to have nothing better to do than be sarcadtic, mean, rude and nasty.These are not the people who normally post here and my hope is they'll fade away once things get back to normal. They thrive on chaos and seem to live to create it. This is an excellent place to gather info about Cancun. I hope you stick around. I think you'll see just how helpful people here can be. And I was thrilled to see your question. It's nice to think of something beyond this virus."
Thanks so much. We will see. Just because my question doesn't mention COVID-19 doesn't mean I have my head in the sand. Oh well.
"Joan S,I hope you are not referring to me as I do not believe that I was either ""mean"" or ""nasty"".OP took great offense when I asked if he/she was watching the world news.....quite honestly, I am not watching any news from Japan....thus my question."
My post was a general observation. It as not directed at any one person but just a statement as to what I've observed on this forum the past few days. And I don't want new people coming here looking for info and advice on Cancun to be put off by people whose sole purpose seems to be creating havoc. They don't have one single post that offers any advice or information. I don't have any idea what you posted. The posts were deleted before I logged on today.
"My posts were not deleted.....all deleted posts were from the OP. I do however, understand what you mean about some of the new posters. Note, I am not a new poster nor would I ever be mean just for the fun of it. We should all be in this together.I hope everyone makes good decisions and has good days."
"HiHave you thought about Le Blanc Spa Resort? Very nice, adults only with really good food for all inclusive. And yes, many people are sooo rude on this forum. It’s an odd clique"
"Is beach, water ambiance abd location of any importance? I can share my observations having stayed many times at the Westin Resort next to the Sun Palace and from a one-month stay at the La Amada residence condos which are 2 resorts south of EPM.on Playa Mujeres. Bluer water: Water is more ""tropical blue"" at Sun Palace. The Playa Mujeres area water is still blue, but it doesn't have the same sparkling blue tropical sizzle as the water off Sun Palace and along the Cancun hotel zone coast. Subtle but different.Beach width: the beach is wider at Sun Palace. I noticed the beach was very crowded with close proximity lounges whenever I walked past EVP.Location: You've stsyed at the Sun Palace so you know it's located in the thick of the hotel zone tourist infrastructure with restaurants, shopping, markets snd a public transportation system to take you up and down the hotel zone. EVP and the Playa Mujeres resorts are isolatd with no services in the immediate area other than what is self-contained on your all inclusive resort. There is taxi service of course and you can take the paved path about a 15 minute walk south to the first Plsya Mujeres gate entrance where you can also get a Collectivo van next to Villas del Palmar for a ride into Cancun city if you wanted.Compactness vs expansive space: the luxury and conveniences of the Sun Palace are arranged into a more compact space in a well developed hotel area. EVP as all the Playa Mujeres resorts are very large/expansive places with a lot if space dedicated to enhanced tropical landscaping. A lot more walking too.The difference tends to be more experiential/atmospheric. Hope this adds to your research."
"Thank you. Your comparison was quite helpful. In regards to SP's location, I am remembering that there wasn't much nearby. Is it in a busier area than I remember? It's been so long. We did love the beach there. This was in 2008, after Wilma maybe? Sun Palace had one of the best beaches by far during that time. Looks like many beaches in the area are nice again."
