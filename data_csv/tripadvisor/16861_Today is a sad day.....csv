"I am actually about to cancel a trip to Vegas over 4th of July weekend to go to Orlando for an exciting weekend at Universal Studios. Never in my life did I figure I would do such a thing, but we have been to Vegas 4 times over the past 6/7 months so that sort of eases the pain. Good news is that we have another Vegas trip planned for November. I guess there is a first time for everything."
"You couldnt pay me to go to OrlandoUnfortunately Ive been there probably 10 times for work (National Meetings, trainings etc). I cant think of a place that Ive spent time in that I like less. Maybe Albuquerque....Edited: 5 years ago "
"Back in the late 90's Blazing Pianos at the Mercado was the best party in town. It has since been replaced with a Howl at the Moon, not nearly as good.City Walk is good for one walk thru but once you've seen it you've pretty much seen it all."
July 4th weekend at Universal in Orlando--Jeebus I can't imagine that hell.
"Universal Studios is a blast, love it. But it will be soooo hot (like Vegas wouldn't be) lol. We went once in June and between the crowds and heat I said never again in the summer! We went two years ago right before Thanksgiving, flew back home the day before. Weather and crowds were perfect...Have fun though!"
Dry heat versus wet. Plus you'll definitely be outdoors more at Universal. Yech.
"The heat will be nothing like Las Vegas.hot, humid, disgusting oppressive Heat vs very tolerable dry heat.The heat will be like well...Baton Rouge where the OP is from."
"I honestly almost cancelled my trip in July for Orlando. I have stayed inside Universal at the Pacific Resort and loved it. There is a boat that takes you to the park, restaurants are great- they have a Hard Rock, and the parks are just awesome. Good for you, something different. The only difference is no nightlife after like 12 really. There is a fake club, but it is lame. Have fun. My favs is the Spiderman ride and the Mummy Returns."
"lol, yeah definitely the same type of heat. At least we are staying on property so when it gets hot in the middle of the day we can go back to the room/pool to relax and staying on the resort gives us the express passes to get ""front of the line"" privileges to help with the overwhelming crowds. All in all it shouldn't be too bad I just hate cancelling such a well planned trip. We had a balcony room at Cosmo reserved to watch the fireworks and were going to try Lago, STK and Milos (dinner) for the first time this trip, guess I can still schedule the same experiences for Nov, the weather will be nicer for sure."
"We've all had to cancel Vegas trips when life intervened. This of course is the biggest reason for booking everything direct, at least if doesn't cost you much to cancel and/or reschedule. Vegas will always be there."
Orlando in July. You have my sympathies.
"You all are right. The humidity, then rain, then humidity, then rain, then , I hate this place were true every time I went there. We did have to stop in the fake saloon many times to just get outta the heat. The cut in line is a must. Just did 6 Flags out here, like fake Orlando, and it rained the whole time. I love, love love when it rains and is overcast= noone there= we did almost every ride, water park ride, fake surfing, you could do. HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"We are just back from 14 days in Orlando (all at Disney) and it will be a long time till I go back , the heat was totally different to Vegas and was horrible (I like the heat but the humidity was a killer) if anyone suggested I cancel a Vegas trip for Orlando they would see my angry head very quickly !!"
"Bwa ha ha ha ha! We'll see you there! My 10-year-old read the Harry Potter series this year, and it's the only vacation that would do for her. Since her Dad and I have been on our Vegas vacation (without her) already, I had to give in. Expecting hell on earth, but not going to worry about it as it will make her year!"
"Oh, friend. You truly are lost. I mean at least go to the gulf side!"

I personally did not get excited about the Harry Potter area at all.
You are probably better off with the Orlando trip. You don't want to wear out Vegas.
"Yuck; Hot, humid, & sweating profusely outdoors while waiting in a huge crowd & line to get inside some A/C surroundings with drab food in comparison to a hot but dry heat with almost immediate access into many cool & comfortable Resort properties that offer up great food.Yes; I'd have to agree with you. That is most definitely sad.Edited: 5 years ago "
Well I love Orlando. It's different to Vegas but as with any holiday..... It's what 'you' make it.As for the heat..... I'll take any kind!CheersDavy !!!
DavyCheer up sleepy jeanOh what can it mean to a daydream believer..Every time..songs come in my headDavy Jones. The Monkees. Every time.
"Sad day? For sure.For those in Charleston, SC or parts of the SW hammered by storms, or parents of those killed in wars, or ....."
canceled vegas for Trip to Atlantis Bahamas.
This could spring other topics to discuss like the entitlement epidemic.
"Btw Davy, I have seen many of your posts and you have a wonderful outlook.Edited: 5 years ago "
"This year will be our first trip to Vegas, San Francisco and Anaheim. We've been to Orlando 8 or 9 times and I'm missing it this year!!"
"CarolVit (bridgefan, Losvu) strikes again, belittling people."
I wouldn't want Orlando in July but I don't even like the humidity in MN in July-LOL! Have a good time and at least you have Vegas in Nov to look forward to-wish I did-our next Vegas trip probably won't be till next March or April-we only get to go once a year-you are lucky!
I am in the minority I am a huge Orlando fan which I prefer but the July 4th weekend will be hot and very very crowded.
