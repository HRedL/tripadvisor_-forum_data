Nobody can possibly know what the situation will be by 3 April.
"If you make the trip, upon return, you’ll have 14 days self quarantine in the US, do take that self quarantine very seriously. .Stop and think why you are still going? Putting friends, families and home communities at risk. Chances of catching covid19 is small, but the burden on you and all communities along the way and back is big."
"Since you already booked, and apparently cannot cancel for free, just wait and see.If situation stays like this, the no fly policy will probably be extended. If not, the situation must have been improved considerably."

"@tanian0ttAs Hong Kong does not fall under mainland China (in Malaysia immigration context), you will be allowed entry to Kota Kinabalu, Sabah (Borneo) through separate lounge for thermal scanning and questionnaire of main symptoms (fever, sore throat, cough and shortness of breath) prior proceeding to immigration counter.Should you need reassurance, reach out to Sabah Tourism officials for quick response:http://www.sabahtourism.com/alert/Another useful site for your reference:Ministry of Health, Malaysia (Annex 9) - moh.gov.my/index.php/pages/view/2019-ncov-wu…Echoing to @sydneynick point, however, do reach out to Malaysia Airlines (MH) in your locality or online for clarity (reiterate the confirmation of thorough bookings in Kinabatangan, Sabah as well) as their answers - whether sooner or later - will be absolute.Edited: 10:09 am, February 29, 2020 "
"Mac - where are you getting your info re quarantine requirements for US returnees? There are currently no restrictions on returns from Hong Kong. In fact Hng Kong is a Level one alert:CDC does not recommend canceling or postponing travel to the following destinations. Travelers should practice usual precautions.https:/…coronavirus-hong-kongNot that this is relevant to the OP, as noted above, but there may be US travelers who don't need the incorrect info.Edited: 10:21 am, February 29, 2020 "
"helloi had a similar situation with air france. You have to continually check their website or you can connect with the airline on facebook and message them there and they can send you a link or tell you if any changes to refund rules if you give them your booking reference. Right now its too early so you have to keep checking as it gets closer. Best wishes, hope things turn out ok for you.."
"Mac has been spreading disinformation here on TripAdvisor repeatedly recently. For OP's specific destinations, there is no need to undergo quarantine upon returning to US."
"Mac you need more coffee in the morning.""If you make the trip, upon return, you’ll have 14 days self quarantine in the US""OP is from the UK, not the US."
"^^^ And, the info is wrong.All anyone needs these days is rumors and disinformation......"

"So Hong Kong is good? I myself have a flight to Kuala Lumpur from JFK (via Cathay Pacific) with a layover in Hong Kong. Im not scared of catching the virus Im more scared of the hysteria surrounding it. People are telling us to do anything we can to avoid the Hong Kong layover and its really starting to scare me!! Like if so many people cancel their flights our flights get canceled. Were leaving on 3/21...Edited: 12:11 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"What are your options? Rebook with a carrier including a stop in Tokyo?? That's a Level 2 US CDC travel alert. I have travel planned for a month out (not Hong Kong, another region with ""cases""). I monitor day by day. Isn't the term ""game day decision""??I actually wish my tickets were for Hong Kong. With present info, I would not cancel a trip (or be overly concerned).Edited: 5:28 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"There is also possible issue when going back to work. Most of the major employers here in Canada are telling staff that if they travel to the affected destinations (as per Health Canada's list), they are not allowed back to the office for 14 days. I would imagine this is not something exclusive to Canadian employers.HK is in the Canada and UK governments' list of caution destinations.Of course if you don't have to work, or can work from home for 14 days, it's no big deal.Edited: 6:25 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"We are in Hong Kong at the moment, although cable cars and theme parks are closed (we wouldn’t have used them anyway) we are thoroughly enjoying our 3 days here. It is quiet but all public transport is running so plenty to see and do.Do bring some face masks with you, you don’t have to wear them all the time but a couple of places may insist on you wearing themEnjoy Borneo, if you’re going to Luching message me and I can recommend a very good taxi driver"
{We will be staying at rasa ria in Borneo don’t think that is in Kuching.}The Shangri-la Rasa Ria resort is just outside of Kota Kinabalu on the other side of Malaysian Borneo to Kuching in the Sarawak Province. They are around 1000km apart.
"I think the situation in Hong Kong as far as COVID-19 is concerned has somewhat stabilised. Higher risk countries are South Korea, Italy, Japan and Iran. I don't think there is likely to be travel ban imposed by Borneo immigration unless things take an unexpected turn in the next few weeks. Enjoy your trip!"
When are you staying at rasa ria bradjill?
"Im not, tanianOtt. Just simply passing along information regarding its location compared to Kuching."
