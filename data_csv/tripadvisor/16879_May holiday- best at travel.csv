"Hi, I was wondering if anyone else who booked with best at travel (or any agent really) for May half term has been contacted? They called yesterday regarding our holiday on 24th May saying it is looking more and more likely that we would not be able to travel and gave us 3 options -Change the datesA credit note with agentClaim money back through insuranceI mentioned to them that I would not mind changing to the October half term but realise that flights/ hotels are a lot more expensive that time of year. The agent said this will be dealt with on a case by case basis and would be willing to email the hotel to see if they would honour the price already paid as many have been willing to do so! I was just a bit concerned about the possibility of travel restrictions still being in place in October but the agent confirmed they would just move the dates again?I am just wondering has anyone successfully moved their booking to later in the year/next year?Thanks,Nat"
"Hi Nat, Moving the holiday isn't an issue, it's whether the agent, airline, hotel will still be in business by then.It all depends what you would rather do, but don't take everything your agents say on board. Talk is cheap - especially when they're making speculative statements by ""confirming they could move the dates again"" Ideally, you need to clarify with them IF the trip is cancelled, and if not why not. There are several different reasons/factors and it depends on how correct their response is.Flights are cancelled, airports are *generally* closed, visas suspended, hospitality venues closed etc.They haven't mentioned a refund - but you're entitled to one. However, most agents and indeed airlines are not playing by the rules, but there's still a correct way to deal with the process.Unless there any overarching policies in your booking conditions, if you cannot proceed with your travel you have the right to a refund under PTR and LT 2018 (providing you booked through an agent and there are multiple components eg. Flight, hotel etc)Think about it - why would an agent be contacting you (rather than vice versa) if there weren't any issues? Agents are trying to get people to rebook not to help them but to hold on to their money that they should be refunding (and also keeping cash in their hands).Bear in mind the landscape may be very different in October, even if everything is safe and healthy every travel agent, hotel and airline will be operating (or not) in a very acute financial situation so there is a risk to keep a booking or reschedule.It all comes down to priorities, some may prefer not having to fight with agents to get what they are entitled, some may prefer cash in hand, or some may prefer to reschedule or otherwise. I'd take the chance on there being far better deals to be had in the future and let my cash work for me in my hand now.Edited: 7:50 am, April 04, 2020 "
"There are various threads on here linked in the same subject albeit different agents. The law appears if they have cancelled the flight they should be offering a full refund. The agents though appear to be doing all they can to avoid that putting pressure on the customer is to rebook with hiked up prices added. Now maybe its me, but they are completely setting the scene in profiting from a rebooking because we know they will increase the flight and hotel price , and any future travel is speculative , no one only the airline knows what they would sell those flights for , indeed if they still have bums on seats. We have all searched high and dry for the best offer when we made our original booking , now the agent can completely make what they like as they have those locked in who have paid and are worried they will lose their money. Their dialogue to the customer is completely sales talk, making you think its a favour they are offering . Legally they should give a refund and full one if the product ie holiday is def not going to be delivered, but i suspect in their sales brief each day they are told not to offer that and refuse to consider it. Agents also know each insurer works differently with various excesses applied so i think by suggesting that they sort of put in a fear factor - you dont go and rebook with us know ie you could lose out.i would firstly speak with the person you made the payment with for their advice ie the credit card and see what they suggest , then speak with your travel insurance, any rebookings wont be covered as Covid 19 is now a known event - so if you rebook you could really be stuck in with them going further and no chance of money back."
"Shaun we posted same time .lolBut both saying the same.Shaun what is PTR and LT 2018 , i googled it and couldnt find anything linked to travel , do you have the full details, if so it would be ideal to see so people have some knowledge when to make applications to the small claims court and also advice the agent they know the law and want their money back."
"five days ago on the guardian web site---------------------------------------------------------------------I booked a tour package, can I get a refund?In theory you are much better placed. If your holiday has been cancelled by the tour operator you should get a full refund – within 14 days. However, this week the tour company body Abta called on the government to allow firms up to four months to process refunds. It said travel companies just do not have the money to refund customers within two weeks.In recent days the Guardian has been inundated by holidaymakers complaining that they can’t get a refund from their tour operator after their trip was cancelled. Some have spent in excess of £10,000 but instead of a refund they are only being offered an unwanted change of dates.If the tour operator collapses before it is able to compensate you, the government-backed Atol scheme is there to step in. The scheme will also continue to cover those who elect to switch their trip to a later date.If you want a refund, we’d advise you to contact the company in question stating that this is all you will accept.Several readers have asked about trips booked for July onwards. We would wait and see. There is little to be gained by cancelling now."
"full link out of the guardian online - tells us pretty easily our rights, small claims court in the future will really be kicking the buts of these agents - for those still in business . the links covers tons of stuff def worth reading .https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/3…"
"Thank you for the advice Shaun, really appreciate it as it is things I would not have thought of. I thought it was a bit early to be contacting regarding a holiday end of May and they did not say it was cancelled just looking likely we will not be able to travel.Cheers, Nat"
"This is really helpful thanks you, I will have a read of the article,Thanks,Nat"
"Just to add, the one thing you need to do first is to document a written complaint and request for refund with your agent.It helps to find out things like ...a) if they have a complaints process - usually linked on their websiteb) if they have a limited company behind them, do a search on companies house and find the Directors and registered business adress and send a letter to company registered address.c) Often the people manning the calls are just frontline staff, so do ask for an 'escalation' or manager or a 'high level escalation' teamd) do put a time constraint on your complaint, if only because they *should* have 14 days to refund your money from when it becomes apparent the package is materially different or cannot be fulfilled.e) do express that you reserve the right to follow all avenues for reparation, not least Small Claims Court, or (fi you paid with Credit Card) Section 75 or your financial provider as you feel they have failed in their contracted delivery to you.All of this sounds a bit OTT, but - big boys games, big boys rules.Of course, we'd all love to try to find a compromise and help each other (including agents) but if they're not playing ball, I'd be bringing a bigger bat."
"Nat, as for the agents saying ""not looking likely"" - that doesn't help anyone but themselves. Right now, you can't get to Dubai to have the holiday you contracted them to deliver, and there are rights and regulations in place that they've signed up to comply with accordingly.Let them have the hassle. Just ask them directly (with a nod to BBC's Line of Duty) - * ""answering yes or no only, can I travel to Dubai with the present circumstances to have the holiday I've paid for?They know the rules.Edited: 8:53 am, April 04, 2020 "
"Thanks Shaun for the fantastic information you have given today, i think that really helps everyone going forward. And i would agree you need to be firm and not think the agents are helping us , they are only trying to hold our money to stay in business . Id also suggest everytime you call or they call you that the call is recorded. take name of person , time and date. Out of curiosity do we know if any hotels have currently closed in Dubai ie locked their front doors and dispersed of staff, i ask this as if and when things appear to start to go back to normal what we are expecting could be broken , it could be the hotel is not ready to receive guests , the hotels will have huge issues they need to do obviously all planned maintenance of its sites from the boilers/plumbing/pools /landscape/pest control getting staff back , so my point is if this has happened no agents can really guarantee that hotel you have booked will actually receive you. an example friends literally got back on the last flight to london from miami having been stranded in Florida and having to move to miami at their cost to get on this flight , on the day they left every hotel in miami beach closed it doors these were all the big chains hyatt. four seasons. mandarin etc and staff were dispersed of, they had told my friend even when they got back to normality the reopening of the hotels would be a large scale lengthily operation and could take months . We just need to really think out of the box about not if we can travel but how that travel will be received..Edited: 9:46 am, April 04, 2020 "
"No worries LoveDogs.I know it's a cliche - and betting is ""haram"" in some quarters - but in times likes this, like she says in Snatch... ""all....bets...are.... OFF"".Some hotels will just be blocking bookings, others will be ticking over with skeleton staff, and others - well, who knows? Atlantis has advised its media partners that it closed for instance, but what 'closed' is depends on many different circumstances.Some hotels are looking to keep ticking over and help out by accommodating COVID-19 cases; Melia in Barcelona Sarria for instance.Bear in mind also lots of the hotel companies have to balance commercial factors, not least occupancy (even before COVID-19 Dubai hotels were at record-low occupancy levels) so in some cases, chains will merge bookings across properties to have fewer hotels open. Look at the airlines - some are flying ""ghost flights"" or with as little as 10 passengers on board on some routes around the world."
"Thank you all, I am more leaning to just ask for our money back now instead of rebooking. Hopefully if we get it We can always put the money aside and book again when everything back to normal!"
"We were supposed to be going to the Maldives tomorrow and I booked through Best at Travel.As we’re in lockdown and Emirates aren’t even flying at the moment, my only option I was given was to change dates or claim on insurance.My insurance company are saying I’m not covered, which I don’t believe so I took the option of transferring the holiday to next April.As I used to work for a Tour Operator, I understand that they have not got the money to be refunding everyone and it’s better to transfer the holiday and hopefully keep them in business. After all, it’s not their fault this has happened."
"We booked with best at travel for a Dubai holiday in March. We knew we were entitled to a refund in accordance with the travel regs but they have point black refused all refunds. Although we were not too happy at first we could understand this as they just wouldn't survive if they refunded everyoneThey offered us a good deal to amend our booking for October, not charging us any extra and after much consideration we decided to go with this.We contacted our insurer who confirmed that our travel insurance would remain as was if the trip was amended - it wouldn't be regarded as a new booking . It was to their advantage to do this as they also confirmed that they would accept a claim for the full amount of the trip minus £50 excess.We were also offered a credit note by best at travel but we felt much better protected legally by rescheduling. If our October trip can't proceed we wont be any worse off than we are now and if Best at Travel go bust we are still covered by Atol and our credit card provider."
"Thank you chrissie, that is very helpful! Can I ask who you are insured with?"
"Hi Nico, We are insured with Aviva through Barclays, it's a packaged bank account."
"This game is about leverage, and the longer it goes on the more the odds are stacked in the agent's favour.This coming week could change the whole scenario, and stack the odds very heavily in their favour, especially if Government accede to ABTA's request to extend (or even waive) the regulations that stipulate you are entitled to a refund.This is why I'd recommend registering a written complaint now, rather than later, when it may be too late. Look, it's not about getting the refund - it's about playing the game to get leverage (which may not necessarily be a refund). Far better to get them on the back foot, then you can play the good guy and say, ""tell you what, we will stick with you if you thrown in x.... y.... z..."" Let your rights work for you, rather than let them get away with that jiggerpokery.As for the thought of the agents going out of business, they can do one of two things - refund you as per your rights (it's not your lookout if they don't have the processes/funds in place to protect your money) - or you can try for better leverage to get more value on another holiday.Don't' forget it's your money - and they've called the ball when they had the opportunity to do the right thing and look after you by showing you goodwill, but instead they're trying to jiff you."
"Thanks shaun, really appreciate your advice, will look into it all tomorrow."
Can't answer for Best at Travel but I have been successful in getting an hotel that I booked direct for this week on a none refundable basis to move to November - I will pay the extra if it is more.I have taken a risk because if we are not able to travel in November I will lose that money unless the hotel is prepared to extend again
Thanks for your post Latimer.
"ive penned a long winded email to Southall travel asking for a full refund for my holiday in May too.. I have highlighted why the holiday wont be going ahead and what my consumer rights are for getting a full refund... The more I think about it, I cant see me wanting to go on holiday this year... firstly I wont have the time, and secondly prices will be inflated in October half term."
"FCO has updated their advice against all non-essential travel to make it indefinite (as opposed to be until 16 Apr).So, if your plans are past this date they should now be able to update you on your options.If it's just the deposit that's been paid, then you should clarify about the options are for a refund.IF there is a balance to pay, and they're still not offering a refund it's worth getting a documented answer for your options. There is a school of thought that suggests IF you're confident in getting the holiday full cost refunded, it's perhaps better to pay any outstanding amount in full rather than risk foregoing 'just' the deposit if they're going to interpret as breach of conditions.Similarly, if there's a doubt of the agent staying in business if you've only paid a deposit and elected not to pay the balance that *may* have an impact s also.My hope would be that agents do the right thing, even against a future date of travel should a refund be requested."
"@ Faddy - I think that's a wise move, do keep us updated please and good luck."
"thanks Shaun C... I've always generally ended up paying in full at time of booking so they're holding around £4k of my money.. not to mention all the other bits I've booked on the back of it.. car hire, car parking, tickets for parks etc... it works out a fair bit... I was prepared in my head to wave goodbye to a lot of the money, but the more I think about it the more I want to make sure I recoup every single last penny...what's the consensus on me getting a refund on my entertainer voucher app :)"
"@ Faddy, I know you like your money but I think the Entertainer app refund may a stretch...everything else - fair game!Your best chance I'd say with them is perhaps contact them, explain the circumstances and plead for a goodwill gesture of a concession for when you return.""Sky kids get no sweets""Edited: 8:24 am, April 06, 2020 "
hahaha... saving grace for me not going Dubai is Mrs Faddy wont be spending any of my money out there!!!
"@faddy , Mrs Faddy is going to expect double next time :-) ."
Lets hope Cara jewellers doesn't survive this epidemic!!!!!!!
"The new FCO statement is not good in this regard as any tour operator can state that the date period is not defined, so until the date your flight actually departs they can not offer you a refund as it could (in theory) go ahead although for us with May half term bookings it does not look an option. So they can just keep your money until the flight is officially cancelled."
"The flights are cancelled as they are. You can't go as it stands - not just for FCO advice but otherwise at all.This is why it's imperative IF one is looking for a refund to clarify the options (not the rights) with their agent. Risk being, if one delays and the ABTA/Government discussions result in either waiving or extending refund repayment timescales the traveller is in a weaker position.I'd respectfully disagree that the FCO update benefits the agents - far from it. Previously, they could say they were hopeful that post 17 Apr trips could be going. BY FCO saying it's indefinite, that's far less likely - hence more 'strength to your elbow' to argue a case for a refund.The issue with thinking negatively on this is the 'wait and see' leaves time for a) flights to restart, or the other restrictions to be lifted b) your rights to be weakened."
"That's exactly what I have tried to re-iterate in my email to them. FCOs advise is secondary, and ive emphasised on the fact flights are cancelled, visas are not being issues and the hospitality venues are not operating as usual... im hoping that sways them to refund my holiday....Ive spent the day looking at the same holiday later on in the year and its nearly double the price.. im kind of thinking that everyone is playing silly buggers and increasing the prices artificially... lets hope that's not the case.."
"@ Faddy - an option could be a Refund Credit Note, as (theoretically) you'd take it now then hold it until end of July, and if unused, they would refund you.That seems to be the preferred ABTA stance, as a last resort, so lots of agents perhaps are not being very forthcoming about them. It's a tough situation for everyone but it's not helped by travel providers not being fair, reasonable nor upfront about traveller rights. I think there's also an argument some are playing for time.The nightmare scenario from a traveller's point of view is should FCO be lifted and Emirates start taking commercial passengers, not being able to get visas leaves travellers on a very sticky wicket in terms of redress. Crazily, it's not considered an issue enough to cancel and won't often be covered by insurance.I don't think Emirates will be flying commercially any time soon as they don't have the staff to man the planes at present.Also, Dubai has extended the closures of venues even further into April.Check this thread out >>> https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g295…"
FYI Southall Travel have totally ignored my email I sent them!!!!!
"Looks like it could be letters to the Directors or Registered Business Address then Faddy >>>https:/…01869431Have you tried the COVID-19 email address they're listing here? >>>https://www.southalltravel.co.uk/contact.aspxKeep at them, and I hope it works out for you.

"Hi Faddy, I booked with southall travel due to initially go to Dubai on 19th March. I was in dialog with them in the days prior and was advised if I didn’t move my holiday, I’d likely lose my money. The took extra money to move to June. As this was a panic I ended up doing it. Looking back I should never have agreed but was wrongly advised. I’ve emailed southall travel countless times. They’re nothing but crooks."
@Shaun C - I'll keep you in mind next time im in Bury market... haha its a bit run down now.. way past its heyday..@ScottJem - why did they charge you more money?
"Just received a response.. seems quite generic.We write in reference to the email correspondence. Please be advised that we have placed full refund request with the airline & hotels, however as per the travel advisory they are offering refund in the form of a credit note. Rest assured all possible measures are being taken to safeguard your payment and the refund (full refund or credit note) will be forwarded to yourself as and when the same is claimed from the respective airline. While we understand your concern, request you to bear with us for 3 – 4 weeks for the credit note."
"Faddy - it may sound petty, but you need to ensure the 'credit note' is an ABTA approved Refund Credit Note.The benefits of the RCN are twofold; it's ABTA?ATOL protected against collapse of the agent (which is very likely with some of them) plus it reverts to a cash refund if not used by end of July.Worth going back to them just to confirm, but in the meantime, it's progress - well, baby steps. Keep the faith brother!Edited: 6:21 am, April 08, 2020 "
What’s to stop them Making a change and giving you an indefinite timed credit note that’s ABTA backed?
"@ Harasym - if you read the link from ABTA about the RCN you will see that is what's stopping them from doing as you suggest. It's ABTA's proposed solution that's a compromise for all parties; it relieves the pressure from demanding refunds and gives the option of a cash refund. It's not ideal, but a decent middle way.Have a gander at this thread also - hope it helps >>> https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g295…There's no 'silver bullet' in any of this sadly. Good luck with your situation.Edited: 2:43 pm, April 08, 2020 "
So I have been on a lengthy call with Southall travel today. They rang me themselves which surprised me a fair bit..So Southall Travels initial offer is to allow me to rebook the flights for any time in the next 700 days with no extra charges or no difference in price difference in economy saver tier... however I will need to cover the costs on any price difference in hotels. this is where they have the chance to rip me off.. same prices for the hotel in October half term or Xmas is an additional £2k above and beyond what I have paid... So in short I told them to do one and go back to Emirates and Jumeirah and get me a refund... at this stage it seems they are sounding out their customers on how they react to the credit note... there was no sense of urgency or hard sell for me to accept the credit note. They did assure me the credit note will be backed by ATOL/ABTA regulations so that is a positive if it was to happen.
"Hi Faddy, it was a price difference on the hotel I believe."
Yes the flight prices remain near enough the same throughout the year.. give or take £100ish...The hotel prices are what is inflated...
"Hi faddy,I am still waiting for a response from best at travel to my email sent last Sunday. I asked for a move of date to October from may, which does have a massive price difference for us! Initially on their first call to me they said some hotels where honouring same prices but would be on a case by case basis. I sent this email though before I realised the travel advisory had changed to indefinitely. My travel insurance is covering change of dates for as long as the policy is in place.Cheers,Nat"
"Hi Nat, check out the Etihad website, covid 19 travel statement updated today. For flights scheduled before 30th June they are giving $400 plus 5000 Etihad guest miles when you save your trip for later. They are saying if you booked through an agent you will have to speak to them but their policies will still apply. Might be more ammunition to get a good discount for October."
"Thanks Chrissy, have just had a look on their website! Will try and contact best at travel tomorrow to see about hotel."
"i was just having a look around sites for proposed costs for oct /nov, i was shocked at the price hike , in some hotels in Oct they wanted near on 10k for two people over 10 nights , even the burj al arab never charged that, unless things change id take the credit note and look for next year as these prices could never continue as no one would book. the only one that seemed still pretty normal was the jebel ali resorts , but the other beach hotels esp jumeriah crazy prices even on their own web page as well."
"I suppose it depends on your circumstances. We usually travel to the UAE March/Apr and Oct/ Nov, the latter usually being more expensive from memory. We snapped our agents hands off when we were offered the same price to reschedule our March 25th trip to October as we would have booked for then anyway so we have saved around 40% on current prices. Prices may yet come down due to the current situation but who knows? If we were being charged extra then we would have probably accepted a credit note so long as it was guaranteed by abta but then another thing to consider is travel insurance and whether you would be insured for covid 19 for a new booking. We are still covered as our trip is considered as an amended booking and not a new one."
"Hi,Just wanted to say thanks for everyones help and information.we were unable to change dates to October half term as hotel would not let us, they said we could go up to 8th October, the first 2 weeks in December or move holiday to next year. We have decided to hopefully just change it to the same dates next year so May 2021. Was a bit worried about still not being able to go in October/not having the holiday we have paid for. And also it would mean taking daughter out of school. Hopefully things go back to normal and we will be able to enjoy the holiday in 2021! Thanks,Nat"
"@ Nico - sometimes the best option is the safest one, and you've made a wise choice. Truth be told, I don't think any hotel in Dubai - not even Burj Al Arab - can commit to being 'the same' as it would have been pre-COVID-19. Even before the pandemic, hotels were awfully struggling anyways so service cuts were always looming.Which hotel was it, care to tell?"
"Hi shaun, it was the new caesars resort bluewaters. We got such a good deal on it, the total holiday cost with flights was £2090 for the 3 of us for 11 nights half board with 6 alcohol drinks a day! So i would much rather change the date than have the refund and hopefully hVe a holiday to look forward too! Thanks,Nat"
"Hey Nat, oh cool - it's a great resort, and you'll surely love it. They've been offering some amazing promotions (or at least they were before COVID) so do try and haggle/negotiate any benefits closer to the time. Just keep an eye on the restaurants as it's likely there may be some closures/restrictions over the coming months whilst recovering and the numbers are bleak for Dubai restaurants in particular."
Will do thank you!
"Hi Nat, I think the way things are going next May seems a much safer bet. I'm a bit concerned about travelling in October to be honest but will make a decision nearer the time. I hope you get the same price as that was such a great deal, with drinks too! But as Shaun says, there should be some good hotel deals around when we are allowed to travel. Best wishes.Edited: 1:06 pm, May 22, 2020 "
"Thanks chrissie,The agent did say they were trying to make sure with the hotel that we get the same package we booked, so fingers crossed. He said the flights wont be a problem as Etihad want people to change them rather than have a refund, he just said we would unlikely be able to change the flights for Christmas time. Which is to be expected But we just decided to stick to next May half term again, as thats the time of year we usually go to dubai anyway. He did mention that some people where trying to move their holidays to July/August but he was trying to say to them that even if dubai was open to the UK and travel was allowed there may be a lot of restrictions in place, and like Shaun said, a lot of restaurants in the hotels might be closed etc. Hopefully if you cannot travel in October they will just let you change it to another date next year!"
"Hi everyone,I have finally had new dates agreed with best at travel to change holiday to next May. The hotel are honouring the price we paid for this year but our flights with Etihad are looking at £400 more in total. They said they can change the flights to Emirates for an extra £350 total to fly direct. I was just wondering if anyone else has had to pay extra to move their holiday? And do we just accept to pay the extra or if not cancel the booking? Thanks,Nat"
"@ Nat - I'd be tempted to ask them to clarify exactly why the flights have changed in cost - is it the fare cost, is if the 'fare basis' or is it charges?Lots of agents are trying it on and most just say 'oh the price has gone up' without evidence. Ask them to show you, not tell you. It could they are being genuine or it may be a grab.Whatever you do, don't cancel the booking. As a fallback, you always have the option (based on the case) to try to get them to refund you (or other avenues of redress).It may be the prices have gone up - though not sure why they would do because demand is certainly not rising. Emirates a while back was holding out more expensive fare basis (ie higher costs) but it could just be a blinking game. Whilst the airlines are flying presently on vastly reduced schedules, even those few flights that are going are still only going about 40% full."
"Hi Nat, Aren't Etihad allowing you to cancel and save till later together with up to $400 credit? Although might be worth considering changing to Emirates to avoid any complication with different restrictions from AD to Dubai. I am actually considering changing my October flights with Etihad to emirates (if fco advice changes) to avoid this but you would think that matters will have improved by next May. You got such a good deal with the hotel that it might be worth just hanging on a bit to see if flight prices come down.Unfortunately, it does seem that people are being asked to pay up more to move so I would do some research and comparisons and then approach BAT as Shaun says and ask for clarification re the price increase. If you tell them you are considering a refund they may be able to do a bit more."
"Thanks Shaun, I will email her back now and ask. I think the problem is we got a stupidly good deal with Etihad when we booked last year, the flights were around £800 for all 3 of us. I just checked sky scanner and emirates are around £1150 for the 3 of us."
"Thanks Chrissie, I would much prefer to fly into Dubai direct and realistically I think we would end up paying taxi fare from Abu Dhabi and back with travelling with a 7 year old. So need to factor in that expense."
"No worries Nic - yeah, chances are it was an agent-only fare, just like Emirates do with some of their Specials.Still, one has to compare oranges with oranges so to speak, if they can show you the fare basis (it's usually a single letter) that will indicate, or it could be they're uplifting the charges or something else altogether. Good luck!See that's the thing with Skyscanner etc. - they're not always comparing the same because a lof of them don't show the fare basis. Once you know the fare basis, you can then track down those cheapies far easier"
