"I have been reading some disturbing reviews of the Riu Montego Bay Hotel regarding guests being treated poorly based on the fact that they are Black (comparing their treatment to the better attitudes/service directed toward the White guests). I did notice that there was a widely varied opinion of the attitudes and treatment of the staff (some say they were treated as ""disturbances"", while others claimed ""the staff could not do enough to help!"" Is any of this race-based? Any insight would be appreciated."
Keep me posted about what you hear because we're going in June. Seems crazy though.
That doesn't sound like the Jamaica I know. hmm...I'd be interested in hearing more as well.Jamaica isn't known for it's racism..it's more known for it's classism....if that makes any sense.There's just some things in the Jcan culture that tourists will never understand...I've been involved with this place for the last 25 yrs and some of it I still don't understand. lol
"I really cant beleive that. I take some of the reviews with a grain of salt. You get someone saying bad service. Well is bad service ""slow"" service. Jamaican people do not do thing fast. If you have been there you know that. I guess that is just one example. Same as for reviews saying the rooms were dated. Really the resort is only a few years old. I even read one complaing about no room service. Did they not do their homework and know where they were staying?? If I read something over and over and over for example the beds are to firm Or we had a hard time getting reservations in the resturants I may take that into consideration but something I read one or two times I disregard. We are going in 6 weeks and I will keep my eye open and see how everyone is treated!"
"While racism in it's ugliest form isn't openly prevelent on the island, stereotyping is all the rage... Some (maybe even many) Jamaicans are of the mindset that the lighter your skin is, the more money you probably have and the easier it is to part you from it...I watched a (somewhat boring) movie with my husband and his family... In the air or something.... There's a scene where George clooney was explaining his logic behind choosing security lines at the airport, go with the lines with Asians, girl said that was racist, he said no, he's not racist, he stereotypes... It's faster :) my husband commented that that was a jamaican attitude right there ;)I can believe that someone who isn't feeling they are getting fair service and is accustomed to observing something like this could feel this way... I can also believe that the real colour the servers are seeing is green and if you are purple with pink spots but flashing some green, you'll get the service you want... Just my thoughtsChelle"
"I quickly read back through the first 8 pages of reviews, which goes back into February. I didn't see anything about race, but there sure were a lot of negatives. I must say, based on what I read, that I wouldn't even consider staying there.As for Chelle's post, years ago I had a conversation with a bartender. He commented that American blacks were generally viewed by Jamaicans in the resorts as ""cheap"" (bad tippers), and as having ""no respect""."
"Unfortunately, I have witnessed this type of action and heard complaints. Not at RIU but at another resort. So I can believe it happens at other resorts."
"Racism is alive and well in Jamaica. Not as bad as a few decades ago but I still experience it especially going back with a white husband. Once I declare I am with the big white guy, things get easier but cost more.For a while in Jamaica , if you are white you are alright, brown stick around, black go back. For the same reason as Americans, Jamaicans are viewed even worse. If you are a white tourist and being given the preferential treatment, you might not notice, why would you???.I was raised with racism in Jamaica, being darker was seen as a fault. I have experienced it going back as a tourist. For me it's like weed, it's there deal with it. They see color: black, white, brown, redbone (that's color toooo)"
"yes, that's sort of what i was trying to get at... it's not really racism but ""colourism"" i guess for lack of a better word... my daughter is mixed and has long (tall) soft hair... within her first day of school in Jamaica at age 6 she experienced more ""racism/colourism"" and favourtism than she ever had in her life... she had groups of ""friends"" who idolized her because of her hair (more so than her complexion) and groups who despised her because of it... all before she even opened her mouth and they found out she was VERY foreign lol... kids will be kids and they always have very simple views of the world they live in and have no qualms expressing it, but they don't just come by the mentality by nature, it's a nurtue issue, so there are a lot of ""racial"" ideals that are still propogated extensively.... but i digress... the ""racism"" or stereotyping experienced in hotels/visitor areas is of a much different variety and is very much associated with the colour green and typically not much else... those who are really observant will pick up that not every caucassian person gets treated the same either.... servers are quite astute at remembering the faces of those who tip :) ""racism"" that exists in jamaica in general is more based on that ""classist"" mentality above... and the attitude toward lighter skinned people as ""higher class""... then, on the other hand, you have the modern day backlash to this, where the ""white devil"" mentality exists... i've experienced this in isolated pockets both in bush and in town... in fact the more militant (the old-school, which *some* even call ""truest"") form of rastafarian practices tends to lean in this direction.... Ah Jamaica.......ChelleEdited: 9 years ago "
"Whatever the correct term, I know based on your skin color you can be treated differently. My hubby did not notice this at first. It's sad but almost comical seen it in play. I get to the airport and they are getting ready to give me the third degree then I say, I am with 'whitey'. Now I get, no problem mon, welcome to Jamaica. Now I am at the Raatid stage with other '""claat' coming to mind. Growing up the much darker child in Jamaica has prepared for living with ease in the US. To this day some still refer to me as the pretty but dark one who did good by getting herself a white man....lol!I worked as a waitress so I can relate to certain groups less or more likely to tip:-)Edited: 9 years ago "
"If you are black (what ever 'ism' it is) one way to guarantee to get the same treatment as the whites is to show some green. Yes, this goes for Couples and because you did not see it or experience it, doesn't mean it's not there.Why can the bartenders remember my hubby's favorite drinks in alphabetical order but forget I love creamy White Russians:-). We walk up together and not the lovely lady but 'bossmon' as he is called get served first. Ah Jamaica, the place is laced with beauty but sometimes buried in ugly."
"""beauty unsurpassed... and ugliness that could make a rat puke""that line stuck with me for some reason :) Chelle"
"My sister and I are black Americans with brown complexions. We have never gotten any type of negative responses in the three trips we've taken to Jamaica (we'll be back again in about 6 weeks). In fact it seems that they go out their way to assist us. What I have seen; people of all colors acting rudely towards staff members without any regard for their feelings. The workers, particularly the bartenders, are serving you, they're not your servants. Please treat people how you want to be treated and you in turn will receive pleasant service with a smile."
"ChelleToday I was reading about the bleaching epidemic in Jamaica. Scary, but now it's being lighter/whiter at any cost.Edited: 9 years ago "
"The term I think some of you are looking for is ""shadism."" Regardless of the perception abroad, brownings have always (well, for as long as I can remember - and prior that, and my family will testify) been viewed as being somewhat more socially mobile than their darker-skinned counterparts. I personally disagree with the classism argument because shadism has far more to do with expressed phenotype, and little to do with socio-economic background. My son's mother is from Dunkirk and is of mixed heritage (father Jamaican black/mother Russian/Austrian) and was a poorist like, duh, many in the area. She's quite aware that many were attracted to her because of her complexion, and I suppose enjoyed certain...ancillary benefits. I'm from I suppose a more middle class family with a regular ""light brown"" complexion, and experienced similar sentiments but for obviously different reasons, and from different sources. While playing tourist at various resorts, I notice that many on staff typically reciprocate the attitudes that they receive, regardless of ethnicity. That's my experience, however - yet I tend to think that if people are courteous and kind wherever they go (speaking of hotels and resorts), they will typically receive the same in return.Edited: 9 years ago "
There are many resorts that are not local friendly. Perhaps these observations being commented on are somehow related to that and the staff in question do not make the distinction between black Americans and locals.

hi from nj.i stayed at the Riu in montego bay the only incident that hapened to me was when i was offered a ride by one of the young guys that work for the riu i believe he was a bellhop i am not sure he might have been a taxi driver he had a uniform on so i thought it was safe i was going to the i forget swiming where it was cllearer then the rui anyway i gave him the 20 plus a 5 dolar tip he said do you want me to pick you up at a certain time i was hesitate but he insisted anyway i left early because it started raining and got another cab same thing 20 plus a 5 tip well this young man was where is always is right by the door he sees me and says hey i was just there trying to get you and you go with someone else and shouted rudely you at least oew me 10 dollars i was not happy but still didnt report him i was just pissed i didnt like being treated like a ragmuffin .it made me feel very uneasy.cindy
"Kenetic,Both classism and shadism exist in Jamaica."
"Kenetic,Both classism and shadism exist in Jamaica.*********Yes, they both do. There was an interesting article about Jcan's bleaching themselves to get lighter. :( Very sad"
Vybz Kartel has been on the news a lot lately about his bleaching. Yes I did notice some articles on the weekend about bleaching (yet to read !).
my dh was joking that we need to start carrying bleaching cream and fake hair...two things that sell like hotcakes down here.
"Racism, by definition, is the belief that your race is superior to another race....so Blacks cannot be ""racist"" towards other Blacks. They can, however, treat them differently on account of a number of factors (manners, attitude, perceived cash flow, etc.) This ""colorism""/""shadism"" some of you have posted of has its roots in slavery. Many times, white masters would impregnate their Black slaves, creating lighter-skinned offspring, and those children received preferential treatment around the plantation/compound. For example, they'd be given work in the house, which was thought to be more delicate in nature, than out doing back-breaking work in the fields. This ""system"" has obviously persisted through to today, which is obviously beyond sad.I can say with certainty that I have never been treated unfairly in Jamaica because of my skin color. In fact, I believe I've received preferential treatment from Jamaicans on a number of occasions...being a fellow West Indian and all. This holds true for my experiences all over the Caribbean and in Africa, as well. Many Blacks--in this case, Jamaicans, have a ""you're one of us"" attitude about other Blacks, and the treatment can go either way: you either get extra special attention because of this or you get less attention because they feel you're not a true tourist, and therefore don't require the bells and whistles ""real"" tourists get. And on the note of some resorts not being local-friendly....my hunch is that they operate that way to give tourists an air of safety.Edited: 9 years ago "

"Okay, first off I am white as is my wife. So this is based solely on what I've seen been told, or read. Our first trip was in 1985. We met a black couple that we ran around wi th. When we stopped it wss ""brother this"" and ""sister that"", much more hassle than we got. Trying to shame them into giving money. Years later at a different resort there was a black family we got close to. One afternoon there was a blck couple that exploded at the bartender for favoring whites. I asked the guy we knew if it he felt like he was discriminated against and he said no he was treated well that the couple complaining had been rude to the bartenders. Maybe 3 years ago a woman wrote on this forum about being discriminated against because she was with a black Jamaica boyfriend. I sent her a pm and when she responded they were at the same resort at the same time I was there. Her boyfiend was always drunk and wanted to fight everyone. He told whites they had no right to be in his country (he lived in Canada). He accused the hotel workers of being sellouts. When the night manager intervened he wanted to fight him. The guards had to restrain him. Cleary the last 2 examples related to lack of respect toward the local Jamaicans. The first case was that Jamaicans expect a little more empathy from from blacks.I read a book years ago that stated that Jamaicans consider light skin a sign of intelligence. In the days of slavery the half black kids of the slave owner would normally give them their freedom and set them up in a small business. Light skin blacks were the original middle class, whites upper class, and blacks lower class. The early prime ministers were all light skinned.  Even people like Butch Stewart, who grew up poor to middle class, are light skinned. Did he have an easier time getting set up in business because of skin color? For tourist, black or white, the thing to remember is Jamaicans want to be treated with respect. If you give it you will receive it. If you don't give respect, then don't expect much."
"From knowing many of the people that work in the tourist industry and at the hotels, there is unfortunately a stereotype amoung the workers with black americans. i've been told (from the staff) that black americans are much more demanding, rude and treat the workers as if they are ""below them"" and do not tip. Sounds really bad, yes, but that is the unfortunate stereotype that is put on black americans, i've heard this several times from several different workers.As l_renfro mentioned above - i completely agree...For tourist, black or white, the thing to remember is Jamaicans want to be treated with respect. If you give it you will receive it. If you don't give respect, then don't expect much."
"It was interesting to read what Chell00 and MustBestTripping had to say. They did get it right but I will add my two cents.  Wasn't the RIU the hotel with all the Spanish speaking workers from DR, Mexico and Spain? Were these the people who were showing racist tendencies to black guests or were they local Jamaicans? This was not explained. I am quite sure that a lot of people who have travelled would have an idea what people of Spanish decent and Mexicans look like? Could it be a result of all the negative things that are said about black people in the media? I am from Trinidad and we have dozens of shades of brown because of the history of the island. Some people used to feel that if they were white or fair skinned and had straight hair that they were better than people who were dark skinned and vice versa; maybe there are still a few ignorant ones who still feel that way– we call that slavery day’s mentality. Today, education, professions and financial success have knocked out a lot of those stupid attitudes. No sense in being fair and you don’t have a good education and a good job, it gets you nowhere. You cannot get that big job and big house honestly without a certificate in your hand. I am of a mixed race. I was brought up with every race under the rainbow and learned from early that you respect people for their character and honesty and nothing else. As a result, I probably got more respect. Class, social status and money also have a lot to do with preferential treatment in Trinidad and I believe in most of the West Indian islands. Jamaica has such a large black skinned population so I guess things may not be so bad when coming to the colour of the skin. So when Black Americans or black people visit some of those resorts, I am assuming that the staff who may have problems with their race and suffer from inferiority complexes may feel that the black people should be treated in any old way. After all that is what America preaches daily? No respect for the President. Some people also resent the idea that another black person is doing well and purposely finds a way to try to feel superior by treating you without respect, IF you allow it. Is it really racism, or is it jealously, envy and spite or a deep routed inferiority complex? From my two visits to Jamaican resorts and I can tell you I did not stay in a 5 star, I did notice the servitude attitude to white guests. Was I annoyed? No. I felt sorry for staff members who behaved in this manner. I am paying even more as a solo traveller because I have to pay a single supplement and you are sucking up to the person who paid less than I did. So I would not say it is racism. It is because they think that the white guests are rich and the black guests are poor. They also have such an inferiority complex which was imbedded in them from childhood and it has never left them so they just don’t know how to treat and respect people equally. I usually bring gifts with me and I try to tip at every meal except breakfast. I have found that the men seem to be more professional than the woman. I have gotten a puffed face look from a few of the waitresses. Do I care, no, because I am enjoying myself. It is a cultural thing that comes from a certain segment of the population. On the other hand lack of education sometimes distorts one’s mind and this is something that you will find everywhere in the world. But to say it is the kind of racism in Jamaica like the type you have in North America, I would say “No”. It accounts for many suitcases of baggage that they are carrying around in their head. So go ahead and enjoy your vacation. As they would say ""Respect Mon"". You give it, you will get it back.Edited: 9 years ago "
"I forgot to mention the following,as the two reviewers before me wrote. Now I will say something in reverse. Some black Americans and Americans have displayed a lot of superiority attitudes when travelling and have gotten a bad rap. I don't know if it because Americans have always been told that they live in the best country in the world. But try to remember that people are just like you, whether they are rich, poor, black, yellow or white, we all have the same feelings. You respect them and they will respect you. Would you like to go to your job and you are treated badly?. No. Unfortunately Americans are getting a bad rap because of those who throw their weight around. I know that there was a group of the black Americans at one of the resorts where I stayed and were always very loud and disturbing in the dining room. They acted as if they were in the park having a picnic., They left their tables piled with food and on the whole not one of them ever looked in my direction for the week and I was black. Not that I was looking for friends, I was not, but not a good morning. So if they treat the staff like that what do you think will happen? On the other hand when other races get drunk and loud their behaviour is no better. I hope that my comments will help people to understand the different races and act in a certain manner in their future travels."
There is both racism and class divisions in Jamaica. Some people are biased against black and some people are biased against white. Other people don't see colour and they are the ones I choose to associate with. Class divisions are much wider in scope and deeply entrenched in the island's culture... and have little to do with colour...far more to do with connections and power. Doubt if that will ever change.
"It is not specific to Riu, all resorts have to deal with it with some degree . Depending on the education level etc of staff or rural or urban orgin of staff. If one looks at the history of tourism in Jamaica, Jamaica was very expensive and for many years tourist were old white people who visited in winter. Blacks, Hispanics etc are relatively new to Jamaican tourism and many Jamaicans still have this concept. If you ask Jamaicans who are tourist. Most will say white people who come from foreign.In the resort context in Jamaica, I would say the racism is based on tips. Some resort workers believe white people tip better, black people are cheap etc. Similarly, some Europeans/British people are considered to be mean and are treated differently by some resort workers. When slavery existed in Jamaica there was a hierarchy among slaves. The lighter of the African slaves were put in the houses to do less strenuous work, house cleaning, tea making etc. They considered better than the field slaves who were considered inferior and work in the fields. Later in slavery into abolition these lighter blacks were given land, education etc where field or dark slaves were not given opportunities. These systems of belief still exist in the psyche of some Jamaicans. It is not Black/White, but Black is divided into many different shades as well as hair texture etc. People compare who is browner and have pretty hair. It used to be up to the 90s and even now in some cases. Anyone with even a lighter complexion went to better school, got better jobs; owned land had a better life. The belief still exists and many dark people bleach their skins combining many dangerous chemicals to their faces to be a lighter shade of black.Edited: 9 years ago "
"""and for many years tourists were old white people who visited us in winter""...not so. Tourism began in Jamaica with the wealthy and famous. It had nothing to do with old white people.And white people prefer brown as well. They lie out for hours in the sun to tan to a perfect shade of brown exposing themselves in the process to dangerous rays. They also mess with their hair...straight wants to be curly and curly wants to be straight. It is a people issue not a race issue.Also, as an aside, the vendors i Fern Gully prefer black tourists. They say they buy ore. So it is really a matter of personal experience rather than cold, hard fact..."
"okay... i can't get the picture of an old white lady gasping in shock and running away in near tears over the art that fern gully is known for... i'd say that's not their typical customer at all.... i imagine most won't even get out of the bus... hehehei know there are other vendors there lol... as i said, mental image... just can't get it out of my head.... ;) Chelle"
"Actually, I didn't mean the wood carvers:) I sometimes give a ride to the vendors higher up who sell t-shirts, etc., and they are the ones that tell me that black tourists buy more things from them. Never checked with the wood carvers although I see plenty of white people getting their photos taken beside their larger pieces:) Even old ladies.Edited: 9 years ago "
"I must say this has turned out to be a history lesson.""It used to be up to the 90s and even now in some cases. Anyone with even a lighter complexion went to better school, got better jobs; owned land had a better life"".In Trinidad, free high school education was introduced in 1957 by Eric Williams and his PNM party, which lost their power to an Indian Government last year. They also lost their power for 4 years a few years ago but regained it at the next election. Before 1957, the schools that had the fairer people were the Catholic high schools and some of their elementary schools but that did not really exclude black people but they went there because they were Catholics. The fairer skins did feel that they were superior because some of the slavery mentality was still there. Once free high school education was introduced and the government controlled all of the schools, your entry was gained by passing the high school common entrance examination, which had nothing to do with colour but the brains in your head and believe it or not that is when the majority of Trinidad Indians started to really get their high school education. I am not saying that in Trinidad, the private firms and banks did not practice the colour concept but the blacks were the most educated and they worked in all of the government sectors, hospitals and schools. The Indians were the farmers then. The whites are the ones who were members of the country club and did things like golfing, yatching, etc. Today, Trinidad paints a completely different picture except for yatching. Black people are not interested in buying yatchs. Now you will find that there is another problem. Anyone who is W.I. and aware of the present politics of Trinidad would know what I am talking about. I never realized that Jamaica with such a predominent black population had this sort of thing still happening to that extent up to the 90's. This is good to know. I am hoping to go to JA in the fall and I will understand things better and know why I am not the bell of the ball :) :). Service people surely need to be reducated. I know that they depend on tips but they may lose out by treating the wrong person in an inappropriate manner. Looks could be deceiving. In the Caribbean, we all have beaches to go to and unless we are going to the Univ. of the West Indies, a job contract or marriage, we usually head to a nearby island, North America, Canada and UK and even Europe for our vacation instead of Jamaica. Most of us in Canada prefer to go to Cuba, Mexico, U.S., Europe or back home, so most of the Black tourists to Jamaica are really Americans and I guess the British.."
"Another form of racism is among different descendants. India was a colony of Britain when slavery was abolished. When enslaved the Africans were freed, thousands of Indians came to Jamaica on paid contracts to work on the sugar plantations to replace the enslaved. Most remained at the end of their contract and received a parcel of land; some went into buying and selling etc. The Indians had claimed superiority since they were not slaves and were paid and there are some deep rooted differences between both groups. Especially since both groups have competed for the few resources available then .The racism is not bad anymore especially due to interracial marriages, but there are a few hiccups from time to time. In Jamaica, when someone of Indian descent uses the N word, the other person will use the word “coolie” which is its equivalent."

"I am gong save some of these posts. I want to really digest. It is obvious that people of the Caribbean had one thing in common, British, Dutch, Spanish or Portuguese slave masters but the history of each island is completely different. A friend of mine always corrects me when I say in the ""West Indies"" we do this and that. She always says to me name the island because the history and lifestyles (in a way) are different. I think I have to agree with her."
"I forgot, the French, because we also have the French West Indies. Many languages, cuisines, traditions and customs; that is what the Caribbean is all about."
This is a very hilarious topic to be honest. It is hilarious because racism exists in every part of the world not just in Jamaica obviously. I have been to almost a dozen countries and have been discriminated against albeit only subtly. I remember going to a particular spanish-speaking Caribbean island and it was as if i didn't even exist at the hotel. Funny enough I met some great folks outside of the hotel and even went to their house for dinner. As it relates to Jamaica-i am not even going to keep my head in the sand. In many hotels white people ARE treated better than non-whites. I remember going to Jamaica Grande with my wife last year and we vowed never to return because of the poor service we got. The resort staff were downright rude to us. I was even basically run from the gazebo by one of the Supervisors. My cousin was staying at Sandals Ocho Rios and he came to visit me in the lobby. He was told that he couldn't be there for more than 5 minutes. Ironically I went to visit him the next day and I was allowed all over the property. The point to all of this is that some Jamaican discriminate and others clearly do not. I had a wonderful time at Merrils in Negril. Whenever I am there the staff is so helpful and they dont care that I am Jamaican. I get the same kind of treatment as everyone else.
""" It is hilarious because racism exists in every part of the world not just in Jamaica obviously""I am Jamaican and find nothing funny about COLORISM, which has been pointed out is not the same as RACISM. If you are darker, as I am, in a place like Jamaica you will be treated different starting in your own family based on that fact. Oh, good time to mention about having 'good and pretty' hair, not nappy is a major plus.I have dealt with COLORISM in Jamaica and RACEISM in America. I prefer the later, if one has to choose. It's one thing not to be accepted by others but when it's your own it can be heartbreaking starting as a child!We laugh at different things:-)Edited: 9 years ago "

Merci, merci, mercy!Edited: 9 years ago "
"The carvings at the foot of Fern Gully have been en eyesore that the residents of Ocho Rios (most of us anyway) have been trying to get rid of for years. I drive up Fern Gully almost every day (when it isn't closed that is) and feel saddened everyt ime I pass those tasteless carvings that this is the image that is presented at the foot of one of the most beautiful stretches of road imaginable. I, like others, can laugh at the tourists who choose to have their photograph taken beside them (and evenpay money for the opportunity to do so) but it really isn't funny.Representations of nudity, as in Michaelangelo's David can be beautiful They can also be very ugly.And getting back to racism in Jamaica (not specifically at the Riu) ...it goes both ways unfortunately. Racists come in every colour and every shade."
"“This is a very hilarious topic to be honest. It is hilarious because racism exists in every part of the world not just in Jamaica obviously”. I thought we were talking about Jamaica and I feel that everyone is intelligent to know that we are talking about black people treating other black people with no respect while they suck up others on their job when everyone is paying for a service. This does not make it hilarious. It is their job and we are paying for it.When I wrote in this forum I did not think of racism in other parts of the world. What came to my mind is what the original post was all about. I have travelled to some of the other W.I. islands including Cuba and Mexico and even to the same places on many occasions and I was always treated like any other guest at restaurants, hotels or resorts. My observation in Jamaica was at the two 3-star resorts where l stayed and as usual had to pay $300 more as a solo traveller was that I was not treated the same way as the guests of another race. The worst were the bartenders; they seem to act as if they were doing me a favour. Not once with the exception of one person did anyone ever ask me if I was enjoying my stay. After all, I always thought the resorts were there to make sure that their guests felt comfortable as most guests were staying there for a week or two. The waiters and waitresses assigned to the tables where I sat served me and were attentive, yes, I did tip them and I always tried to sit in the same section, the maids who cleaned my room were respectful to me, yes, I brought them gifts and they got a tip daily. I am referring to any other staff like the entertainment crew, the bartenders, some of the front desk and a very rude head chef who thought that I should not ask why the desserts were removed from the dining room when some of us were still eating. They are the people who intermingle more with the guests and they seem to be the ones who have a problem. They need to be re-educated to learn what the hotel industry is all about and what they are supposed to do. You can act that way outside of your job and that would be your personal choice but not when you are on your job. It did not bother me because I have travelled a lot so instead I felt sorry for them, I also wondered how much travelling they have done and if they have ever lived outside of Jamaica. I have lived most of my life in a Canada so I know the meaning of racism but when you come to a black country as a black tourist to spend your vacation in a hotel that you are paying to stay, there should be no preferential treatment to another race. People wrote how they felt and what they know and have experienced and I think that a lot of intelligent things were said. I think it is time for me to brush up on my Spanish and head back to my two favourite places where the people seem to be more professional.Edited: 9 years ago "
"As I posted before racism does exist in Jamaica whether in the hotels or outside of them. We have all experienced it whatever clour we are and whether it is black to white, white to black, black to black or white to white (or similar examples involving Asians and Chinese). Better to deal with it and ignore the racists. Worrying about it or complaining only gives them power"
"Yes, racism and clorism exist in Jamaican. However majority of the whites on this forum will claim otherwise because it doesn't affect them for the week they are there, or they are too blind or indifferent to see it.They are completely ignorant to the fact tipping might be the only way to balance the scale if you are black and want the same treatment at places likes Couples and Sandals. Tomorrow they will quote guidelines, like gospel, not knowing what is said, expected or done is completely different.As for nudity, I really don't see much about the human body as ugly, wood or flesh. Michelangelo did his version with David and the Jamaicans did their version of the BIG BAMBOO. The only difference I see is size and the material used. Who would believe if a Jamaican did a wood version of of ""little"" David. Just sayin:-))))"
"I personaly experienced racism at the RIU Hotel in 2008. I was apart of a group of about 20 persons from work. On arriving at the hotel we were told that we arrived before check in time and so we had to wait in the lobby. It was later that we realized that one of our group members who was german had already started to enjoy some of the hotel's facilities.The service just went down hill from there. THe staff at the front desk made us feel like a burden the one time that my room mate and I went to speak to them. There were only two persons that gave excellent service and they were from housekeeping. I wasnt trying to imagine it, I saw the difference in service towards the jamaicans. After that I went to Breezes and Couples San Souci and they both were wondeful."
"I have been to 5 different resorts in Jamaica with a white husband of almost 20 years: Couples, Beaches, Sunset Jamaica Grande, Sunset at the Palms and Sunset Beach and Spa. At one point during our stay I noticed something that caused me to think WTF!Being Jamaican and a bit embarrassed, I did not bring it to his attention for years. He knew that Jamaican custom favors the white tourist our the returning ex-pats. I would always let him go first and tag behind him like a puppy. He could get away with taking the kitchen sink in the nothing to declare line, while I got my $5 pocketbook from Walmart searched. On the other hand he was always charged more for everything. The underlying assumption of white, meat on the bones, and American also meant rich. Being with the 'rich' guy meant I also got charged more because as they (my beloved Jamaicans) would say, I am one of 'them'. Ok, to be fair some members of my family think that as well, marrying white means marrying rich. JAMAICA IS WHAT IT IS, A PLACE LACED WITH BEAUTY, LAUGHTER, WEED, VIBE, BUT BURIED IN ALL KINDS OF DOO-DOO!Edited: 9 years ago "
"Lol!!...you're too funny, MBT!!....you have such a way with words!"
MBT...you definitely have a grasp on the reality that is Jamaica. Our motto: Don't let the doo doo get you down:)
"When we are in Jamaica, I often take my friends little girl aged 4 to the beach. On one occasion we had another friend come along and he brought his boy of the same age. the children had a lovely time playing together and as we left they hugged each other. I made a flippant comment about young romance and the father of the boy became very defensive, saying his son would never go with some like her because she was 'so dark ' . !!"
@animalhousejamaica. You hit the nail right on the head. It makes no sense giving power to the racist people by playing into their racism and going to cry and hide under a rock. REAL Jamaicans learn how to laugh and smile in the face of adversity. I have been discriminated against so many times both in Jamaica and abroad that I have lost count. My response was to LAUGH at those people because I know they are ignorant. Most of the other posters only read the first part of my post and clearly did not the rest of what I have to say. And just for the record not only black people are discriminated against in Jamaica. All different types of races so no need to feel that black people have a lien on discrimination.
"@Ginger3556. I would love to know which resorts you went to in Cuba and Mexico. I have been to Cuba, Mexico and DR on numerous occasions either on vacation or on official business trips. The first time I was in Havana the waiter at the hotel did not even want to serve me. I just shrugged it off and took a walk near the Malecon where I found this wonderful lady who operated a restaurant downstair her house. She was very pleasant and was very interested in knowing about Jamaica. I later became very good friends with her and her son. However while visiting numerous places around Cuba and Mexico I had the feeling that I wasn't welcomed. I say it again-racism and colourism whatever the heck you want to call it exist in EVERY country and among EVERY race. Don't feed into it. If you are smart you will laugh it off like me and move on. Jamaicans have an incredible way of adjusting and laughing in the face of adversity. You all should take a page."
"This is very sad for a country that has a 90.9% black population. People always ask me why I like Mexico and Cuba. I like Cuba because there is so much history and the tours are so educational and the country is surely beautiful. The people working in the tourist industry are very professional and try to respect everyone. I guess it is because the Cuban government know how important the industry is for the survival of the people and the country and they train them well. Mexico is my second love. I was just there for two weeks in a small hotel on the beach in a village that was almost empty during the low season. Beautiful place on the beach, lovely 1 bedroom suite. I liked the idea that I could go down to the jetty to pick up fish straight from the boat when the fishermen came in. No hassles from anyone. My friends thought that I was crazy. I have always gotten so much respect from the Mexicans. They befriend me so easily not expecting one penny and I have not seen any type of begging while I have been there on my three trips. Just the shop keepers and restaurant workers at their doorways, asking you if you need anything. Why I mention this is because as I have mentioned before I am shocked that this sort of thing is happening in a country with a 90.9% black population when we have progressed so much as a race and have accomplished so much. The only reason that I am planning to go back to Jamaica this year is to see a few of my close friends, otherwise, there would be no reason for me to go back there. It surely has many elements to it that one would not have to encounter in some of the other Caribbean islands. It was nice reading your posts but I have guests coming in next week, so I say goodbye to TA for awhile."
"@alimirage: I just realized that you had a post addressed to me. ""I do not DISAGREE with what you and others said. I am quite aware of all that is going on in the world but sometimes we have to be honest and say what we think, this is what Tripadviser is all about. Experiences in travel and as a result, one would write many things that are relevant to get their point across. I don't have a problem and I am not FEEDING into it. To answer your other question. I am a solo traveller and as a result, I do not stay in 5 star hotels because I can't afford to and to me the big resorts do not let me get the feel of the country that I am visiting. I do speak a little bit of Spanish and I must honestly admit that I have never had any problems or bad experiences in Cuba, for a matter of fact I have had people overextend themselves to me there and as a result I have had the greatest love for Cuban people. Since Cubans are now allowed to stay at the resorts, on my first day of my last visit, the waitresses thought that I was Cuban although I am not fair and greeted me in Spanish before realizing that I was not Cuban so maybe I have a Cuban look, I don't know. So to answer your questions here are the places that I have stayed in Mexico. Royal Decameron, Bucerias, North of Puerto Vallarta; I have stayed at two places south of Cancun: Hotel Del Agua, Puerto Morelos (I would not stay there again, I saw it in October and the owner has allowed the property to become uninviting) and I stayed at a small hotel) called Arrecifes Suites in Puerto Morelos. The two hotels mentioned had kitchens so that gave me the opportunity to go shopping and doing my own cooking. In Cuba, I have stayed a Hotel Villa Cuba in Varadero, a resort; In Havana I stayed in the suburb of Miramar at a hotel called Hotel Comorodo. I have not been reading the greatest reviews for the later for some time now. I also stayed at Blau Colonial, Cayo Coco and Brisas Guadalavaca, Guadalavaca/Holquin. The Cuban places where I stayed were all 4 stars. Sorry to hear about your experience in these two countries, my experiences were different."
"I guess that sums it up. Every person's experience is different. We have to respect that. Jamaica has as many professional hotel workers (who are not ractists) as any other island or country. Is there racism here? Of course there is and as previous noted it involves every race as both perpetrator and victim. My philosophy, as also previously noted, is to ignore it. Yes, it can hurt. and (in my experience) can be very intense, but the next person you encounter will have a completely different and very positive attitude towards you and those are the people that are worth your time."
"""Every person's experience is different.""This is so true even for people you are traveling with. There were times I was huffing and puffing when my hubby had this big grin on his face for getting his drink first, in alphabetical order, while I waited for my Sex on the Beach with a White Russian. I was ready to b1tch slap everyone including him:-). Now I whisper a word of prayer and think tomorrow they are going to overcharge your white azz. Traveling as a Canadian ( I have a nice t-shirt with the maple leaf ) your experience is also different. The assumption of wealth is not as bad."
"to baltimore luv..i totally agree.i have been living in spain for the past 18 years.in the beginning curiosity was the norm here but for some people they couldn't work at what race i was.when i told them that i was english but of jamaican parentage ...wow! was the 1st reaction .they assumed that a black person was jet black and for the youngsters wow,..jamaaiicaaaaa! it was and still is paradise to them.what i'm trying to say is that it doesn't matter what colour,class,creed or religion you belong to,respect as well as politeness knows no bounderies!!"
"We are going to Riu TP next week. Will see whats in store for us. I am an Asian Indian. I have noticed one thing that, when I stay in resorts and get into the pool, many white people leave. It is funny, but an advantage. We have the pool for ourselves. When it comes to staff, i get mixed treatment. Best thing is to smile, act professional. Hey its your vacation. As Lady Bird said "" Nobody can me let me down unless I let them"". Usually I dont tip for first couple of days, but take a note of who give good service selflessly. On the last day, I tip them generously and also patronize them or use their service more often.Edited: 9 years ago "
"I have been in Jamaica a long, long time and been at - or stayed at - almost every hotel on the island. Never, ever have I seen any white person (let alone white ""people"" get out of a pool because an ""Asian Indian"" got in.Do hate it when such rubbish is posted."
lol... no one would leave the pool due to one's race. Maybe there is another reason???
"""I have noticed one thing that, when I stay in resorts and get into the pool, many white people leave. There is more to this story, me thinks. People on this forum have repeatedly told me or implied that I was lying about my experience in Jamaica, because it was not lily white like theirs. I am not going to go that to you but half the story has never been told."
"As I have said repeatedly on this thread...racism exists on this island - in all forms. However, people do not get out of pools when others get in because of race...as suggested by cebakes there must be another reason.I am sure we have all had our experiences with racism whatever colour we may be. We can let it affect us or not - our choice. If someone is so ignorant that he/she doesn't like me because of my colour that is their problem and definitely not mine.Edited: 9 years ago "
"To be fair to swamyb, he/she did not say that this had happened to him/her in Jamaica. Perhaps he/she could provide us with some more details?"
If anybody chooses to get out of the pool that is their business. They are paying for their vacation and they deserve to enjoy it anyway they see fit.
"""However, people do not get out of pools when others get in because of race""But they will beat, torture and even murder because of race. Let's all head to the beach or at least the swim-up bar. The poster said he spent time in Hawaii."
This is the first time I will be in Jamaica. I apologize sincerely if I have hurt anybody's feelings. I will be in Jamaica this Sunday for a week and looking forward to have great time. Thats all matters to me.
"""But they will beat, torture and even murder because of race""...yes people have done this to all races. But that wasn't the topic being addressed. People getting out of the pool was.SwamyB was not referring to Jamaica it seems. Wondering then why the comment was even made in this forum."
"My friends have gone north so I am checking in. I am surprised that this forum is still going.SwamyB: when you come back let us know if people got out of the pool in Jamaica because you are Indian. Which country were you in when this happened and what were the ratings of these resorts? I know that when I first came to Toronto, and in those days sometimes being the only black on the bus or train, no one would sit next to me, but long gone are those days. Every race is here now. And I actually doubt that white people would get out of a pool because you are in it and that this will actually happen in Jamaica. At least, I would hope that this will not take place. Was there more to your story? Were you behaving in a rowdy and disgusting manner? Seems strange that white people would all leave the pool because you were Indian and in the pool. If you told me that they ignored you and did not speak to you, that is O.K. I sometimes don't speak to people either.Edited: 9 years ago "
"Just curious why people are skeptical about swamyb's reports??? Were there not LAWS in several countries separating races in all sorts of facilities (busses, restaurants, schools, water fountains, and yes, pools, etc.) because ""some"" people were repulsed by the thought of sharing those facilities with people of other races?? Not implying that Jamaica was one of those countries (as swamyb has also reported, this did NOT happen in Jamaica), but it does not strike me as at all strange that some people may still have this attitude.Edited: 9 years ago "
"SwamyB: I forgot to add this. Did you check the time of the day? Was it near a meal time? People leave a pool for various reasons. Time to eat, time to get dressed because they have to go out, time to get some rest to get ready for dinner and the night's event or time to head to another part of the resort for whatever reason. Sometimes, we can't jump to conclusions because we are not white. People of our same race do things and we sometimes get very suspicious of their actions but it may not always be what we think. I have lived in a white country most of my life and they surely don't get up because I am around so this one is a bit strange to me and that is why I question where did this happen. I hope you enjoyed your stay in Jamaica. Love and peace to all my TA writers. I hope to meet some of you one day in my travels.Edited: 9 years ago "
"LuxT: I am sure that SwamyB were not going to resorts and posh hotels when those laws were in place. How long has apartheid in South Africa ended and how long has America changed those types of laws? These two countries were the biggest culprits. I am quite sure they were not not on the guest lists then. These laws have been changed for some time now. Resorts have not been around that long. And if they were in a place where there were such laws, they would not have been allowed to stay in those places; they would have been told that the hotel or resort was full.Edited: 9 years ago "
"Ginger,I'm well aware of when apartheid in South Africa ended and when ""civil rights"" were extended in the U.S. My point is that despite the reversal of those laws, the ATTITUDE behind those laws still prevails among some people. Racism and overt discrimination in both the above countries are still very much alive and kickin' so, again, my confusion was related to why people were skeptical that swamyb's report of people leaving the pool was so far-fetched."
"As I have repeatedly noted on this thread - and I note it again because factual information is important to me - in over thirty years in Jamaica and with time spent at almost every hotel on the island, I have never, ever seen anyone getting out of any pool because someone of another colour got in. Nor have I ever heard of this. It just doesn't happen here.Racists are to be found everywhere, in every country of the world, and directed towards every colour. That will probably always be the case because people of small minds tend never to open them. We, the victims, however, can change OUR attitude towards them. Once you do that it becomes irrelevant.Edited: 9 years ago "
"Looks like my comment stirred a hornet's nest. People, I never said anything about racism. I just said it was funny, people would leave, so that we had the pool for ourselves. The pools were adequate and maybe there was a reason like it is best to leave to accomodate other. Only thing I saw were white people, if black people or Chinese people were there, I would have said the same thing about them leaving. Coming to Jamaica and racism, what I experienced was not racism, but a popular notion that white people are best. I made many friends in Jamaica and people are friendly. If I go to a resort in India, and there were white people, they get the preference over me. Because the belief is White people tips better. I don't know if that is true or not, but I have obeserved that by the way staff's attitude towards me and with white people. I do tip only to encourage selfless service. I don't buy artifical service with money, but reward genuine service.This will be my last post here.. thanks"
I have to answer that post...I am told by many vendors that they prefer black Americans because they tip the best. I guess everyone has their preference. And people in service industris tend to go after the tips wherever they may be.So it a go. There is no popular notion on this island that white people are best. That is just nonsense.
"""I am told by many vendors that they prefer black Americans because they tip the best""This might be true while on Jamaica. However working as a waitress, in the US for years, the only tippers worse than black Americans were Jamaicans. Tippingly speaking, if I was presented with 3 tables and these 3 groups, make NO MISTAKE which one I would choose. A girl gotta eat. Make no mistake the white sometimes get better treatment BUT sometimes it goes beyond color. I have learned tips are how many in the service industry get by. It will be a cold day in hell before anyone, anywhere make me feel anything less than proud for finding a way to do it, rules or no rules! Then I have the know how and balls (figuratively speaking) to pull it off.Edited: 9 years ago "
"""There is no popular notion on this island that white people are best""Not a notion a reality. Maybe you are not familiar with the mantra, yuh white yuh all right, yuh brown stick around, yuh black gu back. It has gotten better than 30+ years growing up there, but coming through MoBay airport with a white husband it felt like yesterday. I will credit from my personal experience that they are better TIPPER.Edited: 9 years ago "
"""This might be true while on Jamaica. However working as a waitress, in the US for years, the only tippers worse than black Americans were Jamaicans""Can't argue with personal experience:)...that is what it is all about. And everyone's experience is different."
"""White people are best""? Neither a notion nor, definitely, a reality on this island believe me. That old saw about white being all right, brown stick around and back go back needs to be put to rest. It was definitely created by a racist and doesn't hold true at all - regardless of what some people would like to believe!!!"
"'It was definitely created by a racist and doesn't hold true at all - regardless of what some people would like to believe!!!"" You are right. It was created by a racist/colorist and unfortunately there are many Jamaicans in this category. It is among many people of color even on the Mexican side of my family. Until the problem is fully acknowledged it won't be dealt with and therefore will never change. I can only assume you are saying it is NO longer true in your personal experience. I would never match experience with a white or even a lighter skin person in Jamaica. I know it would be different from mine, the one that was sent back:-)"
"Having also been ""sent back"" (and I am not black) I can assure you that racists come in ALL colours. It is not limited to one race by any means.When one is the target of racists it is not pleasant but you have the choice as to how you deal with it. And never, ever think that others of other races than yours do not experience the same bigotry.l"
"""Coming to Jamaica and racism, what I experienced was not racism, but a popular notion that white people are best.”I never got a PhD in English and I am not sure if this sentence was written specifically to Swamby's experience in Jamaica, as we seem to misinterpret things differently depending on how it is written. If this sentence referred to Jamaicans at the resort and those hustling for a sale, etc., I don't think that the majority of Jamaicans think that white people are the best. Jamaicans, regardless of how poor they are, seem to be very confident and proud people. If they suck up to white people while at work at the resorts and in places where money is to be made, whether in tips or sale, it is because they are looking for tips or sale for their goods and may feel that white people are RICH. Yes, a lot of people unless they have travelled and really spent some time out of the islands, do think that whether white, yellow or black, we are rich and that money is flowing on the streets up north. Get out of the tourist area and meet the intellectuals, you will get a completely different picture. Get together with those workers privately with them and you will realize that they don't even feel inferior to the people who are from the other Caribbean islands (and, of course, why should they) that are much better off than Jamaica economically. I have met and had Jamaican friends both on and off the island and this is not the impression I got from them, so this is surely a false notion for the people who think so. It may be the notion that the workers think that ALL white people are rich. If I got dressed up and looked hot and flaunted some money, they would think that I am rich too and I would get the same suck up treatment even here in Toronto. I have told one or two of my Jamaican friends that there is something called a “credit card” that most of us seem to enjoy using.I wonder if the original post writer thought that he would get such an education.Edited: 9 years ago "
