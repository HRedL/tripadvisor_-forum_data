I just booked a trip for April. Anyone concerned about the Coronavirus?
"the only thing that concerns me personally at the moment is if the world is in such a panic that flights are cancelled thus preventing us from getting down there. In fact we might benefit if we get stuck ON Anguilla :)Observing more-careful than normal hygiene (hand washing, no touching face, etc) seems prudent. But everyone has their own level of risk tolerance."
Superb post RMG. You make a lot of sense.
"""French couple taken off airport after being flagged as suspected corona virus cases"".Daily Herald SXM article today:https://www.thedailyherald.sx/islands/french…"
"Poor sods, I feel for them. I travelled this week from Sydney to London on BA and because of slight cough as a former smoker, I was worried to be taken of the flight in Singapore...luckily the airline captain had more common sense."
"Tilly, paranoia has set in; it is a terrible situation when people can be quarantined for no reason. How awful for them, and for us to have to live in fear.I hope Covid-19 has a speedy ending."
"Bless their hearts. Everyone who coughs or has a cold is now suspected of being a carrier. I’m all for being cautious, but we need to “keep a cool head even if our pants burn off” as my father says. Hubby and I arrived at SXM yesterday bound for AXA around the time this may have been going on. Personally, I’d love for our government to issue a two week in place quarantine for any of us currently outside the US. I could really handle sheltering in place on Meads Bay!"
"We are traveling to the island in April as well. We are also traveling with someone with a compromised immune system. We are more worried about one of us contracting influenza and passing it along to said traveling companion. We will be wearing masks, but we were always going to be traveling wearing them. Now we just won't stand out as much, I guess !"
"It is largely a liberal media-induced panic. The risks of contracting the virus are minimal, although the risk of travel delays are real. Face masks will not protect you."
"hahahahaah, thanks professor."
"Actually the media is reporting what the scientists are saying. They're experts by virtue of experience and education. I suppose those who find anything involving educated experts to be inherently liberal will have good reason to distrust them. And this being a travel forum, what better place to interject such political viewpoints."
"KAP nothing could be further from the truth, The facts are that over 90,000 people have the coronavirus and over 3000 have died. These numbers are from the WHO and have nothing to do with the media. Listen to the scientists not the politicians"
"Having said that, I would have no problem visiting AXA and being a little more cautious as mentioned previously. Here is a good site for COVID-19 informationhttps://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"
"And 90% of those cases are in China.And, in any event, do not even approach the number of cases/deaths from influenza.But spreading fear of an epidemic is the only way to reign in the economy, which in turn is the only way to derail a second term for Trump."
Sounds like a plan!!!

"ARGH!!!,....Sorry KAP.......but you're way off base on this one."
"At this point the deaths are much less than influenza but the mortality rate is much higher. Influenza 0.1% COVID-19 2% and this is only the early stages of the disease. The scientists are not trying to spread fear they are stating facts and urging the US to take action and not pass it off as a ""hoax"". However if you're getting your information from Fox i might as well be talking to the wall."

I think the real answer to the question is how many cases are in the areaThe answer is 2 on St Martin and 1 on St Barts. For update read the on line St Martin newspaper

Agree 100% Brian. I save my political views for Twitter and Fb
So glad we have someone like you to set us straight.

"Unfortunately not only on AnguillaEdited: 12:39 pm, March 05, 2020 "
My daughter's friend is in anguilla right now and she and her family just found out someone at their hotel has coronavirus. The guests are waiting to hear if they r going to be quarantined.
What hotel are you referring to?
Hopefully you will post an update and share any details! Thanks!
"Hi Stacey K,I just walked out of a meeting that the The Ministry of Health hosted for hoteliers and other tourism stakeholders (this was 5 minutes ago). It was very informative and transparent, and there was no mention of any such incident. The Ministry of Health reiterated that there are no cases on the island and that they are doing all they can to keep Anguilla Coronavirus free. I would go by press releases through the Ministry of Health, The Anguilla Tourist Board, and the Government of Anguilla. Should there be any instances of the virus presenting itself in Anguilla you will definitely hear, but to date it hasn't. All other hotels were represented in this meeting as well as all levels of Government."
"Frangi, a question. My problem is I have until March 15 to cancel my trip with a full refund. The trip is May 24-31. Who knows what Anguilla or the world will look like then as far as the virus is concerned? I wonder if the hotels would allow free cancellation by then? It’s hard to not cancel and risk a large sum of money."
"Im traveling in April as well. I’m worried about getting quarantined there if someone else gets sick. In theory it would be heaven to be forced to stay an extra 2 weeks. But practically it would be a nightmare for our family to miss work, school etc.."
"I'm not trying to stir anything up nor create fake news. Just reporting what my 16 year old reported. Unfortunately, she says she's not close enough to reach out to her acquaintance to find out hotel. Apologies. #teenawkardness"
"Hi Carnell04,I am sure each hotel will have their own policies regarding cancellations. As far as your reservation is concerned check your inbox for a PM from me."
"Pepper, Your posts and replies are always appreciated. Thanks for all your input."

OldManByTheC:Where is the blushing emoji when one needs it? ;-))
"And I agree. Love the Pepper posts, time for the rude trolls to go away. (School Marm, clearly he, she, it doesn’t know you.). Keep on keepin’ on Pepper. We love you here."
"This board would not be the same without you, Pepper. My guess is 99.9% of us love you here.Keep on blushing. :)"
Just wondering how the people of Anguilla have test kits for the virus when many places in the US do not seem to have them yet.
"I would think Anguilla would be a very low risk, warm climate and open air lobbies at some places. FYI lots of times when someone has a cold on the island they refer to it as the flu."
I am going in April with zero qualms. Am a microbiologist in a large hospital. Professional consensus is common sense. Penny is correct. Anguillians refer to a bad cold as the flu. Things could get easily twisted. My guess is there is no testing for Covid19 there the specimen would get sent off to the regional testing facility. I will fly to be in paradise in just about any conditions!
"Well said. I live on Anguilla and we have no cases ...yet. All travelers should follow Universal Precautions and CDC guidelines. It is simply common sense, since all travel incurs risk."
My biggest worry would be if I couldn't get back to my home because of a quarantine. But I am an optimist and have several more weeks to go so maybe it'll all come out in the wash.(Mstvl/Daffaretti: Who luvs u? :-))
My daughter just told me her friend is at The Ritz Carlton
"No ritz Carlton in Anguilla.... not saying she is wrong, but prob wrong island."
"Stacey, that’s great news because there is no Ritz in Anguilla. Her friend must be somewhere else."
"We are booked at the Frangipani in May. We went back and forth about canceling the trip bc the 60 day deadline to cancel was looming. My husband contacted the resort to see if they were extending cancellations or if their was any new policy bc of the cvirus. They simply said we should look into travel insurance. We are holding our breath and taking a chance, though! This trip is the only thing getting me through, lol. Hopefully it will all be okay!!"
I made an error. The Four seasons hotel. Apologies.
Caribbean Ritz Carlton locations:Puerto Rico (several)St. ThomasGrand Cayman Aruba Cancun
Are you saying you heard there was a case of Coronavirus at the Four Seasons Anguilla
"There are no cases in Anguilla.Be sure to read the Travel Advisory at the top left of the page, it is posted on all forums."
"Fake news, right KAP? F**king tRumpista MAGAphone!Edited: 12:36 am, March 08, 2020 "
Did they give you a recommended trip insurance company that covers a pandemic? I don’t even know how they would cover that.
RC? There isn't one in AXA
"The French Couple did have COVID 19, they had already been diagnosed, so having them go into quarantine was right for them and everyone else.Edited: 5:29 pm, March 09, 2020 "
I'll be there in 11 days...wondering the same myself.
"We are booked for May and 100% plan on going. I called Travel Guard regarding insurance. My fear is our flight being cancelled and losing the hotel deposit (over $1000). They won’t cover that. We too are approaching the 60 day cancellation window. Will keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best. . I do have a trip booked to the Caymans with my elderly mom for next month. At this rate we will be cancelling. Luckily we have a 7 day cancellation policy and Jet Blue will refund us due to a flight time change for that one.Edited: 11:14 pm, March 09, 2020 "
I have just sadly cancelled my April trip to Anguilla. Our provincial public health officer is advising against international travel at this time due to rising affected areas with covid 19.I can’t afford to travel through 8 different airports on a number of flights that may have ill people - then possibly bring an illness home. I work in healthcare and have a lot of friends and relatives who are seniors. ( the people most at risk).I also can’t afford the chance that I could get stuck quarantined somewhere for a few weeks after my vacation is done.Thanks to all the wonderful forum folks that helped my planning by offering such helpful advice. I have it all saved and will get to Anguilla for the first time - some time in the future.Regards to all and stay healthy!Audrey

"""Guess you should read todays news. Guess the government report must be fake. There are 2 confirmed cases that traveled from Paris.""Guess so, as one has been confirmed negative. Second result for the husband still pending.https://www.thedailyherald.sx/islands/one-ne… ."
"Audrey, thank heavens you have someone in your province for guidance. The Commonwealth of MA is taking the virus seriously, also, and providing updates so that organizations and local governments can take action. I have been notified by the organizations I belong to that all meetings have been cancelled until the end of March. They will assess the situation come April, but from what the CDC says, the situation will be worse.This is serious business. Italy did not handle the virus properly, and you can see what has happened there. What you do affects your family members. People need to get realistic. Washing your hands will not stop you from getting the virus."
I’m looking to go in may. Not concerned. Corona virus will live on and life will go on. When it’s my time it’s my time. They will never control it. It will work it’s way through society and life will become normal again sometime in the future. 332 million people in the US and 36 deaths. I’m sure there are thousands if not hundreds of thousands have this virus already and don’t even realize it. Anyway - I’m gonna go and love it and have a great time!
That’s all we know about. There are so many that have it that we don’t know about that will absolutely dilute the death percentages
"Just a tad ignorant and self-centered to say the least. Anyone getting on a plane at THIS time.....unless you are a Doctor or healthcare provider involved in combating this virus is just compounding the situation and putting others at harm....at home and possibly the people of Anguilla. Do the math and think about the domino effect. I would hope that folks like you that do choose to go now please not post it on this Forum, as to encourage more ignorance with such a laize fare attitude toward a serious health crisis. The problem arises when you first get ON the plane....getting from point A to point B. Incredible....just incredible. Hopefully you're not taking anyone over 60 with you. ......and you actually say ""they will never control it""......WOW.....such a positive stance on Americas Doctors, research and science. Sure, like they never controlled Polio, Smallpox, Mumps......on and on. Read a book. Have some faith.Edited: 3:42 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"Well said, Cody56. Today's NYTimes had article- passenger on JetBue flight from JFK to West Palm found out his test was positive for coronavirus while in mid-flight. First, if he needed to take a test, he never should have been on a plane. Secondly, he exposed 114 other passengers to the virus. Plus he exposed those he had interactions with at the airport at JFK. What a jerk! You can do all you can to protect yourself, but then you have these ignorant people who refuse to be educated on the subject. There seems to be a lot of people, including the government in denial."
That was totally irresponsible for that guy to have flown or even been out in the public while waiting for test results but even scarier is the fact that you can test positive and have no symptoms at all. People don’t even know they have it.

"<< ""That was totally irresponsible for that guy "" >>Irresponsible? That's an understatement.That person should be arrested and charged with a crime. If he went for a test -- and it was administered -- he had a strong suspicion he had the virus. To then willfully get on a plane — before the results came in — shows total disregard of potential to cause harm to others.That’s the very legal definition of “reckless endangerment” at a minimum."
"Re GardengirlBoston, ""washing your hands will not stop you from getting the virus"", I am board certified twice, (for a higher level of profession in Med Lab Tech) and every board you take with the American Society of Clinical Pathology has the multiple choice question ""What is the best action you take to stop the transmission of infection"" and the correct answer is always WASH YOUR HANDS!"
"My intention was to say that that action alone will not stop the virus, good start, but not the panacea."
Sad to say that today I am starting the process of canceling our travel plans to Anguilla in 2 weeks. Mainly because we would be required to do a 2 week self quarantine upon or return home and with being gone 2 weeks and another 2 weeks after of down time it’s more than we could be away from our jobs. Thank you to the SBV for allowing their guests to have the option of a full refund minus a small administrative fee or to bank the deposit for future travel. There was no question or hesitation on their part and that IMO is the workings of excellent management. We will definitely be rebooking this hotel.
"4 the record:Sadly, we are right behind you. We have had to cancel our beautiful April trip as well. It's breaking my heart.I have been on the phone non-stop calling everyone I can think of. If I missed you, forgive me.To keep myself from getting the DIF's I am now going to start an itinerary for our next trip down the line.I already have a few things in place and am just waiting for Jet Blue to put out their flight schedule so I can get new airline tickets.They were very kind, as was AAS, in holding our reservations for our future travel plans -- bless them.Keep those trip reports coming. I welcome them with open arms."
I cancelled two days ago. So sad. Second time too. Last time was because of Hurricane Irma. Let’s hope what they say about the third time is true :)
Just received notice from Airbnb that my early April reservation is 100% refundable.
Pepper and all recent folks (including us) that sadly had to cancel........Keep your chins up!........Do what we do.....view your videos from the prior year(s)!!...... Trying times that will pass.Everyone stay well.
"Pepper24 we have rebooked SBV for the first 2 weeks of December yay. Now to rebook my flights, they gave me the option to get a call back and then it says the wait time is 924 minutes and 36 seconds. All ritty then. We have a trip booked for Vegas to see Arosmith June 4 hope I don’t have to cancel that.Edited: 4:50 pm, March 14, 2020 "
"You go, girl!:-))"
"If I’m reading this correctly, travel ban to SXM includes USA? Again, if I’m reading correctly. https://smn-news.com/st-maarten-st-martin-ne…"
"Yes, I believe that you most definitely are reading that correctly.....Two weeks no entry to SXM."
Am I crazy to think I may be able to go on 4/18?!!???!!!!
KRSMooney......not crazy just very wishful which is understandable. It would definitely not be the most prudent nor responsible thing to do. In addition even if SXM removes their travel ban I doubt it very highly that it will be in two weeks. It's just not realistic. Such a tragedy economically for both AXA and SXM but some things are more important. We love and will miss the smiling faces of the older folks of Anguilla when we ride our rental car from Blowing Point to our hotel........It is for thier safety and numerous others that we must consider now. ....as well as your own and your family. Best to just stay put for now. Take care.
"Just returned from AXA, all was fine. However, yesterday, SXM government announced that flights from US, as well as Europe, will not be allowed to land after Tuesday 3/17. Period is for two weeks. PHILIPSBURG–All international flights and cruises originating from the United States of America, Europe and the United Kingdom to Sint Maarten will be cancelled for two weeks as of Tuesday, March 17, Chairperson of the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Prime Minister Silveria Jacobs said in a national address today, Saturday. As of March 14, up until and including Monday, March 16, there is an opportunity for St. Maarten students studying abroad and residents as well as essential personnel to return to the country ahead of the two-week travel restrictions. The travel restrictions do not apply for regional air and sea travel at this time. Travel within the Dutch Caribbean: Saba, St. Eustatius, Bonaire, Aruba, and Curacao remains in place until further notice. This travel restriction also applies to other seafaring vessels. Jacobs said arrangements will be put in place for visitors to return home with their carriers. Cargo flights/vessels bringing in food supplies, household goods, oil, gas, as well as medicine will continue. Also allowed, will be travel by technical and medical assistants whether via commercial or chartered airlines.“All residents and nationals traveling back to Sint Maarten from the United States, Europe and the United Kingdom during this period, are recommended to monitor their health for 14-days for consistent cough, fever or respiratory problems (consistent with COVID-19) and maintain a social distance for the safety and security of the community. If you experience the aforementioned symptoms, please call your family physician. Do not go to your doctor or the medical center. During the phone call with your doctor, you will be advised further what actions should be taken,” she stressed.  The PM said these preventive measures are to limit the exposure of the Sint Maarten people to COVID-19 due to an increase in COVID-19 cases in Europe and the United States of America and based on the World Health Organisation (WHO’s) declaration on Wednesday, March 11, that the coronavirus has become a global pandemic. “Based on this declaration, the Government of Sint Maarten has stepped up its preparations and today March 14, after deliberation with the Council of Ministers and the EOC a number of decisions have been taken,” she said."
"We are scheduled to arrive on May 16. I hope everything is back to normal by then but I doubt it will be. I also wouldn’t want to put anyone at risk with us not knowing if we’ve been exposed. I reached out to our hotel earlier in the week as we were approaching the non refundable deposit date. Luckily they were very understanding and said in the event we could not go due to canceled flights or quarantines they’d give us a year from our travel dates to apply the deposit. Plan B will be to go early July. Plan C would be February. At this rate I’m thinking early July may be unrealistic also.Edited: 8:40 am, March 15, 2020 "
We are scheduled to arrive May 6. What hotel were you staying with?
There are two cases in St. Martin so I hope the flight doesn't canceled.
"We were suppose to leave April 3-13...just cancelled, and was refunded.We are also planning on returning in July for our WEDDING. That is even starting to look a little worrisome!"
We just left anguilla today. Ports closed as of midnight and airports close Sunday. If u did not have a flight to leave on the same day as your boat passage they would not let u into sxm. Pretty bad coordination on the 2 governments. Meanwhile in Anguilla the last of the tourists have packed up. Zemi closed earlier this week and most restaurants were fairly empty. Last night At Veya we were one of 2 tables. They were closing on Saturday. Straw hat gave us an awesome lobster and crayfish dinner Wednesday night for next to nothing to get of their food. Yes while I feel bad for us having to cut our trip short and scrambling to find a way home and for the people whose trips will be cancelled I feel most sad for the wonderful anguillians. They have just started to rebound after the hurricane and now hotels and restaurants r closed and people laid off. It just broke my heart!
"i think, today we should stay at home.. We dont know yet whats going on april. Many cancelled flight"
