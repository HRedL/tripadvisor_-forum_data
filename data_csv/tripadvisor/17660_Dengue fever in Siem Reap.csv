"Hi,we are going to Siem Reap in 3 weeks time. What about the Dengue Fever outbreak there? We just read that it is the worst outbreak ever.Do we really need to wear long pants and long sleave shirts during the day??? Or is a moscito repellent enough?Thanks for your answers."
"dengue fever is quite prevelant, and its not really that much of an issue to cover up a bit - you shouldn't be wearing shorts and a sleveless top anyway! make sure you use a good insect repellent with deet in itthe dengue fever that effects the locals tends to be the more severe form - haemoragic, this rarely effects tourists, but dengue fever is still an unpleasant illness to get. Will still need the spray in the evening for the malaria mosis "
"Hi, can only reinforce what air has posted, with a good repellant you may get away with short sleeved shirts but long pants are a must and as many suggest we found that light cotton is best. Maleria is also to be taken seriously, if you can take malerone the side effect of photosensitivity is less but the less expensive anti maleria drugs require you to cover up or sunburn can be bad.If you are fit and healthy and can spare an hour you may consider making a blood donation at the hospital, its on the main road to the temples and will help them a lot.As with any travel to this part of the world it is always best to consult a travel medical clinic prior to leaving home and take a well stocked first aid kit with you. It is important that you take any necessary medication with you as availability and quality are both issues in Cambodia.None of this is that hard to do and absolutly worth it to see and more importantly to take home some great memories of this amazing place. Have a great trip. "
"Hi there, I am heading in 2 days and wasnt aware of this!!! You guys may have saved us. So dengue fever is out of control there at the moment?At all times you should be covered up? Is this the jist of it as I am not very familiar with what is required etc...Any nhelp gratefully accepted!thanksandrew"
"Hi Andrew, this is nothing to panic about, we were there in June and the outbreak was serious but of little threat to well resourced tourists. It is important to cover up for both a range of health reasons including sunburn but also for cultural reasons. Just make sure you take an adequate supply of good quality repellent and use it. "
"out of control is a little misleading, but there is an epidemic as is fairly usual. Dengue Fever and malaria are the 2 things mentioned in any guide book! just use some insect repellent with deet and cover up"
"It is not 'out of control'! The media is out of control! Wear long pants, and opt for light colors (bugs dig dark colors). DEET-based insect repellent is the best way to go, but you can be extra sure by treating garments with Permethrin (read the labels carefully before you attempt this) and bring (or buy there) mosquito coils to burn at your guesthouse. "
There is a higher amount of Dengue fever victims this year then normal but it is usually amongst the poorer locals who do not take the proper precautions against mosquitoes. If you cover up and use repllants then you should have no problems. You would be pretty unlucky to catch Dengue fever in a short visit to Cambodia.Dengue fever is rarely life threatening and although not pleasant it is like having a heavy flu and normally lasts about a week if you take medication given from a doctor.
Thanks to all for the advices. Looking forward to going to SR.
"We were in SR from 11/09 to 14/09. Both of us did not apply any repellent. Surprisingly, both of us was not bitten even once. So I guess the mosquito problem is not as bad as we thought."
"Only one kind of mosquito spread Dengue Fever. Don't worry, the most severe time is July to Augest. we were in there 08/09-14/09, apply good insect repellent, keep away mosquito, ants or other bugs. Wheather is cooler and cooler, mosquito will decrease."
