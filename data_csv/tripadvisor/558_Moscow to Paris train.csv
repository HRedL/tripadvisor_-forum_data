"See if this link will help, you will get excellent advice from it, When it opens just scroll down a bit to see the Moscow Paris informationhttps:/…Moscow_to_BerlinEdited: 11:06 pm, August 06, 2020 "
"The significant words to be found in the items above are ""COVID-19 update: This train is suspended until further notice. """
"I'm afraid most of those international trains(especially night trains) which have not resumed already may never resume again. It is kind of ironic that it's happening right after everyone was talking about a renaissance of night trains.There will be a way to travel from Paris to Moscow by train(in fact it'll be probably easier than ever, because of the agreement between Russia and Belarus), but I don't think there will be a direct train. You'll have to change in Frankfurt, Berlin and perhaps even in Warsaw."
@Luftmensch why do you think that train won’t resume? I think it will because if there is demand for something it is typically there. So I would expect the train to return.
It also makes sense for the train to have not resumed yet as the EU area still has a travel ban on Russia.
"Poster 3, yes, the train has not resumed, however since the OP did not give a date for travel the information given may be relevant if and when the OP decides to book."
"Russia's borders are closed, and it can't run.I see no reason it won't resume when borders reopen and the pandemic subsides.Most other European trains have already resumed, where borders are open."
"Contrary to the predictions of certain people in this and an earlier thread, the domestic night trains in Italy and the Austrian-run night trains between Italy and Germany/Austria have now returned to service, as have all daytime international trains to/from Italy. Only the Thello Paris-Milan-Venice night trains have not yet been revived.I see no reason why the Paris-Moscow nd Nice-Moscow trains should not return, once tourist travel between Russia and the EU is again permitted."
What about the Lusitania and the Sud Express?
"""I think it will because if there is demand for something it is typically there.""I'm not sure if there was a huge demand for the Berlin - Paris route. Germany, especially Berlin has a large Russian/Volga German community, but the Russian community of Paris is much older(the 'grandchildren' of White Russian emigrés) who are well integrated to French society and have much looser ties to the Motherland, not to mention that 99% of people would not think of taking a train from Paris to Moscow when they can fly. Berlin - Moscow is short enough(by Russian standards) to travel by train and the demand is there. The fact that the train is running only 1/week indicates low demand. Trains between Berlin and Moscow are more frequent, Germany is their real market until the last babushkas die in Germany.There could be a demand for the Paris-Berlin overnight leg, but there are several problems:1) Lack of affordable fares(no couchette/platzkart option)2) Not a daily service, so you can't just go for a weekend to Paris and return with the same train.3) Lack of marketing, booking problems.Add to all that the economic crisis Russia is facing due to record low oil/gas prices and the COVID impact and the beancounters at Rzhd may win over those who say that Russia must have a train to Paris(and Nice) and use this opportunity to quietly kill this train. It was suspended due to COVID, so all they have to do is not doing anything. I guess they could simply cut it back running Moscow-Berlin only.I heard a rumour that the Moscow-Nice train will have to be suspended anyway in a couple of years when the very strict new Italian safety regulations come into effect which won't allow the currently used Russian rolling stock into Italy."
