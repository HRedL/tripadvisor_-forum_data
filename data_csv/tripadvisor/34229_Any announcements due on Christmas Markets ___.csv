"Hi all, Following on from the cancellation of the Oktoberfest, does anyone know please, when a decision is expected to be made on this years Christmas markets ? I've tried searching online and on the Munich tourism websites, but can't find anything. They're unlikely to go ahead I suppose, but I live in hope ! Thanks is advance. Mick"
No. For now all large events until Aug 31 are cancelled throughout Germany - plus Oktoberfest. Nobody knows what's ahead thereafter.
"Oh, and the Cannstatter Volksfest in Stuttgart that would also take place Sep/Okt is also already cancelled."
I attended a webinar which included Germany Tourism yesterday. They weren't able to give long term information but will keep their website up to date regarding Coronavirus. I know this doesn't answer your question but I hope it will be helpful. https:/…sars-cov-2.htmlI think everyone is hoping for the best.
I have heard that some of the bigger markets are not going ahead this year as they take months to organize and a lot of money.I have stands in some smaller markets so hopeful that they might happen
"I really enjoy the smaller markets! One of my favorites is the Michelstädter Weihnachtsmarkt, I love the alleys (die Gassen) and also the ones that take place in the forests. Hoping the markets take place and it's a good season for you."
Also remember the rumor is the virus is supposed to be deadlier come fall as well. At least that is what the analysts are saying.
"Jordansbulls either back that claim up or remove it. Given the Southern Hemisphere is in late autumn, explain the thousands of deaths below the equator?"
"The virus doesn’t change with the season, it doesn’t become more or less deadly. Virus outbreaks are generally more common in fall and winter when it‘s damp and when people spend more time inside - the typical flu season. Hence the fear of a second, bigger wave in the fall. That could be all the worse the further the virus gets transported over the summer with less strict lockdowns. But, of course, it‘s just one possible scenario."
"Jordansbulls that is incorrect. Just look at Singapore for one example.Edited: 3:58 pm, May 09, 2020 "
"The thread on Christmas markets sure got off track. Jordan’s comment is U.S. specific and is derived from extensive media coverage correctly noting that, in the U.S., during the worldwide flu pandemic of 1918-1922, the second wave of flu (September-November 1918) was much, much more deadly than the first wave (Spring 1918).Edited: 7:46 pm, May 09, 2020 "

"@JB, that is US specific and this is the Germany forum!Edited: 3:06 am, May 10, 2020 "
"Indeed, that link to the Washington Post is irrelevant. @Jordanbulls for clarity, in case you aren't aware? Anything in the south of the southern hemisphere, ie Australia, New Zealand, the seasons are totally opposite to the North. So June to August for example would be the height of winter."
"Well, as for the Christmas markets, I think no-one would want to cancel them yet - after all, people are still hoping for a vaccine, and if there is one, then maybe the Christmas markets can go ahead as planned?So, I think it's too early to tell."
"""@JB, that is US specific and this is the Germany forum!""Sorry, I lived in Chicago and NYC so when I think of Munich/Berlin I think of similar weather 5-10 degrees more or less all year around."
"this was to be my first river cruise for the life long dream of christmas markets...however I have heard that quarantine restrictions could be placed on people coming in from the US,Is there any thoughts on this ?"
"@Jodi R, you are roughly 5 to 6 months away from your scheduled trip. My wife and I have reservations in Germany during December for 2 weeks. I am waiting to cancel Delta One flights when there is a relaxation in fees. October Fest has been canceled. It is too early to tell and announcements will be made. No guarantees but the Schengen area countries (26 total) will take a hard look at the US and its lack of credible Covid-19 practices. IMHO opinion, our Orange Blob adds to the confusion. I'd be very surprised that your cruise happens. Quarantine would certainly be a possibility. Just watch the TA thread. Also, your cruise company will apprise you of the travel developments. Safe travels."
thank you ! Unfortunately we are thinking the same...The closer it gets the higher the number (of fake news) reports...... :(
"We've got plans for Munich in early December for Christmas Markets, but it's too early to speculate on anything right now. Too many variables, so we're keeping our flights and hotel plans in tact until there is some actionable news. Not sure what 'fake news' reports are being referenced: it's factual that visitors from the USA are not welcome in the EU because of our failure to effectively manage the pandemic here. Until the USA travel restrictions are (hopefully) lifted, we can only wait and see...and hope."
"Bob,We welcome our cousins from across the pond, but maybe think about coming in 2021, when I hope things are more or less back to normal.I am sure that given the size of the US, you can find a,suitable alternative for this year.I speak as a UK citizen, we may not be too welcome on the continent at the moment either."
"The way the US has mismanaged our response to the pandemic, we certainly do not deserve to be admitted into anyplace internationally. I have no expectations that our Munich trip will happen; however, our flight and hotel reservations are 100% cancellable and refundable so I have the luxury of taking a 'wait and see' attitude. We typically visit the EU 6-7 times each year and always during Christmas Markets, so if they are cancelled and/or if US citizens continue to be banned from the EU, we will be disappointed but realize that 2021 will be our best option. Stay safe everyone, cheers!"

Sorry about the double post: connectivity hiccup with my laptop!
"I read on a Cologne website in the past couple of days that they know a decision will need to be made shortly, but cannot figure out a way how to make it safe and do not want to cancel if at all possible. I imagine this is the situation in most of the country. I have not read of any municipality that has yet made a decision either way."
"The market in Altstadt Spandau has been cancelled and replaced by a smaller market in the Citadel; admission can be tightly controlled as there's only one way in to the citadel. I'd have thought that this decision would be joint between the promoter, the Citadel, and the borough council. Expect more cancellations or restrictions."
"One of my favourite markets, the one in Maulbronn, has been cancelled."
"It is strange I have heard of many of the larger markets being cancelled or drastically reduced but with liitle to no publicity.Some i know will be 15/20 craft stands no food or drink,these would normally be large busy markets.We have to wait until mid Sept for decisions on our markets but i an not holding out much hope. The organiser has to lay out some 3/400 000€ in advance, the stand holders some 20000+ each, if at the end it is planned to go ahead but gets shut on dat two many will be bankrupt.I kind of hope the do some craft stands and this all, I really don't want to lay out 30000€ to get them cancelled at last momentEdited: 6:38 pm, August 25, 2020 "
"#27. Since you are involved in Christmas Markets, can you give the cost for a permit to operate a stand at some of the different Christmas Markets. This should be a good indication of the popularity of particular markets when compared to others."
"No not really the cost varies greatly with who the organizer is, some are operated by the city others are private. The more popular ones with reasonable charges have a waiting list to get a place often 15+ years (Stuttgart is one)One of the more expensive is Charlottenburg Palace , we had a stand the first year it opened and paid 10k the next year they asked for 30kfor the same thing. I know of a number of people that have gone bankrupt paying those sorts of rates"
"The decision on the Munich market will not be made until the autumn and they are still working on a strategy to deal with the corona threat. source, from article published a couple of hours ago : https:/…S8qQ0zGEdited: 8:39 am, August 27, 2020 "
Thanks for the update! Stay safe.
"This from DW News today:There was no decision on whether to give the green light for Germany’s beloved Christmas markets to operate. According to sources that attended the meeting, chancellor Merkel said it was too early to decide on whether to allow Christmas markets.The chancellor was apparently put under pressure by the regional leader of Saxony, where the Dresden Christmas market takes place.Under normal conditions, markets are full of people drinking mulled wine and looking at the souvenir and food stalls.Meanwhile, organizers of the Cologne Christmas market at the city’s iconic cathedral already announced they would not be opening this year. "
"As Saxony was mentioned - The authorities in Dresden plan for the Christmas markets to take place. Their plan is to expand the Striezelmarkt e.g. into neighbouring streets so the stalls have much more distance to each other and glass walls between tables of mulled wine/food stands. No idea if this is going to work, though. However, if you know the layout of the old town you know that there is a wide street (Wildsdruffer Strasse) that runs from Altmarkt square (where Striezelmarkt takes place) to the east and west and IMO this concept deserves a chance.I am pretty sure that smaller Christmas markets which are rarely visited by tourists but mostly by locals will take place under strict distance rules.All this given that the number of infections doesn't rise dramatically until then (it is pretty low in Saxony compared to western/southern regions in Germany.)"
The problem is registering the visitors (or those just going through the area) I am hearing more plans to have some craft stands only within an enclosed area and an entry charge +registration
"Yes, that would be a problem. But so far there is no obligation for registration in museums or restaurants in Saxony (unlike in other states) and the administration here wants to avoid that like the plague."
"regarding the idea of registration, it sounds quite like some beer or wine tasting events ive been at over the years. Capacity by its nature is limited, and it (maybe??) wouldnt be comercially viable if it were free, so you needed to buy a ticket in advance. On the day there was no need to register with your name and address but they were normally very well attended so if they were to have asked, it wouldnt have been many people needing to sign up Doing it for a craft market wouldn't look much different I wouldn't think. I heard other suggestions that local festivities (in the deepest out of the way back waters) could proceed if they can keep it to locals only, implementable easily as the german ID has your address written on it, which caters for most potential customers."
"If they can control the entrance to be able to check your id then they can get people to use the app to scan in, the issue is controlling the entrance. That is not possible in a town or city centreFifteen craft stands is a lot different to a hundred or more with food and drink as usual, the amount of visitors will also be drastically reduced"
"https://www.saechsische.de/sachsen-will-weih…(in German, sorry) Basically saying that the Saxon state administration wants to make Christmas markets possible one way or another, given that infection numbers don't rise dramatically. Individual rules for each market/each town and the health departments in each town has the final word on the matter. They expect less visitors since hardly any tourists from abroad will visit.It doesn't sound like mandatory registration or fenced off areas. My guess is the markets will take place with less stalls on extended grounds."
"Saxony may just be the odd one out then as other states do want there to be registration. There should be announcements early September about how strict things will be. At the moment the organizers of the markets are trying to work out how to comply with current rules and whether to make the large investments needed to do the markets,. A medium sized market costs up to 500k which is a lot of money to lose if it has to be cancelled with increased infections"
"@eagle2002, Thank you for your updates. We will cancel our trip to Dresden due to Covid19 for December. While we are sad, we feel it is much more important for Germany and its citizens to enjoy their traditions as a way of getting their feet on the ground. You have done a better job in handling Covid19 than we have in the USA. It will be interesting when citizens of the USA will be allowed into the Schengen Area. LOL, we cannot travel across the border to our norther neighbor, Canada. I will miss the beautiful lights and stalls in Dresden. I am happy that I have located a source for Veerpoorten Eierlikor and also Verpooten Chocolate bars filled with Eierlikor cream. What we will miss is sharing those items with our friends in Dresden. Locating a source for Dresdner Eierschecke will be a challenge. I can find a similar item by nothing like the best in Dresden. :>( I still have 2 tubes of Thomy Mustard and one Jar from Molkerei Pfund recommended and tasted with a good friend. Be safe in your travels and may you all be healthy and well. We hope to see you in 2021 and make up for lost time and stimulation of our Christmas senses 1NCF"
