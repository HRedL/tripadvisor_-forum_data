Can you give us some updates on how things are? We are suppose to fly down on April 8th from New York. Are visitors getting in and out without issue. I know our VG flight with Cape Air has been changed to Beef Island...any info would be appreciated. Thanks!
We are scheduled to come May 1st. Just waiting to see if we have to change our plans.
"Cape air is only letting me use my credit, if I cancel, for 1 year from when I purchased my ticket, not 1 year from when I am scheduled to fly...."
"If you are coming from NY you will go thru enhanced evaluation. and maybe quarantine. BVI is doing what they can to stop the virus from reaching their shores. I am self isolating on Virgin Gorda till this is over. By the way anything over 80 degrees and the virus dies.Edited: 9:43 am, March 15, 2020 "
"Unfortunately, the idea that the virus will die over 80 degress is being spread by the internet, wishful thinking and our own ""higher ups"". That idea, while we would all like to hope that will be the case, has not been proven. It is entirely possible that, like other infectious diseases, this will be impacted seasonally but as of now, we just don't know. Look to Sigapore and other warm climes that have outbreaks. Average temp in Singapore is 83 degrees and humid, and people are infected. Stay Healthy!"
"<< “ By the way anything over 80 degrees and the virus dies.” >>No. No. Just... no.The season aspect of colds/flu etc has nothing do with temperature, per se, but rather behavioral/social patterns related to warm weather.Edited: 10:19 am, March 15, 2020 "
"Just returned yesterday without any travel disruptions (we flew in and out of STT and took ferries to and from VG). However, the situation seemed rather fluid. Hope things go well for you."
Very few sailboats in the channel today. Very few rental cars on the road. Everything is VERY quiet.
"We are schedule to bareboat, flying down April 17th. I'm very concerned about actually being able to go. As of right now, our charter company is not offering any refunds or rebooking. It's a lot of money on the line."
"Up to now AA is maintaining their Caribbean schedule..No cases in the BVI but I suspect will see some. BVI government may elect to limit persons coming into the country. Everything is very fluid. Speedy ferry is not doing STT at all.Edited: 12:19 pm, March 16, 2020 "
BVI will close to all non-islanders on Thursday March 19th.
<< “ BVI will close to all non-islanders on Thursday March 19th.” >>Link... ?

I haved not seen this in the local press. Where did you find this information?
"Cabinet endorsed that entry into the British Virgin Islands by sea or air be prohibited with effect from Thursday, 19th March, 2020 for all passengers, who are not nationals, Belongers, Work Permit Holders or persons ordinarily resident in the Territory, or their dependents. The travel restriction will not apply to flight crews, diplomats or freight, cargo or courier craft or vessels;"
Do they say until when? Thanks....
Rumor is a moth suspension of non-residents entry
Right now BVI is closed to everyone.
"It is a very fluid situation. Weather is great. Bank is closed until further notice.ATM is/was working. Lots of food and everything else at the markets.Windy with some rain. I and Pam are staying at our villa for the duration.Edited: 7:33 pm, March 23, 2020 "
I cannot think of a better place to be quarantined!Stay safe.
"Went to the valley today. Got $500 out of the ATM. Went up to Mad Dogs which was open. The rest of the Baths shops are closed. It was very quiet and so different. No taxis, no noise except for the chickens.. Immigration is only giving 15 days of extensions. For this they charged me $20 I find that annoying ."
"Oh and for you that wanted to rent Necker Island to hide, its already taken for 2-3 months.. also Sir Richard is hiding out in the BVI. So it me and Sir Richard doing our duty in the BVI"
Your description sounds like being there in late Sept to early October - best time of the year to be on Virgin Gorda
Entry to the BVI is currently closed
"Right now the entire BVI is in a complete lock down. No ferries running. Lock down is to end April 2 but I suspect it may be extended.. Mooring has laid off all staff. No business is being conducted. Do not expect to come to the BVI before something like May at the earliest. In addition if they let you in you will probably have to under go 14 days of quarantine.. Lots of food on Virign Gorda. We hope to get the island virus free and then not allow anyone in without a quarantine.Edited: 9:50 am, March 27, 2020 "
Good to hear Thorsten - like the idea of making it virus free
"The BVI is under another additional 14 day lock down, complete lock down from 6 pm to 6 am and a modified lock down from 6 am to 6 pm where folks are allowed to do a limited amount of shopping, banking etc No one is allowed in or out."
Agree with Brian-happy to stay out to protect the island we love. Sunnier days ahead....
"My bareboat charter company cancelled all bookings about two-weeks ago, advising they would send out refund coupons, which they did. However, “cash” or reversing charge would have been more customer friendly..."
Bareboat companies will have a hard time coming back I sure do understand why they are not making cash refunds. They don't have the cash to do it.. Everyone on island has expenses which are now coming out of reserves which are limited. Even the BVI government is going to be cash strapped. Some folks don't have the reserves even to buy food.
It will be interesting to see what BVI does post lock down - clearly they really can't open up the borders until the US has its situation under control and that won't be until the end of June. The island folks are going to be needing a lot of financial support.
"Forme the game changer will be when all airlines screen their passengers for the virus using machines that detect the virus, not the elevated temperature testing that has been done. The BVI would also have to get these machines to test everyone coming into the country for a positive for the virus. That is the only way the persons could start coming in again. No one wants to come to the BVI and have to undergo a 14 day quarantine. I believe this virus will be around for a long timeEdited: 8:12 am, April 07, 2020 "
"<< ""when all airlines screen their passengers for the virus using machines that detect the virus,"" >>Unfortunately, I don't think you'll ever see this happening.The logistical and financial realities would preclude implementation in any way that would be even remotely effective in ensuring that no one carrying the virus gets on a plane... or enters the BVIs."
Right now no on is allowed back into the BVI. Something has to encourage the BVI to allow tourists back in and it is not money. . I agree with the government that anyone coming in has to prove or be allowed to test to insure they are not carrying the virus. Too much is at stake including the-fact that the medical facilities are very limited and they cannot afford a full scale virus attack. I also beive that the media has caused a world wide fear and that the number dying i much less than a typical year of flu deaths.
"I hear what you're saying, but when you do some back-of-the-envelope math, it becomes quickly apparent that screening people before they board a flight or upon entry is beyond impractical.According to the Abbott labs press release their new COVID 19 test platform can reduce time to results ""to as little as five minutes for positive results and 13 minutes for negative results.""So you're really looking at a test that is ""possibly"" as short as 13 minutes to find out whether the person tested is actually negative... which is what you're looking for.Let's add a few minutes for sample collection, thirteen minutes for each test, and a few minutes to clean the machine to prep for the next test. Just to make the math easy, let's call that 15 minutes per test. Let's further assume that a typical jet flying into St Thomas, San Juan, etc holds 200 passengers.Assuming that every gate at every airport has a testing machine, at 15 minutes per passenger, we're looking at 3,000 minutes to screen every passenger boarding a single commercial flight. Yes... that's 50 HOURS of testing time to board a SINGLE flight. Even though an assumption of one machine at every gate is absurd, let's assume there's TWO machines. OK... now only 25 hours to board that flight. Four machines? Still gonna take 12 and a half hours to board a single flight. 8 machines? Now we're down to just over six hours of screening time to board ONE flight. Let's go crazy and assume there are SIXTEEN machines at every gate in the world. We're now down to adding ONLY three hours of screening time to board a single flight. If having ONE machine at every gate is crazy... what does that mean for requiring THIRTY TWO machines at every gate which is what would be needed to make this even remotely practical for a single flight.But let's take the math further.Consider JFK airport, which typically sees about 160,000 passenger a day. That'd mean 2.5 MILLION extra minutes a day to test people. That's roughly 42,000 HOURS a day of testing time. Having enough machines to reduce the additional wait time for each flight to under 2hrs would require just north of 20,000 machines... AT JFK ALONE. Multiple that times how many airports around the world?Plus... where will we find the hundreds of thousands of trained/qualified healthcare workers to collect the samples, process the tests, etc.Sure when you say screening all passengers will be a game changer, that sounds simple enough.But when you do the math involved, you realize that this is an entirely impractical idea."
Here is the situation on Virgin Gorda. The lock down is to end April 20th No new cases have been found. Thus I expect the folks will be allowed to start the long road back to recovery again I have AA frequent flyer tickets on hold for May 13 from STT to Miami. I have completed my task to rebuild the South Sound Villa for over 2.5 years. It is all I had imagined it to be for the rebuild..It is time for me to leave and go back to Vero Beach for a month or so and then I will probably go back to the villa in late June to enjoy what I did.
"What does ""end of lockdown"" mean? That they reopen the BVI to anyone and everyone or that simply residents are more free to move about? I sure hope it is only the latter! As this was just breaking there were plenty of people still planning on going depite warnings. It was only cancelled flights and closed borders that stopped them-not reason. An April re-opening is way too soon and I hope that isn't the case. I wanted to reschudule our trip for July but I am not even sure I will feel comfortable with that."
"End of lock down to me is anyone on VG can move about and continue their lives. I would think the borders will open by July The BVI economy needs to get going. There will be strict checks on who is coming in and where they have been.Edited: 11:48 am, April 11, 2020 "
"As of today (and that can change at any moment) Virgin gorda residents can move about , go to the grocery store, hardware store etc. The South Sound Villa rebuild is done and I am expecting to leave around May 14 and may not be allowed to return until Sept 1 I hope it is earlier as I would like to get the villa ready for hurricane season.. Kind of sad, I have spent 2.5 years on a rebuild and now there are no guests nor can I even use the villa."
Everything changed in an instant. One person died today. Government added another week of 24/7 lock-down Pam and I decided not to travel back to Vero Beach until further notice. We ordered food and it was delivered. A farmer also brought us fresh green beans Yummy!Life now changes from moment to moment.
That is horrible news! Are case numbers increasing or is this from the original batch of positive people? Best wishes to you and Pam. Stay safe!
"This person is from the Philippines. She reported her condition to the government who sent over a team to collect a specimen. She was not put into the hospital. From what I have read she called several more times and eventually someone brought her to the hospital where she died. Someone who came into contact with her is also positive and is in the hospital.Since not much testing has occurred, it is difficult to say how many are positive. Very fluid situation."
Good choice not going back to Florida - It's going to be very bad there very quickly - not enough testing and not sufficient physical distancing let alone the demographics.
"If you need me to go to your villa after the curfew ends, let me know. Glad to be your eyes on the ground."
Hi Thorsten - not necessary - we have our own management company and we continue to pay our maid and landscapers even though there are no guests - but if you want to tour Mahoe Bay there won't be anyone else around - take a dip or snorkel from the beach - cheers Brian
"Have never gone off your beach. As soon as curfew is over will take a lookEdited: 1:13 pm, April 21, 2020 "
It's like Savannah - just walk in and there are three reef formations - wish I was there.
I will go instead of you!!
Have fun - any pictures would be great - missing Adagio and Virgin Gorda
Yes! Pictures WOULD be great!
"Wow, that poor woman passed away, how sad and now another in hospital. Certainly everything changes day to day here as well.I think it will be a long time before any of us can travel and I certainly wouldn't chance it anyway. Just too much unknown factors.Stay well everyone!"
"Please don't feel you cannot travel. My personal feeling is that the covid 19 has been vastly overblown by the media. And they continue to fan the flames. Even though I am 81, I have no problem traveling. I always stay away from other persons, set the air nozzle in the plane directly at me so I am breathing clean air. I have been at my villa for 100 days. It was a job that needed to be done by me and now it is time for me to leave. Working on leaving by being the captain of a private yacht to STT"
That is not fresh air. It is mostly recirculated air and some fresh.
