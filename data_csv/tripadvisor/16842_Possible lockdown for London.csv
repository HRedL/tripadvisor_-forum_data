I’ve noted on the news that the government is proposing to lock down London within the M25 if covid 19 figures rise too much. How would that be enforced as it’s a long road not to mention would the trains be stopping short either side of the M25 when the nations railways all merge toward London. Also there are millions that live in the Home Counties and work in London.
"Speculative press stories to generate revenue. However, I image it could be achieved in a similar fashion to that which other countries have adopted."
"I wouldn't rule it out at some point, but I don't think that such a lockdown is needed yet. I agree that the stories are speculation. At the worst the government is seeing what sort of a reaction they can expect if something like this is necessary later."
Arguably this should have been done in March. I really don’t see how it could be enforceable now. Leicester wasn’t sealed off during its local lockdown so I can’t see how they could even begin to do it. Goods vehicles and key workers would need to drive in and out. The manpower to set up road blocks would be huge and the police really won’t want to committing resources to it. The army isn’t the answer to that either. They aren’t trained in dealing with the public and whereas in March and April virtually everyone would have been cooperative and compliant I just don’t think that’s the case now.
"Assume restrictions might get worse everywhere anytime. How and when, nobody knows."
The army have no authority over civilians.
"“ The army have no authority over civilians.”Until granted by the government.......,"
">>Until granted by the government.......,<<Which would require the declaration of martial law, and that is not going to happen."
It’s called Military Assistance to the Civil Authority https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2…
"""Which would require the declaration of martial law,""No it wouldn't."
"can I just remind you of Northern Ireland, I don't recall martial law there (although I do accept that the concept of law was sometimes a bit vague there.....)Anyway, not needed because it's in the good old Civil Contingenices Act 2004, section 22, para 3(L)https:/…22"
"....... but currently sounds like ""news"" sites going for click bait. More likely that indivudual London Boroughs would be controlled, both easier and way of scaring the others to get their acts together.Which one does Mr Cumming live in?"
"#7.Martial Law was never declared in Northern Ireland even at the height of the ""Troubles"" - the Army were on the Streets to ""support the Police"" and we had the Army assisting the Met when they didn't have enough AFOs to cover requirements quite recently, and there was no declaration of martial law."
The key phrase in the authority is “public health epidemics”
"""Deploying"" is not the same as giving them authority to order people about. I don't answer to the army.>>No it wouldn't.<<I think you'll find it does."
I appreciate Bungle doesn't like to deal in facts and comes along to troll threads. I'll leave you to it.
">>Martial Law was never declared in Northern Ireland even at the height of the ""Troubles"" - the Army were on the Streets to ""support the Police"" and we had the Army assisting the Met when they didn't have enough AFOs to cover requirements quite recently, and there was no declaration of martial law.<<NI is hardly the same as the rest of the UK. And that is a slight twisting of the facts. They were not acting as pseudo police officers, they were merely assigned at key locations that needed a security presence."
"@15 Don't start. More like it's ""facts"" that you don't like. No doubt you're one of the people always calling for the army to be called in at every little thng."
"And let's not forget the last time people kept insisting something was the case when it very, very clearly was not. So maybe think about that before calling me a ""troll"". You're the troll."
"“They were not acting as pseudo police officers, they were merely assigned at key locations that needed a security presence.”A difficult line to argue, that was certainly not my role in several uniformed visits to that part of the UK - have you looked at the reference I provided?"
@19 In that part of the UK? London?I read it. It seems a bit vague to me as to what it actually means in practice.
"Which one does Mr Cumming live in?--Islington. However, locking down individual boroughs would be difficult. I live near the boundary of Wandsworth and Lambeth, to the point that I can enter Lambeth depending on how I go to the supermarket. Some boundaries even go down the middle of residential streets, so people on one side pay council tax to a different borough."
"#20I do wonder what part of “The armed forces can be brought in to deal with a range of situations including, but not limited to:...... public health epidemics;” is unclear? They (I have retired) can if the government says so......,,They are already running testing stations and adding staff to hospitalsEdited: 3:19 pm, August 03, 2020 "
"The M25 story is just dreadful clickbait probably started by someone in government testing the waters and taken up by Newsquest who own a chain of local newspapers such as my local Watford Observer whose website makes Tripadvisor's look award winning. Their lead earlier today, once you got past the adverts, the cookie acceptance, the demand for you to take part in a survey and of course the piece de resistance, highlights of a pre lockdown National League game . was indeed the M25 story accompanied by a picture of a near empty motorway and, naturally, a poll as to whether you dear reader thought it was a good idea.This was once a great newspaper with sports coverage the envy of Fleet Street. Very sad.Rant over...carry on."
Adamhornets - a wan smile rather than a knowing look....
"Is it too late to get Chris Grayling involved with the M25 plan? He's got form at ensuring things are c*cked up as much as possible, and given the chance to turn the M25 into the One True Ring of Tarmacadam he'd probably enjoy the opportunity to wreak more havoc these days."
Sadly I think Grayling's got his paws on Spys 'R' Us or whatever the ISC is called instead. Otherwise he'd be perfect for this latest venture in Brewery P**s up management.
"When NY State was in total lockdown businesses were too, except for essential businesses (like grocery stores and drugstores) and essential employees. So even if neighboring counties and states hadn't also been in lockdown, far fewer people would have been coming into the city because the vast majority of jobs were not considered essential. As far as I know, there were no police or military monitoring who was coming and going and the streets, trains and buses were practically empty (as some still are). Most of the police I saw were idling their vehicles and flashing their lights near supermarkets and convenience/drug stores that had become easy targets for thieves with everything so quiet after around 7 PM."

"The point I was trying to make earlier is that all central and local government can do is make businesses or public sector places close. The aspects of lockdown to do with where you can go or who you can see can’t realistically be enforced now, using troops won’t change that. My friends in Manchester tell me that the pubs and parks are full of large groups of people from multiple households with no social distancing in direct contravention of the local lockdown there. There is no attempt at enforcement."
Skinnycats- valid points. But doesn't alter the fact that the original post was reacting to what was little more than a hoax. If there was definately a lockdown it would be valid as a TA post because it would affect travellers - but this thread is borderline because it offers nothing to travellers. Except perhaps teaching them not to believe everything they see on the web.
"As I understand it, the kernel of truth at the heart of this inflated clickbait story was that the government has war-gamed a number of scenarios, including what happens if cities (including London) are locked down. Exactly why it then got leaked and by whom is another issue. War-gaming different scenarios sounds like a perfectly sensible approach, and implies that there is an attempt to draw up a multi-faceted strategy, which would make a nice change, as there doesn't seem to have been one (or, at least, there appear to have been several mutually contradictory ones) since restrictions started to ease."
