"There’s a beautiful photo on front page of Oz today of a family, packed up with their camping equipment, setting off for the weekend (in SA) now that travel restrictions are lifted. They look sooooo happy!!!I am dreaming of throwing a swag in the car and heading off behind Sydney for a week, doing. A mix of camping and motels. Do a drag immediately west of the Blue Mountains from Hartley to Goulburn then back through Robertson, slowly. We tend to ignore our immediate backyard. And I’m thinking, maybe I will find somewhere I wouldn’t even mind living. Sydney in the pandemic has made me realise what a rat race ‘normal’ is now, and how much quality of life we have lost. It’s been fabulous being able to get across town in half an hour without cussing. I don’t want to go back to it.So, what are your immediate travel relief plans?"
"If possible at all, we will be going to Port Douglas fro 10 days July school holidays. We is myself, wife, kids and grandkids, 12 in total. If that fails, we will go to in East Gippsland where my daughter and SiL own a very secluded bush property."
"Unfortunately we have to stay home. Chairman Dan has other plans for us poor Victorians as he still hasn't reached his target of getting the budget back in black by fining us for breaches of the lockdown.Edited: 3:57 am, May 15, 2020 "
When travel restrictions are eased allowing overnight stops I’m looking at a few nights at Halls Gap or heading over to the bushfire affected areas of east Gippsland and the south coast of NSW probably during the winter or spring term breaks. Longer term when state borders are fully open heading over to Tasmania on the SPOT for a lazy couple of weeks of touring would be something to look forward to.
"We had a trip planned to Japan in January. We have all our winter clothes ready and the kids are so excited to see snow! Looks like we won't make it to Japan so we are now planning for Tasmania in winter next year.For a mini break, we are off to Blackdown Tablelands soon!"
"Hi,>> Sydney in the pandemic has made me realise what a rat race ‘normal’ is now, and how much quality of life we have lost. It’s been fabulous being able to get across town in half an hour without cussing. I don’t want to go back to it.<<Hear, hear. I traveled to Sydney's Covid central (Waverley) from ""God's waiting room"" Port Macquarie. It took me four hours and one minute ride time going down and four hours eleven minutes coming back with the school zones. Amazing !!!It'll have to wait until 2021 but a ski trip to NZ will be our first travel when things open up.Cheers,"
Take the trip to Kangaroo island that I was supposed to go to next week - tourism has been hit hard there twice now but as soon as accomadation is open for bookings I will go. I just got my booking put on hold.
"Until interstate and international travel restrictions are lifted we won't be going anywhere. I simply dont see the point of travelling and spending money just because you can. And with overnight temps in most of our regions at around 1degree C I'd rather stay home by the fire.We can already do regional travel in SA BTW.Edited: 12:15 am, May 15, 2020 "
"Hi Nozzie, if you post referred to mine then yes i know technically i can travel next week but the airB&B I had my booking with have not reopened yet (they need to ensure they comply with cleaning regimes etc) so until they open (camping grounds are only just now opening) then my trip has had to wait. They are holding my accomadation booking and my ferry booking was cancelled back in March so I'll need to rebook that. I actually don't mind touring in winter - less crowded, i like the cold and I always book a cosy place to stay, I particularly like rugged coastlines in winter and a good excuse for some wine and gin tasting :-)"
Cromansydney2 Just heard the Qld Government are talking about 10 July for start of interstate travel.
"@11, Thanks for that. That could work for us as our school holidays finish on 17th July. from 10th to 19th gives us 8 nights. We can live with that.Part of the problem is that accommodation providers seem to be very inflexible. They won't refund if we cannot go, which IMO is unreasonable in current circumstances."
"Qld schools go back on 13 July so wouldn't think most accommodation places would be very busy after the 10th. You could probably leave booking until much closer to the time. We had booked non refundable accommodation in Kakadu for June and we were lucky to receive a full refund which was a surprise as thought they would likely only offer a credit voucher. We may head up to Port Douglas July/Aug but will be outside school holidays and will probably only book the accommodation the week before, but then we will drive so don't have to worry about booking flights."
"We travelled today. After some 6 weeks of isolation in our retirement village unit in Ashfield, we drove 11 km to Oliveto Ristorante in Rhodes, where we had a lovely lunch with 8 other people. Very civilized.When Queensland opens its border, we are thinking of driving up to Brisbane along the Pacific Highway, then back on the New England Highway, eating at some of the excellent restaurants along the way."
Happy to travel just in WA this year. Heading to Pemberton next week and Albany the following week. And Yallingup a little later.We hopefully will be able travel a little further in the state in a few months when more intra state borders are lifted.Next year will be I hope parts of the east.Must say it’s quite exciting to plan holidays in Australia.
@13. Our problem is that there are 12 of us. Must for us is a house with a heated pool for our use only. We want total privacy. It is hard to find on very short notice.
"I noticed pre lockdown that Britz had fabulous deals on campervans Adelaide to Broome.....would need lots of time though. How much time do you reckon, if you were to do properly via Eyre Peninsula,Esperance, Albany, Margaret River?"
4weeks one way would be enough.
I'm hoping to go to Brisbane for Riverfire at the end of September. Obviously there's a few ifs involved between now and then.
"When would you plan this? Me personally I could spend about three weeks between Broome and Perth . Eyre Peninsula and over to Perth, 2 weeks. Just depends on your pace and how much you have available . I could take even longer though :)"
"I had to cancel/postpone a complicated trip to North Queensland in July, which included a trip on the Savannahlander train. I'm hoping to re-book in August/September if we are allowed to travel and things are open again. The thought of the next three months in cold Victoria is not inviting."
"Well Hami you can always take longer but we have done a comprehensive EP and southern WA from ADL in 2weeks and also a return to/from Broom incl GRR in 4 weeks which is why I said 4 weeks one way which I think is ample.Also years ago did a camping trip from Broome to ADL including some of southern WA in 3 weeks. .Edited: 4:05 am, May 16, 2020 "
"#18- for your planning:Around 5 days for Eyre Peninsula plus Nullarbor. From Esperance through the south ( to allow some relaxation time and exploring) allow at least 7 days- ideally 10 days.From Perth to Exmouth/ Coral Bay- maybe 3 or 5 days To get there then allow several days around Ningaloo. So maybe 10 days Perth to Ningaloo including time there.Then an overnight or more through to Broome- more nights if you add Karijini.Then depending on what you want to do around Broome/Kimberley then around a week.That’s my take on the trip- of course you could add days and take off a few.Edited: 6:13 am, May 16, 2020 "
Oh my goodness Nozzie. I have posted my opinion.. You have yours. I was not contradicting you. Why do you always take things so personally when someone dares to differ . I clearly said ME PERSONALLY....
"Yvwords, if you a age to do the Savannahlander, do let us know how it goes. Have been considering combining that with the Gulflander at some point in the future. Looks really interesting and something a bit different for sure."
"Thanks for those estimates, they are all appreciated. Will probably err on the five week side and make sure we have time to see stuff and chill time too. Hamiriver, I will be back for advice later on. Karijini and Ningaloo definitely. I’ve just finished Tim Winton’s Island Home and it’s quite inspired me.My avatar is the Savannahlander railway at Mt Surprise. A tiny place on the map, fly blown, dusty but really appealing somehow. I found the drive across the Cape to be much more than just something to be done, could easily have spent a couple more days. I think the remoteness is much of the appeal."
Hami I post when or because I have actually done the journey. For me its not just a feeling or an opinion or an idea.
PS I also know grey nomads who do it regularly and take 3 months for the return but that is an entirely different way of travel.
"Amo Mondo, I've actually been on the Savannahlander many years ago, when it was a regular mixed goods/ freight train with one passenger carriage added. It was a great experience, and I hope to do it again on the revived train. I took a credit note on my deposit, which is valid for another 13 months, so I anticipate doing the trip eventually. There are a couple of third party agents, including Queensland Rail, who book trips which include part of the train ride, but if you book directly with the Savannahlander, they have a range of trips, including one which also includes a ride on the Gulflander train. It's quite difficult to DIY, because the connections between different legs of the trip are limited and complicated. Definitely worth doing, though, amazing outback country. I hope they survive the pandemic shutdown.Edited: 9:51 pm, May 16, 2020 "
I have a credit with oaks hotels due to a covid-19 cancellation and am thinking Port Douglas
"A cabin in a caravan park, up in the Port Stephens area. Load up on local beer, wine, cheese and oysters. Spend the weekend chilling and fishing."
I like the way you think Poida :)
"Cheers Beachbum, simple pleasures.Still got road and camping trips to plan, but this one comes first."
"I really have no idea yet where I'll go as there are lots of places on my Aussie bucket list. I was meant to be flying to Europe TONIGHT for a 4 week trip (sad face).Port Stephens, Broome, Brisbane. It's getting chilly here so I'll want to go somewhere warm that's for sure."
"Poida, I was only recounting today your experience of a bikie’s birthday when someone told me they were thinking of camping at Bendeela. They are considering Plan B, thx."
"Haha Sasanqua, it’s a memory I hold dear. Nice blokes. We were missing some bbq tongs in the morning, but as they left a fireplace with some decent glowing logs we moved to our fire, we consider it a fair trade.I believe Bendeela has changed a lot over the years, and is a bit more policed these days, but free camping attracts all colourful types. Saw a Druid circle there once as well. Never a dull moment!"
Another one interested in the Gulflander / Savannalander - so report back.
"Yes, will do. We might even make it later this year, fingers crossed, and I'd like to support local enterprises in far north Queensland. It was very sad cancelling all the bookings I'd spent so much time planning and making. Fortunately, all my accommodation bookings were cancellable without penalty, and I elected to take credit notes from Qantas and the Savannahlander, because I'm determined to get there eventually."
