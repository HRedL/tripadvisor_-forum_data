"I have planned to fly in to Denver May 16 and out May 30. Due to the COVID 19, would you suggest I go ahead and reschedule for a later date?"
Yes
#2 vote for yes!
"Even without COVID-19, your planned itinerary through Colorado that you posted earlier would work better at a later date. Definitely postpone your trip."
Yes.
Thank you all so much
"Yes, there's a good chance we could still be in the lockdown Mid-May or even longer..."
They are ending the lock down May 8th. Just a Fyi...
"The stay-at-home has been changed to a safer-at-home and there are still restrictions. For example this - ""Restaurants will have to continue delivery, window, curbside delivery or walk- or drive-throughs to serve food."" And this - ""Gatherings of 10 people or more will remain prohibited in public spaces and private commercial spaces. People are also ordered to limit their social interactions as much as possible and their essential travel within their county or residence and recreational travel no farther than 10 miles from their residence."" So we aren't encouraged to travel everywhere in the state even though we are residents. The order allows any county or municipality to enforce stricter orders. One county to the west of Denver, Clear Creek county has closed off all county roads to non-residents. Meaning only I-70 and US-6 are open to tourists.So imho, wait."
"It sux but, if we can't go neither can you. ;)JK... I'm burning for a getaway."
"Randy, we have a second home in Buena Vista, and we have been asked to stay away for another month. While we are anxious to get there, we also realize why the small rural towns need to protect themselves from outsiders. Since we are coming from another state, we are considered outsiders. Chaffee County is allowing vacation rentals as of June 1. It will be interesting to see how that impacts things."
"Today in a news conference Denver's mayor announced that beginning May 6 folks there will be required to wear face masks that cover the nose and mouth. Not the ones with the vent (they can't have holes). They're to be worn while inside businesses or while waiting to enter businesses.No end date for the order.Edited: 12:46 am, May 02, 2020 "
Thanks for all the info guys. Please keep us updated on the airport restrictions ( are there any right now ? Quarantine if you’re sick ? ) and local openings. I plan on end of July In golden and Denver area. Please let me know how things are in these Regions as time goes by. Appreciate it .
"Naster, you should follow this thread for updates. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g28927…"
"Gales, Thanks !"
"Galex, I just looked and it doesn’t say anything about quarantine or airport restrictions. I meant to say I do follow government websites but I guess I wanted To just get inside information from people who travel in and out of CO and what their experiences are. I know right is too early to tell but maybe by mid June we will have some reports of how local tourism is."
"One thing to know is that everyone inside the Denver airport must wear a mask. Not the kind with a vent that is used by dirt bikers but a real mask that covers the nose and mouth. The major airlines are also requiring the wearing of masks so don't take it off when you arrive. Overall CO is asking folks to wear masks when they are outside. I take one with me when I walk the neighborhood just in case the situation arises where I might need to put one on. I avoid trails that I know I can't be social distancing if I meet someone due to the narrowness of the trail. And I always wear one inside buildings. Read an interesting article by psychiatrists the other day about why folks may not wear masks (besides the fact they can be uncomfortable). They said it signals that you have fear and are weak. I'm ok with that message because I'm sending a message that I care about the health and well-being of others.Wish we could be more specific. But everyday it seems there is a new challenge. If you come you need to be flexible, and have lowered expectations because some facilities and attractions may either be closed or have very limited use."
