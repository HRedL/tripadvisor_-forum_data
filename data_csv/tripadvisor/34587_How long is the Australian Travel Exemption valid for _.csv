"Hi AllDoes anyone know how long the travel exemption is valid for? My husband got his visa to Australia and exemption approved on the 20th of July - but due to Scomo capping international flights - we can not book a flight home until late October (we are currently in the USA) because that is when Melbourne airport starts to receive international flights. Are the exemptions only valid for 3 months ? If we don't travel soon, will we forfeit it and have to apply again for another exemption? Hope someone can helpEdited: 9:48 pm, August 15, 2020 "
"I agree with Luigi, don’t delay your flights until Melbourne reopens, book onto the first available flight into Australia and then quarantine wherever you land. There is no guarantee that Melbourne will start up their quarantine program again come October. If the last 6 months has taught us anything it’s to not assume anything."
"I agree, Change the city. Melbourne are extending the 'Lock Down "" for 4 more weeks.Good Luck"
"Melbourne is extending the State of Emergency as announced today but not the lockdown which still has a date of September 13, (hopefully) but I think renewal of International arrivals into Melbourne will be a while yet.Edited: 2:43 am, August 16, 2020 "
Meant to say Victoria has extended State of Emergency.
"""Book a flight to Sydney or Brisbane.""This is not so simple - my elderly neighbour died a week ago having been terminally ill for some months. Her daughter, who lives in Brisbane, eventually managed to get permission to leave Australia and arrived here just the day before her mother passed. She had a flight back to Brisbane booked for 19th August, which has now been cancelled and at the moment she has no idea when she will be able to return to her home, her family and her business after completing her fourteen days quarantine. I live out in the country in a part of the UK that has a very low infection rate and where most of the population have been very compliant with the rules but the airlines require a negative Covid test which cannot be done in this area and which involves a trip to an area with a much higher rate of infection in order to get the correct test done and where the results are available in the restricted time scale."
"Luigi I think you missed my point - regardless of the difficulties of getting a test done within the required time period relative to departure, the problem is that flights are being cancelled with very little warning and the seats are just not available, even if prepared to pay the extra to travel Business Class. It is all very well to say book a flight to Brisbane but this is the problem - if one could book a flight and have some certainty that it would actually take off then the problems would be much less."
"I have to agree with Judy, wherever you are travelling from there are problems in getting a valid PCR test. Many (most?) airlines and transit stops require a test taken not less than 72 or 96 hours before your flight and transit time. Many countries will not give you your result in less than 24 or 48 hours and that may be delayed.Also the governments ploys to limit Australians returning can cause airlines to bump passengers at the last minute. That happened to us last week where we had valid bookings and our PCR test papers but at check in they couldn’t board us. Luckily they gave us seats on the next flight (48 hours later), even then we couldn’t relax as they could have kicked us off our flight or stuck us in transit as our flight was 3 hours after the 96 hours and the transit was 8 hours after.Had we not got that flight the next available flight was in November. At least one person was kicked off that flight.So no guarantee of Australians being allowed back this year but today the news mentioned that they plan to allow 300 foreign students to take some of the limited hotel quarantine quota in South Australia as a test run.???? WTF is the government thinking."
"Not sure if your logic Guru, lots of expats earn big $ that they bring back to Australia. Lots of Aussies who are stuck overseas because they can’t get a flight/quarantine slot are now transferring money out of Australia to pay their daily expenses. That is money not being spent in Australia and not employing Australians. Plus the students are paying very little tax compared to the thousands each month paid by Australians when they return."
"Absolutely right Neal. My neighbour's daughter is an Australian citizen and has a business to run in Australia and presumably pays her taxes the same as all other Australians. She only left the country ten days ago for compassionate reasons and it now appears that she is not able to return following her mother's funeral to do her quarantine and resume running her Australian business. She has now had two flights cancelled and has no immediate prospect of being able to return this month and probably next month also. Of course she will have to transfer funds from Australia to support herself, but she certainly is not choosing to spend her $ overseas. I find it very difficult to swallow the fact that Australia is allowing foreign students above its own citizens."
"I do agree that Aussies should come before foreign students.Having said that, your friend Judy left in middle pf a pandemic. Surely, she didn't expect to have smooth sailing coming back home. And before you say that it is easy for me to say that, and that she had to be there for her mother's funeral, I missed out of my father's funeral, my brother's funeral and other family member's funerals and there was no pandemic then. That is what happens when you choose to live on a different continent."
"And presumably this is why they’ve made it so difficult to get an exemption to leave in the first place - that unless you are able to support yourself indefinitely overseas and have no need to return, you should not be leaving.I am increasingly uncomfortable with the govt’s de facto removal of the right to return to one’s own country via restriction of quarantine places, but am prepared to go along with it for a bit longer. Much longer and they are going to have to come up with an alternative as visas and people’s ability to support themselves overseas expire. Any capacity to quarantine should be prioritised to returning Australians, not foreign students."
"No of course not, agreed. I was meaning people who left before this started or in the very early days and have been stuck overseas for months and who’ve had multiple flights cancelled etc.As I said, anyone leaving now/ last month or two must be prepared to not come back til this thing is over."
"While I hear what you are saying Judybrit, your friend would have known the issues before leaving the country.For many weeks now this has been happening.A person I know here had brother that was very ill, as much as he wanted to see him,he told me that the complexity of getting back to Thailand and then back here was just too much risk. He holds both Thai and Australian Passports and also worked for the Thai Embassy in Australia and gets Thai Pension.As for the Students , my understanding is that the flight is charter from Singapore. The people coming in will be paying for the full costs as far as I know. The people coming back now only pay 3000 AUD. This only pays part of the costs. They are going to Adelaide , at one time it was going to be Canberra. SA gets a lot of Federal Funding to prop up the state so it does sort of may sense.Good Luck"
"""I am increasingly uncomfortable with the govt’s de facto removal of the right to return to one’s own country via restriction of quarantine places, but am prepared to go along with it for a bit longer."" Sasanqua - and when that ""bit longer"" expires, then what will you do? The Govt will do what it likes, when it likes, until such time as there is an election or a court case bought against them. I, for one, empathise but do not sympathise with anyone who chose to leave during a pandemic."
"Not talking about people who left during the pandemic (as I indicated in my posts). I'm talking about those who left beforehand and for valid reasons. Its not all black and white, goodies and baddies. If a vaccine is not found for another year or more, it's not reasonable for people to be refused re entry.The current arrangements were meant to be temporary, as ScoMo has indicated and should this become much longer term, then Govt will have to facilitate people returning. As our govt has proven through this thing, it has ample intellectual and organisational capacity to get things done and can be nimble when required."
"As long as he remembers that Lukashenko is a great guy and the last election was absolutely fair, he'll have no problem....:)"
"I was meaning people who left before this started or in the very early days and have been stuck overseas for months and who’ve had multiple flights cancelled etc.____________No one is “stuck” overseas that hasn’t chosen to be either through lack of effort, waiting too long to return, unwillingness to pay the price to return, waiting for the Australian Government to bail them out or many other reasons of their own choosing. To say otherwise is ridiculous. There was one on the local radio complaining they had been trying to get home from India since May, not February or even March, May. They now think they should be brought home at the Australian Governments expense because their visa is expiring soon, their work contract is coming to an end and they have checked “the app” for flights every day but they are not close to a major airport so need a regional flight. I mean the ABC of all media gave this idiot credence by doing the story.Travel is not one of life’s necessities, unless you are a refugee fleeing persecution. It’s a choice, pure and simple."
"Oh Luigi, dreaming of Balmain and I will have to dream for quite awhile!"
"Melissa, for many people travel is a necessity. Unless you want to be demoted/ fired by refusing your employer can require you to travel overseas (my daughter last year). Or to get job opportunities in sectors not in Australia ( my niece currently in LA). Or study programmes not offered in Australia ( my nephew previously in Italy).As for your ludicrous claim that people have chosen not to take the opportunity to return; that is like saying “let them eat cake”. There are no seats available FOR ANY MONEY from some countries. For my flight there was only slots for my family and 2 others. There are no seats available for 2 months. There are a few other options but they are all risky (getting stranded mid journey in a country you don’t have a visa for isn’t worth the risk).Of course one option I was shown was to charter a private jet, fly to a seaport nearer Australia and then charter a boat to an Australian territory. That option costs more than a house in parochial Newcastle and yes I even considered it as a fallback but my wife doesn’t like the water."
"Neal there are exceptions. However in vast majority of cases, people left it too late to get back to Australia, either not taking it seriously in the beginning or expecting the govt to fetch them when things got tough.I was reading on the weekend about a family stuck in Croatia. Well I was in Croatia when the govt urged pope to come back home. It took me 5 seconds to make the decision to come back and I booked the first available flight. Yet I have an apartment, my own car, huge extended family and friends in Croatia. The family I was reading about, hardly know anybody over there. Why on earth did they wait until it was too late.Another case is a couple that went to Africa in March to do some charity work. They left their kids here. Now they are screaming for help as their kids need them. Sorry, no sympathy for them either."
"Luigi, that could’ve extremely expensive and some people might not be able to afford it. That is why they should have either stayed home when pandemic was announced, or they should have made extra effort to come home as soon as things got serious."
"Luigi, not everybody has the option of staying where they are and waiting it out. Personally I could of stayed until next year, but that makes me an exception. Plenty don’t have their own home overseas, plenty don’t have the funds to be stranded for a year paying for hotels and medical care. And then there are legal issues such as visas expiring, overstaying visas, big fines and/or imprisonment for overstaying in many countries. Then there are safety concerns such as revolutions (Mali this week), natural disasters, wars and social unrest (would you stay in Belarus?)"
"""It took Matthew Flinders eight years to get home after his third voyage.""I didn't think of Trim. I thought he probably couldn't get a flight!"
"Sorry Neal, but those are just excuses. If people want to travel to places that are risky for whatever reason, they have to be prepared to wear the consequences. Individuals need to take more responsibility themselves for their own actions. Why does the government have to always step in?"
"Cromansydney, did I ask for the government to step in? I just want them to step out of the way. It is the government that is directing airlines to deny passengers boarding. It is the governments at state levels that have bungled the quarantine system, it is government that is spending hundreds of billions on welfare for those in Australia and fully taxes Australians temporarily stuck overseas ( but won’t return one cent to us whilst we are stranded, that includes the Medicare levy that they still bill us when we can’t access it)."
"Neal, whatever. It’s ludicrous to talk about the difficulty in returning now, people should have returned months ago. So yes, let them eat cake and if they want to return now they can spend the equivalent of a house on it because the situation they are in is of their own making.Plus anyone who needs to move countries at the behest of their employer obviously have options, they won’t be minimum wage employees will they. It usually comes down to the fact that the move is in their own interest, not a necessity. The education you seek is also a choice. None of which is the responsibility of any government, it’s called personal responsibility. Not that you’ll respond sensibly to any of these points of course, you’ll just make further excuses or quote specific non typical examples and I really can’t be bothered any more."
Actually Luigi it was a gripe about the incompetence of the Australian embassy. The advice at the time was to contact the embassy to notify them that we were there. At that time (late March) everything was uncertain and the advice from Smarttraveller was to give our details to the embassy.
"Melissa, they are hardly non typical examples. Just a single Facebook group for Australians stranded in India has 2000 members. How many thousands more are not on Facebook or are in the 200 other countries. Many are in an ok situation but many others are pretty desperate (look at the numbers of Australians stuck overseas who have died as they can’t access medical care or the number of suicides).As for putting down the millions of Australians over the years who have travelled overseas for work or education i’d just point out that they are the ones who are most likely creating the wealth that sustains your welfare payments in declining Newcastle"
"DFAT say they have 18,000 Aussies registered with them who still want to come home - technically could be all done in 5 weeks but practically a lot longer due to flight schedules, bumping off flights, ticket cost etc etchttps://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/au…Edited: 4:08 am, August 20, 2020 "
"Hi, I see that Luigi responded to the original question in post #1, but I just wanted to note that this is indeed the correct answer — the exemption is valid for as long as your current visa is valid. Below is a copy of what my exemption email said (I received mine @ the end of May). Keep in mind the “Effective March 28” stuff mentioned at the end is presumably very different now. Dear , I refer to your enquiry via the online Australian immigration enquiry form.Thank you for providing the required documents to demonstrate you are an immediate family member of an Australian Citizen or Permanent Resident. I have considered your documents and determined that you are exempt from Australia’s travel restrictions. This exemption has been recorded in our systems and you may now travel to Australia while your current visa is valid. There is no documentation I can provide you to guarantee entry in to Australia - Australia’s visa system is electronic and your details are recorded.Please note that when you arrive at the airport, the check-in procedure may take a little longer than usual as the airline will need to contact Australia’s Border Operation Centre (the Airline will have the phone number) to get approval for you to board the plane. Upon arrival in Australia, you and any other person you are travelling with will be required to enter quarantine. Please also be aware that effective from 11:59pm (AEDT) Saturday 28 March 2020:• All travellers arriving in Australia will be required to undertake their mandatory 14-day quarantine at designated facilities (for example, a hotel), in their port of arrival.• Travellers will be transported directly to designated facilities after appropriate immigration, customs and enhanced health checks.• Designated facilities will be determined by the relevant state or territory government and will ordinarily be in the city of entry where the traveller has cleared immigration, but facilities in other areas may be used if required.• These requirements will be implemented under state and territory legislation and will be enforced by state and territory governments.Further information can be found on the Department of Health’s website at: https:/…novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov Please note that this assessment does not imply that you will meet the criteria for grant of a visa should you apply for a Partner/Parent/Child visa.**** PLEASE DO NOT REPLY TO THIS EMAIL****"
