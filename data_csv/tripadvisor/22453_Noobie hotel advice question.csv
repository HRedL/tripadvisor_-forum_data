"I'm not sure you'll get any encouragement here Mike. I guess people will tell you to check on the latest Cancun forum posts to get an idea of what's the current situation.True, a lot can happen in a month, but it looks like in April you'd be sailing to a desolate no man's land and worst of all, without much alcohol.
