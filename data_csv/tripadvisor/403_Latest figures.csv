"It's been a while since I reported the numbers of cases, so here's the latest situation:Throughout Turkey, as of this evening:65,446 tests of which 9,982 positive568 in ICU, of which 394 requiring support to breathe131 dead, 105 recovered"
That is some escalation since the time (last week?) there were purported to be zero or just two cases in the whole country!
"Seven days ago, there were 1,236 cases, but yes. It certainly appears that there were more than just one or two cases a fortnight ago, and that these had the time to spread.At the moment, the trajectory is super-Italian. What's worse, the first quarantined zones are all of them rural, which suggests it has dispersed throughout the country, and I doubt we can catch them all before things become serious.But in Istanbul, as you will see from the pictures on the Istanbul thread, most people are staying inside."
Stay healthy G.G.Thanks for the info.
"Thank you, Andy. You too. :)"
"I read on the Mugla Forum everyone was asked to stay n Sunday and Monday a voluntary 48 hour lock down and the virus may peak in 2 weeks. I really think this is very, very, wishful thinking. It is still only over 65’s that are being kept indoors. There is no compulsory lock down for all, just yet, but I suspect it will come.Edited: 3:47 am, March 30, 2020 "
"Frances-Jane yes, the government asked for a 48-hour-long voluntary lockdown, throughout the country. They're obviously looking to defer a full lockdown if possible.I'm not sure such a deferral is a good idea, but part of the problem is that parts of the country remain uninfected - hence the lack of information on where the most cases are - and if it comes, I suspect it will be on a province-by-province basis. Easy enough to enforce in Istanbul, maybe, but difficult elsewhere, given the plethora of country roads and tracks."
"One lady I know who lives in Fethiye is 70 so has to stay in. Amazing that she had a delivery of fish and chips in a cardboard box and put image of it on F.B. and is letting everyone know this restaurant, although closed to the public, is delivering food. In the U.K. all these places have been closed down and no deliveries. We have also been warned that the virus can live on cardboard for a long time.I think people have not got to grips with the reality of how serious this virus is."
"FJ - are all your delivery places closed there? Here in the north east almost all our takeaways are open and delivering and restaurants have turned into take aways where possible. The delivery drivers are absolutely run off their feet!Edited: 8:30 am, March 30, 2020 "
"Yes, The Police Have the power to close down any place. There were some places open last week but they have been closed down.The last take away from a local restaurant was on Mothers Day. They closed the next day.Amazed that take aways are still running in England. This could be a real source of catching the virus.Edited: 10:23 am, March 30, 2020 "
"Given the hygiene at some of our local takeaways, you are always playing Salmonella Russian Roulette whenever you order something in!"
"Yes you can still go in most of them and pick them up, the PM asked if any restaurants could turn into a take away to do so and yesterday I got an email from trip advisor saying support your local take aways. Our local papers have released information on all take aways available in each area.Edited: 11:36 am, March 30, 2020 "

Fortunately, other than latex gloves everything is still available at either of the two nearest shops to me - a Şok and a BTT (sort of like a cash & carry) - so I just do my best to avoid contact, though the lady at the checkout at Şok seems not to understand distancing. :)Anyways, the numbers for today:106,799 tests of which 15,679 positive979 in ICU, of which 692 require intubation"

And, indeed, if you look at the videos posted online, the larger cities are absolutely deserted, with checkpoints at impossible-to-avoid places."
"The daily death rate in Turkey is increasing, but only very, very slowly, a lot slower than other countries crateegg"
"Maybe demographics? I now know four people in Istanbul who've been diagnosed positive. Two in their fifties, two in their thirties, all sitting it out at home, one with a mild fever, one with a persistent cough, two hitherto asymptomatic.The number of people who're 80+ in Turkey is relatively low, and they've generally been in total lockdown longer than the goverment has required (including my mother, who's been stuck in her flat in Ankara since 7th March).Edited: 1:51 pm, April 12, 2020 "
"Oh, and the current medications used are:1. Asymptomatic and mild (stay at home cases) diagnosed cases as well as possible casesSubject to doctor's approval: hydoxychloroquine and/or oseltamivir (as the text suggests, this is not because early use has been proved effective in this case or even necessary, but better safe than sorry)2.

""Serious"" cases requiring ICU: Hydoxychloroquine and/or favipiravir and azithromycin (note the change: this is the Avigan drug developed in japan and which we're buying from China)4.

Children all playing together in the street, holding hands in a circle. The Police arrived and they all scattered back into their apartments, one hid under a car. It is a shame their parents do not realise if one has the virus, they will pass it to all the children, who will then take it back to their families.

"Thanks for the updates, G-G, and my best wishes to you and your mother.My viewpoint here in Selçuk is perhaps unusual: my house is very old (all stone and wood), and when I sit in the kitchen my face is level with the street outside. My personal lock-down has forced me to do a little house-work, not least cleaning the kitchen windows, so I now see what's happening first-hand, in this farming community on the edge of town.I was surprised to see the Syrian family up the street mostly observing the week-end lock-up. They arrived 4 years ago and have produced at least one more child each year since, whose time is mostly spent playing in the street with the sand left after the multiple street-works of the last few years. They're a joy to see in these days.All my other neighbours are Kurdish, and for once they obeyed instructions too, up to a point. Meanwhile I was driven insane on the Friday night when, from 11.30 to half past midnight, the tannoy on the corner repeated – every 15 minutes - “Attention all citizens! There is no need to panic! - mumble – mumble - mumble – I repeat, there is no need to panic!”I guess I did what everyone else was doing and got straight out onto the street to ask what was going on. That's not quite true: I just got in my car and drove out into the hills behind the town to escape the sound.On the Sunday, a bread van came round the streets announcing itself loudly. The driver and staff all wore masks and gloves, of course."
"Oops. that's a cumulative *4*10,556 tests, and 34,456 today. :)"
"GG, thank you for your updates. I'm just wondering what you think about the stated death figures. It seems a bit strange that it was 70 something for several days, and now 90 something for several days. It just doesn't seem to follow the patterns of other countries."
"@Robert: Good to hear from you, and, my, what a cosmopolitan town Selçuk is! My neighbours are nowhere near as interesting. Or fecund, though that's probably due to age. I live in a small apartment building with five other families, and I have trouble hearing them at the best of times. I've not seen any of them for weeks, though I do check up (by phone) on my immediate neighbour, who's in her 80s or 90s and isolating from her family, who've moved out.I didn't even know of the previous curfew until the next morning, when things were unnaturally quiet! :) But the müezzins are wailing something in the distance before the last prayers of the day, every night."
"@MapLady, as far as I can tell, it seems to stem from a number of different factors.1. The data for the people recovered isn't all that brilliant either, with the death-to-recovery ratio in Turkey currently around 1:3. That's not a good ratio, so I'm inclined to think that they're reporting deaths correctly-ish. In addition, looking at various sites, I get the impression that people die after about two-to-three weeks of struggling with this illness. Two-and-a-half weeks ago, the number of people who tested positive in Turkey was 5,698.Remember that the cases in Turkey are following, say, the UK with a lag of about a week. It stands to reason that the deaths will lag a bit too. I would expect a jump next week.2. The demographic structure is different, and all the elderly people I know are isoltaing very, very strictly, and have been doing so, some (my doing) since before the first case was reported. In the UK, 18% of the population is over 65 versus 8.5% in Turkey. Remember that the fatality rates don't really get icky until you're over 70. Looking at ICU usage, there certainly doesn't seem to be much pressure.3. There are more tests being done in Turkey than the UK. Put another way, if they test you in the UK, you have something like a 30% chance of proving positive; in Turkey, the ratio is about 15%. It's possible that this level of testing is also revealing a lot of people who have mild or asymptomatic cases, who wouldn't normally be expected to deteriorate.4a. The Turks claim that the use of favipiravir is reducing the incidence of serious cases, and they seem to be giving it out early to those most at risk. The Chinese were the first to say this, but everyone else seems to be awaiting clinical trials. Since the Turks are throwing the kitchen sink at the illness, they're not waiting for the results. 4b. The Turks are also using lopinavir/ritonavir which are anti-HIV drugs, and claim these have some success. The Russians are the biggest proponent of this at the moment.4a and 4b are not being used in the UK, for example. https:/… Nor is the UK using hydroxychloroquine (which may indeed be useless).Now, I've asked doctors I know whether any of these will help, and they've been cautious, saying it's too early to tell. It could be that 4a and 4b do not contribte to low fatality rates.5. People who've recovered are queuing up to donate blood for an antique therapy using convalescent serum. Basically, the antibodies in recovered patients start the work of healing those who've recently falen ill, while their oen bodies start to crank up their own response. The doctors I sppke with were far more confident about this than the drug cocktails; it is, apparently, the only known (and very effective) way of treating Ebola, for example.In short: I don't *know*, because this is all way over my head, but these spring to mind."
"Thank you, Frances-Jane, that's very kind of you to say.Wll, we try, and these are trying times! :) I do hope that I shall at least be able to take a walk outside - in June! :)Keep well!"
"Thank you F-J ! I count myself very lucky not to be living in an apartment block. I do at least have a small courtyard with a single lemon tree, where I can get some air. And a slice of lemon goes well in my afternoon tea.It is immensely frustrating, especially as you may have noticed I enjoy a lot of travelling within Turkey.As soon as I'm permitted, or perhaps a bit sooner, I shall be on the road north again to Pergamum, Troy and Çanakkale.Meanwhile I keep busy with solving and setting crosswords, completing a 1,000 piece jigsaw (3 times over!) and doing a little housework. Right now I have some leeks, carrots, parsley, lemon juice and olive oil on the stove - for a supply of ""zeytinyağlı pırasa""."

"That really doesn't mean that much crateegg. Given the progression of the pandemic. it is to be expected that Turkey, with its larger population, would move up the ranks. In fact, I had been expecting Turkey to outstrip the UK by now, especially with the much higher testing numbers here. The UK, in my opinion, is under-reporting Covid-19 cases: the lack of adequate testing in the UK means that for every test done there, you have about a one-third chance of proving positive, whereas in Turkey the ratio is trending to one-tenth.Once I can get together a few graphs, I'll give further details on why we're relatively sanguine.Edited: 2:13 am, April 20, 2020 "
"The reason the UK is under-reporting Covid-19 cases: is that the figures are related to hospitals only, and not care homes, if these were included, the numbers would be considerably higher crateegg"
"OK. First of all, may I recommend this site: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data# . You can do all sorts of wonderful analyses there, as opposed to just looking up the raw numbers.Now, onto the analysis:First, you're right, the number of cases in Turkey has risen. If you compare it with countries like France or Germany or even Italy, where the trend of daily cases is downwards, then, yes, it stands out, but then its peak is nowehere near as high. And despite lagging the UK by about a week to start with, it seems to have been brought under control a little sooner; both countries are now trending sideways. Not too surprising. Turkey entered into a stricter lockdown than the UK earlier than the UK. Yes, mistakes have been made and observance is not universal. But it seems to be working.https://imgbbb.com/album/L9HhJThis is also borne out by the trend in cumulative figures, in both absolute terms and in cases per million pop. Turkey started off with a far worse trend than the UK - probably because cases slipped through the cracks at the start and more people were infected than we thought when we thought - but then very quickly increased both restrictions and testing.https://imgbbb.com/album/L96yNSecond, both in terms of where the UK was a week or two ago, as well as presently, testing coverage is much better. Which means that we're finding asymptomatic cases more frequently. If you're using the UK as a reference for where things are likely to trend in Turkey, *don't*. Quite apart from the fact (somewhat surprisingly to me) that we seem better equipped in terms of ICU availability, ventilators, all the assorted paraphernalia, and maybe even laboratory nmbers, the UK's testing performance has been really bad, while Turkey's has been better than average. And remember, without testing and contact tracing - last week there were 4,200 teams in Turkey with the sole purpose of ferreting out people who'd encountered Covid-19 sufferers - you cannot contain this virus. And because we're testing mild and asymptomatic cases, this also has an impact on the fatality ratio.https://imgbbb.com/album/L9BATThird, largely due to the difference in the median age but also the aformentioned factors, the fatality ratio has been much lower. Though the number of deaths will surely rise, I would be very surprised if we came anywhere close to more elderly nations.https://imgbbb.com/album/L9AKR (the UK is the unnamed blob, and in fact, I'd recommend you visit the site and play around with this graph yourself. It's quite interesting.)Of course, all things can change very rapidly when it comes to this virus's spread. But at this moment, we are sanguine, though vigilant."
"And if you think Turkey's performance is suspiciously good, take a look at places like New Zealand, Australia, Portugal or Greece. We're just average. Where we stand out is in total cases, and, well, there are almost the same number of people in Turkey as there are in two Spains.Edited: 3:32 am, April 20, 2020 "
"Thanks GG, very interesting"
"A pleasure. I obsess about two things: food and numbers (other than weight) and will continue to provide the numbers as this pandemic progresses.But there is, I do think, room for cautious optimism everywhere other than maybe sub-Saharan Africa. Even there, because of the prevalence of infectious diseases, the infrastructure in some countries at least may be better than we fear.Keep your spirits up, stick to the rules, and be well! :)"
"When assessing the trend in Turkey, it is also worth noting that 38-39% of the population is under permanent curfew (no walking the dog, here); the over-65s since midnight on 21st/22nd March, and (most of) the under-20s since midnight on 4th/5th April.The murder rate might rise, but they'll not be catching or spreading the virus or, if one of their family members is infected and tested, they too will be tested, and the virus caught early.And on a social basis, it's also worth noting that retirement homes are not common in Turkey. And while under normal circumstances, the standard of care for the elderly may be better in them, apparently, during a pandemic, your parents are better living off with you. Even your in-laws. :)Edited: 8:50 am, April 20, 2020 "

Temporary though this may be, it does at least appear we are over the hump in new cases (unlike the numbers above, the following are daily figures): Tests New cases10-Apr... 30,864 .... 4,747 11-Apr... 33,170... 5,138 12-Apr... 35,720 ... 4,789 13-Apr... 34,456... 4,093 14-Apr... 33,070... 4,062 15-Apr... 34,090... 4,281 16-Apr... 40,427... 4,801 17-Apr... 40,270... 4,353 18-Apr... 40,520... 3,783 19-Apr... 35,344... 3,977 20-Apr... 39,703... 4,674 21-Apr... 39,429... 4,611 22-Apr... 37,535... 3,083 23-Apr... 40,962... 3,116 24-Apr... 38,351... 3,122And the number of people recovering is catching up, with a delay of about 2.5-3 weeks: Daily recoveries 10-Apr ... 281 11-Apr ... 542 12-Apr ... 481 13-Apr ... 511 14-Apr ... 842 15-Apr ... 875 16-Apr ... 1,415 17-Apr ... 1,542 18-Apr ... 1,822 19-Apr ... 1,523 20-Apr ... 1,454 21-Apr ... 1,488 22-Apr ... 1,559 23-Apr ... 2,014 24-Apr ... 3,246 Of course, there's no telling whether things will progress as above, but I'm hopeful.(And apologies again for the squigliness.)Edited: 11:10 pm, April 24, 2020 "
"@tlewiskuk: It's relatively straightforward (though not easy) to flatten the curve - you lock everyone up, destroy your economy, and it's done. :) But the real issue is bringing numbers to manageable levels per day - somewhere in the low-to-mid double digits, I guess, for Turkey - and that's contingent on even greater numbers of tests (both swabs and I would hope, some time in May, blood) as well as discipline. And there, I'm not so sure, to be frank. The tail end of this curve may last a long while. But we shall see."
"Data as of 25th April865,565 tests107,773 positiveDeaths 2,706, recoveries 25,58279,485 active casesThe 25th was the second day running when the number of people recovering (3,845) exceeded the number of new cases (2,861). If this continues, we will have hit the peak about a week ahead of schedule."
"I showed this to my husband and he asked me where do these figures come from? I said I had no idea, but possibly the Turkish Government. I am correct G.G. ?"
"GG, is there a worry of a spike once restrictions are relaxed?"
"Hello France-Jane, hope you're all keeping well. The last day's data is here: https://covid19.saglik.gov.tr/ and is usually announced around 8pm. For comparative purposes, though, I use this site: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data which I find more user-friendly than others (you can also easily make graphs and download data).And hello MapLady; I hope all is well with you. Yes, in fact it's being talked of as being inevitable, and that's the consensus. The only question is just how big the spike will be. If we ever get daily numbers down to 50 (and that's a big if), will it spike to 100 or 500 or more? And then there are the religious holidays, in particular Şeker Bayramı. Will the government impose a curfew then (daily numbers are unlikely to be in double digits at that time)? If so, brilliant (and even a little over the top). But if not, then I fear we may undo two weeks' progress in a few days.As President Trump, though no doctor, has so brillianty stated, sunlight kills this on surfaces pretty quickly, and higher temperatures do reduce its half-life in the air. Though we're not going to be taking his advice on full-body or under-the-skin irradiation, no-one's too worried about the summer because the belief is that it can be contained then. The main concern is the autumn and winter and the possibility (like the flu) of a second, serious wave then.As the mother of a former employee of mine, a lab technician educated in the US, said (well, wrote) to me: ""We'll be playing whack-a-mole for a year"". I think she has a point. It may be that rolling quarantines across the country may be the way every country will have to contain this for the next few months.My own mother, on the other hand, who's facing the likelihood of up to a year shut up in her flat (she's joined an activist group in Ankara lobbying for street access for 65+ year-olds, heh), says that multiple waves are necessary to drive it into people's skulls (she used somewhat more colourful language) that this is Serious Business. She also says that while she wants the right to leave her house, she has no intention until everyone wears masks.And I largely agree with most of the above. During my rare forays into the streets to buy one item or another that supermarkets don't seem to have (for example, every April I do a baked garlic cure; isolation is ideal, nay necessary! for that), I have noted that only about 50% of people seem to be wearing masks. There are very - and I do mean very - few people on the streets even during weekdays compared to normal, but of the the 50% who don't wear masks, half (so a quarter of the total) act as though this is all an excuse for a pleasant stroll outside. Fortunately, the converse is also true: about half of the people wearing masks will cross to the other pavement (no traffic to worry about!) when they see me approaching.Until everyone wears masks, whether bought or made, and until everyone at least tries to be diligent, then I'm afraid the possibility exists of what my mother said coming true. At least in Istanbul. This is a numbers and opportunities game. Even if 90% of 15 million people were disciplined, that would still leave 1.5 million lolling about. And as Istanbul has the Bosphorus, it has natural commuter chokepoints: the ferries leaving from the major hubs of Beşiktaş, Eminönü, Üsküdar and Kadıköy. Even if you avoid public transport, you have to take a ferry at some point.Long story short, yes, I do believe a second wave is possible. I will be pleasantly surprised if it is not large.Edited: 9:16 am, April 26, 2020 "
"The other thing to remember when looking at this epidemic is that Turkey is effectively split in two. On the one hand, there is Istanbul (""Turkey's Wuhan"" according to the Minister of Health) where 15 million people live, and which has 65,000 or so cases. And then there's the rest of Turkey - a further 67 million - where there are 45,000 or so cases. It may be that some restrictions will remain in force in Istanbul (let us not forget the municipality also has a say and they're generally far more serious; if it were up to them, we'd be under seven-day-a-week curfew, which is a bit too much, I think) but be phased out elsewhere.And let us never underestimate Turks' (mis)ingenuity. As you know, travel into and out of the more populous provinces has subject to strict conditions for the past few weeks. One of the ways you can get a permit is to run out of money, and either face life on the streets in the place you're visiting or go back to your home. So my darling fellow citizens began to apply in such numbers for an official change of address that the government had to announce no applications would be accepted until mid-May.Edited: 9:26 am, April 26, 2020 "
"Thank you for your detailed reply. Almost everybody in our area appears to be wearing masks, although having said that, I only go out a few times a week to walk to the end of the road and back and don't see many people. Heard that older people may be allowed out for three hours next weekend - that would be wonderful for those like my 69 year old neighbour who lives alone and is going slightly spare with boredom. She even brought round some homemade food for us the other day :) I hope she gets her three hours of freedom, and I hope to see all the over 65s dancing down the street while the rest of us gaze forlornly from our windows. That final paragraph is most interesting indeed. My husband has indeed been threatening to go back to his hometown. Lockdown is getting to people, clearly. Take care of yourselves."

But in general, we seem to have passed the peak. On April 11th, we saw our highest number of cases, exceeding 5,000. After that, a stabilisation followed by a descent. I hope this doesn't cause relaxation. If measures are loosened this curve can just as easily turn up. We have to be extraordinarily cautious, until the outbreak is completely under control.""...And, MapLady: I heard that too. It's an excellent idea, I think, to let the over-65s out for a breath of fresh air when no-one else is around. Lockdown is indeed getting to people, and the elderly don't need that kind of unrelenting pressure. We'll see what happens..."
"Oh, and wrt to the much longer curfew that the Mayor of Istanbul wants, here's a piece by the German ZDF on life in Istanbul during the coronavirus.The mayor appears at around 11:30https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq90vV3ITEs(Yes, he does say he wants a two or three-week curfew., which I think would have been a good idea a month ago, but not today.)"
"Various statements by Erdoğan:The 1st of May being a holiday, the weekend curfew is extended to cover that too, as was previously announced. (I assume that limited shopping will be possible on the weekday, as it was this last week.) They've also decided to continue with the weekend cufrews until after Bayram. Does this mean a four-day curfew over Bayram itself?! At the least I assume we're in for a four day curfew covering 16-19th May to encompass the holiday on the 19th. No info on whether over-65s will be allowed out for a few hours during the curfew.Courts will not be in session until 15th June, this being extended from the previous date of 30th April, various employment measures extended to 27th May. I wonder if that's the date they plan on starting to re-open gradually? But at the least, I'm glad - surprised a bit really - that they're sticking to their guns."

While in the short run, this shouldn't present a problem, if some sort of normality is to return in June, this must be accompanied by higher numbers of tests in order to prevent a repeat of what happened at the start of March, when too few tests were being done and carriers escaped detection.I do hope the Government amends its modus operandum accordingly, which won't be easy - this stage is probably more difficult to manage (though progressively less disruptive) than the one we seem to be moving out of. I don't think we're at South Korean levels of discipline and survellance to be able to relax so quickly."

"As people may have noticed, I've stopped with the daily updates because, well, it was getting a bit boring. For me, certainly, and I'm sure for a fair number of you. Instead I'll provide updates on, say, a weekly basis, and a commentary on how the disease is progressing and the current state of affairs....As of 18th May pm1.65m tests151K cumulative cases. The past week has seen an end to the sharp declines we've recently begun to expect in new case numbers, and the trend is now sideways. The average number of new daily cases since my last post is about 1,550 per day, with wide variations. This is to be expected - reductions in the number of new cases day after day without let up would be unusual. But we do not know whether the new cases are in Istanbul or some other large city, or whether they're caused by extraordinarily stupid people turning up en masse for funerals, paying condolences, or just visiting with others, as the press is reporting. For all I know, Covid-19 may be running rampant through rural areas or all new cases could be in Istanbul.4K deaths, 112K recovered. 35K active cases. As recoveries follow infections with a delay of about 10 days, it is possible that there might be a very slight uptick in the total number of active cases on some days if the daily infection numbers do not start to decline again.It is currently too early to gauge the impact of the modest re-opening measures already taken."

Anyway, I believe this will be good for all of us.I sincerely hope the domestic flight will really resume on 28 May.

But to describe the map in more detail, the riskiest (a relative term - I'd be delighted to see Istanbul in the same colours) part of Selçuk is roughly a triangle with the Devlet Hastanesi as one point, the Temple of Artemis as another, and the Opet Station at Atatürk Caddesi 49 as the third.Some very slightly risky areas elsewhere too.But since you're a resident, you should be able to download the app. It's ""Hayat Eve Sığar"" and available in both the Apple and Android stores."

"Hi GG, and thanks for all your hard work and useful information during this difficult time.I note the figures you have provided and no doubt like here in the UK and across Europe and further the true scale of this pandemic wont be known for over 12 months at the earliest when the figures for rates above the yearly average death rate is known. Here in the UK the figures are truly shocking however feel they will be borne out to be fairly accurate, is there the same confidence in the figures being provided by the Turkish authorities"
"Always a pleasure, GG2. :)In short, we had a disastrous beginning, a very good response, a good progression, and now caution's been thrown to the winds.1. Apart from the numbers of deaths, which might have been double the recorded rate during the peak about a month ago, yes, the numbers seem borne out by people's experiences. A very very sharp initial rise - probably due to the fact that we missed the first cases - was met with a very serious set of measures. There was certainly no unbearable strain on even state hospitals, though Istanbul (the epicentre in Turkey) had to channel overflow to private hospitals. And the testing numbers are correct. ;) Regarding why the mortality rate might be relatively low (it's actually not that low; there are many countries who've done better), you will find lengthy discussions of this topic on this thread if you read back.BTW, the FT has a graph of excess mortality figures (i.e. deaths which occurred by were not classed as due to Covid-19) here: https://tinyurl.com/ybvtlzf3 .2.

On the subject of the overall response, here's a list of videos:a) An eerie one that Lanni (I think) first linked to showing the lockdown at the weekends: https://www.youtube.com/watch…b) How things were in the then-largest hospital in Istanbul (a new, larger one was opened soon after - it had been a-building for several years) just two days before the peak number of active cases, a CNN report: https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2020/04…c) The testing-and-tracking program that was implemented even before the virus was identified in Turkey, by the BBC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnzIhUen2kYd) And you'll find my comments on the first iteration of the tracking app here (it gets new features every once in a while): https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g293…Hope this is the sort of info you wanted.

Thanks for the update I have been following most if not all of your posts and was after more of a general boots on the ground feeling as no doubt like ourselves you can get overkill with figures and charts which can be perversely skewed to suit

We were all very worried at the start, then a few weeks later faced difficulties with ordering groceries online when you had to order for the week after, and then suddenly in the first week of May things started to improve rapidly, in every respect.A wit said that Turkey was trying to achieve ""class immunity"" rather than ""herd immunity"" and if you look at the upmarket residential neighbourhoods in Turkey on the app versus the red eyesore of poorer neghbourhoods, you'll see that's certainly the case. This has hit the poor disproportionately hard, both in infection rates and economically. And while with the lifting of most restrictions blue collar workers are going back to work, white collar workers will continue to work from home. Most companies I speak with have no intention of returning to their offices until July or even August.But wrt to boots on the ground. I'm just a few years shy of being *required* by the government to stay at home without going out at all, so I don't venture out often, and I won't until daily numbers decline to below 400 or so. So I'm probably the wrong person to ask... But from my window, it's still obvious that people (in Istanbul at least) are being reasonably careful; traffic remains light and not too many pedestrians around. But I live in a residential neighbourhood; friends who get about more than I do have told me that outdoor restaurants and cafes are apparently doing a brisk trade, for example."
Thanks for that GG and keep up the good work and remain safe
Thank you GG.

"10th June pm2.45m tests, 173K infected, 4.7K dead, 147K recovered, 21.5K currently illWhile the 7-day moving average of new positive cases is now 945 and therefore appears to be below the prevous figures I posted eight days ago, they have actually begun to rise, having declined in the interim to 874.There are reports of exceedingly stupid social gatherings, and I suspect the rapid normalisation has not helped. I do see most people correctly wearing masks but it is STILL not required outside in Istanbul.(However, comments from the Minister of Health suggest the epidemic continues to lose strength in large cities and is moving into smaller ones and towns.)I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for the next two weeks or so, but it is sad that our numbers are no longer declining.Edited: 2:52 am, June 11, 2020 "
"GG thanks for update! I am a bit nervous on the idea or process on starting the international flight and welcome international tourists to Turkey too soon. With the increase the average number of positive cases, it makes me even more worried. I wouldn't suggest my family to visit me in Turkey when the situation is uncertain, rather than to wait a bit longer. In my city Gaziantep, many people don't wear mask or wear mask wrongly. In my Hayar Eve Sığar Gaziantep map, the red eyesore spots are still everywhere."
"1,195 new cases today. Last surpassed 4 weeks ago. How embarrassing.Edited: 1:21 pm, June 12, 2020 "
Thanks GG and Lanni for this update.Not the best news unfortunately.
"1,459 today. This is getting depressing."
"Meanwhile, over 150,000 households chosen at random by Turkstat will be tested for antibodies (these are the blood tests to show if you've had the virus, not the swabs used to determine who is currently ill).Will give an idea of what percentage of the population has had this virus. (By the number of tests chosen, I'm guessing somewhere in the order of 4% is what is expected, though it may turn out to be higher (good for the quality of the sampling) or lower (bad).)Edited: 1:48 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"I realise the Turkish economy is not too good and they need to get the tourists back, but, I am wondering are they getting rid of the lockdown too soon?. These figures from Reuter are not good and it will worry holidaymakers.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…Edited: 4:51 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"Well, yes."
"Some observations rather than numbers (part the first):Numbers continue to rise, to just below 1,600 for each of the past two days. During the initial phase of the rise, the press was remarkably silent about the trend, but the dam seems to have burst yesterday, and the twitterverse is also flooded. (Anyone who wants to follow the news, should probably also go to Twitter, #koronavirüs.)A few measures have been taken to slow (but I fear, not stop) the rise, including making the wearing of masks mandatory everywhere in five more provinces, bringing the total to 42. To Adıyaman, Afyonkarahisar, Amasya, Ardahan, Aydın, Balıkesir, Bartın, Batman, Bolu, Burdur, Denizli, Düzce, Elazığ, Eskişehir, Gaziantep, Giresun, Iğdır, Isparta, Kahramanmaraş, Karabük, Kırklareli, Kocaeli, Konya, Kütahya, Malatya, Mardin, Muğla, Muş, Nevşehir, Osmaniye, Sakarya, Siirt, Sivas, Şırnak, Tunceli, Uşak, Zonguldak were added Diyarbakır, Erzurum, Kayseri, Rize ve Şanlıurfa).In addition, various places in the country have been put into quarantine. All very reminiscent of March.However, there now appears to be the germ of a willingness to re-impose measures, where necessary.The Minister of Health's announcements veer between the desperate and the Delphic. I am just about as likely as Croesus to divine their real meaning, but this is what I think is happening:In a number of places, the trend in the virus is as expected. That is to say, for example in Istanbul, more people are getting infected through casual contact. This is as expected, and not by itself cause for worry.In a number of other places, the ending of restrictions has led to people gathering for funerals, condolences, this party, that party, that really necessary get-together, etc. This is where the jump in cases is.Now, I've been doing some research, and looking at the studies published, the risk of catching this virus (even if no-one's wearing masks) in the street appears to be vanishingly low - expressed in the per-millions rather than percentages. If all evryone did was mill around outdoors, provided people didn't get intimately close or linger, the risk is negligible, and if this was all that was happening, we might expect to see a few tens of cases per day.Risks seem to jump about tenfold when similar activity happens indoors, for obvious reasons.Risks then start to rise geometrically, when instead of individuals encountering individuals (say, two people passing each other on the street or on a stairwell), people gather together in groups.However, based on these same probabilities I've been able to gather (themselves based on research that will do doubt change with time) if 30 people gather in an enclosed space for three hours, none of them wearing masks, and if at least one is ill (though asymptomatic), there's something like a 30% chance (at the moment, given the prevalence of the virus in Turkey, which I estimate at 1,500x14x5 [the daily number of cases multiplied by the incubation period multiplied by the ratio for asymptomatic carriers] or 105,000 people) that between 1 and 29 people in that grouping will also catch the virus.(BTW, while the studies of the risks of transmission will no doubt be improved, once you grind the numbers, they do make sense. Otherwise, we'd all have been infected.)And it is this sort of group contact that Turks almost see as a necessity."
"Observations (part the second, being a bit of a digression):This then of course begs the question: what on earth is point of social distancing (1, 1.5 or 2m, depending on your country) or masks outdoors? From my very rare forays into the outside world, I see markings delineating where you're supposed to stand - but the same distance is applicable both indoors and out. But there is big difference in the outdoor-versus-indoor risk. I calculate (and remember the provisos given above) that if the social distancing outdoors is 1m, then indoors it ought to be 2-4m, depending on how well ventilated the area is. The answer, therefore, is to discipline people. (It also does decrease the risk.)My previous research into how virsus spread and replicate showed the importance of what is called ""initial viral load"" - that is to say, the number of viruses that make it into your system for you to stand a good chance of falling ill. In no vrius known is this in single digits, and even in the case of the nasty eneterovirus (which are unusual) you need to get abut 40 in at one go. Basically, there's a world of difference between:a) Having someone obviously ill sneeze right into your face. 20,000 droplets, each carrying 1-10 viruses, and you're exposed to 100,000 of them. Say 10% of them manage to attach to your ACE receptors, and they've multiplied by 100 by the time your body gets round to noticing them. In this case, welcome to the joys of Covid-19.b) 10 viruses waft up your nose while walking down the street. Not only is the likelihood of any one of them being able to latch on low, but even some of them do by the time they've multiplied, the immune system oblitetates themwithout you even noticing. You wouldn't even be ""asymptomatic"". (The immune system is a marvellous thing, and it's not all about antibodies.)orc) 10-100 people talking animatedly in a closed room, for a number of hours. Even if one of them is infected (and asymptomatic at that) then that's an awful lot of virsus being breathed in.This is why you've all heard of choirs falling ill, for example. Taking loudly projects as many droplets as sneezing (though not as far), and if prjecting your voice, well, that difference is cut too.You may ask: but will only 10 viruses waft up my nose walking down the street? I'd say that looks like a pretty high number. Let's take an estimate at the high end of things and assume we breathe 15m3 of air a day (yep, that's all it is). And 8 billion people will breathe 120 billion m3 of air a day. But 120 billion m3 is equal to 120 km3, and the earth's atmosphere (the first two thousand metres or so, where it's comfortable for all) is about 2 billion km3. That's like trying to taste 0.06 micrograms (not milli) of salt in a litre of water.Given a little wind - well, today's a still day in Istanbul and the wind speed is currently 9km/h, but even that means that in the space of a minute, what you've breathed out has dispersed 2.5 metres in a second and 150m in a minute (and since it's dispersed in volume, the diffusion is cubed).This is not advice to stop wearing masks outdoors - they do help - but to calm your fears if you should encounter people who aren't. I've spent the past couple of days trying to fit probabilities to the spread of the virus - and assignment from my mother, who's trying to fit as many essential things into a few days as possible ahead of what she fears will be the second wave - and these numbers do seem to make sense. Otherwise, as I said, we'd all have fallen ill.And masks can indeed help. While the likelihood of those 10 viruses which have wafted down your nose making you ill is pretty much non-existent, some unfortunate bugger will be. And since we're talking populations of millions in the cities, it will happen."
"Observations (part the third, back on track):If we assume that masks are to remind people of the existence of this virus and to impose some discipline on them, the devil-may-care (or Allah-will-provide) attitude of many people will work against this. And the numbers we're seeing today, through incidents that are reported in the press, localised outbreaks in Bursa and Adana and Konya are the result. And in por Ardahan, where they had no cases for two weeks, they now have 18 cases....To sum up.There is an extremely short window here to prevent localised outbreaks from turning into a nationwide phenomenon.There is a relatively dearth of *quality* information on what localised measures may have already been taken. And the fact that people started to be fined - the rather odd sum of 392 liras - for ignoring mask rules may also perhaps drive home the message. If those measures are strict enough, then the fact that testing and tracking capabilities are each an order of magniitude better than in March gives me some hope, though I wouldn't expect numbers to decline immediately.But there is a great deal of uncertainty. And we may have to go back into lockdown."
"In other news, since 22nd March, a total of 145,000-odd people have been fined (and 698 arrested) for breaking social distancing.Of this number, fully 32,000 have been in Gaziantep.Istanbul follows with 16,200, but then it has seven-and-a-half times as many people.Van is third with 5,300 (and it is high considering its population, though still better than Gaziantep)Kocaeli is best, apparently. 19."
"Thanks for the interesting read GG and jokingly and if it was safe some may say ""you need to get out more!! ""If I could garner your opinion do you believe that the rise in the areas you mention or in particular along the borders areas where there is a high % of refugee camps with no doubt difficult conditions and little or no social distancing play a part in the rise of the infection rate within this region. It would be interesting to hear how this is being managed within these camps without the promised funding from the EU when these camps were first set up. Secondly we know how Turkish people can be friendly by nature and additionally some religiously in how they meet and greet family and friends and the social economic dynamics with large extended family members living together all have a factor going forward with the figures now being seen.Going forward and if the borders were to open I have real concerns and if we look at the holiday resorts to begin with, and looking at events here in the UK it can only be a matter of time before the infection rate rises. Russia from the anecdotal evidence appear to be suppressing information and if true their infection rate could be one of the worst in the world.Istanbul is obviously not only a tourist trap but also a central hub for people visiting and transiting from a number of Middle Eastern countries.Though figures from such can be difficult to validate, Libya appears to be particularly having a very high number of deaths/infections and due to location and past issues there I would imagine there is a high number of transient Libyan nationals who would travel between both countries to visit family and for business"
"Quoted from GG ""Of this number, fully 32,000 have been in Gaziantep."" Well, it is not strange at all and ah well … that is the reality of my lovely gastronomy city"
"@Lanni: I haven't spent more than a week in total in Gaziantep over the years, and I remember the first time (oh, about 30 years ago) being pleasantly surprised, but what is it with these numbers? :)...17th June2.77m tests, 183K infected, 4.9K dead, 155K recovered, 23.2K currently illWith the recent spike in cases, the number of active cases - those currently ill - has also begun to edge up.The seven-day moving average of new cases is now 1,384. :(...In other news, finally, finally, mask-wearing in all public spaces has been made mandatory in Istanbul too (and Ankara and Bursa). I expect the government's depleted finances will get a nice windfall from fines..."
"@GG and all, visit us in Antep whenever possible (maybe when we are back to ""old"" normal? If possible?). Gastronomy city and many people came to Antep to have culinary a-day holiday starting from morning to late evening exploring all the famous restaurant - food - cafe, and getting some calories extra at the end of short trip :)) I start to sound like promoting Gaziantep's tourism. The number 32.000 well, it is not surprising valla GGMany times I had to run back home once I found my park close to my flat was really full, I mean full of people, without mask, without social distancing (often more than 50 people in a group), Few of them didn't believe in coronavirus. And sadly I also found the masks being thrown everywhere to dirty the park. Hope people in Antep will change the attitude the sooner. If one day Bakan Koca said penalty will be applied to them who doesn't use mask in Antep, I will agree!"
"@Lanni, I may well get round to Gaziantep again - but first I need to get back to the UK! I came around the beginning of March - it feels like a decade ago! - intending to stay for a few weeks, and while I cleaned out my fridge, I hate to think what I forgot and what has multiplied since. :)...In other news, we have some more details about the state of affairs in various cities. Moderate good news (if you're in Istanbul), Oh, no! (if you're anywhere else). (I wish they would make this a regular occurrence.)(Remember that the 30-day average of new cases in Turkey is 1,071, and the 7-day average is 1,384.)In Istanbul, the respective figures are 653 (or 61% of the total figure for Turkey) and 620 (45%), though there has been a recent uptick there tooIn Ankara, the 30-day average is only 127, but the seven-day is now up sharply to 155.İzmir: from 32 back up to 38Bursa: 64 v. 84Konya: 41 v. 73 (!)Diyarbakır: 58 v. 87No figures for Gaziantep, I'm afraid, but the Minister did include it in a list of cities with a sharp uptick recently: Diyarbakır, Ankara, Tokat, Afyon, Konya, Gebze, Bursa, Samsun, Van, Gaziantep, & Şanlıurfa. (I don't think that's in any particular order).....Other points from the press conferenceThe average age of the people falling ill with Covid-19 is declining.Perhaps related to this, while roughly half of hospitalised patients developed pneumonia in March, the current ratio is just below 10%.Also perhaps related to this, the average length of stay in ICU is now 2.7 days versus 18.4.Of all the people who have died, 72% were over the age of 60 AND had a pre-existing condition. The highest ratio of local deaths to local infections was in Gümüşhane (13.3% - remind me never to fall ill there) and the lowest was in Kilis (!) (0.33%).Edited: 5:20 am, June 18, 2020 "
"Just as the recent spike in new cases was stabilising, the high school exams today (and next week, and for universities) will no doubt lead to another bump. The sole saving grace (and a weak one at that) is that evidence suggests young people are not only slightly less likely to get infected, but they're also slightly less likely to pass it on to others.Many many such crowds today: https://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/Archive/2020/6…Though at least the tests were administered with due regard for proper spacing. https://im.haberturk.com/2020/06/20/ver15926…Edited: 6:18 am, June 20, 2020 "
"Not wishing to doubt your claim, however can you point to evidence that young people are less likely to pass it on.Young people I believe are more likely to be fit and healthy and as such be asymptomatic or have a mild reaction so are less likely to be tested or put them self forward for testing"

"It's somewhere in the studies I've read over the past three months, few of which I've bookmarked or downloaded. I'll start trawling and if I find it I'll post here and also PM you. But I have other plans for the next two days, so it won't be immediate (and that's assuming I manage to find it).However, if I may digress a little, what we mean by ""immunity"" in disease is actually a little different to the meaning of the word in other contexts. My dictionary gives it as ""the ability of an organism to *resist* infection"". In our favourite American TV crime shows, immunity from prosecution is granted to some people who co-operate; it essentially means the state attorneys won't or can't prosecute. Immunity in disease is more akin to them starting the legal process, but then whole thing coming to a screeching halt.""Immunity"" comes in two different forms: short-term (which means you won't normally fall ill with the same flu a month or two after you've had it because the antibodies are still present in high numbers in your blood) and long-term (eg the measles shot that I got as a child should still trigger a response from the so-called ""memory"" cells to kick-start antibody production, and help prevent me falling ill, though the response will be weaker because decades have passed, but these will certainly supplement the by-now increasingly lonely antibodies still floating about).In an illness like Covid-19, where the strength of the immune system is directly (and inversely) correlated with how likely you are to suffer a serious illness (with age and things like diabetes weakening the system), you would expect a larger proportion of the young population to have an asymptomatic response unless they're exposed to high initial doses of the virus. The serological studies on this are being conducted in many countries, and we'll no doubt learn the results in a month or so.We also know (and this I can find more easily, because it's relatively recent, but still not this weekend) that asymptomatic people are roughly 6x less likely to pass this disease on to someone else. This is because the viral load they shed is much lower than those who are ill.So you would expect transmission rates to be lowest amongst babies and infants, still low in youngsters and get worse as people get older (indeed, elderly people have been noted to be infectious even after the illness should be over - another study, this time from months ago, but I don't think it's been superseded, )I'll find all these and post / PM them next week. As you noted in a previous post, I really need to get out more. :D Or at least pursue other interests!(PS: And as you may know, children and youths have been locked up for most of the past four months, so they'll only be infectious if they've recently caught it. The number of carriers should still be lower than in the general population.)Edited: 7:44 am, June 20, 2020 "

"As per the Minister of Health's announcements:With 118K of the roughly 153K *random* blood tests (and non-random swab tests, just to be on the safe side) having been analysed, the percentage of the Turkish population carrying antibodies to the virus has been announced (the number may change a little depending on the remaining tests) as... 0.81%.Which is pretty much you would expect - if 192K people have so far tested (been swabbed) positive for the virus, 664K having been infected (most of them asymptomatic) is well within the ballpark.In the Minister's words ""we'd have to endure an epidemic 60-70x worse than the one we've been through in order to achieve herd immunity""....And the average age of new infections is now 32. :o"

vipfamily has the most recent news about testing facilities for people entering the country here: https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g293…and the Grauniad has a report on how some countries are faring here: https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interac… though I think they're a little optimistic regarding Turkey.

"Nail on the head there GG, street raves/party's, multiple violent events, just wait for the pubs to open next week, carnage"
Where is that picture from GG? Looks like Bodrum.
"Yes, I believe you're right. And the one on the left, Bournemouth?"
"Oh, I see. Plenty of other crowded places in Turkey though, aren't there? Transmission isn't predicted to be high outdoors, if I'm not wrong. I am also in the UK now and finding it very empty, and much easier to social distance than it was back in Istanbul. Sad to see the scenes from the beaches yesterday but I think the hysteria is unnecessary and uncalled for."
"I appreciate your post GG it’s very well expressed and so true. I have just been watching the news here in UK... and for the first time in 10 days cases are rising. This is worrying, we haven’t even got a proper test and trace yet, even though it’s in the pipeline it’s too late coming, and the easing of the lockdown is i m o too soon, scientists aren’t at all optimistic. l really don’t think we will be welcome in Turkey or anywhere else until things starts to look better in the U.K."
"Nah, I think the UK'll be (relatively) fine from this point on. Yes, the T&T is way behind, but you've got more sense than to spend hours indoors gossipping.So, please, by all means come to Turkey. And while you've about it, I have a cousin who has a carpet shop, which rather resembles a cave, not at all ventilated. He absolutely insists that we drink tea with him, together with a few tourists from the US or India, of course The more the merrier! :o While the shop assistants heave one carpet after another onto the floor to display their beauty. Drink your hygienically prepared tea and inhale the sweet, sweet smell of carpet. Have you not heard? Micro-lint is an effective barrier to Covid-19!(The whole thing is facetious, of course, but the last point is perhaps not too far off the mark: https:/…acs.nanolett.0c02278 )Stay safe, and keep well, all. I'm off to do whats become socially quite reasonable to say these days: I like drinking alone. :o"
Haha l think we have all been doing that GG... enjoy it!
"The total number of cases in Turkey - 195,833 - has just surpassed Germany's, and daily new cases are running at roughly 3x the Germant level. I imagine we'll surpass France pretty soon too, but beyond that the number of cases is either too high to surpass any time soon, or the countries are in the throes of a very serious rise in cases. However, if the current daily difference in cases continues, we should edge ahead of Italy in early August, Spain in late August and the UK in December.However, I am rather concerned with the latest messages from the Minister of Health. Normally quite reasonable, for the past two days he's sounded like an excessively optimistic politician."
Thanks for the update and all your input of other posts which have not only been informative but also educational.My opinion is that most governments are now struggling how to loosen the grips of their own individual lockdowns and balancing economy over health of the public.I believe it would be best that at each stage of loosening there was to be a period of reflection to asses the effects of such easing and the opening of borders here in the UK and from my understanding of Turkeys intentions is being rushed through for purely economic reasons.
"Always thanks for your posts on this topic GG. For me your reviews on latest figures are equivalent to Dr. John Campbell in YouTube channel. Thanks GG! After travelling within Turkey and let's hope tomorrow we hear good news about air bridges / travel corridor: I have similar comments like GG's - please come to Turkey. As long as you know the safe and healthy places to visit, accommodations, travel / transportation means, restaurants, the trip will be super enjoyable. In addition to covid19 test in some airports and covid19 insurance available (by 1st July if I am not mistaken), somehow Turkey is ready to welcome international visitors. I may sound like promoting Turkey's tourism but well, time is very tough for travel industry now, so … visit Turkey :-)"
"I hope people from other forums take the time you read your latest post on this GG. It has definitely put me off making any travel plans while this virus is still lurking around. It’s not looking that positive from where I’m standing and agree with Grumpy Grandad here, health is paramount to anything else."
"""equivalent to Dr. John Campbell"" High praise indeed, of which I am undeserving, since I have nowehere near his grasp of things. But thank you for the sentiment. I'll happily bask in the praise.:)...Remember ""flatten the curve""? Well, it seems the Turks took that to heart. The curve has indeed been flattened and everyone's doing their damndest to keep it that way (until, almost inevitably, it isn't). Little or no pressure on hospitals, everything chugging along much better, the economy improving rapidly. The problem is that most countries sensibly want to flatten the curve even even further.This will go on for a while, until, perhaps, the authorities realise that no amount of repeating ""we've overcome the problem"" to the EU will make a blind bit of difference and they'll keep us on their blacklist. There goes any hope of any real revival in tourism. And the authorities will complain about unfair treatment (though the EU is being rather naughty: it won't allow people in willy-nilly unless infection rates are below EU levels, but then also won't allow in the Chinese unless they allow in EU citizens)."
"With you all the way on your views ,but dragging the EU into the mix of it all is just another layer of bureaucracy that's needed like a hole in the head.Turkey definitely dodged a bullet there a few years ago"

"Once again GG thanks for the update, its like a Government briefing without the spin!!!I read your comments with interest and note your comments re economy and tourism not being a main driver in Turkey a point that some people fail to see or notice when visiting.If I could raise a question that may be a moot point, but when visiting last year I spoke to an acquaintance of ours who we have built up a good relationship with and got around to discussing the implications of the year round climate, in particular the Fethiye region.Due to the very hot and humid summers and damp cold winters and with such huge differing temperatures between the seasons that a lot of locals suffer with Asthma and other respiratory conditions.I would imagine with the obvious effects of Covid the general figures in Turkey and the anticipated influx of foreign visitors that if the current trends remain that Autumn/winter could be a difficult period"
"""like a Government briefing without the spin!"" I have found my calling! :))As for your question: most interesting. I hadn't even thought about that.Let me start by saying that Turkish common wisdom is that only the coasts are damp, and there only the eastern Black Sea on the one hand, and south of Kuşadası through to the Syrian border on the other. In Istanbul, for example, year-round humidity isn't really an issue unless you have a yalı on the water, in which case you better install demuhidifiers. (And central heating changes things too - I have two large humidifiers in my Istanbul flat though I live 400m from the sea.) And the rest of Turkey, alas, is relatively arid.As per the Turkish Meteorological Office, these are current humidity levels in the 10 most populous cities, as of right now at near noon on the 2nd First, the three biggest:Istanbul c.50%Ankara c.35%Izmir c.45%Then, the other seven:Adana: c.55%Antalya: c.20% (forecast to rise to 75% in the evening)Bursa c.55%Gaziantep:c.20%Kayseri: c.40%Konya: c.35%Mersin: c.70%So, on the whole, reasonable and agrees with the common wisdom. (It's generally a combination of 1) proximity to the sea 2) large bodies of still or flowing water and 3) mountain ranges inland that create highly humid conditions, and all three are generally only present along the coast.) Turkey's certainly no Florida. It's the mountains that make the difference, really.As for asthmatics, I found this article from our leading socialist newspaper from last year which quotes the Turkey Thorax Association head as saying that the number of asthmatics in Turkey is appx 3.5m or about 4-5% of the population. https:/… That's a relatively low number.Autumn and winter may very well present problems, but I imagine it'll be due to cotninued rampant socialising rather than asthma. :) And air pollution too will be an important factor: https://waqi.info/#/c/36.621/33.07/5.8z (though I've found that the extreme numbers that sometimes pop up in that map often disappear quickly, so check every few hours) and as you will see Turkey generally has higher air pollution than European countries."
"The Ministry of Health has issued a Covid-19 summary, which you can read in English here: https:/… .My main take-away from that is the fact that on the one hand, death rates per age group in Turkey don't seem all that different from other countries. (See https:/…case-fatality-rate-of-covid-19-by-age to compare, though that data might be a little old.)The other is that the Turks seem to be hospitalising a rather high proportion of the cases - more than half - and this may perhaps have helped.I think these also answer the question of why death rates in Turkey overall are relatively low: most people who were infected seem to have been relatively young, and they have been getting decent care.Edited: 3:57 pm, July 02, 2020 "

great stats GrandGourmand. I found them very interesting. Thanks for sharing
"A pleasure, canmom. You know me - there's never a number I read that I didn't like and feel like reporting. :)...In other news:As you all know, this page https://covid19.saglik.gov.tr/ is the main source of information for us on how the disease is progressing in Turkey.As of Sunday, they also began to issue daily, more detailed reports, but with a day's delay. (It looks as though they started a week ago, but they didn't). Those reports can be found on this page: https:/…covid-19-situation-report-turkey.htmlThere are small discrepancies, mainly to do with timing. For example, hitherto the official coronavirus count has been the difference between the previous data handed to the Minister of Health aand the most recent data. As this happens at the time of the daily briefing (around 8 pm-ish) every day (with the exception of two instances, IIRC), the official ""coronavirus day"" in Turkey has been slightly irregular, something between twenty-three-and-a-half hours and twenty-four-and-a-half.The new data is different. It just gives the numbers for each calendar day. Hence the slight differences.However, at least for now, the official data looks as though it'll remain the data announced by the Minister of Health in his evening homilies.But one area where the new data is superior is that it gives a regular geographical breakdown of cases for the first time. And the longer monthly situation reports go into even greater detail including, for example, mortality rates by age group.I shall continue to use the 8 pm-ish data for general commentary but the calendar-day data for regional.Double-posted for greater visibility."
"DATA AS OF 7TH JULY, DAILY BRIEFING:3.73m tests, 208K infected, 5.3K dead, 175K recovered, 17.3K currently illThis was a good week. On the one hand, daily new cases declined, and with the hump around 25th June now out of the calculations, the seven-day moving average is now down to 1,142. And the roughly 17 thousand people still ill is the lowest figure for active cases since 2nd April.Given information made available, together with the new geographical data mentioned in the post immediately above, we can make a few more tentative observations....DATA AS OF 23:59, 6TH JULY, SITUATION REPORT(Using 7-day averages throughout, as numbers jump up and down.)Compared with its position in April and May, Istanbul has made huge strides. At one point, the ratio of people infected every day to its population was 330%+ above the average for the rest of the country. As of 6th Juy, this is down to a mere 34%. :) The new epicentre of the outbreak is the south-eastern region - comprising Gaziantep, Urfa, Diyarbakir, Mardin and five other provinces. Not only is the moving average of new cases in that region now slightly higher than in Istanbul (312 versus 299) but since its population in aggregate is only about 54% of Istanbul's, the per-capita incidence of new cases is now far higher. Simply put, this region could be in a second wave (but we don't know, because regional data only extends as far back as 30th June).The ""Western Central Anatolian"" region (Ankara, Konya and Karaman) is a close second for where things are going wrong. The per-capita incidence of new cases is now a smidgen above Istanbul's.The main tourist regions of the Aegean and the Mediterranean are relatively OK, with per-capita incidences of new cases 48% and 61% below the Turkish average, though the best performing region is the Eastern Black Sea (Trabzon, Rize etc), which is 71% below the national average. The main industrial area - the ""Eastern Marmara"" region - is at roughly the national average....One thing we have heard less of in the past week are those instances of multiple new infections resulting from useless, stupid parties and get-togethers. However, they've not stopped completely. But as vipfamily highlighted in this amusing post https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g293… perhaps people are being a little more cautious.This has come at roughly the same time as a slew of micro-regulations covering gatherings, but given that the police don't seem to be able to ensure even 90% compliance with mask-wearing in the street in the middle of Istanbul, I'm not sure they're going to have a major impact....The fact that it's been a good week - the seven-day average is currently only 31% above the low point seen on 7th June - doesnt't mean much. We all know numbers can easily shoot up 20% in a day.Only after several weeks of overall improving numbers should we begin to start to contemplate that maybe the new normal is a process that is manageable.However, in the meantime, the residents of Istanbul can take half a vicory lap, while those of the south-east really ought to hang out STAY AT HOME banners. :)"
"GrandGourmand, but what are the latest hospitalisation and death figures? They're what really counts to see the trajectory of the epidemic because cases can be an artifact of testing."
"""They're what really counts to see the trajectory of the epidemic"" I wouldn't be so categorical, but OK, if you're interested in one country, but definitely not if you're interested in comparing two or more. The thing is, different countries hospitalise at different severity levels. So, for example, of the 206,827 recorded cases through to 5th July, 110,338 were hospitalised. In most cases, this was on the basis of a simple cough or fever. The aim here, since the beginning, has been to hospitalise all but the mildest or the asymptomatic cases.For comparison purposes: for the past week or so the UK records say around 500-600 cases a day, and hospitalises 100; we record double that rate and hospitalise 700.The aggregate and recent data for the hospitalisation rate was (and remains) very high. There is no ex ante reason to assume Turks are experiening this disease more severely. Nor, following the serological studies, is this a ""tip of the iceberg"" situation.""cases can be an artifact of testing"" Only at peak pandemic. Once the positive test rate (number of new cases / tests done) comes below 3-4%, then there remain very few additional cases that can be squeezed out, especially if you've got tracking up and running. And since the Turks aim at sub-3% levels, then the numbers won't be an artefact of testing volumes. At the other extreme - at 8+ levels, you're probably missing out on a lot of new cases, but only countries with inadequate systems in place like the US are at that level currently.As for the latest hospitalisation figures, I simply don't follow them. But they are available, with one day's delay at: https:/…covid-19-situation-report-turkey.htmlEdited: 5:46 am, July 08, 2020 "
GG thanks for the updates and your continued efforts to pass on detailed credible information. I wonder if the area in the S. East which have seen the largest increase could be due to the places mentioned being staging posts for people visiting refugee camps on the border areas where social distancing and infection control would be limited to say the least.
"Erratum: ""In most cases"" - no. Corrected: ""In about a third of cases""."
"GG - I wouldn't think so. The total number of people who're living in those camps is now probably down to sub-80,000 levels, as social housing has been built across the country to accommodate them. And for the remaining few, they're very easy to administer. See: https://www.unhcr.org/tr/wp-content/uploads/… .Edited: 6:02 am, July 08, 2020 "
"... what would be interesting, of course, is if we could see a breakdown of cases by citizens, residents and refugees. However, any publication of data on this subject is likely to provoke a storm.If it so happens that, say, Syrian refugees are falling ill or dying at appreciable greater rates than Turks or normal residents, then the NY Times or a similar rag will no doubt carry a headline: ""Turkey uses Covid-19 to kill refugees"".If, in the other (for me equally likely) scenario of infection or death rates being lower, then Turks will be up in arms.It's a no-win situation for any government. :)"
Once again thanks and spoken like a true diplomat or attaché and identifies the difficulties of Governing which at times we could all do with having a little more undertraining of being in an impossible place at times
"No, thank *you* for all the praise.But, you know what I'd really like to see? Data on transmission in trains and buses. With the contact tracing, HES codes and all that, the Turkish government must have a good idea by now.All that I vaguely remember is two (Chinese, IIRC) studies - and I know I haven't even answered your first request - one of which showed a fairly random distribution of infections on a plane, and another showing something similar on a bus. But without contact tracing in place, we could not know then whether those infections were caused on the plane or bus, or elsewhere. Nor can we be 100% sure even now, but we could get much closer to the truth.But those studies, if they ever come out, will be months or even years from now, I suppose."
"Apologies for being late with this week's figures. My internet connection is being temperamental....DATA AS OF 15TH JULY, DAILY BRIEFING:4.11m tests, 216K infected, 5.4K dead, 198K recovered, 12.8K currently illThis was a the second good week in a row. Daily new cases declined gently, and the seven-day moving average is now down to 1,000. And the roughly 13 thousand people still ill is the lowest figure for active cases since March....DATA AS OF 23:59, 14TH JULY, SITUATION REPORT(Using 7-day averages throughout, as numbers jump up and down. ""Daily number"" refers to the 7-day average.)Compared to the situation on 6th July, eight out of the twelve NUTS-1 regions recorded declines, one was stable (the Mediterranean) and three were up (E. Black Sea, W. Black Sea, and C. Anatolia - the last two sharply).It is good to see that the S. E. Anatolia region (Gaziantep, Urfa, Mardin, etc) has been one of those with declining cases, and the daily number there is now 252. However, at 2.84 new cases per 100,000, it is still the region with the highest prevalence.W. Anatolia (Ankara, Konya, Karaman) and Istanbul, the two other regions with the highest prevalence, also managed to record declines, quite substantial in the case of W. Anatolia. (W.A. now at 1.72 per 100,000, Istanbul 1.70). The Southeast, Western Anatolia and Istanbul drag the Turkish average up; everywhere else is below the national daily rate for new cases of 1.21 cases per 100,000.The best place not to have to catch Covid-19 is now the W. Marmara region (Edirne, Çanakkale, Balıkesir, etc) where new infections are running at 7 a day, and the rate is 0.22.The Aegean region (İzmir, Denizli, etc) has also seen improvement (now 0.59 new cases per 100,000), while the Mediterranean region is essentially flat at 0.54.The C. Anatolian region (Sivas, Kayseri, the eastern part of Cappadocia for anyone who's interested) has seen a very sharp rise, from 28 cases per day to 40. (0.65 per 100,000 to 0.87). I have no idea about the reason, I'm afraid. Neither do I have any reason to give for the rise in the W. Black Sea region (from 26 cases/day to 33, a rise in the daily infection rate from 0.56 to 0.72). Both those regions seem to be in upward trend. As for the E. Black Sea region, while there has been a rise in cases from 11 to 12, and the rate has risen from 0.41 to 0.45, this does not seem to be a trend....Weddings have been identified by the Minister of Health as the most common cause of new cases, though there are also new infections in industry. Surprisingly, the larger factories haven't reported any significant numbers (yet?)....The aggregate and regional numbers, while decent, are not brilliant.Though the daily test numbers are fair, they're not at the sort of level that you need to see for us to be able to breathe a sigh of relief. The positivity rate is around 2%; Germany's is 0.6%. This suggests that while Turkey is doing more than enough to contain the spread of the virus, it's not doing enough to get numbers down fast. At the moment, we're testing anyone who wants to be tested as well as anyone who's been tracked-and-traced) but we need to test people even if they don't feel the need....We await news of whether any region will be placed in lockdown over the next Bayram (31st July - 3rd August, with a half day on the 30th).Edited: 1:07 am, July 16, 2020 "

"My feeling (rather than any analysis of even the simplest sort) is that each region and each city within that region, indeed even the towns and, in rural areas, villages needs to experience a spike before taking things seriously. And that these spikes will re-occur as people can't be vigilant day after day after day.For example, things are going reasonably well in Istanbul, perhaps because of the severity of cases back when, but I'm willing to bet we'll see another spike....However, take heart.The NY Times has a very useful page on the range of vaccines being developed (registration may be necessary, payment is not): https:/…coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html"

"Really excellent work, Grand Gourmand. We have much to thank you for."
Thank you Robert. How're things in Selçuk? The Hayat Eve Sığar map showing any cause for concern?
"I had promised to deliver a comparison of the state of affairs in Turkey with other countries. But which countries? I decided to select all those Tripadvisor domains that led to this site (this is not just tripadvisor.com or tripadvisor.co.uk, but also tripadvisor.com.au, co.za, com.sg and others too). To which I added Germany, Iran and Russia because of the importance of tourism from those countries.The data is from Our World in Data https://ourworldindata.org/ . One slight issue: because of time zone differences, different 24-hr periods are being compared. However, as I'm again using 7-day moving averages, the discrepancy should be minimal. Also note that these are country-wide data and there may well be wide regional variations within individual countries.The following graphs show the ratio of cases in the various countries, relative to Turkey. So, Germany, for example, is seeing new cases at (recently) roughly half the rate of Turkey, while Iran is running at roughly two-and-a-half times the rate.Secondly, I have attempted to show the positive test rate on the same graph without using a second axis. While not exact (variations are too large), the thicker the line, the better the positive test rate relative to Turkey. (I do not use tests per million or whatever; comparing NZ, Turkish and US testing rates in such a fashion would be ridiculous as the underlying prevalence is so massively different.) I would suggest the test positivity ratio shows roughly how good (or at least intense) your testing is. The WHO recommended standard is 5.0% over two weeks. The current Turkish rate is 2.0%. All countries in the graphs have met that 5.0% standard throughout the period displayed, with the exception of India, Iran and South Africa; Singapore has begun to meet that standard recently while the US barely met the standard before rising above that rate. Tracing systems will also impact the efficacy of testing; all countries in this list are adjudged to have a more-or-less satisfactory system in place, with the exception of the US, where tracing is currently limited.The better performers. (NB: New Zealand's lne should be even thicker, but I had to cut off somewhere!) Not too surprisingly, all have considerably more intense testing regimes in place than Turkey (but, Australia, what's going on?)https://imgur.com/48bwsQpThe *very*-roughly-the-same performers. Canada has the best testing intensity of this sample, Iran the worst.https://imgur.com/S5hw8UYThe worse peformers. Russia has the best testing here, roughly the same as Turkey, South Africa the worst.https://imgur.com/E2dm4wFIf you have any questions, I'd be happy to try to answer them. I hope I didn't put too many cats among the pigeons."
"As there is commentary on the forums about the state of affairs in Spain, I thought I'd add that to the mix too.The case of Spain is a cautionary tale we would do well not to ignore in Turkey. It is a country where everything seemed to be handled and going well - better than in Turkey - but where things abruptly changed for the worse. (The data goes up to 24th July for cases and Turkish testing; Spain's testing data is unavailable on Our World in Data after the 17th.)Comparison of cases:https://imgur.com/U79nfOvComparison of test positivity:https://imgur.com/76kuqo6"
"What worries me is FRT T.V. Putting on F.B. So may pictures of meetings of people all standing together with no social distancing and many not wearing masks. Also., reports of people in the resorts of Hisaronu and Oldueniz of visitors not wearing masks from T.A. A local Calis restaurant and Hotel owner putting on images of her staff on F.B. cleaning the restaurant all with mask on, including her. Then she puts on a video of her and her husband at a wedding, no masks and not a mask in sight of any of the guests and all up dancing together with no social distancing. Once this lady realised what she had done, she deleted her F.B. Post, however the worry would be still there, as she could have taking the virus back to her restaurant and Hotel from the Wedding.It seems a lot of people in Turkey are in denial. This is a concern for me.Edited: 2:02 pm, July 26, 2020 "
"Weddings are indeed the prime cause of new cases in Turkey, week in, week out. She may have taken down the video because that is, of course, illegal, not that it seems to matter much to people.As I've expressed before, it is my belief that we need flare-ups in every city, town and hamlet before people realise the seriousness of this thing."
"I agree, It seems this lady did not realise what she was doing, there where so many comments on her F.B from the U.K. including OMG. She is now back to showing her restaurant with all the staff and her wearing masks. I have spoken to a friend in Fethiye who attended a very large wedding in the area and they said no one was wearing masks and everyone was up dancing without social distancing. In the U.K. you are only allowed 30 people at at Wedding including venue staff and photographer. It seems in Turkey with all the Covid-19 rules and regulations there are no rules for weddings."
"Oh, there are regulations - pages and pages of the stuff, specifically for weddings. There just aren't enough policemen.But what gets me is that by now anyone who knows how to read and write will know that weddings (or any party with a lot of participants) is prime territory for spreading this virus. Why do people still go to them?Edited: 4:13 pm, July 26, 2020 "

In April it had been -15% and in May -17% (though that was exaggerated by Bayram falling in May this year as opposed to June in 2019). Similarly, it is a considerable improvement over June's -2% (given the holiday effect reversing that month).So, Turkish manufacturing is humming. But tourism is dead."

Hi GG can you give us a perspective of the mediterranean region. Also you mention there s not enough police to warn people of wearing masks. Local jandarma dont even bat an eye when people are walking in and out if shops without masks. Shop owners not wearing masks. No one s giving out tickets or warning. Just wear the mask to protect those around you
"Honest to God, I'm not a bureaucrat sitting in Ankara with access to how police and soldiers are deployed throughout Turkey. :) And let's not forget that there are other things they're still responsible for, with those brought upon by this epidemic on top. But I'm sure you're right and there are ones who're oblivious.Other than knowing that masks outdoors aren't necessary in Antalya, I don't have much in the way of specific information, and no idea which shopowners are not following the rules. Here in Istanbul, while the rules about wearing masks are often breached outdoors, some corner shops don't seem to care; most do follow the rules and a few others don't even permit you to enter, masked or not (they bring the goods to the door), and supermarkets and larger stores are at full compliance.No doubt that's a contributing factor to the difference in trend between the two regions.PS What I mean by almost ""rising"" is that the week-on-week increase in the Mediterranean region was less than 2.5%. +/- 2.5% is the arbitrary limit I set for ""stable"", and the Med region was up 2.2%.Edited: 7:23 am, July 30, 2020 "
"Numbers now trending up...The usual haunts - Bodrum, Çeşme, etc - filled to overflowing with people away on Bayram break."
It doesn't look that good though looking at the numbers announced by Fahrettin Koca Bey yesterday. We are almost going back to 1000 new cases as of 1 August ....
"Numbers continue to trend up....The latest weekly (a bit out of date) situation report gives Mardin, Erzurum, Şanlıurfa, and Gaziantep as the cities with the biggest outbreaks....Meanwhile: https:/…newsOne wonders whether their ears ever get tired."
"The Ankara chamber of the Turkish Medical Association has issued a most remarkable and devastating critique of the way this virus has recently started to be handled: https:/…0007102001596525989.pdf (in Turkish). While this applies to Ankara alone, and IMNHO the Turkish Medical Association can be asses (eg their official recommendation was until last week that masks are unnecessary if you're healthy!) it's still worth reading the full report if you're able.A rough translation of the final paragraph:""The reopening decision was taken early due to economic concerns. Epidemiological data was disregarded. Health workers were not consulted. 80% of the participants [in the survey] stated that the decision to re-open was taken too early. While the epidemic continues at full speed in Ankara, 20% of healthcare professionals work more than 45 hours a week. 2/3 of the participants have not been tested during the pandemic period. 4% of respondents reported that they were infected after reopening. Half of the participants stated that there was at least one infected healthcare professional in the healthcare institution where they worked. The rate of those who stated that there was a relaxation in the measures taken in health institutions with the early reopening is 78%. 2/3 of the participants stated that there is an increase in the number of patients diagnosed with covid-19 in the health institutions where they work. 8 months after the first incident in China, 4 months after the official first case determination in our country, the problem of personal protective equipment is still not resolved. 1/3 of the participants reported that they suffered from a lack of PPE. Track-and-trace studies are almost abandoned. Due to the coding applied in our country, PCR test application, which is necessary for the diagnosis of the disease, is extremely limited. ... 45% of the participants stated that there was not enough time between two patients and that they had to disagnose patients with an interval of 5-10 minutes. 2/3 of the participants stated that that adequate precautions were not taken in emergency departments and during surgical intervention. 80% of the participants emphasized that the risk of transmission increased in the institutions where they work. Half of the healthcare workers surveyed stated that their working conditions have worsened. 1/3 reported that they experienced fatigue and burnout, 1/5 that they were better prepared for the second wave and 30% of them experienced a serious decline in motivation.""Reading through the report, you get more than just a feeling that from mid-June onwards the number of cases is far higher than reported."
"GG, I shared the article to my Turkish colleagues (to help me translating this academic article) and they had their (shocking) comments. Thanks a lot!Reading and checking twitter account of coronavirus turkey, I am almost having my less-doubt that by mid of August, when I hit my road travelling around Turkey again, the new cases may increase again, at least above 1000. Hope I am wrong!"
"The Fethiye Area was the same over Eid. Loads of people coming from the Cities and packing the beaches and putting up tents, no social distancing and no masks . The car queue from Hisaronu down to Oludeniz was bumper to bumper a 5 klm queue, people where actually waking down. Then when they all went, they left all their rubbish behind.Edited: 9:21 am, August 04, 2020 "
"Honestly, I can live with a spike in cases following a holiday - I may not like it, but I can understand it. But:I am not a fan of the TMA - some of their previous observations and suggestions during this epidemic have gone beyond the bizarre. And the report is a little self-contradictory. If things are as bad as the Ankara TMA deem, then I suspect healthcare personnel would, for example, be far more overworked than they report (not just the 2% who reported working over 66 hours a week, which is not all that unusual for some in hospitals anyway, and 80% working under 45 hours). However, the report is still shocking.Anyway, I leave it here for people to read or google-translate. It's certainly a report from a source that would be considered reputable and deserves to be brought to attention amidst all the data emanating from the Ministry of Health.Edited: 9:46 am, August 04, 2020 "
"As for the data emanating from the MoH, that's not looking good either. Istanbul's still doing relatively well, but elsewhere things are not really progressing as one would hope. I haven't input the numbers yet, but the W. Anatolia region *seems* to be now at almost double the infection rate of Istanbul, and the SE double that.I'll have more facts and figures for my next weekly update."
"An hour before the MoH reported a jump in cases to 1,083, the German authorities lifted their travel warning to Antalya, Muğla, Aydın and İzmir provinces, subject to a test taken 48 hours before travelling back. They must be feeling sheepish. :)"

Once again can I thank GG for his informative and evidence back reports and the figures are certainly worrying coupled with the figures from here in the UK and other European countries all indicating a rise.The after effects of Bayram and Eid are probably not going to register for another 2-3 weeks and such figures will not include tourists who travel who may be asymptomatic or who return home then test positive in their own country.I will be amazed especially after reading your post #315 that by the end of August Turkey is not in a similar position to Spain
"@GG, me too. :("
"Well, the numbers are up, certainly. You may ask why the weekly update has been delayed? While the national figures for the 5th have been announced, there's no daily situation report for the 4th yet (it does get delayed sometimes though I would have expected it to be up by now) and I'm waiting for that."

Very poetic GG- Isaiah 53:6
"Let us take a bleak break and talk about deaths. The following table gives the breakdown of the data by age group. Some of the data has been published (a ""Y"" in the ""Published?"" column) others have been calculated by me from that data (a ""Y"" in the ""Calculated?"" column). If a number has a grey background, it is approximate (deriving from very low numbers of fatalities and not enough sig. figs. in the mortality rate published by the government).https://imgur.com/ASxIoRQOther than for infants (and there the number of deaths is too low to say anything) we see mortality rates decline across the board in July and August compared with previous months. The overall mortality rate has declined from 2.64% in the period up to 28 June to 2.06% aftwards, and as you will see from the table, there is reduction in the number of cases involving those over 80 too - this explains much of the decline, though the average age of those falling ill has not gone down much if at all (the 65-79 group seems to have taken full advantage of their refound freedom). In addition, the treatment algorithms ( https://tinyurl.com/y2e4qc5h ) have been updated yet again; the main difference I see is the end of the use of placebos and the addition of the steroid dexamethasone; I hope that this means a further decline in the mortality rate in the coming months. [Background on the calculations. Let us take the ""25-49"" column as an example. The government published the number of deaths - 334 - for the period through to 28 June and the mortality rate - 0.34%. Using those two numbers we can calculate the number of people in that age group who were infected (98,235 or 49.7% of the total), as well as the proportion of deaths in that age group as a percentage of the total deaths (6.6%). Etc etc for all columns. Sources: https://tinyurl.com/y5ahxwd3 and https://tinyurl.com/yybqb23q ]"

Hi I’m just wondering if the infection rate per capita is available for turkey as a whole? The U.K. government used this data recently to put Spain and the Bahamas from the all but essential travel list meaning that I cannot go to Spain now as I quarantine for 14 days when I get back . Thanks!
"As of 10 August running at 94 cases per million over a 7-day period, as opposed to 90 in the UK and 554 in Spain and 635 in the Bahamas.

"Hi all - I'm due to head to cappadocia and Istanbul from the UK in just over two weeks time so understandably keeping a very close eye on figures - especially with the recent decisions to add quarantine measures for France and others. I'm really trying to get my head around the stats that the government are using which seems to be the new infection rate per 100,000 (my understanding is that it rises and stays above 20 per 100,000 for a few days, alarm bells start ringing). No matter where i look i cant seem to find this figure for Turkey anywhere. I can find 'cases per million' but that seems to be a different figure and for the life of me, my brain doesn't seem to understand the calculations i need to make! GrandGourmand seems to be pretty on the ball with this by the look if this thread so any guidance you can provide would be really appreciated. I've been using all of the links you've previously posted but cant seem to understand the data !"
"@bmovieneil: My understanding is that the 20 per 100,000 soft cut-off (evaluated together with the trend) is for a week's worth of cases. (If it were 20 per 100,000 per day, the numbers would be *really* bad - as bad as or worse than March or April.) Hover over the countries you're interested in in this graph https:/…new-covid-cases-per-million and divide those figures by 10 to arrive at the per-100,000 *daily* figure - currently around 1.4 per day for Turkey and the UK alike.Otherwise, I refer you to https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g293…Edited: 5:36 am, August 14, 2020 "
"And, continued, both Turkey and the UK are currently experiencing an upward trend in daily cases, and it could be that both could breach the 20/week limit. In fact, I would expect them to, a few weeks after schools re-open unless other measures are taken."
"Apologies for the delay this week. Real life has intervened. In short, numbers continue to rise, slower than feared, again mainly due to Istanbul's good numbers. But W. Anatolia has gone insane, Will give a proper update tomorrow."

"Thanks GG, really interesting I guess more social activity gives opportunity for infection and more testing means we know about it. Rates have risen a lot here since we’ve come out of lockdown, it’s all a bit tiresome. Hope the teeth behave now."
"I really, really hate this virus.It's dangerous (especially if you consider the long-term effects) but not dangerous enough (like MERS) that people die off before they can transmit it. It's transmissable by asymptomatic carriers, unlike virtually everything else - our ancestors could steer clear of plague carriers because they were coughing up blood, or smallpox patients because they were feverish, but we can't see who we should avoid. It's infectious enough to spread very rapidly, but apparently not infectious enough (as with say measles) that everyone takes it seriously. And the vaccination process is going to be complicated by people's fears of such a rapidly developed cure.Sometimes the whole thing is just too depressing."
"In an overdue step, the province of Erzurum will now require HES codes of those attending weddings and their parties (though obviously not for parties at home). Temperatures will also be checked. No-one over the age of 65 to be able to attend (outside of immediate family and grandparents of the groom and bride). Folk dances also prohibited. :oMay this become the norm in Turkey."
"Almost 75K tests today, revealing 1,233 new cases. Good and bad, I suppose.But I am getting rather annoyed about the regional reports being stuck on the 12th. If it's about accuracy and the virus has spread to hamlets on Ararat from which accurate data for the day cannot be transmitted back, I don't care. If it's an attempt to prevent panic in regions which are not doing well, I'd rather not be treated as a child. If it's because someone's gone on holiday, then it's appalling. I called around the appropriate Directorate General today and no-one seemed to have the least idea of what was going on."
"82K tests today ! :o And 1,263 new cases. Which by my calculation brings the 14-day total to 19.8 per 100,000 population (to put in in the same perspective as the ECDC figures) and 10.3 per 100,000 for the 7-day total (for those in the UK). These numbers may differ slightly from other sources - for example, I've noticed that World in Data uses a population of 84m, while I use 83, and their data follows with a day's lag....Quite a number of provinces have followed Erzurum (see the post two above)."
"87K tests, revealing 1,303 new cases. I wouldn't want to be in the shoes of the people in the T&T teams or the labs. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health has deigned to update the daily regional situation reports to the 16th; not much of a change over the 12th.It may be that they'll do these to coincide with the weekly report, which also appeared: https:/…...Also see https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g293…Edited: 2:34 pm, August 19, 2020 "
"Once again can I place on record my gratitude to GG for his informative posts.Looking at the figures you are reporting it feels as it only a matter of days before the figures breach the mythical 20 cases per 10,000 and the potential for the removal of the air bridges."
"A few other pieces of information from today's briefing - and while I'm critical of the Minister of Health for not insisiting more strongly at the highest levels that measures needed to be taken rather than tweeting platitudes, he has appeared every day since midnight on 11th March to gve information beyond what is merely reported in the daily figures, so bravo - as follows:1. There are now 9.344 test & tracking teams in the country. These are almost invariably composed of two people, one of whom is a doctor. The Minister said that the T&T teams were recently able to reach 98.9% of people who'd been in contact with those diagnosed with covid, which is an extraordinarily high proportion, but which should (more or less) be correct.I would also guess that the surge in test numbers has to do with the explosion of T&T. Strangely enough, the test positivity ratio has declined from about 2-2.5% two to three weeks ago to under 2% in the period since. This is welcome. And, yes, more tests do reveal more cases, but this is no excuse for reducing their numbers.2. Sivas and Şanlıurfa were mentioned as places where the number of new cases (and hospitalisations) threatened to overwhelm health services, but apparently ""things are now under control"". (As an aside, urfa in particular had a number of old hospitals that had been decommissioned; I suspect they've now been brought back into operation.)"
Natvic how did you reach the conclusion that the 20 threshold will be breached soon?That document showed the figure was 10.4 for Turkey overall?The UK’s figure is about the same
I was using the figures provided by GG on the 14 rolling day average which if remember correctly but glad to be corrected on is one the Uk Govt uses
"And, finally, since my post on the 16th, the number of laboratories authorised to process the PCR samples taken at hospitals, by the T&T teams, etc has expanded from 167 to 193, hwoever, this has has mainly been through an expansion in provinces which already head them existing . About 10 or so provinces still lack their own.Even so, had anyone told me on 11th March that we would have 193 labs processing 80,000+ tests a day spread throughout the country, I would have scoffed.The Turkish approach of ""We'd rather you didn't mingle too much and fall ill, and we're not that willing to stomp out egregious behaviour, but if you do fall ill, we'll accommodate you"" continues....There is some way to go before we hit 20 new cases per 100,000 per week. Numbers are up about 35% since the low point on 23rd June. At double that rate of daily increase, we'd hit 19/100,000 on 29th September."
The government use the 7 day average which is much lowerAccording to this Turkey’s numbers have floated around the same level since the end of Junehttps://ourworldindata.org/grapher/new-covid-cases-per-million?tab=chart&time=2020-03-12..latest&country=~TURI’m not saying Turkey definitely won’t go on the quarantine list but it’s certainly not as close to it as some newpapers are making out
"I hate to make any kind of forecasts with this virus, but I'd be surprised if Turkey didn't exceed 20/100,000 by mid-October, which is three weeks after schools re-open for some sort of reduced in-person education.Or it could reach that level next week or in December. My models aren't really worth much. :)"
"Many thanks again GrandGourmand that makes a very interesting read . We are off to Side in 10 days time for 2 weeks, ,having booked a month ago . So many people who we have told of our holiday have repeated the newspaper headlines of the past week that Turkey would be next in the list to quarantine. Thanks to you I have found Grant Schapps interview last week where he specified that the figure the U.K. looked at is over 7 days, not the 14 days that the papers were quoting . I am now able to point out to these people that yes the number of cases in Turkey is on the rise slightly but it would have to nearly double on a daily basis to exceed 20 per 100,000 population . Hopefully that will not happen but who knows ,in the meantime I am feeling a lot more positive that we will be going back to see our Turkish friends."

"Yes, let us hope for the best while continuing to take individual precautions. I know we're all suffering from covid response fatigue, but it appears we shan't have to be patient for too much longer.My favourite doctor-nurse, He Who Has Almost Always Been Right about Covid, Campbell of the Pathophysiologists, is beaming with happiness regarding various studies that have recently been published about the immune response to the virus.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Z6wdu1eI0In short, the body's response to the virus is (in almost all cases) exactly as one would hope, and this is good news for a vaccine. The virus does not appear to doing things (like HIV, and I will add, yellow fever) that would cause problems. And I will also add that reports about the antibodies disappearing after a while may be irrelevant in the light of this, as the body remembers the virus.So, God willing, and thanks to the astounding efforts of scientists all round the world, we may be perhaps 4-6 months away from decisively moving against this virus.

"93K tests, 1,309 new cases.Nothing very interesting in the Minister's comments today. There must be a limit to originality after doing 133 of these daily briefings."
"80K tests, 1,217 new cases....In other news, the Ministry of Health has approved Istanbul University's Facuty of Medicine to co-ordinate with the companies for the Turkish call for and oversight of volunteers to take part in the Biontech/Pfizer vaccine's Phase III trials. This is getting some pushback - not many see the need to be guinea pigs - but I suspect the requisite number will sign up. Turkish labs are yet to move beyond Phase I trials on their own vaccines so the government appears to be in talks with another (unspecified) consortium too.More on the proposed vaccine in question here: https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/pr… ....And the Turkish Medical Association has once again (this actually happens at least once a week, but most of the stuff's not that interesting so I don't bother reporting all that frequently) criticised the government. Their 16-point demands include better testing for frontline workers, for Covid-19 to be classed as an occupational disease for healthworkers (I'm surprised it hasn't alreday been), childcare facilities for health workers that are open 7 days a week, 24 hours a day (seems a bit of a stretch), a maximum of 6 hours in Covid-related wards (another stretch), T&T teams' meals to be covered by the state regardless of the hour of day (makes sense) etc etc. Not a hugely interesting list, but I hadn't posted anything from them for a while, so here it is."
"95K tests, 1,443 new cases, which is the highest since late June.When they update the situation reports (they seem to do them all in one go) I'll provide the usual weekly round-up."
"It's been two weeks since the last major update....DATA AS OF 30TH AUGUST, DAILY BRIEFING:7.03m tests, 270K infected, 6.3K dead, 244K recovered, 19.5K currently ill. Daily testing is now routinely over 90K or even 100K, and the number of qualified labs has now expanded to 223, with only (by my rough count) only 3 provinces missing their very own processing centre: Ardahan, Bilecik and Kırklareli. Ardahan has a population of 100K and is near enough to Artvin or Kars; Bilecik a population of 224K and near to Bursa, Bolu and other places; and Kırklareli, while it does have a population of 360K, is both next door to Istanbul and in the region with by far the lowest incidence of the virus.The number of positive cases have of course risen since the last update and now stand at a 7-day moving average of 12.5/100,000 and a 14-day moving average of 22/100,000. Overall, these numbers - while up by nearly two-thirds from a month ago - are depressing but manageable.The number of people currently ill has also risen by roughly that ratio and now stand at 19.5K; this is the highest number concurrently ill since the beginning of July. Still down by about three-quarters from the peaks seen in late April....DATA AS OF 23:59, 26TH AUGUST, SITUATION REPORT(This data is now routinely all announced in a batch, Wednesday or Thursday-ish.)(Using 7-day averages throughout, as numbers go up and down. ""Daily number"" refers to the average over the previous seven days.)I shan't be going over the regional data, but here's the graph of how things have developed over the course of the past two months or so:https://imgur.com/tgQGslOAs you can see, the situation is quite mixed. On the one hand, you have a region like the W. Marmara (Edirne, Çanakkale, Balıkesesir, etc) where things have barely moved over the course of this time period. Then there's Istanbul, which, despite a recent uptick, has come down smartly. The third variation is the South East Anatolia region (Gaziantep, Urfa, Diyarbakır, etc) which yo-yos up and down but in the stratosphere. The fourth major variation are the Central Eastern (Van, Malatya, etc), but in particular the Western (Ankara, Konta, etc), North East (Erzurum, Kars, etc) and Central (Kayseri, Sivas, etc) regions which have gone berserk.The difference between the larger, better organised industrial area (E. Marmara) and the smaller-scale establishments in or arounf Kayseri (and also Adana) is remarkable....One final point. These numbers are being aggressively challenged by both the TMA and those municipalities not held by the AKP. The TMA makes occasional forays, but despite being best placed to offer alternative data, their figures, when announced are patchy to the point of being beyond threadbare. And there is a fair amount of fairly dirty politics being played here (the CHP metropolitan mayors of Ankara and Istanbul in particular are both jockeying for position ahead of the 2023 elections) but on the whole the numbers still seem vaguely credible, IF:...the cases are indeed concentrated in factories...wedding- and funeral-related numbers are now on the decline following measures announced over the past two weeks....Whatever the case, the numbers are on a rise, and with schools due to re-open in some fashion in three weeks' time, I suspect this will be a long and difficult autumn and winter."
"That information is really helpful - there is no way I could have worked any of that out myself - math is not my strong point ! Given that the rate is now 12.5 / 100,000 over 7 days - is there anyway to work out an estimate of numbers continue as such to work out when Turkey would hit the 20% ? Obviously I understand that the numbers could go either way so it’s not an exact science ?"
"Let's try it this way. If the official rate of increase between 30th July and 30th August were to continue, we would see warning bells ringing (18/100,000 cases) around 25 September, and the 20/100,000 threshold breached on 3 October.But as we know, the virus's reproduction rate means that numbers can go up much more quickly than that, so take that forecast with a great dollop of salt. (Numbers could of course also go down, at least over the next three weeks...)"
