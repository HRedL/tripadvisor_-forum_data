"What impact has the virus had on hotels,restaurants,bars etc?"
"Business as usual here (at least from my perspective). If hotels had lots of cancellations I can‘t tell, though."
Thank you.
It has been announced tonight that the Fallas festivities have been cancelled.
"Yes, the Fallas has been cancelled due to the coronavirus."
Update: my impression from yesterday and today is that it’s been unusually quiet in the city. Much less busy on the streets and in restaurants.
There has been talk that the Fallas will be held later in the year.
"I am so sorry to hear this.We are due to come at the end of March - assuming flights still go ahead. Otherwise is everything still open? Are there any restrictions eg on public transport, restaurants etc?"
"It is still early to say, but it is going to be huge. They estimate at least 40% less bookings for Easter Holidays, but, if it continues like this, it will be worse. The biggest worry is the summer holiday season, because 12% of Spanish GDP comes from tourism."
According to the media the fallas will now be 15-19th july
Are the Museums and Art Galleries still open?
A state of emergency has been announced for the whole country for the next two weeks. Lots of major sites such as the alhambra etc are been closed so I'd be surprised if many are. Maybe look on visit valencia website for offical anouncements
"See my separate post. They have all been ordered to close from midnight on the 13th March until further notice :-( Restaurants and bars that is. Your hotel I would expect will keep their kitchens operating to feed residents but you may have to eat in your room.Edited: 3:45 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"UPDATE: Bed & Breakfasts, hotels and touristic apartments are allowed to be open from May 11th, until further order. The hospitality industries are now preparing their corona safety protocols, as advised by the government. Kind regards, Dany @ Bed and Breakfast Valencia Mindfulness Retreat .Edited: 3:23 pm, May 25, 2020 "
"That’s good news. Reports here in the UK are that when Spain reaches their phase three of their plan then borders may reopen and consideration will be given to allowing foreign travellers in to the country. Reports are that these at this stage will not include British and American visitors amongst others. Both countries are further behind with their virus control and reductions in numbers of deaths and contagion. German officials have advised their citizens to expect not to be travelling overseas for holidays this summer if not this year. I really hope that these pessimistic predictions are proven in time to be incorrect BUT I do have concerns that if people do start visiting from overseas before a vaccine is widely available and administered we could be potentially unwelcome visitors as the virus is not going to go away and understandably people will still be worried. Also, as with the Spanish flu, when restrictions were listed when this virus was prevalent infection rates quickly rose again. This will remain to be seen. I expect seeing this happen in the UK as there are too many dopey people out here who continue not to take the virus seriously and exercise social distancing. Spain’s stricter approach in my opinion was very sensible and I do not think you government will allow your citizens to be placed at risk with an influx of visitors from less robustly prepared countries. Which does disappoint me I miss Valencia."
Any news on whether the fallas has been cancelled altogether or is it still penciled in for mid july?
No fallas until 2021
Thanks
"If all ok (and it's a big if) we are booked for October 2020. Is the weather still fine then? We are not looking for hot days, just reasonable weather to get around and enjoy what Valencia has to offer.Thanks."
"Hello yes the weather should still be decent especially for those of us used to British weather. You should be experiencing temperatures in the low to mid 20’s. Hopefully come October there will be a new normal. It is likely to involve you having to wear a mask in Spain so think about this so you can make sure you have some. Keep an eye on developments with rules & regulations as the weeks pass. You certainly need them at this moment in Spain.Also ensure that your flight operator is still flying the route. I had my flights cancelled for a third week of July Trip to Valencia last week even though all signs are that travel will be permitted by then. My wife was relieved that they have been cancelled as she would prefer to see how tourists are initially received, but my suspicion is my airline, who have cut 1/3 of their workforce might have cut our route? We will see but this might be found to have happened due to the impact on airlines in more that one route?"
Thank you ethereal73. I too should have been in Valencia in April flying with Ryanair. I will certainly continue to keep up to date with any changes and hopefully as you say we can return to a 'new' normal.Thanks again.S1.
