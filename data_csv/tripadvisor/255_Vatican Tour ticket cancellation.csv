"Hi All,I want to cancel my Vatican tour ticket for June 2020, I tried the email on the ticket tours.musei@scv.va it bounced back, if anyone successfully canceled the ticket can you please share how you canceled the ticket ? I booked my ticket directly through the Vatican website.Thanks"
The website listed for assistance due to the COVID-19 closure is help.musei@scv.va
"ISN24:There is no need to contact the Vatican Museums if it remains closed to the general public. The Vatican Museums has automatically refunded tickets and tours as the forced closure continues on. I would guess that it is too early for June dates, however.They have usually been sending courtesy emails beforehand asking if you want the refund or if you would rather change the date of visit.Edited: 3:16 pm, April 25, 2020 "
If the museums are open in June I doubt they will refund your tour costs. They may allow you to change the dates but usually those tickets are non-refundable. If the museums are closed they will automatically refund you.Donna
"In early March, I realized my early April trip to Italy wasn't happening and used my one time Vatican date change to move my reservations to the end of June. Given that Italy will probably not be open without a lot of constraints at that time (14 day quarantine on either end) , I recently also cancelled my June flights and lodging and will try for later in the year or next year. If the Vatican is still closed at the end of June, I expect they will offer a refund or future date option, but if they are open do you think they will let me change it a second time to be used within a year? Thanks."
You would need to email them to see what they will offer. They may or may not allow a second change. Donna
"Thanks Donna - I emailed them three weeks ago, but received a generic reply about it will take some time before they get to me. I was hoping that someone else would post that they were allowed to move their date twice. I guess I'll have to be patient and let it play out."
With the lock down still in full force in Italy it may be some time before they can get back to you about a change in date. Being patient is the best thing to do. They will either refund you or allow you to change the date again. If they refund you you can simply rebook tickets for the dates you wish. donna
"Vatican Refund Update: On 5/29 I received an email from the Vatican museums that they would be reopening on 6/1, but due to all of the lower capacity requirements, couldn't honor my reservation for 6/22. and a full refund will be applied to my credit card within 60 days.I received an email yesterday that they processed the refund and I confirmed it hit my card as a credit. Hopefully, everyone who is waiting for a refund will get their credits soon."
Glad to hear your refund came through.
"For what it's worth, I found recently that the Vatican Museums' level of customer service in respect of refunds through the closure has been absolutely excellent."
Ian P -- glad to hear that you had. good experience getting a refund (we mostly hear from those who had the opposite experience here on the forum ...)
"The Vatican museums have been very good about doing automatic refunds. There hasn't been much of a need to contact them in order to get this refund, especially during the shut down. It's good to hear you've had success.Donna"
