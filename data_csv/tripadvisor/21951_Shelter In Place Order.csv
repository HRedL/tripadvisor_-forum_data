A Shelter in Place order will be announced today for the Bay Area according to the chronicle. Short of a lockdown but seems to be headed that way.

"I got tired of reading social media posts stating that this was ""just another flu"" so I looked at the numbers. In 2019 California had 2,900 deaths over a 14-week flu season. California is approximately the size of the country of Italy (California is a bit larger). As of today (3/16) Italy has seen just under 2, 200 COVID-19 deaths in about three weeks. I hope the rest of the country (and the world) starts to take this seriously.Edited: 5:52 pm, March 16, 2020 "
I heard an interview with a doctor treating folks in the State of Washington and it scared the he-double toothpicks out of me. This is no flu.
This is a serious question... Are the liquor stores in San Francisco going to be open during the Shelter In?
>>Are the liquor stores in San Francisco going to be open during the Shelter In?<<Not sure but grocery stores sell alcohol and they will remain open.
"A lot of the liquor stores in SF also sell groceries, so I would be very surprised if those shut down.I'm one of those that thinks this is overblown. I've been tracking the coronavirus progression at https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/. According to Wikipedia, 150,000 die worldwide every day. Yesterday, 638 people worldwide died from causes associated with coronavirus. In the US, about 7500 people die every day. Yesterday, 18 deaths were associated with coronavirus. I don't think that's enough to justify the panic that's going on now.Edited: 8:16 pm, March 16, 2020 "
"sfimporter.... I read a post from a nurse in Seattle who wrote it to a nurse in Tennessee.She said Seattle is considered Ground Zero for COVD-19 in the states. Seattle's first case was a man in his 40's who recovered. The nurse said they all thought ""Great. No worries"" and didn't think any more about it until the virus started showing up elsewhere in the states. She looked up Patient Zero out of curiosity. What she read about his case ""woke"" her up. Yes, he recovered, but his condition was dire at times.She told her friend in Tennessee that she expects this virus will explode in 3 weeks time and to learn from the mistakes they made in WA state and hoped they would be better prepared.She ended her letter by stating that Disneyland would be closing in a few days and that, as a former Californian, she thought she would never see the day.COVD-19 is not a flu. It's closer to being pneumonia and it leaves permanent scarring on the lungs of those who suffer the brunt of the illness.Still too many out there not taking this thing seriously. Yes, most people have minor symptoms and recover fine. We have treatments for colds and flus. We don't for COVD-19. We need to take personal responsibility and lay as low as possible to prevent or lessen the spread.This is not the time for unnecessary travel.Stay well, everyone.Edited: 8:20 pm, March 16, 2020 "
Shelter in place Santa Cruz County.
"3chihuahuas, your one particular case doesn't override the larger data. There are about 100 gun deaths in the US every day. About 100 people die in car crashes every day in the US. Compare that to the 18 that died from coronavirus-related causes yesterday.Not saying that people shouldn't wash their hands, but the media too often succumbs to feeding frenzies, where it exaggerates and sensationalizes. Then the public gets caught up in it and panics. Then the media reports on the public panic, which causes even more panic. It all feeds on itself. People should be more worried about getting shot or hit by a car than dying from coronavirus."
"Simba, I’ve yet to see any panic. Hoarding yes but the stores are limiting what people can buy now. My town had come together like never before . Citizens are volunteering to pick up drop off elderly people’s groceries. Moms are watching working mom’s kids. No panic just trying to make this work.This is serious. If you have an underlying health condition like 3 chis husband it can be scary. The shelter in place may be a bit much but since a big portion of people can’t seem to self regulate I feel the powers that be felt this was necessary. It’s weird times for sure.Edit for 3 chis. Salons are closing. My friend just closed her’s for two weeks. Gyms are in the process of closing. AFAIK the mall is open but who would be there? Restaurants are open but most are doing take out only. A few restaurants have closed. The libraries are closed. Theaters are closing.Edited: 8:48 pm, March 16, 2020 "
That's good. I can still get my medicinal whisky and medicinal marijuana.
"From technology review:https:/…On similarities and differences between flu and Coronavirus.We are sitting this out in San Diego. Have hoarding but not seemingly as crazy as Bay Area.Edited: 9:30 pm, March 16, 2020 "
Reliable medical sources in the US agree that it’s going to get worse before it gets better. But no one can say by how much because SO much depends on citizens being smart. Stay home. Don’t hoard. If people don’t the health care system will be overwhelmed. That’s what medical experts are saying. NOT the media. France has 300-400 people in ICU and half are under 60. Young people here should take notice.
"Yes, many people die from tragic accidents, homicides, etc. And flu, of course. But those deaths (and near-deaths requiring intensive care) are spread out over time and place, not hundreds of patients needing ICU care within a few days time in the same locality. THAT'S why this one is different and worth slowing down as much as possible."
"RKCa, I made it a point to give deaths per day to make various sources of death comparable. 100 deaths per day from guns. 100 deaths per day from car accidents. 18 deaths yesterday from coronavirus. Yet society shuts down over coronavirus, and not guns or cars.Edited: 10:25 pm, March 16, 2020 "
">>18 deaths yesterday from coronavirus. Yet society shuts down over coronavirus<<But how many will there be a week from now, two weeks from now, a month from now? That is what we dont know."
"Numbers have always been slippery, tricky things for me, so I thank you Simba for putting things in perspective. This barrage coronavirus news has me fearful of venturing outside to buy groceries; I find it comforting to know I take a greater risk when I start up my car. And I find it even more comforting to reflect that I have never personally, thank goodness, known anyone killed in a car accident.Oh, I will continue to be a good citizen and do everything I'm supposed to, but I don't really get why our (the world's) reaction to this virus is so different from previous ones? I'm not being argumentative, I really don't understand."
"If new cases are tripling every couple of days I think some extrapolation is possible. Besides, one need only look at Italy. We are now where they were about 2 weeks ago. Gun deaths run on a flat line. This thing is on an almost vertical one. Lots of difference."
"If anyone wants to read the whole order, here it is.https:/…stay-home-except-essential-needs"
">>> to make various sources of death comparable. 100 deaths per day from guns. 100 deaths per day from car accidents. 18 deaths yesterday from coronavirus. <<<And if coronavirus continues to kill only 18 people a day, it won't be that big a deal. But it's currently killing 350 people a day in Italy, a country with a population one fifth the size of the population of the USA. So if we follow the same trajectory as Italy, it could become an absolutely huge deal!"
"Flu is flu; we’re all familiar with it, we’ve all had it, and many of us get a little nonchalant about it, including me. I admit I could take flu more seriously, especially since I’m not a spring chicken.The definition of a pandemic is a disease that spreads widely within a region, country, or around the world, where it has not existed before. (If it existed before and has become established, like flu, it would be called endemic). The biggest risks of a pandemic disease are not necessarily how severe it is or how many people die from it right away. One risk is the fact that it IS new, so we know little or nothing about it, how it starts, propagates, what predisposes a person to it, or what it does over its cycle in people’s bodies. Those are things we learn only from observation, meaning that people have to get sick and die before we know much about it Another risk is that when it first shows up, no one has ever had it, and of course there is no vaccine for it, so no one is immune either by having been inoculated or having recovered. Since we don’t know much about it and the factors in the previous paragraph, we have to presume that anyone can be infected. And since we don’t know its seasonal cycle through the year, we have to make educated projections about how it might act in a month or two, how weather changes affect it, all the different populations it might target, etc.Once we know more about it and what it does, from observing it and the people it hits over a year cycle, we’ll know a lot more and might be in a better position to be nonchalant about it."
"In the US, total cases from coronavirus-related factors have gone up roughly 45% over the last two days, from 696 on the 14th to 983 on the 16th. Much of that increase is going to have to do with the increase in testing rather than the virus actually spreading at a 45% rate every two days. In the same two days, total deaths in the US have gone from 8 to 18. I guess you can alarm people by saying the number of deaths has more than doubled over the last two days, but it's still only 18 deaths. Italy is the worst case, and there''s no reason to assume we're going follow the same pattern as Italy rather than lots of other countries with coronavirus cases that aren't nearly in as bad shape."
">>> and there''s no reason to assume we're going follow the same pattern as Italy rather than lots of other countries with coronavirus cases that aren't nearly in as bad shape <<<Yes there is, there is every reason to assume we're going to follow the same pattern as Italy because we've prepared extremely poorly. The countries that dealt with the coronavirus and appear to have it under control (Korea being one) are the countries who had hugely aggressive action plans, lockdowns, widespread testing etc."
"Italy has a population of about 60 million with total 2,158 coronavirus-related deaths.The UK has a population of about 66 million with 55 total deaths.France also has a population of about 66 million with total 148 deaths.Germany has a population of about 83 million with 17 total deaths.Why are people so convinced we're going to end up like Italy rather than the UK, France or Germany?"
"It just started spreading in the UK, Spain, France and Germany. Just wait 2 more weeks."
"People have been running around with it for some time in US...just couldn't (or wouldn't) be tested. I know several people that have said in the last month that they had the ""worst flu of their life"" not sure how anyone can be sure it wasn't covid...."
"By chance, my office shared a copying machine and a kitchen with a county public health department for several years. I found the public health staff to be a dedicated and careful group, not the type to be swayed by fads and shifting public opinion. I think we can trust the judgment of the County Public Health Officers who are issuing the ""stay home"" orders."
"For those using data to argue this is overblown, we can’t rely on any data because people aren’t being tested for this yet. A few yes, but even in the heavily populated areas such as SF cases are being diagnosed and the people who have been in contact with those patients are being denied tests. SFState has a positive employee and those in contact have been denied tests. Thousands more situations like this are playing out across the land."
"Data doesn't indicate that we're in for an Italy-like situation, either."
"But data does indicate that if one takes the issue seriously and tackles it, one can be successful. Taiwan is a model, and Singapore has been excellent, too. Even Korea, which has big hot spots, is coming to grips with the situation and is full of testing stations. Koreans are very individualistic, but they are also very well informed and willing to be publicly minded ..... Italy is the bad path. Korea the much better. Leadership matters. Followership does too."
"Data doesn't indicate we're not going to be in an Italy-like situation soon if we continue with business as usual, either.Did people in Italy not know how to wash their hands? Why do you think the results in Italy will be so different than here as time goes on and if we did the minimal amount? Different areas of the world have been dealing with this in different ways and different stages of the cycle. The countries that have done the best of those that encountered spread early on have limited spread by extensively limiting contact or done extensive testing or both. The US has done neither of these before very recently. Some towns in Italy where spread was allowed to continue have had as many deaths in a month as in the entire previous year.Feel free to go out and take chances to get infected if it only affects you and you're committed not to take medical resources. But it doesn't just affect you if you're out with the virus and infecting others."
"Last week, our MD sent emails to patients urging each of us to remain inside for two weeks in order to protect ourselves, family and others.While it may feel like we're a grounded 15 year old, it's for everyone's health and well being. And it's also a good time to be patient while participating in old or new inside activities: Scrabble, cooking a new recipe, baking your mom's to-die-for brownies, reading that book purchased three years ago, checking yourself on algebra or calculus problems you haven't done in years, (thank you, Google), yoga, cleaning out that closet, etc."
"""Why do you think the results in Italy will be so different than here as time goes on and if we did the minimal amount?""Because there are many countries where the coronavirus is circulating, and most of them aren't nearly as bad off as Italy. Statistically the chances are we'll be like one of those other countries."
Testing still isn't happening as much as it should. I know someone sheltering in a hotel right now. They had a fever but were told that they wouldn't be tested because they couldn't say if they had come into contact with someone already infected. So they are riding this out at the hotel rather than risking spreading something to their family. We're nowhere near on top of this thing.
Might be instructive:https:/…
"An authoritative data-based study that forced Boris Johnson to change course, and which might have pushed our own inept president to accept the reality of the threat:https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51915302"
This is something that hasn't happened on this scale probably since 1918 so it tough to know how to react.
"NO! It's very easy to know how to react. You stay home and away from other people unless you have to go to the grocery or pharmacy. Really, how hard is that?"
"Because of inept national leadership, we are way behind doing this right. Social distancing is a necessary but insufficient component. It has to be combined with testing, quaranting the infected, and curing to the extent possible. Even if an insufficient component, still necessary. Otherwise we will overwhelm the likes of chinita and her colleagues."
"There is now evidence that at least half the people who are carrying the virus are asymptomatic, based on a study in the Italian town of Vo. https://www.sfgate.com/coronavirus/article/I…Some of the findings:""Every single resident was tested for coronavirus in late February... and three percent of inhabitants were found to be carrying the virus.""""Andrea Crisanti, an infections expert at Imperial College London, was involved with the experiment and told news outlets that half of the carriers exhibited no symptoms.""""Anyone who tested positive was placed under quarantine, as were individuals that came into recent contact with the infected. The town's residents were then tested again 10 days later, and just .3 percent of the population was found to be carrying the virus. However, at least six infected individuals were asymptomatic and would not have been tested in most other countries.""The lesson isn't that every single person should be tested (clearly not practical at this point). The lesson is just because everything seems normal, doesn't mean that people should be acting as normal."
"I just signed up for a mail order pharmacy and my local Safeways deliver, as do even some of our best restaurants, now and I suppose for the duration."
"And be kind during this time. Some neighbors are elderly and could use a hand with groceries or company. Some neighbors have developmentally disabled adult children living with them, in a loving home. Running to get groceries, offering to go outside for a walk, bringing in a meatloaf with a fresh loaf of bread, bean salad on mixed greens, steamed veges, maybe bottle of wine or a beer or bottle of carbonated water makes a differenceKindness to others matters, especially during difficult times.Edited: 7:31 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"Even if the offer is declined, others get that you thought of them and made an effort. For many, falling asleep with gratitude makes a difference."
The latest Covid19 death down here was a 30 something year old. It’s not all old geezers like me.
"Company? As in going to visit someone at their home?That is one of the no-no's specifically mentioned in San Francisco's health order. Residents are not to visit except with those in the household where they normally live. If you mean sitting in their front yard (which not every home here has) and they sit in their open doorway and you converse from a distance, maybe that would follow the spirit of the order :^)"
"On our Nextdoor internet group, people have been offering help to anyone who needs a helping hand, such as grocery shopping.We have also have some neighbors asking for emergency supplies of TP or Tylenol, and lots of responses to help."
"Still need to be careful on next door.com. Not immune to scam, merely less prone."
"Because of modern mobility, this is potentially much worse than 1918. We have better medicine, but we have many, many more people over 60 now."
"But we are not a world devastated and exhausted by world war.We are not in a worse situation than 1918. But we need great leadership and great followership, with scientific experts encouraged and respected, and a collaborative attitude with foreign countries."
It will be tough to conquer because the world population is much more now. Have a hard time believing the virus started via bats.
"Coronavirus is endemic in human beings. But there are occasional ""novel"" ones which are especially virulent. SARS and MERS were also novel coronaviruses.At least some possible treatment drugs originated in studies aimed at dealing with SARS. The testing kits in Korea originated in that country's fumbling in handling MERS, prompting some companies and government sxperts to fast track getting test kits out fast."
"Looking at today's numbers, so far it looks like Governor Newsom did a good thing - as did all of the counties who shut down before the state gave the order. New York: 6,834 casesCalifornia: 982 casesGovernor Cuomo, who really waffled until today, it would seem, didn't act quickly enough.And yes, there are other circumstances that can contribute to varying numbers (not the least of which is testing) - but that's a huge difference. Here's to hoping our numbers stay low!"
"I wonder if could be because New York State has more highly densely populated urban areas, where social distancing is harder. California has its crowded urban areas, but our land area is bigger and overall more rural, so fewer people are literally in each other's faces all the time."
"I looked at CNN's number published at 3:53 today.CA 1,001NY 7,102If accurate ... CA went up by 20, NY by 300. Granted, they have that terrible hot spot in New Rochelle and NYC was quite slow to shut down. Hopefully CA's numbers indicate success in social distancing and the NY's PAUSE works.Edited: 6:59 pm, March 20, 2020 "
There is a lot of rural space in NY state. I wouldn't want to argue that it's more than CAs but upstate's population is tiny compared the NYC Metro area.
Too early to draw conclusion. Full regimen of approach still not in place in California.
CNN at 6:46 Pacific time reports CA 1077NY 8377We aren’t going to get all the stuff Liars keeps harping on for some time. Social distancing is ALL we have for next month. Probably more given the fact that our national leadership might all be wearing red plastic noses. I’m certainly not laying my life on these numbers. But the are eye opening.
"Liars wants informed, serious national leadership and educated, committed followership. Not having the former undermines having the latter.So we are indeed on our own with state and local leadership and willing enough followership so that more strict guidelines might not be necessary. Governor Newsom admits not knowing all the answers, but at least his is a consistent approach, conveyed regularly, and encompassing all the components of a Korea-like path even if presently without all the components thereof....something he admits."
"Hard to be patient (and kind) while stuck at home. Might help to shut up #62 and use a pad of paper to write how this lousy experience has had an impact.All of us are are doing our best, right? Right. I get loud & clear that you're angry and a likely response will soon follow. So be it.This might be an outrageous suggestion, but IMAGINE that others lead a life far harder than you. Imagine."
#64 as usual is completely misinterpreting.
"Typical and expected. Please, engage.. While most in the SF Bay Area celebrate each other and forum posts, So glad the Bay Area is stepping up to the plate with Shelter In Place requirements.It's not easy, but doable. May all of us across the U.S. continue."
"San Francisco has illustrated over the years the backbone and resilience it has. My city of origin has a strong back and locals that embrace the globe and all it's challenges.None of us are perfect (speaking as a former-San Franciscan), but we step up and we fight for what's needed. Today is no different. Love, kindness, generosity is no different. None of us look the same, speak the same language or eat the same food, but ALL of us celebrate a free life differently. May we all continue across the U.S. accordingly."
"I'm with Liars on this one. I hardly even pay attention to the confirmed cases, which are highly distorted and incomparable between states because of lack of testing. I'm focused more on the death count and how it's increasing."
"Confirmed cases are distorted only by being low. It’s not that confirmed cases are false. But trends are important. Besides which, this is the only info that will be available for at least a month since testing is woefully behind. I have no idea what point Globe is trying to make."
"This is the best aggregate data for the US I have seen.https://covidtracking.com/data/The denominators are variable due to testing. There are also deaths that might have been caused by COVID that are not counted yet or never. We are a month behind. Those of us in healthcare in California are battle ready and just waiting for the tidal wave to come. It is eerily quiet in primary care practices since we switched to telemedicine for the most part earlier this week. We hope the wave never come as folks stay home. We really don't want a primary care pediatrician or a pathologist taking care of you or your loved ones in the ICU or ER.Edited: 9:59 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"Since I periodically bring up Korea, here is that country’s stats: https:/…By no means perfect, and there are flare ups, but the curve is okay.

"While I was a practicing globalist.....licit flows of money, goods, people, and ideas mostly to, from or through East Asia....our kids are in biochemistry, molecular biology, basic research, oncology treatments, and, marginally, viral research. My German daughter in law noted that what hot spots Italy, Colorado, Switzerland, Germany, France, and others have in common is skiing....and the international travel involved in infecting and spreading. I think there is something to that observation."
"@Liars, I would also wonder what the infection/death rate is in places where the population regularly must take anti-malarial drugs?And also, just when this bug got to the US. I know a few people, just here, who got very ill last December. Some had traveled, others had not. They all recovered."
"Trump should just shut up.To tackle this, there have to be screening of possibly infected, testing, tracing people in contact with infected people, isolating those infected, treating those who are ill. China, through draconian measures, has a handle over this despite a big cost through initial mismanagement. We ought to seek their help. Korea, through much less draconian measures, also appears to have a handle on this. We should seek their help too.Americans can probably buy out the entire malarial medication array out there even without solid evidence that it works. But that would leave millions of people who need those malarials. Just look at the stupid hoarding of toilet paper going on, even though we have enough toilet paper being produced.Covid-19 is what is called a zoonotic disease because it jumped from an animal, more than likely bats, to us and because bats....and for that matter migratory birds which are also big zoonotic disease transmitters....are not killed by the virus actually make the viruses stronger and because we dont have the bat protections they can become really virulent in human beings.I think the origin story of Wuhan is probably accurate, but to scapegoat China is counterproductive at this pandemic stage.Instead we need to focus on screening, testing, tracing, isolating, treatment. Social distancing is necessary but insufficient as I have said. Way behind on the other components.Edited: 2:01 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"I think it will be quite a while before enough testing can be done. News today says they'll run out of reagents within weeks. The feds needs to step up and it's not just about a bailout. It's about actively instituting defense production. TELLING industries to start making masks and other equipment and eliminating price gouging. (Gov. Cuomo says a mask they bought for $.80 are now priced at $7. While FEMA is throwing it back on the governors. ""If you can get it, buy it."") For right now social distancing is the ONLY thing we have in quantity. Crossing our fingers for malarial treatment to be successful as a treatment but that's yet to be proven."
"Reporting from the healthcare frontline again...We are beyond individual contact tracing and contacting then isolation. That level of control is time and labor consuming and public health does not have the resources. That is why the stay at home orders were made. Community transmission is here and the arbitrary criteria of a known travel history to level 3 countries and known positive for testing is ridiculous. People are seriously running out of PPE. In my circle of friends across the country, people in all different settings are making due. CDC loosened guidelines for protection (bandanas WTF?!?) not because it is safe but because we don't have enough stuff. Some of my acquaintances are making fabric reusable surgical masks with HEPA filters from vacuum cleaners. People are doing crazy McGyver stuff like using a sealed plastic bag with carbon dioxide monitor or using BVM/ambu bag masks an filter.There are people with extra supplies from the wildfire, industries (tattos, nails, construction.) Plugging our local efforts:http://vmcfoundation.org/covid19/WE STAY AT WORK FOR YOU. PLEASE STAY AT HOME FOR US."
>>We are beyond individual contact tracing and contacting then isolation. That level of control is time and labor consuming and public health does not have the resources. That is why the stay at home orders were made. <<I completely agree.
"chinita415 ~ I have always enjoyed reading your posts on the forum, but your views & opinions are especially valued now. Thank you for taking a moment to share reports ""from the healthcare frontline"" with the TripAdvisor community.I am staying home for you, your family, my family, healthcare workers everywhere, and all the other people."
"Chinita, thank you for your work.I think you are correct that the fast ticking of the clock of the disease means we can’t catch up to do the proper screening and tracing. Not having that strong informed leadership early in the game has hurt us badly and you and your colleagues are unfortunately suffering the consequences.Stay safe."
"Another possible side-effect of sheltering-in-place to look out for in your family, friend, or neighbor circle: more domestic violence. Even in good times, some people will abuse family members, but at least there are more options for both the abusee and the abuser when life is normal: relatives, friends, shelters, attorneys, therapists or other advocates or interveners. It’s easier to call 911 and have the police respond quickly when the community isn’t in the midst of another emergency.A major disaster is stressful enough, but this is the kind where you don’t evacuate and you’re not around a lot of people who can see trouble coming. It’s an emergency where you stay at home, isolated with only your own household. If it extends over some time and whole families are cooped up together, even normal, reasonable people can get on each other’s nerves. Normal people have arguments, but add in confinement, limited private time and space, worry about health, maybe job loss with economic impacts, it may make an abusive person worse or bring out the negative side of someone who previously hadn’t manifested. With limited contact with people outside the household, an abusee is more isolated and an abuser may feel more empowered. So we ought to at least be aware of the possibility, in people around us and maybe in ourselves.https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/3/21/21188…"

But very definitely forcibly isolated in various clusters.And highly stressful maybe especially stressful for hard chargers, active comparatively privileged families, and our single folks.We mitigated this by using phone trees and e-mail chains to check in on one another, offering help with shortages, keeping people in touch with one another. This was admittedly a small, self collected group of people, but we do have communities here maybe not as cohesive as we may want. I do like the concept that Governor Newsom put forward of partnering with next door.com to foster some looking out for seniors or other already isolated people. I also note that my San Francisco nextdoor group has 37% participation whereas my San Diego one has 87%.....I attribute that to the high percentage of non-English speakers in my SF neighborhood, mitigated by local churches but undermined by the closing of local HK style tea shops.....haven’t lived until getting sweetened British tea with milk....yuck.But we should indeed be cognizant of stress, and the possible negative manifestation thereof. So even while being social distanced, do check in virtually and virtuously with friends and family."
"The Chinese speaking tech savvy seniors in the Bay Area are not on Nextdoor. They are on WeChat and other apps familiar with Asians. Our extended family is on Messenger, WhatsApp and WeChat checking on each other. Those connected to senior services previously are getting things delivered to them and calls.My mom is sewing fabric masks for other seniors and healthcare workers. My dad is in a memory care assisted living center and we have not been able to visit him in a couple of weeks. Calling and Facetime sometimes make him more agitated so we just check in with staff.Edited: 4:05 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"Thank you, Chinita, to you and to all the healthcare professionals, Americans (everyone, planetwide) rely on. Thank you! Thank you! Many Americans have pre-existing conditions, including asthma, diabetes & heart disease and are vulnerable to becoming severely ill if exposed to COVID-19. Thank you, again!"
"WeChat, of course. I am embarrassed. My firm has business ties with Tencent, and I have even met Pony Ma.And we used WeChat....not anymore though, having moved to kakaotalk since we spent much more time in Korea,Again, many thanks to you and your colleagues.Edited: 4:12 pm, March 22, 2020 "
