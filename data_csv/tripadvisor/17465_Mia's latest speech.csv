"Did you not watch her live ASO I told you she was on tv last night . She is truly a wonderful speaker whether people agree with her or not .Edited: 1:24 pm, March 27, 2020 "
"Mia does indeed speak very well, a calm and measured speech."
Good news that so far ventilators have not been required. Long may it remain. I hope her medical procedure goes well.
I really feel for everyone in Barbados - let's hope the solution is found quickly
"So why do you have to post this Canby ?  Do you not think we can read our own newspapers ? Would visitors be interested in this and if they are , do you , don’t you think they can investigate for themselves ?  This thread is about Mia’s lovely eloquent speech , nothing else . Why not concentrate on what your Government is doing in Canada .Edited: 2:57 pm, March 27, 2020 "
"My aplogies Canby, but I just read the title and I have become used to your negative posts of late . Mia culpe ."
Think that's an unfortunate typo under the circs Westie - should be Mea culpa (not Blame Mia !! LOL)
Re your post 5 no I don;t watch TV -( and I was having a major panic about not being able to just get my limo as usual - and needing family assistance in sorting it out prepaid for me)
thanks Westie
"I think Canby's post would be of interest ...well to me anyhow ....if I could read it ...link broken ???I find it fascinating to see how other countries are handling this ...especially given how badly the UK has dealt with it So far I think Mia and her team have out performed Boris on every frontWent to the Nation website ...noticed a article about ""Opposition Senator Caswell Franklyn"" ... I thought there was no opposition after the 2018 Election ....???Edited: 7:10 am, March 28, 2020 "
"After the Election Mdp , they had to form an Opposition as there wasn’t a real one ."
"MDP “ ...especially given how badly the UK has dealt with it” “ So far I think Mia and her team have out performed Boris on every front”This is your opinion.I think the UK government are doing an excellent job, you obviously don’t, so best we leave it there!!!"
Very well said Chris G.
"Chris and Joan IMO the number of infections, recoveries and deaths per capita will determine if the UK government did a good job in handling this. Also comparing the steps taken in the UK with those taken in other countries will reveal what was the best approach."
"Yes exactly NC “What was the best approach?”. We won’t know for a long time and I am sure there will be a lot of lessons to be learnt by everyone once this is all over. I was making exactly that point. How can MDP make judgements as to how badly the UK government are handling things and that “Mia is outperforming Boris on every front”. It’s his opinion. In the same way as it’s my opinion that the UK government are doing an excellent job in handling the crisis. Whether they are doing better than anyone else I don’t know and won’t know for a long timeWe’ll just have to wait and see and hope and pray that the actions being taken across the world by every government beats this terrible virus.Edited: 8:20 am, March 28, 2020 "
"""""""I think the UK government are doing an excellent job, you obviously don’t, so best we leave it there!!!""""""Yes it is my opinion but supported by facts I could list MANY areas where our Government has failed its citizens by in general acting far too slowly - unlike the Government of Barbados ...but this is unfortunately not the forum for a detailed responseAll I would say Chris and Joan is that I have 2 close relatives and many friends working in the NHS - one has caught Covid 19 and already returned to work. They tell you the truth about what is ACTUALLY happening in respect of testing and PPE rather than the meaningless ""as quickly as possible"" promises of the GovernmentAlso might be worth considering some of the press articles now comparing the UK response compared to S Korea, Japan, Singapore and China .... just take a look at the number of deaths in those countries"
"Chris G, post19It's a shame there isn't a like button on these threads."
"mdp, here we go again.What has your post got to do with Mia's speech?"
"MDP instead of making political points you should note the govt are taking advice from the Senior Medical Officers and other scientific advice. Then compare the UK to Italy Spain and other European countries of similar size to UK.I am sure, in hindsight, a lot of lessons will have been learnt and will show how things could have been done better. But as has been said this is something totally new to the world.Finally it would help if people actually followed the advice/instructions coming from the govt./medical advisers.As Barbados have the advantage of seeing how countries have reacted across Asia, Europe and North America let us hope and pray they are taking the right action for their citizens."
"""""""Whether they are doing better than anyone else I don’t know and won’t know for a long time""""""Sorry Chris ...some things, yes, will take time .... but already we know that our deaths are more than japan (Pop 126m) and S Korea (Pop 52M) and Taiwan (Pop 24m)Brilliant article in today's Daily Telegraph highlighting how we have failed to learn from other countriesTake a look at the videos of the S Korean and Chinese PPE equipment ...even now have nothing like that We had a 3 - 4 week lead on the Far East and wasted it ...shameful .... and all that crap about 'herd immunity' was false science .....fact not opinionIf you really want to be convinced --- try and track down BBC Question Time last week and listen to Richard Horton - Editor in Chief of the Lancet ......facts not opinionAnd finally ...why have we stopped putting visitor / returning citizens into isolation (as we did at the beginning) ...like Barbados are doing ...plenty of empty hotelsEdited: 10:49 am, March 30, 2020 "

"MDP the member for St. Michael West after being elected, decided to become a private member and therefor became the opposition."
"""""""MDP instead of making political points...""""""John ... I am not making political points, I have a fair amount of respect for Boris as a politician and what he is now trying to do for our country ...pre Covid 19 that isOne problem however, is that generally speaking he supports libertarianism and therefore he found it very difficult to 'order' the people to do something against their free will. He has a very high intellect but like many of that ilk he can sometimes lack common sense and pay insufficient attention to the smaller details """"""advice from the Senior Medical Officers and other scientific advice""""""Indeed ...and maybe that is part of the problem ... now an increasing number, there have always been some who have expressed a counter view ...based on the experiences in the Far East .. with Covid19, SARS and MERS. They were ignored for too long whilst we dallied with 'herd immunity. Was Boris hiding behind this statement to justify something that in principle he disliked…and there is insufficient space to go into the peer reviews of the historical work of the modelling expert Neil Fergusson …another ‘expert’""""""this is something totally new to the world """"""Not strictly true .... Covid 19 is technically SARS-CoV-2 and this family of viruses has been known about in the animal kingdom for some time. There are other 'versions' waiting to emerge. If the Governments of the world and China in particular had spent just a tiny fraction of their economic packages on developing a pre-vaccine .... well who knows """"""Finally it would help if people actually followed the advice/instructions coming from the govt./medical advisers""""""Totally and utterly agree. Unfortunately, great swaths of the UK population are not that good at taking 'advice' from politicians or experts. You have only got to look at a fraction of the words on social media to see this. A much earlier and drastic lockdown would have been more effective and perhaps a few troops on the streets would have emphasised the importance of social distancing Good news just reported …an idiot claiming to have Covid 19 spat at a policeman - he has been sentenced to 1 year in jail So long as the actions (or lack) of the UK Government continue to put members of my close family working in the NHS at unnecessary risk I will continue to ask questions and provide facts"
NC ...thanks for that ... puts a new meaning to the phrase ' one man regime' ...or opposition !!
For goodness sake does a travel forum need all this self opinionated diatribe?
Canby ...thanks for that I have posted about this in another TopicUK Business press items about Virgin Atlantic have been running for some time ... pre Covid 19 ... I think it is 4 years since they made a profit and one reason why Branson pulled out of the Air France / KLM deal
Maybe factual diatribe ...what is not correct in that post
"It’s a travel forum I missing something?Mdp you seem to relish scoring points over the UK government, many of us have relatives/friends working in our wonderful NHS."
"Agree,our wonderful NHS are truly brilliant in this crisis.Such a shame they are so desperately short of the protective equipment they need,which we have been told over many weeks,has been ordered and is on it's way.Hope lives are not lost,meanwhile."
"Thanks for that detailed response MDP. You were sounding as if you were political point scoring rather offering an opinion on the actions taking by ""our leaders"". I certainly agree with a lot of what you say. I have sympathy with Johnson's wish not to impose restrictions too early because people could start ignoring it just when the restrictions are most important.Time will tell which country took the right action, if any, and let's hope the world learns for when the next virus invades.I certainly worry for those in the NHS as well as those still working for our benefit - the check out staff at supermarkets, pharmacies dustmen etc. We owe them all a debt of gratitude"
"The considered responses are appreciated .... and yes I do get VERY passionate about my country, the NHS and my family when they are put at greater risk than they should be Of course this is a travel forum ...and this particular topic is about a speech and action of the PM of one country Barbados, and in some posts compartive examples of the actions of another PM In these incredibly challenging times the actions of virtually all the world leaders have restricted our travel arrangements and therefore (IMO) should come under scrutiny A wise and sensible leader should be able to learn from the previous actions of others and act accordingly"
See here https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g147…Post #30 ....as a factual example of what I am discussing ... and there are many more examples of this happening Like Barbados we are an island state and should have more control over our borders
"WHO says self-isolate for 14 days. UK says 7.WHO says ‘test, test, test’UK says applies only to countries with low & middle incomes. Not ‘appropriate’ in UKWHO says full PPE required inc visors.UK downgraded requirements last week as ‘not necessary’This is why it’s scaryEdited: 8:22 pm, March 28, 2020 "
"Yikes - the opposite of what is happening in Ontario - we are trying to follow WHO plus lessons learned during SARS and MERS -(guess UK considers Canada low to middle income? - maybe they know more than we do)Edited: 9:19 pm, March 28, 2020 "
"""""""guess UK considers Canada low to middle income? - maybe they know more than we do)""""""ASO ...I doubt it just - the UK thinking it knows better than the WHO and has ignored the experience of those countries in the Far East who,in the main, dealt with SARS and MERSFor those interested..Google 'Exercise Cygnus'.

"Come on MDP enough is enough, you’ve made you opinion known and now surely it’s time to let this drop on here, Your comments would be more appropriate maybe on Twitter or a topical FaceBook group than the Barbados Travel Forum!"
"To ChrisGCan I politely suggest that if you don’t wish to hear others views on the politics of this crisis you don’t read a thread that in its title is clearly about politics? It’s a discussion forum. Everyone has an opportunity to respectfully state their view without being told to be quiet.I am extremely interested in how governments around the world are managing or mismanaging the situation and it makes interesting reading here to share stories and views from Barbados, US, Canada and the UK.The politics of health and economics is at the heart of this situation.I’m not on twitter and I’m inclined to come hear to listen to others here who share a love of Barbados as that what links us.Edited: 7:25 am, March 29, 2020 "
"To LandAL... A Like from me !!IMHO.

mdp re #45 - after our Gvt has subsidized anything and everything possible- right or wrong? - good or bad ???- I think we will be lucky to be low Income - Probably No income !! - our debts will out weigh any GDP we may have - so maybe the UK is right and knows more than us (Cans.) OMG! ..LOL ...needs must - but a scary economic future (I remember the days when someone compared the loonie to a northern peso - We Will Survive --- but it will take some really good stick handling (hockey term) to ever get us back on a sound financial footing JMHO
"I'm not sure where this idea that Canada is testing testing testing is coming from. Yes we have been testing more than the US or the UK but that is because we have the test kits, lab capabilities and our gov't determined that Covid testing done according to very strict guidelines was the best way to deal with the pandemic. Other governments chose not to follow that approach. Statistics show that deaths due to covid per capita in Canada is lower than that of either the US or UK. Routine screening for covid in asymptomatic people is not recommended nor is it being done. Why would the British gov't assume that routine screening is for or should be done in countries with low to medium income? Can anyone provide a reference for that concept other than Johnson saying it?"
There is an interesting alternative view on the pandemic written by Peter Hitchens in the Mail on Sunday (UK) - Mail Online (worldwide.)Quoting views of professors who think the world leaders have blown it out of proportion . I'm sure it contradicts MDP's views/experience but it does raise some interesting points. The main one being no-one knows just what is the correct way to handle this virus.
"NC - post #44 quotes WHO as ""test, test, test"" my comment was that Can. was trying to follow WHO guide lines as well as the lessons Can, learned during the SARS crisis when TO required massive efforts to control it"
"When you watch TV in North America and see what is going on in New York... when you see the bodies being stored in refrigerated transport trucks because the morgues are full, when you hear of nurses, doctors, policemen flight attendants dying from it and all being less than 50, how can someone think the world is over reacting. This is happening now and we haven't reached the apex yet. This virus us mutating. Last I read there are three strains so no one knows what it will do down the road. Most gov'ts are trying to slow down the rate of infection so as to not overwhelm the health care systems. These people who think we are over reacting, what is their suggestion of handling the infected? Leave them at home to fend for themselves? Let them die because they were unfortunate enough to catch the virus? Pick a number to see if you get a respirator?I have not read Hitchens' article not sure I'd bother... but maybe when I am seriuosly bored...."
"ASO we are followong WHO guidelines (many as a results of our SARS epidemic). The recommendation is not test, test, test. Where is that coming from? Who is aligning that with wealth? The UK government?Edited: 9:38 am, March 29, 2020 "
N C re #44 - maybe LandAL can tell you?
"WHO advicehttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-51916707…Edited: 9:48 am, March 29, 2020 "
"LandL thank you. He is not saying test,test,test. He is saying increased testing (according to his own guidelines surely) needs to be done. Implying, IMO,that the US and UK needs to get moving. No mention of wealth in what you provided."
"Someone asked for link to who had said we should test test test. That’s what I posted.WHO “OUR MAIN MESSAGE IS TEST TEST TEST”Pretty clear.Edited: 10:20 am, March 29, 2020 "
"Thank you LandAL. He says test every ""suspected case"" (and their contacts) and directs it to all countries with no mention of wealth."
"follow up to #55Dr. ANthony Fauci, leading expert on infectious diseases said to CNN""I would say between 100,000 and 200,000 cases,” he said, correcting himself to say he meant deaths. “We're going to have millions of cases.” But he added “I don't want to be held to that” because the pandemic is “such a moving target.” He is referring to the US alone.How can anyone think the reaction to this pandemic is overblown?"
"""""""Routine screening for covid in asymptomatic people is not recommended nor is it being done.""""""NC .....I have been looking into this and so far have resisted mentioning!!! it as nothing as yet is certain First of all it requires a country to have the capability to engage in a massive testing programme - which is not the case at present in many Western countries On one hand it is VERY useful to know just how many 'carriers' there are ...as it can distort the whole numbers game - which is already very messyIt is particularly useful to know if any exist in the frontline workers - particularly the Social Care workers who can infect older people It was in the news yesterday about a an Italian doctor ...""""""An Italian academic has claimed striking evidence that most people infected with covid-19 show no symptoms but are still able to infect others, which he says has huge implications for testing policy, particularly in hospitals""""""""""""He told La Repubblica, “We’re deciding not to test doctors and nurses if they’re not developing symptoms.

Mdp thanks for that. At this point most (but not all) countries are following WHO protocol. I am sure once enough testing kits are available routine testing will become the norm but because they are not readily available yet the kits are being reserved for health care workers symptomatic patients etc. (certainly not football players). I agree routine testing will give us a better understanding of what is going on especially with 30% of infected people being asymptomatic... but we don't have the kits for that yet.I heard this morning China has developed a test kit that will give results in 15 minutes and can be used in a doctors office. If it is true and if the kits are accurate great!... but does anyone else see the irony?
"John F ...not sure exactly which of his blogs you are referring to ....is it the interview withProfessor Dr Sucharit Bhakdi, an infectious medicine specialist....or another one ...he has many"
"ASO ...re #50 I think it is impossible to comment on the economic future until the crisis over or at least under controlGovernments have be forced to pay out millions /billions to finance a lockdown of much of business so as to facilitate a stay at home social distancing policy. At this stage I guess they have not thought too much about how it will be recoveredI do however believe it is as you say a ""scary economic future"" with recovery taking 10 -20 years ..?????...and I suspect the economies to benefit most when the recovery starts will be those in the Far EastEdited: 2:16 pm, March 29, 2020 "
NC ... yes that would be ironic but not that surprising when you consider the power of the Chinese nation When they decide to 'have a go ' ...they usually succeed and have the scientific might to back up their efforts Even allowing for the different political structure in China they were better prepared that virtually all western countries ...as were other Far Eastern countries with memories of SARS
But they are still selling live animals for slaughter/eating in local markets.
MDP I was referring to his column in today's paper in which he does refer to an interview with the professor. I haven't sought the full interview. Simply because I do not know who is right and who is wrong so would prefer to lean on the side of safety for obvious reasons.
