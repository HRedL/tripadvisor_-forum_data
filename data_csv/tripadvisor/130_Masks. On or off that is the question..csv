"I do believe in this area with an older generation present, masks should be required because we have the younger generation coming to boat, beach and stay in the casinos could spread the virus quickly. California is listed as one of the hot spots."
"At last a fresh topic.Even the Great Satan knows importance of masks:""Liz Cheney posts photo of former VP in face mask and says 'real men wear masks'"""
The mandates have come out that masks will be required in all Nevada business establishments including the casinos.Their will be exceptions when you are actively eating and if you are outdoors walking if you can socially distance. Likely will be required on the river walkThe CDC states that masks can reduce the risk by 50% and does not assure you will still not contract the virus.Casinos probably should have started with this measure as they have done in other states during their reopening
There are 8 yes 8 cases of COVID-19 in Laughlin.
Sorry there are 9 cases now. 8 have recovered and the 9th case is to new to know.
Off. But it should be up to the person.
"Good one PnS. and in Los Angeles they should ""leave it up to the person"" regarding which direction to drive on the freeway."
Very interesting a friend who lives in Laughlin told me he went to ft Mohave smiths and their parking lot was half full but Safeway across he street was packed full. Smiths you must wear masks and Safeway was optional. HmmmmmTo me I would go to smiths and have great parking and no long lines in the store.
"Face Coverings are now mandatory in NV. There are exemptions. As of this morning, the community of Laughlin has 10 positive cases of COVID-19 Keep in mind a majority of visitors are from other states and high percentage of employees in Laughlin are from AZ,"
I keep seeing references to the low case count in Laughlin. They determine the count based on address of record and we are down to just our year round residents. Many of them never go to the casinos and many of those that do share my belief that it is a good idea to stay away until the pandemic is over.I have dealt with opposition to my position but I have some authority. I am an Accountant now but I worked my way through college in a medical building pharmacy. My wife is a retired nurse and was a first responder. She was thinking of coming out of retirement during the pandemic to help to cove the nursing shortage. We decided it was not a good idea as she has one lung and contracting the virus would almost certainly be a death sentence for her.We are in the summer months and have a mix of older and younger visitors. Recent reports indicate that younger people are contracting the virus and passing on to older visitors like we have in Laughlin.I have talked to the visitors who are not thrilled with the mask restriction. Many have said they will not return until this corona issue is overIf you really feel the need to visit Laughlin or Vegas then you should consider the slower midweek days and stay at the less busy casinos. You will also benefit from lower hotel rates during your visit

post 14 reported to TA as a personal attack.goes to the opposition I referenced at reply #9
I never saw 13 or 15.
Masks should be worn inside any business. Outside they should only be worn if you are in crowded areas.
Going to Utah and have been told you donâ€™t need to wear a mask. Can this be true?
"I was in Utah on the 3rd week of June and masks were recommended but not required. I believe it will still be the same but you can probably call the visitor center in St George who could update you during the time you plan to visit. I did go to Moab who did want you to where masks in the businesses and visitor center. They were optional while I was at Arches National parkI am planning to stay in St George rather than Mesquite on my mid August national parks trip starting on in Mid August. My favorite restaurant will be operating on 7/13 and is a buffet. I have established a personal policy not to go to or visit any casino until this is over. This is the mindset of many locals.Most restrictions will not require a mask at the national parks except in the visitor center. As stated on my ""Covid-visiting NV casinos-bad idea"" thread two below that the national parks are a good option. I am not anticipating crowds on the visit which I find desirable when I am hiking.For example, I go to Zion after 2 p.m. on the first day because it can be crowded, camp at Jacob lake and get into the Grand Canyon north rim by 6 a.m., I then get to St George and have a St George day which can include some shopping and maybe a trip out to snow canyon. (state park with a $6 entry fee). The next day I get up early and am at Bryce by 7 a.m.Of course, all trips to plan my main meal at Chuck-A-Rama each day since they change the menu theme every day. I donate $1 to the senior center and get a punch card that gives me a 20% discount each time and a free meal after 10 punches. We have had Thanksgiving dinner there for 5 years in a row. The changing daily theme and all baked breads and deserts are made in house. It beats any place in Nevada and a senior couple can have late lunch there up until 4 p.m. for about $20"
"I realized that I did not mention Thanksgiving dinner was free as they honor the completed card on that day as well.One fine note, my schedule in June changed and I booked a room for one night at the motel studio 6 on Redlands parkway. It came with full refrigerator and kitchen unit, two queen beds and was $49 on the midweekI am staying there on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday on the national parks trip that the total 3 day bill will be $168"
With the high number of Covid cases in Arizona coming across the border into Nevada they should make masks compulsory whenever you leave your house or car.

My apologies CmasiaI was just trying to answer the question if masks should be worn or not. Is my opinion not wanted? I am confused. This forum does not have many members and I was just trying to be a part of it. However your message was loud and clear.

I miss Laughlin a lot. I guess I donâ€™t have a choice now that their are no flights going there. Loved sitting at the bar at Riverside or Aquarius. Playing VP while drinking a beer and watching the river. So relaxing and peaceful. Some day soon I hope.
"Just got back from a 6 night stay (sorry Laughlin Traveler, didn't get a chance to reply back to you to set up a time to meet you). Okay here is my take: You just can't ignore the fact that positive cases are spiking. Having said that I'd say 99% of the people were wearing masks in the casinos. Those that weren't were smoking. People who were drinking would drop their mask, take a drink and raise their mask back up. Those that were smoking kept the mask down the whole time. But masks do not prevent you from getting the virus completely. Every time you touch something then touch your mask you are at risk. This is not an argument for or against, just how it is. I do believe Laughlin Traveler was correct that they opened up too soon. The numbers just don't lie. I also believe him that the number of positive cases in Laughlin don't paint an accurate picture because the vast majority of cases are from visitors who take the virus to their state after getting it in Laughlin. Just like everybody else, I hated wearing the mask, I hated that all the entertainment was shut down, I hated that restaurants had limited seating - but this is just how it is. I'm not here to support or vilify Laughlin Traveler but you just can't disagree with the numbers; numbers that he said will happen. Viva Laughlin!!"
"On.Just my humble opinion.Stay safe,Hunt"
"Yes, ON.In Nevada it's a state requirement.Only to be taken off when sitting at a restaurant table, eating and drinking.This thread was started before ON became mandatory."
"Laughlin or Bust,Sorry we did not hook up but thank you for your support on this issue and your valued and CONSTRUCTIVE input unlike others that have replied.I have been researching this mask issue a little more. It is estimated that a human being breathes about 20,000 times in 24 hours. It stands to reason to use a mask for the short interval when going to a store or getting goods and services you need. We need to address the long term impact of wearing a mask for a long duration such as sitting in a casino and the impact of limiting air intake for long periods of time.Also, the mask is only 50% effective and is not really to protect the person wearing it. It is designed so that person does not spread the virus.As you pointed out, the failure to keep masks dawned goes back to my post that there are reckless visitors who do not show regard for the safest measures.I am hoping your supporting reply makes the California visitor consider their options or at least visiting on non peak mid week days if they really feel they just have to visit the casinos"
"I am in Utah right now. There are no requirements for masks. As I go to the stores, restaurants and any other place almost no one wears a mask. So anyone thinking of vacationing any where in Utah that is concerned about people wearing masks might rethink it and go somewhere else. You might just want to stay home and lock yourselves down in your home."
"I frequent Utah and believe they will take the steps appropriately as needed for the prevention of the COVID.Remember the main LDS faith and the average resident in Utah are healthier and are usually do not drink or smoke.There low numbers are due to the awareness of Utah residents and their awareness of others in conjunction with their clean living and lifestyle.I suggest that you enjoy Utah and bring a mask for your own feeling of security.As stated above, Moab and the visitor centers in the park required masks but the parks themselves made the masks optional as it is easy to socially distance yourself on the park trails and trail heads."
"I also want to add that I was in Utah in June.I did eat at the Golden Corral since Chuck A Rama closed until their first decision to reopen on 7/13. The employees served up the meals and told us that by 7/13 that they may go to having customers handle the togs with disposable gloves.The policy was that masks were recommended but not required except as on a business by business policy to mandate them. All Costco stores are requiring masks,The masks do more to stop the spread rather than prevent the spread of the virus.I think it would be important that the visitor wear them more than the locals since the transmission would likely come from the visitors. Masks still a good idea if you are in any crowded enclosed area."
The percentage of Mormons in Utah as of today is 35%. This leaves 65 percent are not. I was told by a friend who has lived in Bountiful all her adult life and she has said on many occasions that most are not of the Mormon faith now. Like I said most everyone I saw are not wearing masks. I have brought all my masks just in case. I am in a small town unlike St. George so my chances of getting the virus Is much less.
"I am sure that St George and Utah will take the required steps to assure safety of all.The Utah Governor has made good decisions in the past and I am certain he will do what is required now.Really Please as visitor probably should mask up especially in areas where there is a crowd.Even the non LDS residents of Utah for the most part embrace the no smoking or drinking healthy lifestyle.I would like to remind you that the state slogan for Utah is ""Life Elevated""I know that I am looking forward to my Utah trip in August to have a safe vacation trip that will include staying 3 nights in St George.However, I will not consider going tot a Nevada casino until the corona crisis is over."

Someone's post got deleted before I saw it.I just had a conference with my tax client who is also the security manager at one of the casinos who shared the new Goveernor mandate with me.All bars in the casinos will be closed including you not even playing the video poker machines. Players will still be able to order drinks while playing the machines.The mask enforcement will include masks on any part of the casino property. This will include the parking lots and anywhere on the Riverwalk. So much for fresh air breaks.

post #39 from Cmasia has been reported as a personal attack again to TA.
"In rebuttal to Cmasia.I am well aware what was in the news but reported first hand from the casino management in Laughlin.My ""Laughlin casinos disregarding reopening requirements"" thread led me to believe that a first hand report from the Laugnlin casinos management plan would be in order.It is just Cmasia failed attempt to discredit. Try to ingore him as you see the posts."
"Analysis of Post 41 - and it's nothing personal! He said:""I am well aware what was in the news but reported first hand from the casino management in Laughlin.""So, LT knew the Governor's new directives, but needed a week to ensure us casino management in Laughlin was following those directives.As I said, what would we do without our intrepid traveler?Then he said, ""My ""Laughlin casinos disregarding reopening requirements"" thread led me to believe that a first hand report from the Laughlin casinos management plan would be in order.""Anyone with half a brain, and access to the internet, knows every ""bar"" closed at exactly 11:59PM on July 10, per the Governor's directive.Yet our intrepid traveler needed a look see trip just to reassure us all the casinos were not trying to sneak one past the state of Nevada. At the expense of their licenses, permanently.I hope Don Laughlin calls L T directly and thanks him for saving the city by making a ""first hand report"" on Trip Advisor.What would we do without him?"
"Cmasia,I want to point out the security manager is a client of mine and spent time in my office discussing the issues since I was so visible with my posts. He knew that I would not go to the casinos at this time. I am trying to assure that the management at the casinos will be complying with the requirements this time and non compliance from the visitors will not be tolerated. The casinos now know the Governor is serious and will shut down the casinos completely again if the mandate is not properly carried out.I found it interesting that I received a email from Station casinos that they were offering locals a stay-cation promotion with lower hotel rates and no resort fee.It shows that I am not the only local who plans to stay away from the casinos until this is over regardless of the restrictions."
I have found in the last few days it is not that bad wearing masks at least for me. As soon as I get outside I pull it down. Funny thing though I find myself now forgetting to take it off. I guess I am getting use to it.
