"ReviewerMaryland, That is funny! Thanks for the laugh!"
"ReviewerMaryland,A much needed moment of humor. Thank you."
Watch out for fake news!!!!! Stick to the truths!!!!
Okay folks - no need to be rude. The redundancy is sounding so joan. It’s all an opinion without factual backup.
"""The redundancy is sounding so joan.""Talk about being rude. Maybe take your own advice."
"Joan,Thank you for all you’ve done on the forums during this hard time."
ReviewerMaryland1: l Love It - Too Funny!
"ReviewerMaryland1: ‘I SECOND THAT EMOTION’. JoanS speaks truth to power and she gives ‘sound advice’ to would be travellers. She tries her best to leave ‘politics’ out of this pandemic, but she understands that at a time like this ‘all politics is local’ and people feel secure knowing she lives in Cancun and is an eye witness to what is happening on the ground! To live it is to know it as they say!"
"Thank you, ReviewerMaryland1 and Arlene. I appreciate the support."
Agreed. Nice work Joan
Joan is awesome!
"Thank you, bb001abc and Henry F."
I always look forward to Joan’s posts. They are reasonable and sound! Thanks Joan for taking so much time to respond to people.
Yes Joan. Nice work. I love seeing the same post which was posted by a previous member. Then Posted on all other posts. Start a new one with the latest and greatest.
"Joan, Thank you.The rest of us: let’s not feed the trolls."
"Zeeka,Not everyone who comes to this forum reads every thread. Even regular posters these days seem to just read a few. So, to make sure the info is out there and available to everyone e no matter what threads they're choosing to read I post info in more than one thread If I think it's something important. If you don't like it then kindly skip over it. As for posting something others already did then again skip over it. In fact, skip over all my posts if you like. There's quite a few duplicate posts on here by many people. Again for the reason that not everyone read a all the threads. And I think they will likely continue until this situation changes. Bottom line is I'm trying to helpful but sometimes I don't have time to read through every post myself before posting what I think is helpful and useful information. So I'm not always aware If it has already been posted. If you don't appreciate that or find it annoying then so be it. But I have absolutely NEVER been rude to you and fail to see why you felt it necessary to make the comment that started this chain of thought. I have treated you with nothing but respect yet you feel it's okay to use my name as an adjective. I don't understand that way of thinking and never will."
Joan - thx for the info. Ever needs to get Home- ASAP. I am more worried about the first time travelers etc. There’s no reason to get snipity :-)I it’s great that fellow travelers have up to date news. Make it the TOP!!No redundancy. We need food here and our truckers need food and rest.
"Zeeka, I saw a good piece on the news (USnews) about how the government is trying to help the truckers and how truck stops have been designated essential so that the needs of the truckers can be met. They are hoping invaluable and need to be taken care of So they can do their job."

"Isn't there a shortage of masks?This is according to WHO:""If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection.Wear a mask if you are coughing or sneezing.Masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.If you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly.""https://tinyurl.com/qpzvx28Edited: 3:43 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"JoanS: Just read your post today. You continue to do a great job of informing travelers of the ‘pros and cons’ of traveling to Cancun during this World Pandemic of Coronavirus. So, keep up the good work, and as ‘Live From New York it’s Saturday Night’ would say, don’t worry about the ‘DEBBIE DOWNERS’ they will always be with us!!"
"That's not always easy, Arlene. I've always thought myself a nice and helpful person (and I'll still try to be) but I'd be lying if I said it's not hard to constantly see my name dragged through the mud. I've commented to a few of you that I don't understand why some people here are so mean and hateful when the Isla Mujeres and Cozumel forums (where I also post) are much friendlier and gracious to each other in general than the people here.My boyfriend read some of the comments and thinks I should just say adios to the whole thing. But I'm going to put my faith in the hope that people here are just reacting to what is going on in the world today and that when it's over things will get back to normal.And I will add that the TA moderators have been very supportive and I appreciate it greatly. I appreciate all the support on here.Edited: 6:05 pm, March 21, 2020 "

"WorldTraveler, I can understand your wish to protect yourself in a crowded situation, however everyone must also understand that those in primary need of protection do not have enough to do so. My son who is a doctor saw a patient who ended up testing positive for coronavirus and he was not wearing protective gear. His gf is a nurse and is given one mask at the start of a 12 hour shift and told to make do. Those masks are supposed to be changed frequently and that is not happening. If our healhcare workers cannot be protected they will get sick or have to isolate and then we will be in an even worse situation than we are now.I looked out my window yesterday and saw someone wearing a mask while walking their dog. No one else about. I had to stop myself from screaming at them to wise up and leave the masks for the primary line."

"Same here in Canada, they knew this was going to get worse and had been warned by the disease centre but actually donated a lot of supplies overseas. They should have ramped up production at the same time for our own medical use. A number of manufacturers here have retooled their machines to make ventilators and they are in talks re other ppe equipment. Hopefully it gets done fast."
Just an FYI - people are making masks. For themselves and others. Down here there is a shortage of elastic and various materials.
