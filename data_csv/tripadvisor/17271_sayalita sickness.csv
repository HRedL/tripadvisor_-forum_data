"We are planning on traveling to Sayalita on Thursday, April 11th for a wedding. Are people still getting sick there even if they do not go into the water and even though they are taking extreme precautions??"
Yes! It’s airborne! We took all precautions and 6/6 got sick as did everyone we spoke to around us! It’s horrible. I used to love sayulita but I will not be back! We were there March 25- April 1.
We were there from March 24-April 3. We took many precautions . All 10 of us got sick. A number of us are still not feeling well.
"Go to the Sayulita Forum. There are probably 6,000,000 (+/-) current threads on this very topic."
Thank you for your post!

"We were in Sayulita March 24-30, 2019. My husband and I are both physicians and took all precautions to prevent getting sick. 4/4 of us got extremely sick. They dump sewage into their public beach. Avoiding the Norovirus is impossible."
Yes
"I just had 7 friends come down for a week in Sayulita. None out of the 7 got norovirus and only 1 was feeling a little ill for one day but was better the next day. I am not saying that something is not going around and that people are not getting sick but not EVERYONE is getting sick. They ate out at different restaurants, drank drinks with ice, went to the beach, swam ect. They were staying in the South end of town and walked around every day. They did take activated charcoal tablets every day, used hand sanitizer and brought bleach wipes to wipe down tables, counters ect. When we ate at Don Pedros one night they had hand sanitizer at the entrance and were wiping all tables and surfaces with bleach wipes. I know some people are getting sick but just wanted to put out there that not every person that visits Sayulita is getting it."

#5 You posted attraction review of sayulita beach with only average and poor reviews checked off. Not really the most honest thing to do. Why not post with all reviews?
Never checked off Anything.Wow.https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g445056…5 Years too Late.
"Interesting, because when you click the link you posted it only shows average and poor reviews and not the excellent and good ones. I'm sure it was an honest mistake."
"i clicked on joleen's link and it has all of them....the truth is that lately there weren't too many good ones , reaching for excellence was never the intention of people in sayulita...just the excellent nature around has put a good light in an otherwise pure greed that has been happening there..."
When you follow the link you have to scroll down and click the check button on Excellent and Very Good to get all of the reviews shown and not just the average and poor ones. There are some very good recent reviews of the beach if you actually look at it properly.
stormsam...still wrong...you're full of Enterococcus faecalis...
