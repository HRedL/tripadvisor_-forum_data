I wonder till date how many corona caes in paris and what web site i should monitor to know the daily number of infected people in parsi
This is the government information on the number of cases in France. They do not define the clusters.https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus
"Three days ago there were 21 in Paris, but in the same article they say 2 deputés. There are now 5 deputés. leparisien.fr/paris-75/covid-19-30-nouveaux-…https://www.bfmtv.com/politique/coronavirus-…"
"So there are maybe 21 cases in a city of 2.1 million, an infection rate of 0.00001%. If that alarms you, don't think of trying to cross a road."
"It's an easy enough question to answer on your own by googling the phrase ""coronavirus paris""."
"Your maths is incorrect. 21/2100000 is 0.00001 but when expressed as a percentage it must be multiplied by 100. So your figure should be .001%.In any case it's still a very small percentage so your point still stands, though that number may grow considerably larger before a peak is reached."
"@French_Mystique , if i had the info from google ,definetly i will not as it here , but all my search lead to number of infection in France and some others numbers in Ile de france which paris is a part of it , even in frensh language , locals frensh news nothing about paris itself affection percentageEdited: 5:43 am, March 11, 2020 "
I would also like to know where I can follow specifically Paris’ situation. Most of the cases seems to be outside Paris so far.
Apparently it is an easy question that can't be answered easily.From that official santé website I think I glanced 334 cases for Île-de-France as of today. I guess that could be comparable to the Navigo zones.That population number is 12.21 million people.
ATF - it can be answered easily. 44https:/…amp
"Does that link show 2 separate health agencies reports for the Paris region, one says 440 cases and one says 334 cases? Or am I reading that incorrectly?I guess France finally received more test kits. How long ago did they only have 400 kits for the country.Edited: 2:02 pm, March 11, 2020 "

Yes. Two different agencies reporting different numbers on different days. I leave to you to sniff out how the IdF numbers went down from the 10th to the 11th.
"440 with 44 Paris or 334 with 33.4 cases using bad algebra of course so it appears in the beginning we used to know which arrondissement and how many, 1 teacher, a guy with a cough at a police station, a kid makes 3 but now 44 probably 100 tomorrow, I guess each case is no longer important, forest for the trees: https:/…en___Meanwhile, blue skin people are immune, the French Smurf party is the place to be, or did 3,500 people not get the memo: https://news.yahoo.com/french-mayor-defends-…"
"You can view the coronavirus statistics by country here:https:/…countries(I know you asked for Paris, but giving you what I keep reviewing.)As of today, France has 2,281 cases (497 new cases in the past 24 hours). There have been 48 reported deaths.It appears Italy is seeing the fastest growth rate.Story here: https://www.thelocal.fr/20200305/latest-numb…Edited: 4:06 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"@David is it really safer in the US. The issue in the US is a lack of testing. Until recently there were just over 500 cases in the US with approximately 3500 tested, which is certainly underreporting things. There are reliable estimates that put the number of cases in New York City at over 1000 which I think is quite reasonable. Is travelling to France more of a risk than staying home? Not questioning your decision, just thinking out loud."

I don't think we need another site for this. There are already plenty. You are late to the party.
"Nice job Nelu, but there are a number of sources now available."
My godmothers husband is hospitalized with Covid - he is 79 but has always been in good health and he and my godmother still live every independent lives still in their place in the 8 Th .

I'm really sorry to hear that Joan. I hope he will be okay.
"Sussex me too... they are the last of my family left in Paris now( although a godmother does not mean they are blood.. but she is, as my father and her shared same grandmother , so I think that makes me some sort of 2 or removed cousin lol ) and they have always been so kind to me."
I wish them a safe and speedy recovery.....a very high percentage of people do recover.
Yes today we learned my godmothers husband has left the hospital to continue to recover at home ! He was in for More than two weeks ! A long recovery period is anticipated but he has won the main battle ! And at his great age too !
Oh isn't that lovely news? Heartening. Thanks for telling us Joan.
"Thank you Littlelambsussex , we really anticipated the worst as he is quite elderly ( although otherwise very healthy ) ."
"""A long recovery period is anticipated but he has won the main battle ! And at his great age too !""Glad to hear he is doing better now and recovering!"
"Joan, I wish them well and I hope their conditions ameliorate quickly. Let us hope the Gilead’s experimental drug “Remdesivir” helps the quest in discovering the Holy Grail remedy."
AMEN to the above posts - re Joan's god-family improvement and the work with Remdesivir. Wishing everyone a safe and healthy May Day.
"Joan - and her relative - have great news. But just in case we are anticipating the benefits of Remdesivir in satisfying the eager traveller's ambitions - so far, the identified benefits are to reduce 15 days spent recovering to 11. It is not a cure. It lessens time to recovery which means (I am speculating here) less time in ICU, less risk of needing ventilation and so less risk of adverse affects of that extreme procedure. So it seems Remdesiver is a bit like paracetamol for the flu - reduces the impact, alllows the body's own resistance to be more effective, and so offers ""a way out"" for those with the capacity to resist the infection. It is not Tamiflu - which has to be administered in any case at the earliest signs of infection - and actually stops the influenza virus from growing, post infection. Like Tamiflu, Remdesivir is not a vaccine. That, like Christmas, is yet to come.To the extent that travellers are hoping for Remdesiver to provide a quick and easy return to ""business as normal"", my guess is that there are many, many miles to go before we sleep (in a foreign bed) - apologies to Robert Frost."
