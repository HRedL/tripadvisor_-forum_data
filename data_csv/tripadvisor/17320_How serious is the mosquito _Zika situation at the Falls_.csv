"We will be there 8-10 March 2016. Have been reading newspapers on the Zika epidemic. March is end of summer, early fall. Would the weather be cooler hence less mosquitoes?"
"March 8 -10 is summer, and weather forecasts indicate that the temperatures will be high.accuweather.com/es/â€¦9979Zica is not a big issue (at least, for the time being). Only a handful of cases in the whole country.The same mosquito that transmits the zica virus also carries dengue fever, which is the main sanitary issue at Iguazu right now.DO use mosquito repellent at all times and you will be fine."
