"Do you check for bed bugs? Since there is an epidemic of them in Ohio, what do you do to make sure your customers don't get them?"
"I have stayed in Berlin Ohio, scores of times. the last time I was going to stay at zinks inn I e-mailed them to see what the were doing to prevent BBs. They would not answer my mail, So I didn`t stay . Many of the hotels still put bed spreads on there beds, This means it would be impossible to prevent BBs. If they refuse to answer questions. That means they are doing nothing. I use to stay in Amish country about once a month. I wont be anymore."
