"My spouse and I and 2 grandkids (14,15) will be flying out of Atlanta to Anchorage July 22. We are from Southwest GA and there are not quick result labs near us. Suggestions please about places that we could be tested near Atlanta area the day before. Will places take appointments? Thanks, Lee from SW GA"
"Have you checked walgreens? ""Covid-19 Testing & Locations | Walgreens"" https:/â€¦testing"
Yes. It is 3-5 day turnaround and I need 72 hours....... that's the problem. Looking for reliable place near Atlanta.
Have you thought to ask on the Atlanta forum? More people there would be familiar with Atlanta than on this forum.
"Walgreens in Alpharetta or the Fulton County board of health drive up center on north point parkway is the best bet.However walgreens will not test under the age of 18, not sure about the board of health.I luckily live in Alpharetta (GA) and it seems all the testing sites are in my town for some reason...."
Thank you!
"We had the same quandary last week as we looked for rapid testing appointments this week in the ATL area to coincide with our Friday flight. We ended up using Emory/St Joes. Last week about a 20 minute hold to speak with a screening nurse, got set up for an appointment yesterday morning, results back this morning, flight leaves Friday morning so it worked out. Our son, who is not going on this trip with us, got tested at CVS Thursday and does not have his results back yet."
"Concert, I hadnt come across Emory in my research! Can you tell me (fellow ATLien) more about the process? was it free? what number did you call? was it a drive up site? did you have to wait long? results were fast! I want to do all possible to make sure I get mine done and back within the 72 hours (ideally less)"
678-843-7001Reception answers then puts you in a phone que for a screening nurse - about 20 mins last weekWe went to the Emory Clinton street campus yesterday and all very orderly and quick.They send an email to sign up for their health portal and results are on there in 24-48 hours.You drive up to check in then park and go in. Results were back in 28 hours.
Did the offer any other campus locations other than down town.. man I hate downtown.
"It was actually North Druid Hills area so not downtown, easy commute.. They did reference a drive through location but did not have any spots yesterday."
