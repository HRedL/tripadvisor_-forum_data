"30 years ago I had to decide to stay at Sahara, a perfectly nice hotel, or Tropicana, one of the very best resorts in Las Vegas. In the end I paid more to stay at Tropicana, mostly because my wife loved the pool there.It would NEVER had occurred to us, or anyone we knew, to stay at Sahara and try and use the pool at Tropicana. People just didn't do that then. They built this great pool hoping that people like us would choose to stay at their hotel instead of one of the cheaper options. And we all understood that.Every day or two on this board there is a post asking if they can stay at an economy hotel and use the better pools at the better hotels.Las Vegas has always been about tipping and gambling, and the hosts would always take care of those that played enough. And the hotels were generous in handing out some freebies. But if we booked a Garden Room at Trop, or a Manor Room at Circus Circus that's what we expected to get. We didn't ASK to be upgraded to a Tower Room. Comps have always existed, and it wasn't unusual for someone to walk up to a table and offer a buffet or dinner comp if you had been playing for a while. And they were appreciated. More because of the fact that the casino recognized you as a good customer and appreciated your play, than for the value of the comp itself.Now comps are EXPECTED. And many people will switch casinos in a minute if the point formula changes, or they no longer get the same comps as in the past. What's in it for me!I don't think Las Vegas has changed as much as the people who go there. JMO"
"Good points! I think it's partly because the idea of a comp, or upgrade, or any other freebie is part of the Fantasyland that is Las Vegas.Where else is this even possible? I can imagine going into a fancy hotel in any other city and saying to the desk person ""I know I reserved the standard steerage room, but could you maybe put me in the Presidential Tower? I'll give you $20!"""
"Wish there was a ""like"" button for this post. It's not just Vegas sadly, it's rampant everywhere. The sense of entitlement."
Not just in Vegas. Look at any forum and somewhere you'll find someone asking how to get a free upgrade. And being upset if they don't get one.
That's the most 'common sense' post I've read in years.SPOT ON!CheersDavy !!!
You can just extrapolate this and say the world has changed in general - people have this giant sense of self-entitlement now and expect to be given everything they ask for. I totally agree with everything you've said. You could say that working in customer service has made me a little bitter though :)
"I'm more concerned about comps now that rack rates and dining is so much more expensive and as my tastes have changed. It's hard to go back to the bed and tub/shower and 20 inch tube TV places after having sampled some of the nicer properties. But I've never asked, nor expected to be upgraded to a suite for example, or tried to use amenities at one property while staying at a cheaper one. For one thing, if I've been at the pool all day, the last thing I want to do is climb in a bus or cab or even my own car, or walk up the strip back to my room to shower and change. As I do in any city whether paying full freight or not, I do ask for a high floor and as nice a view as I can get in my category. It's a feature I've always appreciated."
agree with everything you said. I contribute the epidemic to the Kartrashians.
"Jeesh KTINCA - how long ago was that ? Didn't they tear down the Sahara back in the 60's ?Seriously, great assessment. Having pit bosses dole out comps was not always fair but it was usually close and if you wanted more you could ask and there was a person who could say yes or no. With corporate style processes, we've been taught to try to beat them at their game by squeezing out extras.So I certainly agree that (we) the visitors have changed, but the corporations are culpable."
"Do understand what your saying, but being one like yourself that was there 30 years ago. (Did I say that) I think we also got more bang for the buck. We of course were not paying $l000.00 from the east coast to fly there. We were not paying 200 -300 a room. We were treated like kings and queens. The corporate structure didn't have it's greedy hands in the till. People have not changed, it's the way Las Vegas has been set up by the major Corps. There the ones that changed it. There the ones that say how much to gamble and we will then treat you like your humane. No, it's not the average person: It's the way the greedy corps have taught them to be. Years ago, I did not even know what the word upgrade meant. Who taught us that word. They did... They have told us how to act, spend, and what to expect. Nothing else matters but how much they are going to make off you. People might just be getting smarter. There on to them and will take whatever they are willing to give away. But in all reality, that is what they tell us we have basically earned. Not the people, Not the visitor, it's how we have been told to act. Did you ever envision years ago paying $200 to $300 for a show ticket. Did you ever think a cup of coffee was going to be $8.00.. A bottle of water $2.00 - $3.00. The visitor has not changed the Corps have Game Changed."
I think with the internet now we have a lot more things to share with other people so now people visiting want to see everything
"Well my expectation is old school then. I gamble about $200 a day for 3 weeks and don't expect anything other than a drink now and then. I don't expect rooms or hosts or anything else and frankly don't want to be that 'Connected' to a casino. I will only ever expect to use pools in the resorts where I am staying. The beauty of Vegas is that it caters for any budget and those that think it is an elite place or for those of a certain 'class' or financial position are very very mistaken. If you think you are owed something by the casinos then you are wrong. No other destination (to my mind) operates quite like Vegas. There is an understanding between casino and customers. Don't think you are worth their while coz you put a few dollars their way over the tables or in the slots. You know what you are doing. You chose to gamble. The enticements came when the strip was trying to build a market away from Downtown and Downtown gave comps to compete with neighbours. Now, if you think 'Well I shall take my business elsewhere' then the reaction would probably be 'Well please feel free to do that'.The only people the casinos worry about keeping are those that are flown in and given suites and a host. They are well looked after, the rest of us should be grateful for drinks for the cost of a tip and a free key fob or deck of cards for joining what amount to a mailing list."
"Ktinca, and JupiterJoe, we are all about the same age and remember Vegas they way it was before the corperations took over. We like many others miss the the Las Vegas of the eighties, early ninties, and we can't get it back.We leave Sunday after next and will post a TR, but that may be our last trip to Vegas for a few years."
"I think the entitlements are long gone: Gone a few years ago. They tell you what you can get (players desk) and what the entitlement is, if you have gambled your fare share. That is the total bottom line. Right now there is no black and white. So the question is the Visitor or Las Vegas.. The visitor that has not visited in 20 or 10 years might feel nostalgic in thinking they are entitled but they are basically set straight very quick.. It's just all business now. Your a number and a $ sign. Don't ever think different."
Ship 80 and 90's. I was there for Elvis. Late 60's and 70's. That was great. Wow what a town. I do think Katinca asked a different question. Don't want to ruin his thread... Just for my two cents. I LOVED it then. I still LOVE it now.
"Everything changes, not just Vegas and not just Vegas visitors. I've been going to Vegas for many decades, when people talk about ""old school"" and refer to 30 years ago I realize they don't have a good frame of reference. 1980 is not old school.While ktinca may not have thought about asking for upgrades, I guarantee you others did. Cash was king and tipping for rooms, seats in restaurants (the leather booths at The Riv were prime geography and seats at shows was common and expected. No Ticketmaster telling us an exact seat - an actual usher in a TUX took you to your seat. A friendly handshake made that a seat in the front. This is a change not brought on by the visitors but by Vegas and all other destinations which have, as they should, change with the times. Technology has brought on many changes.I wonder how many people who want ""old school"" Vegas back, lament the corporations being in control would really want to have to play by the rules of the past - even the near past which ktinca references. They wouldn't want to dress up nightly (men in suits!), tip cash for what they have become accustomed to receiving for free, and the comps while some may THINK were easier were not always as generous. Sure, you got a meal from the pit, the low-mid range gambler does much better with the current system.Visitors have changed and so have the way businesses handle those visitors. It's not a more or less situation - it's life, happens everywhere."
"Excellent post, and imho very true.I cannot believe people still complain about room costs, $150.00/night will get you some very nice rooms in 4-5 star properties, a Super 8 in Calgary will cost you $90-$100 a night.Everybody wants everything handed to them, they want free stuff and don't want to pay for it, I believe in the motto work hard but play harder.Wish I could have seen Vegas in the Mafia run days, I think I am the very few that take pride and wear a suit jacket at night when I go to a nice resturant or show.It doesn't take much effort to try and show some class.Again great post."
"Ktinca, I agree 100%! Everyone thinks they're entitled to everything all the time!"
The thing that changed with the corporations was that every part of a property's operations have to turn a profit. As I understand it they used to expect to lose on drinks/food/room and make the profit on tables and slots. Thats why we are all paying 7 dollars for a beer and 15 for a cocktail. At those prices people will look for anything for free.Edited: 8 years ago 
""" I cannot believe people still complain about room costs, $150.00/night will get you some very nice rooms in 4-5 star properties, a Super 8 in Calgary will cost you $90-$100 a night.""I agree with you on this one totally CalgaryVegasAce!Seriously, you can't get those kind of prices for hotels like that anywhere else but Vegas, and yet some people will still complain about it? Baffles me too......."
"Good post. I'm 35 so I can't quite give an opinion of the difference from then and now. My first time in Vegas was in 2004. I can say that I have never been one to expect anything I haven't earned or paid for. I don't walk around with any sense of entitlement. I was raised better than that. When you don't grow up with a lot, you appreciate what you have. I will say that I do notice that behavior a lot more now that I'm older. More so with the younger generation. Not all but quite a few."
"Just my two cents...I have never gambled for comps...I have on occasion received room upgrades with the sandwich trick, I really do not have a sense of entitlement.That being said it irks me when the mega corps impose resort fees or make changes to black jack...just my opinion...Please don t rain down on me your thoughts about how stupid I am because I can t do basic math...Viva las vegas"
"People have mainly just gotten smarter and more savvy. Plus times are tough. People would still like to take a vacation without going bankrupt. Calling people entitled for wanting to get the most bang for their buck is presumptous and elitist, imho.Buying or asking about resort passes, something common around the world, is not some kind of sin."
"JJ: Actually when I started going to Vegas, around 1970, I drove (gas was 39 cents a gallon) It cost more to fly to Vegas then than it does now. Regular people didn't fly yet, only businessmen or the wealthy flew anywhere. The only time truck drivers or grocery clerks flew in those days was if some relative across the country was sick and on deaths door. And if you remember the airlines had special fares for those flying home for a funeral, so we could afford it.You think Vegas rooms are expensive now? In 1981 when I made that decision between Sahara and Trop I paid $85 a night to stay at the Tropicana Resort and Country Club. Of course it was a great hotel then, I wouldn't pay $85 a night now. But then that was like Four Seasons money now. Las Vegas hotel rates have always been expensive during good times, it's only during bad times (such as we just had) that the rates go way down. Most of the ""golden days"" that people think of in Las Vegas when prices are really low, were the times when Vegas was struggling to keep afloat, and in fact many casinos changed hands or went bankrupt. And the late 80's and 90's were one of these down periods. I realize that people haven't just changed in their attitudes and expectaions abou Las Vegas, and it affects every aspect of our society. But I don't read political or economic forums every day. I read the Las Vegas forum. So this is where I notice how much things have changed."
"Interesting thread. I'm relatively new to Vegas (well, over 21 anyway...2 visits over the past 2 years and my next trip in 2 days). In my last 2 trips I was THRILLED at how cheap I could get a room compared to anywhere else I've been. I was even more thrilled at getting a couple of my meals comped and about $20 back in free slot play. For my trip in 2 days, I'm staying in my first comped room (a suite, no less) and I am beyond excited, and even somewhat afraid they're going to tell me it was all a mistake and it's not free after all. LOL I know I ""earned"" those comps with my gambling, but I look at playing slots as entertainment. The comps truly are a bonus for me. All of that aside, I do see a lot of ""entitlement"" in many posts here and elsewhere and it does bother me a bit. I think too many attitudes like that could down the road result in a slowing down of the comps being offered. All that aside, I think everyone should try to remember that any comps or reduced rates on rooms are a bonus to the whole Vegas experience. I know it is for me. :-)"
"Katinca: I do think people flew in the 1970's. I know at that exact time, I was flying all over and into Vegas of course. Maybe you meant from Ca. they didn't just pick up and fly there. From the east coast, we were flying and I mean on an aircraft besides everything else.The last economic report for the last quarter was abysmal that is for CET and MGM. Not much has changed except visitation is up, but there far from making any money. Hence: Pool thread: charging for you to sit down. Next will be charging to go in the pool. I stand by my statement: We have not changed, there the ones making all the rules. We just follow. We just start paying more."
"Dancemon: That has nothing to do with it. Entitlement slowing down of comps. If you read the new structuring of M-Life: It's just money in and comps out. Understand, they are not giving you anything that you have not given yourself. It's basic business and that is how they are running it. You might get a random marketing comp to a hotel that you have not stayed at in a while. That is just the bait. You are clocked from the minute you sign in. So start playing."
"It wasn't really that long ago that comps were discretionary with the host. It's better business to make it more uniform I guess so the hotel can keep track of whether the comps given are ""earned"" and balance the books properly. I think a lot of people who might not have had the nerve or the knowledge to ask for comps under the old host system take advantage of the marketing. I know that's true with me. I had no idea that my level of play might earn me a comped room or meal. It wasn't until a friend introduced me to her host that I realized the value I could get from them. Now the casino shoves them in your face. There's a psychological pressure on the gambler to sustain a level, because people don't like to lose status, literally or figuratively. 15 years ago, you might be able to drop in to the casino, play a few bucks and get your host to buy your dinner for 4 if you had a reasonable history there. Now you're in danger of lowering your ADT with such behavior.  I assume in the long run, it is more profitable for the casino to let the players in on what they need to do to get and sustain comps. Gamblers shouldn't, but they do at least play with an awareness of rewards, if not actively ""chase comps."""
"ADT is the game. Folks, that is average daily theoretical LOSS! And after the family friendly era failed the club era ensued and Vegas is making lots of money from young folks willing to pay for bottle service and such. So I kind of agree with Ktinca that the visitor has changed but really it is more about what corporations have done to court the most money from the middle classes to supplement what they get from the whales. That is what changes."
Great post! Well put.
"Very good post ktinca but like others have posted its happening everywhere,people want more for nothing."
"I understand what you're saying ktinca and I'm certain there's an element of truth in it, but I still think you're oversimplifying. The casinos have changed vastly in the last 10 years, let alone the last 30. The corporate takeover of the industry drastically changed the comp game. Then you have the rise of the Internet (places like this forum) which let the average joe on his first trip to Vegas learn that even he can get some comps. Often to the uninitiated comps are something that are given to high-rollers and bigshots, rightly or wrongly, a lot of people desire to feel like that even if they aren't. Going along with the idea of more information, if you know others are getting comps for their play are you wrong to want them too? If I knew nothing about comps and started laying $500 a hand at BJ for several hours and got nothing for it, I probably wouldn't care. But knowing the system wouldn't I have a natural expectation to get something?While I'll readily admit all my information about ""the old Vegas"" is second hand I still thoroughly believe that, along with the rest of the world, Vegas has changed just as much as it's visitors."
"kt, haven't read hardly any of the responses. As one who was likewise there, done that, your post is so spot on.Only in Vegas does the ""I'm owed, give me something for nothing"" mentality come so to the forefront.Treat the visit like any other anywhere and the unique benefits will thereafter be seen in their proper perspective.Oh, and it is a town built on gambling! And don't forget to tip."
"Great post. Enjoying all the responses, too. I have only been going to Vegas since 1997, so don't have a lot of experience with the ""old Vegas"". But I do enjoy (and appreciate) comps that I receive (rooms, etc.) but also feel that i in actuality ""paid "" for them in my play. So I guess it evens out."
"I want to thank all of you who posted your thoughts, espcially those that haven't been going to Vegas for years. Your observations are just as valid as those of us who have seemingly been going to Vegas forever.Whether you know it or not, you just witnessed one of the worst periods in Las Vegas hotel/casino history. And to a certain extent Las Vegas reacted to their problems in many of the same ways they always have. Hotels filed bankruptcy and closed, some of them changed hands, many restaurants closed, all construction came to a halt, and any improvements that did not produce revenue just did not happen. And worst of all 1000's were thrown out of work, which very much caused all of Las Vegas to suffer.Most people have no clue how close MGM-Mirage was to being forced into bankruptcy in May 2009, they were literally down to a few days. And when the current owners of CET (CZR) finally manage to unload or break away they will incur the greatest financial loss in casino history.And all of us benefitted from the bad times in Vegas. It doesn't matter if you stayed at Wynn or Harrahs your stay was cheaper. If you were smart you took advantage of this once in a lifetime occurance, possibly staying at a hotel you couldn't normally afford. Or maybe going to a fancy restaurant using their discounted menu. I know we certainly did. Years from now posters will be waxing nostalgic about the ""golden era"" of 2008-2011.I've read that many are blaming corporate Las Vegas, and I thinks it's really unfair that I should be put in the position of defending them. I agree with many of the points made about the corporations, and anyone who reads my posts realizes that I abhor many of the changes made by both CET and MGM.But corporate ownership also saved Las Vegas. Just as junk bond financing and leveraged buyouts did earlier. Do you know of any individuals who would risk $2B+ to build a new hotel/casino? Or keep pumping money into a chain of casinos that is $20B in debt? They brought a new wave of luxury to Las Vegas, and made it affordable to the average man. They also transformed Las Vegas into a mecca of fine dining. As far as the gambling goes, of course I agree it's worse now. But don't just blame the big bad corporations. Anyone who plays at a BJ table with bad rules and payoffs, or VP with bad paytables, when there is better gambling right down the street deserves to be stuck with those games.I'm not looking to argue, but I did enjoy all the comments. Thanks for participating."
"I for one would love to see a return to some standards in how people dress. As losvu pointed out, it used to be expected that men would wear suits to dinner or to a nightclub. Nowadays people are horrified at the idea that maybe tattered denim shorts and a tank top might not be appropriate attire for a nice restaurant. The reason for dressing nicely is not to show off, but to show respect for your surroundings and your neighbors, just like in church.I am speaking mostly of my fellow men here, as women generally enjoy dressing up a bit when they visit Las Vegas."
"Why does it matter what people wear? You really think a book is better if it has a fancy cover? It is what is written inside the book that really counts. I have no idea what Boston is like but in Seattle the only thing people care about is how you treat others, how smart you are, and how much money you have generally in that order. Most offices around town the only person wearing the suit is the copier repair person."
"Kt: I do think your spot on with a possible golden era of staying in luxury rooms and restaurants that would be out of pocket reach to most. You are exactly right on how the town was rescued economically. But the question still begs an answer: Who has changed? Did Vegas change or did the visitor change.? Always love a thread that at least gets you thinking, not many do. Thank you."
"Stratton: I was in Vegas when you brought gowns, shoes, suites etc, etc. You needed a trunk of cloths for Vegas. I for one, love the fact that I can go to any event now comfortable. After being a cloths hoarse for years and having to dress every darn day looking like I came out of a showroom. I'm sorry, I love the fact that I can wear sneakers, walking shoes, comfortable cloths and I don't have to run and change outfits every couple of hours. I do love to see men dressed. BUT there is no way, we would think about packing suits, and all that gear now. For me, it's a relief. We certainly don't dress like slobs but no more showroom for me. That does not mean I want to sit down at a table with a bunch of kids with Cat in The Hat attire either."
"Hear! Hear! Agree with you 100 percent. I didn't read the posts about using the pool, but I agree that if you stay at Terribles, you shouldn't ask to use the pool at Bellagio. That is for the people who stay there. The exception to this is using the pool of a sister property. We were told we could use the MC pool when we were staying at New York, New York."
"This is almost like the cruising industry. If you read Cruise Critic you see all these people who have cruised with the same companies for years just so they can get free laundry and some internet minutes, and maybe some free food at a special party. They are literally spending thousands being loyal to get some cheap ""comps"" from the cruise lines.Just recently one of the cruise lines cut back on free internet for their top tier members and you would have thought the world had ended. Now the sense of entitlement in the cruising world seems way bigger compared to what I have seen on these forums!!"
"As I’ve been going to Vegas since the mid-80’s, I can agree with the fact that people have changed in some aspects in their philosophy and expectations when visiting Vegas and it would never occur to me now or then to even want to use the pool or other guest amenities at another hotel (anywhere, not just Vegas). But…..in some cases the hotels actually promote it themselves as all parts of the properties are now considered ‘attractions’ to visit or places to gamble.And I also think a lot of it has to do with the hotels and the technology changes as much or even more that the ‘people changes’.We knew nothing about comps on our initial visits. We thought that was only for big gamblers. We hit the jackpot when we found out the casinos would give you a free deck of used cards from the casino if you just asked….wow, SCORE! We got a deck from nearly every casino in Vegas on our first trip as souvenirs (still have most of them).The biggest differences now IMO is that people are much more aware of the comps, freebees, discounts, etc. that are available to them, due to both computers and the hotels policies. This makes people expect them as they’ve ‘earned them’. Every hotel will give you a players card now that will track your every transaction while gambling (or spending) without anymore effort than sticking it in a slot to be scanned or showing it to an employee. Every hotel/casino will give you literature on exactly what you have to do to ‘earn’ different comps, upgrades or amenities and they all have ‘players club’ booths to assist you. Once a hotel/casino has your personal information because you’ve stayed at their properties, signed up ‘anywhere’ for a players card or even bought tickets for a show…..you WILL receive emails or mailers offering you discounts, comps or deals to come back and visit their properties again, regardless of whether you are a whale or didn’t gamble at all in their casinos."
"I see changes on both sides. When I first went to LV in the late 70's it was dress up all the time. I do miss it but I wouldn't want to return to long gowns and high heels.My first gambling visit was with a friends moms' fiance. It was all about power of the pen. We got picked up in a limo, could sign anything to the room and wow was I impressed. We stayed at Caesars with mirrors above the bed and it had a HUGE ,big enough for numerous people if you were so inclined, tiled jacuzzi tub You were greeted by name. Now it all about tracking you with slot cards, the big glamor is gone.I feel many people do feel a sense of entitlement but I think this is a problem with our entire country. Give me something for nothing is becoming a very common mantra. I don't understand how so many folks feel that way.On the other hand with the internet and forums I think many folks are now aware of comps and will ask for them. Returning to LV after many years of not going I now will politely request a comp. I do not feel that is entitlement I am gambling with my money and It doesn't hurt to ask. Some folks tip for a better hotel room is this really so different from years ago when you tipped for a good seat in a show? Interesting topic loving the comments.Edited: 8 years ago "
"I believe that people have changed. For those that mentioned costs today vs yesteryear, I paid $16K for my first house. Could you imagine how I would have felt to know that one day I would pay more than $30K for a car?People are better educated today and that translates to younger people being more affluent. That DOESN'T translate to them being as appreciative of luxuries that the older generations were. I am totally on board with the OP. Good post."
"I don't think this issue is even Vegas-specific. People ask for free and discounted things everywhere, every day. Go ask the cashier or service desk manager at your local supermarket how many people want their items marked down because their cereal box or can is dented. At a restaurant, many people will complain about their meal after they have eaten it, just hoping for free desert or money off their bill. Not everyone does this, but if I was a betting girl (and I am!) I would wager that some of these same people are the people trying to get something for nothing in Vegas. When it comes to the comp system, though, I think things are different. An expectation has been created for the casino to take care of the player in some fashion. I would be lying if I didn't say I don't make the most of room comps offered to me. I don't ask for more, and I don't expect more. But, I will take what is offered. If these comps disappeared tomorrow, I would probably still visit Vegas, but possibly less. The room comp helps ""justify"" losses incurred while gambling. I would lay out plenty of cash whether I were in the Carribean, Hawaii, Europe, you name it. The comped rooms help make Vegas a more attractive place to leave my money!"
"I dont think it is just Vegas, I think society in general has become ""entitled""....I work in a junior high and I see how the kids (and parents) think they shouldnt have to take responsibility for anything. If the kids arent getting the grades (because they arent working for them) it is the teaching staff's fault, the school's fault, the state's fault for not keeping better track of them. Whatever happened to if you fail, you take the consequences of it....that's how I was raised....it blows my mind when I see how the kids are never the ones held accountable...thus the reason the up and coming adults feel so ""entitled""...they arent used to having to work for or earn what they want in life...just give it to me...it's somebody else's fault if I cant do it for myself."
"Fascinating thread, thanks for posting it ktinca.I am kind of in the middle - my first trip to Vegas was in the 90s right after NYNY opened. I was 14 at the time, and this was during the ""Vegas is a family resort"" heyday. It was a great time to be a kid in Vegas - we went to a bunch of the arcades, the MGM's amusement park, stayed at Circus Circus (hideous carpets, lol), and went down to Fremont Street.I've been back to Vegas four or five times as an adult, although I mostly do it a bit differently than the majority of visitors. We do timeshare exchanges, so I've never stayed at one of the hotel properties, and we're extremely low-rolling gamblers. I just picked up my first players' card on the last trip & that only because the woman sat down next to me while I was playing the slots (penny Texas Tea) and asked if I would like to sign up. We mostly go to tour the hotels, see a show or two, and have dinner at some of the mid-range places, like Nine Fine Irishmen. I would never expect a place to comp me on anything, as I know I haven't earned it and really, never will. I like the flexibility of not being tied to a particular casino. I barely even know which ones belong to which groups. That said, if the hotel is going to offer me something, I am not adverse to accepting. I'm not big on the pool scene, but if I were and there was an option to buy a day pass for a hotel that I'm not staying at, why shouldn't I take advantage? Of course, there are others who would want to get in for free, but throughout history there have always been people who want something for nothing/feel entitled.I've changed and Vegas has changed. In my case, I feel like we've grown up together, as Vegas when I was a kid was focused more on catering to kids. Now, it's attracting the affluent, young adults and people with money to burn. I'm a cautious spender, but I can and have dropped several hundred dollars on a show ticket. I like Vegas because it's an easy flight from Seattle so that I can get my 'sun fix' (I usually go in winter/spring), there are a wide variety of things to do and see, and best of all, no car is required. It's my easy 'get away from life' destination.Side note about clothes - while I enjoy dressing up to go out, I'm an extremely light packer and the only time I have ever gotten blisters in Vegas was the last trip, which was the first time that I dressed up rather than for comfort and wear my usual comfy shoes. I certainly wouldn't show up at Picasso in shorts, but I and my feet are glad that standards are relaxed compared to the glamor days!"
"Like most others, I think this is a most fascinating post and I agree 100% with ktinca.All one has to do is look at the cruise threads to see how we've become such an entitled society. You'll read things like, ""I paid a lot of money for this cruise, this is MY vacation and I WILL wear my cut off jeans, wife beater and old sneaks to the Captain's dinner"", or they'll complain about the cost of drinks, then go so far as to buy a special bladder they attach to themselves and fill it with alcohol. There are even websites devoted to teaching you how to smuggle booze onto a cruise. Don't even get me started on the ""chair hogs"". LOL I just wish we could go back to when everyone knew the rules and played by them and had respect for each other. I know, I'm very naive. My husband tells me that all the time."
"I think everyone knows by now that if you never ask for it, there will never be a yes for that extra perk/upgrade.I think not just in Vegas, but in general travelers/consumers are more demanding than ever before, and that is not necessary a bad thing.One major change that I've seen in terms of visitors to Vegas compared to like 20 years ago, is the disappearing Asian whales. I see them in Macau now, and the amount they gamble in high stakes table games puts high stake gaming in Vegas to shame."
"Studies done on school uniform policies have shown that the way people dress affects the way they behave. That's not to say that there aren't badly behaved people who are dressed up, but you are less likely to act like a slob or a fool or get into a violent altercation.I am not saying everyone should have to be dressed to the nines all the time. I'm just suggesting that the pendulum has swung a little too far in the other direction."
"Excellent post kt. I first visited Vegas in the mid 80s so even though I was too late for the genuine ""old school"" days, it was certainly a different universe to what we see today. Lots of good comments from others too. And a welcome back to the forum from me to stratton. I know it's been a few days now but good to see you here. It had been too long.. :-)"
JupiterJoe hit it on the nail. Thanks for your insight.
""" I don't think Las Vegas has changed as much as the people who go there.""We now seem to live in a cradle to grave society with the mentality of free, give me more, I expect it. Just look at what goes to LV these days."
"The corporations are what killed it... If you have a bad experience at Luxor your first night of your first trip to Vegas, look around? You are surrounded by other properties owned by the same corporation. Same goes for Flamingo or Harrah's. And a lot of people don't know it. I have read a lot of eBooks on the ""good old days,"" and it seems like you HAVE to ask now to get anything. Even since my parents were there in the 80s, times have changed so much."
I totally agree too many people are expecting something for nothing just because of what used to happen in Vegas. I don't do a lot of gambling so I don't walk in and expect to be given an upgrade for $20. i'd like to think if I keep going to the same hotel every time I go back they might give me a couple of free nights but certainly don't expect it!! There are to many people around today (not just coming to Vegas) who just want something for nothing!!
Thanks blagger...it's great to see there are still some familiar names here like you giving good avice.
"Vegas has never been better today vs the last 30 years!Love ktinca's posts.30 years ago there was no:Bellagio Fountains, Wynn/ Encore, Mandalay Bay/ The Hotel, Planet Hollywood, Venetian/ Palazzo, Cosmopolitan, Forum Shops, North/ South Shopping Outlets, Smith Center, Cirque Du Soleil, Blue Man, Garth Brooks, City Center, QUA, Canyon Ranch....XS, Pure, Surrender, Marque and all the incredible restaurants I can't type - you eat from the buffet. Yes Tropicana had the first ""resort pool"", but they didn't invest in their pool/ resort enviroment. Wynn was next with the Mirage and built on what Tropicana started, Tropicana did not keep up and their pool today is exactly what it was 30 years ago.Las Vegas is THE city in the world that best represents capitalism. Always adapts to who is spending money on what.The biggest change was the business modell of the resorts. In the past, the casino was the top in the organization. They could hand out meals, rooms, tickets.... (all at a much lower quality than today). Today, as many have mentioned, there is a distributed profit contribution. The pool, the bars, the restaurants, even the gyms need to generate revenue or they don't get resort floor space.But by leasing floor space to Grand Lux, SW, Del Monico's.... everyone benefitsVegas is far from what it was 30 years ago - it is so much better!"
"To be clear - Steve Wynn built the Mirage as the first themed destination resort in Las Vegas and is considered a pioneer. At the time, people thought he was crazy for building a resort that needed $1M/ day in gambling revenue. IMO tropicana was the first to this market, just didn't capitalize on it."
"This has been a fascinating thread to read and very informative on how long time visitors have seen Vegas change. I'm relatively new to Vegas, having made my first trip in 2004 and only started visiting regularly 3 years ago. I come to Vegas for all the usual reasons - gambling, good dining options, shows, reasonably priced hotel rooms. I consider my gambling money an entertainment expense and expect it to be gone when I'm done. If I come home with money in my wallet, that's a bonus. And I'm a low roller, generally no more than $100/day. We're also downtown people, so don't gamble much on the Strip. We always stay at Main Street Station because the rooms are inexpensive, large, clean and comfortable. And because the staff there has always treated us like they appreciate our business. The first time I got an offer of a comped room I was blown away. Me, with my miniscule gambling budget? Do I feel like I'm entitled to them. Not really. I don't bring a lot of money into their casino. Will I take advantage of the free room? Yes. But I'm not going to make a special trip to Vegas just to do so. If I've got a trip planned, then sure. If I continued to spend the same amount of money and stopped getting offers, would I still stay there? Yes. We like the place, that's why we stay there. I like the discussion that arose regarding dressing for dinner. Do I want to see a return to evening dress for dinner and/or shows? No, I can't afford to dress that well. :) When we splurge on a nice meal in an expensive restaurant, do I expect to go in very casual clothes? Not at all. I dress as well as I can- sometimes a summery dress, sometimes silk pants and nice top. I would feel very uncomfortable dressed in less in a nice restaurant. I am usually surprised when I see other people dressed very casually in a fine dining establishment. Maybe that dates me (I'm in my 50s). I do think that the attitude towards dressing well (or not) for a nice meal is related to the growning sense of entitlement seen in the general public. I work in retail and see a lot of this - there's been a real upswing in the number of people who want something for nothing or who believe they should be treated better than the rest for no discernable reason."
Of the subject a little but I am reading 'Winner Takes All' by Christina Blinkly. Its an incredible insight into the making of 'modern' Las Vegas. Wonderful accounts of how Wynn wanted to introduce luxury via the Bellagio and how Kerk Kerkorian had his sights set on getting the Mirage of Wynn. Oh yes and a mention of how Trump tried to get in on the action. Think its strange how he didn't get a gaming license? When you read this you'll begin to understand why. It really is a fascinating read.
Kincaid -- nice post
"A casino group changes their formula that will make it harder to earn rewards, and you take issue with those that will switch their loyalty? How is that entitlement?? It's simple economics to go with who gives you the best return. If another casino chain offers a better return, then there's no issue switching. Don't blame the end-user on corporate policy changes."
"A lot of people flew to Las Vegas in the 70's. I admit to remembering all the shows. Don't remember the price but it couldn't have been too expensive. You could see an early dinner show and then a later show where I think you had to order a couple of cocktails. Hard to get a room when the Rat Pack was in town. You could, of course, see Liberace or Elvis or Mitzi Gaynor or Debbie Reynolds.Anyone remember the Lounge Shows. Free for just a couple of cocktails. When did the lounges go away?"
"When did the lounge shows go away: When they could not make enough money off them. Every inch of space has to turn a revenue. It's business and nothing more: The question I would like to ask? Speaking of entitlement. Has there been any of us here that has felt they were entitled to anything more than what they paid for or gambled for. I would guess the answer of most would be no. I think that most of us just want a good time, fare shake and what they are paying for. Is there anyone that wants more than that? (except a jackpot) So what would the sense of entitlement be? If the hotel will give the upgrade for $20.00. That's there policy, no one is holding a gun to there head to do it. They have thousands of rooms. The check in only does what they are ALLOWED to do. Bottom line. If you ask and get it, they know exactly what they are doing. Anything else could have there job. They will not risk that for you.They cannot give away comps unless you are a player. They will not give away rooms unless you are a player. Drinks, it's a tip. RFB - only if you have played enough.They meaning the hotels and casinos have taught us to do it all. TV, Books, (Jean Scott) Frugal Gambler. Ads, In the casino, you are approached, sign up and we will then rate you and you are entitled to this. They have taught us to become or think we are entitled. In retrospect. We are entitled to only what we have paid or gambled for. There are no other entitlements. The person that has not visited Vegas in years might no be in the loop of how it works. They sure find out fast. So the word entitlement in Vegas is really long gone. You can swipe your card in the MGM casinos to tell you how much you have earned and what you will get for that. So still don't see the word entitlement being used in the Vegas landscape. It's over. Gone."
"Well,I go to Las Vegas to eat at the buffets,drink beer(Miller Lite...Hey,that's what I enjoy!) and gamble. I would still do it even if they had no comps. Comps are great but I am there to have a good time and not worry about an up-graded hotel. If I want a strip view and it costs extra,I will pay for it before we leave for Vegas.If I want a suite,we will pay for it in advance.The only thing I ever ask for is a room on a high floor if it's available. My first trip to Las Vegas was 1989 and I have been there over 70x since. I have seen the slow deterioration of (customer) service,gambling rules,slower than ever drink service (How hard is it to get me a beer while I'm at the tables?) and yes,clientele. I still love that place but it doesn't hold the same specialness it used to for me. ktinca,this is probably the best post (and some of the greatest replies) I have read since I have been reading this forum! EXCELLENT postEdited: 8 years ago "
"The best thing I remember from the '70's was the complete lack of douchebags. Everyone had class or at least acted that way. And you better know what you were doing at the tables. No margin was given for being a dummy. If you showed up at a nice restaurant not dressed for the occasion, you were simply ignored.And the CW's and cigarette girls were stone cold beautiful who took great pride in their looks. Quite unlike the soccer moms who work there now.There weren't any CDS shows. You drove down the Strip and saw marquees proclaiming Ann-Margaret, Debbie Reynolds, Buddy Hackett.True, there are no more $1.99 Prime Rib specials.Once again, I blame the teachers spreading their liberal twaddle and creating generations of entitled brats who face zero consequences for anything that they do or please. Nothing is out of limits now and everyone expects it."
"""Speaking of entitlement. Has there been any of us here that has felt they were entitled to anything more than what they paid for or gambled for.""But isn't that what gambling is? It's hard to say someone ""earned"" their winnings by throwing in a few quarters (or dollar bills).Otherwise, people that feel they are entitled to something in Vegas probably has the same feeling back home."
isnt it just that people want free stuff as everything else is now more expensive
"""A casino group changes their formula that will make it harder to earn rewards, and you take issue with those that will switch their loyalty? How is that entitlement?? It's simple economics to go with who gives you the best return. If another casino chain offers a better return, then there's no issue switching. Don't blame the end-user on corporate policy changes.""Precisely. The players clubs are marketed as loyalty programs. If you are loyal to a brand in exchange you are promised rewards for it. When a loyalty program changes it's ways, a customer has every right to take a step beack a reevaulate their relatationship with that business. This thread is a bit self righteous, especially considering that a number of the behaviors being labeled as entitlement on consumer are actually encouraged with the way casinos operate. The reality is that no matter what it was like 30-40 years ago, we don't get the same bang for the buck by comparison because of a deterioation of service and quailty up and down the strip. I don't agree with the attempt to pool hop or pushing for free upgrades but as it relates to comps, the casinos created that system and because of the internet and other resources, people know not to let themselves to be taken for granted."
"Wow, what a bunch of cry babies, elitists and arrogants. Las Vegas has changed. The world has changed.There's a great book called ""Who Moved My Cheese"" that is focused on the premise that change happens and it is up to us to either go along with the change and prosper, or ignore that change is happening and become a dinosaur. I suggest that everyone get a copy of this and read it.People, like it or not, Las Vegas is not like it was was 30 or 50 years ago. You have no choice whether to accept it or not. So stop whining."
"Whoa... While I neither agree nor disagree with your's or any other's thoughts with regard to consumer vs. corporate greed, it is extremely unfortunate that the last few posters are souring what has to date been one of the more thought provoking threads ever posted on this forum. My apprecitation to all of those who have invested their time and insight. Shout out to ya Ktinca...well done!!"
"I understand comps and marketing. I understand customery loyalty programs, frequent flyer miles, credit card rewards, buy 9 sandwiches get 1 free, etc. They are all part of our society. And possibly help make us part of a ""what's in it for me"" time and place. And I'm not questioning those who use the comp system, and follow the rules to maximize their return.But I still don't understand staying at 1 hotel and using the pool at another. You must know that they built the fancy pool to give people a reason to stay at their hotel. Why would anyone think it should be available to non-guests? And why would anyone think they should be able to bring in their own drinks, to avoid spending money at the pool? Again, they built and maintain that fancy pool partly to make money selling drinks---consider it the price of using the pool. Why would anyone think they shouldn't have to pay that price? When I was younger and went to Vegas people just didn't think that way."
"Amen ktinca. The almost daily posts about wanting to ""use the pool at X hotel because my pool at Y hotel sucks"" are probably my least favorite, and one I have to respond to often. Why would people consider this acceptable?"
"JMO: The global marketplace is what changed Vegas. Macau, the Indians and all the fake riverboats. When services topped gambling as the bigger revenue streams, was when all bets were off. Actually Im sure it began much before, but that is a good mile marker. Before, it would appear that food options were there to keep gamblers on the property..gambling. Now I can only imagine it is quite different."
"Well as a long time vegas veteran, I can tell ya - one I agree with ktinca - vegas(and the world) have changed big time. I too recall spending time at Tropicana because of the pool and it was a perk we were willing to pay for - plus the little garden rooms you could just drive up to and not schlep through the casino. It was a simpler time and a different breed of people. There was an expectation of a decent meal for a decent price, headliner shows and decent gaming. I would never expect to use the amenities of a hotel I wasn't staying at. I was happy with what would now be considered a basic room.So what changed? Well people for one - each generation has deteriorated in their sense of entitlement as well as basic tenets of respect and civility. The economy has tanked. There are more choices, people want ""bang for the buck"". As for the ""loyalty"" programs - its truly crap - they are giving nothing away - while I do not profess to understand the nebulous system of comps - I have been flown to vegas on comps with a comped room, food and beverage and $1k slot play and at other times (with no change in play) been offered just about nothing except a room. I do not play to earn comps but I can tell you that once you get them - you tend to expect them - do I feel entitled no I wouldn't say that but I will go where I get the best bang for my buck. I just look at it as a skewing of my budget- in the old days I paid for a room, food and shows and gambled x....now much of that is comped and I gamble x - is s more because I get those things ""free"" - probably but my overall budget is the same. Are any of the casinos ""loyal"" to me - no chance - you are only as good as your last visit or two or 6 depending on the property. So, go for fun, don't play more than you can afford and enjoy. And just because the world has gone to heck in a hand basket - its still appropriate to be respectfu,, be nice and dress appropriately for the situation - blows the younger generations minds but hey hard to teach an old dog....."
"Does anyone remember the word junkets: Something that has not been around for a while: They used to fly you out: Room, Flight, Food: You had to gamble of course, to earn the junket. It was basically near the same system: As far as the pool goes: I was always under the umbrella of the casino you chose, was the pool you used: Would have never expected anything more: I do think the casinos are creating a different system now: If you stay at this hotel you can use these certain pools: Maybe that is the reason people are asking if they can use the more popular ones. It is also the casinos job and they do it well to maintain there system of who gets to use it and who does not. Do understand some of the complaints though: Someone has paid for there hotel experience and wants to use the pool and then finds out: A chair or a space is not even available. Would make me mad: This would have never happened back in the day: They would have made room. Basically it's a continuous changing cycle that all of us have to keep on top of. The RULES change in a nano second. It's just where there revenue is coming from. As Roadnut stated: MGM gearing the loud music to the younger kids: There not in the casino so get the revenue by the pool. It's still just dollars.Breeze: The teachers: Come on: The teachers that get paid nothing to work with handcuffs behind there back: No: I was one for a while: That is just out there. No teacher teaches a kid entitlement. I had to just comment on that. No:"
"I think that technology has driven a lot of the changes in the recent past. As KTINCA said, you used to get a comp if some pit boss decided to recognize your play. Slot players received very little in the way of comps as it was difficult to tell how much an individual was playing. With improved technology came the slot cards and the casino then had the ability to see how much individual players were contributing to the casino's bottom line. With that development, it wasn't long before someone decided that they needed a point system to keep score. The result has been slot clubs that let their members know what the can expect back as the result of their play. Credit card companies do the same thing, and I don't think we would complain of anyone's sense of entitlement if they read the fine print in the credit card contract, or their frequent flyer plan, to find out what they can expect in return.I agree that the hotels in Las Vegas are a tremendous bargain, but I don't think I'm feeling greedy or ""entitled"" because I expect my loyalty to be rewarded. MLife has gotten in trouble with its members recently because they announced a change that cuts the comps in half while trying to tell its members that they are ""Improving"" the system. They should have said that the MLife experiment has proven to be far too costly, so they need to scale it back. I recognized from the beginning that it was overcomping a lot of folks, but I decide to enjoy the ride while it lasted."
"Mike your spot on: Only thing, I think M-Life should just admit they have made a total mess of it all. CET has def recognized this and are courting there players as we speak."
"Kt .....I have to agree with you. We have created a culture of an empowered consumer, which is fair, but some people take it to extremes.- obsession and complaints about ""free"" wifi ...hey somebody is paying for that infrastructure, router, encryption, etc. I hope next time you're lurking around a closed Starbucks to save $10 someone intercepts the signal and drains your checking account.- ""free"" drinks are slow, watered down, not top shelf, etc. ugh.- cooler to the pool, sneaking into pools, - $20 tip failed to secure fountain view- $100 per night cc hold is 'unconsciable', 'criminal', 'ruined my trip'......- abusing players club lounge by stuffing bottled water into back packs, loading up on snacks to go....""hey it's free, right?""That's my rant of the day. Good topic."
So enjoying this post.
"Great post. Since I am a relative newbie (first trip in 2003) my guess is that it is a combination of the people and Vegas.I would love to know what the difference in income of visitors now as compared to the good old days. Just from my observation (and it's not the clothes) there are more people there today who never would have gone back then because they couldn't afford it. When I was a child, only my parents' rich friends went to Vegas. Now, if you can get there, you don't need much money. Could it be that more money was spent per person back then than it is now? How many of the visitors are just walking around looking and not spending a dime? It's a great place to go for a cheap vacation.That and the sense of entitlement seems to have changed the vibe.And I'm with Stratton on the clothes. It's not a boardwalk."
"Add to that, the people that acknowledge that they get hotel rooms way cheaper here than they would get for the same accomodations elsewhere, then go on to complain about the $6 beers and higher-priced meals. They do have to make that someone somewhere!!!"
"ktinca posted: ""But I still don't understand staying at 1 hotel and using the pool at another. You must know that they built the fancy pool to give people a reason to stay at their hotel.

""Well, I posted my opinion about all this earlier. People think differently, that's fine but I think you are off on one presumption here.They built the pool to give people a reason to stay at the hotel? Not necessarily true. That's why it technically may have been built but the strategy, the way for the hotel to get the most out of it, can change over time and the pool area may be developed to service that. A number of resorts have figured out that they can make money by charging non guests to use the pool. The resort gets an admission fee, sells some drinks and most importantly gets the people on property for a while and hopefully they will gamble.Caesars, Mirage, Hard Rock, MGM, etc are all doing this for very good reasons, it makes money and people like it. So the pools now aren't just to get people to stay at the hotel. They are to get people to come to the hotel. I understand people getting annoyed at folks asking about using other hotel's pools and not expecting to pay to get in and thinking they can bring their own drinks, yeah, that's kinda cheap. But really, any pool that hosts gambling like swim up blackjack (I think Trop, MB, Hard Rock, Rio, Wynn and more) can not legally charge a fee or prohibit the public from visiting. (e) To ensure that gaming is conducted honestly, competitively and free of criminal and corruptive elements, all gaming establishments in this state must remain open to the general public and the access of the general public to gaming activities must not be restricted in any manner except as provided by the Legislature.…state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-463.html#NRS463Sec0129?Edited: 8 years ago "
"Hmm, to elaborate on my last point looks like a few pool areas have an exception due to offering an amenity or attraction that makes an entrance fee for non guests 'necessary.' Hard Rock meets this but many others don't.Some places that have no general allowance for non guests (meaning they don't sell admission to the public) will allow you to visit the pool for the 'purpose of gambling' in accordance with the law I noted above. Interesting.Edited: 8 years ago "
"And I've obviously got too much spare time on my hands right now so I'm thinking too much here but ktinca, who has posted about using another hotel's pool and bringing in their own drinks? I've seen a number of people asking about doing it at the hotel they are staying at. But who has posted where they presumed to use another hotel's pool for free and smuggle in drinks? Genuinely interested in reading any examples.Edited: 8 years ago "
"Doug you have a valid point: As Joe Pesci says in the movie Casino: It's the Dollars, it's always the Dollars."
"I totally agree with all that you have said... it's a shame that things change, but they do and we have to accept them.As an aside we stayed at the GN a few years ago - now we are mere guppies in the Las Vegas ocean, but we played Let it Ride every night for at least 4-5 hours... no big wins, and no expectations of comps.By the fourth or fifth night we had befriended the pit boss, and he wanted to see if he could get us free show tickets, but of course our game play spend wasn't good enough. Bless him, he tried to 'dodge' the system but ended up being berated by his bosses, which was the last thing we wanted. He was obviously 'old school' and tried to reward us for our casino loyalty, but the computerised and automated systems in place barred his way. We never 'expect' anything when we go to LV - and any little rewards we do get makes us really happy! Easily pleased is the phrase I think!"
"I went to Vegas last year for the first time (I’m 26 so can’t compare then and now) and we just wanted to get away from London for a bit, and we’re on a budget so we went for the Riv (and I’m a roller girl and wanted to see where roller con and the Sin City girls are based – yes I’m a nerd). When we got there it wasn’t a long queue at all but this guy was screaming at the girl behind the desk because they wouldn’t upgrade him, he left to find another hotel. When we went up to the desk after him she seemed a bit flustered and we were like ‘oh take time to chill out a bit after that dude’ and she gave us an upgrade just for asking if she was ok. It was a nice surprise, but I’m not counting on it happening again next year when we go."
"To add to the pot, I do go for the pool in the summer. There are only certain hotels I will stay in because of the pool. If it's not pool weather, I'm not particular and will expand my options of where I will stay. Then again, the hotels are not counting on me for gambling money."
"I want to add that the pool in question at Mirage is Bare, not the regular pool.Kt, I think that people behaved better in the old days because there was always the thought somewhere in everyone's head that the mob was running the show, and like the song says, ""Step of line, the man come, he take you away""."
"My understanding is that the resorts are divided into entities: hotel, restaurants, bar, gambling, pool, shows and each is headed by a boss whose job is to make a profit.If I'm the pool boss and my performance agreement is for me to increase profits by 12% from last year's, I will tell my staff to let in any one who wants to come to my pool, irrespective of where they stay because I then increase my chance of selling 3, 4 drinks, positively impacting my bottom line and helping me meet my 12% target. I don't care about hotel patrons because that's not what my performance is based on.If I'm the hotel boss, I need to turn a profit too so my rooms are priced on expected capacity. Some rooms are paid for by Total Rewards/Mlife and they give them for free but the hotel boss is ensured that the rooms are paid for by internal vouchers. He too has to turn in a profit. And he can make renovations if he needed but the expectations for profits increase in the first 12 months following the renovations.Every sector has to turn in a profit and every boss will want to meet their target.Edited: 8 years ago "
"Pacifi - I believe that your example breaks the contract that patrons have with the hotel that there should be a full expectation to the use of all amenities.There is already a huge problem with obtaining loungers during the peak season and now you want to add to the problem by opening the door to the public just so this mythical manager can meet his profit goals?That just stinks, imho."
"It's not what I want, it's the reality I see. In the service industry, management position are becoming specialized. In restaurants, you have management specialized in the food served, management in the greeting and placing patrons, management in waiting tables. Same goes for all industries and the LV resort industry is no different.It's not what I want, it's what I see. If a club is not popular enough to charge the fee, you'll have people distributing ""free entry"" coupons on the Strip to attract folks who'll spend $15 for a gin tonic. If a pool becomes soooo popular that clients are ready to pay $20 to get in, increasing the margin, managers will charge the entry fee. If they can't make a profit, they will make any change they can to bring in the profit and if it means allowing guests from other resorts, they will do so.Money talks in all spheres of life, especially in LV, and when we want to sleep later and secure a lounger, at Mirage, we can pay $50 and have one. You bet it stinks, but it's the reality.You write ""I believe that your example breaks the contract that patrons have with the hotel that there should be a full expectation to the use of all amenities."" And you're bang on but the reality is that the hotel management does not have any control over pool management. Sure, they can try to influence things but in the end, it's the performance management agreement between the Director/big kahoona of the resort with the respective management that will decide."
"dougpickering: There is a lot in what you say. And NO ONE hates the way the Las Vegas pools have changed from guest amenety to opportunity for profit more than I. Right or wrong, I blame MGM-Mirage for this change in corporate attitude, because it didn't really exist before they started making changes. And the hotels have definitely changed.BUT the vast majority of posters who ask ""Can I stay at 1 hotel and use the pool at another"" have never been to Las Vegas before. They have not been influenced by the fairly recent changes in Las Vegas. They honestly want to know, and don't consider the prospect unusual. They want to know what is customary and acceptable.30 years ago the idea of staying at one hotel and using another's pool WOULD have been unusual. So unusual that none of us would have ever thought to ask the question. So it seems to me that it is peoples ideas and attitudes that have changed the most.""I think that people behaved better in the old days because there was always the thought somewhere in everyone's head that the mob was running the show, and like the song says, ""Step of line, the man come, he take you away"".Breeze: There probably aren't too many here that remember that period in Las Vegas, but I am one of them. And you are right. Whether it was perception or reality, there was a time when people though Las Vegas Blvd was the safest place in America. It didn't matter how much cash you walked out of the casino with you felt safe. Because you were under the protection umbrella of those who ran Las Vegas---and nobody would dare mess with their customers! My how things have changed. lol"
"I'll throw my 2 cents in and say first off I agree completely with ktinca's post.Although there have been many changes to the ""corporate"" life of Las Vegas many of the entitled comments or questions I see on this forum are not related to the travelers comparing it to the golden days, it's the young crowd looking for the most bang for their buck. Yes, you can say it's only fair to get the best deal you can but many of these attitudes go well beyond that and into the entitlement category.We see so much of the entitlement and indulgence factor in life - the reality shows PP mentioned, highly leveraged individuals who want the nice homes and cars before they can afford them. Vegas symbolized indulgence and fun life so I suppose it magnifies these broader society issues.Personally, I worry about the posters who want the lower end properties destroyed for more mega-resorts. I think the key to Vegas is a wide option of budgets for people. IP may seem like a dump compared to Bellagio, but it makes Vegas an affordable option to some."
AND the IP is profitable !!!!
"I'm in my early thirties, and I agree that I prefer when people dress up more. I can appreciate that others disagree - however, it cracks me up when someone says something like ""what matters is not appearances - if you think that you're shallow"" and then in another post is bashing a property for outdated decor. Either appearances matter, or they don't. So if you think they don't, don't expect your hotel to be any more than safe, clean and comfortable. If you are going to pay for a glamourous/luxury/updated property, don't act appalled when other patrons want you to dress to match your surroundings.Edited: 8 years ago "

"Apologies. Ktinca.I looked at this question as part of my MBA and undertook research over a 2 year period looking at the history of Las Vegas Casino resort operators' strategies, the behaviour and decision making of customers and how Las Vegas resort operators do (and should) address these customers going forward.The paper, to which I attach the link, was published by the fantastic Dr Dave Schwartz at the UNLV's Centre For Gaming Research. As such it is a bit clunky (as it is an academic paper) but I tried to make it accessible and use empirical data to look at the questions you pose.We look at the importance of comps (and expectation inflation), but there are several segments of customer where comps are irrelevant- however across all segments from high rollers to grind players and non-gamers, room price is! I would ask anyone is interested in Las Vegas resort operators' strategies to have a look: The link is to the paper on the UNLV site and is very, very safe!gaming.unlv.edu/papers/cgr_op19_lovat.pdf"
