Got another 9 nights here on KP but looking to move after that before flight samui to bkkAny sensible suggestions or advice?
"The most sensible advice is get back to the UK! You should have followed UK Gov advice and got the heck out of dodge. https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-s… Most hotels are restricting access, many are closing for 3 months, you are not allowed out on the streets, Samui is like a ghost town. Bars, restaurants, clubs, shops are closed. 7Elvens / Family marts are restricting their opening times.if you don't belive me, then look at the various live camers on Samuiwebcam showing on Youtube!Edited: 8:54 am, March 27, 2020 "

Hmmmmmm beautiful weather and beaches > UK weather and the chaos there
I'd rather weather a sh*tstorm in my home country than gamble on what can happen far away just for a bit of sun. Samui also sounds depressing as hell right now and you're meant to be staying in to avoid spreading the virus. That could get enforced strongly if irresponsible people don't comply meaning you might not be seeing much of swimming pools or the beach after all.
"I agree..... I'd get while the getting is good.AirAsia just suspended operation domestically for 1 month (April), and would expect others to follow.Some ferries have stopped, others cut schedule. Wouldn't be hard imagining getting stuck on Samui. om the not so distant future, if you decide to leave KPN."
"""UK weather and the chaos there""The weather has been gorgeous for the last 7 days or so, hardly a cloud in the sky, must be the lack of planes flying. It is a bit cooler than Thailand. It's up to you, but you may get stuck there. Many flights are being cancelled even domestic ones. If ferries do stop then you could get stranded like some in the Philippines."
"There is no chaos here! Its very organised and sensible. If you are taken sick in Thailand, having not followed UK Gov advice your travel insurance [if you have any] is now likely to be null and void, especially as you may struggle to find flights back now. I believe the army are in Samui to ensure that folks are staying put. Plus the ferries are going to really restrict."
We have valid insurance and happy to comply with all Thai guidelinesWas just a simple query about hotels and in another thread what places are open for sitting in foodThanks again guys for all your help
"""happy to comply with all Thai guidelines""""what places are open for sitting in food"" ..... none should be the answer ... IF complyingEdited: 12:52 am, March 28, 2020 "
"In Ko Samui now. Hotel pools are open and so are restaurants. No curfew. Nothing depressing about having a cool drink on the beach, which isn't overcrowded. No army on the streets. Just police checking temperatures of drivers on the road."

Cheers #10 will probably head there next week
"""We have valid insurance""Are you sure, is it a UK policy? If so have you got it extended to cover ""Non Essential travel"". Most policies automatically exclude it.Edited: 7:10 am, March 28, 2020 "
I don't know what U&R is. Why have my posts been removed?
">I don't know what U&R is. ""U&R"" probably means Unicorns & Rainbows. Read past posts from ""Not Me"" and you should be able to figure the out the intended meaning. >Why have my posts been removed?A sufficient number of forum members did not like each of your posts and voted them to be removed using the ""Report inappropriate content"" link available in each post to the forum. Only TripAdvisor know what is that sufficient number but it is likely to be larger than two.Edited: 8:05 am, March 28, 2020 "
"Yes probably members with invested interests in Koh Samui, they don't people to see other people views."
"I'm counting 5 now....they must PM each other and get any negativity removed. Though do notice, many re-appear now, so maybe TA is actually realizing their game, and reading the reported replies, and if not too off topic & information, reinstating them.I had about 5 removed in one day, and most reappeared the day after. Quite surprising."
Yes they often come back later or the next day.
#13 yes we are covered we have been in Thailand for 40 days so far
"That does not matter usually, the Govt. have changed their advise, you should check your policy, most exclude certain areas, ie ""the FCO advises against all but essential travel."" It is a standard exclusion in many travel policies, does not matter if were there before the advise came in."
#21 That's incorrect. Insurance is only invalid if you book a trip after the FCO advised against traveling. Example here:https:/…coronavirus-information
"As to suggestions or advice where to stay on Ko Samui, have a look at the area around Fisherman's Village, which remains one of the more lively parts of the island. Bophut beach has many hotels within walking distance to Fisherman's Village, In Bangrak beach, 2 km to the east, you will find many villas near the beach."

"It depends on the policy, some may cover it, I'm talking about ""the FCO advises against all but essential travel.""Some don't cover the virus it seems. That's why I said check the policy.Also ""The Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises British people travelling abroad to return to the UK now, if commercial flights are still available.""Edited: 11:44 am, March 28, 2020 "
"Yep, it's the FCO advising people to return home that's the issue. If you ignore this and later need to claim the insurance company could say it's your own fault and refuse to pay out.You are basically deliberately going against the instruction of the government.Edited: 11:50 am, March 28, 2020 "
"My policy says ""If you become ill while on holiday, your travel insurance covers your medical expenses abroad – unless you travelled to a location the FCO advised against.""So that is not clear, think there are loop holes insurers could use to avoid paying claims. Some policies also have max. days per trip, mine is 45 days, many are only 30 days."
"A lot of insurance policies have a general exclusion clause for epidemics and pandemics, meaning that any insurance policies are void for claims where epidemic or pandemic are concerned.We have a very comprehensive insurance and ours doesn't cover us at all for this pandemic - you had better check your policy for the general exclusions or e-mail your insurance company to check.Edited: 2:48 pm, March 28, 2020 "
"The UK gov exceptional travel advisory notice not only advised against all but essential international travel, but if you are currently travelling abroad, you are strongly advised to return now. where there are still commercial routes available. This will null and void your insurance as you did not follow advice. Then you are stuff!We have a very comprehensive insurance, but there is no cover should the UK gov give advice, in fact they sent us an email to confirm that we were not and if to travel to come home. Good luck.Covid19 won't ignore anyone, it is serious, thousands have died, don't be stuck in a thai public hospital with a HUGE medical bill you can't pay."
