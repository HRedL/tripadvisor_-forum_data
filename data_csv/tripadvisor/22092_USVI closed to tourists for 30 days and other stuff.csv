Does not affect you if you are already on islandnewsofstjohn.com/usvi-governor-tourists-cann…
"Thank you for sharing. A tough decision, but the right decision. Please come back when the islands are ready for you."
"This makes me so sad. I was scheduled to come April 15 for 10 days with my husband and 8 year old daughter who has never been. I had hoped that this would be sorted out by then and by some miracle we could come. There’s obviously bigger things in life than our vacation (like the health and safety of humanity), but I’m still disappointed. I guess it will be that much more sweet when we’re able to plant our feet on STJ!"
"Yes people will be unemployed and it will be difficult on everyone involved with St John - owners, maintenance, housekeeping. But this too shall pass just like 2017 hurricanes. Closing the island many will economically suffer but maybe not quite as many physically from this virus. Yes, it was the right thing to do closing off tourism. In the end we will all be better in the other side of this medical nightmare."
"My question is this, does this mean the airlines will be forced to cancel flights and refund . We cancelled our house rental last week. We were set to arrive on April 24th. We have not done anything with our airfare. I bought the tickets last June so if we rebooked it would only allow us to rebook to mid June."
Certainly doing the right thing isn't always easy and I am sure it was a hard decision. I hope everyone on and off island remain safe at this unsettling time in history. I have no doubt that humanity will rise to the occasion and hope that we will soon be able to return. My thoughts are will all those effected.
"We all have to fight that with the airlines. They should give a year from travel date. I am in the same position and the airline will get a big bailout from the gov't so they really need to be more flexible. I wrote to my senator about this. They have to cancel some flights and if they do they are supposed to give you a refund but might try to give you a voucher. I am watching this very closely because they probably will cancel my sisters flight from Syracuse but not mine from Boston. If you bought travel insurance and are in a state that is quarantined you might get paid, but it depends on the company."
Delta was super easy! I did it all online. They send you ecodes to use at a later date.
How long does the Delta credit last?
"Best decision. I would have shut down the airlines And trains 2 weeks ago. Drastic, yes, but necessary. Piece meal shutdowns just prolong the inevitable. I’m all in favor of just pulling the band aid off all at once. Economy will suffer, but if it means getting this virus under control it’s worth short term pain. Because once everything can reopen people will be anxious to rejoin society.Stay well and safe everyone."
Agree that Delta has been super easy. The ecredit lasts for one year from date of cancellation.
"Should've happened at least a week ago, which I said previously and was shredded for it here."
"TIMMMAXThere are many that are in denial until it hits home. Friends of mine that I had this lively discussion with over 2 weeks ago laughed at me when I said to shut everything down. Now we are one week into restaurants closed, bars, hairdressers, barbers, TJ Max, Christmas Tree Store, Governor telling everyone to stay home, casinos closed and on and on it goes. Everyday it’s something new. Stay strong and well"
This does not mean they are closing down all the flights. Most of them will be cancelled but there will still be a limited number of flights to/from the islands. People are there that need to get home and there are probably residents that need to get back. It is also how the mail and some supplies come in so it will probably not stop 100%.
"I think you were doing the shredding. I didn’t think we needed all this Sandy, but am with you....just wish they would have stopped everything at once for two weeks and move on. This trickle of Shutdowns makes it seem like it has been going on forever. My trip is day 31....we shall see!!"
Yes and my long awaited return isn’t until late July but we shall see!!!I’m hoping my late May trip to Texas to see my granddaughter graduate will happen. Fingers crossed!!!It’s double jeopardy for the islands just coming off rebuilding of tourism after the hurricanes. Could be financial ruin for some which is so sad. I know some of the smaller restaurants here may never recover.
"I feel for everybody, this is shaping up to be a huge disaster on so many fronts. Here's to better, brighter tomorrows."
"Well said, as usual, Sandy. I suspect there will not be any public commencement ceremonies until, at the earliest, maybe this fall."
"Jenn's blog is a great resource. Here is the original briefing by the Governor.https:/…tl;dr: The Governor said he cannot close the airport. Stay at home order starting Wednesday, without enforcement. Fines for hotels, guest houses, villas, bed and breakfasts, and similar businesses the register new guests; emergency and government personnel are exempted - subject to change. Lots of exemptions for business, pretty much any store that is not a restaurant/bar, no more than 10 patrons. ""This is not a curfew.""Update from the Governor on Monday.Airfare refunds? Spirit is still offering $80 rt from BWI. American, Cape Air, Delta, Jet Blue, Silver, and United are still flying and selling tickets. I cancelled my Monday flight to DC and I am working remote from the boat until things settle down.Cheers, RickGS/V EchoesCoral Bay, St. John"
United changed my direct reservation to DC on April 8 so instead of direct I have to fly to NY and then down to DC.The return was also changed. Things are too uncertain to book transportation unless you absolutely have to and have ample funds to pay for emergency transport.
You can see the governor's Saturday evening address here (there is so much scuttlebutt going around that it helps to sift fact from fiction)!:https://viconsortium.com/vi-coronavirus/virg…
