"At this time, we should be boarding Alaska flight #1230, nonstop from LAX to PVR. Alaska Airlines was wonderful to work with. I have a $196.14 credit with them. I rescheduled my trip for late October and the flights were less expensive.their daughter's destination wedding in Cancun.We had planned to spend last night at Embassy Suites LAX. Not a problem to reschedule. I felt so sorry for the reservation clerk I spoke with. They had to cancel Villa Mercedes was also a joy to work with. I received the sweetest email in response to my cancellation. I rescheduled with them, as well.Lindo Mar is closed, so Trading Places gave me back the week I lost when I cancelled. We had booked our last few days at Tropicana since Villa Mercedes was fully booked. I haven't heard from them. Maybe closed?Does anyone have a similar story to share? I'd be interested in hearing them. Stay healthy at home!"
"I'm bummed Iyam and I most likely won't get our 3 week girls trip in June or maybe not anytime this summer. But I have not made my flight reservations for June or December, so that isn't a problem. And I/we haven't canceled the condo for June because it is a friend and cancellation or change isn't a problem. And December is too far off to cancel condos yet, but admittedly it doesn't look good given the predictions by virus experts. When things open up here, I think my husband's and my life will be pretty much as it is now...at home. I love my house & property, but gosh I like to get out at home too! One thing that has helped me feel better, is my husband and I are planning on spending an extra month in PV in 2022 on top of the normal 6 weeks I spend in PV (he usually is there 3 weeks).., in 2022, assuming things will be better then. It's something to look forward to.Edited: 1:27 pm, April 16, 2020 "
We were booked to fly to PV and stay at the Rosita for two weeks on 11th May - I had been reading reviews for months planning all the wonderful restaurants we wanted to visit - some old favourites and a lot of new ones to us. We are so sad but will come back as soon as it is safe to travel again - hopefully we will be back next year.
"I am not going to cancel my accommodation in Hawaii for Nov/Dec. I am going to ""postpone"" it Until Nov/Dec 2021 as allowed by the rental company. Hopefully, we will get vouchers for our flights that we can use then."
I was due to arrive on May 23rd. Not anymore.
"Like Spotcat I was due to fly out this week via Alaska airlines. Early morning flight on 4/18 out of LAX, non stop with an arrival of time of noon. Got a 2 bedroom at Garza Blanca on an RCI exchange. Not doing the AI, was planning a grocery delivery from Robin at Pig Out. Mostly breakfast and munchie stuff. She was also going to take care of our wine/beer/spirit needs! Was so looking froward to staying at GB. Love that side of town and don't find it hard at all to go into town for meals. Have credit with RCI for my exchange fee and will keep looking for availability at GB for Nov/Dec timeframe. If nothing pops up then I will look at other resorts. Love LindoMar so that could be an option. Credit as well with Alaska. I canceled both reservations a couple of weeks ago once I knew April travel was going to be out of the question. I was sorry to see that my flights are still showing as available on Alaska! My two friends that were joining me were coming down on Southwest out of SJC. Their flights were canceled about 10 days ago.All in all I am an grateful that I am able to have the opportunity to reschedule and will do so once everything is safe."
"I just cancelled our condo reservation for mid February 2021 through VRBOIt just seemed too risky given the current situation.Happily we got a complete refund and hadn’t booked air yet.I am still hoping we can go and that we can book later, given what is happening. We also had an upcoming visit to an Immersive Van Gogh exhibit this spring in Toronto.They haven’t cancelled but have delayed it into the fall.I am less optimistic about that actually happening but the cost is far less.Stay well, everyone!"
"I was due to arrive in Palm Springs April 5th. I waited until Delta cancelled the flight, and called for a refund. The hotel is closed, has my deposit, and their message says to call after April 30th, that all reservations have been moved to a later date. Their website is not taking reservations at all. I called Chase and spent almost 2 hours on the phone trying to dispute the charge, but they refuse since they say the hotel is ""willing to work with me"" by having that message. I asked what happens if they change the message to call after Dec 31st, and was told same thing. They are still ""willing to work with me"". I received a ""thank you for staying with us"" and a survey to fill out on the day I was due to check out. Crazy. I have never had an issue disputing a charge, and did not expect this from Chase.Then May 18th I was supposed to be in PV. Again, I waited until Alaska cancelled the flight, then called and got a full refund. Tropicana (yes it is closed) was booked through a third party site, which I cancelled and received a full refund. Rebooked both flights and hotel for end of Oct, which like spotcat, cost less. Would rather have paid more and gone in May. :-(June 6th supposed to be going to Vegas to see Bill Maher. Now just waiting for the flight to be cancelled so I can receive a refund. I seriously doubt there will be any shows in Vegas by then. Did not even get around to booking a hotel.July 12th flight to Palm Springs, waiting for flight cancellation, no hotel booked.August 16th flight to Vegas. More of the same. This is the first one that I think might possibly happen, but in no hurry to book a hotel at this point.Yeah, I have the serious cancellation blues. I always have a trip booked, usually 2 or 3, all year long. That is how I keep my sanity, something to always look forward to. This is the first time in many years that I have no upcoming travel that I can actually count on. I am not so sure PV will be ready to visitors even at the end of Oct, especially if the dreaded 2nd round turns out to be true. Depressing, but at least I can keep planning and planning, and I have my health. For that I am blessed.Edited: 5:48 pm, April 16, 2020 "
"There are many people around the world including Canada & the USA that are dealing with Covid 19. Many have lost their jobs, have no money for doctors or food, & are losing their accommodations. We are very privileged to be whining about canceled trips. I am very thankful to have a full frig & pantry, a greenhouse & garden, a comfortable home, & children that shop for my groceries as they do not want to lose me to this virus.I look forward to the time when this plague is past. When, people do not fear for their lives."
Condo. Very Nice post. Agree with all on how lucky we are with our health not compromised by the covid-19 virus.
Thanks ConduYour post helps to put this all into a true perspective.Those of us who can travel are very privileged and we should never lose sight of so many in truly dire circumstances because of this pandemic
"We were scheduled to arrive on Monday. I've always loved to spend my birthdays in PV; this will be the first one I've missed in 14 years. Last week I opened up the 1 ltr bottle of Cazadores that I bought down there last year, made margaritas, and skyped with friends. But it just wasn't the same."
Condu - Good post and I agree with you. We are losing our shirts on our stocks but we know that it will recover. It will take some time but it will come back.We also feel very fortunate that we have our pensions coming in every month (we are retired). So many people have lost their jobs and cannot pay their rent.My husband's mother is 93 and in a seniors residence that don't have any Covid virus so that's good news as well.We have been back home since March 24th and only go out to get groceries or to the Pharmacy for meds.We feel so fortunate compared to so many others and count our blessings.
"50th wedding anniversary trip canceled. We'll celebrate at home & rebook when things settle, no big deal. Stay calm, wash your hands, avoid the crowds & start dreaming of your next trip. Safe travels Life is good."
I was sad to cancel my Pride/Restaurant week trip in May. It may eventually work out that I could have gone but just as likely that things will still be in a state of flux - too many balls in the air and until we get a lot more testing done I'm just not sure I want to climb into an airplane. Maybe for my birthday in November?
"We've got tickets booked with FF miles for November, but we'll both be 75 and even though in good health with no underlying health issues I'm not sure I'd want to be out of the country and catch covid-19. Unless there is a dramatic improvement in this pandemic we'll wait until just before the date for the airline to cancel our flights and if not pay a small fee to redeposit our miles."
"I wouldn't say that we're privileged. We worked hard for over forty years, hence have comfortable retirement plans. I feel okay about saying that I'm sad about my cancelled trip.Many others aren't as fortunate. I support local small businesses. I support food banks both at home and in Vallarta. Every little bit helps. That's how I'm spending the money I would have spent on vacation."
"I am in same boat as everyone. Condu made a nice post. I am also grateful I have food and such. My husband who employs my sons is tight for any work even though essential, so my family is not in a good situation. I have cancelled May vacation and my husband cannot even come to Mexici to be at our home, maybe in July. Cancellations thru RCI were easy, not so much with Interval. As much as I am sad about no vacation for awhile, I would love just to go out local or to Guadalajara but we are locked down and even to leave and come back by car, the area requires checkpoints, proof of residency so on. It is truly a very sad time for the world, lots of paranoia may continue for a long time and again many will go belly up. Agorophobia might be a big issue if this goes on too long. Hope, keep the faith and hope. When things open I for one will be out as life for me is not in a bubble but traveling. So strange to see differences in different countries handling of this virus. My suitcases are empty and not in sight..so very sad."
"Spotcat so sorry for your cancelled trip. And yes, the world is dealing with so many heart wrenching issues for now but it is still OK to grieve yet another thing lost. For me the cancellation also highlights the loss of income for so many in PV right now and the need for our support. So many had so little before C19 hit.I am sure many on this forum are helping as much as they can. And yes, one locally as so many needs also.Please stay safe and healthy everyone!"
"spotcat, I agree with you, it is sad to have to cancel and I do not consider myself pribilged either, hard work and sacrifices have enabled our lives. We help in the states, our area of Mexico and PV as well. I survived2travel and plan to do so as soon as feasible. I am all in for lock down for good of all but long term till a possible vaccine..nope. Quality of life is my priority not quantity. Hope to see you again in PV Spotcat!"
"I agree with Condu, but have a slightly different take on that. Bezerk, it's always a pleasure to see you. I'd love to go back to Velas. I didn't think I'd enjoy an AI as much as I did. On the other hand, we have eight weeks to use at Lindo Mar."
"i was whining about missing pv, maybe missing bermuda(july), savannah(aug).---then i got this horrific news.a friend of mine's sister has been in the hospital for 2 months with influenza a. she has been in a induced coma for 3 weeks, has kidney failure, and sepsis. she is 39 with 2 kids. today the family had to make the decision to amputate both arms and both legs in order that she lives. i've been sick about this all day. imagine waking up to that.it's hard about trips we wait all year for but this really puts things in a new perspective for me."
"Iyam, I'm beyond sorry to hear that. My heart goes out to your friend and her family."
"I surely hope you get to use each and every week at Lindo Mar, spotcat. Yes I love Velas as you know but we can still hook up if in PV at same time, hopefully that happens, sooner rather than later.;)"
"TA needs a ""like"" or a ""love"" button."
"iyam. OMG, my heart aches reading your post. So very very sorry for your friend and family."
"iyam, Absolutely everything else pales after hearing about your friend. I am so sorry. That’s is an awfully hard decision for the family to make. My heart goes out to them."
I cancelled my two weeks at Garza Blanca for March 7 to 21. Wonder if we could recoup the reservation fees?
"luvs2travel2009, at a minimum you should be able to get reservation for another time. Almost everywhere offers some form of compensation now. Maybe not cash refund but who knows."
"thank you all---my stomach was in a knot all day. can you imagine!!good thing my tv ""broke"" and i worked on it for an hour--kept my mind busy. now i;m knotted up again"
"Spotcat, I was referring to myself not you. I have to remind myself how lucky that I am. Yes, hard work! Decades of 18 hour days & a lot of luck provided provided my husband & I with the income to take early retirement and to travel extensively. But, I know so many people that were not as lucky even though they worked just as hard & long. I think of the women & men in Mexico, SE Asia, South & Central America, and even friends in Canada & the USA that worked so hard to put food on the table & shelter for their families. Some of them are still working in their senior years! Would I love to safely take a plane and have a holiday? You bet! But, when I feel depressed at the present state of things, I think how ""privileged"" that I am & I feel truly blessed.:)"
yams- my heart is breaking for you about your friend's sister - it sure puts things in perspective! i pray that people who plan on spending their money to come here rethink & plan on spending their money to send to the poor Mexicans here that are in such need.
We were due to leave on Apr. 25th for three weeks atthe Lindo Mar. A real disappointment! Most of all not being able to see our wonderful friends like Spotcat and many others. We will be going in Nov. as we always do as well. I hope everything is back to normal by then.
Iyam: I just read your post about your sister's friend. That is truly one of the saddest posts that I have seen. I feel your pain...
My cancelled Garza Blanca was about $700 in RCI fees.
