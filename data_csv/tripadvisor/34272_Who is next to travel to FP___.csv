Anyone else besides Tim heading there in the next week???
Wasn't Yesh traveling really quick too? When is Cupcake leaving?
I’m hoping to be leaving for Paris on Wednesday and Tahiti on Thursday x
Woo hoo Yesh! I can't wait until your countdown!!We have 2.5 weeks now!! finally getting excited as people are actually leaving and FP is really open!!
"Meeeee! I leave Aug 1. I've repacked my bag twice already. Ugh, the suspense! :-)Oh. You said next week. My departure is in 2 weeks. That's still soon to me though LOLEdited: 6:09 am, July 17, 2020 "
12 and a wakeup for me
"We leave a week from tomorrow, on Saturday the 25th. Staying a week at Four Seasons and then ending with a week at The Brando. My biggest fear is if the US doesn't slow this down and they end up re-closing things while we are away. Will ATN continue with their schedule as is for a while or will we be forced to leave early on a few final flights? I need this get-a-way soooooo badly...my husband calls it my ""happy place""! :)"
SoA-We are a bit concerned about the same thing being stuck there. (But man what other place in the world would we rather be stuck in?)But I believe we could get out if need be.
We are supposed to leave Wednesday!!!! I'm still freaking out about covid testing time frame and the fact I have no place to stay for 3 nights in moorea! The Hilton is working on shifting our reservation to the sofitel but I'm so nervous it won't work out! If I dont hear back by tomorrow I'll just book on my own.
SMK - I would think the HIlton Moorea will come through for you! It looks like they open back up on August 11th.I hope the Sofitel is amazing!18 days and counting...
"I'll be monitoring this post closely as we are not going till September. I'm so thankful and grateful to all of you leading the way. So a great big thank you. Safe travels, stay well, stay safe and healthy."
Same here! I have an early September trip date. I am SO appreciative of everyone who is sharing their experience and information on this site. You guys are awesome!
DW and I are also going in early September (fingers crossed)
"That might be us, leaving Monday night :-)"
travelerspur and so_a - what are your travel plans??? I'm so excited! We are going to Moorea Thursday for 3 nights (location still tbd haha) and then Bora Bora for 4 nights (Intercontinental).
"Travelur - Have a fantastic trip. I am assuming you already got your results back?If you get a chance, please let us know how the airport was (crowded, people social distancing), how the plane was (super crowded, people spaced out?) and how all the islands are (crowds, food, tours, social distancing, resorts back up and running well? etc.!!Thank you. i17 days"
"SMK, our plan is similar to yours, Moorea for 3 nights then Bora bora and Tikehau. Very exciting too!! Have you finalized your moorea hotel? Suel, will sure do. I am a little curious on how the air travel works now, and wondering if there will be more or less people visiting FP because of the pandemic (less travel) or the pandemic (Americans don't have much choice but FP)..."
We had our tests today in London (the throat one was fine but the nasal one was NOT fun!) we got the results back in 3 hours - both negative thank God! We have completed out ETIS. We fly to Paris on Wednesday morning and hopefully over to Tahiti on the 23rd July. Fingers and everything crossed!!
"Thanks so much everyone for keeping us all in the loop! Good luck and enjoy, yesh24! Best of luck to you all and safe travels!"
Yesh congrats!!!!! I'm still waiting for ours!!! Oh and still no place to stay with hilton relocating us. Hahaha
"At Tom Bradley waiting for Boarding now. Same as Tim previous experienced, the international terminal is quiet and not many people. Domestic terminal is more packed, feels like old days. Fortunately almost everyone is wearing mask, and it’s still easy to find a empty place in front of another gate to avoid the crowds."
"Congrats Yesh!!! 3 hours is amazingly fast, is it typical turnaround for PCR test in UK?"
"Thanks everyone. No, we had to pay (quite a lot!) to go to a clinic that has a lab on the site so they can guarantee a 24 hour turnaround. When I explained to the doctor I’m not packing until I get the result, she said she would go to the lab with the tests as soon as we left . So they say it’s between 65 minutes to 24 hours. So we got the lab results that say Target: SARS COV2 rt PCR and result says ‘not detected’ Then we also have a separate doctors letter/medical certificate that explains the lab results and says in big capital letters that the test in Negative. I’m hoping that is fine!"
"SMK: in a little disappointed in the Hilton. They still haven’t got back to us say if they were able to relocate us. Luckily, I booked the Sofitel myself so I emailed the Hilton last night telling them to cancel my reservation. Hope yours works out ok xx"
I agree Yesh! We booked ours through Costco and when Ait Tahiti extended our trip by a day we booked an additional one night on our own. Hilton was the only one to inform me about the change bc I had the one night booked through them. To date I have called Costco 8 times about it over 9 days and NOTHING. Now that being said around midnight last night I finally got an email from Hilton with confirmation at Sofitel.It took 10 days and finally 48 hours before my departure. I need a beach asap! ;)
I had the same experience with the Hilton. They told me they were waiting for the Sofitel to respond to them; I gave them 4 days and heard nothing. I ended up just emailing the Hilton refund everything and then rebooked on my own. Definitely not great service.
"SMK and Travelsur - Did you guys do your COVID test at reliant urgent care? How much in advance did you book your test at the location?Edited: 4:40 pm, July 21, 2020 "
Travelsur - So Exciting! You are almost there!! I can't wait to hear about everything!Yesh - Have a smooth flight tomorrow!! Please post pics on the FB page!SMK - I can't believe the Hilton has not figured out where you will stay??? What the heck? What do they say to you when you ask?
Jyotsna - I was reading tonight that Reliant is no longer working with ATN for Covid tests . They are now recommending a different place.There seem to be quite a few people who have already made appointments and paid at Reliant so hopefully they will honor those.
"SMK - Oh, it sounds like the Hilton answered you. I hope the Sofitel is awesome and you get a chance to relax and rejuvinate. God knows we all need it!!!"
Suel - Yes I did see that. I am booked for Stanford like you are but they are now saying it could take upto 72-96 hours! Which is why I was inquiring about LA tests now..
"Jyotsna - Hi, I just responded."
Jyotsna I took the test locally in Dallas.
"Hmmm, testing seems more complicated now. If the new clinic works like Reliant, it should guarantee the result be back in time for flight. Make sure the result paper says “PCR”, as that is what the ATN flight attendant is looking for, unless it is from the clinic they assigned. We headed to Moorea right after landing. So beautiful!!! Worth going through the troubles..."
"SMK - I'm in Dallas and going to Tahiti in late August, can you tell me where you took the test in Dallas and got results back within 72 hours?"
Travelsur2 - where are you guys staying in Moorea? How is the weather? Someone was saying it was not good in Bora Bora yesterday?Have the time of your life!!!
"Thank you Sue. Weather in Moorea couldn’t be better! Sunny all day with a little breeze here and there. Makes your outdoor lunch very enjoyable. Warm air but not sticky. May need a long sleeve at night or early in the morning, Local people are very happy to see tourist coming back."
"Nirav - We went to The Colony ER off of 121/423 however if you are traveling on a flight that allows testing M-F then I would also suggest Passport Health in Plano. Appointments, no long waiting (I was in the car for 3 hours at the ER location), no lying about symptoms, etc. THe only issue with them is that they do not (or did not at the time) offer Sunday service and a lot of places that are open on the weekend will not send them to the labs until Monday evening. (Our flight out is today - a Wednesday which was why that mattered since Sunday was in our 3 day window)Edited: 12:17 am, July 23, 2020 "
"Hi all, an update from me: we have checked in for our flight to Tahiti from Paris after a lot of thorough checks! We arrived in Paris the day before and barricaded ourselves in the hotel room for the whole day. Check in was manic: there were so many people checking in for the Tahiti flight from Paris. They check your temperature first (anything above 37.5 and you can’t board) while you’re queuing and put a sticker on your passport if you’re good to go. You then have your ETIS checked and the PCR Test. The guy who checked us in spent a LONG time checking all our documents. They also check that you have your ETA/visa for Canada. If anyone is flying from Paris , you have to print of your confirmation of your Canadian visa. People were turned away because they had not done this. A few other people where turned away because the paperwork for Covid results didn’t say PCR on them anywhere. We are waiting to board now and will update on the other end."
SMK - Thank you very much for sharing the locations. Our flight is on a Friday night so hopefully my wife and I can schedule our appointment withe Passport Health. Can you share what your turnaround time was for the results?
