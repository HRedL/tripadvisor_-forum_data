Thanks Tony!
"Anthony, those graphs are for the whole of Catalonia, not specifically Barcelona.There was a map with statistics by municipality on www.Ara.cat but I can't seem to find it. If anyone does, please post."
Is 72 cases in Barcelona accurate?https:/…barcelona
"Roxy rEven if I were only visiting one City, usually I visit Barcelona and stay in Sitges, I would be more interested in the circumstances affecting a whole region.Keep wellAnthony K"
"@Moonietravel, no, unfortunately 72 total cases in Barcelona is not accurate. We wish it was so low. Last updated official data shows 11.900 confirmed cases in the city so far, 187 new cases since yesterday:https:/…Edited: 9:40 am, May 03, 2020 "
"Just curious, why is important for you to know?Edited: 9:45 am, May 03, 2020 "
"http://aquas.gencat.cat/ca/actualitat/ultimes-dades-coronavirus/index.html#googtrans(ca|en) This would be the official website from the Catalan government. You can explore by ""health region"" and by ""municipality"" -which do not necessarily mean the same. The current figures for Barcelona (May 2nd) is: 32000 suspicious cases, 16000 confirmed, total population 1,6 million."
Thanks Enric ... I wish you and your family rude health.CheersAnthony K
