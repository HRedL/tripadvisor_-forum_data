"hye, im from malaysia. i am planing to visit pakistan on august crossing Via wahga border from india. my question is, does the pakistan E-visa valid for wagah border crossing? please advise."
"Hi Ija , Yes its applicable on Wagah border crossing too . Currently the e-visa application form has the following land entry points as you have asked about the border crossing : Wagha Land RouteWagha Railway StationChamman Land RouteTorkham Land RouteTaftan Land Route Sost Land Route Happy Travels !Edited: 1 year ago "
yes good question and just to add ... e visa works from India to Pakistan (land crossings) and will work in reverse provided it is not your initial entry into India. (You must make your first entry into India via a designated airport or seaport.) Your re-entry to India can be done by land.
Or you'd need double entry for India.
The Indian e visa these days is double entry for the designated period Imran but good point.Air Asia flies to Amritsar so it is another way to start a Pakistan trip.Another quirk of the Indian e visa is that you can stay in India for sixty days on each entry. Thus by adding a trip to Lahore you can effectively extend your Indian trip to a maximum of 120 days if desired.

I have a 365 day Indian e-visa with multiple entry. On the e-visa it lists (primarily airports/ports) by name. If I cross Wagah border crossing by land into Pakistan can I return to India via Wagah crossing 2 days later with my Indian tourist e-visa? I am US citizen.
.. second or third entry can be at land border .. only the first entry when you receive the India visa in your passport must be at an airport or sea.The real question .. why only 2 days in Pakistan !
"hi Ija, Just wanted to check whether you successfully reentered India via the Wagah border using your e-visa. I'm about to go on a similar trip but just realised the small print below my Indian e-visa on the valid entry points so im kinda worried i wont be able to reenter India now:Applicant can arrive at 28 e-Visa designated airports i.e. Ahmedabad , Amritsar , Bagdogra , Bengaluru , Bhubaneshwar ,Calicut , Chandigarh , Chennai , Cochin , Coimbatore , Delhi , Gaya , Goa , Guwahati , Hyderabad , Jaipur , Kolkata , Lucknow, Madurai , Mangalore , Mumbai , Nagpur , Portblair , Pune , Tiruchirapalli , Trivandrum , Varanasi , Vishakhapatnam and 5designated seaports (i.e. Chennai , Cochin , Goa , Mangalore , Mumbai ). However, he/she can depart from any of theauthorized Immigration Check Posts in India."
The ‘e-Visa designated’ is only for first entry when visa is stamped in passport. Then visa is in passport and no longer an ‘e’ There have been confirmed reports of re-entry to India at Wagah.
"Dear readers, I,m a UK citizen and planing an overland to India will I be okay to travel with an E-visa through Wagah border, and then into Attarri India on an E-visa...?I,v got the carnet and visa,s all in order, apart from the above..?"
You can enter and exit Pakistan with a Pakistan E-visa .. but you can not have first entry to India with an India E-visa.Confusing thread because some questions are for Pakistan E-visa and some are for India E-visa
"Hi, I would like to ask regarding the India Evisa for 30days double entry. Does the India evisa are allowed if I do the land crossing from Amritsar to Pakistan? Fyi, I will fly from Kul to Amritsar and cross via Waghah border to Pakistan. Or do I need to go to embassy instead? Thank you!"
"Hi Zatayumni, I would like to ask the same question as you. Is it possible to apply for India Evisa 30days double entry since planning to cross via Waghah border from Amritsar to Pakistan. Does the India Evisa valid for land crossing? Planning to visit on April next year."
"With Indian E-visa can fly (first entry) to Amritsar, and exit land-crossing to Pakistan, and return land-crossing (second entry) back to Amritsar.Get the Indian 1 year or 5 year E-visa (not 30 days) for greater flexibility.Pakistan E-visa can be used to enter at land-crossing.Edited: 6:09 am, December 28, 2019 "
"Howzit from RSA!Can you clarify how you are aware of this? I have today been informed by the Indian gov website advising on visas that returning via Attari is not possible.I need to be certain because I am planning to visit Lahore for four days in July from Amritsar on e-visas with both countries, but need to ensure I can get back into India Thank you!"
