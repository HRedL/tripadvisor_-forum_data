"I apologize if this has been asked before, I searched and did not find the answer.With the new CDC guidelines for level 3 travel stating that all travelers will need to do a 14 day isolation at home post trip, is this enough of a case for travel insurance to pay?I have a regular travel insurance policy, not 'cancel at any time' insurance,and my work as well as the CDC has now put a post quarantine on our trip, making it impossible for us to go on our planned trip in a few weeks.I submitted a claim for our airline tickets but wonder if they will cover.Anyone else have luck having a claim covered?I have called the travel insurance company, the airline and expedia, no clear answer, flight is not cancelled yet so no refund. https:/…after-travel-precautions.html"
Most travel insurance companies have a message regarding the COVID-2019 outbreak on their website that answers many of the commonly asked questions. Be aware that most travel insurance policies don't cover trip cancellation claims due to epidemics or fear of travel. This may vary due to your local state or country laws and regulations and by which trip insurance plan / policy you purchased. It is best to review your policy to see what is covered.
"I have been. AIG still not updated and general statements, they told me to submit a claim, which. I did. Just wonder if anyone has specific experience over the past 1-2 weeks."
"Where did you see this? ""With the new CDC guidelines for level 3 travel stating that all travelers will need to do a 14 day isolation at home post trip, is this enough of a case for travel insurance to pay?"" From CDC website: https:/…coronavirus-italy -- these are recommendations , not mandates so I'm not sure travel insurance will cover for this (or, even if this is mandated) - it depends on your policy and wha it does/does not cover.There is no language stating travelers ""need to"" do so - Have you read that somewhere?"

"Travelers should stay home for 14 days after returning to the United States and practice social distancing.From guidelines. Which are used by all schools and my employer as it’s come from government guidelines , adding a 14 day ‘extended home vacation’ which I can’t do. I know I’m not alone here, just wondering what others are doing to try to recoup funds."
"depends on your travel insurance. but we had comphrensive insurance we took out in June 2019 last year. our insurance company wont cover for us to cancel, they wont cover 14 day isolation as an exclusion is government intervention and they said that is a governement request. they now wont cover for any coronavirus claims for travel after 28 feb, as it is a known event. basically they get out of it all and we are left with a five figure loss."
"To #4 Yes. thank you for the link. Still doesn’t seem clear but worth filing a claim.Crazy that they will pay if you contract the virus or get stuck, but don’t want to pay to prevent it.Edited: 3:19 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"following, thank you to all for your informative posts (in same boat, no idea)"
"nzp0ppy-I’m so sorry for you guys. The whole situation stinks- and my heart goes out to the Italian people who are suffering and losing business.The bottom line in this is that you’re screwed no matter what you chose. I made the decision not to go before our final hotel deposits were due, just seeing the direction of things last week I knew it would be weeks to months for things to settle. So we’re out a few thousand dollars like many others, maybe we’ll get something back for following local and federal guidelines! I’ll keep pursuing the travel insurance route, but I don’t have high hopes."
