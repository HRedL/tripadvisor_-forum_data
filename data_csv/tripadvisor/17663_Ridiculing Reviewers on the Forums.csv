"I did not want to hijack the thread on reviewing reviewers but a related issue was raised there that definitely merits considering. All too often reviewers get ridiculed in the forums for their reviews and IMO those threads should be closed before they get out of hand. As it is, typically they’re allowed to go on for pages and pages, and I’m ashamed to say, I’ve chimed in on some then felt bad and wished that I hadn’t. Frequently a quote is taken out of context and gives a different meaning to the original point, and really, the sole purpose seems to be to get a laugh, or to cheerlead for a particular resort. To me, the whole beauty of TA is the diversity of its posters and the diversity of those posters’ experiences. People should be allowed to voice their opinion regardless of how “petty” or “silly” it may strike other posters, without being ridiculed on the forum.I realize moderators cannot be there 24/7 but is there any way to get these threads closed? Reporting it doesn’t always get results as the automated system needs several such reports."
"You can always use ""Contact us"" on this page from Help Center:tripadvisor.com/help/are_the_forums_managed_…FYI - there is a link to Help Center at the bottom of every page."
"I assume you are talking about D.Fs. I think trip advisor has been doing a good job with the help forums. I could never get why ""stuff"" happens on the D.Fs because it hurts that whole piticular areas businesses. In my area the D.Es seem to do a good job keeping it helpful- but i understand other areas have issues."
"Yes, I meant the various destination forums. Not all do it but some are particularly prone to them. It's not like it's an epidemic, lol, but it is something that could have a discouraging effect on posting honest reviews."
"TravelerNewYork,I agree, and I don't believe that targeting specific reviews/reviewers on forums is not allowed. I have reported many of these posts and they are usually taken down quite quickly. You should report them.Having said that I was unable to find a specific Help Center page or a part of the forum guidelines that addresses the issue of criticizing reviews and reviewers on the destination forums. It'll be great if TripAdvisor Staff (or another member) could point me to what part of the forum guidelines covers this, or if non-existant or lacking clarity, TripAdvisor would consider adding a sentence to the current guidelines.Silvia"
"TNYLike you I have also joined in a couple of these threads but like you I do wish TA would quickly pull the plug on them as they can quickly spiral out of control and as you say turn into page after page as people battle it out. They also have the ability to suck people in form other forums which proves to me that some things on TA are orchestratedWe all have different holiday measuring sticks and expectation and I do feel sorry for anyone who does not have a great tripIt is also not just reviews that are dissected as I have had personal experience of ""live from"" threads being targeted"
"I think the section of the forum guidelines that applies is this one:""Harassment of other members will not be tolerated.""TripAdvisor encourages active discussions in our forums, even those about controversial topics, but the forums can only flourish if all members feel welcome and safe. If you can't offer friendly advice to a fellow traveler, it may be wiser to move along to the next thread.""We will not tolerate:""Argumentative, off-topic exchanges""***Multiple messages targeting any member(s) for insults, attacks, or personal comments""Challenges to another member's right to participate on our site""Sarcastic asides and snide comments***""tripadvisor.ca/help/what_are_the_guidelines_… (***emphasis*** added by me)"
"Fliflop_man,I find the ""Live from"" threads terribly tedious and don't read them. It's more like a dairy entry of a members' experience and not necessarily bound to a experience with a single business (it may also cover tours, etc.) in my view, a member who decides to do an ""life from"" thread is opening the forum for discussion of his opinions, and it should be quite clear that other members may disagree and post back. It's a forum entry after all.A review is not open to discussion but a statement of the reviewers' experience at a particular point in time. I see a difference here in terms of the members' intention when posting a review or a live from thread. Silvia"
"Thanks, CW. I thought about that part of the forum guidelines, but are not specific to reviews -- they seem to be more target to forum posts.Many times the criticism of reviews are not in the forum of ""insults"" just dissecting every single statement the review has covered and expressing strong disagreements.I may be wrong, but even without the lack of insults, to see that your review has been picked out of many other reviews, is being looked at and discussed in a forum expressing strong disagreements with the reviewers views would be quite disturbing to the reviewer.In my view, while the content of reviews in general can be discussed on the forums, picking a single review out of hundred to present your arguments against it, it's just down right not nice.Maybe, like you say, the harassment part of the guidelines do apply.SilviaEdited: 8 years ago "
"SilviaI party agree but ""live from"" threads can be a great source of information for people and many people do enjoy reading them. It allows those people who wish up to date information to get it within 24 hours or soTo go back to reviews I think the great shame is that very often the reviewer has no idea their review is being ripped apart on the forumEdited: 8 years ago "
"A lot of those threads start off innocently enough – “is it true that …”, “has anyone else had this problem …”. In that regard I think these types of questions are valid for a forum discussion. Since many forum followers do not post reviews, it is a way to solicit recent experiences from fellow travelers that may shed light on the issue being reported in the review. I agree that they often evolve into an analysis of the reviewer rather than the place being reviewed, but I think squashing the thread quickly is not justified."
"Re: Post #6. I've seen these guidelines pushed to the limit and, at times, ignored. General statement: Some poor poster asks a guestion, maybe about a review, and then it gets picked away (the reviewer is basically being attacked) and it reflects very badly on the forums. I start feeling embarassed (don't really know why). This happens on some of the destination forums and non-destination forums. There are forums I now avoid as the ""culture"" of the forum is making rude and snide comments and trying to make the poster feel basically stupid. There are ways to say things and ways to say things.Occasionally a contributing factor can be if a poster (who happens to be an Owner) wear two hats and over-identifies with the owner perspective. Maybe some of these discussions happen in the Owner Forum (I have no idea) but it doesn't belong elsewhere, IMHO. I've seen situations where it seems like people are talking behind the poster's back on the public forum even though the poster is a participant on their own thread. (Tres uncomfortable).It's not appropriate to dissect the post/review. That is not why the person wrote in to begin with and the thread is then highjacked and degenerates unless steps are quickly taken to stop that from happening.Ridiculing reviewers says way more about the ridiculer than the poster. It reflects badly on the person who is doing it and also, on a group that's encouraging it. The posters who experience this basically say that they are never returning to the forum and then are called ""thin-skinned"". I hope that I haven't taken this off-topic. I guess I'll find out if this is deleted. I really support the posting guidelines and wish they were more consistently followed. Sorry to be so long-winded and I apologize if this is off-topic.L4Edited: 8 years ago "
"""""Sarcastic asides and snide comments***""Thanks, CW, I think this would cover what I mean. The thread starts off with a ""Hey, did you see that review where..."" and everyone chimes in with something snarky or sarcastic. If I were the reviewer I'd be mortified and it just may stop me from participating. I realize it can be reported, but as I said, unless several others report it as well, one report will not result in anything. It just strikes me as very mean-spirited when everyone tries to outdo each other with clever posts. And Luckyfour, I don't think you were off topic."
Try the Las Vegas forum sometime-- it can get rather nasty over there.
"The solution is simple""stay off the forums.Do some travelling.I doubt if many reviewers have the time or the incentive to participate in the forums..I.ll stick with the reviews for now as I think there absolutely brilliant.But as for these forums I will leave that to you Experts. DF's DE,s,IMO.s REALLY haha"
