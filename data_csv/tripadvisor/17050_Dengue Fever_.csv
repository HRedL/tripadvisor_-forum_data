"I'm planning a trip to Kaoshiung in a few weeks, and need to stop in Tainan (though we can stay in the car the whole time). Is anyone currently in this area or just visited and have info on just how bad the dengue fever situation is right now? Thanks in advance!"
"As of today, the Dengue Fever in Tainan is not yet under control and Kaoshiung also sees a lot of new patients. That doesn't automatically mean you will get it if you visit the area, but I would suggest against visiting Tainan and Kaoshiung before December."
OK -- thank you for the advice!
"We are hoping that the epidermic would get under control by the winter months but one never knows, as it is really getting out of hand. I would advice avoiding Tainan , and even Kaoshiong altogether."

"When are you coming? By November the situation might be get control. If you are coming Tainan, you can check here for information: https://www.facebook.com/amazingtainan and you can also find some hospitable locals who can speak English to walk with you around the city."
Thanks for the replies everyone. I'm still deciding... The trip is planned for a week from now. Seems like it has been difficult to contain.Edited: 4 years ago 
I will be visiting Kaohsiung and Tainan in October 15. Please advice do I change my itinerary. I will be coming from Kaohsiung and will be staying a night at Tainan on 13 October 15 and next day will do Tainan after that will leave for Alishan.
"The morbidity rate is escalating still, best to abort travel plans to the south for now."
As of today the recent dengue fever epidemic in Tainan has killed more people in Taiwan than SARS.
