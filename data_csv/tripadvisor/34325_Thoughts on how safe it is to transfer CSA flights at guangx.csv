Feb 26 and March 9? International flights
What do yo mean?
"We have same issue, changing flights at Guangzhou before continuing to Vietnam. So far flights are still going but no idea by the tine we travel on 14th Feb from London"
"I will be transiting through Guangzhou on 27-28 Feb and 16 Mar. I spoke to the local office of China Southern a few days ago and they advised that flights through Guangzhou are operating normally and there is no expectation of any change ""anytime soon"". They have suggested that I keep checking with them.However, it has occurred to me that rather than there being cancellation of flights, the greater risk may be that the countries that are the final destinations of CZ flights may impose restrictions on the movements of passengers who have arrived on flights that have originated in China. I can't see that happening in the next couple of weeks, but who knows what the situation might be in a month's time?"
"I also plan to travel by the end of March. Everything booked. At the moment no one knows what would happen by then. My personal advice is:- If you are REALLY worried, cancel or change your flights.- If not, buy a travel insurance which make you feel better. That's what I did.If you are transferring flight in China in the coming months, wear mask, be careful of personal hygiene.Travel safe"
"The Philippines’ Bureau of Immigration will temporarily stop issuing tourist visas on arrival to Chinese nationals to help ensure the country remained free of the new coronavirus, its head said on Tuesday.“We are taking this proactive measure to slow down travel, and possibly help prevent the entry of the 2019-nCov,” Jaime Morente, the bureau’s commissioner said in a statement.The virus outbreak, which began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December, has infected more than 4,000 people in China and killed more than 100."
"The situation is likely to worsen for awhile, but might improve (or not) by the end of the month. Airport transfers are not likely to be the highest risk, since airports are sanitized and passengers are checked for fever. It's impossible to know what the risk will be. If I were doing this today, I would wear a face mask and use hand sanitizer frequently to reduce risk."
"I've got a similar sticky issue. I'm connecting to Japan in PVG - if I have to cancel the entire trip (not good as this is a bit of a trip of a lifetime) I am covered by my insurance for what I have paid so far.However the issue is that I have not yet booked hotels in Japan, and I suspect as my planned trip currently transits a region that the UK FCO advise against all but essential travel to, I can not safely book Japan hotels and still have them covered.Any ideas for how best to proceed? I have asked my insurer if they will cover the difference between my current routing and one transiting in HKG but this seems an unusual situation and I have my doubts that this would be covered."
".>> I can not safely book Japan hotels and still have them covered.Not related to China/Guangzhou but vast majority of Japanese hotels do not require prepayment or credit card information at time of booking, and can be cancelled as late as 6pm check-in time. Most Japanese hotels do not even offer prepaid rates at all.Your cancellation penalty is zero for these hotels. They do charge for no-show if you don't cancel by the deadline.Edited: 5:42 pm, January 28, 2020 "
"This is good to know, thank you!"
