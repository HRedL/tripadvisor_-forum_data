Hi Does anyone know of a UK travel agent that sells package deals to Secrets Siversands? Thanks :)
Apparently Virgin and Monarch do but you could try carribeanwarehouse.co.uk or something similar?
Could try beaches4less.co.uk as well ask for nick
cheers
I also not for Caribbean Warehouse - great company
"Is it not possible to put your own package together from the UK - i.e. book a flight, make the hotel reservations and arrange the ground transfers yourself? I do it all the time from Canada and save myself a bundle.Edited: 9 years ago "
"Hi llisaSure and many peolple possibly do, but in the UK the consumer protection is greater if you buy it from a UK tour operator or travel agent."
"Lisa As the previous poster has said you certainly can and you can also use ""packagers"" like Caribbean Warehouse who as well as selling package deals will also arrange the accommodation and flights, etc separately for you to give you more flexibility on dates of travel and multiple destination trips"
"Aaaah, I forgot about the consumer protection bit (ABTA?).FWIW, expedia.ca is registered in Ontario, the only Canadian province I'm aware of that offers similar consumer protection (TICO). When I book with expedia, even though I'm in Alberta, I get this coverage. Following the same logic, I wonder if you'd be covered if you booked though expedia.co.uk."
LisaThey are ATOL protected
"Thanks so much folks - as some of you have said the package gives you more protection, Plus we are hoping to go in December when the weather is bad in the UK, especially with the airport closures last year and companies going bust, just want to be as covered as possible. I have checked out the cost of hotel and flights ie booking seperate however seems to work out more. Will try your suggested travel companies. :)"
Try www.caribeancollection we book with them all the time and they are fab :)
"i would opt for caribbeanwarehouse over caribbeancollection.During the volcanic ash and swine flu periods, caribbeancollection were notoriously bad at granting people refunds and generally not very helpful at all, whereas caribbeanwarehouse were the complete opposite."
I concur with lolaThey were also abysmal during the swine flu epidemic as well
