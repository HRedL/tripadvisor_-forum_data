"That was 3 days ago. It's right on the OR/WA border. Central OR, not the coast. Only about 45 min from me, so I'm surprised we haven't had any confirmed cases.Edited: 5:26 pm, March 05, 2020 "
It reopened yesterday.
This was posted in the wrong forum.
The scariest issue with this closure is does it set a precedent. Does a casino that doesn't close when an employee has the virus not show an abundance of caution. I would think that they PR and Legal departments are working overtime on the right response.
"Are we going to have people posting here about the virus in every other place on earth, including LV?"
FLW...ain't that what you just did ?
