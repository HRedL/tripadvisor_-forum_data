"Will the observation deck of the Empire State Building, The Edge at Hudson Yards, and the New York Aquarium remained closed when New York City enters Phase 4 on Monday since a change in opening plans have been announced and the attractions mentioned were planning to reopen that day. Also, will the Statue of Liberty Museum and Ellis Island Immigration Museum that were planning to reopen on Monday still do so, since they are run by the federal government."
"If you want to know if an attraction is opening, you should visit its website. Just because a business or attraction may open under a particular phase doesn't mean it will open."
"There has been no change in plans yet according to their websites from what I have been able to find.Edited: 10:29 pm, July 16, 2020 "
"Then you have your answer, though you should keep checking back as websites don't always get updated as rapidly as they ought to."
The Empire State Building is still on track to reopen on Monday though.https:/…3famp
Glad to see NYC doing soo well for now. Hopefully other states don't bring it back.
"The Statue of Liberty Museum and Ellis Island will now remain closed Monday according to the website, but the grounds of the Statue of Liberty will be reopening. Also, I have not seen any change in plans for the Empire State Building reopening July 20, so I guess it may have been already approved by both the city and state."
Way to go New York! Wish we were in your shoes.
The only indoor attraction that I know of reopening today is the Empire State Building Observatory Experience due to the new rules that ban many indoor attractions from reopening.
"Chicago is reinstitution some restrictions, including no inside bars, reducing table occupancy outside, and some other restrictions as well. Also trying to discourage indoor gatherings and parties."
Why is the Empire State Building able to reopen it's observatory experience when many other indoor attractions are not allowed to reopen.
Surely you now know more about this subject than anyone else posting here?
"That's an excellent question. I was just thinking about that. Museums, etc. are closed. Only outdoor places like zoos and botanical gardens have been allowed to open otherwise. And only outdoor parts of Statue of Liberty are open.Edited: 6:38 pm, July 21, 2020 "
"There have been cases of animals being infected with Covid-19, but I have not heard if they actually got sick."
"Fox, the Malayan tigers at The Bronx Zoo were symptomatic and that prompted testing of the tiger who first showed symptoms (dry coughing and wheezing):“On March 27, Nadia was seen coughing in her exhibit for the first time. By then the zoo had been closed 11 days. The next week her sister, Azul, two Amur tigers, and three African lions in a different facility looked sick.”“Nadia’s samples were sent to two veterinarian schools, at Cornell University and the University of Illinois, and also to the Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories, which confirmed SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes covid-19 in humans.”Apparently none of the Bronx zookeepers had symptoms but after this finding all zoos were advised to “consider giving more personal protection equipment to animal care staffers who work with cats”.https:/…"
How are the big cats doing 3 months later?
"Great question NT...“All eight cats continue to do well. They are behaving normally, eating well, and their coughing is greatly reduced.”The above comment is from the most recent update (April 22) that I could find https://newsroom.wcs.org/News-Releases/artic… ; hopefully no news is good news!Even National Geographic hasn’t commented beyond this https:/… .Edited: 9:16 am, July 22, 2020 "
"https:/…world-europe-53439263Spain ordered 100,000 minks to be destroyed after 87% tested positive for coronavirus. The Netherlands did the same."
"I would also want to know why the Empire State Building is able to be open when museums for example, must remain closed."
"The ESB has a state of the art air filtration system. It seems there are two ways the virus can spread through the air: 1) direct droplets from the mouth or nose of an infected person. Good social distancing should prevent this. 2) indirect droplets from an infected person that hang in stagnant indoor air for an extended period of time (possibly for hours). #2 seems to be the culprit in most superspreading events and is why indoor dining and bars remain closed. In theory, there are filtration systems that can prevent #2 from happening but they aren't cheap. So most places won't have them."
"Do museums like the Museum of the City of New York or the Metropolitan Museum of Art have advanced filtration systems like the Empire State Building.Edited: 1:27 am, July 27, 2020 "
"ESB is outside mate, not hard to find that out on google to answer your own question."
"Much of the Observatory Experience for the Empire State Building though is indoors, including the 102nd floor observation deck and it is still able to reopen."
Maybe you should report them to the Governor for inappropriate reopening.
"The opening of the Empire State Building was approved by the city and the state, and they are following guidelines issued by authorities."
