I don't want to be a nervous buzz killer....but has anyone heard if the seasonal outbreak of Dengue fever [I hear quite a few cases were reported in June & July ] has slowed down?  I know there are always somes cases in the Carribean and don't intend to be overly concerned.
"The ""epidemic"" is officially over.We don't have West Nile Virus or the Plague like there is in the States either :)"
You can get the latest info from the CDC or WHO websites. 
"Unfortunately, dengue fever is apparently still around in late November. See the post on sbhonline.com discussion forum. The victim is a physician, says that it's a nasty bug, but would have gone to St. Barts anyway -- he had a great time!"
"Not sure about that one, he hasn't been diagnosed. Haven't heard of a confirmed case in a while."
