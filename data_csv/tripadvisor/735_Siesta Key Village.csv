"Driving from far away for a week in early July. Curious on any reports of how people are distancing and keeping safe in the SK village area? Right now the plan is to order out and have groceries delivered, but would be nice to enjoy the village if we’re comfortable to do so. Thx."
"Coming from MD, you may want to check with the property because the case rate per 100,000 residents is higher than the acceptable rate."
"It’s a private house w a pool 2 blocks from the beach; not a multi tenant facility. Just curious about activity in the village itself. Sarasota Co has a lower rate than the county im coming from in MD, apples to apples."
We head there over the week of the 4th. We have similar concerns since the village itself isn’t real big and the sidewalks can get crowded. Hopefully people and businesses continue to follow protocol. Enjoy your stay!
Most people are not wearing masks or social distancing in Siesta Village.There are previous posts about servers not wearing masks in restaurants etc.Cases are rising in Sarasota County....they are considering making masks mandatory.I am not happy with the lack of consideration by people..www.heraldtribune.com~SRQgirl
"All the servers we encountered were wearing masks, along with a vast majority of shoppers at Publix. However, the lack of distancing, masks, etc., in the village was very disappointing. We did not feel safe in that environment and did not return for the rest of our trip. We had no intention of becoming a statistic."
"Thanks. Sort of what I was expecting but not hoping for. Most of our July trips there it’s not crowded anyhow but I’m guessing this year more people will want out and will not be taking precautions. Just want to hit a few restaurants but agreed, not worth it. Hoping grubhub/UberEats is a thing in Siesta Key."
Most restaurants in Sarasota have the servers wearing masks.A previous poster commented on the lack of masks in SK Village.No reason not to give the Sarasota places a try.Lots of options. www.dinesarasota.comThere were recommendations on a previous thread.~SRQgirl

We were in Sarasota/Bradenton last week not Siesta Key but was appalled at the lack of people under 50 not wearing masks. I can definitely see why the cases are rising in this area. At the Restaurants we ate at all employees were wearing there masks and dong cleaning so that was a positive when going out to eat.
Really disappointed to hear this. My entire family is slated to come down the first week of September but we're going to have to reconsider if the state can't get this under control. Wearing a mask really takes little effort and is a very minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of things. Let's all try and be responsible and courteous so we can enjoy this beautiful area.
Thanks
"we moved down here a couple of months ago and have been exploring up and down the coast. I have not been happy with how the general public is not following guidelines. Very few are social distancing and wearing masks. Some businesses are doing their part. You just need to be prepared to distance yourself and wear your masks and adjust your plans when necessary, to keep yourself safe. I have seen almost no one following the guidelines in Siesta Key...."
"Agree with above posters....we moved to Venice last July from Indy, and it is very scary how few people here have followed the CDC guidelines. There were many, many house parties during the March/April period in my neighborhood, the beaches are pretty busy, and lots of people walking into stores/restaurants unmasked. My family have remained basically at home except for essential trips for months...."
Florida has much to offer but there are way too many people down there that refuse to acknowledge Covid 19...could not consider a vacation down there and be comfortable.
"I’m hesitant to say this, but my gut feeling is that Covid-19 is going to be around for a long time."
"At least the rest of this year. I feel like happy talk about a vaccine has made some people complacent and presumptive that there will magically not only be a vaccine this year, but it will be widely available. Wearing a mask is not asking much, and, at least for now, it's the only way to turn this situation around."
"It is not just about the potential vaccine, it is about top leadership acting like this is a joke.I do not believe there will be a vaccine this year. FDA approval takes time and testing.Florida had more new cases yesterday than anywhere else in the countryWatch the news...people all across the country walk around with no masks...no social distancing.People come here on vacation now and leave all guidelines behind. Many young people everywhere think they are immune.Until masks are made mandatory, cases will rise.I only go out when necessary.Did I mention hurricane season will peak in August/September??? ~SRQgirl"
