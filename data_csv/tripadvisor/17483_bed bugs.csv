"are there bed bugs at the hilton garden inn, inner harbour??"
Only if you Red Sox fans bring them!!
this is not about the red sox or the baltimore sports teams but a serious concern about all hotels with this problem.
"Wow, no sense of humor, apparently. Call the hotel if you are worried."
The way the sox have been playing can you blame them for not having a sense of humor. (and I am a sox fan).
"bedbugregistry.com/hotel/MD/Baltimore/Hiltonâ€¦Take note, sites like this are just what people report, and you cannot be guaranteed that what is written is fact, or someone who is misinformed, or has a beef about something else.You will look up hotels all over and find reports. Aside from never traveling again, your best defense is to educate yourself on how to ""throw down"" a room upon arrival and determine if bed bugs are in there. It isn't difficult. Here is an excellent tutorial video that aired on NBC http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11877871/Put your luggage and personal belongings in the bathtub, check the beds and behind the headboards. (I pulled some off wall in NYC a few weeks ago just as described in the video.) If you see ANYTHING funny, go to the front desk and demand a new room. Don't forget to pack a flashlight!Edited: 9 years ago "
did call the hotel several times. they will not tell you they are having a problem.this site is for people with questions about travel and not a site for a person who spends his days lost in chat rooms. get a life my friend .
"""did call the hotel several times. they will not tell you they are having a problem.""OK...so if the hotel doesn't know, or won't tell, why would people here have more information than that? I could say ""I stayed there and didn't have bed bugs"" or someone else could say ""I stayed there and did have bed bugs"". How would you know who to believe?Follow the great advice given by ""jwhiteree"". Bed bugs can be anywhere these days, including in one room at one hotel but not in the other 300 rooms at the same property.I would be very surprised at any hotel telling someone on the phone that they had an infestation."
This sounds like a Yankee fan in disguise just trying to give Red Sox fans a bad name--- he says as he crawls his way of the chat room. Here is a website for the bedbug summit. http://www.nabedbugsummit2010.com/
I have not heard of many bed bugs cases in downtown hotels...yet. But it does sound like NYC and areas have a big problem.A friend of mine in DC has them and they are a pain in the neck but are detectable if you know how to look.Let us know what you find when you visit.
"Just curious --- having been a victim of bedbugs in Baltimore two years ago --- I'm wondering (redsox53) if there is a specific reason why you are asking?I think jwhiteree gave really good advice. In my case, it was at a BWI hotel in 10/08 (where I'd stayed several times before) and it ruined my week-long vacation. The hotel was moving me all over the place (room-to-room) and saying things like....*oh, that's just fuzz.* Not when I was getting bitten, it wasn't. I proved it to them with a roll of scotch tape --- taping the larva to a pillow case. I never saw an adult bedbug. They comp'd me all my meals for a week, without ever admitting they had a problem. They said nobody else had complained. I would have left the hotel completely but paid via Hotwire and couldn't afford a different hotel. Plus there was a bedbug problem in a local college then so I figured (if I left) I might just get stuck in another hotel with the same problem.The good news is --- they were in the process of a complete renovation already so they also threw away all their mattresses, lines, bed coverings, towels, etc. The WHOLE hotel. Plus, as part of the renovation, they replaced their flooring.Knowing they were renovating and they *appeared* to be doing something about it, I agreed to stay there again in 04/09. When I walked in, everyone recognized me from 6 months earlier. That blows my mind as I could not POSSIBLY have been the only person to complain but the stink I made, with visits to the desk (thus it was embarrassing to them while other guests were there), was evidently memorable.Bottom-line. There were ZERO problems the next time. No bedbugs and the entire staff was very nice to me. They didn't admit the problem the previous visit but they too seemed relieved to be rid of it. It was the Holiday Inn BWI, BTW, and the issue had been solved last year.I realize there is a problem in certain areas but as some indicate, there are things you can do to prevent the spread. I always avoid putting luggage on the bed but I like jwhite's suggestion of putting it in the bathtub (or at least the bathroom). I've stayed in 3 different hotels in the area since and no problem.Are you concerned about reports in the area (?) or did someone tell you something about that specific hotel? You say you called the hotel but did you also e-mail them (for a record) and tell them why you are concerned?Good luck. It's not fun so, like you, I tend to be very diligent on this issue in that area. Actually, any area lately which tends to be humid."
"So... I work with and stay in hotels frequently in my industry. To be totally honest with you, I haven't come into contact with a bed bug problem in Baltimore (or Washington, DC for that matter). I'm sure they exist in moderation, but I don't think we have an epidemic happening as they do in NYC. I don't know that helps to ease anyone's mind, but I hope it does."
"""I'm sure they exist in moderation, but I don't think we have an epidemic happening as they do in NYC. ""There is no more of an epidemic in New York City than there is in Baltimore. It's the latest media hype, bed bugs around every corner...Yes, there has been an increase. But somehow the vast majority of people are not encountering them.I guess I'm pressing my luck, I've been in hotels about 80 nights this year and never seen one, nor has anyone I know or travel with ever seen one."
"Just returned from 7 days of hotel stays (4 different locations), and so far so good...no bugs!I had a lot of anxiety, though! Do your homework and know what you're looking for. I pulled back the sheets and inspected mattresses at each/every location.In the seams, size of an apple seed, juveniles are yellow.I've heard putting your suitcases in the tub will prevent them from getting in.Didn't think that was valuable advice since that clothes I'd be wearing would go BACK into the suitcase!"
