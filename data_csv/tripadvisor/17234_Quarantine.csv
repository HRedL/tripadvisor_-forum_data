Other countries removed from exemption list but unfortunately Canaries not added back..
Added Brunei and Malaysia those big holiday destinations to the quarantine exemption list.. Absolute joke
Why is it a joke people travel for other reasons than holidays this is about more than holidays
"Spain has past UK in confirmed cases pushing UK down too 12th in WW ranking 310k & 308k & yesterday was Spain 4088 & UK 891 new casesEdited: 4:08 am, August 07, 2020 "
Spire. Take them blinkers off fgs!! It’s not all about you and your holidays. There is a business world out there too. .
"Baldy, yes a business world in regards to tourism etc. The industry has already made countless redundancies and many more will probably go under."
"I have an e-friend from a non-travel forum who is a Singaporean but lives and works in Malaysia. We kept in touch during the lockdowns in both out countries. Malaysia locked down early with very considerable restrictions - to the extent that he reckons the UK has, in comparision, just played with it. There is now a very low level of infection and the country is well prepared should there be a spike, not least because folk generally follow the rules and it has a well developed contact tracing service. He's hoping that he'll be able to resume business trips to the UK soon but is obviously concerned about risks from crowded airports and being on a plane for hours."
"Harters, i agree we just played at it really in comparison but i think Spain didnt, they had a hard lock down and they've spiked."
"Spire - I agree about Spain. Their lockdown seem much more akin to the Malaysian version than the British one. There's going to be spikes as soon as you relax restrictions - unless you're one of those countries, like New Zealand and Taiwan, which managed to pretty much eliminate the virus over the early period.. What's inportant is how spikes are dealt with. And how quickly. I'm saying that as someone who is now subject to the Greater Manchester restrictions - and fully support them."
"The uk and spain had different lockdowns as did a range of other countries.Spains lockdown however strict(on the surface) is for the history books now it does not help in any way in contolling current problems.Spain has restrictions on travel because of current serious problems they have and nothing to do with the current situation in the uk.Its time maybe for people to stop harking on about strict spanish lockdown,it clearly was not as sucessful as many make out.Edited: 6:49 am, August 07, 2020 "
"Have to disagree, Steve. History always teaches us something useful for the future. And it's the whole issue of the Spanish lockdown, whihc includes the current, and on-going, restrictions of the""new normal"". The issue being posed on this thread is a consideration of whether Malaysia should be taken off the UK quarantine list, whilst the Canaries isnt. Folk obviously have their own views about that. My view is that the current evidence is that Malaysia has the virus much more under control than Spain (including the islands). Maybe thta changes next week, next month, whenever, maybe never."
"Hello harters, looking at some of the infection rates in parts of spain in the 100's,200 even 300's per 100,000 its astonishing that spain seems to have learnt so little from experience of strict lockdown.Such rates would be considered a disaster in the uk, and yet people over and over again point to what a great job spain has and is doing whilst the uk has ""played at it""The current stats suggest otherwise.Setting up ""field hospitals"" in madrid, barcelona and elsewhere in the last week in readiness for the health system to start creaking does not sound to me like a country that has learnt too many lessons.All whilst spanish politicians whine about the uk's ""haste"" in introducing restrictions.All those spanish citizens from even the worst affected areas can currently move and travel wherever they want including its islands, the uk decision not to make exceptions to places like the canaries looks more astute everyday.Atb steveEdited: 9:52 am, August 07, 2020 "
"Maybe you should look at some uk stats, for example.Blackburn with Darwin 1114 per 100000Blackpool 773 per 100000Burnley 630 per 100000Chorley 595 per 100000Fylde 594 per 100000Pendle 807 per 100000Preston 941 per 100000And the list goes on....I'm in tenerife where the rate is 4 per 100000 and I have to self isolate when I go home tomorrow. Where I live is 594 per 100000 but you or anyone else can con on 'staycation' where I live with 140 times the infection rate of tenerife. Blatantly Boris and his cronies don't want people to go abroad and stay in uk to spend money there, it has nothing to do with anything else.There was and still is no need for tenerife to be included with spannish mainland, this is total bullsh1t."
"At #12, craig what do those figures represent, totals since the start of the epidemic, 14 day average of new infections or something else?Atb steve"
7 day numbers per 1000000
"Craig - could you please point me towards your data source. I've not come across the infection figures presented as a 7 day total, only a daily figure per 100k. The 7 day figure certainly seems more useful and I'd like to look up my borough.TIAEdited: 6:02 pm, August 16, 2020 "
"Good morning all. Except at weekends, a daily bulletin is published by public health Spain. This is last Fridays.https:/…Actualizacion_185_COVID-19.pdfTable 1 gives the figures by region. I would think that public health in the Canarias does the same by island and municipality."
Canary Islands do it daily including weekends.
Malaysia is also a holiday destination.Looking at the current situation - perhaps we didn't ' pay at it ' after all!
"Not sure I understand your Malaysia comment, David. A country with half the population of the UK yet only 9212 total recorded cases and only 125 deaths. If ever there was a country that, so far, has effectively dealt with the virus, then it's Malaysia."
I think David is referring to post 1
"Thanks Peter. That makes senseEdited: 9:56 am, August 17, 2020 "
"- Can anyone please tell me the entry requirements - the truth - in connection with Tenerife South Airport, what we can expect because of Covid?- Also I've just read about new mask rule like compulsory everywhere, what is the truth in Puerto de la Cruz?- Lago Martinez is still open? Mercadona in Martinez Centre?- In the UK we are allowed not to wear mask if we have a condition. I have. This is why I want to travel, bad allergy, mild asthma. I need the salty air breath in, the only reason I paid for this holiday. How can I be en medically exempt there? I can't breath in that wretched stuff, so far it was not compulsory on open places, how strict is the rule? A BIG thank you in advance."
"Catalan news reporting 15,500 cases since friday in spain and that germany are repatriating their citizens - situation has massively escalted it seems"
"Craig those were the stats as of the 2nd July im west lancs and we are nowhere near that anymore! there have been 6 new cases in the last week hereEdited: 2:17 pm, August 17, 2020 "
"Blackburn is 94.7 so yes still high but not over a 1000 per 100,000 - updated today https:/…blackburn-darwen-covid-figures"
Post 23 this was posted on Facebook this afternoon it was updated on Friday 14th and is from TourismTenerife https:/…
# 20 mmm . . . it is confusing. I think I was trying to say that travel to Malaysia comprised business and leisure and the situation can change very quickly.It is the fist Monday of the week - isn't it?
"Post 23 if you look on the Spanish tourism website it has all the requirements for entry there. What sort of allergy do you have? I am not sure if mild as a would qualify not wearing a mask even at home as know 2 people with it and they wear masks. Of course the other major point would be if you have something that puts you more at risk then a mask is a very good idea. You will also have to wear one at the airport and on the flight and I don’t think there are exceptions as flights would be deemed a choice and people are in close confines. When I was in Tenerife at the end of my winter break for the first week of Lockdown their they where very strict indeed and police all over the place making sure you stuck to the rules. Might be different now, maybe someone else has visited recently since the masks everywhere came in."
"Post #23 - Yes, the law is that mask wearing outside is compulsory under all circumstances, except for those with a medical condition which would be worsened by it. I presume that Spanish residents are able to get something along the lines of an exemption certificate from their doctor. I've Googled but have been unable to find anything about how a tourist gets a similar certificate.The way forward may be for you to email or phone the British Consulate in Santa Cruz and ask the question. Other than that, I could only suggest that you get a letter from your GP to take with you AND get it professionally translated into Spanish. You cannot expect, say, a police officer who may challenge you to be able to read English sufficiently well to understand a letter not in her/his own language. You can expect the authorities to treat mask wearing seriously, sa they have done with their restrictions throughout the crisis. I'm sure they will be alert to the possibility of people saying they have a medical condition just to avoid mask wearing - hence the need for proper evidence of a condition. By the by, I have COPD and wouldnt expect to be exempt in the UK.Edited: 9:49 am, August 18, 2020 "
"Mold, dust, EMF (if the radiation is high, I cough a lot, I get asthma attack when using mobile phone, especially bad in airports and plane, they are flight mode but on small area they still emitting radiation due to their screen), chemicals, other's perfume (some), some flowers. It usually comes from out of nowhere, suddenly.Besides this I have a childhood experience, I was attacked, someone tried to choke me and (I can't bear the feeling of dropped oxygen and something around my neck and face). That case can be proven easily as it was a crime, court and jail case documented. I also have a past with serious panic attacks, also documented, can be proven.GPs are not open here, even cancer patients must wait long to be treated., and I don't use them anyway because don't want side effects of a drug just to surpass symptoms, instead of trying to solve the situation like avoid things what can cause it. In past I paid a lot to go to Tenerife in every 2-3 months as to breath salty water (freely) in and swimming in it helped a lot, I was much better after that for weeks. I prefer natural solutions whenever possible. In a case of an asthma attack I drink water still it can be cough up. I wear EMF clothing when outside, use earthing sheet in hotels (mine).Anyway, thanks."
"By the way, to wear a mask with your condition is up to you, your choice but you really should not encourage others to wear one with conditions unless you wish to cause them harm. A lowered oxygen level can cause stroke, heart attack or 'just' fainting in and hitting yourself badly. And it is written on the masks that they don't protect against viruses, it means rules or laws you ruin yourself for basically nothing. But anyway, I can't bear to wear one longer than 1-2 minutes.How much is the penalty? What happens if I get caught?"
"Handz is right, they don't protect you against viruses, just bacteria, they are bad for your health if anything. I'm due to be there in April.. Definitely cancelling if the rule still applies, I'll be passing out all the walking I like to do! Load of rubbish"
"Hi peeps. The masks are to protect others from you, not the other way around. It is to stop your droplets landing on people of surfaces as you exhale, cough, sneeze, shout down your mobile etc etc. I know it won’t alter your opinions at all, but my husband who is nearly 70 has heart failure (left ventricular). This means it always a struggle for him to breathe. Yes, he could get a medical exemption from our doctora here in Spain. But, he refuses to be seen as an invalid, so wears his mask however hot it is... around 34º today. Anyway good luck and please keep yourselves and others safe. Cheers, Ruth.Edited: 12:55 pm, August 18, 2020 "
"Penalty is a €100 fine. Of course, it you have exemption because of a medical condition, as you suggested, then there obviously wouldnt be a fine. You'll be aware that mask wearing is generally required outside and in most indoor situations, except when actually eating or drinking, so plenty of times when the police might come across you not wearing one.  Leaving aside any medical issue, your aversion to wearing one for more than a couple of minutes surely makes a holiday in Tenerife all but impossible. There's the airport, the flights where you'd be required to wear one, let alone the general acceptance in Spain that you wear one. Maybe you'd find it best to go to a different country for your holiday."
"Ruth - as a resident, you may know the answer to this. Everything I read (in English) about the restrictions in Spain refer to ""masks"". In the UK, the restrictions refer to ""face coverings"", so masks, visors, scarves, bandanas, etc, can be worn. Just wondered if the Spanish regulations are similarly flexible or if it is actually masks that have to be worn.John"
Handz2018...I notice you were due to go to Greece also in July....how did you manage there ????
"Hi harters. They must be masks without valves. Visors alone are not acceptable, nor are scarves etc. A mask is defined as one that covers your nose and mouth with either loops behind the ears or two ties at the back of the head. Sorry that is a really geeky reply but it is how the rules are framed here on the Baleares. Cheers. I fear I am fighting a losing argument with people who think it is cool or big to fight against the laws in countries in which they are guests."
"Thanks, Ruth. I thought that was going to be the case but glad of the confirmation. And all we can do, as contributors here, is try to answer the queries asked. If folk don't like the answer, then that's a matter for them, not us. If folk say they intend to fight aganst the laws of a country they are visiting, then that's also a matter for them, not you. Let's hope they come back and post about their experiences in Spain."

"Is that last post directed at me? What the heck is going on with the Canarias forums? Maybe it is response to another post or just a rant, non of us know. Tripadvisor is designed for people looking for destination help and advice, rather than personal attacks on contributors. Please explain."
"I think it must be our friends turn today, the identical twin was here over the weekend. Both self-opinionated, obnoxious and by the comment about the Spanish, racist too. Don't think Tripadvisor are impressed with that sort of thing, so wouldn't be surprised if the post was removed as bullying and harassment."
