"Just seen on the Sun website that all bars/clubs have to close with immediate effect in Majorca, is this the case or will some bars remain open ? due to fly there on Sunday. It wont be worth going if everywhere is shut."

Still no updates from Travel republic or Jet2 in terms of cancellations.
"We are a family of 4 due to fly out in 3weeks time touch wood just B&B, getting no response from the hotel in Alcudia been trying to confirm room type etc since Feb. Sent Jet2 same emails also link about possibly hotel closures, tried putting in a booking today same flights same hotel same dates and it just says Plz contact customer service to complete your booking! Now seen the link about possible closures of places holding over 300 people which might include the hotel think the BV Club is the biggest on Majorca. Don't want to turn up at the airport again to be sent home."
How many regular bars and shops hold more than 300...
Looking at reply on different question on forum. The person who lives there has said bars are closing and not much food in supermarket. Have a read.
I’m in Palma right now. Things have changed dramatically during the course of the day. We looked into one of our favourite restaurants this morning with a view to lunching there later. By the time we got back it had closed “for the foreseeable future”. Many shops are in darkness and galleries and museums closed. Some bars and cafes of various sizes are closed too.
"OMG - thanks for telling us Best. So sad to hear it - such a contrast in one day. Is it ""taking defensive action""? Or is it over the top? What do local people think? Will visiting workers not be hired? Maybe they are trying to hit hard now before the peak summer season so it can be salvaged. Who knows. It's scary for everyone."
"Supermarket shelves were pretty empty (not just soap, toilet paper and pasta as in the U.K. but fresh vegetables, fruit and bread etc too). Talking to a member of staff in a hotel in central Palma, we were told that although the hotel is staying open, services and staff are being cut back. More news follows later."
"I am due to arrive on Tuesday and staying at Sunbeach apartments.I dont think easy jet are going to refund.Do we know if it is still worth going, will bars be open.Thank you"
Your best bet is not to go... nothing apart from supermarkets and chemists will be open..as for easy jet ..the have waivered the fee to change names and dates...so might be better to rebook for later in the year
Thanks for the advice
