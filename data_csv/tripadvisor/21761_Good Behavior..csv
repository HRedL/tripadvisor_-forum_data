"Thank you Risa for starting this post!I can’t provide a link but I can share a story: My mom is 87 years old and currently suffers from advanced dementia, Alzheimers type. She is otherwise physically healthy but no longer recognizes us. After a couple of years of being her sole caregiver once my dad passed away in 2014, followed by another few years of arranging care for her in her own home, I finally convinced my siblings that my mom really needed to be in a Long Term Care facility, and we moved her last September into a facility nearby.She had been there almost 6 months to the day when I was notified March 14th that family members would no longer be allowed in to visit their loved ones, for the residents’ own safety and protection. I was devastated, and wracked with guilt, but I knew that there was no way that my mom would be safe anywhere else due to her tendency to wander and the need for 24 hour supervision.Today is the first time in my life that I have not spent time with my mom on Mother’s Day, but I’m handling it better than I thought I would. Why? The staff on my mom’s locked unit have done an amazing job of looking after her, and the other residents, during this difficult and dangerous time! They have continued to show up for work, worked extra shifts to make up for those who stayed away, send us daily updates on the situation in the home, arrange to FaceTime with us so we can see our loved ones, and have let us know ahead of time that, today, every one of the mothers living there would be getting a flower to acknowledge her special day!It breaks my heart to not spend time with my mom today, but I will remain eternally grateful to those caregivers who will continue to be there when I cannot, and who make her smile her beautiful smile that I last saw during a virtual visit. So this post is a special shout-out and “Thank You” to all the caregivers in NYC nursing homes that are not getting the credit they deserve for the work they continue to do!"
"Thanks for this post, Risa. It will be great if this thread is kept politics-free."
"DeltaWing. That’s beautiful. I remember when my grandparents were in assisted living. After my grandfather died, my grandmother’s memory was not really there. When we visited, she would know that we were someone important to her (she would introduce me as her niece who was a doctor...). I would have felt awful if I couldn’t have visited her and seen her smile. So I understand your feelings of loss. Nice to be able to express that gratitude to healthcare workers."
"Thank you Risa. It must have been difficult for you knowing that your grandmother no longer remembered exactly who you were. I wasn’t sure your thread was the right place to post my experience, but I really wanted to acknowledge all the caregivers at nursing homes who continue to do their best under extremely difficult conditions, because the vast majority of them are doing just that!Edited: 5:33 pm, May 10, 2020 "

"Politics free? Lol. The best idea for a thread.Is the Bad Behavior one going to be deleted though, or kept going?"
"No reason. If that’s how people are letting their stress out, then that’s just fine. And that’s the end of that discussion. This is the happy place post. Go there for debate."
"Thanks for starting this thread, and thank you other posters for sharing heart felt moments. My parents have passed, so thankfully that's one less worry for my siblings and me. Lots of times we do express the idea that it's good they aren't around any longer to have to witness (and be appalled by) this, that, and the next thing. There is a bit of comfort in that."
"My brother made me a sew free mask when I told him I didn't have one, didn't know where to get one & didn't have the materials for one. Luckily, I had to have a non-invasive medical procedure last week & got a proper medical mask but, when I asked my brother if he wanted the mask back, he declined."
"Risa and Delta, I have been down the Alzheimer’s road with parents/relatives, and know how hard it can be. I read recently about a French nursing home where the owner and staff moved in with the residents for six weeks, in order to keep the residents safe. They did not want to unknowingly bring the virus in. There were pictures of them leaving for the first time recently. Good behavior."

"Amid the pandemic, a family learns their neighbors are their long-lost relativeshttps:/…The Njotens had met some neighbors in passing, but it wasn’t until California’s coronavirus stay-at-home order in March that the Njotens had a chance to really get to know the people who lived near them. During a “social distancing happy hour” outside on their street in early April, the Njotens struck up a conversation with Erik and Jen Strom, who live four houses away.Because Kjetil, 45, is originally from Norway and Erik, 38, has Norwegian ancestry, they started discussing Norwegian heritage. Jen, 37, said she had casually looked into her husband’s family history in the past but stopped when she was unable to locate Newton Island, where her husband’s Norwegian family was supposedly from.Kjetil and Zoe joked that it could be Njoten Island, the tiny speck of an island northwest of Bergen, Norway’s second-largest city. Kjetil grew up in Njoten, and it’s from there that his family derived its surname. The island, Kjetil said, is three miles long and one mile wide and has a population of about 30 people.That night, Kjetil emailed his mother in Norway, asking her to do some sleuthing. She looked at her own family records, and by the time Kjetil woke up the next morning, she had replied. Not only was Erik’s family from the same island, but the two men shared the same great-great-grandfather. In fact, the home that Kjetil grew up in once belonged to that great-great-grandfather, Jacob Njoten."
"Thank you for this post Risa, truly enjoying reading all these stories.I do IT for a company that has private nursing homes, so I have to go in them a few times a week. The work done by the personnel is so amazing, they barely ever get a day off. The love that the personnel has for the residents is undeniable and they have such patience.Last week I went to a residence where one senior was waiting for his test. It wasn't clear if he was sick or not (the test came back negative) but until he got the results he could not leave his room, a rule he clearly did not agree with. The head nurse's patience with this man who kept getting out and trying to get to the currently closed dining room was just amazing.I will definitely love reading all the stories posted here."

"Thank you for continuing to post Good Behaviour stories. jcmtl1965: Your experience comforted me in particular; it reminded me of what I myself witnessed regularly at my mom’s long term care home pre-COVID. Many of our seniors are so helpless and vulnerable at this time and those caregivers truly are heros.Noraatc: Those poor pets who don’t understand what is going on in the world, just that they miss their caregivers/owners. I wonder how easily they will adapt to their new homes; it will require very special individuals to take them in. Yes, lots of good behaviour going on!"
