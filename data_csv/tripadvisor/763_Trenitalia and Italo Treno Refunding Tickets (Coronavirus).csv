"Italian media is reporting that both Trenitalia and Italo Treno will refund tickets which would otherwise be non-refundable due to the Coronavirus situation. But there are limitations:TRENITALIATicket must have been purchased up to and including February 23 for travel through and including March 1. The refund will take the form of a TRAVEL VOUCHER for future travel within ONE YEAR, for all tickets concerning the high-speed reserved trains (including Intercity and Intercity Night trains). The refund will be in CASH for the unreserved regionale tickets. This applies to all Trenitalia trains nationwide, without geographic limitation. The request for refund must be submitted prior to March 1.ITALO TRENOTicket must have been purchased on or before February 23, for travel through and including March 1. The refund will take the form of a TRAVEL VOUCHER for future travel within July 31, 2020, for all tickets involving travel which originates or terminates in NORTHERN ITALIAN train stations (from Bologna north). The request for refund must be submitted prior to the scheduled departure date of the ticket.The limitations for refunds may be loosened depending on the evolution of the Coronavirus situation, so it is worthwhile keeping a close eye on this topic.DETAILED INFORMATION:https://www.trenitalia.com/it/informazioni/r…https:/…misure-iniziative-coronavirus"
"Grazie GAC!I have just one prepurchased Italo ticket, but its not until mid April. We are waiting a couple more weeks before making a decksion, but if I do reschedule, it certainly wont be for this summer!Will keep watching....."
can someone provide a refund form link for .Italo
Too late: refund requests for non-refundable tickets needed to be submitted no later than March 1.REFUNDABLE tickets continue to be subject to their specific contract terms.
This is absolute crap. Italo will never have my business again. Our travel plans for next week we’re just derailed yesterday as the virus continues to worsen and they aren’t allowing refunds? Nope I will stick to other train companies for all rebooking.
"Kaitlyn, please maybe use other words but the 4th one you wrote.The virus continues to worsen but Italo and other companies are still operating, also to let people make necessary trips. If you cancelled your trip you may have your reasons, but it's a choice. They would work for you if you were there. When you booked a train ticket, you knew that it was an agreement with something of risk from you. I understand people who cancel, but a bit calmer and more human attitude would be important in this moment which is not easy WORLDWIDE."
See updated information for Trenitalia:https:/…105910451
"I didn’t even want to cancel the ticket, I simply wanted to move it to a later date. I understand that this is worldwide but at the same time the companies should understand that travel is restricted at this time to even make it into the country from the US. With tourism being a huge part of the Italian economy, rebooking our vacations to still support that economy should be supported, not turned away and said oh well your loss."
How is travel to Italy from the U.S. being restricted other than some airlines not flying into Milan?I've not heard of any restrictions - can you say what and where those are?
"I understand, anyway trains in Italy have their policy and are not supposed to make move mostly US citizens (who are not so big part anyway). When booking you accepted some risk. Anyway, I agree with you that moving the trip to another date, if not cancelling and asking for refunds, should have been a bit easier."
# 7Are you saying that Italo Treno won't allow you to change the travel date of your train ticket?I would carefully review the contract terms of your ticket:https://www.italotreno.it/en/the-train/fares
Does Italo have a support email to reach out to? Couldn't find one on their website.
"Same, italo email is elusivehttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18776…"
My reason for cancelling my travel plans is that I have NO CHOICE. In the current coronavirus situation I would be acting against the Italian Law if I did not.I am simply NOT ALLOWED to travel and would have to pay a heavy fine if I did.
I agree 100%
"Apparently not true if you live in the USA. They told me Trenitalia has no established policy for quote ""North America"" unquote. If you live in the USA and had planned to go to Italy in Feb-Apr time frame, you are out of luck! You will get no refund. Even the Trenitalia refund form doesn't even list the USA as a country!!!!"
"Ann, I completely agree, regardless of what Italo and Trenitalia may want to believe, they are not able to provide our family with the prepaid services we'd booked for next week -- they would be in violation of the law if we were to board/ride. If anyone has success locating a viable Italo Treno email, please post, the one I found from an older Tripadvisor thread has auto bounced back a ""no longer valid"" email response. Thank you."
"Steve D:>>Even the Trenitalia refund form doesn't even list the USA as a country!!!!<<Incorrect - fake news. The form can be converted to English but the auto fill options within that form remain in Italian. Therefore, United States = STATI UNITI D'AMERICA"
"It would be helpful if someone who has actually succeeded in getting a refund from either Trenitalia or Italo Treno makes a report on this website!! And that person should also specify the method of communication (telephone, online chat, fax, e-mail, face-to-face at the train station in Italy, etc.), and whether holding a refundable or a wholly non-refundable ticket."
"Has Italo extended their earlier offer of refunds for travel to or from the red zone up between February 23 and March 1 to reflect the current travel ban?All I see on the website is a form to be used to justify ""necessary"" travel:https://italoinviaggio.italotreno.it/…Nothing for tourists who have canceled their March Italy trip."
"# 19On my computer, Italo's hyperlinks to ""support"" and to the Italian-language website have been disabled (by Italo, I presume).I do not find ANY useful information on their English-language website concerning REFUNDS due to Coronavirus, I assume that Italo will continue respect the contract terms of their partially REFUNDABLE tickets.I have no idea whether there is any pertinent information on their Italian-language website.I have the strong sense that Italo (as well as Trenitalia) are in CASH PRESERVATION MODE."

"#22""The offer will be rescheduled"" is a literal translation from Italian, but means that the number of trains in circulation will be reduced."
"This is stupid, the prohibition to move around in Italy comes from the government it is definitely NOT a choice of mine and I should be able to get either a refund or at least a miserable voucher."
"Correct that is what I am saying. They will not allow change of date with the type of ticket I purchased, Atleast that is what the online prompt is telling me. I am unable to actually reach a person to speak with."
"# 26If you purchased an Italo Treno ""LOW COST"" ticket, perhaps you may not have submitted your change request within the deadline:""This ticket can be modified: the date/time of the trip by paying a surcharge equal to 50% of the ticket price up to 3 days before departure, as well as any difference in price with regard to fares available at the time of the change.

"I am trying to submit the Italo form for our travel date of 17 March, Naples to Venice, and everything goes smoothly until I press the ""I'n not a robot"" button. It churns and then reverts to a blank square. And I cannot continue. Any ideas?"
Thanks for the email id for cancellation of train tickets. I canceled my US to Italy trip scheduled for 1st week of May hence cancelling Italy train tickets.I had bought Italo train tickets in February 2nd week. One from Venice to Roma termini and the other R/T from Rome to Florence.Hopefully they will refund. Keeping fingers crossed.

"Thanks for the info.I filed the refund last night but my question is this. Do I need to cancel the ticket as well?Just to see, I went through part way of canceling and asked me where it should put in the refund -- my ticket is ""economy"" so it can get 60% refund anyway. I didn't ultimately cancel but wanted to see the sequence,So, I'm unsure of the exact of procedure -- i.e., canceling, apply for refund, etc.Thank you!"
"All the Italo trains we purchased tickets last Oct/Nov for March travels have been canceled (1 set are refundable/eligible for 60% refund). I am requesting a credit back on my credit card, vouchers or sub-payment to be used 1 year from when we booked are useless to us. I am more impressed with how the Vatican has auto refunded their March ticket holders for canceled service, they are a role model.Edited: 12:05 pm, March 15, 2020 "
I'm in the same boat. I can get my Italo tickets refunded to my card at 50/60% via RailEurope or Vouchers directly from them. I'm not particularly happy with either as I'm not certain that I'll be traveling back to Italy within the next year. Not sure if I need to just wait it out for refunds to hopefully get to 100% or just bite the bullet and accept the lower amount. Not sure how much luck the credit card companies will have with charge backs on these since they were purchased back in November for May travel.
"Hello All,I am in the same boat as many of you. I requested ITALO refunds following the instructions provided by the company for travel on March 27th. I only received confirmation that said my request had been submitted; however, no confirmation whether the refund or credit has been processed. Has anyone been successful in actually getting their money back or a full credit for future travel?"
"duue17:You need to have some patience. Processing all of these requests is going to take some time and I would doubt that all of Italo's office / administration employees are in the office at work - I would bet a good number are staying at home. As a reference point, Trenitalia initially gave an estimate of 30 days to process the request and now they are saying that they are soooo overwhelmed, that it will take considerably more time to work through all the requests.Edited: 5:57 pm, April 08, 2020 "
"How do you go about requesting a refund (not voucher) from Italo? All I see on their site is that they will issue a voucher. That won't work for me as I will be unable to use that in that time frame, or any time frame for that matter. Following the refund process through the Italo site I see that if you have a voucher you can then request it to be converted to cash (or credit to credit card I assume). Is that the way to go or am I missing something? This is not a very clear process. I much preferred what the Vatican did as others have noted. Thanks!"
>>I much preferred what the Vatican did as others have noted.<<I guess next time you need to book your train tickets through the Vatican website.
Thanks for the useful reply Drew.
"Just went through the process and got through the security bit, etc, only to brought to a page that says (in Italian)The selected record was modified by another user after recovery. Continue. (SBL-DAT-00523)Which is some sort of Siebel (?) error. I didn't get any email from them yet, but I guess I wait and see and try again later if nothing happens. The one issue I had with the form was the train number: I just put in the 4 digit number after FRECCIAROSSA 100 on my ticket."
"I see no place on the italotreno.it website to apply for a refund. I am holding tickets for May. I go to SUPPORT and it gives me a FAQ menu. I click on RQUEST A REFUND and it tells me ""no results available for this query"". I also see no email address under CONTACT US. Any advice?Edited: 12:39 pm, April 15, 2020 "
"Tom M:>>I click on RQUEST A REFUND and it tells me ""no results available for this query""<<???? - it works fine for me. Are you sure that your browser software is up to date? Sounds like your browser is outdated. There is another path to the claim form:Go to the homepage. In the middle of the webpage, there is a set of information links - the first one is labeled - ""Information regarding COVID-19"". Click on that link and you will see the details of their cancellation policy with a link to the claim form.Edited: 1:48 pm, April 15, 2020 "
After many attempts I found that to get a refund from italotreno you must file a claim on their website. The claim form has room for only one ticket code number. I am holding three separate tickets (6 technically) with three seperate ticket code numbers. When filing the second claim form it told me that it could not be done because there is already a claim in the system with my information. Any advice?
Tom M:Did you follow the directions and select the proper reason for cancellation? It needs to be Health Emergency 2020.
I did not....I just put ticket purchase refund. thanks. I'll see if I can amend the form. Something tells me that I will have to wait until my claim is rejected to do so....but thank you!
thank you! I looked all over the Italo Rail site & could not find how to get a refund for my upcoming tripl
"This is Italo's information page on refunds due to COVID-19 cancellations: https://italoinviaggio.italotreno.it/…One question though. In their FAQ page, I noticed that it's possible to convert their usual vouchers (Borsellino Credito or Italo Credito) to cash: https:/…faq. Check the ""Credito and Borsellino Italo"" section. Does anyone know if the refund vouchers for COVID-19 would also be eligible for such conversion to cash? And if it's possible, is it possible to get a refund to a foreign bank account?Edited: 10:44 pm, April 21, 2020 "
"Trenitalia's refund page now states ""The exceptional situation caused by the COVID 19 health emergency led to the submission of a huge volume of reimbursement requests, for which the response times could exceed 90 days, going beyond the ordinary 30 expected days."""
Curious... Has anyone who submitted a refund request to Trenitalia actually received it?
"David R:Yes, several people have already reported that they received their refund. However, due to the overwhelming number of requests, it could take some time to process all of them. So you need to have some patience."
"Hi everyone! I know in the past, when italo would cancel a train, we would be able to get a full (monetary) refund. Is that not an option at all seeing as to how most most trains are actually canceled anyway? Anyone been successful getting money back? I’ve already requested a couple of vouchers but I still have a few others that I am trying to see what to do with."
Did you manage to get refund? I have my travel plans on May 21 and wondering how can I cancel the ticket.
Bishweshwar P>>wondering how can I cancel the ticket.<<The answer will depend on which train company you used and if you made the ticket purchase directly with them. Both Trenitalia and Italo have links to their refund process off of their English language homepage.
"Italo refund status as of May 6, 2020:Status Open I am assuming it's pending refund review."
"I had economy tickets with Italo. We were supposed to be in Italy now, May 13-26. Yay. But we are not, boo. Everyone of our reservations for hotels, airline, and tours refunded us back to original form of payment (one or two made policy exceptions because of covid). Italo would not make an exception and offered a refund minus a 40% penalty, which is according to Policy. On May 5th I cancelled all 5 separate train trips. Within a week I received the refund back to my CC for 2 of the trips. I am still waiting on the other 3. I am not sure why 2 came back quickly and the other 3 are no where to be found...LOL. The funny thing is I received a confirmation email for two trips only, and did not receive emails for the other 3 trips. The refunds I received were from the trips I did not receive the confirmation email for. I called Italo and the confirmed all trips were cancelled properly and it can take up to 30 days to refund. I am waiting for the other 3 trip refunds. Good Luck with your refunds!"
"TheOtherFloridaGuy:With Economy tickets, the other option would have been to receive a voucher for 100% of the value of the tickets. I can understand that some people may prefer the cash back, however, and take the refund via their normal policy of 80% for Flex tickets or 60% for Economy tickets."
"Hi, I read most of the messages and understand that many here were able to get refund from Trenitalia, but I'm not sure if you have been sucessful on receiving refunds from Italo.I received an e-mail from Italo on May 21th with a voucher code for 100% of the value of tickets purchased. But I can't convert it into cash. When I try to do it in their website (Support > Compensation Search page), I get an error message: ""Unfortunately we have encountered an error and cannot complete your transaction. Please try again later. If the error persists, we suggest you make your booking via one of the alternative channels: our contact center Pronto Italo on 06 07 08, Ticket Office at the station, Italo Travel Agencies.""Was anyone here able to convert Italo voucher into cash? Is this the correct way to do so? I tried to phone Italo, but I won't get answered.Thanks in advance!"
"fernandospj:If you wanted a cash refund, you should have used the regular refund policy, not the COVID-19 refund policy. Italo will refund 80% of the value of Flex tickets or 60% of Economy tickets."
"That's sad. Unfortunately, I only got here today and now I see that they treat these vouchers and the refund process as different procedures. That's clear in their Coronavirus notices.Before asking the voucher, I had read their FAQ and now I see that the following answer was kind of misleading:""How can I ask for a credit to be converted to cash?If you have a credit over €4 you can request a cash equivalent directly from italo.it. If you have a Borsellino Italo you can make your request simply by logging into your Italo account and clicking on My Page. To redeem a compensation voucher or an Italo credit, go to the Self Service area, which you will find by clicking on Support and scrolling down.""I assumed that this compensation voucher above could be converted into cash, but I was wrong.I hope that I will be able to travel there before voucher expires.Thanks for your help!"
