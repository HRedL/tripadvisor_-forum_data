I have flights booked to Cebu for the end of February 2020. I just saw the news about the dengue epidemic there. It's a little concerning as we will be traveling with children. I haven't booked hotels yet and not sure if I should reconsider our travel plans? We mostly plan to stay in resorts but want to do some day trips to the islands. Are there people familiar with the situation in Cebu resorts can chime in about the dengue risk there?
"Apparently some people have died from Dengue fever but I don't know any one who has contracted it during the ""epidemic"" Foreigner or Filipino. Nobody is taking any obvious precautions either. Life is all business as usual. So except for the fact that I have seen it posted on some foreigner forums, I wouldn't know there is an epidemic."
there are lots of posts in the posts in the last few days so work your way back.2020 is next year.
"The key message from these posts is don't panic: it is largely affecting residents of less affluent areas where stagnant water lies around, and where no anti-mosquito measures such as spraying oneself with an insecticide such as the Australian Rid does not occur.Two weeks ago I was in Iloilo City but like others, saw no signs of life other than normal.There's no reason to reschedule trips. Without downplaying it, dengue has affected a very small percentage of the Filipino population."
