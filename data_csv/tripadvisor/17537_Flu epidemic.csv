"It was on the news yesterday that there's a flu epidemic currently at France and that it will reach its peak next week. We're due to arrive on Tuesday, am I worrying too much?"
"Unless you have some underlying health condition that means catching the flu would be especially dangerous for you, then I would say yes."
"The flu is not only in France, so you could easily catch it staying home too ;-)It's the time of the year for the flu, so there's not much you can do about it. Just hope you won't catch it ;-)"
I guess I AM worrying too much! :D
"flu is everywhere, so i wouldnt even think about it.if youre so worried just take a flu vaccine, it will milden the symptoms."
"Thank you all, I know I'm being paranoid, there's a flu outbreak over here too, but I try not to go to crowded places that's why I was a little worried about DLP. Everything will be alright. :)"
"Thank you for your advice, Bean_Limerick! :)"
"Seems to be all over Europe. But it's a rather nasty prolonged coughing virus rather than one of those deadly flus where you are really ill and know it...in that you can't raise your head off the pillow. Flying , travelling and general proximity to crowds is likely to afect you.Ed"
