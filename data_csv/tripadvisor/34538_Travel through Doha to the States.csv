Hi everyone. I am UK citizen with a valid ESTA who has spent 16 days in Croatia. I flew to Istanbul yesterday where I was meant to get on a flight to Chicago. When I got to the departing Turkish Airways gate they said they had received an email from the US government who wouldn't let me fly unless I go to the embassy to get my passport etc verified for flying. There was 6 of us who weren't allowed on this flight and apprently they get this email for passengers on every flight. I'm now looking at flying with Qatar via Doha. I was wondering if anyone has had an experience with Qatar airways and getting stopped for no good reason. I'm hoping it's just a Turkish Airways thing. Thanks Laura
"There is a travel ban to the US from Europe in place as you now know. Non essential travel is not permitted. Did Turkish Airline allow you to rebook your flight? What is the purpose of your travel to the US? You mention you have an ESTA, if you were going on vacation, that's not happening this year."
I was under the impression all ESTAs had been rescinded/suspended. You would need to be an US national or have exceptional circumstances to be allowed entry in the US at the moment.
have you checked if your ESTA is still valid? I thought they had cancelled a lot of them
"You hold a UK passport and have been in Croatia for 16 days.These are the travel restrictions to the US:https:/…from-other-countries.htmlhttps:/…entry-requirementsCroatia is not part of the Schengen area to you could technically travel to the US.""email from the US government who wouldn't let me fly unless I go to the embassy to get my passport etc verified for flying."" I do not know the details of the procedures. I would expect they want prove that you have been for 14 or more days in Croatia, before they let you fly.""I'm now looking at flying with Qatar via Doha."" As you are still travelling to the same country with the same Immigration Authorities, why would you expect a different outcome as when you tried to fly from Istanbul.Advice: Do as you were told and visit the nearest US Embassy."
"I do not know if the ESTA has been cancelled. I would not assume, but it is always good to double check:https://lu.usembassy.gov/esta-cancellation-information-in-response-to-covid-19/#:~:text=Any%20traveler%20with%20a%20valid,canceled%20due%20to%20this%20Proclamation.Edited: 4:19 am, August 02, 2020 "
