"https://www.ktnv.com/news/coronavirus/gov-si…""We’re calling it Nevada United Road Map to Recovery. We’re going to ease some of the restrictions that we had previously as it relates to retail curbside pickup. Some of our outdoor activities we’re going to loosen up what some of the restrictions are. Unfortunately we’re going to have to extend the stay at home order a little bit. We just have not reached exactly where we want to get in the downward trajectory. Our statistics have plateaued. We’ve got almost 5,000 cases now in the state of Nevada and 225 fatalities so those numbers have kind of stabilized and hospitalizations and intensive care hospitalizations have begun to decline. And so we are looking forward to continue to bring our economy back to life a little bit."""
"The goalposts always seem to be moving. At first, it was flatten the curve so we don't break the healthcare system. Now, it's lowering the number of new cases each day, despite ramping up testing, which will inevitably increase the number of diagnosed cases."
Well it looks i might as well change my trip to summer2021.
From across the pond it seems that those with the power are taking a cautious approach to ending the lockdowns - whether that's right or wrong is a matter for a different debate.I am no expert on the USA legal system but is a risk of some future legal proceedings because of deaths after the Gov makes a decision a factor in all of this.Just asking out of curiosity.

TomC97: problem is most of our elected “leaders” are career politicians. They achieved some level of success by NOT making decisions and the various other behaviours of career politicians. In order to do this for this crisis most of them have completely ceded authority to appointed “health experts”. On and on....In Canada we have have a few provinces which almost no Covid hospitalizations remaining and very few deaths. A couple of them are moving forward in face of considerable opposition. Hopefully their success in reopening will pave the way for the rest of us.
"“ He hasn't done it so far from what I've seen. When he mentions flattening the curve, I haven't seen him produce a diagram showing that, and what the specific decision points will be.”@Rallen, I have been watching them all. He really is presenting charts and graphs when talking to the State. He does not necessarily link them to anything specific to the future though. I do not care for him at all but I will give him that much."

"“ The casinos might open but then when a guest or two gets and spreads the virus, the casino will close right back up.”Gosh, you could say that about everything I suppose. I wonder if non essential businesses around the US will simply close when a case is identified on premise. Do you think it will go like that?"
"I think so eventually. That’s what happened with the Spanish Flu Pandemic. It hung around for two years because businesses stayed open and the virus just plundered along killing.Edited: 6:58 pm, April 29, 2020 "
If anyone is still holding out hope Vegas will be open before the 4th of July... I am sorry.
Sisolak sure does love the control here it seems.

"I (did) travel to Vegas several times a year, and am hoping to go a couple of times this summer. Boy, your governor is an idiot. He will for sure copy the plan California has, since it doesn't seem like he has a brain cell of his own. What the hell is he waiting for?"
"@ChicagoThe wife of the Illinois governor isn't in Illinois anymore. She is hiding out at their estate in Florida. Took their private jet. The Mayor of Chicago is, I assume still getting her hair cut. I still don't see any politician wear a mask when speaking.Great examples of good enough for thee, not for me. Meanwhile the Governor of South Dakota, who never shut down the state mind you, is allowing businesses to choose how and when they open. A vacation to Deadwood looks more and more likely."
"Ever been to Deadwood PnS? It’s a six hour drive for us roughly, but it’s definitely unique and different. You’d be a big fish in a small pond gambling wise."
"No KC, I haven't. However, I want to keep my options open. I don't care about being the big fish at this point, though that sounds cool, I just want to have fun with some decent human beings in near proximity. I'm still crossing my fingers for Vegas, even if it means a fall or winter trip, but I want a backup plan. Really want to gamble and enjoy a pool. I will say, the old west vibe is cool, and if my wife is by my side anyplace can be fun."
"I’m not sure about pools in Deadwood. We stayed at the Holiday Inn express, and I can’t remember if it had an indoor pool. Of course they have the old classic hotels like Bullock and Franklin. The Bullock is supposedly haunted. We went on a haunted tour there."
"It won't be a fun pool but beggars can't be choosers. I would not stay anywhere where they claim it is haunted. Another option would be Morongo. It's close, one of the bartenders at Cielo is our buddy and always takes care of us. The casita villas have their own pool and a indoor/outdoor shower. We are also their middle out of three tiers there so there is that. Just going stir crazy here."
"I get it, we were supposed go to Vegas in month, and had another weekend getaway prior to that. Now who knows what’ll happen."
Vegas runs on no rules...implementing many of rules will make Vegas into a place that nobody knows or will enjoy in the short to medium term

"Just from Wisconsin, it't amazing how many areas with no new cases, yet the statewide orders are still in place. Where I live there were 3 total cases and no new cases for 14 days, yet we're still in shelter in place."
"I think he's making the correct adjustment at this time. He is increasing the level of people movement by allowing non-essential retail to open up, albeit with the curbside delivery restriction.After two weeks of this activity, he will have the data on new COVID-19 cases. He can then assess if further activity can be opened up if there is no increase in cases, or a decrease in the number of cases may still continue. Worst case is if there is a significant rise in COVID-19 cases from this adjustment, then it is a lesser task to close back down than if there was a more widespread opening of businesses."

The ski resort town hotel I stay at is apparently haunted but I’ve never heard anything. I had to google that Bally’s thing. Wow.
I had a night in Deadwood on a 2018 summer road trip. Kitschy little place. Worth a night. It was also about 10 days before the bike rally in Sturgis. So it was neat to drive through there and see the preparations. Big encampments set up outside of town with fields and a few cabins for rent...and bars with big “ Sponsored by Budweiser “ signs being set up.
"Aren't all South Dakota casinos shut down right now? even Deadwood..?Montana casinos ( there are no table games anywhere) are slated to be the first nationwide to reopen..week of May 4th ( yes, subject to change). Lots of good scenery in Montana, outdoorsy stuff..postcard -type views in areas...and cows ( twice as many cows as human residents)...Edited: 2:32 pm, April 30, 2020 "
They are still gambling on the machines in gas stations here in Wisconsin.
"I've happily stayed at Luxor which many said is haunted. But the sheer number of horrific deaths at Bally's is a different story. Look up the Congress Plaza Hotel in Chicago. That is basically the Queen Mary if it was a building and not a boat. The casinos in South Dakota are closed, however I suspect they will open up relatively soon.Good to know about Montana."
Also check out the Alexandria in Downtown LA. My friend lived there. Someone died in his bathroom before he moved in. He showed me the basement and the elevator where a little girl was pushed down the shaft. Apparently the doors used to always open when he walked past on the 5th floor.
Deadwood's casinos are still properly closed.
"This morning (Thu, Apr 30), at 11:30 a.m. local time, I went to the Governor's official website and there is NO Emergency Order posted extending the close-down orders beyond today.

We need another interview with they Mayor. I feel we could all use that content right now.
"Absolutely Haymaker, I would enjoy that. The GN looks really awesome. Pool has a lazy river, there is another casino next door too for variety. Anything right now is a possibility.

"Compare today's situation with the Hong Kong flu of 68-69, US population 200 million (320 million today) 100,000 deaths, mostly elderly, like today., Covid expected in 65,000 range, nothing closed down in 1969 and it was considered a ""mild pandemic""."
ranger. I am confused. Did they have shelter in place during Hong Flu of 68-69? And what number of deaths would be required to have shelter in place? Just curious.
"“ Covid expected in 65,000 range”That’s about where things are now.So, no more deaths?Yay!"
"“population 200 million (320 million today) 100,000 deaths” That would equate to 160,000 deaths by percentage with our current US population. Assuming no quarantine this time Covid deaths would be much higher than the current 65,000. They might be near/above the 160,000 in the Hong Kong Flu model. Interesting."
"I lived through the Hong Kong Flu as a kid. 4th grade. Lots of teachers and classmates got sick but no one died. Same for my family. My school (a small Catholic one) closed for a week but we just had to make it up during what would have been Easter break.I remember seeing a Hong Kong Flu coloring book (yes, really!).

No. The COVID & pneumonia deaths are included in the cumulative COVID deaths.So you find a report from the CDC to be useless?

">>>The 66,000+ now all died from covid related issues and all tested positive. <<<That isn't true actually.

"""I'm not claiming anything. I'm sharing direct quotes from the CDC, along with sources""No you're not, you're misunderstanding the data. I guess I'm going to have to put it like this: Every news source and every expert place the number at 60,000+.
