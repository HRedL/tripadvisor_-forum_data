I might be travelling to Ukraine next week ( Dniperpetrovsk) and I'm a little worried about the current flu outbreak. My friend told me that it's actually worse then the media reports as not to scare people. Also I have learned that Crime in Dniperpetrovsk is the worst since the early 90's. Apparently the criminals aren't scared of the Police and even do brazen acts in daylight. Crime levels have jumped dramatically the past few months apparently. Any insight would be grateful!!
"Hi! I dont live in Dnepropetrovsk (I live in Cherkasy, central Ukraine), so cant provide real ""insight"", but here is my opinion: it is winter, so flu is definitely present, didn`t hear about terrible outbreak, but if Your trip is necessary, You should take standard precautions such as: avoid crowded places, take taxi instead of crowded bus, wash hands, keep yourself warm, eat healthy food to support your immune system, maybe even put medicine mask on your face... Am I too obvious? You can buy an ointment called ""оксалиновая мазь"" in any pharmacy. Grease it inside your nose, and it will help prevent the virus getting inside. It is a popular precaution mean. Unfortunately flu/cold is always a lottery when you travel. Hope You will be safe, good luck!"
Is it common to wear a medicine mask on the face in Ukraine ?I know that in Asia it is common but it's not really common to wear a medecin mask in Western Europe in Public Transport even with flu outbreaks unless you are an Asian tourist. Sometime a police officer asks you your papers and want to see your face...
It seems there are some people wearing medecins masks in big UA citieseuronews.com/2016/…Edited: 4 years ago 
"Wearing medicine mask in UA is not common but its totally understandable, and nobody will pay much attantion to this..."
Maybe I'm just a little paranoid but schools apparently in Dnipropetrovsk are closed for another week. It must be serious. I'm now having second thoughts about going?
How about getting a flu shot in Canada ?It seems that it's the same recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2015-2016 northern hemisphere influenza season.who.int/influenza/…
"Hello! I'm in Dnipropetrovsk now. First of all, schools haven't been closed yet. They were closed for a day due to severe frost but still not because of the flu. Second, being a MD myself I would not recommend to do any anti-flu shots as long as the official diagnosis here is ""acute viral infection"". How can we know whether it is flu or not, unless the tests on chicken embryos are performed? Every year the situation is pretty same - much ado about nothing. Flu as flu, as everywhere. As for the masks. Well, in some stores employees are wearing them. Ukrainian Minister of Health tried to prove us it is useless. I'd rather apply some oxoline ointment, as it was mentioned before, than stress the immune system with vaccinations. As for the crime level, yes it is high. Also beware of the taxi drivers who try to overcharge foreigners (recent experience: wanted 50 euro instead of 7 to get downtown from the airport). If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

">>As for the masks. Well, in some stores employees are wearing them. Studies Show Masks Do Helpwww.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/maskGood read ""How Flu Spreads""most experts think that flu viruses are spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Less often, a person might also get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose.www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/spread.htm"
"Thanks, cap! It's my job to know about human diseases as I have already written. But the question was whether people in Ukraine wear masks or not. So the answer is: some people wear them but most don't. The mask should be changed every 2 hours and this is the proper way. When the person takes it off to talk an then puts it on, the efficiency reduces dramatically. Everybody's free in his/her choice what to wear."
"the flu epidemic has been going down now. Next week it will be relatively ok. Take usual precautions - avoid crowded places, wash hands, wash your nose at home, apply ointment in your nose, eat healthy food and excercise in fresh air.It's not that bad. otherwise if you are afraid of flu you can postpone your trip until spring (actually the weather will be better in spring and you will enjoy your trip more).PS In Kiev I do not see many people wearing medical masks. It kind of looks strange.Edited: 4 years ago "
