"Hello,I am very anxious because I would like to change my booking for 2 weeks now but I haven’t gotten any reply from Travelgenio. I have opened 3 tickets and emailed them multiple times. I can not travel in these trying times because I am showing symptoms And currently doing social distancing. Please help me out how to get in contact with them as the fees increase each day they do not reply back to me. Thankyou"
There's no magic solution. They probably have thousands of customers in your situation and little manpower to deal with them. Travel insurance is probably your best bet.
What fee increases each day?
If you look at any of the recent posts on any of the many travelgenio threads you will find the bot provides an email address that you can contact and get a response in a few days (allegedly)
Hello Abdul. Thank you for your comment. You will receive a response to your mailbox in the next days hours. Thank you for your cooperation.INFORMATION REGARDING COVID-19 (CORONAVIRUS)…travelgenio.com/pages-information-regarding…
"Hello Travelgenio team,I am also very anxious about the lack of communication from your end. My flight is departing on Thursday night and I have not managed to get hold of anyone. Can I please get a response as the flights now got cancelled? I've also sent an other email this morning. I would appreciate an answer today on the next steps to follow as it is now very urgent. Thank you"
"Hi Linda, you will receive a reply asap. Regardss"
"TG customer: hello, hello, anybody there?TG: - - - - - - TG customer posts a complaint on TA. TG rep on TA: hello, can I help you?!"
I still haven’t received any response from you guys.
"Abdul Jalil,If ""you guys"" refers to Travelgenio that would be no surprise even during normal times. On this thread you have been dealing with a Travelgenio bot, not a human being, although I doubt that ""caring"" is part of the real job description of any human working for Travelgenio."
"You've had replies from ""you guys"". ""You guys"" are simply Tripadvisor posters.What you haven't had is a reply from Travelgenio. We can't help you and they won't."
"Abdul Jalil Due to the number of requests received by mail and call center, our response times have increased. Our agents try to prioritize based on flight schedules, but receiving duplicate emails will not help us speed up the process. Please contact us via the contact section of our site if you have not done so, write your booking code and flight date in the subject line, and our agents will contact you as soon as possible. over the next few days. cordially"
"Wow, that Travelgenio response looks like something from a human being. In any case, yesterday I got an e-mail from Air Asia stating that refunds are taking 12 to 16 weeks directly from the airline to customers. I would expect it to be even slower when you have to go through a third party like Travelgenio."
It hasn’t been “bot like answers” in a couple weeks. I even sensed emotion recently.None of the other OTAs are even showing up here. I give TG respect for replying. Also shows concern for reputation which is telling.
