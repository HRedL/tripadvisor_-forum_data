"Dear fellow travelers: I've been using this garage for 30 years, but last night my friend's car was broken into...for a blanket...on the 7th floor, yellow paint. Turns out that ""monitoring"" is done, which means cameras but in no way means ""protection."" The garage has monitoring on the first six levels, but does not post this; therefore, I am. Staff at the garage were so helpful-vacuumed up the glass and put plastic on the windows-but please know that parking here is completely at your own risk. We had double checked door locks, nothing on view as suggested, except, the blanket. Apparently homelessness extends to car break ins. So, keep everything either with you or stowed in such a way as it cannot be seen AND show your glove compartment as empty, if you park overnight. If possible park on the six lower floors, closer to the elevator. And, because it might be helpful to know: two nights in SF meant $69 for parking. The garage had the nerve to charge for the time their staff was cleaning the car (1 hour), and I balked. My bill was reconfigured and back to $69-but seriously, with social media being an outlet, they should not have even broached the idea. Hoping this helps someone have a happier holiday."
Sorry this happened. We use that garage all the time as well. But this could have happened anywhere in the city on the streets and other 24 hours garages open to the public. They have foot patrol in the garage but again that does not deter. All of these are crimes of opportunity. It takes less than a minute. Do keep everything out of sight and leave nothing you can not go without or of value in the trunk (passport or electronics)if others are reading.Edited: 2 years ago 
Why isn't there a way that only car owners are allowed to enter the garage?
"There is, but not at a self-park garage.Half a block down Sutter Street, towards Powell, there is a garage which uses valet parking. This is the one we use. Nobody but attendants gets beyond the cashier."
"** ""Why isn't there a way that only car owners are allowed to enter the garage?"" **All parking structures have multiple pedestrian doors, for convenience and also for emergency exiting in case of a fire, earthquake, etc. A huge place, like the Sutter-Stockton, Pier 39, or Yerba Buena which is a full square block, might have eight or more street-level doors. It wouldn't be feasible for the garage management to have an attendant at each door. So it's up to each driver to worry about his or her own vehicle or personal safety. If you can, as the OP said, park on a lower level and in an area with more activity, like near the attendant's booth, elevator, etc. If you can find a space along a wall, back in and hug the wall, not leaving space behind your car for a burglar to tamper with the trunk (before going to the garage, you've already put your stuff in the trunk, so potential thieves don't see you stashing it once you've parked). Even with any precautions you take, there is no 100% guarantee of safety, so never leave anything in the car that you don't want stolen.Welcome to life in the big city. Not every big city - but this big city has a huge problem with car burglaries targeted at visitors that even the loudest naysayers can't deny.Welcome to life in the big city."
"I think ""except the blanket"" may be the moral of the story. Leave nothing in sight."
">>Turns out that ""monitoring"" is done, which means cameras but in no way means ""protection."" << >>parking here is completely at your own risk<<Yes, these are the same conditions I assume apply in any public parking facility. In fact, the ""at your own risk"" part is probably printed on the parking tag you're given as you enter.And attendants can be useless... we watched a group of young men breaking into a car at a public garage near Civic Center. As we left, we reported this to the attendant/cashier. He shrugged and went about the transaction. I'm sorry this happened to your friend, but I think one of the more important parts of the post is ""I've been using this garage for 30 years"". I think this makes the point that overall, parking in a garage like this is fairly safe.The one time my car was broken into, it was parked in my driveway in the sleepy suburb of Dublin, California. It's a hassle, to be sure, and feels assaultive, but it is the reality of life.One thing to note for visitors this time of year, the garage can get full in the shopping days before Christmas, so have some other nearby garages in mind, just in case.Edited: 2 years ago "
When we parked our car downtown in October. We left nothing in the car and left the center console and glove compartment open and left the back area cover open. They prolly thought the towel/blanket was covering something of value

Oh, wait...""FBI Stats Show Uptick in Nation's Violent Crime; Fremont Leads Bay Area Jump"" …cbslocal.com/2017/…"
"My car was bashed into on the 8th floor last night. I had picked up my girlfriend from the airport and left her suitcase covered in the back with a tarp. I've been parking at the garage for 50 years and I naively thought this garage was safe.. Boy, was I wrong.They have ONE guy ""monitoring"" the cars. He said this goes on EVERY single day, and this is the disturbing part. It's mostly the same people. Druggies.I don't understand why they don't hire more security people for this garage."
">>I don't understand why they don't hire more security people for this garage.<<And you'd be happy to pay the higher rates that would result? The 450 Sutter Garage is valet only and thus more secure.I wouldn't assume ANY garage is ""safe"" -- even my condo parking garage averages about 2 break-ins a year, and it's limited (in theory) to building residents."
Nothing will happen about this until citizens start screaming to their elected officials and make their dissatisfaction known at the polls. But there have been a few editorials lately: sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Au…
"I agree with SFSusan. Valet only garages tend to be a bit safer. These have less entrances to enter and exit as pedestrians. And some have car only garages that limit only the valet to get to your car.As others have said, leave nothing in your car. Anything can be misconstrued as something of value. i.e. A folded piece of paper could be an envelop with a check or cash. Or a blanket could be perfect for a homeless person. Most of the break-ins are smash and grab. They don't typically go into your trunk.Always file a police report online so the city can track issues."
"I posted this link on a new thread I started about car burglaries, but not everyone on some threads thinks this is a problem worth fretting about.…sfgate.com/crime/…People who raise this subject and try to warn visitors sometimes get accused of being alarmists. Anyone who thinks that should come to this thread, where alarmism isn’t the issue, but reality is. Percentages, the odds of being a victim, which addresses have the worst records, don’t mean a thing to anyone who has lost everything they brought, everything they bought, important documents or irreplaceable computer or camera data, along with any pleasure from their trip and any innocence about the world they live in. All they know is that they came here hoping to leave their heart in San Francisco, and everything else got stolen."
"FRR I don't think it is wrong to warn people at every opportunity -- it is like a slowly growing epidemic and if the poster from Egypt has been parking there for 50 years -- surely there are enough folks telling him to not keep things under a tarp. Also, I would not do the same thing in Egypt. We have reduced using the car on weekends in SF -- we take the bus or lyft just for this very reason and if I have to drive I keep the driver's side window slightly ajar so the miscreant can see inside that there is nothing in there. I don't know if that is a good or bad idea but hey I'm trying"
"SF has turned into a cesspool. My advice for SF is to avoid it, but if you must visit, best forget about the car."
"40winx, most posters here are trying to be helpful and constructive, whatever their actual opinion about this problem. Please try to do the same."
">>not everyone on some threads thinks this is a problem worth fretting about.<<I think it can be both things -- a problem that needs to be addressed successfully and yet at a certain point, not worth fretting about.It is worth warning people about, along with providing information on how to reduce the chances of being a victim.Yes, if it happens to you, statistics don't matter because it was 100%. That number doesn't mean anything to anyone else, though, however meaningful it is to you. When folks post information like ""the majority of people don't have a problem"", it's meant to reassure visitors that they can come to SF and will, in all likelihood, NOT have their car broken into, not that there is no problem.And at a certain point, all we can do is advise visitors of the problem and the steps they can take to reduce their own risk. It's no more useful for visitors to fret about the problem than it is for them to worry about earthquakes or aggressive panhandlers."
"The homeless get a bad rap for car break ins. I say it's more the lower income folk from the outskirts. They cruise into SF, smash your window, then drive away with your gear.That is what I see, anyways."
">>> That is what I see, anyways. <<<You have seen several car break-ins and you somehow knew what income bracket the perps were in??You are full of it."
40 winx a troll. Makes a new account then post stupidity.
"When you simply post a link to an article that talks about a percentage increase in crime without providing anything like the odds of actually being the victim of the crime, that's scare-mongering. If I'm in a city where last year there was one murder, and this year there were two murders, then the headlines are going to blare, ""MURDER RATE DOUBLES!"", yet the chances that anyone will be murdered are still minuscule,.Edited: 2 years ago "
"To those who think somehow I'm trolling or stupid for warning people to avoid, SF, then you are naïve. And by the way, instead of simply insulting posters, how about some constructive advice of your own? Frisco: Nobody in the entire state of California calls SF ""Frisco"", so who are you really? Anyway, back to San Francisco. OVER the last decade it has really gone downill. Crime is way up, bums are everywhere crappin in the streets, panhandlers are aggressive, and costs are really high thanks to all th taxes tacked onto restaurant bills and hotels ..to feed the homeless, etc. Mass transit is not very convenient, yet a car is crazy for all the reasons mentioned. Go ahead and mock what you don't know...you'll see when you get there. With so many great tourist options nearby, I would pass on SF unless you really need to check it off your bucket list. But when your 4 year old kid points to a bum and asks why he's going poo poo onthe street, you will perhaps remember this warningEdited: 2 years ago "

"40winx - where are you from? San Francisco has the same issues many urban centers are dealing with. And really - I'd point out that your example of a 4 year old kid seeing a homeless person would be a great teaching moment for them to appreciate all that they have and not take it for granted. I don't actually feel as if serious crime is way up. I've been walking to many venues along Market (including mid-Market) and have seen things improving there (thanks is no small part to Twitter and Dolby Labs anchoring the area). I will completely agree that car break-ins are up - and those of us who live here have been sending that message loudly to our civic representatives. But to tell people to stay away because of these issues seems overkill. Would you avoid Rome, Paris, NYC, etc. for the same reasons?"
I think this is what everyone is worried about:https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/human-…
"sfimporter. SF is no Rome. A city is only as civil as its inhabitants. It is because of this misplaced tolerance of lawlessness, that I have increasingly found reasons not to visit the city. Citizens who tolerate this blight, are part of the problem."
"** Frisco: Nobody in the entire state of California calls SF ""Frisco"", so who are you really? **You talkin at me, 40winx? I’m a native, lifelong San Franciscan, born and raised here, went to school and college here, always lived and worked here or nearby, and have been all over California, Nevada, and Utah. I know San Francisco and the Bay Area not only as a resident, but as a former postal employee, police and fire dispatcher, and fire inspector – in other words, inside out and upside down.If you total up the posts from SFSusanW, belomiser, simba, sfimporter, mini, chinita, Puter, me, and other locals here (apologies if I neglected anyone) you might be surprised at the number. IOW, we’ve all been here awhile, and even if we don't always agree with each other, we all know what we’re talking about. We’re not fly-by-night, drop-in, drive-by shooters, and we all have our locations posted. Soooo … who are YOU?"
