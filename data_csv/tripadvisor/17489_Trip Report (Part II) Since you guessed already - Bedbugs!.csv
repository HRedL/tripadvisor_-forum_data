"Okay, I left off last with my daughter finding out that the bug from the bed her boyfriend was holding was not the first he'd found. Not a pretty sight! After we got out wits about us, we began carefully looking at the comforter. None of the covers had been rustled since we had just gotten there. What we found was, well, quite disturbing!Since there was only lamplight in the bedrooms, I got out the flashlight and shined it on the bedding. Almost instantly, you could see MULTIPLE bugs scattering away from the light. Still not sure what to make of the situation, we began to carefully pull back the layers of bedding. On the back side of the pillow sham, I found very small (grain of salt sized) whiteish nits crawling around. YUK! I grabbed a paper towel and plucked on up to see if I could make out what it was. No luck, but when I did it with of the larger ones, it splatted bright red. That's when I knew what the little buggers wanted for dinner! We found them mostly around the binding of the mattress and even saw some crawling on teh headboard nearest the mattress.At this point is was around 12:45am. I decided to call the office number and got an answering service. I told them the situation and they called the on-duty night person. We were told that becasue of the hour they would not be able to move us & that they would be intouch first thing in the morning. Not knowing where they would move us to, we zipped up all our bags & put them onto the glass top tables, leaving them in that unit. Luckilly the little one was sleeping at g'mas down the road and we didn't have to wake her when we decided to do the same.At 10a the following morning (much later than what I consider ""first thing in the morning""), I called the Blind Pass Office again. I was told that she had gotten my message from last night, but because it was Sunday & the exterminator didn't open until Monday, she'd have to get back with me. Not an option, lady! I told her that were not staying in the unit, but were with my parents on W. Gulf. She seemed surprised why we weren't still there! She asked that I allow her to make a phone call and she would call me right back.Ten minutes later, she returned my call only to state that she couldn't get her manager on the phone. She did make a wise executive decision to allow us to stay in one of their ""In case of"" units. She told me where I could collect the key and we moved.We moved into a unit that was very nice and had a screened lanai with a private path to the pool.WE NEVER HEARD FROM THE MANAGEMENT to see if our new unit was acceptable, they didn't offer to help us move our bags, or anything!! How very disappointing! Since I had rented through the owner directly, I decided to call him to let him know what was going on. I seemed to be that the Condo people were just going to have someone come out and spray & let us keep on staying in that unit! The Owner was flabbergasted & disgusted. He said he would make sure the bedding was thrown away immediately & thanked me for calling.On Monday, we realized that we had left something in the other unit's fridge and I sent the older ones to collect it. They said that all the paintings, electrical plate covers & stuff were off all the walls and that the beds were standing on end. After Googling the bugs, it says that carpet removal might be necessary as well!Not enough time to continue now, but I promise more positive reporting is on the way!!"
Oh thats horrible! Bed bugs are tough to get rid of. One of the biggest problems is that they get carried from one unit to the other from the maid carts and vacuums and cleaning supplies.
"I also read that they can evade extermination by crawling through the walls by way of electrical wiring, water pipes, etc. We met some owners who were down for the week that had a unit in the same building. I let them know what was going on in case they wanted to a have a preventative treatment, if there is such.I just hope that none have come home with us! The larvae are VERY small and I suppose very portable."
"I just feel sick reading this. That is horrible. I would never have spent that night in that place, ever. I can't believe the management didn't make better arrangements - seriously, that alone will make me never stay there. Never, never put your luggage or clothes on a bed - keep it on a luggage rack or dresser, etc. Inspect when you get home. We are in an epidemic of bedbugs, I expect to hear more stories such as this.Yuck, i'm pretty grossed out. Can't wait to hear the good part. "
Why is there an epidemic? Are bedbugs like lice? That is very disturbing to hear how management handled that. Bedbugs will be the first thing I check for when I get there. Holy moly that is gross. 
"What makes matters worse is that I was soooo depressed about coming home, I've already booked for a 4-day in January at Waterside Inn!!! "
Where did you get the cactus juice? Do they sell it in Sanibel?
"I ordered the Cactus Juice directly from their site. I think it was like $8/bottle for 6oz. The also have a product in creme form that contains sunscreen. I will say that at times when it was realyy buggy, we doubled-up with a DEET product. I was so worried that the little one would be very reactive to the bites like I am, but so far as I can tell, she only got one small bite.I was so impressed with the stuff, that if I had time on the way out, I was gonna stop at Bailey's and talk to their manager about maybe stocking it. (I am in NO WAY affiliated with Cactus Juice - just offering my opinion)"
"I just found store locations on the Cactus Juice website.......Island Pharmacy2330 Palm Ridge rd 12Sanibel, FL 33957 US239-472-6188  . . . . . . . . . . .  Forever Green Ace H/ware2025 periwinkle WaySanibel Island, FL 33957 US239.472.5354 "
I think the owner deserves kudos for his prompt and thorough attack on the problem. These are stubborn and nasty critters that spread easily. ICK. 
"I agree about the Owner. I decided to let him know about the situation because the on-site teamed seemed so lackadasical about the whole thing. I felt like they were just going to have a spraying done & probably not even call the owner about it. Are there regulations about reporting infestations?Granted I am from South Carolina and we bleed hospitality, but I expected much more from their staff. Like I said, not even a phone call to see if the new unit was okay, or to see if it had bugs!! When I checked out, all they said is ""we hope you enjoyed your stay"". The same woman checked us in & out, and took my phone complaint.I am a very easy going person and am absolutley not a letter writing person. This may have to be an exception, though. Sadly, I love Sanibel so much, that I would probably chalk this up to a limited bad experience and go there (BP Condos) again. Just making sure I check the unit before signing on the dotted line."
"I forgot to add that the infested unit had been occupied the week before we got it. Sure hope they didn't use the 2nd bedroom! (Just in case, I will say that we were in the E Building)"
More than ou ever wanted to know about Bed Bugs.... http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/bedbugs/
"Oh WOW...Your case was soo much worse than outs. My hubby pulled back the lines and mattress and did not see anything like you described! Out of the 3-4 that he picked off, all but 1 was dead and tiny in size. I don't believe we put our suitcase in that room, think we unpacked from the kids adjoining room. But I did put the cases on the bed in there! Holy crap what do I do now that I am home?????? YUCK!!!::::scratchin' and a itchin' all over again!::::"
"I remembered that Dateline NBC had done some reports a few years back and I Googled them. They said to make sure the clothes are washed & dried in hot cycles, adding boric acid if you have it. Also, recommended high heat added to the suitcase (leaving in the trunk of your car?) and vaccuming it thoroughly.I took a video and still pics of the critters and may have that posted in a few days."
I can't get over this trip report! Thank you for sharing... I've read some horror stories on TripAdvisor and I always appreciate the reports of posters who make the best of their situation and their vacation (after addressing it and trying to resolve the issue with management or ownership of course).Looking forward to Part III. 
You poor thing!!!!I am so sorry to read this.....I'm itching and grossed out. I worry about this as hubby travels A LOT and there is really a problem in some areas of the country. I think you deserve a RE-DO trip to Sanibel.Well Marteach...and now you have had a Blindpass management problem!!!! Hmmm I hope you shared your displeasure with the owner of the condo on how the mangement people were handling your crisis...and I do consider that a CRISIS!!!!I sure hope you found some nice shells!!!! Will be peeking back in for next installement!
Wow maybe I should be glad that we had the problem with management at Blind Pass and won't be staying there in the spring!!! Devine intervention!!
I am so sorry for your experience- it was a totally unacceptable response and will not serve them well. Since the owner was so responsive you might want to let him/her know one of things they need to do is get bed bugs covers that zip around entire mattress and box spring. Key to even hoping to win this battle. Never thought DDT would look so good:-( I am so sad about this for everyone...
"That whole thing totally grossed me out. Yuck! You certainly handled it better than I would have been able to. I've stayed at BP condos a couple of times years ago, and actually liked it very well. It was a little trek to the beach, but a pretty walk. I also liked the large rooms in the condos. The landscaping was just beautiful there. The only negative thing, was no management people there after evening or on weekends. I rented through an owner each time and the first stay, I arrived very late. Even though I had a map and had researched very well on the internet, it was so dark that we couldn't find the condo. I actually found the screened porch, but couldn't get in that way because of the lock inside. When I tried going around to the other side, I was trying to get in someone elses condo. :-) A man came out and help me find the right door. When it is dark there, it is VERY dark! I'm glad you got more favorable results from the owner. I'm sure he must have been horribly upset by the whole thing. Thankfully you have made all of us more aware. I hope you soon forget your bad experience. http://sanibeltoots.blogspot.com"
"Sorry to hear about your ordeal. Unfortunately I usually Google ""bedbugs"" for any hotel or complex we are considering renting anywhere these days. It's a widespread concern..."
