"Hello,I am very sadly in the beginning stages of having to cancel our trip. I'd like to rebook for September or October, but with all the uncertainity, I am not sure that's very realistic. I wish it was, I'd happily book in a heartbeat!I have booked several tours and train tickets to and from Venice, so I guess I need to try to get a refund for everything. My Clock Tower Tour tickets included the following statement:""THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING VIVATICKETWe remind you that it is not possible to cancel or modify your transaction as, pursuant to art. 55, paragraph 1 lett. b), of the Legislative Decree 6 October 2005 n. 206 (the so-called ""Consumer Code"") to the tickets purchased, THE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL referred to in art. 64 and following of the same Consumer Code.""Does this mean that a refund isn't possible? Anyone know what my options are for this tour? Thank you in advance.Edited: 5:33 pm, April 13, 2020 "
"Hi teacher91,I am so sorry about your trip... I know how you enjoyed planning it. Sorry, I cannot help you with this particular cancellation...Stay safe and healthy,Nora"
teacher91:I don't think you have re-visited the website and read the cancellation / rebooking / refund announcement regarding COVID-19. Note - many cancellation policies have been incremental and businesses have been gradually adding dates that are eligible.
"Thank you Nora. Yes. I was SO excited about our trip to Italy and Venice in particular. I hope it will happen someday.Hi Drew. You are correct. I have not, but I will! I was just looking at the email I received after booking. Thank you for the heads up!Edited: 7:13 pm, April 13, 2020 "
If you do obtain a refund then thoughts of rebooking in September or October are no doubt attractive. These are both excellent months in which to visit Venice but given all the uncertainties about the coronavirus pandemic I think waiting for 2021 is a more realistic plan. I know I have abandoned my annual visit this year.
"Everyone is updating refund and cancellation policies...and if nothing, call them. I’m sure they will work with you, especially if just want to travel at a later time.."
"I think the updating process is ongoing. I'm going to wait to the end of the month and give the places a chance to figure out where things stand at this point. i really prefer to rebook for the end of September, rather than cancel completely for 2020. Hopefully, that will be a possiblity. #GoAwayCovid19 Thank you all.Edited: 4:08 pm, April 15, 2020 "
"Hi Teacher,I have been following your threads for a while now. I too was planning to visit Italy (Naples, Capri, Ischia and Venice) in May/June this year. By the way, I am a former teacher and I also live in Texas. But I suppose there are a lot of former teachers living in Texas! Ha! Anyway, I can't help with your current question but I wanted to tell you that I have had to unwind all of my plans for our trip. I have most of it completed except for the airlines. I still have to work on that. We plan to re-book as well but I have no idea when right now. We are holding off until things are more settled. Stay in touch. Let us know how your plans progress. You can PM me if you like.Elaine"
"Do not rebook anything for a few more months as it clearly a matter that WHO think will not be easy to find vaccine for, and I imagine any tourism will be very, very controlled in the beginning of opening up any city for tourism. Plus more clarity is required from travel insurers as I am guessing many will want to exclude COVID and cost of COVID quarantines from regular insurance cover ."
"As a professional Botanist (retired) I have to say no certainty whatsoever that any vaccine, to combat this particular coronavirus, will be found at any time in the future. Viruses can, and do, mutate, so as soon as you think you have found a solution you are back starting all over again searching for an answer."
As it happens every year with the Influenza Virus.
"@10 why did they cancel the biggest beer festival in Munich this year? Italy health system is not like the Germans it will not break down as easy, most of the people that get the virus it kills the older generation of the population in people in care homes and also people with health issues say respiratory they catch it too late, I would think Italy is a dead duck for the summer season from travel from abroad, they say Sweden in 10 days they will be close to herd immunity from the virus.Edited: 3:09 pm, April 21, 2020 "
"I am slowly working on my refunds. I had booked our airfare with AA points. American Airlines have refunded my points, but not the $$$ yet.  I have gotten a refund for my Hidden Venice tour, but nothing else at this point. Although a couple of the vendors have been in touch and said I could get a refund. I bought the cheapest train tickets, so not sure if these are refundable. I guess I can ask. When I bought them I could not forsee that I wouldn't be traveling to Italy. :/I also have tickets for a Secret Itineraries Tour for the Doge's Palace and a clock tower tour. It doesn't appear that the website has been updated to reflect the current closing, so I'm unsure if I can get a refund or not. Right now, we are tentatively hoping to reschedule for 2021.Edited: 11:40 am, May 05, 2020 "
"teacher91>>I bought the cheapest train tickets, so not sure if these are refundable.<<The two train companies - Trenitalia and Italo - have both posted a link to their COVID-19 refund policy on their English language homepage. For Trenitalia: Click on the big information ""i"" next to: Refund for Journey CancellationFor Italo: Click on the link next to: Information regarding Coronavirus COVID-19"
"Hi Drew,Thank you so much for this information. I still can't believe I won't be starting my vacation next week. I hope everyone reading is well!"
"Hi Teacher91.. So disappointing for you having to cancel/delay, sorry to hear that.My daughter was in Venice the week building up to the Lockdown. The days before she left many museums closed due to the virus. She had purchased a ticket to the Arsenal museum? Although she had partially used the pass for some of the museums she could not visit all due to the abrupt closure due to Covid. She was told by a member of staff to apply for a refund. Upon her return she did apply and recently received a refund. It did take 6 weeks to be refunded but that is understandable given the circumstances."
Thank you Pudlian. I still can't believe we aren't going. Stay well!
"Think positive, teacher! You will be going next year! Same as us... Don’t be sad...All the best to you and your family!Nora"
Thank you Nora! Wishing you and your Mr. well!
"Same to you, Teacher!"
