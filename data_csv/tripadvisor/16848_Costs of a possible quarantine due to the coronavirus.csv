"Hello people good night.My wife and I intend to celebrate our wedding anniversary on a trip to London / Paris on March 18th.Even if we take all care with hand hygiene, we can contract the coronavirus if someone sneezes on our side.We are about thirty years old, and I am not concerned about the damage of the disease itself, however, I am concerned about a possible quarantine.We have travel insurance, but it doesn't seem to cover all the expenses of a quarantine.Does anyone know how the costs of a possible quarantine in the France work?Here in Brazil, where we live, the state itself provides this type of medical care free of charge.Thanks for your help"
"Hi, and congratulations to you and your wife on your upcoming anniversary!Too bad the timing is not so good.I suppose you're referring to a health quarantine in a hospital. If I'm not wrong being a foreigner you'll be responsible to pay for the care. But if you have travel insurance your policy should be able to cover the costs in the event of a health crisis or quarantine situation. It depends so you'll need to ask your travel insurance company.  My and my family's travel policy covers for that reason but we're not going to be able to travel anymore as planned."
"In Paris there will be no quarantine in hospital unless you have a serious case that requires constant hospital care. There are not enough beds for all sick people and mild cases do not require 24/7 surveillance. People are supposed to self-quarantine at home. Not sure how that works if you are a tourist.If you need to be hospitalized then check your travel insurance. Regardless of virus I would not travel with a trip insurance that does not cover a hospital stay.Edited: 6:10 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"Thanks for the help, guys.I looked for information with my travel insurance, and was informed that medical and hospital expenses would be covered until a possible diagnosis of the coronavirus, after that I would have to check how it works in each country. Hence, it was the reason for my concern.Anyway, we are prone to travel, as I believe that with the right care we can return home unharmed."
"The problem will be if we follow Milan’s example and you can not leave. If that’s the case, you will have to pay for your own lodgings until you can return home. These quarantines are intended to slow down the spread, so hospitals are not overwhelmed, so you may effected, even if you are young and not concerned."
Travel insurance is excluding ALL payments related to the epidemic now. i.e. if you get Corona it will not cover the hospital costs because 'costs associated with an epidemic are excluded from the policy' -- our medigap policy covers us for emergency care for 60 days outside the country -- that is what we will have if we travel and need care -- travel insurance is mostly worthless in this situation.
"janettravelsAs my partner and I are going to France next week I checked if we are covered. They will cover any hospital bills, although we have EHIC cards, so should be covered. They will also cover accommodation expenses should we be quarantined. There are also conditions as to when the policy is bought, soyou wouldn’t be covered if you bought after a certain date.They will only payout if your government adviseagainst all but essential travel to the area you are visiting. Therefore, you really do need to check with your own insurance company as they differ."
"Herman - could you please check this statement - it seems to be the reverse of what might be expected:""They will only pay out if your government advise against all but essential travel to the area you are visiting.""I would imagine that if you travel, against the warning of your government, then the insurance companies will NOT payout."
"GRACorrect. If you decide not to travel, but your government isn’t advising not to go, then you are probably not going to be covered. That’s how it works with U.K. insurance companies."
The US companies simply exclude any costs related to epidemics
"janettravels In the U.K. it really depends on the policy you buy. As my partner and I are no longer spring chickens, we have pre existing conditions, plus go on a cruise at least once a year, we tend not to buy the basic one. We’d rather be safe than sorry."
