"Loads of comments in various topics about when travel , tourism and flights might start again ...and when might we return to 'normal' Of course some of this will be determined by Government policy - especially in respect of something like quarantine periods from particulate countriesHowever it will also be determined by the decision of an individual that it is safe to travelWhat conditions / assurances /restrictions would you need to see in place before travelling or flying again"
"I would like to know that there are treatments for covid which have a high success rate of both avoiding death and the very awful effects of having the virus.Preferably there is a vaccine but I am not confident there will be one available. I am willing to be an early vaccinated person - I am willing to take that risk in order to be able to travel.I will only come to Barbados when I can go on the beach all day, go to a happy hour and eat in restaurants. I am perfectly happy to have to wear a mask on the bus and in stores. Part of the joy of visiting Barbados is how social it is. Without the social vibe I would be less interested in travel.I have reservations for the first week in February and I am not confident about travel even then. Time will tell."
Probably if/when there is a vaccine....
"I can’t see me ever getting on a plane without a vaccination. We are due to fly out at the end of November but I can’t see that happening. I have severe asthma and have stopped breathing once already, an experience I’m not keen to repeat. We live five hours by ferry away from the mainland and I really don’t like that journey. Normally we fly to Glasgow on a tiny Twin Otter. I’d be worried about being in such close confinement on there for an hour. Normally a shopping trip to Glasgow is a big thing for me but I think they are a thing of the past. I honestly can’t see us holidaying anywhere for a very long time without a proven vaccination."
We have flights booked for Christmas to Barbados and I am 50/50 at the moment I really want to go but I am really worried being in a crowded airport that before I even get on the plane:-(And of course after that holiday I am not sure what happen as alot of travel insurance are saying they will not cover Coronavirus our Christmas holiday should be OK as we booked it in February.However without insurance I would not consider travelling so will not be booking anything else in the near future.Unless there is a vaccineI am not really sure how welcome we will be as we have such a high number of deaths here in the UK.
"We have flights and accommodation booked for December for a month (through to mid January). We’re really keen to come back to Barbados. By then, hopefully rates of infection (and recurrence) may be lower. I say hopefully but we just don’t know. If infection rates are high that would be a concern and I wouldn’t want to travel.  Then there’s insurance - I wouldn’t travel without this being valid for coronavirus (we have annual worldwide insurance continually in place). I haven’t checked with our company what they might cover and they possibly haven’t decided yet. Of course, in addition the FCO would have to lift their current travel advisory.Then there’s the airport and how they plan to handle considerable numbers of people queuing to process security etc. Then there’s how the airline are going to manage the flight with practicalities like numbers of people using the bathrooms, spacing, food and drink etc. That’s assuming they haven’t cancelled the flight! Then there’s the potential of a vaccine. I’d be prepared to have this, if it were available. I’d continue to have my annual flu jab as I’ve found this helps me to stay well from other viruses whilst travelling. And most importantly, it’s whether the lovely people of Barbados are prepared to have us back from the UK when the whole thing has been so badly managed and we have such high infection rates. I wouldn’t want to put them at further risk. I’d be able to manage two weeks self isolation after our trip, but not on arrival to Barbados (if this were required). In essence, I’ll weigh up all of the above factors and make. a decision nearer the time."

"Until there is a vaccine and treatment we won't be flying at all as today we have had a letter from our travel insurers to say any holiday booked after 20th March we will not be covered against Covid-19. I expect this will eventually apply to all insurance companies so people won't be able to travel unless, of course, they are happy to go away without it.W-D"
I think you can say every insurer in the UK will already be excluding Covid-19 unless the single trip policy was taken out before March. As for Annual policies most if not all will be excluding the virus on trips taking place after March. The annual policy is not a single trip policy it treats every individual trip as a new risk. As an example an illness diagnosed after taking out the annual policy but before an upcoming trip has to be disclosed and the insurer can then impose terms.
Post #6 ...Andy .... I like the sentimentsPost #8 ...John ...so true and I think for many it could be the most important factor
"It feels like this virus is defining a risk which is worse than it deserves. In the UK road injuries run at more than 25.000 pa, deaths due to flu run at 17,000 pa, but we don't ban cars and force 2metre distancing because of those risks. I know that more people drown while hill walking than do while scuba diving and the unexpected sometimes just happens. The insurers are being dumb and should be forced to just take the minimal risk that Covid-19 not influenza, or slipping on wet floors is likely to put us in need of aid while away from home.Barbados had 16 deaths due to motor accidents compared to 7 due to Covid-19. Of course the management of the infection was far better than management of dire driving, but I happily drive on Barbados roads and would again.I am no spring chicken, but the risks of flying with HEPA filters and sensible denial of boarding to those with active colds and coughs or with temperatures beyond a degree north of normal would get things moving for me.Denial of low risk accident and medical cover along with trying to dodge every claim is how insurers maintain profits and it deserves to be outlawed. Insure us or get out of the market and give the better companies a way to stay there and stay in business. How about low cost government cover? They cover us at home and don't whine about how unfair it is.My guess is that food poisoning is far worse risk for most of us than Covid-19 is."
"It basically comes down to each individuals level of confidence and how they perceive the ongoing risk levels. I am a bit more cavalier in my attitude to risk and will base any decisions on a number of factors. I am a fit and healthy 52 yr old. We are due back in Barbados in March ‘21. I am, currently, 90% confident that will happen. We are booked for France in July (not happening), Spain in Sept (90% certain won’t happen) and US in November (60% against at the moment). I listened to a statistician the other day (who advises the UK govt. David Spiegelhalter, Cambridge University). On analysis (and I’m paraphrasing) he says Covid is a disease of the over 75s. (Sorry if you over 75). So a child has higher or same risk crossing the road. The risk increases with age, and other factors, but is more or less no greater than any other risks we face on a daily basis. On that basis, me personally, I’ll take my chances. I agree, that is my subjective take on what he said and others will disagree. In terms of actually flying, if I’m told it’s safe, I’ll go. If I need to wear a mask or get my temp checked or queue a bit longer then fair enough. It’s not airborne (we are told) so recirculated air on the aircraft should not be a factor. If Covid has reinforced anything it should be personal hygiene, which sadly, many are not good at and airports and aircraft are terrible places for it. If everyone is sensible and takes precautions then we may all be flying and travelling a bit quicker."
Gregory will your travel medical insurance cover you if you get covid in the States?
"NC. If I’m honest, I haven’t looked that far ahead."
"NC. Now that you prompted me. I’ve checked my insurance and because my trip was booked before Mar 20th for the US, I/we would be covered, even for Covid. However, I’m 60% certain it won’t happen due to airline schedules etc based on the flights booked. #10 - Agreed."
"<< ""Under what circumstances would YOU feel it safe to fly"" >>“Safe” is a relative term that I have to come to grips with on a regular basis, so I evaluate ""safety"" using a very specific set of criteria.I’m a cave diver. I put scuba gear on and purposely swim into caves. Deep caves. Pitch black caves. Way back in caves. Spending hours in an environment that is completely inhospitable to human life. With no direct access to the surface. And often with a significant decompression obligation, so I couldn’t exit the water earlier even if I did have access to the surface.Most people would look at all that and determine that cave diving is not safe. But, to me, determining whether something is “safe” involves four specific things: informed understanding, willing acceptance, and effective management of well-defined risks. As of right now., I don't feel we even really UNDERSTAND the risk of air travel. Do we mean the risk that someone with the virus boards the same plane as us? Do we mean risk of us acquiring the virus on a plane? Risk of us spreading the virus to someone else on a plane? Risk of contracting the virus in a destination we are flying to? Risk of air travel being a vector to bring the virus to the destination? Risk of air travel being a vector for bringing the virus back from the destination?I can easily make cave diving safe because I do understand, willingly accept, and can effectively manage the well-defined risks involved.I can’t say I can confidently do that for air travel right now. Hell, I can’t currently say I can do that for a trip to our local grocery store right now.Edited: 10:40 am, May 14, 2020 "
"It would be worse holidaying in the uk imagine the crowds in Cornwall,Wales,the lakes,York etc nah not for me ,fingers ,toes crossed hoping to be in bim in July the best place on the planet ,fed up listening to all doom and gloom merchants when ye numbers up its up"
#10 I'm with my namesake in most of what he says. I think he is being a bit harsh about insurers. What is needed is for governments to take up the risk/cost of Covid related claims that may arise in the future providing the person was travelling to a country not on a restricted list.That sorted I would be more than happy to take my chances.In the meantime we are booked to go to Canary Islands in January without Covid-19 cover. From our experience when we were there in February when this virus arrived we felt very safe.I do think a lot of countries (UK included) have over-reacted with the lockdown. Closing businesses completely when they should have insisted to remain open Social Distancing has to be possible and maintained. An example is Golf - they can now open providing club house is closed and you can only play as pairs or singles. That could easily have been introduced at the beginning. Same with tennis garden centres etc
I agree with John. We are booked (plane and house) for Feb and March. We are waiting to hear if our travel medical insurance will cover us for covid. If they don't maybe Barbados (or any country wanting our business) will come up with a plan within their health plan to cover visitors. We don't want to travel without being covered (especially to the States because of the cost of their health system).
"Gregory, post 11 I completely agree with you but have to try to be tactful (this time) !Covid 19 is a disease that mainly kills older people or ones with pre existing medical conditions.The Winton Professor of Risk from Cambridge University pointed out that children run more risk from dying on their journey to school, than from dying after catching Covid 19 at school.As we are in the vulnerable age group, as are a lot of people on this forum, then no personally we won’t risk going on a plane until we have had the vaccination,or survived the virus and built up immunity.But if we were under 60 and in good health,like other posters, then we would be on a plane and back to Barbados asap !"
I would fly under 2 hours today. Mainly since I could drive home if a illness developed. Would hope the drugs or vaccines work before flying further. Be safe.
"Vaccines and risk assessment ( particularly age related) seem to be (so far) two key factors and they are both towards my list of matters to considerReported today in the UK media that the Oxford developed vaccine trial has run into a few (as predicted problems) ...in that with the drop in infections they are struggling a little to get volunteers in situations where they might get infectedSo, as well as working with researchers in Kenya they are now looking to increase the number of volunteers in the NHS & Social Care - where the risk remain higher.At present something like .35% of the UK population has been 'officially' infected but other studies have suggested in the general community it may be lower at 0.27%Not really that surprising when you look at the whole range of numbers of people actually infected in the UK ....and the difficulty in identifying those people - due to lack of testing in the general population On the topic of antibody tests .... see here Post #24Also reported as headline news today in the UK press that the infection rate in London has dropped to 24 cases per day and that the virus could even be wiped out by June ....given the number of infections in London is halving every 3.54 days This is in line with other virologists who believe the virus could burn out - or at least drop to the levels associated with normal seasonal fluWhen you drill down into the report - it is a modelling prediction based on the present rate of decline. However this modelling has been performed by Cambridge University and reviewed by PHE rather than Imperial College - whose models under Neil Ferguson have been questioned by a number of expertsSo maybe Londoners will be able to return to Barbados before those in say NE England !!!"
"<< "" However this modelling has been performed by Cambridge University and reviewed by PHE rather than Imperial College "" >>As British statistician George Box famously opined: ""All models are wrong... but some are useful."""
"Feel it safe to fly....If I had to fly today. I would touch as little as possible through the airport. Wash my hands every chance I get as well as hand sanitize often. Wipe down my whole seat, tray, seat belt, buckle. EVERYTHING around me. Which has been my routine. So thats nothing new. Who wants to get sick on vacation. Even with a simple cold. I have done this for years. What will be new procedures for me-I will bring no carry on, just a simple bag at my feet. After my flight I will wipe down my suitcase. Before leaving the airport change clothes and bag seperately. Of course wearing a mask till I am out the door. Now, when will I feel safe to fly with all these precautions? Proven treatments, a cure to travel internationally.If I have antibodies and assurance I wont get sick or anyone else sick. Even feeling safe if I am not wanted and or my travel experience will be a continus string of precautions... I will have to consider if it will be worth it. If I had to travel domestic right now I would have concern. But I think with caution and precautions it can be done with minimal risk.Edited: 3:20 pm, May 15, 2020 "
"I agree with you, VeronaNJtraveler. I would like to see a treatment, or at least have a vaccine.My main concerns are not with my being careful about what I touch. Circulating air is known to blow the virus particles around and infect people. This is lessened by mask usage, of course.Medical experts are still figuring out symptoms and COVID-caused illnesses that were not previously diagnosed. There is so much we still don't know. The level of contagiousness of this illness is off the charts, unlike what many virologists say they have ever seen. (So comparing it to food poisoning or auto accidents is not really fitting - those are not highly contagious, and don't kill medical professionals treating the victims).I'll stay home until we know more. And I sure wouldn't want the chance of spreading this horrifying illness to others.VeronaNJ I think of you every day when I look at my Earthworks pottery! I used one of the plates for dinner tonight, and had great memories of our trip there. Sending you smiles.Edited: 12:06 am, May 16, 2020 "
"I am not a risk averse person, but as I much as I love travelling for now I will be staying put in the UK. May consider a staycation if thinks markedly improve , but unless pubs, restaurants etc in the U.K. are opened up I will be staying at home. I am concerned about contacting COVID 19 , but to travel abroad with the essential restrictions and precautionary measures in place is not for me. I’d be that stressed by the time I reach my destination at least a week of my holiday would be wasted, and then I’d start stressing about travelling home. For now I’ll sit tight!Edited: 5:56 am, May 16, 2020 "
"Chris G,Absolutely, a wise decision in these difficult times."
something else I read about travel from the UK amongst the millions of other stuff floating around the internetSomeone suggested that a test 2 weeks before air travel then a test the day before travel. Then the same two test on arrival back to UK and a sort of quarantine meaning staying at the same address for 2 weeks so you are easily traceable How the logistics and resources would work I don't really know
"Personally I would be more than happy to fly before a vaccine is found. However, I would prefer some ""cures"" to be found and for there to be some supporting social distancing in the airport and plane. Travelling business class helps in the airport and on the plane.Malaria is a killer for which no vaccine is available although pre-trip tablets help to prevent - and that does not stop people taking holidays in areas of the world where malaria can be caught."
"Got to love a couple of the comments. 1/ The rate is dropping in london so maybe Londoners will be able to travel.2/ business class is safer. 3/ only the 75 years and older or those with more existing conditions are at risk. Facts. Coronovirus has no boundaries to location or class. People way way younger are dying daily.. Try stepping into my shoes- and see things through a professionals eyes. Trust me, its not too pleasant. It's time to think of others and all stick together. Time for holidays will come all the sooner if people are sensible.Stay safe. ❤"
"#27Same here. I think it might be rather stressful for a while to travel afar. If the boarding time gets extended by 2-4 hours to accommodate for all the health checks and the same when we land, I pass. If I need to sit on a plane and wear a mask and use hand sanitizer every few minutes, I pass. I would rather stay locally or have a staycation."
"""""""and that does not stop people taking holidays in areas of the world where malaria can be caught""""""Indeed and a fair point ...BUT malaria cannot be transmitted by humans in a crowded spaceWhere malaria is present we 'stay alert' and take precautions ...and there are a number of post infection treatments available - some of which are being considered for Covid 19"
"Then there is dengue, zika and chickungunya in the Caribbean that have no vaccine or cure. All they can do for you is supportive treatment."
"<< “ Then there is dengue, zika and chickungunya ” >>Which also cannot be contracted from casual contact with an infected person in the airport at home, on the plane, at the arrival airport, in the customs line, in a shuttle/taxi on the way to the hotel, etc."
"PPM - it was me that mentioned the over 75. I was paraphrasing what a govt statistician had said, that statistically a it’s disease of the over 75s. I was not and am not suggesting other age groups are not susceptible. I know that is not the case. As others have also mentioned, there are plenty other diseases that we have learned to live with. Someone has already mentioned Malaria. I’ve had Zika. In Europe in the 70’s and 80’s we were warned against Rabies. It still exists, it is still, more or less, fatal, there is no cure and yet we hear little or nothing about it. I said previously - it comes down to traveller confidence, what the risks are and the individuals attitude to risk."
"<< “ it comes down to traveller confidence, what the risks are and the individuals attitude to risk.” >>The problem with the whole “individual attitude toward risk” argument is that with a communicable disease — unlike Zika or rabies — is that Person A’s attitude toward COVID-19 risk directly impacts the amount of COVID-19 risk that Person B is exposed to.It comes down to the fact that Person B can’t be confident that Person A isn’t an idiot.Edited: 10:28 am, May 16, 2020 "
"Fair point about malaria not transmitted between humans not thought about that.I mentioned business class not as a class/snob thing. Just that going business you avoid queues for security, go to a spacious lounge to wait and the cabin on the plane is less crowded. In otherwords a greater opportunity to practice social distancing."
"RJP - I do agree and accept that point. But we can never be sure the person next to us, in any context, is not an idiot or a mass murderer."
Fair point they do after all call standard seating cattle class implying you are rammed in together.
ppmaiden....Whilst accepting that Covid19 has no bounderies...Fact ...the rate of infection in London is presently dropping faster than all other parts of the UK. SAGE are considering regional variations .... possible ( but not likely ) that Londoners could be allowed to travel ...I said it as a humourous commentFact... Business Class ...discounting all the other factors mentioned...can be safer if the crew switch the air circulation system so that fresh air always flows from the front of the aircraft . If the aircraft has First Class then it would be 'safer' than Business As we learn more and more about the way Covid 19 affects different parts of society ...clear evidence is emerging that certain sections (eg BAME ) are affected more than others as it is with people living in 'deprived' areas
"Further report in the press today that a regional approach to lockdown release in England is being more seriously considered. Unlikely in the short term but could open up possibility of London airports operating more flights sooner than regional airports This of course assumes we have somewhere to fly to without quarantine !!! Whilst a little out of date, the figures for deaths up to 24th April show a total of 27000 of which 24000 were aged 65+.... and only 332 were under 45This confirms what we probably already knew ...that flying anywhere is safer if the plane is full of those under 45 !!!"
"mpd,We know that in general, this is a disease which seriously affects the elderly and infirm,rather than the young and healthy.Such a shame that the debate in the UK has become so political,by Labour,the Unions and the BMA,who are all childish in their point scoring in this unprecedented crisis."
John ...I will not reply further in this topic as it be in great danger of going off topic Whilst guilty of that in the past I am now very keen to ensure this remains about what other TA member feel about flying into Barbados I am absolutely desperate to travel ...Barbados or any country where the restaurants and bars are open Could be a while yet ...not yet sure what risks I will take
"mpd,As and when an effective vaccine is produced, I will visit beautiful Barbados once again.Until then,simply not worth the risk for my wife and I personally.Hopefully,looking ahead, maybe President Chump and his team may have some progress on that front by the year end.Certainly,he has managed to lead the World in terms of infection and deaths from the virus with almost 90,000 dead ,so is almost duty bound to find an urgent solution in an election year,if he is to stand any chance of being re elected, such is his poor performance in handling this crisis."
