I work in the health field and just returned from three weeks in Acapulco. I saw or heard of no indications of any disease resembling influenza. It is possible that this so-called epidemic is being overblown by the media and politicians!
I just saw the local paper and as of today there were no reported cases in Acapulco. I too think the so called pandemic is being overblown by the media and politicians.
"The problem I am finding is that people that are booked to go to Mexico are all tarred with the same brush no matter what part of Mexico they are going to. Acapulco sounds like it has no H1N1 Flu, the virus is in Mexico City but what are the odds of catching it on a 2 hour stop over with a minute part of the population of the city infected?My friends that are coming to our wedding are being told by their companies that they cannot return to work for a week after they return to the UK. That's alarmist to say the least. I would imagine the chances of them contracting the flu are negigible at best. Unfortunately these companies are erring on the side of caution and making it virtually impossible to go to Mexico at the moment. I would say there's as much chance of catching it here in Southern California as there is catching it in a week in Acapulco and 2 hours in Mexico City airport.....The hype and hysteria by the media has absolutely ruined our wedding in 2 weeks time...."
"SantaMonica..Some friends of mine just returned from PV to Seattle and her boss asked her to work from home for a few days. I think it's a reasonable request given the fact the outbreak was in Mexico for the most part though I agree, the chances are very low. As much as I agree about the hype, experts simply did not know what to expect with this new strain and it's understandable to me. The fact is most folks in America who have this flu, got it in Mexico."
"I know lots of people in Acapulco with flu but it's all ""normal"" flu - no fever. Mexico is admitting that the incidence of flu is no different to an average year. I also read that the CDC says a third of U.S. cases had traveled to Mexico or been in contact with someone who has - which means two thirds have NOT!"
"cbsnews.com/stories/…main4982746.shtmlJust another of the many confirming discrepancies showing up and we hope will bring attention to this “quite alarming” virus which they may now find out is not quite as alarming as first thought… too bad, guess someone has to pay the price for overblown publicity !!!!!!!!"
"Right on, Acasun. "
"Acasun, Not only overblown, but not even true as it turns out. You cannot trust the media, IMO. They take a topic and run w/ it, and run it into the ground!"
"The more I watch the media, the more I believe that our politicians are utilizing this scare for political purposes. They should be ashamed of themselves!"
I do believe that politicians (and probably media moguls as well) owning stock in the company that makes Tamiflu pretty much explains everything.
rock on acasun and welcome to my club snork........enough said for now........your post and your final question is yes...........it is possible and they have done a number on mexico......like i said enough said.........zzaa
