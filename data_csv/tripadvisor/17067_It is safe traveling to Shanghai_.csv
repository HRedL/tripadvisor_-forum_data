"Currently founded a new virus in Wuhan, one of the city on China"
"At the moment is very limited, and for sure no problem in Shanghai. But they do not know the effect of millions of people travelling around during spring festival."
"Speak to your doctor before you go. This is what I do each time I go to China. They inform me of any outbreaks were to and were not to go. What extra shots to have or even give me antibiotics and suggests when to take.Otherwise I am vaccinated. You should in general get the usual vaccinations if your travelling such as Typhous, Hep A and B, polo and tetanus. I have had even more shots like yellow fever, measles etc.But in Shanghai it is a modern city but check the water you drink ( bottles or coke) and the main hotels will give you water for free to carry as you walk around. Don't eat at street vendors.In my numerous visits to various parts of China alone, with my family or work colleagues we have had no issue. But always take care."
"So far there have been about 50 cases among 1.4 billion people. Preliminary research results show, that human to human transmission is possible, but not very likely. You need VERY close contact with an infected person to get that virus. So far no casualties.There is definitely no yellow fewer in China :-)"
That came to my mind immediately I saw the OP just have one post.
"There is an epidemic going on in Wuhan that's similar to SARS in 2003, which is not influencing Shanghai."
Thousands of people die of the flu world wide every year. Wuhan is very far from Shanghai.
