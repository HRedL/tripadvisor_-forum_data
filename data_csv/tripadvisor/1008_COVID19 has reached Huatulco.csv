"Most unfortunate to read this. Thank you for posting.I am still disgusted with the numbers of both Americans & Canadians who insisted on traveling to various parts of Mexico for March Spring Break vacations, while being asymptomatic themselves. Selfish behavior like that is what spreads this contagion to parts of the world previously disease free.¡Diviertanse!"
"It’s a “pandemic”, LG, and the virus could have been brought in by tourist or local. Yes, we agree that the few tourists that came to Huatulco in the past 2 weeks should have stayed home. That said, except for vital services and businesses, Huatulco is on lockdown and most folks are honoring stay-at-home and social distancing when they need to go out shopping.CHEdited: 6:38 pm, April 07, 2020 "

"Correct Picaaso. Many places are in the thick of it (NYC included) and others are just beginning their curves (Huatulco included).

“The infected passengers have been returned”. So they loaded up a plane full of covid-19 positive people and flew them up north? Did I read that right? Wow!

Oh my gosh C H. That’s crazy ! I could maybe repatriation of local people. Back home. Who should follow 14 day isolation ! If your saying Huatulco is allowing domestic flights from other states. ! Yikes. Once it gets community spread. Things change dramatically. As you are well aware in New York. ! Once the medical system gets overwhelmed your doomed. We ve managed to avoid this in Winnipeg. With only 10 people in Icu beds. For a population of almost 1 million. Stay safe. Please I’ve seen the heartache on family’s in our hospital !!
"yes,this could be a disastrous turn of events, very worried the wick has been lit, be super careful and stay out of taxis! Think about that, the more I learn the worse the inevitable"
"Is a domestic flight considered from only within Mexico? Or does it include flights that connect from other countries that layover in Mex City, Oaxaca Etc. I would think the latter.Not good"
"I understand the vigilante reactions fully, but fear neither side will win either way and will probably make it worse. no good will come from tempers flaring"
"No CH- My hands have been washed, I’m safely sheltering at home and I’m actually looking for clarification on YOUR comment about flying out the people who were Covid 19 positive. That’s seems really reckless and hard to believe- but why would I expect anything else?"

I find the info available on What’s Up Huatulco to be current and relatively accurate.
"Quite so, John F, we do too!Bravos: one of many good sources.Kisha T, the beaches are closed, as are the restaurants (except for take out and delivery).

"Thanks CH. Yes I know the beaches are closed but in some areas of the world the word ""closed"" and ""social distancing"" doesn't appear to mean much to many people. That's why I am happy to see that Huatulco has taken this very seriously. I'm still hopeful for my trip in November.I really like FB What's Up Huatulco as well."
"Beavis, we were answering your question about Sol de la Costa.With regard to FB's What's Up Huatulco, yes, there are many opinions, BUT respected media outlets, including the government, also share their news and content, as well as community events and how to donate to the food banks.

Especially to me
"Dave,How does providing information to people come off as snobbish? I find the information interesting and useful.Why would you pretend to speak for “numerous people on this site” with your unwarranted comments about CH?It’s a travel site. If there’s something you don’t agree with, scroll on. No one appointed you moderator of what constitutes appropriate content.Tom"
"The people that follow this site are for the most part, big fans of Huatulco and feel a special attachment to the place and it’s people.. Getting an update on how Huatulco is weathering the pandemic seems like an appropriate use of the Huatulco forum of TA. I for one, do not find CH posts to be snobbish and his wealth or lack of it, has no bearing on the content of his posts. I am sure we could find the information he posts in other locations, but it is a whole lot simpler to be able to find it here. Keep posting Cash Hoffa!"
"CH has his opinions on matters as do many other posters. However, I find his posts to be very informative. If you don't like them, don't read them!"
"Mike, I could not disagree more strongly. CasaHoffas posts are entirely different that those of PatY and his/her aliases because Casa Hoffa is an actual person who spends the majority of his time living in Huatulco. Pat Y, on the other had, may or may not be an actual person who has maybe visited Huatulco,. Regardless, he/she finds a great deal of pleasure in making derogatory statements about local businesses, the local and Federal Mexican government and all those who disagree with her. To say that Casa Hoffa's posts are no different that Pat Y's does a great disservice to Casa Hoffa and glorifies the rubbish that Pat Y continues to spread. Sorry Mike Jr, but I think you got this one dead wrong."
How about you both agree to disagree and we move on from this?
"I am truly sorry Mike that the Jr was inadvertently included, it was not intended nor implied. Just one more thing, how could Casa Hoffa’s post be described as not first hand? The man lives in Huatulco, which is about as first hand as one can get when commenting about events taking place there."
"If TripAdvisor was running at full strength,their would be no Pat Y, or Pat Why ? As I think of her,him . Casa Hoffa is a valuable contributor to this site,in my opinion"
"As is Mike and everyone else, but Pat Why ? is just an instigator"
"We want to thank those if you who have posted kind statements of support. We appreciate your candor. For those who feel chagrined by what we write, we can only say that in these times of COVID-19 the news is full of angry folks pointing fingers. That is your choice.We will continue to provide at least daily updates on the situation here in Huatulco. The government usually updates the infection data in the evening.Yesterday, we went shopping for essentials at the local butchers, cheese purveyors and produce markets. Everyone was masked and practicing social distancing. One fellow noticed that we had dropped an item and chased us down to give it to us. We spoke with all of the shopkeepers about their health and that of their families’ health. We have known some of these people for over 10 years and have shared many stories. Happily there were no reports of COVID-19 symptoms and that seems to fit with the case load in Huatulco: 5 confirmed and no increase for almost 2 weeks!Be well, stay safe.CH"
"In times when people feel they have no control over their lives, they are prone to lash out, and look for someone to blame. If nothing more, your posts have provided a little insight into the daily happenings of the area that so many of us love and are proud to call our second home. Please, do not let the naysayers and doubters deter you from continuing to share your observations and comments. In time, we can all return to arguing about which restaurant serves the best margaritas, or which beach has the softest sand or gentlest surf. Those will be better times for all of us."
"Times like this bring out the best,in the best people,and the worst in the worst people."
"Seems in the US, the latter are making it a lot harder for the former"
"Fear and uncertainty know no boundaries Dave. I live in a rural area in Southern Ontario where many of the local folks are scared beyond believe. Some have taken to posting license plates of out of Province cars on local social media sites. Fortunately the actual data of positive cases, hospitalizations, and deaths remains very, very low considering our proximity to both Toronto and Montreal where the numbers are much, much higher. It is amazing how fear can cloud people’s judgement and loose their ability to reason."

"CasaHoffa, I am alittle confused with the numbers you’re reporting. The active case number seems to be staying fairly constant. Am I correct in assuming that the confirmed and suspected cases are cumulative, since they started keeping track? If the active case number is 5, does that mean that all the confirmed and suspected cases are now resolved, with the exception of course of the tragic fatalities? Please do not misinterpret my question, I am by no means trying to minimize this tragedy, just trying to grasp the direction and intensity of the spread of the virus. Also, do you have any information regarding the rate of hospitalization?"
Well Canada has flights from Dallas & SF and this is happening - shut down these flights!!: https://bc.ctvnews.ca/covid-19-cases-identif…
"Hi John. The numbers we report are provided by the Mexican government. There are definitions provided at the same website (a link provided below).

Thanks for the updates. I was afraid of this. Huatulco opened up too early with the majority of tourists coming from cities in Mexico where COVID-19 is a big problem. There is not enough screening being done and no quarantine required. This may place the entire 2020/2021 winter tourism season in jeopardy. I hope things do not get too bad there.
"Well, the entire state of Oaxaca will be returning to RED effective July 20. Hopefully that will keep inconsiderate tourists away (both nationals and international visitors), who are more concerned about a beach vacation than protective themselves and their hosts in the state. Alvin Starkman - Mezcal Educational excursions of Oaxaca"
"I understand your outrage Alvin ,I don’t understand why anyone is surprised that the virus has made its way to Huatulco,blame who you want,but you’ve been surrounded by the virus for months,seclusion doesn’t last in the modern world, protect yourself,mask ,distance,hands, the world is not stopping for any of us ,at this point,or any point"
"Unfortunately, Dave, Huatulco is adding confirmed cases almost daily even with the sparsity of testing. As Alvin indicates, if things keep regressing in the state of Oaxaca, visitors will likely find themselves in a 14-day quarantine upon arrival.CH"
"Been reading many sections of the Mexico travel information forums. For any success, all international travel must include a 14 day self isolate quarantine, both arrival and return. The only alternative is a immunization vaccine.Direct international flights landing in Huatulco airport simply for vacationers would be nothing less than disastrous. Do non residents of Mexico still actually believe that they will be flying direct to Huatulco to vacation?Edited: 12:39 pm, July 18, 2020 "
"The day the 1st bus arrived the outcome was obviously going to become the current situation. I was hoping to come down but obviously not happening. Very sad and disheartening, the health of the people and economic well being of the area is in great peril, help if you can."
"Several months ago we purchased a property near Huatulco. All that’s left is the closing, yet despite delaying it for months it looks like it’s still going to be precarious to complete the transaction. We are scheduled for a short trip to the area at the end of July. We will assure we are COVID-free before traveling, wear masks the entire time, social distance and only stay for a couple of days. Does anyone know if the new designation of “RED” in Oaxaca means mandatory 14 day quarantine when we arrive? If so, it’s obviously a deal breaker and we will continue to wait it out. If not, we are hoping to safely complete the transaction then come back in 2021 or whenever things are safe again. Input is appreciated :)"
"we closed on our place without being there a couple of years ago, had to give power of attorney to someone and hire a notary,who in Mexico acts as your attorney."
"Interesting FIRST POSTS. Good luck to both of you GK and Rick. And by the way Rick, can you provide ANY information on a vaccine for ANY type of CORONA virus?CH"
"As you know CH, a vaccine for COVID-19 is an ""if"" not ""when"". There are some promising candidates but nothing for sure on the horizon. International travel will be greatly facilitated and safer when rapid and accurate tests for COVID-19 are available to detect infection and control outbreaks. The asymptomatic transmission is a real challenge with this virus. Too many people behave as they did before the pandemic just because they feel fine. This is the main factor causing the increasing numbers. As many people have posted, please provide financial support to the people of Huatulco if you can. Donations to the food bank is the easiest route but there are many other opportunities as well."
"Casa Hoffa, not sure how to answer your question.It may take a number of years to have an absolute complete positive success with a vaccination plan for this infectious global catastrophe. I was hoping as many others I assume, warm weather would slow the spread. But most southern US states are in crisis.Mezcal Tours input appears to be the best direction.Not keen gambling vacation and economics in Huatulco with life and death. Hence my question about international travel to Huatulco. Who will put their cards o the table, and travel?"
For the answer to your question go check out the Trip Advisor forums for Cancun and the Riviera Maya. Hard to believe that people are being allowed to travel to Mexico when they are coming from areas where COVID-19 is out of control.
"You aren't talking about the recent flight from Mexico City to Vancouver that had a person on it with COVID-19 of course. I am still struggling with how Canada is allowing flights this (and many, many more) with the required 14-day quarantine being more of an honour system than anything."
"There is an article on Reuters today that says that 187,000 people from the US entered Canada last week. Those are just the documented ones. Yup, sounds like a closed border to me."
"A quick re-read of the Reuters article indicates the number of 187,000 also includes truck drivers who are deemed an essential service. While there are a certain number of unauthorized entries, generally speaking, the numbers of US citizens entering into Canada are down substantially from an average of 1,000,000 per month pre-Covid. Yes, even one person who enters the country and is infected is a cause for concern, however to describe the situation as out of control seems a bit of a stretch to me."
I never said the number of people entering from the US was out of control. It sounds like a high number to me during a pandemic and when the borders are supposed to be closed.
"The fact that they chose to include truck drivers in their numbers is strange as drivers are required to ensure we maintain our food and material supply chains. There are hundreds, if not thousands of Canadian and American men and women who risk their health and the health of their families every day crossing the border so that we can have food and other goods readily available. To somehow lump them in with a small number of scofflaws does them a great injustice in my opinion.Edited: 7:53 pm, July 19, 2020 "

"Rick J, we have our condo & airfare re-booked for March 2021. We had to re-book by July or lose credits. Just a wait and see game now. I have all this money out from the trip that didn’t happen this past March. I guess if we can’t go in 2021, I have no clue what I’ll do then."
"We are booked for the first two weeks in November. We did these bookings before COVID-19. We are in wait-and-see mode right now but the recent events in the US may mean that 14-day quarantine in Canada stays in effect for a long time. However, that won't be known until September or so."
"At this point in time, my credit for our cancelled trip last March expires at the end of next March. Westjet has not indicated that they will extend the credit and I am getting increasingly more doubtful that I will be able to get travel insurance, a vaccination or not have to quarantine. Not looking good:("

"The Covid topic at home is a daily issue. Can’t see our family in Mexico dealing with the same thing. The adventure will be spoiled with the same issue.

"Sadly, this evening a 45th confirmed COVID-19 case has been recorded in Huatulco. For more information, see:https://coronavirus.gob.mx/datos/Stay safe. Be well.CH"
you have 45 cases? It says you have 4 active.
"I would assume the 45 cases are the total recorded, positive cases to date, since the start of the pandemic. If there are 4 active cases, the other 41 are either resolved, or some have tragically succumbed to the virus."
"We would say that “assumption” is incorrect as there is a sparsity of testing throughout Mexico and especially in Huatulco. We suggest using an appropriate multiple.CHEdited: 5:15 pm, July 21, 2020 "
"Absolutely. Unfortunately, we don't know what we don't know. The number of active cases could, and most probably is, much higher than 4. Without widespread, thorough testing, and more accurate reporting, the exact extent of the virus will never be known, regardless of which country you are looking at. Certainly a troubling sign is the daily increase in new positive cases. A declining number would be so much more promising. Hopefully the rate of hospitalization is low as overwhelmed hospitals can be catastrophic for any region, especially where resources are already stretched or non existent. All of our prayers and best wishes go out to all of our friends and acquaintances in Huatulco. Take care of yourselves CasaHoffa and thank you for your updates."
"As there is a sparsity of testing throughout Mexico and especially in Huatulco, we suggest using an appropriate multiple. Even, in the USA with much testing, some experts say a multiple of 20 is not unreasonable....probably a much higher multiple in Mexico. CHEdited: 3:38 pm, July 24, 2020 "
"In 2020, the number of consultations in Mexico for diseases related to pneumonia and influenza is fifty times higher than the average of previous years.

"Watched a BBC report on COVID where the Brits were crying the blues about having to quarantine for 2 weeks when returning from Spain. These are two of the hardest hit countries in the whole world -- worse than the US even. Unbelievable that they would have even opened up travel in the first place. In any case the report had a travel ""expert"" from LA talking about the whole issue and the effect it is having on travel. She said that the ""upside"" was that the US was allowing free travel to Mexico and that Cancun in particular was being very cooperative. Apparently the US and Mexico are just as naive as the UK and Spain. The US is bad and the trajectory that Mexico is on, indicates they will surpass the US in the next month. Mexico blew by Canada a month ago, and has one of the steepest trajectories in the world.https://tinyurl.com/y5mq5pdgMy view remains unchanged. No travel until there is a vaccine and I have had it. This winter seems out of the question, but next winter is a possibility. Unlike the UK and US our PM has not bought into any vaccine production."

Is all this increase due to tourists starting to arrive? I'm really surprised by how many tourists are planning to go to Mexico this fall and early winter. This from many forums I visit on TA. I'm also surprised that Mexico is letting flights from the U.S. arrive at all. Both countries are doing so poorly controlling this thing.

"FYI, if you have symptoms, today and tomorrow there will be free testing for COVID-19 in Huatulco. Call for an appointment at (958) 581-4350.CH"
"Unfortunately, with increased testing comes additional COVID-19 cases. This evening the following has been reported: 104 confirmed cases plus an additional 27 suspected cases, 7 deaths and 10 active cases. Our prayers are with all of those affected. For more information, see:https://coronavirus.gob.mx/datos/Stay safe. Be well.CH"
"Stay home! The state of Oaxaca just announced we are downgraded to yellow from orange, in the face of Huatulco reporting 8 new cases between Thursday and yesterday. I don't like being political, and I'm not even American, but it's as if we are taking our lead from President Trump, wanting to open up the economy at the expense of the health of residents. I don't recall any single 24 hour period when the number of Huatulco cases has jumped like most recently. The state capital registered 23 new cases, and in the face of this bars and cantinas can now open with certain protocols, nothing as comprehensive as some American eateries and bars are following. Surely you can defer your vacation for your own health, and for that of the locals who you may infect if you arrive as an asymptomatic carrier.

"A send out of loving thank you to Casa Hoffa and Alvin Starkman for the most important needed caring information during this time in history. Thank you.  The absolute opposite side of the spectrum, with growing disgust, Bayside Real Estate Own Mexico, rapaciously continue attempts for monetary gain. Peddling vacuous flight routes, suggesting COVID-19 insurance carriers, seemingly an effort to annul any travel health concerns Blatant grease the palm manipulation within our fine humble community. Its all loud and clear on social media. Shame."
"COVID is far from over. While many countries have leveled out in the rate of deaths, some are still increasing sharply. Peru is an example and now has the highest death rate in the world. And while places like Brazil, the US, and Mexico are lower, the rate is still increasing sharply. I would not consider travel to any of them. Brazil has blown by the US in death rate. Mexico has nearly caught up to the US, and will likely pass the US in death rate in the next couple of weeks. See this link:https://tinyurl.com/y3k4d9bk"
Stephanie/Pat/Alex etc. is using COVID-19 to continue with his/her tirade agains Bayside? How pathetic. You should be ashamed of yourself. Please stop posting. I have used Bayside a couple of times and would highly recommend them to anyone. They provided outstanding service.
That is unfortunate to hear.
"Oops! There’s another one! The trolls are multiplying again! How pitiful that Trip Advisor allows this. It diminishes the value of an otherwise informative site when such foolishness is left unchecked. There is no sense or value in addressing the posters, they are beyond reason and post only to provoke and antagonize the other members of this forum. I salute the owners of Bayside Realty for taking the high road, and ignoring the nonsense the spews from these entities."
"And the confirmed COVID-19 cases in Huatulco keep rising. Sadly, this evening the Municipal Council reported: 109 confirmed cases plus an additional 26 suspected cases, 9 deaths and 13 active cases. Our thoughts are with those who are affected. For more information, see:https://coronavirus.gob.mx/datos/Stay safe. Be well.CH"
