Travel with the virus is probably not a good idea.
"Yeah,the title is odd English, I guess.Check https://www.japantimes.co.jp/"
"Although only 34 persons have been identified as infected until today in Japan, no one can say that it's completely safe. Probably, more infected persons are unidentified yet and will be identified in February. But, I still hope effective treatments will be soon developed against this virus."
"34 cases in Japan among 125,000,000 population are extremely low. Current WHO global cases are 20,600 with 159 outside of China so less than 1% and is spreading very slowly only 7 more confirmed cases around the world since previous day.https:/…novel-coronavirusKeep up to date with information before travel date and understand precautions."
And less than 12 hours later the numbers are 24554 cases with 191 outside of China. Other sources have the total numbers a few thousand higher. Point is that in less than 12 hours the numbers can jump rather drastically. Would not say its spreading very slowly.
