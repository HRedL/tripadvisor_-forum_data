"Keen to start a rational conversation with people who have trips planned and are still intending on going.While I think the current situation deserves some healthy conversation, I personally believe it is human nature to be drawn towards drama. (No disrespect intended towards people who have legitimately been impacted)Our trip is from the 11th ->26th April and unless the Australian government issues some sort of travel ban, we are still super pumped for our trip."
You’re not coming until April... many people on here are coming within the next few days to an uncertain fate one week after the corona cruise passengers were foolishly released into society. They’re the ones gambling on it or canceling now. You’ll have a clearer picture by the time your departure date arrives in a few weeks. :)
"Our tickets are booked for 4-13 April, flying from SA via Hong Kong. At this point we haven't made any changes but as the virus seems to be spreading I am getting more concerned."
"Glad someone made this thread. We're flying out on the 19th of March for two weeks and cancelling hasn't crossed our mind. If anything, we're excited to experience the cherry blossom with fewer tourists than usual!The chances of running into someone with the virus (as it stands right now) is incredibly slim, and even then we're both in our 20s and healthy.Obviously we're monitoring things fairly closely, but short of our flights being cancelled we're still on track to go!"
"Nestra, safe travels. I’ve been doing the tourist places this week with a friend who is visiting from Denmark and most places have been quiet. Until today the has been like spring too. Hopefully it’ll be fine here during your trip. I think it’s 27-days (now) to stay away from the new baby just in case. :) No?"
"Thank you kobekeith!I hadn’t heard the 27 day recommendation - I think UK is still suggesting 14? However we live on opposite sides of the country to each other anyway, and so with seeing her this weekend, I’ll most likely to wait until Easter weekend to visit again anyway - which is conveniently 28 days from my return! :)"
You’re welcome! Better to be safe/cautious I guess. :)
"If you cannot get face masks, you can use your scarf instead. The number in Italy is increasing quite fast now. Take care!!"
"My partner and I will be flying out on 21 March, with a transit in Seoul. We are very excited and do not intend to cancel at all. Though admittedly I am very fortunate that I will receive full pay if I needed to stay at home after the holiday or I could consider working remotely. I hope everyone else deciding to travel has a great time!"
"My partner and I have flights on March 23rd, returning on April 4th. Up until this week, I had no doubts that our holiday was going ahead but now I'm a bit worried. If everything stays the same we will get on that flight as planned but we will wait until about a week before departure to decide. Obviously the financial loss would be huge, as we have already paid for our Airbnbs as well and my travel insurance won't pay unless the UK government issues a travel ban. Guess we will just have to go then :) We're both in our twenties and healthy and have the opportunity to work from home should we need to self-isolate so fingers crossed everything can go ahead as planned. I hope the next weeks will show some positive developments! Trying to stay optimistic for now."
Me too! And I can't wait!
"I leave on April 2nd and while I am keeping a close eye on the situation, cancelling the trip was never on the table. I would just be careful and I am also taking cleaning stuff for the airplane and hotels( I also never do ). I will have masks mainly for the airplane and like travel at any other time, will avoid rush hour trains. No pre- existing conditions with anyone, I am in my mid-fifties and generally in good shape. I will be taking large doses of Vit C( emergency packets); as a precaution. To all travelling, safe and happy travels."
"Glad you're still going, Trini BNot really any of my business and I'm not a doctor but I don't think there's any evidence that vitamin C supplements help with colds/flu or the coronavirus"
"Cherry Blossom will bloom earlier this year than usual, as its latest Forecast forecasts the full bloom days of standard blossom to be from March 24 to April 1 in Tokyo and from March 26 to April 3 in Kyoto. Therefore, April 11 is too late to see Standard Blossom in Tokyo and I suggests you to read this. https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3050_late.htmlAmong those places, I recommend you to visit Shinjuku Gyoen National Park in Tokyo and to day trip Kawaguchiko (Fuji 5 Lakes area) where you can enjoy Mt. Fuji with Cherry Blossom in mid April, as follows.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2bAy40RtHYhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x4Zxz4eQMkWhen you move to Kansai Region, you should visit Japan Mint Bureau in Osaka where you can see the Latest Cherry Blossom in Kansai, as follows.https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4008.htmlhttps://www.tripadvisor.jp/ShowUserReviews-g…Please check when it will be open this year from the following site.https:/…toorinuke-eng"
"Thank you for starting this thread! My husband, 11 year old daughter and I are leaving on March 22 and returning April 4. This is our first visit and we will be in Tokyo, Kyoto and a day trip to Nara. My daughter is studying Japanese in school and is excited to practice speaking and reading in Japan. We are excited! No plans to cancel unless the US raises the travel alert. If course we are watching carefully, and packing our masks and sanitizer (which I always use anyway)."
"Christina, Airbnb has a coronavirus policy up stating they will refund all money if you need to cancel in an area where infection has been reported"
"Hello everyone!Glad someone made this thread! So far, i'm not canceling anything and this trip is ALL me and the wife can think about! We're from Miami and have been planning this trip for almost a year. We arrive in Narita on the 14th of March and leave on the 24th. Hopefully these next two weeks are enough for the Japanese govt to put a hold on the spread (so far, it looks like they're doing a pretty good job compared to the countries with the community spread reported on the news). I'm super excited for the less crowded tourist spots in Kyoto in particular. My only concern is the street food markets! Hopefully they're open when we're there. We did get ticket for Bordeless and some other spots and so far none has cancelled it.Here's is to hoping that ALL of us in this thread have a fun and safe trip."
"I didn't know this! Thought the cancellation policy depended entirely on the host. Amazing news, thanks for sharing :)"
Has anyone heard about flipkey? I booked our Rental through TripAdvisor flip key.
"I am still planning on traveling across Japan for 5 weeks in all the major areas (Kyoto Area, Niigatta, Kyushu, Shigoku , Hokkaido ,Sendai, and Tokyo surrounding area) from April 06 -May 11,2020 from Canada. The Japanese people are very good about cleanliness probably more so then most places in the world.But even with that said, is anyone aware of any attractions that have been closed due to the crisissuch as Castles, Onsens, Kabuki, Sumo Events or any other events besides sports?As I read about some breweries in Hokkaido have been closed to prevent possible spread after the cases found within a school."
"Our trip starts march 9th until march 21...going back and forth with questions ..,,but since our country ( and others) still give a positive traveladvice we are planning on going. we have a direct flight to Osaka and leaving via Narita.hopefully all will go well, and it will be a wonderful vacation.( it will be my second time to this beautiful country)Edited: 11:33 am, February 26, 2020 "
"Studies indicate vitamin C can help but not a complete panacea to colds. The infection cases have doubled from about 80 to 180 in the last week so it’s still not spreading exponentially and in large numbers at present to warrant panic as yet so the odds of not being infected are still extremely low. Some posters are saying the infection numbers should be considered locally, so let’s say Tokyo and other places with 10-30 million population locally and 25-35 cases is still very sparse and the likelihood of coming across infected persons is negligible at present. Also, reference to unusual and strange infection cases in media articles is not a confirmed representation of what is going on at large as yet.Other country government advisories have not as yet issued warnings against visiting Japan, unlike others China and some Korean cities with recent higher case infections. The infection case numbers do matter per head of country population and guide decision making in this regard but needs to be constantly reassessed closer to your travel date.Edited: 11:37 am, February 26, 2020 "
"My 12-year-old son and I (mid 40s) have a trip planned from 19th of March until 3rd of April to Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto, with possible side trips to Kamakura, Disney, Nara, and Hiroshima. As of today, our trip is still a go, though I am keeping an eye on the situation. We're generally healthy and are avid hand-washers, and in the absence of soap and water, I usually have wipes and sanitizers on hand. I managed to snag some masks before they started selling out, and I'm even bringing disposable gloves (we are big nerds and gamers so arcades will be a must for us - and ah, germy buttons!)While I don't have any worries about missing work in the event of a quarantine, my son is another issue as he is still in school. If this was any other vacation I probably would have canceled already, but Japan is his dream so I am waiting until the very last minute in the event I have to cancel."
"My husband and I are still planning to come March 16-26 from the US! We are low risk, but my mom has COPD and she's watching out kids when we are gone, so our plan is to just do a quick roadside hand off of the kids when we get back just to be safe and stay away from her for a couple weeks upon our return. Ditto to others that we are looking forward to less crowds. I'm actually following the CDC, but also the Canadian travel advisories because they are much different than the U.S."
"I'm slated to come to Tokyo April 26 - May 4. So far I'm not cancelling, will just monitor the travel advisories, etc. I'm gonna bring hand sanitizer/wipes and will just exercise regular precautions.Frankly I'm more concerned about being quarantined than catching a virus. I'll just monitor wait and see."
"My family (2 adults early 40's, 2 teenage kids) is still planning to take our early July trip. I have no concerns about getting the virus, but we'll take some extra precautions like bringing along some wipes and such and being more diligent about hand washing. By the time we go it'll either be a widespread pandemic or have died down so I'm not too concerned. My biggest area of concern is that our flights from Canada are transiting through LAX so I'm beholden to whatever the US decides to do about air travel to/from Japan."
Leaving on the 22nd March via Frankfurt solo. I'm still hopeful of being able to go. I'm lucky I don't have regular contact with people that may be high risk and can work from home if I need to self quarantine. Trying not to get too scared off and practicing not touching my face so much and making sure I get into the habit of correctly washing my hands. My travel insurance also won't cover unless WHO announce it's pandemic.
"Our trip isn’t until 9th May, and we certainly didn’t even think of not going. I’m guessing the virus will disappear until then anyway.What is really scary though is the speculation about the Olympics being cancelled that the BBC was choking on today, despite the event being 5 months away and nobody saying anything about cancelling it - at least not just yet. The media drama and scaremongering is what is a huge problem, probably bigger than the coronavirus itself. Again, I’m not downplaying the risk for those more prone to severe outcomes, but everyone else needs to go back to basics of hygiene and sanity, and think about the last time they had a proper flu."
"We’ve been here for 5 days so far and everything seems fine although apparently less crowded than usual. We can’t avoid public transport which is busy and the Tokyo metro was like the London Underground. So glad we came now. We hope that we aren’t quarantined on the way home but if so, we’ll have had a great holiday. Think we will probably self quarantine at home for 14 days just to be sure and avoid relatives, grandkids friends etc"
"Our trip is April 6th to 23rd and we can't wait to go, so excited. Being cautious but sensible and logical. I won't mind at all if the tourist places, trains, theme parks are much quieter than usual, lol."
"We have plans to travel on April 2 - April 20. I feel like there's a 50-50% chance we're going. I haven't cancelled anything but let's say our ""government"" raises the travel advisory from Level 2 to Level 3, we would definitely cancel the trip. My son who lives in Osaka said about 75% of the people on the street are wearing masks."
"That's a good thing, people are taking precautions. The Japanese people have been wearing masks for years, that's not necessarily a Coronavirus thing. And to put it into perspective, the number of Coronavirus cases in Osaka currently? One. Population of Osaka? 19,223,000."
Yikes. I’m pretty sure that’s about 11 million people too many for OSAKA’s population. :)
Is it Kobe? I got it from this site - https:/…population
"I am currently still going on my trip planned for April 6th - Apr 23rd. I am monitoring the situation as I am flying through Seoul ICN airport, but so far the cases there are mainly towards the south of South Korea I am not as worried yet.Hopefully things will get better over there within a month of time!"
"I just asked the Japanese teachers sitting next to me and they laughed. They’re sticking with 8 million. LolI thought it was 6. :)Either way, it’s crowded and “only 1” corona case on paper so that’s good.Edited: 6:09 pm, February 26, 2020 "
That link for “other cities” in Japan doesn’t have Kōbe City or Kyōto City so maybe it’s lumping a bunch of cities together?! Odd if that’s the case. I certainly do not live in Osaka and don’t work in Osaka. I happily pass thru Osaka Station every day on my way to/from work but that’s as close as I usually get.
">>And to put it into perspective, the number of Coronavirus cases in Osaka currently? One.<<That's because the authorities don't test people. If you don't test, the number doesn't go up.One of my sisters who's in Osaka area has had a fever and cough for 4 days now and she's been to 5 different clinics/hospitals and they all denied testing her. One of them told her that there are probably 2,500 people waiting for a test ahead of her. So yea no test no increase."
"Dr S. #39 - Okay, that makes me worry."
"Dr. Shibuyakko,Why are they not testing people if there are symptoms that may be something more serious? 2,500 people waiting ahead of her is a lot of people... and what are those people supposedly doing.. still wandering about?"
"There are sick people all around me. But hey, they’ve got masks on for part of the day when they’re not pulled down to their chins. It’s final exam week here so they’re saying that they can’t stay home based on the “maybe” or “what if” they have corona so they’re gambling on not having it. “Probably” Because clinics aren’t testing people.Edited: 7:35 pm, February 26, 2020 "
">>Why are they not testing people if there are symptoms that may be something more serious? <<Because if you test people, the number of COVID-19 positive cases will go up which Japanese government really wants to avoid. They can't have the Olympics cancelled, you know? They'll lose billions of yen. Just spoke to a classmate of mine who is now a big shot at Juntendo Uni Hospital (think John Hopkins in the US) and he said that the Ministry of Health has criteria for eligibility for the test.Eligible to take the virus test are people who have come into close contact with coronavirus patients or have recently traveled to infected areas in China, and have a fever of at least 37.5 C as well as pneumonia-like symptoms that require hospitalization. Unbelievable, isn't it? He also said that the final decision is doctors' but there are no test kits at hand. He'll have to order it and wait for a few days! >>and what are those people supposedly doing.. still wandering about?<<Just that including sardine packed trains, theaters etc etc."
"DR. S,I find it absurd they won’t test people with possible symptoms unless they been in close contact with someone with COVID-19. How will one know if the person they stand or sit next to isn’t carrying it..... I find it kind of saddening...."
">>How will one know if the person they stand or sit next to isn’t carrying it<<You'll never know. My classmate also said that the majority of COVID-19 patients get better without much medical interventions. So many people might think they have a cold and get over it. That's good but at the same time, they can infect many people and elderly and chronically ill can get really sick or worse. We'll just have to see how everything turns out."
"I’m finding it not so shocking at this point. Unfortunately. Didn’t someone on here make an erroneous claim that they’d been in direct contact with 3 corona virus carriers in the Osaka area recently?!?!? Or was that another deflection from the truths?Edited: 8:34 pm, February 26, 2020 "
"kobekeith, Dr Shibuyakko,Thank you for revealing more truth in Japan on this forum, and I feel so sorry for your sister in Osaka. It looks like the Japanese Government is simply taking an approach by burying its head in the sand. But it won't take long before an outbreak which might be more severe than in China or South Korea if the infected are not identified, contained and treated timely.I wonder how/why local doctors, NGOs like Red Cross, media are not raising alarms. Shouldn't the lives of local people be of utmost importance than Olympics or other political agenda ?Edited: 8:43 pm, February 26, 2020 "
thank you for starting this my anxiety for this trip has been going through the roof i fly out on the 4th march and come back on the 19th so unless my tour gets cancelled im going. i think i have been panicking mostly because other people have been panicking for me so its nice to see other people still going.
I'm going in mid May. I'm going to assume it'll run its course and settle down once warmer weather hits. Sure it is on my mind but I'm more concerned about getting quarintined back in USA or an earthquake striking.
"Good to see lots of people still planning on going! We're travelling out of Toronto on April 3rd to the 17th. We purchased the appropriate Travel Cancellation and Health Insurance for this trip. We're keeping a close eye on developments, but unless the travel advisory is a L3 or L4, we're still a go! Bringing masks, surface wipes and hand sanitizer for sure."
">>>Thank you for revealing more truth in Japan on this forum, and I feel so sorry for your sister in Osaka.<<<Thank you. She's feeling much better today so hopefully she'll recover without any complications from whatever she has. Japanese Medical Association is now looking into the lack of PCR test. Also a new test that takes only 30 minutes will be available come March, according to my classmate. JMA also has designated March as the month to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infections and recommended cancellations of many events and closure of attractions. They also recommended closure of all public elementary and middle schools until the spring break, which means all schools are closed until the second week of April.If anybody is planning on coming in March, just know that many tourist attractions are closed and many events cancelled. Here is a list and it'll get longer:https://www.japan-guide.com/news/alerts.html"
We leave for Japan on 21st March from the UK for our honeymoon and as of yet have no plans to cancel unless forced to cancel due to FOC advice changing etc (both in our early 30s with no health concerns) We booked everything ‘DIY’ so wouldn’t get anything back unless the travel insurance can pay out!We are flying via Taiwan and slightly concerned that our airline (China Airlines) seems to be cancelling a lot of flights but just keeping fingers crossed that ours isn’t cancelled and that the situation improves in the next few weeks. Glad to see other people still planning on going!
I am in a group of 4 leaving from Texas direct flight to Tokyo March 19th and we currently have no plans of cancelling unless American cancels our flights/ the US creates a travel ban. Looking forward to it!!
"Good to see some are still waiting it out for now ... I'm monitoring closely. I'm in Tokyo exclusively so that does concern me slightly, but I'm more worried about forced quarantine upon US return, TBH. I'm just hanging onto my Airbnb and flight for now until as late as possible to make decision. I'll be there Golden Week, so if it's true that Tokyo tends to empty a bit then, that might help with less ppl on trains, etc. Good luck to everyone here, fingers crossed! Japan seems to have woken up a bit and looks like is making March the month to stop or slow this bug."
Schools across Japan are not actually “closing” it seems. It looks like the government is taking a strong stance in the media I guess. It’s not true though. :(
"I have vacation approved for 9 days, the very end of March to early April. (March30-to-April9) but I read it might be too late for cherry blossoms at that time. I hope I will still be able to see it. I haven’t booked anything yet. I haven’t booked flight tickets or bought my jr pass. Going to japan for cherry blossoms and eating Japanese food, sushi train, ramen, curry rice etc etc, I’m so looking forward to it. but I definitely take corona virus very seriously and see how it goes in the next few weeksEdited: 9:15 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"Don't book to go travel anywhere now if you can, it's so unpredictable with how things are going. People who booked way before coronavirus was known like me have no choice but to monitor the situation and decide to cancel and lose money, or go with the risk of getting quarantine after return or worse quarantine in Japan. Chance to contract virus in Japan may be low, but it's not exactly zero either. I'm quite concerned about Japan having so little cases right now compared to S.Korea and Italy. Is that even possible for Italy to have more cases than Japan??? Clearly no one really believe Japan only has that many cases (some countries already banning entry or quarantine people returning from Japan, CDC & DFAT (Australia) level 2 warning). I would rather Japan tests people and have many cases right now like S.Korea, it means the government is monitoring the situation. It's bad that the Japanese government is giving out this false sense of security of Japan having low cases and pretend like there's no big outbreak in the big cities like Osaka and Tokyo."
"Some cities like Nagoya are short of the test kits, just like California right now. The local governments are not allowing the doctors to check all that need to be tested.In South Korea, it spread at churches of new religion, but they are testing quite efficiently.Edited: 10:23 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"Eddenia, it’s true and sad that the numbers are being hidden or not even counted at all in order to give a false sense of security. Coverups are the norm."
"I have a trip March 27 - April 5, originally to Osaka - Kyoto and Tokyo but planning to skip Tokyo entirely and take a flight from KIX to Narita Airport which is also cheaper than a one-way Shinkansen ticket from Kyoto to Tokyo. For now, still planning on going mostly because our plane tickets aren't refundable but only rebookable. Unless our government bans it. I'm from the Philippines and I think Japan will be included in our travel ban soon. A new travel advisory will be released later today or tomorrow which I am anxiously waiting. I am a healthy person in my 20s so I am not that scared of getting the virus but I don't want to be quarantined upon return in the PH. Can't even imagine me being asymptomatic and passing the virus to my almost senior mother! So for now, it's a 60-40 odds of going. Willing to wait it out til the first half of March."
"Apart from the apparent lack of testing in Japan, the same criteria applies in many other countries around the world where patients cannot simply ask for a test without adequate likely case infection history, symptoms and priority. The health system in most countries will be overloaded and the ones who have highest priority and likelihood of actually being infected with coved-19 will miss out, that is until they stock up on supplies and staffing.Edited: 11:45 pm, February 27, 2020 "
Looks like Disney will be closing for a couple of weeks now? We are Annual Pass holders here in California so Tokyo Disney was definitely on the list (especially DisneySea) ... but still not quite enough to be a deal breaker just yet.Wonder if my stubbornness is going to end up causing us trouble?
People coming might want to bring toilet paper now too. If you’re renting an apartment from Airbnb. Hotels will probably have enough supplies even though locals can’t get it.
"I was supposed to be traveling early March but changed the dates to the end of May/early June. Really hoping the situation has calmed by then, but if not I’ll leave it until the last second to cancel."
"I can confirm a shortage of face masks at pharmacies here in Tokyo, based on my experience today.Didn't think to check on toilet paper (but we've kept an emergency supply since the March 15 earthquake :-)Here's a cross-post from another current thread here on TAI live in Tokyo, and am here now. The way I'm summing it up for friends and family back home is to make some anecdotal observations:The number of tourists in Tokyo is downThe use of face masks is up (but this is already flu and allergy season)The drugstores I checked were sold out of face masksWord is, the face masks will stop the transmission of the virus, but it will not protect you from the virusThe best hygiene protocol is to wash your hands with soap and waterSecond best is rubbing alcohol as hand washThird is alcohol based hand sanitizerFourth is alcohol-based handi-wipesI can confirm that at lest some international schools have closed until after Spring Break, at. the end of MarchReliable numbers of cases in Japan are hard to come by, but in general are considered by most people I've talked to as suspiciously lowHokkaido has the most number of cases by prefectureI don't know how reliable this website is, but this website has numbers to attach to country names https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ (Japan is currently sixth, NOT including the cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.Japan-Guide, which is considered a reliable source by most long-time contributors here at TA and on other discussion boards, has a list of closures. not sure how often it's updated, but it's dated February 28th.I'm compiling a post which lists some of these resources and other info that I find interesting/important for locals and expats in, and travelers to, Japan and Tokyo in particular, at Tokyo Coronavirus: Is it Safe? https://medium.com/tokyo-kills-me/tokyo-coro…"
My partner and I are still going to! We leave 20th March from Gold Coast airport. I really hope the theme parks will be open! Temporary closure of universal studios atm :(
"Yup, Universal Studios in Osaka closes tomorrow, as does Tokyo Disney Resort. You can find a list of closures in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka at https://www.japan-guide.com/news/alerts.htmlI am compiling such interesting and useful resources as this on the post Tokyo Coronavirus: Is it Safe? at https://medium.com/tokyo-kills-me/tokyo-coro…"
"Are temples and temple grounds still open? I am super happy spending two weeks just mooching round shops, cafes, nature walks etc. with museums and attractions closing - but Kyoto without temples would be a real shame."
"Knight741, You are absolutely correct, Vit.C neither prevents nor cures and it certainly does nothing that I know off for Coronavirus; however, IMHO it helps me with a little boost especially since there is also Vit. B in the emergency packets. I am sorry if I came across as any kind of authority, I was just saying what I would do. ( Something like an old wives tale)"
"Just curious, for those who are still going, do you have the ability for a full refund? Would your response change if you have the ability for a full refund? We are still “going” bc we bought our airfare through a third party (lesson learned...never saw this coming)...our fare is partially refundable, but would still like to recover as much as we can. Otherwise, I would have definitely cancelled our trip about two days ago. Before that, I was still fairly optimistic because April seemed a ways away and looking forward to smaller crowds. Unless things get drastically better from now until then, and our departure date creeps up and nothing has been announced by ANA (that I can go to the third party with...good luck with that right?), I’ll take the loss and cancel...the exposure and the possibility of also being someone who brings it home is not worth it.Edited: 10:43 am, February 28, 2020 "
Hi! I’m scheduled to land in Japan March 20. My concern now that Japan has closed is its schoools is whether the tourist sites and temple will remain open. Can anyone advise if they remain open?Thank you and safe travels!
"honubaby, I bought directly from ANA but don't have the option for a full refund at the moment. If I cancel or rebook, I'll have to pay a $300 fee per ticket (plus difference in ticket prices if rebooking) - not a huge loss in the grand scheme of things. Would an option for a full refund change my mind? Maybe. The closings of attractions is weighing more than the possible monetary loss for me right now."
"@phoofy ... partial is better than nothing, I think we have another $100 tacked on to ours for going through vayama. But the closures are definitely a consideration...many attractions are closed, schools are closed, are stores and restaurants next? The pictures of the empty streets of Wuhan during the strict quarantine are still fresh on my mind. Let’s really hope it doesn’t get there! I don’t think the spread will be as prevalent as it was in China just because of Japan’s infrastructure and culture of cleanliness, but I do believe that the number of cases are severely underreported. I’d like to add that if it were just us adults going (work from home) I’d be more okay if we made the trip, but we need to send the kids back to school after our supposed spring break in Tokyo. Would our teachers/parents appreciate us returning to school right away regardless how careful we are? It is a very personal choice for everyone...with that said, sorry for veering off the I’m still going thread."
"Kobekeith - as our Kyoto expert on this forum, can you tel me if temples are still open? Or at least the gardens? And I wonder if restaurants etc are staying closed?"
"We're spending 2 weeks in Japan at the end of August/early September, and nothing is going to stop us!"
"Laura, schools in japan aren’t actually closed. That’s just a press release to make the government look like they’re doing something. I’m still going to school every day. Students are off from my school. Two of my friends’ schools are high schools in Kōbe and they are also working and they have exams next week and aren’t canceling them. My friend at a high school in Kyōto is also working and students are still going. ALL teachers are still going to work even if students are staying home. “They” are being a bit deceptive by the wording. If we truly had a major health risk, you’d think the older teachers would be told to stay home and the government would actually “close” the schools."
"Nestra, I was out for happy hour last night in Gion at a new cocktail bar in a little house and people were out. We then went to an izakaya for food and it was full. All of the places seemed to be running as usual. I’ve not heard of any temples or shrines closing yet. Or gardens. My friend from Denmark went around to my recommended places yesterday and said they were great and made no comment about anything being closed. It seems like the places that are closing are all doing it from this weekend so if the temples and shrines are copying the museums and amusement parks then it’ll be soon. I’ve not heard anything yet. It’s Saturday morning and I’m up for work again. Heading to Kōbe in the next hour from Kyōto. Will see more today."

"Temples/shrines/gardens are all open so are restaurants and shops. Trains/subways/buses are operating on the regular schedule. Temples/shrines are where people worship and pray, so they will be the last things to be closed in crises."
"For the people who came back from japan back to the USA recently, do they have to be quarantined after coming back? I work in a healthcare facility so my concern is that after coming back from japan, I might not be able to go back to work coz I went to japan"
"LostUndertheSky,I think that is something your job might ask you to do and you might want to consider doing since symptoms can be dormant... if you are worried you can't go back to work upon returning from Japan, maybe you can reconsider your trip. Just a suggestion.As I work with Pre-School students, even if US don't ask us to self-quarantine, I will do so just to prevent anything from happening in a worse case scenario."
Unfortunately OP will likely NOT be going now as United just basically halted trips there (made the announcement about an hour ago) and I expect Delta and American to follow suit. I am friends with quite a few flight attendants and they're all saying no one wants to work these flights once one airline cancels them so it starts getting tricky. I'm super bummed. I've been following this forum for about a week now as we were set to go 3/24-4/8 and even two hours ago I was being cautiously optimistic but there's no way now that anyone who has plans to go with a departure date in March is going to make it there from the US.
"MsPa... oh no! I’m supposed to go home in March after my trip to Europe. Leaving in 2 weeks! I haven’t seen this news yet! :(My last chance to sleep in “my” bedroom. July will be too late. Parents moving. And they’ll throw everything away that I “need” there.Edited: 5:25 pm, February 28, 2020 "
>> there's no way now that anyone who has plans to go with a departure date in March is going to make it there from the US.Fake news. Selected Japan routes suspended. Not affected (among others):Daily SFO - HND Daily EWR - NRT
"Schools in Kyōto , Osaka and Kōbe are not closed. It’s fake news to make the government look good. Even if schools are “closed” they truly are NOT closed. ALL teachers still commute to school as usual and must sit there all day doing nothing. Well, they nap a lot and play games on their phones and nap again and then eat snacks and then nap again and then commute as usual potentially exposing themselves to the virus that’s allegedly spreading. So the government doesn’t care if teachers contract the virus and then pass it to the students in a month from now. That’s OK. At least they got their headlines around the world."
"Update on paper supply in Tokyo: The full shelves of toilet paper at Family Mart as of 9:30am this morning are now, two hours later, completely sold out. The entire ""paper"" section of the Big Box drugstore near my house is also bare: except for a sign asking people to limit purchases of tissue and toilet paper to one set, per family I believe it is...So, some supplies are getting through (such as the paper at the FM this morning, but just as quickly being bought up b y people who, I suspect, are not in the ""one-per-family"" spirit..."
"I guess the “ fake news” toilet paper story being fake is fake.Edited: 10:17 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"Kōbe , Sannomiya stores don’t have toilet paper either."
"I have been so so certain of going this Sunday, but now with all the closures I’m so anxious as to whether we should! Our trip falls exactly over this 2 week shut down period. We are very happy just looking at shrines/nature walks/shops/restaurants - but if we go and then those things end up closing? How likely does that seem? We are thinking to swap Hiroshima for Izu at least and spend some time exploring outdoors. I have 24hrs to decide :("
People are just guessing here today but my old people group of Japanese people who I meet every Saturday told me that shrines and temples shouldn’t be closing. Lots of places are closing starting Monday. But not necessarily places where tourists are going besides museums I guess. All public buildings in Kōbe are closing after today but tourists aren’t going to the libraries or taking senior citizen hula dance class or soba making classes or ballroom dancing classes. I’m not sure what to tell you. I’m still on my train from Kōbe to Kyōto right now and it’s usually pretty full with all seats taken and people standing but today there are open seats and no one is standing.I’m going out with friends in Kyōto tonight and a few them have links to tourism and business owners so I can ask them.
"Dont cancel - we are here now and it is all good. Most cultural sights are still operating, and it is great shopping and touring with about 30% less people than usual."
Japan hasn’t “closed its schools” That’s a lie. It’s fake news so the Olympic Games will be secured. It makes it seem like the government is doing something to stem the spread but it’s not really happening. Just lies in the media.
"Speak for yourself Keith, I was absolutely planning on attending a senior citizen hula dance class :-P"
"Well, sorry, Gre... those are cancelled until early-April. :)"
We have our flight also 19.03. But I have not decided yet what can I do :( What do you think about the news that many of the museums and places will be closed till 15.03.20 (source - https://www.japan.travel/en/news/coronavirus/) . If they prolong this date I don't want to left without main sightseeings..
"Impossible to say at this point, Lela and others. Persinally, my feeling is that the numbers here in Japan don't add up: therefore, we don't know how bad it is/will be yet. China responded promptly, and with the full weight of the centralized government, and seems to have the situation under more control (if reports are to be believed). In Japan, we've stayed ""open for business"" and tourism, and there are a lot of reports of under-testing.Upshot: Really too soon to tell what the situation will be like day-by-day, let alone a few weeks from now.FWIW, other than few shortages and the sight closings, daily life hasn't changed all that much here in Tokyo, at least for now.I'm keeping an anecdotal record of news and observations from an expat's pov if you're interested: https://medium.com/tokyo-kills-me/tokyo-coro…"
"Taking the plunge and flying out in the morning :) at the London hotel now. See you soon, Kyoto."
"Have a great flight! One suggestion: bring masks, and tissue/toilet paper with you if you want 'em..."
Safe travels Nestra... the weather should be very nice until Wednesday so enjoy the first couple of days in the sun.
"My Japanese sister in-law who is a school teacher has confirmed schools are closing but staff will still attend. This has little relevance to tourists though, other than it’s another measure to reduce spread of the virus and children are happier."
"What city is she in? I have friends here who are still teaching this week and schools are still having final exams. My school’s 1,100 students are not coming this week but the full staff must commute to school and potentially spread the virus for no reason. Hyogo Prefecture will still hold high school entrance exams this month which means all 3rd year junior high school students will be traveling all over the prefecture to take entrance exams. It’s not a national school “closure” by any means."
"She is in a Osaka, but not sure on the exact timing of closure."
I think the mayor of Osaka is pushing the schools to let students stay home. After being accused of not testing anyone and Osaka being a hotbed of corona due to their lack of care and people being refused from clinics and hospitals. So the school thing is good diversion. Older teachers can catch the virus though and then pass it to the students when they return in 3 weeks. Not a smart plan. But makes for good headlines. Higher level high schools are making their own decisions and letting students take exams and study.
Had the same mentality as you... was so pumped that there would be less tourists! and this morning received an email that my flight has been cancelled... Hope you have better luck!
"Schools in Nerima ward, Tokyo, have closed. Not sure about teachers' status: noticed lights on in the local middle school..."
"Is Anyone still going to Japan??? I am supposed to fly the 19th, SWISS has no intention to refund my tickets, and UK FCO still doesn't advice against not travelling. I am willing to go, also if the risk is that nothing will be open, my must were TeamLab in Tokyo and Naoshima Museum.Is anyone there now who could give an advice of the envinroment there? is it still worth it?"
We're flying Emirates March 10 Amsterdam to Tokyo for a 2 week trip in Japan (Tokyo-Kanazawa-Kyoto-Osaka-Mt Koya-Nagasaki-Tokyo). Mainly visiting temples and shrines. Hopefully museums will open up again 2nd half of March. We'll see. Not too concerned at the moment. Situation up till now not too alarming imho. Looking forward to be in Japan 3rd time.
Team lab is closed.
"Leaving April 18-26th from LA to Tokyo. Hoping things are more clear in the next few weeks, as I have not cancelled yet. I am concerned about 1) Sites, attractions, restaurants and/or hotels being closed, railways between Tokyo-Kyoto being closed, and day trips/tours being cancelled or limited and 2) Not being let back into the US or having to be quarantined upon return."
Please let us know how tourism is!!
Thank you for this clarity!! Are railways operating normally?
"Yes, trains , subways and other transportation are running as usual here."
"Hi there! My girlfirend and I are leaving for Japan on Thursday for a three week trip. We've been reading a lot of forums, travel advices and articles. Although we are very disappointed about the museums closing, we decided to go. Why? (1) We would lose about €600 because there is no negative travel advice. If the advice would change during our stay, our insurance covers all the costs (2) We are not afraid of catching the disease and are confident that, with the correct precautions, we will be fine, (3) there is more to Japan than the national museums (4) public transport is not affected (5) According to locals, life is going on and restaurants are open (6) we actually like the fact that it will be a bit more calm. So if the situation stays like this, we are confident we will enjoy our trip. Cheers!"
"So far, with the dramatic exception of school closures and, more to the point many venues and attractions closed until at least mid-March and events into April being cancelled, it's business as usual. though you still can't buy masks or toilet paper for love or money...However, there's also a general consensus that things could get worse before they get better. And more and more stringent containment procedures are being put into place piecemeal. Last night, my wife and her colleagues had to answer an email questionnaire about any health concerns before she would be allowed into the office today.More people are telecommuting/working from home.Otherwise, it doesn't feel like much has changed.I'm keeping an updated post of an expat's ""view from the ground at ""Tokyo Coronavirus: Is it Safe?"" at https://medium.com/tokyo-kills-me/tokyo-coro…"
"Ant-VP,What a positive outlook, I hope you will enjoy your trip to the fullest !!"
"Just an FYI here to any Canadians, the alert level is now Level 2, but only specifically advised against travel to Hokkaido. Nothing for me has changed, still planning on going April 3rd but will make the call on March 15th to finalize itinerary details with all the closures ending or extending then. Luckily I dont have to decide for myself whether to go or not since my reservations are not refundable as of now and only the government changing the alert level would get me all my money back!"
"Morning all! Arrived yesterday to Narita, and traveled Kyoto. Feeling much more human after a sleep and shower - I’m rubbish with jet lag so let’s see how far I get eh. First time in Kyoto, have only been to Tokyo before. Can only echo everything kobekeith has kindly been updating us on :) First impressions on the surface are that life is fairly business as usual, with more masks. Went shopping to stock our apartment with food last night and there were no empty shelves as some western media has reported, plenty of people out and about enjoying themselves. Temples are open, so we’re heading for a mooch around."
"I am flying to Japan, March 24 and returning April 11. My main concern is flying through South Korea on the way home and what the US goverment will be doing re: travelers to Japan and South Korea."
Welcome Nestra! A little cooler than yesterday but still nice out. Enjoy the day!
Kobekeith - thank you! Weather has been gorgeous this morning (much like an early British summer for us) - we spent a long time just enjoying the grounds at Nijo Castle.
You’re welcome! It’s really sunny and beautiful now in Kōbe on the harbor. Heading back to Kyōto :)

"Asahanasakana, thanks ... I heard about this a few hours ago and again a few minutes ago. :("
"Just got this email from TokyoTransporter......It is regrettable to say this, but the Japanese limousine / taxi company that has long been affiliated and provided services together has been unable to maintain business due to a decrease in sales affected by coronavirus. We unfortunately will suspend business for the time being......Seems a tad weird. I would have thought tourist would be drawing more on these types of services at the moment to avoid crowded public transportation options?Can anyone recommend a reputable company to hire a car and driver from Narita airport to Asakusa?"
"Due to fly to Tokyo from UK via Amsterdam on April 2nd on honeymoon. No chance of refund unless airline cancel of gov advice changes.We are going - for now but will decide in two weeks depending on situation and closures. We are fit and healthy but worried about quarantine in Japan or on return, closures, anxiety during the trip (lots of train travel etc) or cancellation of return flight.Total dampener on the trip now. Trying to be positive - less tourists etc but a lot of concern. I have a feeling that nothing will have changed in two weeks time and we will have to make the decision ourselves."
"We are going in early April until we have official advisory to avoid travel. Or there is a significant spike or outbreak. If we look at the numbers... Canada where we reside currently has no travel ban for tourists from affected area - people still coming from Iran, China, etc. On the contrary, Japan imposed travel ban from these countries long time ago. 37 confirmed cases in Tokyo prefecture vs 20 cases in Ontario... just the matter of time. That makes me think that at the moment I’m equally exposed to virus just walking downtown Toronto or walking downtown Tokyo. Don’t want make anyone to panic but this is true. No reckless decisions though.Edited: 12:07 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"Thank you!As for the plane... this is true. But also I’m in the office for 8 hours a day almost every day, sharing the same air including bathroom and kitchen.

"First-Hand Experience from Tokyo, Wednesday March 4My usual walk from Nishi Tokyo to Kichijoji, both in western Tokyo, this morning.As before, daily life goes on with just a few cosmetic changes. The daycare centre next to my house is open for business as usual, as is the Montessori kindergarten. The local elementary and middle school in my neighbourhood are both closed for classes, but we passed on stalwart young lad with reflective backpack and yellow elementary school cap was making his lonesome way to the temporary daycare set up in one of the schools.The usual flock of bicycles as (mostly) mothers dropped off their young’uns was absent, but as we drew closer to the commuter train station a steady trickle of grey- or blue-suited salarymen and women turned into a river as the trains, of course, life blood of this city, continue to run on time. Some, though not all, wear face masks.Construction and renovation work continues apace in this growing part of the city, despite the virus - and miserable weather. The older, middle-aged in hardhats and safety vests are all masked; the young bucks, in their hakama baggy pants forego helmets and masks for clouds of cigarette smoke.I remember what young and indestructible and indestructible feels like…The local McDonald’s drive-through does a steady business but, unlike in Korea, there are no spot-check facilities outside fast food outlets to get a quick virus check. In fact, access to testing remains a major issue.If I dare to make a generalization, it seems to me that the Japanese government tends to over-think problems and micro-manage solutions, which can sometimes make a situation worse rather than better.Rant over.The first drugstore superstore I pass, just getting ready to open, is moving their produce onto the sidewalk. And… boxes and boxes of tissue paper! Literally the first I’ve seen on sale for a week.The drought is over?!? Let’s see how much is left on my return journey...Local businesses, such as the oshiburi hand cloth laundry and the concrete coring company, are already open for business as usual.Morning classes are running at the Big K Tennis School, students practicing backhands and serves on grass courts in the rain.More people on the streets, more cars and trucks on the road, as I draw closer to Kichijoji and the start of the business day. The local temples and shrines are open for those who prefer not to put their faith in masks. On Sunroad, Kichijoji’s covered shopping streets, something is clearly afoot: long line-ups have already formed outside shops whose shutters are still closed.Clearly, wor is out: tissue paper is back in stock.Starbucks looks and feels like as busy as it usually does, especially for a cold and rainy Wednesday workday morning, but milk and stir sticks are behind the counter, and you must drink from disposable paper cups.Could Trump be right? Big-name franchises are extra cautious with hygiene and quality control ‘cause they don’t want to get sued?Ask me another time about my friend who found an earwig baked into her jacket potato at a Wendy’s in Seoul…I’ll report later whether there’s still tissue for sale by the time I’m walking home.BTW, word is the central government is going to step in and control pricing and distribution of masks in Japan. More on that at Tokyo Coronavirus: Is it Safe? https://medium.com/tokyo-kills-me/tokyo-coro…"
">>> Canada currently has 9 Covid-19 cases vs Japan 293 cases so the risk is not equal walking downtown, therefore you are being paranoid,Just to the point - Canada has 33 cases with 20 of them in Ontario as of the end of March 3.And Tokyo prefecture - 37, Kyoto - 2. And you know what, my work contact is back to work, safe and healthy :)The only thing I'm trying to say is so far Canada is very open to travelers. The only restriction it has is for those who were on Diamond princess. That is somehow concerning."

Definitely karma.... those cruise ship passengers were getting their payback.
"Hello everyone. Everywhere we visited in Kyoto was incredibly quiet yesterday - literally a handful of visitors at each site, and with no entrance inside (e.g. in Nijo castle) it felt very low risk. Entrance prices were halved accordingly too.Shops and restaurants were buzzing though! And some reps from Nagoya health and safety (something like that) were giving out free masks."
"I echo the other posters' thanks for starting this thread. My parter and I are due to arrive in Tokyo on 11 March, we did start to get sucked into the whole media frenzy and started to cancel our hotels and whatnot but we've done loads of researched, read so many forums, spoke to people we know who live or are currently visiting Japan and we've decided to proceed with our trip and enjoy it! We'll be exercising caution (avoiding packed transport, masks, hygiene, avoiding hostels,etc) but we will also enjoy ourselves! We booked this trip to Japan with the refund we received from our last holiday being cancelled in September due to Thomas Cook so having to cancel this will be a blow! (although, I appreciate, a first-world problem!). Hope everyone else enjoys themselves and just exercise caution :-)"
"I'm still travelling next month as long as temples, shrines, parks and gardens remain open. I don't feel at any more risk in Japan than in London and I'm looking forward to less people for the blossoms.I may have to move my itinerary around a bit due to closures and early cherry blossom."
"Just to echo what Nestra said. We are in Kyoto now too and there are no queues at the tourist sights. We commented that it is so quiet that it must be very low risk of infection. The only thing that we haven’t been able to do that we really wanted was to visit the Peace Museum in Hiroshima as it was closed. We walked straight into Himeji Castle, Nijo Castle, Kinkakuji Temple. It’s a great time to be a tourist!!"
https://www.japan-guide.com/news/alerts.html - current closures.
"Meant to be flying out from London on the 22nd. Seriously considering going anyway - the flights won't be refunded (unless the Home Office amends travel advice, which seems unlikely) and we'd only get 50% of our Airbnb costs back. We have until Monday to decide.I spoke to my boss and he told me to enjoy myself and to self-isolate upon my return if I feel unwell so that wouldn't be an issue luckily. Going to Germany to visit family this weekend which now has almost as many confirmed cases as Japan and no one seems to be second-guessing my decision to go there... Fingers crossed that things don't get significantly worse in the next week!"
Our flight is on 17 March. Local authorities recently issued travel advisory to defer non essential travel to Japan without mention for the need to be quarantined upon return.For now we are still thinking to go ahead with our trip. However I came across articles saying that the PM of Japan is trying to expedite the enactment of legislation needed to declare a state of emergency. Anyone with more information about this? How likely you think it will happen?
I'm going from the UK 30/03 unless anything drastic changes.Been told by work that they more than happy for me to self isolate once I'm back.
"My Asiana Airlines flight to Tokyo via Seoul on the 19th has been cancelled, phoned the 3rd party (travel trolley) involved and they said their customer care team would call in the ext few hours (still waiting). They also said something about there still being a flight on the 20th so hopefully we can move it a day late, and possibly our flight back too."
"We must! My MIL lives in Kichijoji and is catatonic. We were there in January, came back to prepare for a 3+ month stay. She has to enter hospice and we must get her condo ready to rent so she has an income. She turns 88 in April.We have to suck up any fears as do our 22 and 16 yo’s who will stay in the states. We are paying for full comprehensive travel insurance to include medical/non-medical evacuation, extensions, accidental death...the whole gamut! If something happens to us, the kids become millionaires who can pay off the house and survive.Our travel is essential and we’re covering all scenarios as best as we can. Unfortunately, transferring in Shinjuku and boarding cramped trains isn’t remotely idealistic. Use your brains, wear a mask, and wash your hands! Wear gloves for escalators, elevator buttons, hand rails during the train rides, and other public fixtures (especially bathrooms). It’s one thing to go to Japan now; it’s another to be haphazard about it! Remember, the 32 yo Chinese doctor who warned the world died in February from Covid 19."
"knight714 (post #150),Did they offer you or mentioned anything about a full refund in this case where your layover is suspended?I have a layover there in April and was wondering how to handle the situation if my layover flight is cancelled."
"You don’t do anything. Your contract with the airline is for them to get you from JFK-NRT. They can choose any routing they want to. If your entire flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a refund."
GOTCHA! Thank you for the info!

Hey there! Your plans still on to travel to Japan? or you considering cancelling or have cancelled? Just curious - im due to travel April 2-16! I'm all pumped go - but would like to make sure I'm not the only one!
"FarAway,I’m still planning to go as long as the airline itself cancels my flight lol because then I have no choice not to go or unless the travel advisory reaches a level 3/4. I’m suppose to go 4/6-4/23"
"We're scheduled to go 4/9 - 4/19 and are currently still planning to go unless the situation gets a lot worse. Our family thinks we're nuts for even considering going, but we are two healthy adults, no kids to take care of, and can work from home if we had to upon return. Of course, it there is a spike here at home (Canada) or in Japan we may have rethink things. Trying to exercise patience!"
"we’re scheduled to visit tokyo from march 25 to april 2 and as of right now, we really want to go. we’ve been monitoring the situation for several weeks now and really hoping that things get better so we can enjoy the trip we’ve planned for many months now. we’ve been lucky cos the airline changed our flight schedule and offered to rebook, reroute or refund our tickets free of charge, and we booked pay at the property, free cancellation hotel rooms. i’m required to undergo a mandatory self quarantine for 14 days before returning to work but the number of work days covered will be paid and will not be deducted from my earned leave credits. we will not be incurring any financial loss if we do decide not to go and we have until march 23 to decide. i know it sounds crazy but even if we have fully refundable tickets and cancellable hotel rooms, we still want to go cos we really wanna see the sakura in full bloom and i think this is our best chance to appreciate sakura without so many tourists milling about. what worries me now is the possibility of getting quarantined in japan if a fellow passenger or hotel guest tests positive, and the possibility of getting infected. hope things get better in japan and the rest of the world so all of us can happily proceed with our travels."

"Due to uncertainty with our flights via Korea and at least one leg being cancelled we booked new flights with Air France which were actually cheaper, faster and give us an extra half day in Japan.We've also got a full refund from Asiana which annoyingly will take 6 weeks to process.We're still really excited about going but if these flights get cancelled too we'll probably just call it quits and rebook when the situation gets better.Does anyone think the Prime Minister's speech will outline tourism restrictions?"
"I don't think so. If he does, that means giving up Olympics.Recently, the news are talking about the medicine that cured three critical cases and the clusters of livehouses and fitness club. It seems to be reasonably controlled."
Hi there. Did you book directly with Asiana as there's a notice on their website saying our return flights (via Seoul) have been suspended? We booked through Opodo and I did the hanging on the line for over an hour last night. They are cancelling our flights but presume we will get a full refund eventually if they were suspended by Asiana - am still waiting for my Air China refund from over a month ago - the Asiana was far more expensive replacement for those so out of pocket twice and we've given up!!
"Hi SallyWe found the flights via skyscanner so they ended up being booked through travel trolley.they were a nightmare to get through to as I kept getting told to wait for someone to call me, and they finally did at 10.30 last night! They said there was an alternate flight they day after but I said no and that I wanted a refund. Glad I did and we're now changing in Paris!Edited: 10:52 am, March 06, 2020 "
"Also, a later email from them said:""Please be advised that as per recent advisory received from airline, you can cancel this reservation and can claim full refund against cancellation due to coronavirus outbreak.""So I'm sure this would apply to you as well"
"Thanks, am hoping that will be the case though Opodo just said it was a confirmed booking and didn't seem to be aware of the flight suspensions.......Thank you though, hope to go next Easter instead!"
Good luck and hope you get there ok. My neighbour's daughter lives in Japan and said she wasn't concerned about the virus but that a lot of places were getting closed - hopefully only temporarily but we're trying again Easter 2021
"I was still planning to go to Japan and was still very excited to go since it took months of planning, but however, Asiana has suspended my flights.Going to contact the booking agency and see what will happen from there.."
"I think it’s getting harder for people to say they’re “still going to Japan” with so many things being cancelled or places closing. But I’ll try to encourage the ones who are still coming with reports if they’re interested. The plum blossoms were beautiful on Friday afternoon in Kyōto. Kyōto Station wasn’t dead but it was clearly not as crowded as usual. The Shijo & Kawaramachi shopping area was busy-ish and all of the stores were open. Daimaru Department Store was a little busy. I walked by Nishiki Market and it was buzzing but also probably much less crowded than usual. Went to a cafe near Teramachi Shotengai shopping arcade and enjoyed a late lunch with just a few people in there. Next stop, we went to Pontocho Alley for a drink at a quiet curry cafe which was dead. We were the only customers there. Pontocho Alley was very quiet for an early Friday evening but it was nice to not have to avoid it for a change. The bridge crossing over to Gion was busy and Gion itself had quite a few people. Stopped for a matcha tiramisu at a wagashi cafe. Next, we went to a craft beer bar near the Kabuki Theater. We were the only customers there too. One guy stopped by the take away window to get a craft beer draft on the go. Yes, they have craft beer on tap for take out in Gion!? We then went to a cool new cocktail bar again and were the only customers there too. We were the only customers in 3 nights. New businesses without established clientele not on the super busy streets are hurting and it’s a shame to see them suffering. A lot of cool “off the beaten path” places may not survive this corona crisis. After the cocktail bar, we had a late dinner at an OKONOMIYAKI shop and then called it a night. People still trying to live life normally here. I feel bad for the owners who don’t have other customers but it’s kind of comfortable not having to wonder if people next to you in a cafe, bar or restaurant has the virus. I get enough of that kind of worrying or thinking on the crowded JR trains every day. Good luck everyone.Edited: 12:07 am, March 07, 2020 "
"Thank you for the update.Meant to be heading there in 3 weeks, still unsure. What was it like getting through the airport? Were they questioning people, temperature testing?"
"We are in exactly the same situation. DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. Mostly worried about potential quarantine in Japan, bringing the virus back and not being able to enjoy the trip because things are closed or just being paranoid about falling ill."
"We are still intending to go to Osaka at the moment ( arriving 28/3 via Singapore from Brisbane).Our trip is to see our daughter and grandchildren primarily, with possible day trips to Kurashiki and Kyoto and cherry blossom viewing.We didn’t intend to visit any of the sites that are closed, but will probably see a few temples not seen on previous visits.I must admit that the hysteria around visiting Japan has affected me, and if Singapore Air offered us a refund we’d probably be tempted to take it.We can change our dates of travel for free but only up to August. I know that summer in Japan is horribly hot, so the latest I’d want to visit is during May. And the reason we originally booked for late March was because our grandkids would be on school holidays then.Would the situation even be any better in May, or perhaps it might be worse?We really don’t know what to do."
"OceanSkyBeach, I don’t think anyone knows yet how it will be in May. I don’t blame you for not wanting to come here in summer though. It’s really miserable here. The first 2 weeks of June are often very good, weather-wise right before the rainy season starts so maybe end of May into June if you change your dates? The prime minister is making everyone wait until March 10 to make an announcement regarding the virus situation so maybe you should wait to see what he will say."
If anyone is still intending to go then just keep in mind if you are travelling with children your school may require a 14 day period stay at home on your return also the same goes if you work in the health or aged care industry . Every day more and more work places are putting this as a return to work requirement so you better check should this be the case on your return is your employer going to pay your wages during this time or does it have to come out of your sick or holiday leave e.t.c . The chances of contracting the virus is very minimal and as seasoned travellers not something that bothered us in the least .The reasons the majority of people are cancelling is all the daily changes to ever increasing quarantine regulations plus you better be 100% sure your travel insurance covers you for any eventuality almost all of them when you read the PDD's exclude Epidemic and Pandemic's. Another consideration as is happening right now should you get any symptoms of a cough or fever which is quite common when you travel your hotel in Japan can require you to remain in your room and have to report that you are ill . It is a horrible dilemma as cancelling damages the countries tourist industry tremendously but on the other hand when the country advises its own citizens to avoid all non essential travel we made a very late call only 2 days before we were due to leave to postpone . Fortunately our loss was only $450 for flight and insurance cancellation fees still not good but better than some we have heard .
"Thanks kobekeithWe’ll definitely wait until 10 March to make a decision. In fact, our last date for deciding is 19 March as that’s the last chance to be able to cancel one of our hotels without penalty.I do wonder if anything will really change by 19 March though, or if the decision will be any easier to make. The silly thing is that we have Covid-19 in Australia now too, just not as many cases as in Japan."
"Firstly, thank you to all the locals, expats, tourists, etc. that continue to post updates as to what it’s like in Japan at the moment. For the people who have trips booked the additional information is very helpful.My husband and I are booked to go for two weeks starting 28 March. We are more fortunate than some in that it’ll be our third trip to Japan. Therefore many of the things on the closure lists like USJ we have already visited. That being said, it’s still disappointing and like other to-be travelers we’re concerned that places like restaurants, cafes, and department stores will start closing soon too. My husband was also devastated that his Toyota factory tour was cancelled, which we planned our whole trip around due to the availability of the tour! We’re going to try to make a firm decision on the 10th either way.We’re desperate to go but on the other hand, we’ve paid so much money (like, double what we should have paid for many of the hotels given that it’s over Sakura season) that I had really high expectations. It’s looking more and more that we paid a lot of money for what is turning out to be a very low-key holiday given all the closures.Edited: 3:14 am, March 07, 2020 "
"Hi! I'm supposed to go Hokkaido for skiing in Niseko but decided to postpone my trip. Can anyone advise if you think this Covid-19 issue will tone down by first week of April? Airline and accomodation do not agree to refund, but reschedule to a later date.Anyone with info on current Covid-19 situation in Niseko?"
"Hello, We are planning on going to Japan the 28 of March but we have flights booked with a connection in Beijin. With the recent news of travel ban from china we are a bit concerned. Would the quarantine affect us? We would be flying from Frankfurt, Germany. Thank you!"
My wife and I have been travelling through Asia since December. Planning on going to Japan in a couple weeks and super excited for the lack of crowds.. (Imagine the photos you can finally get without all the people in them)I recommend good insurance. There aren't many insurance companies that'll cover the Corona Virus. But I did find one. Short 4 minute vlog if you're interestedhttps://youtu.be/f7iFyqKq72c
"What was it like getting through the airport? Were they questioning people, temperature testing?We got into Tokyo about 5 days ago and there was no temperature checking or questioning of health and apart from observation decks and museums being closed Tokyo seems rather unaffected. The tourist attractions are still bustling with visitors apart from Meji Temple though we were there early in the morning so that could have been its normal state. We are now in Ishigaki and the locals here seem unconcerned as we have seen only Japanese tourists wearing masks."
"#182 Thanks for the recognition! Many of us put considerable time and effort into providing as accurate info as possible.In addition to PM Abe's speech on March 10th, he is expected to be granted emergency powers on Friday March 13. I don't think anyone knows if he plans to act on those new powers immediately, or if they are ""just in case."" They include provisions for expanded school closures, quarantine, restricted business hours, perhaps more?My advice to everyone - at least those with the luxury of choice - is to put off any travel decisions top or within Japan until at least the 13th. I continue to update Tokyo Coronavirus: Is it Safe? if you want more info and opinion from an expat in Tokyo https://medium.com/tokyo-kills-me/tokyo-coro…"
"Is it still just museums and such closed, or are restaurants and shops closing too? Also is the Kappabashi still functioning?"
"It’s mostly still that, lovespastries. I saw a handful of places closed on Saturday night which surprised me a little because they’re always open but not too many. The well-established businesses are still kind of busy whereas other newer businesses without many reviews or social media presence are dead and hurting.  I saw a line outside of a popular bar on Kiyamachi Street last night that always has a line and they’re not hurting too badly I guess."

#190 wants Germans to die.
Sunday afternoon and evening in Kyōto have been great so far. Rainy morning but the afternoon was great. Kiyamachi is as busy as Saturday and Friday nights were which is a little odd because Sunday nights tend to be slower. A sushi restaurant on Pontocho Alley had a long line outside at 7:30 pm. So we are now in a slightly more expensive place with no line. Kyōto is still open and people are living their lives.
"Hi all - how is everyone doing? Has anyone flown out here recently & how are you finding it? After six days in Kyoto (everything buzzing, tourist spots clearly much quieter than usual but far from empty), we have been spending a few nights in Nara.Although the Nara National Museum is closed, all the temple and shrine museums showcasing art and treasures are very much open. Weather has been gorgeous. Again, far from empty but nowhere near as crowded as I expect it usually is. A restaurant owner was telling me that it’s incredibly quiet as most tourists he serves usually are from China. No queues for anything. Small crowd at the Shunie ceremony. Of all the visitors, tourists seem to be mostly made up of young Japanese couples and families. Of course we are doing all we can to stay virus-free while we’re here, but we’ve not had to think much about avoiding crowds as there simply aren’t many. Tomorrow we head to Tokyo for our final few days"
"#195 thanks for your update, it's very encouraging to read, please keep us all posted."
"Did anyone fly from France? We've got flights from London to Tokyo, changing in Paris and I'm trying to figure out how likely it is our flight might be cancelled.I saw that a lot of 5pm flights from London to Paris have been cancelled, but no others, presumably because of less demand. France isn't as badly hit with the virus as South Korea but it's still one of the highest in Europe"
glad to hear that #195! Keep us posted. I imagine once the prime minister makes his announcements sometime in the next 24 hours things may change.
"We are booked to leave for a Japan on the 27th of March 2020, it's now March 10 and we have no itinery so we're not so sure where or when we will get there. We booked a tour with Wendy Wu last year which cost over $40000for 4 of us..Following the travel alert s our age ( were all in our mid to late sixties) and underlying health issues asked what Wendy Wu could do for us.. the answer was 100% cancellation fee or change to next year with the tour company keeping our $40000 and we had to give them mother $12000.. so looks like we are going to Japan but we just don't know when !!"
"Can anyone report on how it is staying in AirBnb's - we are set to go for 3 weeks in April/May with no pre arranged lodging for 4 people. I am wondering if the fact that we are from US where there is a ""substantial"" out break if we will be considered ""damaged goods"" and they won't want us to stay with them?? Anyone experiencing any issues with finding lodging through Airbnb or discrimination due to being from US?I am not worried about getting sick - I am more concerned with being put into quarantine upon our return. My husband and I could work remotely - but it's my pets back home that would suffer. And what if our government decides to close the boarders while we are away? UGH. This is all so new, we are experienced travelers but have never seen anything like this."
Omg! I’m so happy someone feels the same way I do. My trip is booked for Tokyo from April 9-16. It’s my sons high school graduation trip. I’m super excited but not too overly concerned but I’m getting weird looks from everyone when I tell them I’m still going.
I’m so happy I found this thread. I’m getting weird looks for everyone when I tell them I’m still going. They make me feel like I’m a crazy person. I’m going with my 2 sons (17 and 22) and we are super excited. Of course we will take precautions just like we are doing here in New York.

"The bill to grant/extend (depends on who you ask) the power to declare a state of emergency passed as expected today. There's two more votes, but both ar econtrolled by Abe's LDP Party and there is no doubt the bill will pass.Two important things to remember:1. just because the bill passes, it does NOT mean that any or all measures will go into effect immediately2. Of the details I have seen, the provisions may greatly affect those already in Japan; HOWEVER it does not appear to have anything to do with banning/quaranting arrivees, etc. I've posted an outline of the new bill's provisions as best I've been able to gather at https://medium.com/tokyo-coronavirus/tokyo-c…"
"We booked our trip Feb 11and we are hoping to be in Japan Apr 11-24, unless Canada changes the travel advisory to “avoid travel” or AirCanada extends the goodwill policy to after our departure date, all the hotels we booked can be canceled the day before our departure, so no worries there. Like many people posting on this tread, we are not overly concerned with getting sick, instead our worries are being allowed to go but not enjoying ourselves because of the attractions closures or that things escalate so out of control during our time in Japan that we are quarantined when we get back home. As this situation evolves, we will continue keeping an eye on new developments, not much more we can do for now. One thing that really helps are the updates posted on forums like this one from our fellow travellers currently in Japan, so please keep them coming, they’re greatly appreciated!!!!!!"
Is there any news about when Museum etc will re open compare to the first statement saying that they will be closed until the 16th of March? Has this date been postponed?
"Hey Arte P,Just to say, while I have heard some rumours that closures might be extended (the number I've heard is 10 days), I haven't seen anything in the media or on the websites of major attractions such as, randomly, Disney, Tokyo National Museum, and Tokyo Photographic Magazine, all of which still say the 15th-16th i s the last day of closure.However, it's always been understood here (in Tokyo) that a mid-March re-opening sounded like hopeful thinking...My suggestion? Check the english webpage of one of the sites you want to visit tomorrow, just in case there's a lag in updating the webpage, and see if the dates have been changed."
It isn't a rumor but a fact. I watched the TV news and at least twice they told that the Prime Minster made that request at a conference and I also saw the footage of it.They need ten more days to slow the spread and the experts will make judgment in a meanwhile checking the situation of Hokkaido.
Hopefully the venues will update their websites soon so that visitors can make informed decisions.
"Yes, Thanks. Can't find any official news yet. Still on doubt if to come to Japan or not, I am supposed to leave London the 19th... hope to have a clearer view by the 13th..."
"#202, ""I’m getting weird looks for everyone when I tell them I’m still going. They make me feel like I’m a crazy person. ""Have you wondered whether they were thinking about how they can treat you professionally upon your return, but still maintain a safe distance? They probably know they are not in a position to tell you not to go, but they will have to work with you when you return.This is not specific to Japan, you probably will get the same reaction when you tell them you are going on a vacation near Seattle, Washington."
"Well, it cannot be helped. The request was made seven hours or so ago and it really depends on the current situation.The venues are following the requests. The Government and the experts are checking the increase of numbers and the situation so it is impossible to go ahead of those.Kabuki performance announced that the resumed date would be delayed yesterday."
"Not sure what to say about the 13th.The only thing I've heard specific to the 13th is that the energency bill which passed today will be finalized on Friday. But that doesn't mean the powers will be exercised. At least not right away. Hopefully venues will update their closure dates in the next day or two, but do keep in mind that re-opening dates are only speculative. No-one knows when this will be over... Not trying to discourage you, just saying I think it'll be hard to find anything definitive to help you make that decision."
"The 19th is said to be the day that they would make the decision if they could say it's OK to have baseball games and soccer games with spectators or not.Did you imagine the number at your own country would have a sharp increase last week? I guess a week ago in European and American countries, it was a completely different situation: just blaming the Asian countries."
"It is very hard from to understand what is the reality.From the numbers, Japan doesn't look as worrying as before https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/But I have been reading lot of articles saying that the situation could actually be much worse."
"No, it’s just because I’m going to Japan. I’m not going straight back to work when I get back so I hope that makes them feel better. But I don’t plan on cancelling my trip."
"Arte, it still seems like things are pretty normal here. Not sure how it’s being told in the media as I’ve not been paying too much attention to it. My friends and family outside of Japan seem to think it’s pretty dangerous here and we’re doomed. I’ve gone out shopping and had lunch out with friends this week and have gone to a “sayonara” party for another friend. Other friends went to a “live house” on Sunday and said it was a full house for the rock bands playing. People are saying it’s going to get worse but that’s just speculation based on what they’re hearing. Most people think that places that are already closed won’t be opening up again next week. It seems too soon to everyone."
"Arte, I don't think it is that tragic, but we are asked by the Government to refrain from unessential gatherings.By refrain from going out in big numbers, the number of increase is in a less sharp curve. If that curves become sharp, the hospitals won't have enough beds for the infectious, and especially that will be critical for the elderly with chronic diseases, so the Japanese are asked to cooperate by closure of places that people gather to slow down the increase of numbers to be hospitalized.I don't care about people who don't listen and check the news. Many clusters are reported at four or five livehouses in Osaka and Sapporo as hot spots, so definitely going to livehouses is a risky thing for a time being. Confined placees without change of air are advised to be places to avoid.The museums might not reopen this month, but the Sakura with less crowd will welcome anybody coming to Japan.Edited: 8:34 am, March 10, 2020 "
Here is one of the sources that you can find about why it is the 19th.https:/…0006408633
"Thanks for the link to the article, Global, 715255!Kyodo news has published a fairly comprehensive list of info re: developments March 10th:Here’s an article from Kyodo News with comprehensive coverage of yesterday’s developments from the Abe government, including extended closures, the emergency powers bill, and new travel bans on Iran, Italy, and San Marino.Japan PM Abe calls for event cancellations for additional 10 days over virus. https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/03/2…FYI, the new emergency powers bill does not seem to contain anything targeted specifically at travelers.

"Hi. Finally found this forum.For now, I haven't changed my plan for my trip to Japan in early April but anyone can suggest which travel insurance is the best options for now? Leaning towards Japanese insurance company like t*kio or s*mpo but some people say Ass*st C*rd is the best (?) Anyone have opinions about this?"
"Hello All,We are also planning to visit Japan.Our direct flight from London is next Wednesday with BA (which we booked very far in advance).To all who's based in JPN: what would you do? Would you go? Would you stay at home (with ££££ non-refundable trip)?Thanks!"
"#224 About insurance, checking the thread below might be better.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29423…"
"I don't think it's a case of fake negativity that is causing issues for most people, but a genuine concern for how things could turn (for better or worse) and lack of a crystal ball for how things will pan out. For me, I'm still in a position where I have to go in April as the flight has not been cancelled and the government has not issued a travel warning / ban. While it is very encouraging that many recent returners have said life is going on and the crowds are fewer, it is a worry that the government will action the state of emergency bill. We have seen from other countries how quickly things can escalate (thinking of the poor residents and tourists in Italy). I had taken some comfort in that the Japanese seem to be taking excellent precautions and that the daily infection rates had gone down for several days in a row, but am worried that this has now jumped up again. There are so many variables at the moment and it's such a rapidly developing story that it's difficult to know what to think."
"https:/…coronavirusCOVID19.The number is going up when they find a cluster.The main clusters they are talking about these days is four or five livehouses in Osaka and some preschool and day care centers. Some people coming back from Nile Cruise are testing positive these days.　Japan is not in a condition of declaring state of emergency in a few weeks or so. We will do the best to avoid that before the Olympics. The medical systems are one of the best in the world. I guess we have less people with chronic diseases than the Western countries, which is shown by the number of death from the COVID19 are not high compared to the number of active carriers .The most important thing is your physical condition and if you find washing hands troublesome or not. :-)Edited: 10:17 am, March 11, 2020 "
"#226 Thanks Global for the link. Seems like I'll need to find more information before purchasing one. What do you think about the situation for tourist? I'm more into temple and nature, so I'm okay with the closed museum and theme park (ofcourse I'm a bit sad that USJ and Osaka Aquarium were temporary closed) but do you think it still save to roam around Kobe and Osaka (especially since I read about the live music place). Will it be hard for me to find restaurant to eat?"
"The restaurants will welcome you.  I don't know if it is safe for you or not because I don't know how old you are or if you have chronic disease or not.The most important thing is to wash your hands often. If you're not confident in doing that, postpone your trip.https:/…newpage_00032.html"
There's a lot of chatter in my office about London getting 'locked down' in the next week or two.I don't think it's based on anything other than a quote from an academic but it's still freaking me out a bit!Fingers crossed it happens after we fly out on the 19th
"Why? Is the number seriously going up in London now?I met a London doctor last month. She said if she washed her hands, no worries."
"It's had its biggest rise, up 83 in a day. Still nowhere near the worst hit, but it's sure to get a lot worse in the next couple of weeks"
Has anyone been to robot restaurant in the past week? want to know how all the shopping places are and the clubs?? Busy not busy? Any changes?
"ALSO getting married in late April and are planning our honey moon, a week in japan and a week in bali.. any thoughts or ideas on this, were in such limbo right now. Coming from Los Angeles. But We are the types of travelers that like to get lost, try everything, explore and have adventure! Not so much into museums and stuff like that. I guess im just looking for any thoughts.. thats all :))"
"Well I could say Bali still safe for now. Our government is quite strange with the information, so they don't announce the location for the corona virus patient. I think it still concentrated in Jakarta.I'm also still waiting for my Japan trip so I can't comment much about it"
"Partner and I have a trip to Tokyo for 5 days in early June, a dream trip for sure and will not cancel unless there is a government travel ban.I am worried about businesses being closed - I know there is a Sailor Moon Theater/Dinner show that was closed for a week and not sure if it's open again. Are most businesses open? I can only hope the next 3 months they are able to contain this virus and life can resume to normalcy."
"Just arrived in Tokyo (Narita) last night. N'ex was almost empty. Subway line however busy at 8 pm, everyone wearing masks. A young salary man escorted us to the entrance of the new Keio line at Shinjuku station as it is difficult to find.....that's why I love japan!"
I'm meant to fly out at the end of May and the ONLY thing that would make me cancel is in the unlikely case of my flights being cancelled or if Tokyo Disneyland is still closed by early June. As Tokyo Disney is a main reason for my travel!
"Same, a group of myself and 3 other girls are going as well from the US. We're all carefully following the news. A bit of a bummer that park and festival closures with continue into the beginning of April as, PM Abe as asked for 10 days extra of closures. Still excited to go, but will bring a lot of hand sanitizer."
I have my tripped planned from the 16-30 April. I've been planning this vc since October last year for my 30th birthday present to myself. But currently I'm sitting on the fence about whether to go or not. I'm keeping a close eye on all developments. Cathay Pacific has already stated it has suspended flights between HK and Haneda till the end of March. Don't know yet about April...Japan currently has +-600 cases although that number is certainly going to rise as Japan is not doing a lot of testing for the virus. Japan is also seeking to pass a bill on Friday that would give the prime minister the power to call a state of emergency. Which would give the government the power cancel event facilities and order people to stay indoors (currently it is only voluntary). Kyodo news and NHK are great sources for information.I really don't want to cancel but if the current situation continues I might not have that much of a choice
"Air Canada just canceled our flights, I guess we are going to miss the cherry blossoms this year. We’ll try to rebook for this summer around the Olympics, but I’ll do a lot of research before I book, I would imagine affordable accommodations and event tickets are very hard to score. Good luck to all of you still travelling this spring!!!"
"#234: No. The latest is 459. And the growth was ~10% or less DoD.I don't think they'll lock down the UK/London unless the number will dramatically go up DoD.Many people are working from home and you'll see significantly less people on streets. However, most if not all public places are still open/working as usual."
When were you due to leave? I am flying with air canada as well. I’m meant to tease April 8. I’m wondering will they cancel my flight closer to my departure date.
https:/…anchorDoes anyone know if things are starting to re-open?Based on that list above it looks like they might be but obviously unconfirmed.
">>>Japan currently has +-600 cases although that number is certainly going to rise as Japan is not doing a lot of testing for the virus.Just FYI, numbers in almost any country are going to rise. You have equal chances to catch something almost anywhere (unless you are in an epicenter). You can check the official numbers including active cases and tests done here https:/…newpage_00032.html"
"Our flight was April 10, as far as I can tell they only canceled the flight from Calgary to Tokyo, all the other flights I think are still going. AC announced yesterday changes to the rebooking policy, you should check their website you might find some useful information."
"We need to fight this pandemic together, and each of us has to do his/her part. We should cancel or postpone all nonessential travel for now.I know that some of you, myself included, would lose some money if you cancel, but you need to set your priorities straight."
#247 Not many will resume before March 19.Tokyo Disney Resort will resumre in April.
"Adrian, everything is still closed. And we’ve been hearing that closures were extended for the whole month. Our school “closures” were also officially extended yesterday even though we all knew they would be. We were officially notified by the prefectural government about the dates being extended. Bars are still open and from what I just heard on the phone when my stupid friends woke me up at 2:30 a.m. they sound pretty crowded for a Thursday night. “Are you coming to Kiyamachi?!?!? We’re waiting for you at ........”"
AL_0427 I am travelling to Seoul on 1st April and on 8th April from Seoul to Tokyo. My flight hasn't been cancelled but I'm worried they may extend the quarantine policy into April.
"Call me crazy. IM GOING! Yolo. I’m boarding now and will be in Tokyo tomorrow. I still can’t believe it’s finally happening. I got a ton of face masks (i know but it makes people around us feel safer), got tons of hand sanitizer and alcohol wipes. I did not wanna miss sakura season. My only thing is missing out on Borderless but besides that my itinerary hasn’t changed! Stay safe guys!"
When were you supposed to leave ? I’m wondering if AC will cancel my flight from Montreal to Tokyo on March 24th. And wanted to know how long in advance they cancelled yours.
Robot resto is closed.
"Hello all - hope you’re doing well. Today is our final full day in Japan having spent our last 3 nights in Tokyo. I guess Tokyo is quieter for tourists, but you couldn’t really tell. As bustling as previous visits. Asakusa yesterday in the sun was by far the busiest tourist spot I’ve been to over the last two weeks, mainly Japanese teenagers enjoying time in traditional dress. It’s a nice atmosphere. But still not packed like usual. Lots of those man-pulled-rikishaws sat twiddling their thumbs which is unfortunate for local self employed tourist businesses. Shibuya, Akiba, Kappabashi etc. all busy. Shops and restaurants open. Tokyo Tower was also open last night and we enjoyed a quiet trip up there with only a handful of other guests."
Oh it’s worth adding that you have to be temperature checked before going up Tokyo Tower and high temperatures won’t be admitted (they check after you pay which seems kind of cheeky). And when you are up there they have a team of cleaners disinfecting the windows and handrails as you look round.
"Wow, Nestra!? It seems like you just got here!?!"
"Igor, I’m not going to call you crazy for coming here but I’ll call you crazy for your very dramatic posts yesterday saying how devastated you were and were “100% not going now” and now here you are. :)Your posts made me lose 2 hours on the phone with KLM trying to get a refund and then probably a year off of my life stressing out when the supervisor kept saying that my flights can’t be refunded and the one from Osaka isn’t cancelled and the one from Amsterdam to Boston is still scheduled next week even with the new restrictions for flights from Europe to the USA!?!? Either I go or .... not sure. Safe travels! Everything is still going on here that will be fun for tourists. (Minus the previous closures on other threads)"
14 days is all my holiday allowance will stretch to kobekeith! Goes so quick with the flights zapping 2 days. We will be back again one day I’m sure.
That’s true. Those 2 days are unavoidable. I’m still on the fence for my departure to Amsterdam in 2 days! Enjoy the last day?
"We had to make the decision to cancel earlier. As a nurse, I was confident that I would've been able to stay safe during the trip, but the alarming numbers popping up worldwide prompted our hospital to issue a ban on travel or risk unpaid quarantine. Patient safety comes first! Stay safe out there everyone and I hope anyone who chooses to travel has a great trip nonetheless. Wash your hands!"
"Sorry to hear that the First lady in Canada tested positive, John. It is also sad to hear that we have clusters at day care centers affecting the elderly in Kansai, west side of Japan.You will be needed at your home country now more than other times as a nurse. Stay safe!!"
"Nestra, welcome to Tokyo.Did you see the sakuras?I saw the weeping cherry in front of the gate of Sensoji Temple at Asakusa blooming yesterday. If you missed it, there are also big trees at the entrance of Ueno Park blooming pink, Okanzakura and the weeping cherry. I hope you saw some Sakuras already. Have a nice day!!"
"Global, yes we have thank you in Asakusa :) there were also some in Kyoto so we have been very Lucky considering how early it is!"
"I understand your situation! I’ll have to do the same. No posting pics on Instagram. Or every new pic will be titled “throwback” because I was there 3 times last year anyway. :) “this is a good throwback memory from my last trip...” “Working” from home will help with that jet lag, Nestra."
That is good seeing some people are still going. Mine isn’t until May so it’s somewhat encouraging.
Uff. Sorry for that kobekeith!!! Goes to show how crazy of a couple last weeks it has been for me.
No worries! Are you already here?!
and based on today's government warning? Still going?
Which country’s government?
"Australian government advice today is to avoid all non-essential international travel. It's an overall, non-specific travel advisory. It's not a ban on travel though, so airlines are not giving refunds for cancellations (or at least not yet).Kobekeith, the word is that schools here are soon to close, but teachers will still have to come to work as usual. So I'll be in same position that you've been in - just hanging around in an empty classroom or passing the time in the staffroom. Fun times!"
"Good question, Kobekeith.Japan is Level 2 according to CDC, the same it's been since the virus first broke out. (Same as the UK and Australia.) There is no travel ban from the US to Japan or vice versa. There are countries that are on the US travel ban in the EU which are on Level 1, meaning ""normal precautions,"" so the ""travel ban"" is pretty meaningless and just political. American citizens returning from Europe ""might"" have the virus, too. It's not necessarily ""the travelers from Europe"" that ""seeded"" the virus. Here is the list of countries that have banned or are putting on a quarantine on those who are traveling from Japan. It's not clear whether they mean Japanese passports or anyone who has been there recently. It's from the Japanese government's website, so you'll need to google translate. https:/…Edited: 4:34 am, March 13, 2020 "
"If you’re in Australia, the Gov advisory level for Japan is now at a Level 3:https:/…japanThis means that if you had travel insurance and you decide to cancel your trip, you may be refunded for some things. This is what I was told by our insurer Budget Direct anyway when I took out insurance last month. I am yet to test this information.My heart goes out to everyone that had a trip booked and is now canceling. We’ve had this trip booked for over a year and it’s likely we won’t be able to reschedule to anytime soon so we share your disappointment."
Thanks Mamajelli! :)MomPlusOne... it’s mind numbing doing that every day. And makes me wonder why us teachers are expendable or disposable. I’ve had enough paid vacation for the last days of the official school year before spring vacation so I’m home. It’s almost as boring but with much more food and a bigger TV. And I’m already starting to think “I guess I could wax the floors...” I should be packing for Amsterdam & the USA. :(Good luck to you !
I have been so optimistic and haven't cancelled my flights yet (also if I can get full refund)... I am supposed next Thursday from UK but I guess now it is getting real that no one is going anywhere no more... :(
@kobekeith: I arrive Saturday 4pm NRT time
"@Igor if you have time let us know how is the situation there... I will hold my ticket until the last moment (18th) to see if I can still get there! As per today, UK has now more active cases than Japan... at least on paper..."
@igor... so you still have a long way to go. :)Another 15 hours from now!? Safe travels.
"Seems like we're still going on Thursday, but we'll leave it to the last minute to buy a rail pass. Handily one of the vendors does collection.Part of me is worried about the morality of going. We're both young and healthy and are following all the procedures and fortunately can work from home when we get back, but there's still a slight risk of becoming a carrier.Anyone else grappling with the dilemma?Edited: 10:42 am, March 13, 2020 "
Do you know where the first lady of Canada visited before she tested positive?
"I visited a bakery in Ueno, Tokyo today.The customers can pick out the items. I was surprised to see each one was put into plastic bags, so we don't worry when eating that somebody accidentally touched it or not. How thorough the Japanese are when it comes to matter of hygienity!!"
@Arte: will do! I will give a quick update once i been there a full day.
"i understand the stress! I’m going from 3rd of May to the 12th, my partner and I both can study from home for quarantine when we return, and are young healthy and plan on taking all precautions. However the stress off the possibility of cancelled flights or travel bans has taken away from the exciting somewhat, we still do intend on going 100% unless travel bans are implemented and there was no option. I also worry that japan will be empty and we may not enjoy it as much, anyone in japan right now able to share their experience? Are you still enjoying your trip and is japan still somewhat normal. I’m still super excited just nervous about the uncertainties. Please anyone let me know! :c I hope anyone going to Japan right now still has an amazing time c:"
"@skycommander I’m going in May too, are you still intending to go. I’m in Aus and unless there’s a travel ban I’m still intending on going, not cancelling anytime soon anyways, I guess we will see in April what the plans are for May :c best of luck to us!"
"Ignore the sick nationalistic posts everyone. It’s too bad there are these types of Japanese people on a travel forum. Especially with their lies, deflections and ridiculous posts. It’s sad to see people celebrating the suffering of others."
"Hi All, thanks for sharing all the info, reports and thoughts. I've been following this thread for a while and It's been pretty encouraging as I wasn't thinking about cancelling anytime soon... until now: This next tuesday, flights coming from Europe, US, China, S. Korea, Japan and Iran to Buenos Aires are cancelled for at least 30 days... I was going to travel this monday (for about 5 weeks), which I guess I still could do, but then risking not being able to come back.Don't know what to do yet, as American Airlines isn't aswering atm... but I guess I'm staying.To those who are able to make it, enjoy and be safe!JonEdited: 1:19 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Knight714, you can also buy JR pass after you get to Japan at JR offices. It would be 1000 yen or so more expensive than you get it abroad.Japan cannot be empty, Harri. Sorry not from the tourist's point of view but a Tokyo local.Tokyo is a city of 13 million. People might be a little nervous compared than usual and prefer to spend more time at home but life goes on as normal so far. We are nervous but not many of us are panicking. I don't feel I need to evacuate to somewhere else yet.Right now, many of us are avoiding drinking parties, but still people will have picnic at Ueno Park on a warm day like yesterday. You can see kids are having fun at parks, too. Well, if it becomes like some of the European countries, maybe the majority needs to stay at home but we are still enjoying the coming of Spring so far.Some local governments are worrying about restaurants and other businesses having hard times, so some closures might reopen soon, but we still have to be patient a little more.Many companies are asking their employees to work from home, so the trains are less crowded and if you cough, everybody is quite nervous so they might stare at you, and it is quite hard to buy face masks but except that, life is going on. Tourist spots are less crowded but not empty. There is still a month and a half in your case, Harri, so wait and see how things will go might be better.Edited: 1:36 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Can anyone who lives in Japan at the moment answer my question(s) in #225? If you were tourists who planned their first trip to Japan (Tokyo and Kyoto), would you go (and why)? Thanks."
"Hfot2, I guess you know this Yokozakura near Kiyomizukannondo at Ueno Park. It started to bloom one week earlier than usual. I hope you can see it next year.https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g14134278-d320441-Reviews-Ueno_Park-Uenokoen_Taito_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html#photos;aggregationId=&albumid=&filter=7&ff=455501473"
Canada advises against all international travel. I guess the decision is made for me. Very upset.
-HarriStill intending on going but perplexed about it. May is 2 months out and this thing changes daily if not hourly. Knowing ANA won’t issue me a refund since its too far out and I’m not going to wait 5 hours on hold just to have them quote something from FAQ when this isn’t a normal situation.
"""We are schuled to travel to Japan 18MAR and we are wavering only because the AH trump might restrictreturning to the US and we would be stuck. I guess we could come to Australia and visit our family and then fly home."

"Global7, Thank you for the local perspective, it’s actually made me feel a little less anxious, I was definitely getting in my own head thinking japan would be empty and everywhere would be closed like a ghost town lol. I really appreciate the insight from a local which I wouldn’t have been able to get from anywhere so I’m glad I made a comment! Hopefully things do not worsen or possibly even get better by May (less crowded trains sounds nice). Thank you so much again for to our response I feel somewhat relieved (:"
"Sky commander,Thank you for your response! I feel the same, it’s very hard to estimate and plan when it’s two months away and things are changing almost hourly to daily. I’ve been told for now to just plan like I’m going but be prepared to possibly re-scheduling the trip, still, I like to have a game plan and it’s a lot of money gone into the trip. The forum has definitely made me feel 100% less stressed though. Let’s just hope things either don’t worsen or even get better by May! I’m thinking most things should open again for golden week?"
"Shot, Thank you for your perspective, hearing that most things will look normal for me has eased my stress. Like I’ve said in other posts I just can hope that things do not worsen, otherwise I feel more confident about going. My accommodation can be cancelled a night before and if there is a travel ban my insurance will cover my flights. But until there is a ban I still am planning on 100% going (: Thank you all for your helpful posts and sorry if I didn’t respond to everyone, the insight has been very helpful and made me feel less anxious, getting info from the source is a lot better then reading Facebook posts from doomsday prepers."
"Harri, thank you for your reply.Well, it is definitely an unusual situation so checking the news like site below.https://www.japantimes.co.jp/My point of the bakery episode was to tell the Japanese are taking extra care to lessening the possibility of you from getting infectious at stores.If you go to the restaurants they spray the alcohol sanitizer to clean the tables and seats. Don't forget hygienity is the big issue now. The Japanese government warned to avoid buffets for the time being.The situation is quite fluid and unless you're sure your flight won't be cancelled, also consider the possibility of postponing."
"Australian government’s level 3 “Reconsider etc” has important relevance for travel insurance policies. It’s meant nothing is covered (general exclusions) now on my Comprehensive Cover, and I took it out in December for April travel. Had to cancel."
"Good luck with it all. I think the Asian countries are having a better grip on the situation compared to our Western fellows.We have got a trip plan for September, at this point, no plan to cancel."
"Update! Just went thru immigration. From all nations i’ve been to, this one was the QUICKEST. Just grabbed my luggage which was also super quick and now I’m off to the station. It’s a wet one out here today! Tired but not jet lagged"
"Welcome to Japan from Miami, Igor!!Too bad it is rainy today, but tomorrow wil be fine."
"My partner and I are due to go to Japan on 27th March for 2 weeks. We are quite worried about the situation and are unsure if we should go or not. I've been reading a lot on the Internet and watching lots of YouTube videos and it seems very quiet everywhere in Japan which seems good in a way but it looks too quiet. We're going to Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nara and Hiroshima. I've read that some trains might be cancelled which could affect our travel plans. Also I've seen videos of empty streets and restaurants in Kyoto which is also worrying. It would be nice with it being quiet but not empty everywhere.British Airways have announced that we could rearrange our flights for another time or destination within 12 months which is now making us think we should cancel our holiday to Japan. We are so upset about the situation and really want to go to Japan but it seems like it would be a better idea not to go. Looking to get other peoples thoughts on this?Edited: 3:57 am, March 14, 2020 "
Our trip is from 5th to 16th April and at present we will be going!
We’re going on the 15 April for a month and as all the raíl passes etc are booked we will definitely go unless the government stops us.
"Thank you, Dr. Shibuyakko, for your wise words in post #250 reminding us that we're talking about a pandemic, which scientists are predicting could kill hundreds of thousands to millions of people worldwide. Perusing this thread, I saw only one other poster who was wondering about ""the morality"" of traveling right now. That's the question that should be at the forefront of all of our minds.It's not just about you, people. It's about unknowingly contracting and then giving a deadly virus to your parents, grandparents, immune-compromised or chronically ill friends and family, neighbors, co-workers, service workers, teachers. And don't fool yourself that Covid19 won't kill you because you're young. Li Wenliang, the 34-year-old ophthalmologist who was one of the first to warn about the coronavirus in Wuhan, died from the virus last month after first suffering pneumonia, inability to breathe, sepsis, and finally organ failure. But dying is not the only worry: if infected, even if you recover you very well could end up with permanent lung damage, which will make you more susceptible to disease in the future.There is no vaccine for Covid19 and experts say there won't be one in less than a year. In the meantime, social distancing — reducing the contact rate between infected and susceptible people, making it harder for an infected to bump into a susceptible - that’s our only hope at the moment.During the deadly 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, doctors said the greatest obstacle to slowing the death rate was ""getting healthy people to take personal precautions to help protect others who are at greater risk."" That pandemic did not end well, with one-third of the world's population infected and an estimated 50,000,000 deaths.The poster who is concerned about the morality of traveling right now is spot on. Each and every one of us can help lessen the worldwide toll that Covid19 is going to take by simply staying home. The world will still be out there when this is over. Let's do what we can now to insure that we, and our loved ones and neighbors, are still around to see it."

"My partner and I are super excited about our trip to Japan from June 28 to July 8. There’s little concern about the virus. Even tiny countries like Norway, Switzerland and others have actual higher cases than Japan. When you take per capita into account Japan is way down the list. We are flying into Kyoto on United, spending 4 nights in the area, then a day/night near Lake Ashi, then finish with 4 nights in Tokyo before flying back to California. A quick trip but should be a fun one. I’ve been to Japan before, my partner has not."
"Map... if you’re flying into kyōto , you’re crashing. I think you mean Osaka. :)"
"Same! Im planning to go on 18-25 April, if you guys now in there already, please update here. Im so excited to go Japan for the first time but really concerned with this covid-19 issue."

"Many of the new cases in my country announced today are people who had travelled to various affected countries so the risk of unknowingly bringing the virus home and passing it on to other susceptible people (family members, co-workers, the elderly, those with compromised immunity or pre-existing medical conditions etc) is pretty high now. If one does not need to travel at this time, please cancel the trip. We can all do our part to minimise the global spread of this virus by not travelling overseas. Otherwise, this pandemic and resulting recession will not see an end anytime soon."
"2nd trip report: The day is super nice out. The sun is shining, LOTS AND LOTS OF people out and about, including tourists. I was one of the stressed people in the USA stressing about the trip, the media ALMOST got to me. Me and the wife are super happy that we came. They say it’s not as crowded as usual (my 1st time here) but i see a lot of people out. Again, if you are on the fence, THE TIME IS NOW TO COME. I told my wife today while walking around Meiji Shrine that I literally felt the stress melting away as i strolled by."
@Igor how is the situation with restaurant? Is the atmosphere ok? Supposed to leave this Thursday the UK... here is all weird so maybe in Japan I would feel more safe! Any news about museums re opening?
"Thanks for the update igor! I think all depend on us! If we take care of ourselves and do the hygiene, all seems fine. Safe travel everyone! Looking forward to meet you all if you are travelling on mid of april!"
We are due to fly out 29/3 to 13/4 and are in two minds. The flights do concern me though. Are you wearing masks?
"Arte P, reopening is quite limited as far as I know, Churaumi Aquarium in Okinawa and Kawaguchiko Museum.Right now, we are seriously trying to delay the spread, so I don't think you can expect reopening until April, but the Expert Panel will talk about the suggestions on March 19th."
Do you think this list will get Updated https://www.japan.travel/en/news/coronavirus/Or there is something else where to check?Thanks
"Arte P, the underline museums linked to the official pages. Some of the official pages say that they extended the closures.Make sure to check the official pages of the places you would like to visit."
"Igor, you sir are a legend.Please do keep us updated."
"I'm supposed to travel to Japan April 13... as of today, I've cancelled all my hotels but not my flight. I'm still hoping for this thing to end quickly, only if Japan, as well as the US, is on the downswing as far as new cases, will I even consider traveling, i feel to travel from a country with a growing infection rate, to another is not the responsible thing to do. I don't need to contribute to the spread or get stuck with a bill (even though I have trip insurance for medical) for being quarantined or whatever else may happen. I'm looking into rescheduling for mid Nov, but also questioning if it will be over by then. I am really bummed... Nov is 9 months away... ugh."
#334You're doing the right thing. November will come soon enough :-)Those of you selfish enough and still taking non-essential travel should all read this:https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/20…We need to fight this all together. Do your civic duty.
"Hopefully still travelling from the uk, arriving 1st June. Any indication from Japanese residents that we could be stopped from entering the country if things continue?"
"Japan might shut down/restrict entry from Europe soon. Many Japanese became positive after coming back from Europe, so if Abe is smart enough, he should do it now. June is more than 2 months away, so anything can happen between now and then."
"I was one of the first people to reply in this thread, nearly a month ago.I was still eager to go and brushed aside any concern as unlikely.Now we're canceling the whole trip which should have started this coming Thursday.It's honestly not worth it. Japan will still be there in 6 months, a year, or whenever things are safe enough for you to take part in the luxury of travel without infecting someone who is vulnerable.I've been in denial for a few weeks, constantly reading posts by other people eager to go, and I've been looking forward to this trip for over a year so it took me longer than it should have to accept canceling is the right thing. I'm ashamed of that.Please don't travel. Cancel what you can and use the coming months of staying in to save up some money to make your next Japan trip even better."
"Knight714, I was in denial too for my trip that is departing /starting in about 45 minutes from now. I should be in the lounge right now. Hopefully this will all be over in a few months and life will get back to normal."
"We have a trip scheduled to arrive in Japan May 18th..I can cancel at no cost and all hotels are cancellable too, but for now I am keeping the flight/reservations unchanged. It was a points award to Japan and one other destination, and hard to cobble those trips together just the right away.I was playing around seeing if I could get award in November/early December, but nothing really great so far.Will make the final decision ""should I stay or should I go"" towards the end of April. Things are so topsy-turvy right now, it's difficult to plan anything."
"@hfot... it all changed so quickly in the Netherlands in the last 4 days. So, yes, staying in Kyōto for my spring vacation. It still seems pretty normal here. No quarantines or lockdowns. I’m surprised my flight to Amsterdam left this morning and they wouldn’t refund my fare. Makes no sense when the country was shutdown yesterday. As for how life in Kyōto is going, Teramachi Shotengai/ Shopping Arcade was actually very crowded yesterday!? I assumed it would be dead but people are all out and about. I stayed home for a couple of days but then ventured out again. Staying home all day today. I bought cakey from a patisserie on my way home last night & am all set for the day. Stay well!"
"For those who still plan to go, assuming you aren't concerned with picking up the virus, the biggest issue is potential flight changes/cancellation and sudden enactment of quarantine measures. Remember you can't look at going into Japan only. Your home country might also impose mandatory quarantine periods when you go back. Such measures could wreck your plans.Less extreme examples than Europe are Australia and New Zealand. Just over the weekend, both countries have put in mandatory 14-day self-isolation period for *all* incoming passengers (visitors and citizens)."
"We have cancelled our early April trip as well. At the beginning of February, I was pretty convinced that we would be able to make this trip. However by the start of this thread, I still really wanted to make the trip but really didn’t want to perpetuate this problem at home or abroad - so knew that we would eventually cancel our flights even at a loss. Thankfully, our flights were within ANA’s guidelines to cancel/change without fees in their 3/6 notice, and after a week of trying to reach the agent, our tickets have finally been cancelled and just hoping to see our refund in a reasonable time. It’s bad everywhere...everyone needs to do their part to lock this virus down."
"I'm another person who has recently cancelled. I'm sad about it, but in the end I couldn't justify traveling at this time. I'm lucky enough to have been given a full refund from Qantas and my hotels were all free to cancel anyway. So I have enough $ stashed away for another trip when this crisis passes. :)"
"We have also just spent the weekend cancelling our honeymoon, we were due to leave next Saturday from the UK.To be honest we feel a huge sense of relief now we’ve done it - I was really struggling with the idea of going, it didn’t feel right when the situation in Europe is getting so much worse and my Spanish in-laws are having a scary time.We were scared to lose all our savings with this being such a big trip but we have managed to get full refunds on pretty much everything, so would definitely recommend asking if you’re wanting to cancel. AirBnb are now offering full refunds regardless of policy for travel until mid-April.Obviously being our honeymoon this was an extra special trip but we can do it next year instead - I think we will definitely be extra treating ourselves to fancier hotels and meals once we get to Japan in 2021!"
"Hannah,I think you did the right thing, and I am glad to hear you were able to recover most of the expenses. This is just not the right time to be traveling. You will not be able to enjoy a relaxing holiday under these circumstances. Like you say, you can save up more money and have better hotels and better meals when you make the trip later."
Just a note for any Canadians thinking about Japan or who are in Japan for a visit.Insurance companies in Canada are all cancelling out of country medical/travel insurance effective March 23rd. Apparently they have the right to do that when certain travel advisories are issued (which they now have been).
Someone on another Japan travel related forum just posted about their flight being cancelled (to the US) and that reply via e-mail could take up to 5 days. Now they are left scrambling. Not a nice way to end a vacation
"I've had a trip planned to depart London to Tokyo on the 22nd which I have decided to cancel in light of the current situation. I can't be bothered dealing with all the uncertainty over potential travel restrictions.My hostels and hotels were free to cancel but my flights, with Aeroflot, won't be refunded unless the borders close or the FCO advise against travel. I'm going to get my money back for my JR pass and cut my losses and wait for all of this to blow over. Hopefully travel will be back to normal in time for the next Sakura."
T-Mac - that's really frustrating. Does the airline let you rebook for different dates for free?
"Not unless the flight is disrupted or cancelled. It'll probably end with me losing what I paid for my flights, which amounts to just under £400. That is unless the FCO change their advice before the weekend and allows me to claim on my trip insurance."
"The FCO in the U.K. has officially advised against ALL non essential travel, anywhere in the world. The good news for those on the fence or wishing they could cancel is that insurance will generally pay out for this. Can’t believe how crazy it’s got!"
"Source:https:/…travel-advice-novel-coronavirus""The Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises British people against all non-essential travel worldwide. """
Looks like the UK has decided that burying their heads in the sand did not work. Frankly japan should close its borders to countries that have not taken drastic action. Hopefully actions taken here in canada are not too little too late.
"https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/03/1…'Japan has decided to ask all travelers from about 30 European countries, including Britain, France and Germany, to self-quarantine for 14 days in response to a surge in coronavirus cases there, a source with knowledge of the matter said Tuesday'"
"I have paid £1800 x 2 = £3600 (me and my husband) for our flight tomorrow. Non-refundable via one travel agency last year (so booked far in advance). And it's not incl. hotels. I booked it separately. Trying to get any reply from insurance but all the lines are so busy. That should have been our first trip to JPN.Hotels are non-ref. as well but they agreed to change the dates. At least something but which dates to be honest as none knows when it all ends. Well, I'll try to move possibly to next year.Thank you all for all the useful updates!"
This was March 6th - what are your thoughts 11 days later?
"Sadly we are no longer going. Made the decision today after much consideration. Just hope with today's announcement we can claim the flights back. Was due to fly 26th March, gutted. Good luck to anyway who is still going ahead with their travel plans"
"""What was March 6th? Am I missing something?""OP said he was still going on March 6. See post 166."
oops forgot to address this to Original Poster...I am curious if they are still going to Japan
"Australians can't any more, Cybertraveller. The Australian government banned it."
"Marisha, it will be a nightmare getting through to insurance right now I imagine, but with the new advisory most insurance policies will allow you to claim back flight/hotel costs - to whatever limit you had purchased. Read your policy closely to make sure you get the best outcome! E.g. for ours we would have had to physically cancel, if we didn’t turn up to the flight that was still going ahead we could only claim “missed departure” which was a much lower amount."

"Things just changed so rapidly. I knew I wasn't going to Japan a few weeks ago, but I was still hoping. My 2nd option was to go to hawaii, well looks like it's not going to happen anymore due to the lockdown.maybe i'll just stay home and play videogames for my 2 week vacation, read books, clean the house, watch movies. where I live, the city has been ordered to shelter in place, cant drive out of the city unless it's essential such as work."
"We just had to rebook our flight from the US as the carriers were cutting back on international flights. We still plan on going, 29 April. We will give ourselves up to 3 weeks prior to departure to make the final Go-No Go call."
"Good for you for trying to pursue your end of April trip. We’re scheduled for end of June. By far, Japan is one of the safest places in the world re the virus on a per-capita basis. Currently it is way down the list next to St Vincent and Turkey."
"#371The reason Japan seems to be one of the safest places is that it is not testing many people:""Japan is only using a sixth of its capacity to test for the new coronavirus even as it is increasing its ability to do so, government data shows, adding to concerns it is understating its outbreak and not doing enough to contain it.Nationwide capacity for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has grown to 7,500 a day, on track to reach an 8,000 a day target by the end of the month.But the number of tests conducted has been on average 1,190 a day over the past month, for a total of 32,125, according to health ministry data.And while Japanese doctors have carried out more than 32,000 tests, only 16,484 people have actually been tested, given that many are often tested multiple times.That compares with more than the 200,000 tests conducted in South Korea and the 80,000 in Italy.""https:/….XnZUdi2ZMW8We did 10,000+ tests in the US yesterday alone."
"#371 It's true we are undertesting. We're trying to avoid the medical collapse. Once they test positive, the current law requires them to be hospitalized even with the mild symptom patients. Even for them, not much can be done but wait for them to recover on their immune systems. We're one of the No.1 aging society in the world. There are waiting lists for the hospital beds even before this COVID-19. (At least 44 Americans were hospitalized from Diamond Princess. I don't know how many were discharged, but a Canadian from DP were reported to lost his life yesterday.)South Korea already have facilities to isolate the people with mild symptoms. Osaka is trying to make a system like that, but still on the way. The Japanese knows that the community spread is happening. So if you cough without wearing a mask, people will stare at you as if you were a criminal. Infections took place at some hospitals so I'm not sure if you call that ""the safest place."" After the Trump Travel ban for 30 days is over, Japan might need to raise the hurdle with the US, too."
"We raised a lot of eyebrows when we left the UK on the 18th of this month, but, other than a deserted Frankfurt airport where we transferred and a very quiet Narita all was well. Things here are quieter than usual in that there are no large bus tour groups but all restaurants and shops seem to be open as normal. A lot of paying attractions are however, closed. Bon voyage!"
"#374, I am not sure you can be sure all was well from that travel until may be 14 days has passed with no symptoms. The danger of this virus is that human beings cannot see it and nothing visible happens immediately when people got infected. (It is not like someone would fall down the minute they got infected. That would have been a helpful hint)The only advantage of an empty terminal is that people are not crowded together, so less chance for close contact.I do hope all was well for you and your family. It was just an unnecessary risk to take.In the U.S., the cases are spiking because we now have more test kits available. So we begin to see the true reality behind the earlier low case counts. State after State are taking steps to impose restrictions on people movements. You can read all about them in the news.People are giving good reviews to Dr. Emily Landon's speech she gave a couple of days ago, concerning the need and benefits of travel ban and shelter in place during this phase. She gave a straight talk that is easy to understand.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHUuWq6y8F0Edited: 5:34 am, March 22, 2020 "
"@Manisha PBut the UK government issued a non essential travel advice on the 17th?Shame on you.Edit 878peterm878 you too.Edited: 12:39 pm, March 22, 2020 "
"What a clown move Manisha P. Honestly, what were you thinking?"
"In the end, I cancelled my tickets and my hotels. It doesn't seem right for me to keep travelling when my country's CoVid-19 cases keep rising and when the number of death in my country is higher than Japan.I'm still trying to contact agoda to ask them if I could get a refund on my refundable booking. Not hoping much, but well kinda hope they could help us a bit.Hope you guys stay healthy wherever you are"
#378 Looks like the shame got to Manisha P. and the post has been deleted.Too bad we have so many ignorant and selfish people in this world.
"Thanks hfot. It's actually a tough decision for me. It supposed to be my birthday celebration and I already booked a nice non refundable ryokan in Hakone. But well, the world need all the help from us and staying at home for now seems the right thing to do for me. I live with my older family members and I don't want to accidentaly give them the virus from this trip.To all of you who still thinking about travelling, just look for your government's advice and the number of total cases. It'll help you guys to make a final decision."

"Latest for Brits abroad from the FCO:"" If you live in the UK and are currently travelling abroad, you are strongly advised to return now ,where and while there are still commercial routes available."""
"Hi, my husband is now stuck in the UK while I'm in Japan. I don't know if he will be able to come here so I wanted to ask you... Did you actually come to Japan? Could you even enter the country? How was your experience?"
"Um? What nationalities are you, Prefect MsKanji and your husband? Some Brits came before the regulations were changed before March 18 or so. Now you need to get a visa to come to Japan from the UK and soon the enry will be banned."
"We’ll despite the optimism, we didn’t make it.Best wishes to all those impacted by this terrible situation.We hope to make it a Christmas/ New Years trip now. See you then Japan."
Yeah there will be chances as far as you survive.Stay safe!!
What are chances we’ll still be able to go on our trip starting June 26? We’re from the US.
"So far very low.https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/We haven't reopened the borders towards ASEAN countries, which successfully contained it."
MAP I highly doubt Japan will open their border anytime soon to US visitors given the extremely high number of cases still ongoing in your country.
"As of May 16, the list has been expanded. Unless the number of cases and deaths drop significantly in the US, it's doubtful that tourists would be welcome. Even those of us with Permanent and Long Term Residency can't get back in once we leave and go to the countries on the ""banned"" list.. Many airlines have contacted their passengers to cancel tickets for flights in June. ""Notice from Immigration Services Agency of JapanDue to the spread of the new coronavirus infection, the target of foreigners who cannot enter Japan has been expanded. It will be as follows from midnight on May 16, 2020.1. Foreign nationals holding a Chinese passport issued at Hubei or Zhejiang of the People's Republic of China2.

"Australia is on the list and our nation-wide new cases for May 17th were just 17. USA new cases for the same day - 27,090. On a positive note I see Japan's new cases were only 48! So there is hope!"
"Just FYI, the Visa Waiver program that existed before have been suspended for the countries on the list. That means you have to go to the Japanese Embassy and apply for a visa. Technically, it's not called a ""visa,"" but rather ""invitation."" Someone in Japan has to be your sponsor. You will need to show bank accounts and transactions for the past 3 years, along with proof of having enough money during to your stay. Make sure you have enough for any medical emergencies, too. They're making it as difficult as possible, even if you have a ""real reason"" for wanting to come here. May 17, Sunday. Tokyo had 5 new cases. Osaka had 0."
