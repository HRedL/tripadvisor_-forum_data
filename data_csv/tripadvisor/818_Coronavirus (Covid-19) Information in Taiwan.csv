Can someone clarify how the home quarantine for level 3 Countries (Europe (in my case Austria) works?I plan to stay with a friend - but she prefers we book an AirBNB to stay for the 14 days. Is this okay with the rules? Or do we have to stay at her official residence? Can my friend also book it - or should I book it myself?I will be flying out in 40 hours - arriving on the 19.03...
I called 1922 - but I'm not really sure how it works - or how strict it is. You can book your own place - but you need to tell them a phone number - not sure if you can give them your own number or another one.you are not allowed to go into public spaces - that includes common areas of a hotel. Someone will visit you every day two times to check temperature and check that you did not leave your place.It's a bit hard to tell - how strict they are about common areas of a hotel. Two different people on the phone - two different opinions (short stay outside with mask allowed vs not allowed at all).

The problem is when staying at a hotel or homestay. What means not going out. Is the lobby outside or inside. The gym? How is the designated area defined. That is not answered!Is a common area public or private so to say.It is clear you cannot go out on the street! Is a garden shared with other apartments out or not. Also logically say the breakfast room of a huge hotel would be different from a homestay with only 2 apartments. But such s difference is hard to define by law.
"On March 17, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) reported that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has expanded to Asian countries outside China, with more than 10,000 confirmed cases and the number continuing to increase. Numerous countries have declared the outbreak a national emergency and introduced strict border control and quarantine measures. Recently, the epidemic situation in the United States has also escalated. Considering the increased risk of infection, the CECC announced that effective March 19, it will raise its travel notice for 19 countries in Asia, one country in Eastern Europe, and three states in the US to Level 3: Warning. This comes in addition to China (including Hong Kong and Macao), South Korea, and Central Asian countries, which are already subject to a Level 3: Warning travel notice.The countries and US states covered by this announcement are as follows:  Asia: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, East Timor, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam Eastern Europe: Moldova US states: California, New York, and WashingtonThe CECC has advised that all nonessential travel to the countries and areas listed above be avoided. Starting at 16:00, March 17, Taiwan time, travelers already on a flight from any of these countries or areas to Taiwan must observe a 14-day period of self-health management after entering Taiwan, while those boarding a flight after that time will be required to undergo a 14-day period of home quarantine. While only the above three US states have been listed at Level 3: Warning, the CECC has raised the travel notice for all other US states to Level 2: Alert. Travelers to Level 2 states are advised to take strong precautionary measures and will be required to observe a 14-day period of self-health management upon returning to Taiwan."
"There is what you mean ""The problem"". The policy has put in place for more than one month. You can ask 1922 for more details. The gov officer may not update their 3rd list simultaneously. But the details about how to quarantine is the same."
I called 1922 and the answer was different then the one they gave to my friend calling. I guess it will depend on the local officer!BTW - very difficult to book rooms/apartments as a foreigner now. Since today many places are very afraid because of the 8 new cases.

"I booked a private place - without shared space - so in case there are less restrictions on my local friends family when I arrive. Could have stayed at their family place - but separate place seems better. In Tainan ""hotela.com.tw"" is advertising that they still accept foreigner - cannot tell if they are considered an official quarantine hotel however.I do hope after quarantine explaining hotels/guesthouses that you are through it - bookings are not cancelled.Edited: 10:36 am, March 17, 2020 "
"If you stay in Tainan, you can try bnb located outside of metro area, maybe around the harbor or urban area.. That's more flexible in your life space. You can even go to kitchne, or even garden.Try to find some bnb with top single floor.Since less local people travel, bnb is easier to book if you don't have any symptom. Tell(call) the host or hotel the truth in advance. If they reject, please reject right away and you can try to find another place to ensure your accomodation.--BTW, keep your hotel in secret.Edited: 11:40 am, March 17, 2020 "
Yes I had always directly written I will use their place for 14 days quarantine in order not to arrive and be rejected (or hiding while my friend checks in for me or similar - or having her book and checkin instead of me).Didn't find many bnb on the outskirts however on the normal booking sites. Ended up with a rather central place - at least with Balcony.. If you write to enough hosts - some have no problems - just a warning that like 4 out of 5 now reject people on quarantine. Seemingly some (50%?) also reject any foreigners now.
Try airbnb like this. Some airbnb are independing building/villa. You are the only one guest. https://www.airbnb.com.tw/s/%E5%8F%B0%E5%8D%97%E5%B8%82/homes?query=%E5%8F%B0%E5%8D%97%E5%B8%82&refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&source=mc_search_bar&search_type=unknown&tab_id=home_tab&federated_search_session_id=23f1216a-c1d7-49c4-bed1-ace37491147f≠_lat=23.001977476112312≠_lng=120.19224052736922&sw_lat=22.972860475785506&sw_lng=120.15108471224471&zoom=15&search_by_map=true&checkin=2020-04-14&checkout=2020-04-23

"Thanks for consistently providing the updates Sullivan, my flight just got cancelled by China Airlines so that's the end for me.I hope Taiwan can recover soon!"
It's a bit strange that there is still no english notice. Many media announced the closure starting tomorrow - but on the CDC website it does not actually seem so. One notice in chinese mentions it - but then newer notices just announce mandatory quarantine for everyone entering now. I'm a bit confused which is correct.
"Oh damn it - there is the correct information. Departures in the next 2 hours are still okay - but no later:https://www.mofa.gov.tw/en/News_Content.aspx…Damn - I missed booking a flight 2 days earlier by 1 hours, now my flight is 1:25 after the deadline..."

"The level 3 advisory, which previously had been applied to 101 countries and territories, covering virtually all of Europe and Asia, has been extended to reflect the global spread of the coronavirus, including Latin America, Africa and Oceania, the center said.The center had already mandated a 14-day home quarantine for all travelers arriving in Taiwan and a ban on the entry of foreign nationals, with some exceptions, under tightened border controls that took effect on Thursday, minimizing the effects of the new advisories.https:/…2003733093"
"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan announced on Sunday (March 22) that airplane passengers will be banned from making transfers at the nation's airports in a bid to check the risk of coronavirus transmissions.The ban goes into effect on Tuesday (March 24) and will last through April 7, according to the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC). The measure was implemented to curtail cross-border human movement and curb the highly contagious COVID-19.Taiwan reported 16 new Wuhan virus infections on Sunday, 13 of whom were imported cases, bringing the total up to 169. The island country has seen a rise in cases over the past week, with most of them having traveled and studied abroad.https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3902193"
Is Taiwan still planning to reopen for transit airport passage after 7 April? I need to know because I'm still trying to figure out how to eventually get back to the U.S from Singapore. EVA Airlines would be a good option. Thank you very much

"Assuming that I am allowed to enter Taiwan, I will need to stay 14 days in quarantine (I'm based in Hong Kong, and I hope to be exempted from the bar on foreign nationals under ""persons requiring special permission"").Rather than stay with relatives, I would much prefer to stay in a hotel. Can anyone advise which hotels are available for those under quarantine in Taichung?"
"Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) announced that two policies regarding air travel will be extended indefinitely in order to further prevent the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).The first of the polices restricts direct flights across the Taiwan Strait; the second bans flight transfers in Taiwan's airports. The policies were originally set to expire on April 29 and April 30, respectively, according to CNA.As for when the two policies will be lifted, the CECC said that it would depend on the situation of the pandemic.https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3921712"
"Hi. Does anyone have the link to quarantine hotels in Taichung, Taoyuan and Taipei please? Thanks in advance!"
"Hi!I'm flying over on July 15th (2 week business trip which will then be extended into a vacation since there's no other way to get an international vacation without wasting it all in quarantine). I am returning on September 2nd. Who books the quarantine hotel, me or travel agents? I'll be flying into TPE but the business is in Hsinchu.Here's what i'm wondering. COVID is gone in Taiwan. Suppose COVID gets really bad in the US, as many people are predicting, as everything starts to reopen. What happens if it's too dangerous for me to return to the US as the disease is spreading like wildfire? Would the Taiwanese and US governments automatically recommend that I stay there for my own protection and extend the visa as long as necessary? 90 days would end in October so we have some leeway.The catch is we don't know how much of these business expenses after the tip the company would pay for or how long COVID will last in the US (months? Years?)Edited: 4:44 pm, June 16, 2020 "
naw they will tell you to get back to the United States.. that's what happened to me
Even if doing so is a possible death sentence if COVID is completely out of control by then?
why do you think Taiwan is responsible for you?
I suppose. Oh well

"short-term Taiwanese SIM card available in USA?Hello, Thanks to Chris T @ct71928 & KC Hsu@KaiCH91 for writing in a different thread (Transportation from TPE to Kaohsiung during COVID) that SIM cards are available for purchase by arriving passengers at Taoyuan TPE before the Covid-19/quarantine check point. However I would still like to buy, now in the USA, a 15-day SIM card for phone & data in Taiwan before I travel there in a few weeks. Will anyone please recommend a good source whose shipment I'll receive by the end of August?"
"1. What quarantine lodging is available for September?2. Travel to a city outside Taipei area for quarantine? 1. Thanks to Steve S for posting https://stay.ownrides.com/en , very helpful. Are there more sites, for instance a government site that would list all the hotels in Taipei & other cities? This site is linked to MOFA but it appears that the quarantine agreement between government & these hotels ends in August: https://taiwan.taiwanstay.net.tw/covhotel/ .2. Is it possible (& advisable or reasonable) for a non-national to travel immediately from TPE in some kind of quarantine transport (taxi or bus or train?) to the destination city, such as Tainan, then complete the quarantine there? If yes how does one arrange the transport in advance? Is there a limit to the cost of the transport?Edited: 6:43 pm, August 03, 2020 "
"Hi all,I'm planning a trip to Taiwan in early September so looking into the quarantine hotels now but finding it all a bit confusing. I've been using the approved list from the gov website to consult and look for availability but there isn't much within my budget. Does anyone have any tips? Or has anyone done their quarantine in an Airbnb or something similar? That would be great as I am travelling with a group so it would be amazing if we can quarantine together there. I've been in touch with some Airbnbs but its a bit of a mixed bag as some won't accept quarantiners. Can anyone recommend useful sites with quarantine guides and information besides the government one (i.e. written by other people who have had to do it?)Thanks!"
