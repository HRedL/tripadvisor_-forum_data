"I would like to ask you Florida residents if there is an official recommendation for international travelers to self-quarantined after entering US, as in this article, which is saying that all who have travelled internationaly should self-isolate for 14 days after returning home...https:/…Does this mean that coming from Europe ( Czech republic ), I have to go through the self-isolation too?We have air tickets for March 18th to Miami ( going then on a 3 weeks roadtrip north to KSC, Savannah, Charleston, Smokies, down to New Orleans, Pensacola, Orlando, Key West and Miami )thank you for help and comments, I am checking the situation every day and still don´t know if travel or cancel.."
I would think not if coming in from the Czech republic .From Northern Italy? Yes
"That's an incredibly heavy itinerary for only 3 weeks .. The parks in Orlando alone could take an easy 2 weeks .. same with Key West . New Orleans, Savannah and Charleston could keep you busy for a week each. The smokies for as long as you can hike .. you get the idea. As for travel … when is this supposed to happen? Nobody can foresee how this situation will develop"
"We should arrive on March 18th..I know that noone can see what is gonna happen in a week, I wanted to know if there is really a self-isolation ordered/recommended for foreign visitors coming to US, as stated in the article..I can not find the info on our Czech ministry website, so wanted to get the info directly from the place..In this case we would cancel the trip..Edited: 4:36 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"You are trying to do too much, so i would cut down your itinerary incl Charleston, savannah, NOLA and Pensacola. Too much driving, not enough time in each place."
"I am sorry - and thank you for your comments regarding the itinerary - but at this moment we are worried about the possible entering to US at first ( without the must to stay self-isolation ) , not the itinerary itself..Edited: 11:25 am, March 10, 2020 "
There are no required self quarantine requirements for arriving passengers.I would monitor this closely as things can change.
"As stated above, procedures can change, but here some links that might be helpful.https:/…""If any arriving flights at MIA include a passenger who has traveled to China or Iran within the last 14 days, or include a passenger who has had contact with someone confirmed with COVID-19 within the past 14 days and is showing related symptoms, the CBP will notify the CDC that the passenger requires additional screening by the CDC quarantine station at MIA for COVID-19.""CDC linkhttps:/…summary.htmlMiami-Dade County linkhttps:/…home.page"
We told you already that you are not restricted at this time.But you are still not listening to us. please do so.
"Hana, In case you have not heard, President Trump has banned people coming from Schengen Area countries, beginning midnight, March 13 and continuing for 30 days.Edited: 10:49 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Donna, thank you for the info, I have read the info right in the morning :( Very sad, as we were looking forward to the trip so much..Hopefully this will be over soon and everyone will be safe."
