"Hi, I am Lorna. We are schedule to have a trip in Malaysia this coming March 4 to 7 but due to theNCOV affecting Asia and other countries can we rebook the flight maybe on May or June this year? Without charges and penalties? As much as possible we do not like to rebook but because of this emergency case which is the health concern of everybody we are force to. thank you. We hope to get a positive result from the airline."
Have you contacted the airline?
"As long as your flight is scheduled normally, changes of travel date will fall under the normal change conditions of your fare rules.Contact your airline."
"Hi Lorna. I understand your concern at this time, but no one here can give you an answer. It depends on the airline, so you do need to ask them what their current position is on flights at the beginning of March."
"As far as I am aware there are no current Travel Advisories against travel to Malaysia. So - unless you are transiting in China - you don't get a free rebooking unless the Terms and Conditions of the fare you purchased allow it. Of course, if the virus is not contained successfully it could be a different situation by early March."
"I don't have particularly high hopes that you will get what you want, Lorna, but it doesn't hurt to ask.As wirewiper says, your chances are higher if you have to transit China."
Let us know what your airline says when you ask them to change your flight booking for free
"PSS,There have been US people worried about travel to Australia, not via Asia, and even one classic post from a mother worried about her 15yo daughter flying Newark NJ to Raleigh NC."
