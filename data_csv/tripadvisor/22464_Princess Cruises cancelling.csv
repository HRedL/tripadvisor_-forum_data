Princess Cruise lines cancelling cruises for 60 days. What will be the effect for GC?
Less chance of people getting infected with the coronavirus probably.
Disney is suspending all cruises too. Wouldn't be surprised if others follow.There is no doubt that this will have a major effect on the tourist industry on this (and all other) islands. This will be further magnified if and when more travel restrictions are put into place.
