Looking forward to seeing the science behind this!Remember follow the science.
"The science is the recent and current higher infection rate per 100,000 of population in Portugal compared to the UK.Portugals rate is increasing the UKs declining."
"A huge blow for Portugal's tourism industry. Quite honestly compared to some others that have made the list, this is unjustified imo."
Never mind the sciencelRemember and adhere to the 14 day quarantine JH on your return.
Mind your own business Willy
"Terry- Portugal deaths 1500England 43,000Makes perfect sense yes?!!!"

"Love korma and thanks for taking the time out your hectic schedule to check my reviews.Remember tho,14 day quarantine on return.Enjoy!"
"James it has nothing to do with death rates.The reasons for The decision have been known and discussed some time..Anyone who wants to come to Portugal , without insurance cover and quarantine on their return to the UK will be welcomed.That is the decision individuals and families have to make...I don,t agree with the English government but equally I do not think that Portugal should lift f any of the current restrictions for at least another 6months..."
"The lunacy of this decision is that if for example you stay in Ayamonte (Spain) and drive for 20 minutes across the border to visit Castro Marim in Portugal, you have to declare this to someone (who?) and quarantine for 2 weeks? Ditto in the border area between Spain and Portugal in the far north. An unrealistic and ill thought out decision imo. Simon Calder speaking just now on the radio said much the same thing."
"Craig, @7 some debut post! This is a family friendly forum, you can tell by all the childish posts. James Harvey, if you find Travel Insurance to cover against FCO advice, good luck to you, if not please make that donation to the Albufeira Bomberios."
"Germans, French, Dutch etc think it's safe here. But this ruling will be disaster for the Algarve tourist business with the free spending English not coming in numbers. Let's hope things will change in time for the September and October 'adult' groups.Unlucky England, unless like some friends of mine who will now drive all the way. After all, they will be returning from France.In my opinion many of the restrictions on personal and public life are going to become permanent. Not just because of this particular situation, but ready for the next one and the one after that, ad infinitum.No-one will be allowed to even have a common cold without being isolated from the populace as a whole."
"Overall deaths not really relevant. It is all about new infections per 100,000, which is higher in Portugal than the UK. Having said that, Serbia is on the UK's list but the infection rate there is very much higher. Something not right"
Excellent choice for the donation @ algarveaddict
How many million Brits holiday in Serbia compared to those who in past years came to Portugal.
Serbia could be the next must go to destination
#15 Thanks William.
Yes we as a family were due in Lagos on 20 July but won't be going now. We certainly wouldn't ignore FCO advice nor would we travel without travel insurance. It is a public forum and JH is potentially disappointed - we need to relax and respect other people's views. Terry R is someone who's posts are worth taking on board. Hopefully we'll be back in Portugal soon? Take care everyone.
"People are missing the point , travel without insurance, then if the hotel you are staying in gets an outbreak and get locked down for 14 days, the government of UK or Portugal will not pay for your extra accomodation and flights home. Also, people who ignore the FCO, with probbaly also ignore social distancing rules too, due to their nature and put everyone at risk. Just everyone try to stay safe please, if you had lost someone to Covid you might have a different view on matters.JH - is obviously immune as he keeps banging about being 7ft tall, 20 stone and ex SAS or whatever.Edited: 2:37 pm, July 03, 2020 "
"The BBC are now telling us we have to self isolate in Albufeira for two weeks, I don't mind Quarantine in England but in Portugal would be a deal breaker! Booking already confirmed for 7 days from 8th August however no point if we are locked in!!"
"From tonight’s World stats.Cases per 1m populationSpain 6,366Belgium 5,326Gibraltar 5,283Ireland 5,164UAE 5,002Djibouti 4,793Russia 4,577Maldives 4,459Moldova 4,325Portugal 4,196UK 4,187I am still struggling to understand why Spain and not Portugal? Any explanation out there please?"
"""Also, people who ignore the FCO, with probbaly also ignore social distancing rules too...""An assumption, probably!"
"#22 I'm not taking sides but take a look at the 7 day rolling average, completely different between the two.Edited: 3:42 pm, July 03, 2020 "
24.Also how ma y on that list are very popular tourist destinations with an increase in their infection rate .
"Either there are clear and transparent criteria for these decisions that we can all understand, or not. So far we have discounted death rates and said it is down to cases per 1m population. Now it might be some other measure?Parts of Spain like Asturias are doing remarkably well, others like Malaga, Palma in Mallorca and Ibiza are reporting worrying spikes. This is just as tourists are arriving in their 1000s. Crazy."
"To be honest it’s pretty much like everything else the UK government have done during the pandemic, completely nonsensical."
"Agree Nick. I missed out the worrying upsurge in cases in Lleida. From rtve.es news just now:The Generalitat's Emergency Medical System (SEM) has installed a field hospital, made up of three independent modules, next to the Arnau University Hospital in Vilanova de Lleida, which has seen how the number of people who have entered with COVID-19 is It has tripled in the last ten days .Edited: 4:14 pm, July 03, 2020 "

"The only effective `measure` of Corona Virus is the current `rate` of infection per 1000 ... in which case Algarve .. it has spread throughout the region .. is twelve times higher than the current rate in Scotland. Allowing northern Portuguese to travel south was just plain lunacy. It means that all the precautions being taken by airlines and airports are completely invalid ... you step out of Faro and meet an infected person, possibly .. who might even have come in from Spain. People will travel, but I would strongly advise sticking to the lockdown rules on washing, masks, hand sanitiser and social-distacing of at least 6 feet ... the penalty for stupidity could be .. death. And dont look at the mortality rate for Algarvians ... look at the rate for careless ( or elderly) foreigners."
"Prymans is correct viewing just the figures.If the UK had seen the same proportional rise in cases as Portugal , no pubs, restaurants Tec would be opening today..What Costa should do is make it crystal clear that the current regulations should stay in place idefinetely.If they are still operating stop all flights from Brazil and of the other Portuguese speaking nations with high Covid rates.A UK government minister has said that the decidion was made on scientific grounds.The Algarve is not an island it is just part of Portugal."
"Thank you Terry ... there are no new infections recently in Ayrshire, but there could be if people from England are allowed to come here on holiday ... same situation as in Portugal ... no-one can afford to bury their heads in sand .. or government propaganda ... when lives are at stake. But there is much more at stake for people who came here and get an infection, because they will not be allowed to leave until they are clear and that could cost thousands of euros, not covered by insurance. It is the only possible validity for thermal cameras at Faro airport ... since they cannot protect us once we land here ..."
Im guessing this will be revised soon. There's always the land border solution via Spain for frustrated Brits.
"Sadly over 400new infections in Portugal today, an increase from yesterday."
"I guess that in the declining months of our ""transition period"" Brits will still be treated by the Portugese heath service, provided they have an EHIC. But most insurers won't cover any Covid related expenses - hotel expenses for partners etc, new flights, repatriation of the body."
"While I would be happy using the EHIC in an emergency in the Spanish state system, I would warn against it in Portugal. Portugal has a hybrid co-payment system of state healthcare and facilities are pretty basic on the Algarve, outside of the private clinics. Terry can probably provide more in depth info on what is and isn’t available as he is a resident.Edited: 2:32 pm, July 04, 2020 "
"today 413 new cases two days ago 328, what come Monday as weekend figures are usually low, If you were on holiday in albufeira and felt symptoms would you know where to go? is there clear instructions in hotels? not going just curious...thanks"
R rate will increase in England for certain. Been to a couple of pubs earlier. Social distancing in non existent. The queues outside pubs/bars is chaos with under 30’s who have had it hard socially in lockdown.
"The majority of residents certainly those we know rely on private health cover.The Portuguese A& E system is overstretched to say the least.Many horror stories just as bad or worse than any you will hear in the UK.Nothing is free , cost may be low but certainly not free.Would I travel without insurance relying just on my EH1C form, no If would not ..Ask yourself why there are so many private hospitals and clinics in the Algarve."
"well said Terry R . I won't knock the Portuguese health service as used it many times for minor infractions, but my last unfortunate problem 2 yrs ago was not good . I disslocated my shoulder with a trip up a step going into hotel. Went to Centro Saude who transferred me to Faro Hospital. Tney pulled it out with no sedation whatsoever, it was horrendous (worse than giving birth as a women ). Apparently from what they told me they dont sedate when doing this, unlike the UK NHS do. They then put me in a sling which I had to pay €50 for and then said contact your local hospital when you get home . On arriving home I needed an operation to correct it. BTW covered by my EHIC card, but had travel insurance as a back upEdited: 8:08 pm, July 04, 2020 "
"Thank you JaylanThe last thing the overstretched Portuguese health system, already coping with Covid is hordes of uninsured tourists relying just on their EHIC cards.. The health centres if they are not in a serious life threatening condition should point them towards the nearest private clinic."
"Jayjan do you have a list of private clinics in Albufeira area or a link to where to find them please, just in case of being needed (hopefully not!) Staying S/C in apt and not sure if accommodation will have this info. Keeping all crossed for change of FCO advise for Sept."
"blue259, There is an International Health Centre at the bottom end of the strip, just over the road from Wild & Co Bar. This is their website https://internationalhealthcentres.com/en/ Not sure of any others, maybe another member can comment"
much appreciated.
"#24 Algarveaddict""I'm not taking sides but take a look at the 7 day rolling average, completely different between the two.""I'm struggling to understand exactly what figures are being used as the basis for the UK's decision. Can someone please explain which of the figures I should be looking at from the attached?https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Edited: 11:15 am, July 05, 2020 "
PaulAlgarveaddict is correct in saying that it’s the 7 day rolling average figures as opposed to the daily figures that folk should be looking at as it gives a much clearer indication of spikes etc.As for Boris - whack-a-mole
Compared to the UK population over 60 million Portugals figures are much higher.It could be that the UK has looked at Portugals overstretched medical system and decidec tjat it could not cope with a msjor outbreak with posdibly 100 thousand plus Brits on holiday here who would then require evacuating with the risk of them introducing the virus back into where they live.We will probably never be told.
"I have seen a lot of people say that the figures being looked at is the cases per 100k of the population. Portugal's current figure is 4,305. I have a few countries which made the list who have a higher infection rate - Belgium – 5,335, Iceland – 5,450, Ireland – 5,166, Spain – 6,366, Singapore – 7,657. Also, another country which made the list was Serbia. Their new daily cases are very much on a par with Portugal and their population is almost 2 million less.Edited: 1:03 pm, July 05, 2020 "
"Once again, you need to look at trends , the last few weeks in Portugal.Also since when did Serbia and Iceland welcome millions of tourists.It's all in the figures if you interpret them correctly.."
"Paul, beneath the charts is a facility to select both 3 day/7 day rolling average.This gives a much better picture of the current trend.https:/…"
"by the looks of it Portugal had a very good May and June has not been so kind, but this green amber red system could change every 7 days all over Europe it will be like the changing of lights and unmanageable people booking flights one week cancelled the next, personally I think Portugal has dodged a bullet what they don't need is an influx of tourists and if they can just soften the blow with other European countries coming in then lets hope they don't break the hospital system and the spirit of the local people...."
"Thanks Algarveaddict. It looks as if Portugal are being punished for getting things under control in May, which makes the June figures look comparatively worse. I can see that the trend is slightly upwards, but not to an alarming extent. But maybe the last thing the Algarve needs is a whole load of Brits abroad giving it loads of welly."
"I feel for my Portuguese friends who have restaurant and bars , they have sacrificed an awful lot to find that they are deemed in the red zone by Boris . Yet it’s still ok to fly to Spain ........ https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-848…"
"Paul has a very valid point, being the best in the class then being punished on exam day just because you are sick doesn't mean you are a failure, the Algarve should rise above the Brits and offer continental breakfasts and no fry;s!!! I jest of course as the common man wants to holiday there but the powers that be who wanted out of Europe to make up their own rules are doing just that one rule for them(boris dad being in Greece, farage in America, boris, dominic, matt, and Michael gove all rule breakers the Toffs are ruling with an iron fist....."
"The way our Covidiots behaved when the pubs reopened, I'd agree that the last thing the Algarve (and Portugal) need is hoards of British tourists............so ashamed to be British."
"The vast majority of the 'Covidiots' mentioned in post 57 were young kids - mainly under 25 from what I could see in the pictures. It's a bit harsh to tar all British people with the same brush and especially the demographic who travel to Portugal - in the main families and couples of all ages. I know Albufeira and PdR get lots of younger, single tourists, but the overall majority do not behave like that.For what it's worth I believe the first day of the pubs re-opening was always going to be like that, regardless of when it happened.Don't be so quick to brand all of your fellow countrymen based on the behaviour of a relatively small minority of young people."
"#57....Really starting to feel that way myself , horrendous videos doing the rounds . I just feel so sorry for businesses in the Algarve . Generally it’s not a destination for the idiots though. They also deal with situations different to our police.Edited: 5:21 am, July 06, 2020 "
Please excuse my rant ! Just watched a video of police being attacked by a large mob in a London housing estate after trying to break up a large party . I’ve calmed down now. Appreciate what you are saying El en Hills . Yes it’s the minority Who ruin it fo ether rest of us. Hopefully tourists can start to visit Algarve soon .
"We have our share of Covidiots in Ireland, too. There was a massive crowd with no semblance of social distancing in Dame Lane in Dublin City centre on Saturday night.We finally have a new government here (almost 5 months after the general election) and one of the first things they announced was a continuation until at least July 20th of the 14 days quarantine requirement for people arriving in Ireland from abroad. We have flights to Faro next Sunday (July 12th) and it looks as if we might have to cancel. Waiting to see how Ryanair response to this latest announcement."
"Paul, Ryanair's response will be to fly as that way they don't have to refund anyone, as long as Portugal will except tourists then Ryanair says"" Your wish is my command"""
Airlines across Europe will fly you to Portugal as there is no law against it. It's not their business what might happen to you when you fly back.Travel insurance should be checked. If any government advises against 'non-essential' travel to a country your travel insurance could be void.Meanwhile it is 32º outside my back door and I have had my head under the sink trying to find a leak!
"Whilst I'd normally agree El-n-Hills, I think you'll find a vast majority of those families and older couples are just not ready to travel. The ones who couldn't care less about social distancing, washing their hands every 5 mins or acting responsibly, are the ones that were in the pubs, happy to share their germs around. They are currently planning to use their superhuman, can't catch Covid, armour to travel to Spain etc. where they will happily celebrate their right to infect others! Quite honestly, I think Portugal is better off without them."
"While I would prefer to go ahead with my planned trip to Alvor, I don't want to be seen to be recklessly disregarding government advice. The fact that I think that this advice is somewhat over the top is neither here nor there!I went onto the Ryanair website to see how much it would cost to change our flights to this time next year. The fare difference is not too bad - €94 in total (or €60 in total if we go for a slightly less convenient flight), but there are change fees of €180 in total, bringing the total cost to €274. The fact that they are continuing to impose such fees in the current circumstances is deplorable, but not entirely unexpected."
"Ryan air wont cancel I'm going with them on the 10th, just depends how many bookings they took for the original flight. If they go about 60 to 70% they will fly. Most people with a cheap flight will chalk balls on it and just let the ticket go and not turn up as swapping it over is such a pain and costly, having to book another entire holiday around a budget flight to reschedule it at a fair cost nearly the same price as the original price is more hassle than its worth. For one you could re book to another place , change dates etc etc and literally that place could have an out break the weeks before you go and it goes into red and you are in the exact same position as before and more money into another holiday. For that reason i Predict flight going to countries especially from crap house companies like Ryan Air and Easy Jet will go ahead and be literally half full maybe less. They know that too and that is why they have organised business model around the current situation to still get peoples money and these companies will not go bust and actually make reasonable profit too. The airlines and companies more associated with good customer service will work in more ethical ways and give genuine options to customers to help them and structure another holiday or refund them a lot easier. The irony with that is they have a fair chance of going out of business in the crazy situation!"
"Anthony, I agree with all the above points. In our case, there are two factors that would lead to us favouring the option of rescheduling.Firstly, we have an apartment in Alvor and the question of accommodation costs therefore does not arise. Secondly, the flights were relatively expensive, so we are reluctant to walk away from these costs. Having said that, I’ve read my travel insurance documents and it appears that, because the Dept of Foreign Affairs has advised against all but essential travel, a) we won’t be covered if we do travel and (b) we will be entitled to reimbursement of any non recoverable travel and accommodation expenses if we cancel."
"Sheffield Police today congratulated people for the way they behaved and respected social distancing on 'Super Saturday' as quoted in the Sheffield Star Newspaper - not bad for a population of 730,000. If holidaying in the Algarve along with my family, we would adhere to the rules, as the vast majority of Brits and Irish do. Every country has a small minority who make you cringe."
"Wait for the next heatwave in the UK, it will be a very different matter.It was raining in Bristol and they were still dancing in the streets."
"Terry, they could have been social distance dancing though :-). I'm just lucky where I live in the UK right on the outskirts of a big town, we are quiet, even our local Marstons pub/restaurant up the road from us, customers were adhering to the safe distancing rules when I passed it on Saturday. Luckily they have a big outside area too which is a bonus."
"'Super Saturday' was built up by the tabloids to be Armageddon, it wasn't. It may have something to do with no nightclubs being open etc. Not all Pubs/Restaurants are open yet either. My local Pub isn't opening and the owner has another 2 Pubs that are staying closed, he is lucky to be in a strong financial position, unlike many other businesses."
"Sure was JHKR, I get sick of all these pictures showing Brits being stupid, and same in many other countries too, so not just us. Makes me wonder how much of it is true or just media hype to scare folks. Even online papers are now asking you to subcribe to them to read their online fake news. I think not, they can sod off.Edited: 6:46 pm, July 06, 2020 "
"I was in Sheffield Saturday and it was fine, no trouble and Police and door staff kept things ticking over ok. It was a good day and evening for a few drinksEdited: 6:58 pm, July 06, 2020 "
"Jayjan, Anthony, spot on. I have witnessed trouble in Porto years ago between Spanish and Portuguese (groups of young men) - Aussies brawling with each other on a Saturday night in Melbourne, it is a worldwide problem, and has been happening for many a year; anti social behaviour isn't unique to the the UK as some people/papers would have you believe, constantly knocking the UK. As the rain comes down again, I wouldn't mind being in the Algarve now sipping a Sagres."
"When I was a lad, young men brawled outside pubs. They still do and it wouldn't even get a mention in times before.Having seen the weather in much of the UK this past few days, it may be worth 14 days in quarantine to come here for sunshine and 30º+. Plenty of space for everyone.As I write the thermometer has just flipped over to 31º outside my back door in the shade, but is is mysteriously cloudy.Edited: 5:39 am, July 07, 2020 "
"When you were a lad, pubs closed at 11.00pm on Saturday nights not the early hours.The city centres were not given over to the drinking culture at night. Banks were banks not nightclubs. Old docklands were derelict areas now entertainment centres based on bars, clubs restaurants. Its a different world. Just how many who post on here go into Bristol, Cardiff, Newcastle, in fact any city centre at night into the early hours.The expectation when the young arrive here on holiday is the same experience they have every weekend for the other 50 weeks of the year, minus the rain and cold.Edited: 5:48 am, July 07, 2020 "
"Early hours of the morning for me in a City Centre is picking family up. Temperature sounds spot on, sat in the shade reading. 15c here, the rain has just stopped. Quarantine after coming back from Portugal isn't an issue for me as I can work from home, travelling against FCO advice (essential travel only) is the problem as our insurance is null and void."
"“ Just how many who post on here go into Bristol, Cardiff, Newcastle, in fact any city centre at night into the early hours.“I do!I drop in maybe once a month to see a friend who runs the biggest arts/entertainment/ club venue in Glasgow and am also out twice a month at a casino as I play a lot of poker. While late opening has been about for roughly 30yrs now I do see a massive change in how the younger ones conduct themselves now as to when I was a bit more youthful. I would not like to be a youth growing up in today’s world."
"One thing that is different is that when I was young (and that's a long time ago) there were a lot more pubs and they all closed at the same time. We all spilled out into the streets at ten past eleven to walk home if we weren't going to a card game in the nearby Chinese restaurant. (Bandits they were!)There was usually someone in the street who wanted to pick a fight, even in leafy suburban Kent.Now it's 2am closing or later, then Uber to get home. Same on holiday of course.I sympathise with JHKR and others who are able to travel despite quarantine, but dare not because of the insurance situation. There are around 40 flights into Faro today. A friend in Denmark has pointed out that they are not permitted to fly from Portugal into Denmark. In fact there are no flights to Faro from any of the cold Scandinavian regions at all. Travel problems are not confined to the British and Irish."
"We have seen lockdowns in parts of Spain, in Australia, Sweden is tightening up rules of social distancing..The virus will not go away and mass "" party "" tourism is a Petrie dish of Covid virus..What may be good for parts of Albufeira is not good news for the rest of Albufeira and the Algarve tourist industry...Make the Algarve less attractive for that market and focus on the family market and a really safe holiday destination.."
"75, Cubsur,There was , is a big fire burning towards Messiness near San Marcos.You could see the smoke haze to the north last night."
You may be more than correct Terry ... this recently posted on Albufeira.com forumhttps:/…
That is a hard report to follow. Its it just badly written or has it been rushed through an automatic translator?
Will not apply to Brits.
"Just to follow up on my post #67 above, I got confirmation today that my claim has been accepted.Unfortunately, there is an excess of €75 per person, so I'm €150 out of pocket. But it's a lot better than the €400 plus I would have lost if my insurance cover didn't apply. And it's less than the €180 change fee it would have cost me to change to another flight (which I would prefer not to do anyway because of uncertainty about what conditions might be like next year)."
"Just seen this, https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-cor…"
It came up on one of my news feeds.If true then the virus may not be killed by below zero temps. Tough little b******
"#87, this is exactly the thought in New Zealand regarding the latest outbreak.""Americold is set to undergo testing for COVID-19 amid fears the virus survived on refrigerated freight sent from overseas and then spread to staff."""
"278 cases yesterday, 325 today in Portugal..There is no reason at all for the UK to ease its restrictions on travel.Expect to see the list of countries where quarantine applies increased not reduced.Politics has nothing to do with it."
What happened to James Harvey the OP of this thread.....I guess he is MIA!
Post 90 As was predicted earlier this week France plus Holland and Malta noe added to the UK quarantine list.Is there anyone who really does believe Portugal will be removed from the list.
"Terry R, I don't due to current situation with figures and I think the figures will rise. Heard earlier from folks who live on Algarve , loads of Northern Portuguese, Spanish & French etc not adhering to regulations ( social distancing). I can see the figures rising as they have been slowly doing over August months. Just my opinion.Edited: 5:23 pm, August 13, 2020 "
"I think it will not be long before UK closes its borders completely. Might just as well.Where I am currently in France there is much more mask wearing than in Portugal (in some cities and towns it is compulsory) but the other night in a bar watching the PSG game there was no space to be had. Large grouops of friends were sitting together at the same table. It does strike me as faintly absurd that a group of six or eight must wear masks when walking along the street, but can then dispense with them for two hours while sitting side by side."

But at least I can spell.
"Maybe that was meant to say ""you are a complete aerosol"""
lol i was going to say that but didnt know how to spell it.....reported it anyway
The Portuguese government has extended the restrictions in Lisbon until the end of August.It would not be doing this if it really did think thst the virus was in decline.
Mr 'aerosol' was reported. P.A.
"Can anyone explain to me please, the data coming from DGS? I know that, the way numbers were counted, changed back in May, but what exactly is 'Suspected' cases? At first I thought it was just the number of those being tested, with either a negative or positive result but obviously not. So are the numbers being shown as positive, just those being tested in hospitals and the 'Suspected' are elsewhere, care homes, mild/stay at homes etc. Thank you"
"There is a big `track and trace` effort in Portugal from day 1 ... so `suspeitos`will be all those tested, inc family and contacts of those with the virus .. though it doesnt explain the 1.8 million `samples` (amostras) very well. In most cases, they self-isolate at home, some foreign workers under police guard in Albufeira, etc .. only serious cases will go the hospital (the worst place to send them) ..I have just done a tally of todays figures ... 24 weeks of pandemic, 363 cases in first 12 weeks for Algarve, butnow 612 cases in the latter 12 weeks .. av.51, equivalent to over 650 new cases per week in Scotland .."
"Thanks pyrman, the numbers just don't seem to add up, the number of Positive 54k Recovered 40k. 'Contacts by Health Authorities' almost 36k.Total number of tests 1.8m What is Total Unconfirmed Cases? Is this just a bad Google translation, is it possibly a 'Negative' result? It's such a high number."
