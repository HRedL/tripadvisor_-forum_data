"I am curious. We'll be there in 10 days. How does the Majestic Colonial go from being a great resort to ""Gastronomic Hell"" (recent reviews)? The Elegance next door has none of these ""stomach issue"" reviews. I am sure the produce, much of the food stuffs, bottled waterand cleaning and sanitizing products are provided by the same suppliers. I'd venture a guess that the senior management team in the DR or Spain control both ventures and I'd assume successes at one location would be adopted by the other. Questions: 1. What is going on at the Colonial? Why all the recent stomach issuereviews? 2. Are tourists bringing their flu bugs and viruses in? If so, why aren't other resorts reporting similar situations. Surely all these guests can't be making these stories up?2. Are preparation and cooking standards so much different at the Colonial vs. the Elegance?3. Are health standards really that different at these 2 resorts?4. Would staff cleaning and sanitizing procedures vary that much between the two hotels? The Colonial and Elegance appear to receive as many TA reviews as any resort in PC. Why? They are among the most popular hotels in the DR. I'm baffled with this situation. We've had a great time, and we hope to have another great time at the Majestic Colonial. Any comments, solutions or recommendations would be appreciated. JW"
Please let me know your stay was great and these are all from the same group of people! :) We will be there the week after!
"You make a lot of good points JW. I haven't been reading the ME reviews but you would think if the problem was the food or water we would hear about it from both resorts. It was pointed out on another thread that all of the reviews could have been from the same group and maybe they passed something to each other. I will also be at MC at the end of the month too and while reading the reviews have made me cautious I am trying not to worry too much. I plan to use hand sanitizer, be careful to use the bottled water, bring along some meds and cross my fingers I stay healthy. Maybe someone with a little more PC experience has a good answer to help us all relax before a vacations."
"Remember it is flu season. That,s been mentioned on a few posts. People are bringing it down with them. Like laurad262 said lets keep our fingers crossed. We will also be at the MC at the end of the month. Hopefully everything will be okay by then...."
"we will also be at MC at the end of the month and I am trying not to stress out. We have actually taken Dukoral for the first time, never been that concerned before. One of the reviews is dated jan.2011, wonder if that is a typo and they meant 2012. Hopefully management is listening to guests and reading reviews so that if it is from lack of purified water or cleanliness, they take steps to address it."
"Hello ""105"". I read the thread concerning stomach illness in PC a few days ago. We too have prepared with a shot & meds. I guess my question concerns the specific problems at the MC. Yes I saw a few ""tummy"" reviews at the Royal Catalonia. Another guest at the Iberostar Grand went into great detail about his families' holiday stomach problems and the involved costs.My concern: Read the last dozen or so reviews at the MC - it sounds serious. If these Colonial reports are true (and I am not convinced they are) why wouldn't the resort make a statement. Yes, a statement would draw attention to the resort and the issue. But it would also clean the slate. Who in their right mind would pay thousands of dollars to spend a good portion of their vacation ""praying at the porcelain alter"". There is more to this."
"The shots and the meds will not protect you if it is just plain and simple Noro type virus . . . that people bring with them. . . from points far and wideIf you consider the numbers though, 5 or 6 reviews out of how many guests there that week?? And yes, I understand that not everyone uses or posts their experience here . . . In Ontario and much of the US eastern area there is currently a LOT of Norwalk-type illness being reported. Can't comment on European countries, except for France which declared yesterday that their numbers were very high for the same illness these past two weeks.Tis the season . . . wash your hands, wash your hands wash your hands Bugs"
"Thanks, but if you take time to read the reviews on the MC each reviewer was talking about parties of say 10 - and 7 fell ill or a wedding part of 30 or so - and the majority were ""shut down for 2 or 3 days ..................Please view the reviews they make it appear to be an epidemic. I don't believe it."
"JohnnyWeston - it seems to me that large groups travelling together would be the most susceptible to a Noro outbreak. They would all meet together prior to boarding the plane, fly down together and vacation together. It would only take one of them being infected to infect a large portion of the group. Easier it seems to blame the resort than one of their friends or family.There has been lots of reported Noro outbreaks in our area already in Jan, my guess is someone brought it with them and infected who they were travelling with."
"I just got back from the MC yesterday and I can confirm that there were alot of people sick with diarrhea. I spoke to several different families. On the last day of my vacation, the MC finally brought out the hand sanitizer as you walked into the restaurants. One big problem that I noticed is that the women's washrooms rarely ever had soap. Hubby said the men's rooms were fine. I estimate that 70% of the time, I went to wash my hands and the dispenser was empty."
"Went last year to Grand Palladium. The hand sanitzers were out at all restaurants all week. As someone has already posted...... Wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands........... and you will be fine !!!! All 4 of us were fine.Totally enjoyed our vacation."
"Good to know Cari L. I'll bring little bottles of sanitizer and wipes. I'd rather be over cautious than spend my holiday not being able to leave the room (been there before and not going back).Johnny W. is right though, you'd think the hotel would be all over the bad reviews and addressing it. It can't be good for business having that many bad reviews, norwalk or not."
"That's a lot of why questions. Really who would know the answers. Half the staff at my office are sick with stomach issues due to the flu. These things just happen and we have no control over the situation. I don't see any reason for management to address the issue. Why doesn't the Bahia or Iberostar address crappy reviews?100's of guests stay at the MC every week and only a few post reviews. The ones who do post reviews usually have nothing nice to say about the resort. Next week it will be about stomach issues at the Elegance.My friends and I will be at the MC next week and it will be our 5th year in a row. Using hand sanitizer is a no brainer. We always use sanitzer wipes as I've seen people scratch their butts and other body parts at the buffet prior to taking their food. Enjoy your stay and quit worrying about the negative reviews. The MC is a fantastic resort that has great food, wonderful staff, and a beautiful beach.Perhaps we'll run into you next week and we'll have a couple of beers together. Have a great vacation!"
I had all of the same questions after reading all of the numerous negative reviews and ended up switching our reservations to the Elegance for March. Was just too freaked out to risk it for the price we were paying for the 6 of us! Now I think I will just quit reading reviews until we leave!!
"as bugs my fave infection control person on the forum said ""wash your hands"" I have seen people adjust themselves prior to going into the buffet ect, we use hand sanitizer before eating after touching the serving spoons in a buffet line. We travel to the Grand Palladium properties and they have been doling out hand sanitizer in all of their restaurants and buffets for at least 2 years"
"Some happy to see they have brought out the hand sanitizers. We'll be there for our third visit in 12 days. In 18 trips to Punta Cana, we have never been sick. Having said that, I do not believe for one second that all the recent posts are lies. Something is going on and I'm starting to get nervous. I have Chron's disease therefore adding this sickness would make my life a living hell. We definitely are taking all precautions but still uneasy."
"I don't understand how soap dispensers don't get refilled!! Rinsing hands under water wouldn't kill germs if there was a bug going thru that resort during the holidays. And, Colonial & Elegance do share some facilities so if it was a bug, I am just waiting for those reviews to start pouring in about illness on that side. Nothing yet, just sayin....I will bring my own hand sanitizer but I will not bring my own soap!! That's a given!!"
"I have taken and used hand sanitizer in the past, just never had to be OCD about it. It appears to be a big issue among recent guests as it went from hardly any comments about being sick to lots. and I do think managment has a responsibility to look into, different country or not. Most of these resorts are owned by foreign corporations anyhow and would never get away with severe gastro outbreaks in NA or Europe hotels."
I contacted the Majestic Colonial to ask should my wife and I be concerned about the recent reviews regarding stomach illness at the resort. I also requested any advice or recommendations to avoid possible GI. No response yet.
let us know what they say
"Ditto to that, Johnny. Please let us know."
"Could have been a bug. Also there have historically been a lot of stomach issues at both of these resorts. Just so happens this time it was just the one resort, maybe the others aren't comfortable posting about their movements. I got sick at ME for one night, could have been the plane, the bus, the hotel, the food, my co-workers, etc."
"ksgirl - if there is no soap, you can still perform hand hygiene under running water - soap acts as the 'vehicle' to remove transient bacteria/virus and yes, it is better to have - but if not available, do the 15 second rub hands together, remember the secret sides and you will still remove majority of transient stuff.As for hand sanitizers - despite what I do for a living, I am not OCD about them either - but I do carry them. As humans being we come in contact with approximately 1 million foreign pieces of bacteria/virus/fungi particles in a day - just being. Our bodies are terrific at repelling them, from our skin, to our our respiratory cilia, to our stomach acid, to our natural flora in our bowels, to our immunocompetent factors - the human body is really and truly amazing. It is when we start messing with these natural immune system pieces (broken skin, too much antacid medication, a little antibiotic just in case) that we do increase our risk of becoming sick.  Funny thing - leaving PUJ in December and I have a small bottle attached to my backpack. It is clearly a liquid. When going through security they looked at it (it is a 100ml bottle that is attached by a little key fob type thingy) and I told them what it was. I also told them I was quite happy to leave it with them if I could not take it through. The gentleman smiled and said no, we must clean our hands. My grinch heart grew two sizes that day LOL"
"I was at the Majestic Colonial DEC 30TH TO JAN 06/12;..The reports are true there was alot of illness with many groups of people and individuals.If every guest were to write you would believe how widespread this was.Many of our group took dukarol before they left home,but still managed to get ill,most there but some when they returned.None of the people I travelled with were sick on arrival and not until the 2nd or 3rd day.It is hard to pinpoint but the food temps seemed off and many guests touching pitchers,ladels etc.The grill cook alternating with same tongs between raw and cooked food .We all were very careful with the water and only used that which is bottled..all of us did very different things but sickness was common.I did not spot any quality control in the restaurants.We did not all use the pool so I discounted this.People got sick after eating in the french a la carte,late sushi that had been sitting out in the japanese and buffets.We had a guest that was with us who is in the profession of quality control re viruses etc..definitely was a food issue.It is unfortunate that folks reading these reviews are trying to blame the travellers,when we only want to caution you.Management then will not be responsible..all these people cannot be wrong!The resort can be great and we had a great deal of good times,perservered with our home brought pharmacy..I ate very selectively and minimally,I was on the lower end of the illness scale...bring antibiotics and kill the ""bug""right away..the Elegance did have control issues in the beach restaurant.Most often people to not want to comment as not sure it resulted from lifestyle choices..and believe it only happened to them.So have a nice vacation hopefully management has responded since our week there!"
"This is the response I received this morning from the Guest Services Manager at the Majestic Colonial. ""In our daily operation, we strictly follow a “health and hygiene program” that is recognized internationally as it has a North American or European standard. This program is called “Cristal” An external firm comes periodically to audit all the processes certifying after that all the food and drinks are in a healthy condition and therefore able for human consumption, and as I said before, in a North American standard. We follow all prevention methods marked by the laws and we make all the periodic monitoring of the mentioned methods to get all certificates required by law in order to avoid healthy problems. The water used in the restaurant and the ice machine is safe and pure, you don’t need to worry about that. Based on this information we are looking forward to a safe, relaxing and FUN holiday starting next Thursday. JW"
I like the hand sanitizer idea but I read a suggestion on another post that seemed obvious but made sense to use a napkin when picking up ladles or tongs in the buffet. I've not got sick at a resort yet but my wife gets 1 day where she is sick every time. We still haven't figured out why but we still go.
Yay! glad to hear you received a positive response. Let us know how your trip was! I will be piggy-backing you!
"Cristal is an excellent program - similar to our ISO or accreditation standards. If this is the framework they are using (and I do know this to be true for several PC resorts) then we need to re=introduce the idea that the traveller may have brought it with them, then told two friends who told two friends and so on . . . Incubation period for a noro type virus is between 24-72 hrs . . . Not discounting the food, but makes me ponder when a big group who share and care together for most of the vacation become ill"
"That would be about right the second and third day afflicting a number of groups,but as I have stated a number of individuals as well..of course it came from someone could be traveller or worker.There was just so many the week dec 30th-jan6th/12 so obviously not controlled.The resort is affiliated with the Cristal program with random audits.Food monitoring needs to happen every hour.Did you pick up on the fact that we had a professional food inspector in our party.I have travelled 35 winters and have never been ill.Don't stay away from the place I am sure after so many of us were ill they have checked it out.Just use common sense and bring your medicine.It is a lovely resort with great staff."
"My wife and I stayed at the Colonial Dec 22-Jan 2. Had a great, great time! Neither one of us got any stomach problems at all. Other families I spoke to (some regulars, other first timers) did not have any problems either.We brought pocket-size sanitizers that can be refilled, avoided raw vegetables/salads. We ate mostly at the buffet b/c we loved the variety of food. We did use hand sanitizers at all times, especially at meals - before and during meals, after going for seconds and touching utensils handled by other guests that could be carriers.Always used bottled water even for brushing teeth. We did not over-eat and are not heavy drinkers (just the occasional beer/wine/cocktail).All I really got was a mild cold (sore throat) the 3rd day there so I must have carried it from home or caught during the flight.In contrast, when we got back home, we found many, many friends sick with the flu here, with diarrhea, vomiting (sorry for the mental picture) without ever leaving Canada! ...and I am not blaming Canada! ;)I'm really surprised by the recent reviews..."
"well, I guess what is going to happen will happen. If I keep worrying, I am going to ruin my holiday. We arrive on Friday, will post how it goes. Hope everyone else has a good time as well!"
We arrive on Tuesday Jan. 24................If you want we can meet . I suggest a central location - i.e. the main downstairs bar. I'll be wearing sun glasses and looking very mysterious. My partner in crime is Barb she's a blonde with really nice eyes and a funny nose. The PASSWORD will be : FUNPLEASE - TELL NO ONE! jw
"ok, will keep a lookout for you! We will be the exhausted looking ones as we are going for a wedding with about 20 who are about 20 years younger than us. I may need a holiday when I get home from trying to keep up!"
Give me a name so I can call out at the bar. We'll be there around 4:00 pm.If you think we look like Hobos..............Just ignore us and move on. I will not be wearing a tie.Hahahahaha JW
"Unfortunately, the reviews are true! I had the worst experience in Punta. I fell ill then manipulated into an Ambulance onto the hospital. Extremely high heart rate, vomiting, dehydration and hypertension. None of which I came with nor deemed contagious. I quickly picked up on the fact that my care was not their priority. Their survival was. Myself and boyfriend were held hostage at the ""hospital"" until we found a way to pay them 2000.00 US dollars cash before they would call us a taxi back to our resort. They were serious as my life was seeming short! 4 hours later (after being released for near heart attack, FYI I'm a healthy, young, female sports medicine practitioner with good hygene) saw guns and handcuffs before being ""released"" to a taxi driver. A taxi driver that cried out shame to ""where he's from!"" It's very real people! Not sure the exact origin of the illness (being food, water OR IS IT THEIR SANITIZER?)All I know is that the resort was in on the whole ""hold us hostage"" situation and tried to keep us from flying out the following day with coupled threats right along side the 'private' hospital.They are very poverished and money hungry especially now (dealing with the cholera epidemic and recovery from 2010 disaster). Even embassy and taxi driver said, ""it's very sad and happens everyday""You know your completely helpless when you watch the hospital command 5 taxi drivers to turn around and leave (knowing our phone calls to family and friends got them there)!In hopes everyone stays safe, well, and doesn't fall pray to their obvious money making scams targeting tourist!Incredibly traumatized!"
"well, seems a bit dramatic but then again we weren't there. If I came to Texax for medical treatment, had no money or insurance coverage to produce I'd doubt that they would let me leave either. For a sports medicine practitioner.... nah, not even goint to go there.Hope you're all better now.PS, don't ever travel out of your own country, province or state without appropriate medical coverage."
"""They are very poverished and money hungry especially now (dealing with the cholera epidemic and recovery from 2010 disaster)""What exactly do you mean by this statement? Please clarify."
I'm sorry Texas for your scary experience!! Did the Dr's say if it was something viral?? I'm just freaking out now with my first upcoming trip in March to the Elegance!! Guess I could still cancel the whole thing since I do have insurance!! Just really thought like it sounded like a virus that was going thru the resorts.
"Very confused by all these statements.................Our company has well over 400 guests in the Hotel and we have had not one report of anyone ill or needing any help with illness................Its like going anywhere new, be sensible what you eat and drink........Enjoy your vacation................."
Cool conspiracy theory re the hand sanitizer itself being responsible for the transmission of illness - will file that one away for the day I can write the next best seller . . . I am sorry you had such a horrible experience Bb. Likely not the cholera though - that was Haiti
"I have been reading the postings.....I am scheduled to be at the Majestic Colonial on Feb 5th. I think it's the time of year for the flu, stomach bugs, etc no matter where you are................right now Im at work here in upstate NY and there is 2 people out sick with the stomach bug and they have not even left the NY State area.I just keep washing my hands and hoping that I don't get it, but seems like everyone you run into lately is sick with this or that and it seems to be that way till Sping.I need the WARM CARRIBEAN SUN shine !! I'll be there in a couple weeks.L~NY"
well said vacl123
"That's me allover right now,sick bed for the next couple of days!,wonder if i can extend it a bit longer!, for the wife to do more fetching and carrying for me,I think she needs more exercise to get trim for our next visit!."
"The latest from the Colonial.I have no doubt they are concerned and doing everything to address this issue. From the Guest Services Manager:'We are taking all the precaution need it to avoid this situation , there is few cases that not necessary is the hotel food.We have 99% of occupancy at this moment if it was a problem with the hotel food according to the Dominican Law the healthy department and ASONOHERES will be closing the resort"". JW"
Efforts to report illness are not taken seriously or not passed on by staff..response is to fill in a card;and/or no one else is sick.Who wants to spend the week in the complaint department.I believe you will see the complaints filed in the homeland.Some people could not leave the occupancy of the room and their toilet.
"I ended up in the hospital in Mazatlan once with shellfish poisoning. My friend and I ate the same plate of shrimp and I became deathly ill. I was happy they took me to the doctor, I can't remeber ever being that sick. It cost me $1000 us and there was no way I was leaving until they had payment. Would have been the same in the US.My point is, you can become ill anywhere and when you are travellling to a foreign country, get appropriate coverage."
"Yes you points are valid, but this is a multimillion dollar complex. They may have ignored the first few complaints, but their reputation is now on ""the line""I believe they are or will do everything possible to correct any inadequacies.If in fact the fault is there's."
VACL123 - see you at check in!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
"Cholera has spread to Dominican Republic ""bugsareus""! You might want to check out the CDC website, gives you pretty staggering statistics. I unfortunately knew none of this before going. Just through the awful experience did I want to come back and research what was really going on. The hand sanitizer comment was not a ""conspiracy theory"" or means of "" transit"" suggestion, it was a red flag that something is obviously trying to be contained. The interesting thing about the sanitizer is that it's a milky color, pumped from personal pumps by the staff. Also doesn't have that burn or alcohol feel like it should...just sayin that's all.We had 11 in our party and all of which got ill at some point on our 6 days of stay.The warm amazing coastline was great...just very mysterious and painful ""virus"" or whatever was eating our GI system."
JW-will you be back by the Feb 5th? Please enlighten me with good news! :)(I am going either way!)
"Hi Christine,We are excited and looking forward to our 2 week escape. As mentioned we visited the Colonial in 2006 and have been to a number of top quality spots since then. (the GBP Amber, Cayo Levantado, Mayan Palladium and the Curacao Fiesta). Barb loved the MC and insisted this was the place we had our best vacation. I love their beach, killer ambing pool, the tropical vibe and the not too big, but not small feel. I am sure we'll have a gt. time. Stomach flues are a real drag - been there and don't want a reoccurrence.Happy Trails - we'll report back JW"
Feb 7th 2012 is our return date.JW
Have a great trip....feel free to ck in while you are there! :P
"well, i will see you there on the 5th! :)"
"Elegance is getting bad reviews also...I lied, I am officially nervous!I hope in 3 weeks this is all cleared up!!!!"
"Been there, done that, X2 actually and both time in PC but different resort. Hubby was hospitalized X2, once transported by taxi and the other by ambulance...both resort doctors and hospital staff were amazing but it should be noted that we had FULL MEDICAL coverage. We now travel with not only medical coverage but our own hand sanitizer and wipes, I carry immodium and Pepto Bismol, doctor has provided with a few meds/antibiotic, just in case, we use Dukoral, eat yogourt every night (travelling or not) and start heavy doses of probiotic 30 days before we travel as while we travel as well. We are both pretty sure that when Shawn got ill, it had to do with him feeding and touching, patting stray dogs on the beach ans streets of PC. Or it could have been the food, the water, the ocean, the pool etc...who knows. Just be sure that you are INSURED. Travelling without medical coverage is like playing roullette, take your chances."
"All be it that this post is coming early, as our stay is in late July, I'm getting very nervous. I will be traveling with my wife and 3 teenagers, and wondering what is the best option for medical insurance? In addition, since I really should have a ""Plan B"" set up, any recommendations as to what resort in the area would offer the same features as the MC?"
"Cannot help with USA insurance but in Canada, I am finding that RBC insurance offers the best covergae at most reasonable cost (80.00/week for both of us), they also offer longer coverage and also family coverage) When seeking medical care, we provided our medical coverage info to the doctor at the resort and hospital, they contacted the insurer with the policy #, were provided with all info required and the doctor and hospital billed the insurance company directly. We did not have to disburse anything at all . Upon our return, the insurance company contacted us to get all the details, we signed a form and voila, all was taken care of."
"Hola,I have read most of the post and I have to admit that some posters are a bit alarmist and some others are giving very good advices.For further information, I would like to correct few things:1. CRISTAL is the world leader in hygiene and food safety certification for tourist facilities in food and beverage handling, waters treatment, legionella prevention and contemplates a monitoring and training process particularly strict. CRISTAL inspections are held at least once per month during 2-3 days and the days of the inspection are revealed only 1-2 before. The Majestic Elegance in the last year due to the high scores has been awarded by CRISTAL the Cristalissimo plaque (3 consecutive marks above 90/100) and the Cristal Annual Award and the Cristal Highless award to the high average in its marks. In the Punta Cana area only 2 hotels out of the many audited have achieved those awards. 2. Any hotel in the Punta Cana strip has a medical center for its guests, this service it is not included and has to be paid by the guest or the guest's insurance. I have read few posts and comments regarding of Hospitals taking hostage of the guests; please be aware that this Clinics are outside the resorts and do not have any relation with any of the hotels in Punta Cana; blaming a resort for something that someone elseor another company has done it is not fair.3. The hand sanitizer in the restaurants, as others have said, it is a SOP (Standard Operational Procedure) of many resorts in the world. We at Majestic did decide to start this year, 2012, as a new implementation in our standards. As any stardard we will decide in the next future if it has given the results desired or not.Lastly, as many others have said, the best advise to follow is to have a travel insurance and to take the normal preventions well known to everyone.I hope the poitn of view from an insider it will help to ease the situation.Un saludo"
When we stayed there last year there was also this issue I work in the food business and am health certified we did get sick we are absolutely sure it was from the Japanese hibachi restaurant the management hallways tries to blame the flue or norovirus or some other thing but I am sure it was the food it did not ruin our trip at all but it did happen
"I'm no expert but if you search ""Google News"" for ""norovirus"" you will see there are many cases reported in the US, Canada, UK... anyone could bring it with them and spread it to their group and other guests... don't blame the resorts."
Osc2010 you are correct all one needs to do is watch the news and see whats going on in Victoria BC over the past weekend
"Yes, there have been cases of cholera reported in the DR - but look at the locations - CDC document does state where transmission has occured and also notes that 'tourist' areas are at a very low risk."
"Hola travlezoo,I was just providing corrections to few informations that I was considering incorrect, that is all.As others have said, go on Google and type ""norovirus Unites States"" or ""norovirus Canada"" or even ""GI United States"" and you will surprise by the numbers of people affected on a yealry basis. There are so many useful links that can be really hepful and that you might want to read.On the other hand, please, note that if all the reports made on Tripadvisor and suppositions are meant to be true, the medical centers on property should have very long queues of guests in need of attention, which is not the case.Please, remember that I am here in order to provide information to future travellers and help anyone who would like to visit Punta Cana to choose the resort up to their expectations (whether it is the Elegance or another one).Un saludo from windy Punta Cana"
"I'm due to go to the Majestic Colonial in May. This has been booked since June last year and I've been getting more worried by the day due to the constant reports of sickness at this resort. I accept that with so many guests at a resort there will be a small percentage of people who bring some sort of sickness with them. Also when people travel in a large group if 1 person gets sick chances are that a high number of the party will also get the same bug as they spend so much time with each other.Over the last 6 months of following peoples reviews a few things stand out about this resort.1. People always complaining about the food standards even if they don't get sick.2. No hand sanitizer in toilets / restaurant entrances.3. 'Novovirus', 'over indulgence', 'weather' or 'your the only 1' blamed for any sickness.4. Lack of acknowledgement / response from the management that there is a problem.No matter how nice the beach is I feel that the management need to take their head out of it and admit that this resort has a problem. It gets far too many reports of sickness that a resort of this size should expect to see. Simple things like making sure hand sanitizers are filled up and making guests use it when entering the restaurants. A refresher in the importance of hygiene/cooking standards to the staff. Also by making guests aware of hygiene problems in restaurants would help solve the sickness bugs from spreading.The pool and beach is why we picked this place to take our 3yr old on her 1st overseas holiday. What I don't wont is to spend most of the 2 weeks either stuck in the room, or even in hospital, due to a problem the management should be able to prevent."
Anybody back recently? Still issues?

"i emailed the resort and here is what they sent..Good Afternoon, Thank you very much for voicing your concerns with us directly. We would very much like to assure you that the quality of our food and beverage service and the overall experience for our guests at Majestic Resorts has not changed nor deteriorated, since we originally earned your trust in the product we deliver to clients. Health, safety and quality control are programs that are foremost in our daily operations and as such we maintain daily and weekly inspections to offer the highest quality for our guests. I would like to reconfirm that our records do not indicate any unusual incidents of illness. We have an extremely thorough health/safety and quality control program in respect to food and beverage through-out both of our hotels, in addition we regularly have outside inspectors also monitoring various areas of our operation to maintain the integrity of all processes. You should also know that all water used in food preparation purified and safe for our guests. For your information we have not had any incidents of sickness that are out of the ordinary or unusual. We also receive weekly medical reports from our onsite medical team so that we are abreast of what is happening with our guests at all times. However this said, when guests come to the south they frequently drink more alcohol, and less water, eat foods they are not accustomed to at home or increase their overall consumption dramatically, add to that the Sun factor. All of these factors could contribute to a guests overall health. We consistently run at extremely high occupancy and much of the time at 100%, and I would like to reassure you that our incidence of sickness, of any type including accidents based on the number of guests we serve is minimal. I truly hope that you will continue with your vacation plans to the Majestic Resorts, with confidence. We in turn will continue to offer a terrific vacation experience and will try our best to exceed your expectations. Please if you have any additional questions do not hesitate to get in touch."
"Trikkdaddy,Thank you so much for posting your last post....we will be at the Majestic Coloninal on Feb 5. Like the posting says, sometimes too much drinking and hot sun do not mix and some people eat wayyyyy to much, their systems are not used to that. I have seen people eat 3 plates of food .....OMG!Use common sense wash your hands it is the winter season when people have colds and most of the resort are full. I know the Majestic Colonial has been full for the last 2 months.L~NY"
"Hola to everyone,Few numbers that might help you to understad the high visibility of the Majestic hotels on Tripadvisor.The Majestic Elegance during all the 2011 has got at hotel of 2009 reviews on Tripadvisor and the Majestic Colonial 1473 reviews for a total of 3482 reviews between the 2 hotels.The Punta Cana hotels listed on Tripadvisor (96) have totalized 26189 reviews in the 2011, this means that the Majestic Colonial and the Majestic Elegance combined have the 13,30% per cent of the reviews in the area. This means that both resorts get way more visibility than resorts with 50-100-200 reviews in a year and in total. A part from that, you need to consider that both hotels at full capacity have at 2500-2700 guests on a daily basis staying at the resort and if something wrong is happening the medical center was going to have more than the usual % of cases/guests. Nobody on here is blaming anyone, getting sick is normal here in Punta Cana and back in Europe from where I am from or in the States where most of you are from. What everyone here should be aware is about the flu spreading on winter time at home that can casue these consecuences when travelling to a different climate. That drinking way too much is affecting your organism, that eating uncommon food to your diet is having consecuences and that drinking water is far more important than taking too much sun.Un saludo"
I cannot wait to be there on the 5th! thank you very much for posting the info!!!!
"Hello Romitello,Everyone that goes on holidays only wants two things - a safe and good time.Your information is appreciated. Who are you and where do these facts come from. Are you part of the Majestic Corporation or a government agency? It appears you are well versed in the industry."
jw--Romitello is the Rooms Division Manager at Majestic Elegance. He's worn a lot of different hats there. He was previously the Club Manager. He has provided lots of facts on this forum.
Thank you for responding Romitello. I am really looking forward to my trip to Majestic Colonial next week and your response put some concerns to rest. Sunshine here I come!!
"Hola JohnnyWeston,As desiwood said I do work at the Majestic Elegance and I am on here to provide information to future travellers interested in Punta Cana (not necessary only on Majestic) and to find out what our guests think of our product and services.Un saludo"
Romitello - You are awesome!! To come on this thread and state fact after fact and place this situation in perspective for everyone just proves what a class act the Majestic resorts really are! Good for you...My personal experience at the Majestic Colonial was a fantastic vacation! One of the best yet.... hope to return one day soon!
"Thanks for the information Romitello. Best Regards, JW"
"A few tips to prevent stomach problems. Do not drink the tap water in rooms or even use it to brush your teeth. Use only bottled water and ensure that seal hasn't been broken- sometimes staff will just refill the bottle from the tap in room. If you have kids with you wrap the faucet with a facecloth or plastic bag so the kids won't accidentally use the water.Take a pepto tablet with meals- I take one at breakfast and supper, if my tummy starts to feel funny then I will take another at lunch. Take a small bottle of hand sanitizer and use it before eating. I also take digest enzymes because the oils they use for cooking are heavier and act as a laxative for me. Acidophilus pills help as well or eat yogurt daily- I always have some yogurt for breakfast or at lunch if it's available. As others have mentioned wash your hands but that only stops you from spreading, it doesn't stop you from getting the virus or bug especially if it is a food or drink that is the cause."
"We are flying out on the 24th for a week at the MC, and it is discouraging to see the high number of reviews. I have read the MC staff responses on the thread and appreciate that they are having a presence here.However, it is a concern to see that many posts, when in the past there were not any. I don't think it makes sense to just classify this as a normal sick incident due to heat and over-indulgance , when the number of comments about sickness is not normal.It could be a nasty virus has gotten into the resort, and with the high churn rate and high occupancy, it is staying alive with new guests picking it from folks who leave before them. I would expect that the MC will be putting an extra effort to both ensure cleaniness with the food prep, and provide the appearance of doing so. ie. Guests should not see potential cross contamination between raw and cooked food at a grill.I will be taking hand santizer with me, and a few items mentioned in this thread as a precaution, and hopefully everything goes well. The precaution about using bottled water, even for tooth brushing is noted. Is there any problem getting extra bottles from the MC staff or bars, or is it just what is left in you mini-bar each day. I don't think it would be a bad idea for guests to e-mail MC, and indicate that it is unfortunate about the bug that seems to be making the rounds and that you anticipate they will be making an extra effort to ensure sanitary conditions.This is our first All Inclusive vacation, and if it is a bust I doubt my spouse will be very interested in another."
"I didn't personally stay at Majesty but in Punta Cana. The resorts are simply not volunteering or providing the information. It's going on, it wasn't just my party of 11, it was heard by 'pass er bys' on the property, in the hospital, on the plane...It's a cholera epidemic in this area. I only ate baked chicken, veggies, fruits and grain. Not a lot of acclamation needed. However, the stinch of sewer water we smelled every time we walked over a small bridge in the resort took more to get used to than any. Drank bottled water, took all precautions and still fell ill.Honestly, it is alarming ....came home after my incident and found recovery was slower than expected. The only commonality I had remaining was my morning cups of resort bought coffee (beans). I phoned my family 3 hours away and asked how they liked theirs. Good but both had diarrhea for some reason?! Coffee was tossed by both parties and symptoms resided in 24 hours.It's is my belief that some of this outbreak is beyond the resorts control or understanding. This virus is passed by contaminated water and their local vegetation consumes this water source while the resorts take much of this business in. When there is an epidemic in your backyard, your chances are naturally higher. Definitely higher than the odds of bringing it there from the u.s.The only thing I can hold my visited resort accountable for is the poor customer service, very poor...and dishonest in my personal situation."
They close other topics but yet this continues. Hmm. LOL
"It is crucial that this continues as long as this situation continues uncontrolled by the resort.Responses indicate this may have been going on since xmas.Ask anyone who has been tested I believe a parasite has been identified,that spreads quickly. The comment from Ottawa is bang on..so many folks cannot be wrong.Cholera may be an overeaction.We cannot determine where this started but appears to spread quickly,may have been a tourists or worker at the resort..but the resort is ultimately responsible to identify that many custiomers were affected,.."
"So we got back yesterday. We were fine until eating at the Seafood restaurant, which was one of the worst meals I have ever eaten. My wife had Red Snapper, which was just generic fishy tasting, mushy and with an insipid sauce. She also had the Seafood Bisque, which tasted like red flavoured broth from stewing fish bones for a few hours. After that meal she had stomach cramps and some diarrhea on and off for the rest of the trip and is still having some effects. We are very light drinkers, and hadn't been out in the sun that long. Can't say for sure the bad meal was the problem, but she picked up something there.We only did the Steak restaurant later on, and it was fine. She was eating lightly and had to keep the food very plain so we stuck to the buffet otherwise. I did like the hotel's overall standard of cleanliness. There was always staff cleaning and doing maintenance, all staff picked up any litter, and different utensils were used to put raw food on the grill and to flip the cooking food. This was a clean resort, to bad for whatever bug nailed my spouse."
