"Planning our 1st safari to kenya and my sister in law tells me that if we need yellow fever jabs then she cannot go as it is a live vaccine and her current medication means she can not have any live vaccine jabs. No plans to cross any borders. just kenya, safari, and homeJO"
"Hi,The YF jab is recommended but not compulsory, I personally chose to have it, but although it is a nasty disease the risk in Kenya is low.According to this Department of Health funded site there were only 2 non-vaccinated European or American traveller deaths from YF contracted in Africa (not in Kenya) between 1996 and 2007See the 'Risks for Travellers' section on this pagewww.nathnac.org/travel/factsheets/YF.htm"
"You DO NOT have to have yellow fever jabs just to vsit Kenya especially if going from UK. Its a volatile subject re risk, personally Im happy to go away next week without it after views read on here and a chat with a friend of my husband who works at the London Hospital for Tropical Diseases.There are many people who travel who both choose not to have it or due to medications or egg allergies cannot tolerate it."
You normally only need a yellow fever certificate if you are traveling FROM a country where the disease is endemic. If you come from the UK you will not have yellow fever (or at least you will not have caught it in the UK). Basically the certificate is nothing to do with the chances of you catching it - they just don't want you to bring it in to the country.
A lot of us would be very interested to hear from any health professional who would go on record as saying there's any measurable risk of getting YF in Kenya. Personally I think the drug companies have cynically exploited WHO recommendations for nearly two decades to extract millions of pounds for unnecessary YF vaccinations from tourists making simple return journeys to Kenya.

"Yankari - I don't think you can blame the drugs companies (on this occasion). Many travel agents and lots of GPs do not seem to know the rules & state that you need a yellow fever certificate - they leave out the all important - if you are travelling from a country where YF is endemic.You seem to have fallen into the common trap – the yellow fever certificate is to protect the country not the individual traveller. Countries where there is a danger of an epidemic often have this rule – if you are coming from, or have recently been in, a country where there is yellow fever you need the certificate to show that you are not bringing it with you.The African/Asian/etc. countries where a case could easily spread (generally due to a smaller percentage of local people having had the vaccination – for which I guess you may be able to point the finger at the cost of the drugs) don’t really care if you catch the disease – but they don’t want you coming in if you could be responsible for starting an outbreak involving 100s or 1000s of cases."
"Hi TonyI understand the certificate rule, and the need for the YF certificate if you're crossing borders between transmission-zone countries. What I don't understand is why health professionals routinely *advise* people who are *only* going to Kenya from their home country outside the transmission zone to have the jab at all. There have been no recorded cases of YF in Kenya since 1993. And that was a very remote and very limited outbreak, the first and only time YF has ever been recorded in Kenya, and its source is still unknown. Richard"
Yankari - agreed that incorrect information is often given out - but the finger needs to be pointed at those GPs who get it wrong (for which there is no excuse) & travel agents who can't be bothered to look up the facts. The information is easily available these days. 11 reported cases in 1995 apparently (WHO) - 7 in 1994 27 in 1993 & 1995 so you are very unlikely to catch it in Kenya.
"If you SIL is allergic to eggs, over age 60 or 65 or has any other medical reason for not having the YF jab, she only needs a letter from her doc to this effect. As I and others (Yankari/Richard) have mentioned previously... YF is only ""recommended"" for those arriving from western countries (non-yellow-fever countries), i.e., Western Europe, US, Canada, etc. Only if crossing borders of various African countries is the YF jab required/compulsory, with the exceptions as noted above. You the traveler are still responsible to learn the facts, discuss with your personal physician and then make the appropriate decision. "
"In that respect, is the certificate needed when re-entering the UK from the infected country (i.e. kenya)?"
No as far as the UK is concerned Kenya is not an infected country - although it is in the Yellow fever belt
No - the UK doesn't have the climate/mosquitos to have a danger of an epidemic - and you won't catch YF in Kenya anyway - less than 100 cases reported between 1995 & 1990 and none since.
"""If you SIL is allergic to eggs, over age 60 or 65 or has any other medical reason for not having the YF jab, she only needs a letter from her doc to this effect.""So as long as only going to Kenya .... we dont need a letter even I trust from all other info received otherwise ... Im knackered!!! "
"Yep - travelling between the UK and Kenya you do not have to have an injection, a certificate or a letter.Despite all the debate about the jab itself this has only ever been disputed once in all the dozens of threads about YF on this forum "
"Hi, there are no requirments for YF when entering UK. as there is no chance of infecting another person. YF is transmitted from person to person by the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito in the same way that Malaria is transmitted. If the mozzy is not endemic to the country then there is no chance of YF being transmitted. Its not present in the UK so no transmission, even if you have the disease.Ivan "
A letter from my GP. Will that stop me from catching anything then? Could save me a fortune . . . 
thanks everyone for your advice on YF jabs. This has certainly helped and now we can carry on planning our trip. Many ThanksJo
just been to travel clinic today at my GP's given info on 3 different types of malaria tablets available. Also advised need Yellow feever jab & hepatitis B.Told her that yellow fever was only needed if travelling between countries in Africa. She was adamant it was needed & someone she knew who worked at the surgery had just returned from Kenya & had had to show the certificate.Anyone else had to show a certificate recently?
"That is absolute rubbish, even the NHS website specifically says a certificate is not needed for entry to the UKnhs.uk/Conditions/…Prevention.aspx"
Sounds like they are on commission for glaxo !
Thats what I thought but I was just checking if anyone had been asked to show a certificate?
"It seems its becoming a major source of income to misadvise on vaccinations, its not so bad when they say we advise such and such but its up to you another entirely to tell you things that are not right. Hep B is no more an essential than yellow fever."
"we went to kenya in april this year at no time was we asked to show any proof of vaccines going into kenya or coming home to england,"
