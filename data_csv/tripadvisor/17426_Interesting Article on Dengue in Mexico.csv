An interesting article from the Associated Press about the spread of Dengue in Mexico and what is being done to combat it:…yahoo.com/s/…dengue_epidemic
"It's an important post, Robert, so thanks for posting the link. Awareness is an important part of prevention. Also a comment for frequent (really all) travelers to check to make sure their ""chemicals"" haven't exceeded any expiration date. It is easy to leave them in the suitcase and when you finally think of it and check it has been expired. I re-stock on even numbered years.Do you happen to know what chemicals are typically sprayed or ""fogged"" by the resorts? "
Thanks for the info! I already bought my OFF with 100% deet........to use while we are there and in the jungle tours etc! Can't be too safe!Looking forward to our trip in 17 days!!! So excited!From:ddcile5:)
Thanks for the info Robert. Excellent post. We never thought much about dengue until Tony got it this summer...twice in one month! A rare occurance the Doctor told us but it does happen. Now we start each day by spraying down with Deet.Tony and CheriLuna Blue Hotel and Garden
"I also paid little attention to dengue until I had a case of dengue hemorrhagic this year. After being in the hospital in the hospital and months getting well, I now pay attention . I was surprised at the excellent hospital and doctor care I had in Cozumel. I could not have asked for better.So, I hope people will pay attention to the little but mighty mosquito!As far as how resorts are protected, I really dont know. But would think they fog as Cozumel and other cities do."
" Robert, I just finished reading the article i saw on Aol just this night and i saw where Pureto Vallarta, Cancun and Acapulco were named also. Sorry to say this has changed my travel plans to Hawaii. With the article statement that this could emerge as a pandemic i'm going to go to Hawaii. No vaccine has been developed for this and i'm not willing to take the chance.Thanks for the info.Moonmaiden"
"Thanks for the info Robert. Our niece, who has been a resident of Cozumel for the past dozen years and became a Mexican Citizen this year, told us about the dengue on Cozumel a couple years ago. We've always brought our Deet with us but this year we'll use it. "
Last time I checked they have Dengue fever in Hawaii 
"Indeed, Hawaii has experienced dengue on quite a large scale. It is also beginning to reach the southern states of the U.S. Apparently there have been no cases recorded above 5,000 feet - so I'm safe for the moment!"
"When we went to Hawaii several years ago, there were two or three areas that we really wanted to explore that were completely closed off due to dengue issues. Anywhere with mosquitos can have a dengue problem. The key is to keep yourself protected from them by spraying yourself. If you do that, you shouldn't have a problem.Tony & CheriLuna Blue Hotel & Garden"
"Thanks Robert, That report is rather unsettling I must say. I've always brought my spray with DEET but never used it and have never gotten a bite but I certainly will be using it this year."
"Robert or Cheri, is there a particular time of year they are worse than other times? We've been last week of Nov, first week of Dec last 4 years and have only seen one skeeter. But then I've also seen the resort fogging so that may be why. Only thing I could think of when I saw that was what else were they killing besides myself?"
"Playa is surrounded by jungle so mosquitos can occur anytime. However they are most plentiful during the rainy times of year (late summer and fall). But remember, while dengue can be very serious, particularly the hemorrhagic version that Robert and Tony had, it is still not common. Bring your insect repellent and you will be fine.Tony and CheriLuna Blue Hotel and Garden"
"Well, Guess i will just take my vacation to PDC and not worry, but i can't seem to get over the thought of sitting on the beach with bug spray all over my body. Who wants to sit behind a screen porch and look at the sunset. I figure if i don't go into the jungle i should be better off on the beach but the whole thing just put a damper on the thought of my vacation.What to Do? Who wants to go on vacation and get a flu like disease and return home sick? Guess you just roll the dice and run with it. But i sure wish the article on AOL didn't appear.MoonMaiden77"
"Toni and Cheri,You've made me feel better. I usually travel in Feb to get away from Boston's cold winter and have never had a bug problem. I thought that it was a combination of the time of year and the resort itself spraying a lot (which does bother you to an extent). I feel better knowing that the season as a lot to do with it too. I'll stick to my Feb vacations and will definately put the DEET on at night."
"Mosquitos are usually not a problem right on the beach because of the breezes blowing. Especially in Playa where the beach and the jungle are generally pretty far apart. In some places in Tulum, however, the beach and the jungle are closer, and there would be a bit more of a problem. In town, however, especially during the rainy season, there are mosquitos and you need to protect yourself, especially if you're someone who tastes good to mosquitos (like we do). Vitamin B complex helps to keep them away from you, too, but it's not a foolproof solution. Look at it this way--those of us who live here use mosquito repellent on a regular basis and it doesn't put much of a damper on our lives. It really won't be that much of an inconvenience for you on a short vacation, we promise. :)Tony & CheriLuna Blue Hotel & Garden "
"Thanks Cheri, I use B complex daily and if we head off into the jungle areas, like the bird aviary in Playacar, will use lots of DEET."
"Well, I am now terrified. We planned a one week trip over the holidays with our 3 kids, including a toddler. We were staying at the Fairmont but planned for one parent to take the older kids on a bunch of tours of Mayan Ruins, Cenotes, Etc. My husband already thought I was crazy to take kids to Mexico (worried about them getting sick from the food), but this may just mean we need to cancel. Is this really a reasonable risk to take. We will drench them in Deet (we are used to that, no problem) but presumably even that is not foolproof? I could cry...sigh."
How does the B Complex protect one from mosquitos and what dose is effective?
