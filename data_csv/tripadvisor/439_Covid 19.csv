Any covid 19 on grand exuma
"Strangely, I was just commenting to my wife 1 minute ago that there was no mention of the Covid 19 at all on this forum today given the craziness going on in the States this week."
We have travel plans for the 21st. Direct flight from Toronto. Trying to decide if we should cancel.
"According to PM Minnis on March 2, ""the Ministry of Health has developed a national preparedness and response plan to ensure readiness and response to the virus in the event in affects The Bahamas."" So, they are going to take this seriously, but your guess is as good as mine on any future restrictions; it will probably depend on from where the threat (other than cruise ships) rears its head....Sorry to hear you may cancel...a buddy of mine just heard Disney World is shutting down on the 15th - they had been planning a trip this month with the kids - very sad...Edited: 11:06 pm, March 12, 2020 "
My place of work (local government) said anyone who travels out of the country over spring break will not be allowed to return to work for 14 days whether sick or not and must use personal leave.
The news just reported no cases in the Caribbean. I hope it stays this way.
"They did have one case in Grand Cayman yesterdayEdited: 4:52 am, March 13, 2020 "
I am coming down on May 2. If my plane is still flying i am getting on it! Fingers crossed.
"No reported cases though of course no testing. There are many at risk individuals among, and effectively no advanced health care for the people of Exuma. *please* do not bring coronavirus to the island. If you give Mom (of Mom's bakery) COVID, she will face almost certain death. There are many older people with comorbidities in the community. Heed the advice of the medical and public health experts. If you do go, (or are there now) practice social distancing - assume you may be a asymptomatic/presymptomatic and infectious and protect the locals.*Do not go if you are sick or have had known or suspected exposure*"
We are on Great Exuma right now and everything is good here but I guess that you are more worried about airports
We are here now and it’s all good
"@steve: Noting that it has been ""all good"" everywhere, until it is all of a sudden very much not ""all good"". Canada will soon have advisory recommending against all international travel, as US has already. It's going to be a rough ride for the Bahamas with the tourism impact on top of Dorian. Economies come back and hopefully this will be short lived. Dead people don't. Stay safe and protect the local people (and tip well, while remaining 6 feet from anyone!)"
"This doesn't mention any confirmed cases in the Bahamas, but many Caribbean nations and Latin American countries have confirmed cases. I saw this article yesterday - https:/…article241136896.htmlWe are supposed to travel in a few weeks and are up in the air on what to do. :( Stay safe everyone!"
We can't get any one to answer at silver air. There is no U.S. to Exuma ban. I imagine we have no trip insurance other than evacuation plan. The Bahamas Web site doesn't have anything to say about visitors from Florida last I checked earlier. The local economy is tourism if I'm not mistaken that would be a huge hit one them if people stopped coming I wonder how they feel?
"Those I have spoken to are very worried about their economy, and very worried about their health. The US and Canada have now both issued advisories against any travel out of the country, which should trigger cancellation insurance (although obviously check your policy).Edited: 7:26 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"I’m arriving 3/28 from the US if our flights don’t get canceled! My work is only restricting work travel so for now I’m safe going, my girls school is shut down until April 6! I’m going to be ready for this get away more than ever!!!Edited: 9:28 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"We are flying in from Florida on Sunday. Unfortunately we have to fly through Atlanta (only fly Delta) but praying for no cancellations. Happy to support the locals and hope we are given the opportunity. I imagine it's scary for them to need the dollars but risk someone coming in who could even be a carrier. Luckily we haven't traveled anywhere out of our state in the past few months and have no confirmed cases in our county. I don't think the US would dare do a complete travel ban as Wall Street would probably collapse... I can say we are the only ones that we know that didn't cancel a previously scheduled spring break trip. sad. With the exception of the Atlanta airport, I think we are safer in the exumas than in Florida!"
Vicky M and anyone else considering travelling to any of the islands get tested before boarding any aircraft this virus spreads quickly and would be detrimental to The Bahamas .
Don K I am not sure people can get tested that easily. At least not in my Florida county. We are supposed to travel May 31 so maybe by then this will be much better. And maybe by then it will be easier to be tested in which case I would like to do that... although you could test clean on Friday then travel Saturday and pick it up at an airport then walk around vectoring during your stay.
"We're supposed to leave for Long Island on April 3. I can't bear the thought of unwittingly bringing this disease to an island. My heart is heavy over the affect this will have on the Out Islands, but protecting vulnerable residents is more important.I agree, Donk_00, we should get tested before travel. Unfortunately, the U.S. government has bungled their response and tests are not yet available for those showing symptoms and whose doctors are requesting tests. South Korea has tested more people in the past 24 hours than the U.S. has during the entire crisis. With the long incubation period for this disease, that could mean U.S. citizens travelling and bringing this with them.I'm worried that we won't be able to go, but understand the reasons why we might have to postpone."
"Kristen E, It is a tough call, I am surprised testing is not prevalent in the US , hopefully by May its done and dusted but until that time comes i guess we'll have to keep a close eye on travel restrictions , which will more than likely come !Edited: 8:04 am, March 14, 2020 "
"We are in the same situation. Flights from Detroit to Great Exuma and staying on Little Exuma. Appears as if no cases reported, but also not certain there is access to testing kits in the Bahamas? I've reached out to some people I know who live on the island and they are responding with no reported knowledge of reported illness.It may be nice to escape the chaos of the states but horrible to experience shopping shortages if the same response is taking place in the Exuma grocery stores.The other concern is getting stranded in the Bahamas without return flights if Trump were to restrict return travel? Although I would love to be ""stranded"" on the island of Exuma under different conditions!"
"we leave in june , i never though of being there and having no return flights , we do have a house could stay there i guess as long as food is available , got me thinking now , maybe it will be over by then"
We are also supposed to travel in April. The current measures underway in the US are in place to flatten the bell curve so the medical community can better handle to situation. Our biggest dilemma is potentially exposing our friends if we can travel. This is not an easy situation for any of us.
"my issue is that we have a house rented with the person , im sure in worse case travelocity might refund our air , dont know if the person would or not . i really want to go , wait and see how things play out , we leave in june"
We are enroute now. All Americans would be able to catch flights back even if travel becomes restricted. Americans in Europe are returning still. They just have to funnel through certain airports. Im so happy to get away from all this chaos!
"with all this going on ,i am guess we should arrive a little early ? more than normal ?"
We are due to arrive Sunday 4/5 and were just notified our Silver Airlines flight into GGT is canceled and there are no other flights in on Sunday. We are now (possibly unreasonably optimistically) looking at alternative flights to arrive a day early on American Airlines.
"I was just down at Exuma Markets and you do see people being very careful and using sanitizers . I suppose most, but not all, of the offshore sailboat era have either been there are traveled down over at least a 14 day period so would know if they are sick. A boat is a pretty good place to quarantine someone! It all is calm and people seemed to be acting safely and rationally. Probably just a matter of time until every country has some. As for testing, what many countries are doing if they don’t have kits is sending the samples to US CDC labs. It would add a few days for notice but I saw that’s what some have done.. Perhaps Nassau will get some testing ability at some point if not already. They did provide supplies to that cruise ship that docked."
The flu in 2017 killed over 61000 in USA. No panicking over that.
"Way different, you need to view the current charts, etc,."
"First case in Bahamas was disclosed today. A woman in her 60's in Nassau is what we were told here at our resort. Her daughter had traveled to Trinidad they said . The guy at customs felt pretty certain that like other places, it's probably already here in higher numbers but symptoms could be confused as flu. And so it begins here. At least it's easier to socially distance here!"
It's pretty simple. We all need to be responsible adults. I cancelled my LONG anticipated glorious 12 days on Exuma last Tuesday. I'm really surprised it took till Thursday night for someone to ask the Covid question on this forum! I am now refinishing my kitchen cabinets instead of sucking down cold Kaliks on a beautiful beach. BUMMER!!!! I will now start anticipating a glorious 12 days on Exuma when this whole thing runs its course. Can't imagine being the person who is responsible for infecting one of my family or anyone else for that matter. I hate being an adult!!!!!
"Same here #33 we have postponed our trip to the end of May, hopefully by then this situation has been cleared up or under control but just couldn’t risk of either bringing this to the island or worse yet needing emergency care while there! Very sad but I know it’s for the best..."
We postponed until the end of October.
"We cancelled our mid-April trip. It was painful, but definitely felt like the right thing to do."
"ours is in mid june , i am waiting a little longer"
"@cookingGirl73 We are suppose to leave April 14th for 10 days out of PHL, at this point I don't know what to do, if we should cancel? I might wait it out another week and decide then."
Cancel...
"@ACW0310 April 14 was our arrival date, too. Very, very sad to cancel a family vacation we were all so looking forward to."
"I did cancel today, it is so sad, but it feels right! I have another trip with my daughter end of June, hoping that this will work out."
Just cancelled our trip for early April. This will break our family's streak of 15 years in a row. Totally sucks but have to be responsible here.
We broke our 10 year streak of going to a different Out Island last year due to Dorian.
I know from personal experience how disappointing it is to have to cancel a vacation.FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITY NOBODY SHOULD GO TO THE BAHAMAS AT THIS TIME.
"No reported cases on any of the Out Islands, and it could stay that way unless someone unknowingly brings it with them......of course we have no test kits, or facilities for other than general care. I've felt the need to self isolate for 14 days every time I venture out to the store just because I don't know who might have come in from off island."
"how did you cancel ? i booked my air with travelocity and took ins also , they told me i couldnt cancel i could re schedule but no refund"
"Unless your trip is later this summer, I would cancel. If you unknowingly take virus to Exuma, it could be terrible for the island. They don't have medical facilities like the US does and look how the US is struggling. The loss of life could be tremendous. Please rethink your trips until this is over"
No flights into Bahamas I know until end of month.
"Good Night,There are NO confirmed cases on the island of Exuma, however all airports throughout The Bahamas remain close to incoming flights carrying passengers, and a 24 Hour Curfew is in place as a measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19 throughout The Bahamas.

Just pushed next week's trip back to October....2 hours on Expedia help line with some guy from India - there has got to be a better way to move a trip...Maybe mid-June or July for a spring-summer make-up...don't know how they are getting by without tourist bucks...
