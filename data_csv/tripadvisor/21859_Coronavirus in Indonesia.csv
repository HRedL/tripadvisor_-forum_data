"Yep In Depok - West Java province , Jakarta neighborhood https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/03/…Cheers DEdited: 1:20 am, March 02, 2020 "
"The two reported cases in Depok, Jakarta, a woman and her mother, well, the woman went to a first hospital for a cough and fever but was not tested for Covid-19, then she was released and at home felt bad again. Up until this time nobody suspected she had Covid-19. So around 70 nurses and staff in the first hospital are being tested for Covid-19 and of course her mother has it. There may be friends who might have caught it from her and her maid is being tested too. She went to the second hospital after her Japanese friend who lives in Malaysia called her to tell her that he has Covid-19 and she told the hospital that she probably had it. The point of this story is really to point out how easily it can spread.Probably there will be updated news on this soon."
