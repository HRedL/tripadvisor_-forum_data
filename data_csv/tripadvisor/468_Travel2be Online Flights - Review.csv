"A WARNING TO ALLI searched SkyScanner for flights for my son to travel Vancouver to Toronto. We are in Australia. I picked some Air Canada flights and was redirected to the travel2be site. 'Fees and Taxes' were added to my original price which I decided to suck up and started the purchase process. To my amazement after I checked the price before entering my credit card details to the moment before I clicked to purchase the price had increased by $250!! I quickly backed out of the transaction and went directly to Air Canada where the price was, surprise, surprise $250 cheaper than travel2be. Such a scam! Definitely do not use this website If my son or his friend we're booking online they would've fallen for the scam hook, line and sinker."
"Use Skyscanner to find out who flies on routes and for nothing else. It doesn't redirect you anywhere, it produces a list of fares for flights that are most likely not based on live pricing unless they happen to be from an airline as opposed to a shonky third party.You retain full control of where you choose to go to book. You don't have to choose any of the fares that are listed, and you can see who the results have come from before you decide to go there.I'm so glad you had the sense to not complete the booking!"

"This website is incredibly deceptive and I believe outright misleading in it's travelers insurance claims. They say that it is the most comprehensive insurance out there, and they refuse to refund anything if any part of the flight has been used. Only after purchase are you made aware of this and I called them out on it, only to be put off and have my flight ultimately cancelled. This company uses fraudulent practices and I warn all travelers to avoid using them, known as Travel2be and travelgenio.comYou've been warned."
"Hello Arya, we can help you with the management of your insuranced ticket. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with your booking code and the arrangement you want to make and we will tell you if it is possible and the steps to follow. Regards"

"I have never had such bad experience with a travel company. They delayed making a simple change to my ticket for a month then for some reason were unable to, despite the fact that the airline told me it should be easy. So I've had to cancel my ticket at the last minute and rebook another ticket, costing me £350. I wish I had seen all the other negative reviews first. What an expensive mistake."
"Hi, we would like to know why the delay of what you comment. Could you please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com? Thanks in advance"
">>>I wish I had seen all the other negative reviews first. What an expensive mistake.<<<Indeed it is, but take solace form the fact that you are far from alone. This forum is full of very similar sentiments from people who should have done some research first. Some of them have even lost more than you have.At least you've learnt an important, if rather expensive lesson. At least, I hope you have!"
"DO NOT BOOK FLIGHTS WITH THIS COMPANY. Whatever you do, do not book flight with Travel2Be or TravelGenio or others that search engines such as Skyscanner send you to. They are misleading foreign travel agents which are really shady and do not provide you with anything. No refunds, cant change your booking and overall very dodgy. STAY AWAY!"
No refunds and non-changeable bookings are not exclusive to third party agents.
">> No refunds, cant change your booking <<third party sites offer the cheapest flights for your route/date. If you are wanting to pay the premium for a refundable/changeable flight you are best to do this direct with the airlineDid the ticket rules you were shown show that changes and refunds were permitted? did you read them?"
"What a terrible company. I booked a flight to Geneva using their travel agency, then they cancelled my flight without notifying me, claiming that I never paid for the flight. They failed to assist me in getting another flight at the same cost, and claimed that there was no seats on the flight I had previously booked even though there was (I booked the flight on my own later that day). Never, ever using their services again."
"Hi Jenny, Send us all the details to this email address: customer.service@travel2be.com Our team will review the incident and we will keep you informed. Regards"
"I booked a flight with Travel2be through skyscanner and needed to simply change the flight from the Wed to the Mon. I called the 03 number in Australia thinking it would take 10 mins, I was on the phone for an hour, the lady put me on hold 3 times for 15 mins each - the first time just to see if there was another flight available. I was then told the change would cost me 400 euros when it says on their website any change would cost 30 euros - (plus airline fee which was $80). I asked to speak to her supervisor - she refused. I ended up hanging up the phone as I wasn't getting anywhere. I thought I'd write a letter of complaint on the websites complaint page - and surprise surprise, when you click on submit, nothing happens!!! You can't even get a letter of complaint to this sham of a company so I wrote the same letter to the ACCC instead.I will never use this website to book a flight again!!!!"
"If you had spent one minute doing a search in this forum, you'd have seen many many other complaints."
Since when did the ACCC have jurisdiction over a company based in Spain?
"Hello gpmansfield;We can help you with your booking schedule changes. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with your booking reference and the changes you want to make and we will inform you about the changes possibilities of your ticket rate and, if they are allowed, the conditions for the changes. Regards"
"Just because a company is based overseas, to provide a service in this country they are still governed by our laws that the ACCC is supposed to uphold."
That's a great insight. Very profound. And totally helpful!
Rubbish. You obviously have no understanding of the scope of the powers of the ACCC or the law.
Frommy is a knowledgeable poster. Can you explain what enforcement powers the ACCC has over a Spanish company that is operating via the world wide web?
"Booked Flights today because anonther website had re directed me nto travel2be website. Was significantly cheaper and when I finished, the date had changed. I immediatly got on the phone to point the mistake out, only to find a rude Customer Service person that would not let me talk to her supervisor, and proceeded to tell me that it was $47 per person to cancel the bookings ($94) and that would be the cheapest option. I would've gladly paid a small amount to change the flight, but she told me to change it would increase the fee by $200 and also the cancellation fee would still apply as well as an $18 transfer fee..Rip off merchants.Kindly told them where to go."
"Hi Martin, please send us all the details to customer.service@travel2be.com and we will see the charges and contact you asap. Regards"
"Martin, was the other website Kayak, Skyscanner or a similar search engine? If so, they don't redirect you, you still decide whether to click on whatever results appear. These search sites don't vet or approve the sites that appear in the results based on quality. You need to check out whoever the company offering the flights are before you make any commitment.It's vital to understand how these things work, so that you can make an informed decision on who to book with."
"Same here. I also booked a ticket whose price was increased of €100 with additional fees. Further, they are asking another huge fee to change and anticipate my booking. They also charged credit cards commision twice.NEVER HAD SUCH A BAD BOOKING EXPERIENCE. WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN."
"Hi Luca, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
Worst Travel Agency of ALL TIME !!!Do NOT Use them !!!!
"Hi Slavco, please send us all the info to customer.service@travelgenio.com and our team will be pleased to assisst you. REgards"
Not a good website to use at all. All they care about is money not customer . I strongly don't recommend this website.

Do you know the meaning of customer service? Horrible company and you should be forced to close down.
"Travelginio - why havnt these people been "" helped"" already?Wondering why it takes a complaint , or numerous complaints, on a very popular forum for them to get an "" offer"" of help!,?Unfortunately some people on this forum ( and beyond) do not do research into third party agents, and mostly seem to get caught out and usually not being helped!I hope your offer of help is genuine! . ? But if it's not I'm sure, no certain, we will here about it Have a good dayLynne"
Sorry again for double posting ! Grr... Don't know how I do it! Lol

"Travelgenio you have missed the point!There are lots and lots of people out there who have got no help at all. So they post their problem on this forum in the hope some one can helpYour customers should not have a problem to begin with, but when they do the company you work for should willingly assist these customersIf you read all of the comments on here you will not be able to deny there is a huge problem with the way this company does business!It seems to me that you offer help to customers only once they have posted their complaint on a public forumAnd now lots of us know we will never book with you!

"Thank you for the Quick Reply, I had alreday send the mail waiting for the response. I just called up your customer care they said the payments get canclled so can u please let me know if the payments is cancalled then i will go ahed and do the next bokking"
"Never ever booking with TRAVEL2BE AGAIN. I have bought a “Cheap” ticket with them but it was a fake.. it was not cheap they have added 80 dollars extra for using a credit card. then mentioned it in the end.. and some suppose to miss it. I booked a ticket to turkey.. due to UD in SWEDEN they did not recommend us to travel to Istanbul due to security issues. I called Travel2be and they said Its OK.. Istanbul is not safe now and the company will refund you. I have been waiting now for almost a month and called them several times and asked them to send me a confirmation via email, but they never do. My card get stolen and the bank locked it. I called to the bank and they told me to call back travel2be and give them my new credit card number do... After waiting like 40 minutes they asked me to get a document from the bank about my Credit card is locked and got a new one. They guy from customer support said he will send a request about which document is needed. Guess what... I never got an email... HAHA the funny part was when I called the bank and told them about their request they laughing and should not be needed."
"Hi Amir, please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will be more than pleased to assist you in all your requirements. Regards"
"Unfortunately I did not read all these posts before. I strongly recommend not using this website because they sell tickets that then they are not able to handle, modify or change in any way, blaming the airlines. I was not able to reserve my seats in advance and they were never able to help me in any way. They sold me an Air France ticket with a so called ""light fare"" that does not even include baggage! At this point, better book with the low cost companies!!! At least you pay less!"
"Hi Maria Chiara, we would like to check what happened and why you couldn't reserve the seats. The rates are the ones that the airline offers, with or without luggage depending on their own policy. The same happens with the changes or modifications, as intermediates we need to have the airline authorisation for any request of these type. Please send us all your details to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will contact you asap. Regards"
I have booked a flight for tomorrow morning that I have been unable to get my ticket for from this scam company. Have called up twice and spoken to some of the most unhelpful service operators ever. If I don't get my ticket I completely expect my money back. Absolute joke.
"Hello smmanchikanti, of course we can help you with your booking confirmation. Please send a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with your booking code and we will check the ticket status to send you all the information about it asap. Regards"
"hi, i agree with all the negtive reviews about travel2be. made a reservation through skyscanner.com, and it went through. but didn't get a second confirmation email in a reasonable amount of time. called to cancel, they charged me 30 euro for cancelling in the first 24 hours. as i understand it in the US you can cancel your reservation within 24 hrs at no cost. stay away from this company."
"Hi Andrew, could you please send us all the details to customer.service@travel2be.com? We would like to understand all your case. Regards"
"Andrew K: < as i understand it in the US you can cancel your reservation within 24 hrs at no cost.>Your understanding is at fault. The 24 hour rule is when you do the sensible thing and book directly with the airline, not through a rubbish (or non-rubbish for that matter) agent. Then you are bound by the Terms and Conditions you agreed to when sending in your booking request."
"I bought one-way airline tickets from Da Nang, Vietnam to Ho Chi Minh City through Travel2be, and about a month later, I checked the online status and found that the flight had been cancelled. I called Travel2be, and they contacted the airline and we agreed on a similar flight on the same day as the original tickets, at no change in the fare. All this took about a week, but we got everything straightened out plenty of time before the flight. Everyone I interacted with at Travel2be was really nice.Bottom line - my experience with Travel2be was positive. Despite the airline cancelling the flight, Travel2be found me another flight at the same price for the original date, with only a bit of delay.Edited: 3 years ago "
"It's nice to read of a positive experience, but had you booked direct with the airline I'm sure you would have had a very good result in far less time than it took Travel2be!"
OP GOOD for u ! U Sussed it before u booked! Well done! Lynne
It has been a pleasure to help you. Have a good trip.
"I tried to book direct flights from Vancouver to LA with travel2be, they tried to book me on flights from Vancouver to Ontario through Seattle.They took my money straight away, then they let the booking sit in their very confusing system as Cancelled, then they finally refunded after I called them."
Hi gamadio. Sometimes airlines change or cancel their flight plans and our agents inform passengers about the possible alternatives. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com and we will inform you about the latest flight schedule and the alternatives. Regards
"I also have never had such bad experience with a travel company. I had purchased my ticket to Europe from JFK and wanted make changes and ask their help to respond my need. I keep calling past 2 days and some lunatic from Madrid office wont even talk to me because their lack of professionalism. This site is the worst air ticket search site on the entire internet world. I am also blaming and will write bad reviews for skyscanner.com for having me to be diverted to this low , lack of customer service , looser people!!What a waste of money and time! Hope you will get your karma hit you guys at travel2be!!"
"HI, please send us your changes requests to customer.service@travelgenio.com. Sometimes the ticket policy accepted during the booking process and the airline policy do not accept changes and maybe that is why you received a negative response. Please send us the details and we will contact you. REgards"
"""skyscanner.com for having me to be diverted""Don't talk rubbish. You selected this mob of your own volition."
"Thanks for the ""heads up"" , I am about to book my flight with them until I read Trip Advisor forum."
Sorry??Do you have a point to your reply or are you just trolling?Quite interested to know...
"SSS, it helps if you add a post # or name as we don't have a clue who you are replying to."
"I recently tried to book a flight on Travel2Be and my card was refused - so I booked via another means. 2 months later I noticed that my card was actually charged by Travel2Be a total of Euros 143.37. I called them to ask for a refund and I was told it is their policy and they split charge, so they put an amount in for the credit card fees first, then raise a second transaction for the flight and their mark up. If the second transaction is refused for a fraud alert or limit issue etc, they claim they can keep the first amount as an ""admin"" fee. Notwithstanding that you have no idea that a transaction has actually occured and you have ""part paid"" for the flight.I strongly recommend no one to use Travel2Be or Travelgenio.com. In addition the staff are incredibly rude and simply put the phone down on you, if you start asking for details."
"Hello Nadim, of course we can help you with your booking payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"just keeping my fingers crossed, that i do not experience such a problem. i have just booked 2 journeys via travel2be. hope to have a good experience."
Continually monitor the booking on the website for the airline to avoid any nasty surprises.
"Hi Akshaye41, if you need support please do not hesitate in contacting us through customer.service@travel2be.com and we will help you. Regards"
"DO NOT use this websites please !!!!!I am still waiting for a refund as they kept asking for more money , they say the price of the flight has changed, even when the transaction had gone through !please do not use it , they are such a scam , I am out of money because of them."
I am still waiting for my refund which I decided to not go through with the transaction on the same day ! the booking code is 6528466
Hello Lupe;You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration.
"LupeDelune, have you received the promised message yet?"
Great advice. I have just booked direct with the airline. Many thanks
This website is scam. I bough open ticket for my mom. So i tried to change the ticket. i did contact with this travel agency customer service and she refuse to talk to me. first she said yes we can change you ticket but then she ask me additional which same as the original price of the ticket So i contacted with the airline directly which i find out ticket is not open ticket. Basically they charged me extra open ticket price for no reason and give me misleading info. This is really not ethical. I have contacted with consumer complain as well as try to find out how to shut down this website.... It is illegal to give misleading information about product and charge extra for non existing product... i'll not rest till this website is shut down so other people won't get scammed by this service ever again.
"Hi Manduukihai, please send us all the info to customer.service@travel2be.com to check your ticket changes allowances and we will contact you asap. Regards"
"Experienced similar deceptions. The price changes on the payment page. I didn't pay attention and got trapped. Then the ticket I bought was an open ticket, which charged me more than the airline anyway. I called, before the departure, to change the date. I was told the departure can't be changed and the return can't be changed before the departure. But the return is open and can be changed any time after the departure. A few months before the return, I called to change my return ticket. The representative said it's open, but I can only change before the departure and there's nothing he can do. I said this wasn't the company told me before and he simply hung up the phone. Probably he thinks there's nothing anyone can do to the company since there's no physical address on their webpage and god knows where he's hiding. The company and all its dealings are probably illegal."
"Hi Palwang, please send us all the details to customer.service@travelgenio.com as we would like to check your incidence in detail and contact you. REgards"
"#82 you are not alone, they are really bad scammers, and I blame Skyscanner for displaying them, because they have the power to not to.#83 please stop your messages you are not here to help, you haven't helped nobody.I blame Skyscanner for giving these scammers a platform to ruin people travels"
"#80 I think we should bring this matter to twitter and blame both Travel2be and Skyscanner for giving these guys a platform to rip off decent people.There are too many complaints about them, it's ridiculous that they still do business."

I've reported the last two posts as duplicates as they also appear on another thread.
"I booked a flight in Oct for my wife to fly to China on 26/12/16. Then two weeks ago I called them to buy a baby ticket for my son who is only 13 months old on the same flight. They said OK and I paid with credit card. But I still haven't received the e ticket for the baby. Every time I called them, they assured me that they would send me the e ticket for my son in a day or in hours. But still nothing has happened. how hard is it to get baby ticket without a seat? I feel they are not honest with me. As the flight date gets closer, I am getting more worried. The thing is they keep promising me and keep being proved their promise is nothing. I will keep updating my post and share my experience with you guys.Edited: 3 years ago "
"HI Andyzheng2016, please send us the details to customer.service@travel2be.com to find out why you have not received the ticket for your son. We will get in touch with you asap. Regards"
"I called them on Friday. Not surprisingly, the ticket was still not confirmed. It is a crazy experience. It wasted me hours of time calling them. I had enough and asked them to cancel the reservation. Then I called the airline for help directly. The airline charged me much cheaper than Travel2be and confirmed the baby ticket straight away. Hope Traval2be will process the refund without any drama."
"Hi, please tell us the booking reference to find out what happened. Regards"
"I thought i was the only one facing bad service here! But to my surprise, it's such a global customer service! It's not just about the money, it's actually about the terrible terrible customer service and unclear playing indirect emails! Terrible!"
"Hi Nada, we feel sorry for your comment. Could you please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all the info regarding your case? We will contact you asap"
DO NOT USE Travel2be!This has been the worst experience I have every had to deal with. After booking a round trip flight to Costa Rica- receiving conformation and booking codes for both inbound and outbound flights; I found my self stranded in a country I knew no one and no way home. Travel2be booked my outbound ticket but never booked my return flight. I was then forced to purchase a one way ticket home for 6x the amount I had already paid Travel2be.This is the WORST travel booking company I have worked withDO NOT USE!
"Hello Sara, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"I don't think Sara wants help with a booking. She seems to have already flown, and been left without a flight home."
"Very upset and angry at myself. An experienced traveler and user of various email sites I have just been 'burned' by Travel2be and I don't know if the flights I have purchased with hidden extra costs is a real ticket. The phone numbers provided when I realised the issue would not connect. The online feedback form would not submit. I have found reference to an email address through this forum and am waiting to see if I get a reply. Unfortunately I trusted Skyscanner, having had success using their links before. Anyone doing the right thing and checking them out before you book beware.To Travel2be: if you are checking this site as I notice you have replied to a few others I would greatly appreciate you replying to the email I have just sent."
"Hi Aussie_travel_mum, please send us all the info regarding your booking to customer.service@travel2be.com and our team will check all the charges during the booking process and contact you bac with the info. Regards"
"The p[oster said they have just sent you an email. Do the Travelgenio reps actually read what people write at all? I find it very amusing when someone says that they are thinking of taking legal action and you reply that you will be happy to help them with their booking!Long may you continue, because you really aren't helping yourselves, lol!"
We have not received a mail we can identify with this case in our inbox. We are asking to follow the mail given (customer.service@travelgenio.com) in order to make the follow to the case from our department. As soon as we receive the mail with all the info we will get in touch with her. Thanks for your concern. Regards
Sandra from the 'Advance Support Department' has responded to say the issue is being looked into. I am interested to see how long this will take and what the outcome will be. I have photo evidence (screen shots) to prove my claims.
So presumably they had received an email that they could identify and respond to despite the claim made by the rep in post 104?This gets funnier and funnier. Their attempts at damage limitation are having the opposite effect.
We are in touch with the customer. Thanks in advance
I'm pleased to report that within 48hours of my initial query I had received several emails from Travel2be and an agreement to refund the 'surprise' fee that appeared before I realised it had been charged. This morning I checked my credit card statement and the funds have appeared. There is no denying that the online booking system is confusing and misleading but I am satisfied with the response received and action taken to resolve the issue.I will certainly be much more careful and risk averse for future online bookings.
Many thanks for your review Aussi_travel_mum. When there is an incidence with any of our customers we try to solve the situation asap and in the best way. Best regards
"This is a website designed to deceive. Initial costs didn't match those shown on Skyscanner, then additional costs (AUD $222!) appeared for using anything other than Maestro to pay with. Then to top it off, having decided to grudgingly accept those extra costs (because the new total price still looked ok) and having entered my credit card details and hit 'Pay' it then comes up and says 'Flights unavailable'! I'm now pretty convinced this is a scam to capture my credit card details. At best its a very sneaky website. Avoid. And Skyscanner - you are trashing your own brand by allowing this company to appear in your search results. Get rid of them."
"Hi Gregah, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"Skyscanner aren't trashing their own brand. If they didn't take money from people like Travelgenio, they wouldn't have a brand in the first place."
"Don't book with this company. Tried to change a flight for one of my passengers, and at first they told me no problem, and there would be a small fee of $170 euros. He put me on hold, came back and said he couldn't do it right now, because he had to wait for the conformation from the airlines, and I would have to call back the next day. Called back the next day and he said that over night things had changed and now the change was going to cost me $1000 euros to make the change. He said that's how much the ticket was. As I was speaking to him I pulled up the same flight he was referring to and the cost of the flight was $350 usd. They were trying to scam me, basically steal money from me. Also would not refund me any portion of the original ticket. They would not give any reason why the ticket was $1000 euros, when it said it was $350 usd."
"Hi Mike, name changes have to follow the airline guidelines and authorisation and follow their own rules and penalties too. That is why we ask our customers to introduce during the booking process the information as in the docs they will need for travelling. As intermediaries of the airlines, we just process the request and inform you about what they ask us for making the changes. If you need further info, we will be pleased to inform you about everything in customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
"It wasn't a name change, it was a flight change. Also, I did call the airlines. They charge $200 for flight changes. You were trying to charge me over $1200 usd (1000 euros) Break down the penalties for me that add up to $1200 usd."
"The first day he checked with the airlines and he told me the fee was $170 euros, but thought maybe we can scam this guy by telling him to call back the next day and lie about the fees. That is what happened."
"Dear Mike, as told, we follow the airline guidelines for any change on the bookings as they are not always allowed. Take into account that they are the owners of the tickets, we are just the intermediaries and we cannot do it on our own without their authorisation. If you need further info or have any doubt about the info given, do not hesitate in contacting in our mail"
"If you're the type of person that is employed by Travel2be than I now understand what's going on. Do you understand that I have talked to the airlines and they have no other restrictions. They told me that all you people had to do is call them and the fee would have $200 usd, That's all it would have cost to change the flight. You can try to run around the issue, but your company tried to rip me off for $1000. I will continue to write all the reviews I can, on as many travel sites that I can to expose you. It's impossible for the fee to jump from $170 to $1000 in one day. Also, you refuse to give me info as to the break down of the fees.Edited: 3 years ago "
"Dear Mike, could you please tell us your booking code to find out all the process for the changes you wanted to arrange? You can also send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com and we will check it once more before contacting you. REgards"
I also tried to book a seat thorugh Travel2be and got the exact same message as Gregah. Entered all my credit card and personal info and at then end got the booking unavailable message. I am hoping it is not a scam to get my credit crad info.
"Hi Nasir, please send us all the info to customer.service@travel2be.com and we will check why you had such problems in the payment process. Best regards"
I am a victim of this websites fraudulent practices also. I booked through skyscanne for dates March 2017 and my ticket was issued for August. When i arrived at the airport i was not able to fly due to incorrect dates. When i contacted Travel2B they hung up on me twice and refused t ok credit my flight. I am contacting consumer affairs and the ombudsman to have my fair refunded.
"Hi Nikkisheds, could you please send us a mail with all the info to customer.service@travel2be.com? We will check what happened during the booking process and the dates that were confirmed and inform you about the possibilities for the changes you need. regards"
"Nikkisheds doesn't appear to want any changes. I read her post as wanting money back because Travel2Be made a mess of the booking. I don't know if that's true or not, but Nikkisheds says they were unable to fly at all."
"I booked through travel2be and advise anyone else not to. We needed change our booking and you simply could not find an email address for them online. It doesn't exist. Then when you try to phone them, all goes well until you are repeatedly cut off. As I write, I'm on my fifth phone call to them. I kept getting cut off on their Spanish number. Australian number seemed to answer but nobody spoke. U.S. number I spoke to a rep but it cut out before we'd finished. Nobody calls you back. I did fill out a form online twice but nobody answered it. Beware of this company! Go straight to the airline to make your booking after you've found the flight you want on skyscanner."
"Hi Barbara, you can contact us in customer.service@travel2be.com and we will be pleased to give you support. Please send us all your booking info and your needs and we will contact you asap. REgards"
This company is a crooked money grab. Don't book with them ever. my daughter had to change hers and her sisters flights to NB from fort mcmurray because no flights flying out of fort mcmurray due to the wildfires after May 3 evacuation. This company wouldn't help her change flights to reroute out of edmonton so she paid direct through westjet to book a new flight herself as we had a reunion to attend . Later when she returned home and after several arguments with the staff she finally got a credit for the flights but now trying to use the credit is a huge hassle and they keep telling her she needs to pay addl fees to change flights even though the new flights are cheaper by about 400. Such a scam company. Obviously all the other bad reviews are true. Save yourself the hassle and book direct with the airlines. Trust me they are not going to save you any money!!! scumbags!!!Edited: 3 years ago 
"Hi Colleen, could you please send us all the information regarding your daughter's booking to customer.service@travelgenio.com? We will check what were the airline guidelines for your concrete case and we will inform them about the credit flights. Regards"
"Colleen, please come back and tell us if Travelgenio actually manage to help you or not. My money is on the latter, but I'd be delighted to be wrong."
"ca.travel2be.com WARNINGI book a lot of tickets for friends and without going into a lot of detail I'd advise people to steer clear of this site, their advertising practices are really shady and all these extra fees seem to appear out of nowhere. Skyscanner does link to them.For example they hung up on me twice when I asked if luggage is included and what the fee for checked luggage is. I did manage to get that they charge a $20 admin fee for luggage on top of what the airline charges. Also your price will go up by $20 at checkout if you don't choose the maestro card as your payment option. ETC."
Hello Omaar;Send us all the details to this email address: customer.service@travel2be.com Our team will review the incident and we will keep you informed.Best regards.
"I just sent you all the details you need. I have contacted skyscanner as I use their site a lot and I like to tell people they can have confidence in skyscanner but based upon your dishonest practices I cannot tell people skyscanner only links to legit sites.I called your number twice today, only to be hung up on both times when I asked about baggage fees. The information provided in your FAQ regarding baggage fees is inaccurate in some places and out of date in others.Companies like yours give legit online booking sites a bad name. Boo!"
If you want the details why don't you copy these messages and send them to that email yourself
"I agree 100 percent. They post all these responses pretending if you email them they will do something but they don't, and don't change their deceptive practices. I am surprised VISA still does business with them."
"Omar,It is considered to be spamming the forums, to dredge up all threads on some skonky 3rd party agent, and post pretty much the same to each.I would not be surprised if some of your posts are removed.Sorry that you had a bad experience, but one post, in one thread is enough.Hunt"
"The more people who know the better. IF you want to be negative about that and more people get scammed, that's up to you. If it makes you feel like an important person to call others spammers then I guess you can feel important for today now.I made one post, and replied to two people. That's hardly spam. Unless you like to discourage conversation.Anyway you really take away from this experience not add to it. Too bad. TripAdvisor is made good by its users not by negative nancies.Edited: 3 years ago "
It is also too bad that all of the other warning messages that other people have posted about this mob were not read by you before throwing away money. You have been a TA member for over three years so you have no sympathy from me.
"Omaar, without identifying your booking we cannot check it. Please send us a mail to the mail address told or tell us your booking number. We will get in touch with you. Regards"
"I searched an international flight through Skyscanner and then booked through Travel2Be (advised later by Visa that this is AKA Travelgenio). Total costs displayed was $874 however once I clicked for payment this changed to $933. Once the travel itinerary was e mailed the ticket indicated no baggage included. Though the site advertised insurance, seat, food ... selection no mention of baggage was made. Phoned to complain and seek redress. I was put on hold by a pleasant call taker and after more than 1/2 hour of her ""looking into it"" the call disconnected. Every return call led to the same scenero of being on hold for over 1/2 hour and the call then disconnecting. This is a scam site. It may be good for identifying a flight but nothing more. Book through a reputable agent or the airline direct.I'm 62 years old and not unsophisticated to booking flights. I really should have known better !!!"
"Hi 1werner, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"I have booked through Travel2be and paid for their special service only to find out that the only thing special about it was that it was not special at all. It says that if you pay for this service you will be able to book your seats, add special luggage, book in flight meals and so much more. This is a scam DO NOT BUY IT!!! All this service offers you is the opportunity to book these things at further cost something that you can do direct with the airline anyway. Total SCAM"
"Hi, the service pack terms and conditions are shown during the Booking process. If you need further info please contact us through customer.service@travel2be.com. regards"
It is not clear that you are not paying for seats and baggage; it is worded to make it sound as though you are paying for seat allocation and baggage etc..TOTAL SCAM!!!
"Hi Sharon, if you need any further info regarding the terms and conditions of the service pack please do not hesitate in contacting us in the mail told. REgards"
"Travel2be will say they have a seat for you, take your money and then call back two-three days later/before your flight to let you know that ""there was a miscomunication in the system and that we dont have any seats for you anymore"". Their service is unprofessional, they´re rude and don't care about the costumers!DO NOT US THIS TRAVEL AGENT !!!!"
"Hi Edvuard, could you please send us all the info to customer.service@travel2be.com? We would like to check what happened and contact you asap. Regards"
"After my card was declined they asked me to pay 55EUR more. I paid, but then they told me I didn't pay it in 1 hour after receive the email and charged me $149 more. The worst agency I ever used!"
"Hi Mudryi, of course we can help you with your booking doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will tell you the booking status. Regards"
I don't think they have any doubts. They have described you as the worst agency they have ever used. That sounds like they are pretty convinced to me.
"I just booked a flight with travel2be and was surprised when my total went from 1444.00 to 1534.00 - I did chose to pay the extra 31.00 to be able to chose a window seat - which is annoying in itself - but a necessity for a 14hr flight - when I tried calling them - i sat on hold for over 10 minutes, then was disconnected - so called back and was informed that the charge for choosing a seat was 31.00 PER LEG of the trip - so every time i changed planes... another 31.00... this was not stated in the offer of the service, and not explained when booking - it still only showed as a 31.00 charge on the total (not 31.00 x 4). VERY POOR. Their solution to my discontent was to offer to charge me 30 euros to cancel the booking. for-warned is for-armed.... I will know just to pay a bit more to go with a reputable company like flight centre next time."
"Flight Centre are not travel agents - they are sales persons. Just book with the airline direct and all problems, real and potential, will be gone."
"<<when I tried calling them - i sat on hold for over 10 minutes, then was disconnected - so called back and was informed that the charge for choosing a seat was 31.00 PER LEG of the trip>>OK, you booked the cheapest tickets, with the cheapest organization, that you could find, and are now whining about poor customer service. Did you expect more for ultra-cheap?If so, you will be hard-pressed to find that.Good luck,Hunt"

"OMG PLEASE HELP. I fly out of Adelaide on July 14 this Friday. I need urgent help. I purchased a ticket 2 weeks ago: Adelaide - Melbourne - Beijing - Mongolia I could not insert my middle name on the booking form on the website. I have spoken to Air China who have confirmed I NEED my middle name in the itinerary Eticket. ETicket and Passport have to match. I have tried alot of times to sort this out with Travel2be, they are not interested, they do not want to know and they will not sort it out. I fly out of Adelaide in 48 hours on Friday 14 July. What a disgrace. Travel2be admit that on their website there wasn't enough space to put a middle name, but they have since changed this so anyone now can include their middle name. HELP PLEASE what can I do now, otherwise I wont be able to fly out. All I want is them to amend the flight eticket and email it out to me, with my FULL name including my middle name. I have even sent them a copy of my passport confirming I have a middle name, but they wont do anything to change the eticket for me. How hard is this to do. I really dont understand why Travel2be wont help me"
"You havent sorted this out for me. You wont change the ETicket to include my middle name. I need URGENTLY my ticket changed 'Free of Charge' to include my middle name.You say it cant be done. Air China say they wont do it. You need to. You HAVE a copy of my passport which I emailed to you. I fly out of Australia in less than 48 hours. I NEED an ETicket with my full name, including my middle name in. Your company admitted now to changing the website so people can include their middle name. I NEED THIS SORTED NOW PLEASE with a new ETicket emailed to my email address. This is a disgrace. I paid for the ticket immediately - why cant you sort it out.Edited: 3 years ago "

"Dear Taylorfamily4, our team is informing you about the name changes policy both of your ticket and the airline allowances. Please follow the mail chain in order to have further info if you need it. As Airlines limit the characters number, but there are always some ways to make the booking in order not to have any problems while traveling. That is why during the booking process we ask to include the names as in the docs needed to travel. Regards"
"I have booked the flight through the Travel2be at 08/07/2017 and have got a confirmation letter but a couple hours late I had a letter from Travelgenio that the airline was not able to confirm my booking. The Travelgenio was offering me next option: Alternatively, we have made a new booking with the same fare and the following flights:BA 883 24AUG KBPLHR 1425 1605  CX 250 24AUG LHRHKG 1820 #1315  CX 103 25AUG HKGBNE 2120 #0950  CX 156 20FEB BNEHKG 0045 0725  CX 239 20FEB HKGLHR 1205 1720  BA 882 21FEB LHRKBP 0755 1310This letters and numbers mean nothing to me and I decided to contact Travel2be but an australian phone number on the website belongs to the person who has no idear about this site. I tried to call on the international number in Madrid but I had an answer only from the answering machine. The letter said that ""We will now send you an e-mail with detailed information of the new itinerary.Please verify that all the information is correct and let us know as soon as possible if you accept this new booking. Otherwise, we will cancel the booking and refund the amount paid.IMPORTANT: Bear in mind that the fare is only guaranteed for today (11:59P GMT+2), so we suggest you make the payment as early as possible to avoid any change in your booking.Please do not hesitate to contact us again if you require further information.Thank you for booking with Travelgenio. We wish you a pleasant trip."" Since that I had no information about my flight and money. And Yes I did send my letter to the address customer.service@travelgenio.com. I have a big hope to have my money which is 2089AUD back"
Avoid at all costs.Scam- do not use this site not only do they gauge you with ticket prices and last minute fare increases upon service- customer service is shocking with poor English skills and seem to lack the access to any information about your booking.Terrible- disappointing end to a trip.Edited: 3 years ago 
"Hi Annie, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
>>>poor English skills<<<I think the reply to you here reflects this.
"update to my posts in February 2017:Following my complaint the variance between what I thought I was paying and what was charged was credited back to my card. However, I remained nervous about whether the flights were genuine. I'm relieved to say that we had seats on the plane when we arrived at Split airport last month. The stress and drama related to this booking was ridiculous and Travel2be should be avoided at all costs."
"HI Aussie, thanks for your comment. We feel glad to know you had a great trip with our booking. Regards"

"Hilarious! Aussie travel mum is complaining about Travel2be and saying never to use them and the reply from them is ""Glad you had a great trip"". Travelgenio......She did NOT say she had a good trip!!!! READ the posts before putting your standard reply on screen!!! You are just making yourselves look even worse."
"Yes, but at least they had seats!"
Mein Flug wurde gestrichen im tiefsten Afrika und offensichtlich hatte die Airline das nicht so reflektiert wie sich Travel2be gewohnt ist und die Hotline hat darauf bestanden während ich den ganzen Tag niedergeschmettert und verschwitzt am Flughafen auf Umbuchung oder Stornierung wartete dass der Flug normal gegangen sei und ich ein no-show sei....WORST.CUSTOMER.SERVICE.EVER!!!!
"Hallo Simone, natürlich können wir Ihnen bei Ihrer Buchung behilflich sein. Bitte senden Sie uns eine E-Mail an customer.service@travel2be.com mit allen Ihren Fragen und wir setzten uns mit Ihnen umgehend in Verbindung. Mit freundlichen Grüßen"
"And your contributions today are, kevasaraj?"
"Thanks for the reply, not sure how it relates to my comment though. In your defense, after a more than deplorable and absolutely unacceptable experience with the hotline number in Switzerland a colleague from your Madrid-based number actually handled my issue and was very professional and polite, only hope the reimbursement will actually arrive."
You were smart enough and quick enough to catch it and did the right thing going to the carrier.
"Good Morning Simone, thanks for your comment. We keep at your disposal for further info regarding your remboursement if needed. You can always reach us through customer.service@travel2be.com. Regards"
Travel2be is a ripoff site beware of travel2be they are crims

Travel2be, if you would like to rectify your ERROR I would be grateful, if not my reviews will keep coming!!!"

I wish I have read all the negative reviews before booking flight from Trave2be. My booking was been cancelled without even informing me. Now I am asking for refund but they don't have my booking details with them. They asked me to wait 24 hrs so that they can retrieve my booking. I don't know if they will refund or not. They are very rude and infact they hung up on me.Bit worried as ticket was over 700AUD
"Hi sim424, of course we can help you with your booking changes. Sometimes airlines change their flight plans and our agents inform passengers about the possible alternatives. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com and we will inform you about the latest flight schedule and the alternatives they gave us in case they don't suit your plans. Regards"
"DO NOT USE THIS SITE !!!! I have not even reached my travel date and I am so frustrated and all out disappointed in the lack of customer service and respect. It is extremely difficult to communicate with the agency. Despite that I paid an extra 20euro for the service package. You can only contact by phone, which would have pleased me however when I finally got through I was hung up on when I pushed the agent as to why they couldn't help me. I am always very polite to customer service phone agents, and it's possible he was not being deceitful, although from everything I've gather that's all this website is. Regardless someone who is paying a fee to be able to contact the booking agency, a fee to pay with a normal debit card, a fee for a bAD travel insurance should not be hung up on. they would not be flexible at all and the woman seemed perfectly fine with that idea that i might have to cancel my whole booking with them. because despite me 90euro insurance policy, they'll still get 15%. this is a bad business. DO NOT USE THIS SITE"
So what do you actually want them to be flexible with Grace? Often people say service is bad when they get told something they don't want to hear - like they have a non refundable ticket that doesn't allow for changes to be made.
"Hi Grace, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"

"""I HAVE CALLED travel2be to reschedule my flight because of medical conditions""---Did you have travel insurance Ronny?"

Thanks for rating your experience with us Khadijeh. Our goal is our customers satisfaction. Regards
My own problem is a flight from Panama to Abuja Nigeria. I bought the ticket and paid since morning. Its 8 hours now and they are still processing the payment. I havent been billed on my credit card yet. But I was sent the reservation code. Should I book another flight or wait for this very one? Also wont I miss the chance of getting the ticket?
"Hi Ses I, of course we can help you with your booking confirmation. Please send a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will check the ticket status to send you all the information about it asap. Regards"
"I made a reservation with Travel2Be of a flight Lisbon-Hong Kong and the service was terrible. First, the total price was not the one they show first; secondly, I tried to call them and they gave me the option of speaking in Portuguese but the lady who answered the call didn't speak Portuguese. I explained my problem in english but the phone call went down. I tried to call several times after but they made me wait too much time and then the phone call went down and no one answered.They sold me a plane ticket with two airlines with no connection between them and the stop over was 1 hour in Beijing..luckily I managed to get the second flight, with a lot of stress, but if I didn't... I doubt the second airline would put me in another flight...I do not recommend Travel2Be! Be careful because cheap can be (very) expensive!!"
Hi Mariana of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards
"Thank you I but I needed your help before my flight and for this reason I spent a lot of money calling you several times in the afternoon (the day before the departure to HK) with no result. I am glad I did not need your help during my trip because, for sure, I would spend lots of money in roaming and you wouldn't help me.I returned this morning from my trip and it was the first and last time I booked a flight with you because your service is terrible."
"WARNING!!!!Who are you ,people? What type of business are you doing? I bought a ticket from Mendoza to Buenos Aires, received the confirmation of my purchase and viola I am at the airport to check in and the crew says I can't fly because my ticket was cancelled by the travel2b!!!! The ticket shop of the Aerolineas Argentina told me that it was cancelled a half an hour before I arrived in the airport of Mendoza. My flight was today in the morning 8:40 am and I arrived 7:20 to check in. Basically, I ended up paying 400 USD for a journey that usually doesn't exceed 150USD and huge amount of head ache and stress! In all the cases the customer needs to receive such an information and explaination.Shame on you and type of business you are doing! I am gonna take this further!"

"Hi Rozanne,please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"rozane, do let us know how quick 'asap' actually is."
Her petition was already dealt and our customer has been informed about it. Thanks for your interest. Regards
"I would rather hear from rozane, to be perfectly honest."
"Hi, I have made a booking via travel2be from Bergen to Tromso (Norway) for which I have received all booking Id and confirmations from the website via mail. Now when I am contacting the airlines they say they dont have any such bookings'. I tried reaching the customer care, but no one picks up. Also I have mailed the customer care on the emails provided on the forum and no on replies. This is such pathetic service and now i'll have to file a complaint with the law authorities if this is not resolved.Anish"
"Hi Anish, of course we can help you with your online check in. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with your booking code and we will tell you all the steps to succeed with the check in online in the airline web. Regards"
I have already sent a mail with all the details on both the emails. There has been no reply. How much time will this take?
You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration.
"Please keep us updated, Anish."
"Hi All,I got a reply from the customer services team, and they have stated that the ticket is confirmed. The reason why the airlines do not see the confirmation is cause it is done via travel agent. Travelgenio provided me with another confirmation number which the airline confirms along with the ticket number. The flight details were also confirmed by the airlines. The airlines however have not confirmed the name on the ticket. I guess I'll have to wait till I check in to see. Hope everything turns out fine. will keep you'll posted. But now I at least have the comfort of the correct booking and ticket number.Regards,Anish"
"Hi, I was contacted by support. have confirmed the flight but not the name. will come to know when I check in. Too much stress for a small flight. should be easier"
"Totally deceptive website!! Skyscanner.net is also not reputable. They directed me to this site for a flight to Kenya (Non-stop from New York). Initial price: $850. Then clicked on the link to travel2be.com. Fare changed to $890. THEN after inputting my name, etc, they asked for $256.00 PER BAG EACH way....Total cost??? %1404.97 with a 'discount of $27.39) BE WARNED!! FRAUD!!"
SkyScanner did not direct you anywhere - you chose to click on Tavel2be.
"Hi NYcruiser914, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"There is nothing at all disreputable about Skyscanner. They simply display a list of results and you, yes you, choose which ones to follow up. As Frommy says, you are not sent anywhere against your will."
"Very dissapointment with travel2be also known as travelgenio. I made a booking on Sunday from their homepage with no success. I provided correct information but their internet doesn't successfully finish the payment process. unless its some sort of scam, I dont understand the company's problem or their internet platform.I contacted their office severally and all the time got different information. I called on sunday and my call was pending for over 10 mins without being answered even though their homepage indicated 24/7 availability. I called 5 times on mondays and the first Gentle man was friendly and wanted to assist but then he mentioned that I needed to have a credit card with me but since I didn't have it with me and couldnt access at that time, he adviced to call back when I have one. I called later and the second Gentleman asked me to wait as he speaks to the supervisor and unfortunately that took ages untill i was automatically disconnected with the system. the third time it was a lady who received my phone and she told me that there's nothing that can be done and I should book again. the fourth person was a lady and she said that she's been able to retrieve my pending booking and that she will be sending me a link to address  the issue. I havent rceived any email till now. The fifth gentleman, mentioned that there was nothing he could do to help in this case and he acknowledged that the problem was with their system and it wasn't from my side but there is nothing he could do since they are limited (a call centre).I spent time to do the booking and atleast the company should recognize this, if their system is not functioning, then I the company should be in a position to assist the client with their booking completion and transactions. I even doubt the service packet you selling to the clients eg for customer care. My opinion, you are not in the capacity to offer what you cannot not provide. Asking the client to revisit your homepage and rebook isn't a solution especially when its your fault. And for that, no one needs to pay extra to be told that. calling 5+ times is not a joke, the cost, the time and the nerves involved."
"It's a booking site. And not aparticularly stunning one. They can't afford to invest in fantastic customer service and excellent support functions, because they need to conentrate on revenue generating activities in order to make a profit and stay in business. That will always be their priority.Remember that no booking site is a anything like a full service travel agent, and have realistic expectations."
"Hi Maariieepa, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"TRAVEL2BE and TRAVELGENIO are fraud and the worst online ticketing company. Please DO NOT USE THEM. They don't answer emails, they hang up on you when you call and they steal your money, as they sell tickets that are cancelled and promise a refund that never comes. I have been waiting for my refund for 1 year now. And they told me ""it takes time"" This conpany IS A JOKE, IT IS A FRAUD."
You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours with the update of your refund. Thank you for your collaboration.
Did you receive the email in the end?
"I booked through travel2be and advise anyone else not to. We needed change our booking and simply could not find an email address for them online. It doesn't exist. Then when you try to phone them, all goes well until you are repeatedly cut off. When I finally get hold to one of the rep but it cut out before we'd finished. I did send email twice to customer.service@travel2be.com but nobody respond to me.Beware of this company! Go straight to the airline to make your booking after you've found the flight you want on skyscanner."
"Hi Evelyn, mails are replied within the following 24 hours after reception. You will receive all the info regarding your petition asap. Regards"
I recently helped a friend try and resolve a booking issue with these people and I have never had a more terrible experience anywhere. The fact that we had to stay up until midnight AU time to communicate with them because they are in Madrid is beyond me and even then we had trouble calling the number which would drop out all the time. The email communications were confusing to say the least with the information being relayed to us changing with every response from having to pay an additional $500 because there were no economy seats left which was incorrect because we called the airline directly the very next day and were able to book an economy seat no problem. DO NOT BOOK WITH TRAVEL2BE UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO LOSE SLEEP AND YOUR MONEY.
"Hi Lisa G, of course we can help you with your booking and reviewing what happened. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"Lisa G had a terrible experience. I don't think they want any help from you at this stage, but I could be wrong.Still, it's easy enough to find out where a company is based before handing over money. I hope your friend can learn from this, Lisa."
"Very disappointed by travel2be. Booked two tickets to NYC in July 2017. Tickets were deducted from my credit card. Throughout the year, received updates from TAP about our flight. The day before the flight, April 2018, we received an online check-in email. But not working. We called TAP and they say we have a reservation, but no ticket issued. Called travel2be, they say someone had called 24h after our booking in July to cancel. Never got an email about a cancellation or reimbursement. Know for sure no one called. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, they hung up on me mid sentence. Had to book two new flights for double the price a day before departure to my daughter's wedding. Money was taken, no tickets issued, no one will answer where the money went. Won't go through them anymore, no sense of service or communication."
"Hi Allison V, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"We all know you can't do anything, and won;t even if you can. Allison hasn't got any doubts. They have explained what happened. The tickets were never issued by the airline, adn Allison was told they had been cancelled by someone at Travel2Be. You aren't fooling anyone with these template messages!"
I had much much worse experience with them. They quoted something very different amount to me and charged me another amount on my credit card. Even their invoice had their quoted amount. When I tried to dispute the charges they cancelled my tickets and charged me a heavy cancellation fee. Booking through them has been biggest travel mistake I ever madeThe customer service agent was rude and these guys can't be trusted.
"Hi Rohankothari, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
DANGEROUS WEBSITE TRAVEL2BE.COMDO NOT PURCHASE TICKETS FROM THIS WEBSITE.I live in Australia and i purchased a ticket for my son & me to travel to Bangkok to Sydney over a month before travelling by using Skyscanner.com.au and then getting redirected to travel2be.com.auOn the travel day at the Emirates counter i was told the ticket is not valid and has been voided by the travel agent. I tried contacting travel2be.com.au but couldnt get through but boarding was closing in 10 minutes. I couldnt afford to miss the flight so i bought two new tickets at the counter at the highest price. When i got back to Sydney i tried to call them but they just hanged up on me twice. This is an Spain website so DONT GET FOOLED LIKE ME.
"You went to Skyscanner, saw some results, and chose to go to Travel2Be. Skyscanner did not send you there, despite your choice of wording which implies that you had no say in what happened.In future, don;t trust any site simply because it pays to advertise on a site like Skyscanner. Or Kayak, Tripadvisor etc for that matter. It is absolutely no guarantee of reliability or quality."
Hi Abi P of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards
"DO NOT USE TRAVEL2BE AUSTRALIA OR YOU WILL BE RIPPED OFF!!!! So frustrated by fraudulent practice being used by this travel company. I picked some flights and was redirected to the travel2be site from Skyscanner.After I checked the price the seconds before entering my credit card details to the moment before I clicked “purchase” button the price had increased by AU$139!! So, in fact, they quietly charged me more than they initially declared! There were no any notifications or whatsoever – just surprisingly increased price!!!Such a scam! Definitely do not use this website. Travel2be, if you would like to rectify your fraudulent practice I would be grateful, if not my reviews will keep coming across other travel sites!!!"
"G'day serge,You were not redirected to this mob - you chose them willingly and were prepared to throw money at a company you have never heard of in Spain without doing any research. More fool you, and it is not a scam, just a rip-off."
"Hi serge437, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
I sent all the booking details tto the provided email : customer.service@travel2be.com 5 hours ago. Still no any reply.

DO YOU CHARGE CURRENCY CONVERSION FEE OR NOT?If we purchase ticket on line with canadian currency with credit card will you charge currency conversion fee ?
"That fees have to do with the bank conditions for the credit card you own. If you need any further details, please send us all your queries and questions to customer.service@travel2be.com. Regards"
"International conversion fees are charged by your credit card provider, not this gutter dwelling ticket flogger. Do yourself a favour and book direct with the airlines. If in doubt about that, read the previous 261 posts."
"Travel2be is a completely untrustable company. The information is vague, conditions of buy constructed to trick money out of the buyer and the costumer phone service, apart from being expensive, is absolutely unhelpful. After having tried to rebook a ticket over the phone I came to the airport finding my rebooking had not gone through, even though the money had been drawn from my account. I then spent four hours calling back and fourth to a very unhelping costumer service, only to in the end recieve no help at all. The only promise I got was to get back the over 300 euroes I paid to rebook my flight (even though my new ticked was much more costly than this). I still have not recieved this money and when I call the costumer service, somehow the conversation is always ""strangely interrupted"". I will never, never book through travel2be again and I don't recommend anyone else to."
"Hi Fannywh, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY. Unfortunately we did not research them before we booked flights Dublin to Nashville in just over 10 months time, a trip of a lifetime for us. Unfortunately a letter was left out of one of the passenger names( we understand this is not their fault). They were contacted WITHIN 12 HOURS of the booking a month ago via phone, and on numerous occasions since, via phone and email. They are soo rude to deal with. We have contacted both Finair and BA too as these are the companies with whom we are flying....all of them pass the book back to Travel2be. They are now looking to charge over €1000 extra to have this rectified as the flights have gone up since we booked....I kid you not!! . If they had done it when we first contacted them ( straight away), of course we would have been happy to pay the charge for changing a passengers detail. I will never, ever, ever book with them again...... and will be telling anyone and everyone I know about this AWFUL company. BEWARE!"
"Hi ciarsmc, of course we can help you with your name changes. Airlines have different policies for these changes. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with your booking information and the changes you need to make and we will ask the air company if it is possible and if there is an extra fee. Regards"
">>>We have contacted both Finair and BA too as these are the companies with whom we are flying....all of them pass the book back to Travel2be.<<<They aren't passing the buck. I'm afraid the truth is that having chosen to book through a third party, the airline has no contract or relationship with you. Your contract is with Travel2Be, and so is the airline's."
Yep - same as these people above - nearly ripped off with a disappearing discount that only appeared when I entered my credit card details.
"Hi Vitaly M, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
Vitality. Just to let you know that you have received the usual cut and pasted reply that everyone gets who posts on here. I very much doubt Travelgenio have even read your post. Good luck!
"I would strongly encourage anyone considering using Travel2be to read and take heed of the negative reviews. Consider mine a cautionary tale- I wish I had seen them myself. Simply put, their process is deceptive, and confusing. Like some users here I used sky scanner to search for tickets and was redirected to the Travel2be website. I then thought I purchased tickets only to receive an email stating due to security concerns they only use something called 3D Secure payment. Fine. I followed the link and put in all of my payment information. I then received another email confirming my purchase. It also outlined my information including my booking number, passport information, the last four digits of my credit card etc etc. The email concluded with the statement: ""We thank you for booking with Travel2be, we wish you a pleasant trip."" This was a two legged flight. I go to the Amsterdam airport for the first leg, get a boarding pass and board the plane for Manchester. When I arrive however the airline I was supposed to take to Boston had no record of me. While they were trying to figure out what happened I missed the flight. It took me hours to be reprocessed, ""land"", go through security, and explain to a very weary customs agent why I was there and why I had no plans. During their questioning some of the things they were required was a detailed history of my trip, to view the emails from Travel2be, an inspection of the boarding pass for the first leg of the trip, and to show them my bank accounts to prove I had enough money to purchase a new ticket. When I make it to the ticket counter for the airline I was supposed to fly on they stated that Travel2be never booked me for the second part of the flight. Now I am stranded in Manchester. I called Travel2be ($100 in international calling fees) and they told me not only did I not have a ticket but also there was no way I could be in Manchester! I thought that was pretty incredible. They weren't willing to work with me in any capacity and when I asked to speak with a supervisor they insisted there weren't any. The bottom line which they were making very clear- that I had absolutely no recourse. They wouldn't even book me on another flight. So I had to buy another ticket with a different airline but instead of the cost being $428.54 it was $1138.06- three times what I thought I was going to pay. You are taking considerable risk if you book with them. I still have the boarding pass and confirmation emails if you feel you need more convincing."
"HI philipdoyle73, could you please send us all the booking details to customer.service@travel2be.com in order to check what happened? regards"
"I wish I had read this first. My ticket showed £537 all the way through - but when I came to pay it, it jumped to £581 (the £5 Visa fee was separate). Very dodgy web site."

Hi Kajal. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration.
"Kajal, posting your email address on an unmonitored public forum opens you up to all sorts of spammers and scammers. I suggest you delete your duplicate posts immediately.

All I want is an answer to my emails and someone on the phone - i want to know whether she can make a change, but if they won't engage in any contact it is not possible to find out.

The worst travel agency in the world! 90 minutes on line! Taking crazy fees for changes.double from the price of the flight ticket
"I doubt they are the worst. Kiwi probably has that dubious honour.So you wanted a cheap ticket (no doubt) and though an agent would be cheaper than the airline.now do you think they have made enough money selling you that cheap ticket to provide loads of highly trained support staff? Most OTAs make their money from additional fees. They don’t make changes to your ticket for free.that cheap ticket was probably very restrictive, so you’ll have an airline fee, fare difference and agent fee. If it’s so expensive to change it, throw it away and buy a new one from the airline."

Absolutely. These people are a joke!!! Running this company to the ground is now one of my goals as I think their sole purpose is to rip people off. I couldn’t recommend Travel2be/Travelgenio to anyone as it would be immoral! Thanking them again for no help and a shocking experience.

In the middle of the night I get three emails from Travel2be saying that if I want to keep this flight I have to pay 80 euros extra or I can cancel it as the price has changed and they made a mistake.WHAT KIND IF RIP OFF IS THIS?! SHAME ON YOU TRAVEL2BE"
"Geri, Try reading this thread and the dozens like it on this board. Google “live pricing.” The reason it’s not a scam in the legal sense is that they do a very good job of covering their behinds in the Terms and Conditions. Did you read these before purchase? (I know you had to check that you read them, but did you actually read them?)"

"Geri - take the refund and book direct with the airline....as you have found, many of these agents advertise fares cheaper than the airline but they are not live..you made a request to book a flight at a price, the acknowledged your request but could not get a ticket unless you pay the real price"
"Thanks to everyone for posting their experiences. I'll be avoiding this online agent. The ticket they show as available is $400 less (Oz-Europe) than anyone else, which looked suspicious and is clearly too good to be true."

true
"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED! Our daughter had to cancel a flight - we rang three times the week before her flight and the phone kept dropping out after we had waited for 15 minutes each time. We finally got onto a helpful operator who explained she could change the date of her flight as long as we advised the changed date 24 hours ahead of the original flight departing (same itinerary). We said we would phone back with new date options and then then proceeded to try and do this with travel2be 2 days later ….. with no luck. Phone dropped out each time. We therefore emailed travel2be (and well before the 24 hour cut off for flight changes) with the new date options. We didn't hear anything from trave2be so again tried to phone. This time the travel2be person was incredibly rude and said we had missed the cut off time to confirm and when we asked to speak with the Manager she hung up on us! We tired again, finally got onto someone who said she would look at the email we sent ahead of the cutoff and then the phone dropped out or was hung up (prior to this she said she couldn't direct us to the manager). So what do we do next!!!!! The travel2be response so far has been appalling. It feels wrong that our daughter has been unable to secure a new flight when she had every right to do this."

"Avoid them! I booked a 930 euro for a Buenos Aires - Paris return flight on their website and I quickly got a confirmation email, which was fine. A couple of hours later I got an another email basically saying ""sorry but there was a problem with the airline and actually your ticket is going to cost 70 euro more and oh we also changed the date of the return flight. By the way please hurry because we cannot guarantee this price for long"". This ""new"" price and change of dates of course did not suit me at all so I assumed I could easily cancel the whole thing, which would have been fine, but no! they had already charged me 930 euro for a booking that did not exist yet!I phoned them and at first they refused to cancel the booking. I had to threaten them with legal action to get a full refund.How these companies are still allowed to carry out these kinds of dishonest commercial practices is beyond me."

"this is now one of 8 emails sent to you about the same issues....so you should already have all these on your fantastic (NOT) customer tracking system....aside from 11 phone calls....so here we go againSubject: Booking Code GYQMVY ( Contact) # 1962380)  I am just following up to say that we are intending to post on all available web sites, booking sites, travel sites, Trip Advisor to say that your services were appalling during the week that we tried to rearrange the flight Booking Code GYQMVY. We intend to advise all sites and anyone that we know that they should never use TravelgenioWe allowed 1 week to rearrange this and all we received from your company was obstacles and no assistance. Despite numerous phone calls and emails you didn't make contact with Virgin (who were happy to assist in making alterations to the flight) even though I had arranged the contact details. On 4 occasions your staff deliberately terminated calls during periods when you said you were investigating. NO organisation providing services should ever do this !The outcome was, that despite, all our efforts over 1 week you refused to make changes. My feeling is that you deliberately obstructed us so that we were forced into the 24 hour pre flight period....so that you could avoid any actions, assistance and obligations. Our view is that you were very happy to take our money but then very reluctant to assist when there was a problem.We really don't expect you to even do the courtesy of a response ...but a response and your consideration would be welcome"
"It's now over 10 hours since Travelgenio's post. I'd love to know if you did get an email, waynedog, and what Travelgenio say if you do."
"Wayne,How do you know that Travelgenio deliberately hung up on you vs the call naturally dropping due to bad connections? I think you’re giving them way too much credit that they have time to sit around and concoct schemes to stymie your plans. I think the opposite is true: they are severely understaffed GROSSLY (all caps, bold, underlined, italics) incompetent, but not malicious. They are not travel agents. They are a sketchy online booking platform. When people expect them to act as travel agents (which, in fairness, they never were) that is when problems always arise. You’re expecting Michelin Star fine dining from a McDonald’s, and while I feel for your frustrations (truly, I do), I have to also laugh at the absurdity of your expectations. You ended up doing so much legwork with Virgin (as much as a brick and mortar travel agent and certainly more than Travelgenio), that had you booked direct from the start, this would all have been settled long ago."
Hi no response from travelgenio - many days later! Still waiting!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I'm sorry to say Wayne, but if they do reply do not expect a satisfactory resolution or anything approaching help. Their posts on here seem to an nothing more than a feeble and ineffective attempt at reputation management.That said, I hope I am wrong, best of luck.scoodly"
"Hi Wayne, our team replied under mail reference 1989025 your querie. Follow that mail chain if you need any further details. Regards"
Wow. Wayne. You are so lucky. You did not get the standard reply posted by a bot this time!
I wonder if Wayne was happy with the message from Travelgenio or not?
Has anyone on this ever got there refund from them??
"Really! You came back saying we couldn't change the route on the ticket! That wasn't what we requested, it was the date change for travel and we did this request well within the time frame allowed. A refund is needed, end of story otherwise further action will be taken."
">> A refund is needed, end of story otherwise further action will be taken. <<has the airline agreed to refund? (they currently have the money so Travel2be will only refund what they get back from the airlineThere are already 100s of warnings out there, but people still book with them for whatever reasonIf this was a non-refundable ticket, would probably have been better to deal with travel insurance (assuming the reason for cancellation is covered by her policy)"
"I guess the answer to my last question was no!This company is very poor, so it's not really surprising to me that you're struggling to get anywhere with them. I think it will most probably be a lot easier and much quicker to do as Carol suggests and go through your travel insurance. It looks like you've already wasted weeks trying to make progress."
Waynedog55 please follow the mail chain 1989025 where our team is informing about all your request. they will help you with the changes if they are allowed. Regards
"*AVOID TRAVELGENIO/Travel2Be - IT IS A SCAM*I booked a flight with TravelGenio/Travel2Be from San Francisco to Newark. Months before the flight the airline changed the flight by 2 minutes, I received an email from TravelGenio to double check the new information (which I did, the time change for me was fine) but ONE DAY BEFORE DEPARTURE I discovered that I couldn't check-in because TravelGenio (the company I paid for the ticket) ""FORGOT"" to notify Hahn Air (the issuer of the ticket) of the schedule change.Today, 24 hours before the departure and after 4 hours at the phone with the *useless* TravelGenio customer care they told me that ""we have not enough time to send the schedule change now* LITERALLY leaving me with the only option to buy a new, 4 times more expensive ticket.TravelGenio Customer Care also has the habit of dropping the call when I clearly explain that the step that is missing is on their side (just send the schedule change) and they ""sense"" that they cannot tell me anymore to contact Hahn Air or Alaskan Airlines (which I did several times and both say that TravelGenio needs to start the process).To you fellow traveler I say: AVOID TRAVELGENIO, you will lose your money.To Hahn Air: please close your contract with TravelGenio, they are a scam and you don't want your brand to be associated with such companies."

"TravelGenio, I contacted your Customer Care several times spending hours at the phone to no avail. Twice my call has been interrupted suddenly by your Customer Care representatives and I'm sure that was not a technical problem on the phone line!At last I desperately called Alaska Air Customer Care and, even if they didn't have the proper e-Ticket for my flight, the CC representative was kind enough to leave a note explaining my desperate situation attached to my booking and suggested I go as early as possible to the airport (I was there at 4:30 AM for an 8 AM domestic flight) to make sure they were able to print my boarding pass. Fortunately, they were kind enough to sort the situation for me and let me board the flight!!!Kudos to Alaska Air Customer Care!!! Shame on TravelGenio!Edited: 1 year ago "

"This company travel2be, there customer service is TERRIBLE! I have been trying to change my ticket, I spent two days on the phone to them, the first time all the customer service member wanted to did was drop the call. The next one she was suppose to of emailed me and never bothered. I contacted them twice by email have receipts of the emails and they have denied ever getting.To me the Management just want free money and give ZERO service. I wouldn't touch the company they give zero customer service and act in an unprofessional manner. I even paid for an open flexi ticket and insurance and looks like I have lost the lot. For gods sake Air NZ and Cathay Pacific and others blacklist this company."
"Is that on their never ending plan. The same old remarks, our system isn't working? Can we email you back. Then you never hear from them again. Or there other comment we never received your emails but you have a generated tracking no they send and a generated email. if you are not receiving emails fix your USELESS out of date system or stop accepting people's money.You are appalling and fraudulent, the behaviour of your staff is boarding on deceitful. I am contacting the management of Air New Zealand on Monday to see if I can get the company blacklisted in this country."
That will give AirNZ management a laugh.

"Travel2be is the WORST! the worst travel agent ever! Truly a big scam. We need to change the name of the ticket and change the date...called the customer service and the guy can't even speak English properly... If that's not hard enough ....they used the excuse ""Contact The Airline"" to hang up on you. When we called the airline, of course, the airline said ""The ticket is issued by the Travel Agency, we don't have the right to change anything. You will have to talk to the Travel Agency"". So it took us 6 hours of nonstop calling the Travel Agency, they finally picked up the phone...and then they said ""Ok we can't change it but we are not sure if your ticket is refundable or not. Please contact your airline"" I mean....seriously....WTF! You pretty much book the flight tickets that you don't have the right to modify it at all and waste hours of contracting between the airline and travel agent. Truly truly a waste of time and disappointment. If you want to enjoy your flight or trip. seriously don't book anything with Travel2Be."

"Absolute scam - wish I looked at their reviews prior to completing my booking. Paid additional charges for ""personalized service"" as it noted seat selection and I wanted to ensure my partner and I were seated next to each other as this was an overseas flight. Never received any option to select my seats, then when I called to enquire about it they just said ""don't worry about it, it's all taken care of, you don't get to choose your seats, we've done this for you."" Then when I asked what I've paid for they had the audacity to say ""nothing as you didn't write any special requests"". Of course there'd be no refund on that part of the booking either."

"I’m in your shoes now and I’m crying like literally. I called twice one lady just kept on saying “you wanna cancel it?” It’s about my booking redgarding my flight wherein they wanted me to oay extra which I’m ok but they did not send me an email as they mentioned. So i called again and was told that they will send me my tickets within two hours but none. I suppose they just want to cut me off quickly. Whoever their third party customerservice provider is they are not reliable. I paid ¥129,000 for my trip. I paid but no ticket no nothing. I would try to call my bank and see how it goes."

Mira. You will get nowhere with the Travelgenio bot. As you can see your posts are not being read as you have already sent an email. They just press a button and churn out the same old rubbish! I'm afraid you are banging your head against a brick wall.
“Hopefully i could get it sort out quickly and get a refund soon for my amex and mastercard.”I don’t know what about this experience thus far gives you any hope that you will receive a refund “soon.”
"I have received emails from C.S and the non reply refund automated message. I just have to wait for 48hours,if no result i will talk to my CC provider to dispute it. but so far the automated bot did check my concern. fingers crossed."
"i would just like to update,my amex has been debited. I'm just waiting for my other creditcard to be debited as well. so far it only took 2 days for my Amex. I'll update once my master has been credited."

"We used Travel2be and have had problems. We gave them the married surname instead of the maiden name that is on French passports. We have been trying to get Travel2be to modify the ticket, but they have been unresponsive. The travel is in May, and we hope to hear from them, but so far they have not made the changes. We will update if they modify the ticket."
"It would be simpler to get a new passport in the married name, and perhaps not as expensive."
Hi Roger . Airlines have different policies for these changes. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking information and the changes you need to make and we will ask the air company if it is possible and if there is an extra fee. Regards
Roger. At least you have managed to find the one place where you do get a response from the Travelgenio bot! Please do not expect to get any further!
"We are also having a difficult time with Travel2Be or Travelgenio. We bought a ticket last September and accidentally put the married name and did not add the maiden name, as is on her French passport. We realized it right away and since then have tried to get Travel2be to issue a modified ticket. They have stalled, been very difficult and have not changed the ticket. The travel is in May and we are very worried. Hopefully Travel2be will answer us, but so far we can't recommend them."
"Hi Roger, any name change has to be authorised by airlines. That is why during the booking process we ask to use the same info as in the docs needed for the trip. If you need any further details regarding your tickets allowances, please follow our mail chains or send us a requirement to customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
"Travelgenio Bot. I would imagine that you have been sent all the relevant information in the past 5 months and are only offering help now that the poster has found Trip Advisor! Roger.

mcanup732003 This is a Trip Advisor Forum where volunteers answer questions about travel related issues. It has nothing to do with Travel2be and I doubt anyone replying on here works for them or has any knowledge of your issue. Please contact Travel2be for assistance with your issue.
"mcanup,This is NOT Travel2be. In addition, your multiple posts are considered to be spamming the forums so don/t be surprised if they are removed."
I would like to add my voice to the litany of complaints regarding Travel2B /Travelgenio online - please DO NOT BOOK with them! Wish I had seen/read reviews first! Ticket price went up a €100 between reviewing flight details & paying - this is due to card used to pay - the discount is removed for payment with certain cards. This is not made clear /obvious to the site user. Customer complaints can be made by email only - so you can not speak to someone about. I called customer service who cut me off when I starting complaining over the phone that their site is misleading /sharp practice ! The customer service rep just kept saying I would need to wait for email reply.
"Hi Sightseer302741, we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"Sightseer. You have got the cut and pasted reply from the very busy Travelgenio bot. You will see that it has posted over 2,700 useless offers of help on this forum. Please do not expect to get anywhere!"
"Actually, I think if you read the terms and conditions you will find most rules/fees are pretty clear, both for Travelgenio and any of the other sketchy third party middlemen out there. This goes against common TA advice, but I’ve come to believ that one does not need to any outside research of a third party before purchasing: reading the terms and conditions should be more than enough to have you running for the hills. If you had read the terms, I’m guessing you would either have used a different form of payment or not gone through with the transaction all together (the wise choice). It is not Travelgenio’s fault that you didn’t read the terms though. They can’t be blamed for that, nor should they offer any refund for charging the fees they said they would charge."
"Reading the terms should have any sensible person running for the hills as fast as they can, but so should a couple of minutes looking at the number and type of complaints against Travelgenio et al.I don't mind which method people use, as long as they do run! The trouble is that so many people see what they think is a cheap and real fare, and don't stop to think to do anything else other than jump on it. I feel this is because they think they have to act fast before it disappears - which is, of course, exactly what these outfits want people to think."

"Travel2be is a total scam, scumbags, they manipulate the payment system and steel money by deceiving people. I bought a ticket through them, somehow, they charged my credit card twice for the same ticket because they instructed me to enter my credit card details again for extra security !!. I rang them in Spain and spent $55 dollar call while waiting, eventually I spoke to a scumbag who said sorry, it must be a system failure on their part. and promised to refund the money, they did refund the money after 4 days of calling and emailing. But guess what ! they charged me nearly $100 in exchange rate difference. so basically they charge $2270.00 for the ticket, but returned $2170 on something not of my own making. So, I figured out, those scumbags do it to most customers, and that is where they make their real profit.I hate them.. Never again to buy through any of those crawling cockroaches."
"Hi Raghid, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
Was there a reason you chose to deal with them as a third party rather than booking directly with the airline? (It also looks like you chose not to do any research before handing them a lot of money - always risky)
Everyone books with them as they scam people by showing higher discounts. And are IATA certified? But I guess these certifications are only for aesthetics and these cheats still operate Scott free without repercussions.
"A little research would scare anyone away from booking with them. That you didn’t perform your due diligence will engender little sympathy from the regulars here. They will obviously charge fees for everything they do. They are a business, not a charity. They don’t work for free."
"Am happy for you mate that your researches have worked well with you. We all know when operating with business what are charges and what are scams.. Thanks for your 2 cents about something, I don't know what"
"No, on this forum at least, many people call companies a scam when they are anything but. So it would seem there is a lot of confusion between charges and scams.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Misleading site. Not clear at all. Customer service did not provide us an answer on our specific question. They proceeded our request wrongly. While booking the flight, we could not choose between hand luggage only or hand luggage and 1 checked luggage. When clicking on bagage the box behind it was empty - no information. We selected the request extra bagage for 14 euro each in order to be sure that we would be able to check in one luggage; On the confirmation mail I received Sunday after making the reservation for the flight tickets, there is written 39,80 euro on the invoice and total 294,50 euro so we thought everything was already included in the price charged by our credit card. We were surprised to receive the mail from travel2B asking us to pay 14 euro x 2 in order to proceed the request. We asked for clarity.I repeatedly asked for clarity on what the price was for being able to check in a luggage - not the price travel2B charges for the service. Two times I got this message:Mon 5/20/2019 5:50 PM : In case you wish to add checked baggage the price it's the one we provided you in the previous email. Tue 5/21/2019 11:51 AM :We inform you that the price previously reported is given by the airline.I asked to forward me the mail in which this price was reported. I even called travel2B to speak to someone on the phone . -> travel2B did not forward me the mail. They did not write me the price for checking in. On the phone they could not give me the price neither. They said someone would inform me on the price by mail the next day. On Tuesday 21st we finally thought we had understood it clearly and said to Mahela that she could charge 1x 14 euro to proceed for arranging that we can bring ONE piece of luggage for the two of us together, so 1 extra luggage in total and not 2 extra luggages. We were surprised to be asked to pay 37 euro on top of the 14 euro. No clarification that this was in fact for 2 luggages.We only read that on the final confirmation letter we received after paying the additional cost: we paid 39,80 euro = 19,90 euro X 2 pax. THIS IS FOR 2 luggages. Again, not what we had asked for."
was there a reason you could not book direct with the airline where all the baggage fees etc would be very clear?Why choose a shonky third party...they make their money from fees so it will usually cost you more.
"Hi Abossier, of course we can help you with the luggage information for the rate selected. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with your booking code and we will tell you the allowed baggage for your ticket rate. Regards"
most of the tickets they sell are non-refundable...(with the exception of some taxes - less their fees) are you sure there was any funds left the be refunded? it will be based on the fare rules of the ticket you asked them to purchase for you.
"Hi Alice, of course we can help you with your booking doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with your booking code and we will tell you the booking status. Regards"
"“Please don’t choose this platform unless you are certain with all your booking info”I mean, duh. The only way to have success with any of the shonky third party middlemen is A) be absolutely certain of everything and be prepared to change nothing B) enter all of your info correctly and C) want to fly the lowest fare class with no luggage, seat selection etc. There’s lots that can still go wrong, but if you meet these there qualifications there’s a chance things could go well. Why anyone would buy the most restrictive tickets from a third party known for high fees and shoddy customer service when their plans aren’t set in stone is beyond me!"
"Alice, customer service form all of the online ticket floggers like Travel2Be is going to be less than good. It's a natural and unavoidable consequences of working to very thin margins in a highly competitive environment.Don't think that it's just this particular platform, because it's not."
"Travel2Be is horrible!!! They changed the time of our flight in the time between me booking online and receiving my confirmation email. They don't offer refunds or changes to the flight if you didn't pick it up and CALL their international line back in 1 hour. AND as the email was in Spanish, I didn't know of this 1 hour rule. I did send up to 5 email complaints and didn't hear back from them. On my 20 min call to a very short tempered agent, he stated that they dont make changes or give refunds if I cancel.Let this be a clue that I am not the only one who experienced this issue: On their website where you can log a complaint, one of their dropdown box option categories are ""Involuntary change made by airline"".I needed to rebook new flights (not with Travel2be) and never saw my money for the flights again.KEEP AWAY."
You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your cooperation.
"I recently booked a ticket from Perth, Western Australia to Bali. The booking was confirmed and received the itinerary. A couple of hours later received a new email saying ""could not confirm the booking with the airline"" and that they had to change my flight but would have to pay extra money. I contacted the airline to ask them what happened, and they said that they are waiting from payment from traveltobe to confirm the booking and that the flight has not been changed or canceled. The original flight is still available on traveltobe website as well the airline's website.I have tried to contract traveltobe multiple times over and over again and I am on hold and then it hangs up, so cannot speak to anyone. I have also sent emails and no response. They have now taken my money, and I have no flight unless I pay them more money when there is absolutely no reason for them to change the booking in the first place. Definitely a SCAM."
"third party ticket floggers work in a similar wayThey advertise a price to attract customers. These customers will either do a little research and find they don't have live prices, in your case they cannot sell you a ticket at the advertised price, see the horrible terms and conditions and fees, they read the reviews and they go to the airline site to book their ticket.or they see the price and click click buyThe payment taken from your card will be a hold that will drop back off as they have not been able to provide what you asked forSpeak to your card company if it is not back in 72 hours and understand there is no cheap air fairy"
"Hi Tess, of course we can help you with your booking doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with your booking code and we will tell you the booking status. Regards"
"Tess you never had a booking confirmation, you had a ve firmation of your booking request."
"No, it's not a scam. They way that they work is pretty clear if you read the T&C's. AmoMondon is quite correct to say that you never made a booking. You put in a booking request and you received confirmation that the awful Travel2be had got it and were working on it. Carol has given you good advice about what to do.Trying to speak to them is just wasting time. Nothing can be changed, that's how they operate. And they are not alone. Choose any other online booking site and the chances are that they won't have live pricing either. There are very few that do.I have no interest in playing these games, so I just book directly with the airline."
"DONT EVER USE THIS SITE !!It's a perfect steal :I booked a flight for a total amount showed in USD like ""$370.083"" while they were charging me in Chilean pesos the same amount, which made a difference of more that 100 euros in the amount i payed. In the confirmation mail they were very clear: ""you have payed an amount of CLP370.083"" but when you are paying they play the thief game by making you believe you're paying in dollars.Fortunately, i have all the screenshots of the payment process because i was booking for someone else.I called several times to customer service and every time a different agent gave a different excuse by not being polite at all.What a bad experience !!!Edited: 1 year ago "

"Travel2be - cheater company! be careful !1) when I completed my booking, flight details was different, after the make the payment with mistake. Tried to solve the issue - contacted with customer service. They asked penalty 180 EUR (3 passengers). I paid. Change doesn't happened. They inform me that they are make a mistake and need more 41 EUR. I paid. Change doesn't happened. They inform me that they are make a mistake and need more 60 EUR. I asked to cancel my booking and return money. They are silent. Not answering to my phone and not answering to email. My booking ref # SXEEHBBE CAREFUL !!! Travel2Be - CHEATER web page & company"

Worst agency ever! don't use them. I brought tickets from Perth to Doha via sky scanner and they somehow added another $150 to my bill. They are very hard to contact and flat out rude. Avoid using them !
"Hi Miss-a, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
""" they somehow added another $150 to my bill"" => Maybe you somehow did not check what you clicked (or did not unclick) and also what was written in the T&C's.""They are very hard to contact and flat out rude"" => That might be. And you did not select them for good customer service but because they promised a lower price. Low price goes rarely with premium customer service.Maybe the next time you book directly with the airline and not a shonky third party, or also read about a company before you hand them over your hard earned money."
"I booked in a short Term one day before my flight. Their System sent me two confirmation E-Mails with to different links for the payment. After payment (including confirmation), my booking was cancelled according to their system. On their hotline, they told me two Times (two different people) that i should pay double! They were not interested in the Situation at all! One told me she will hang Up and i should call someone Else! Her colleague told me it Takes some time and i should call in 30 minutes when His shift is done! Lucky me, there was one Guy who were interested in my Situation and who checked and fixed their system. Thus, he saved my holidays... Thanks to him!Due to that experiences, i can't recommend it!!!"
"Hi Volker, of course we can help you with your booking doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with your booking code and we will tell you the booking status. Regards"
>> I booked in a short Term one day before my flight <<the only place to book flights for imminent travel is direct with the airline. Often third parties can take 24 hours+ to turn a booking request into a booking.
"Volker,Have you flown yet?"
"I have made a similar mistake using this agency... Due to an incorrect booking made by this agency, my two flights were scheduled too close to one another (less than two hours in between) which is not allowed according to the airline of the flights that were connected by this agency. Therefore I had to cancel my first flight and lost all the money I paid for it, while also having to purchase a new flight. The customer service was the worst. I called consecutively (over 40 times) for months (from February through end of July trying to get my flights switched and they continued to tell me is ""don't worry"" ""you have time"" ""we work by proximity"" ""Expect to see a change by next Monday""... (which was repetitive by different operators and no changes were ever made... But when the airlines tell me that this should've been handled months ago, this makes me feel very unsafe working with an agency who does not act on behalf of their mistakes and does not care about their customer concerns... The trade agency did not actually reach out to me until they saw that I made the changes to my flights by myself, so they called me and asked me to confirm that they could close my case... Even though they had done absolutely nothing to help me with it."
"Hi Katelyn, the times to connect flights, once they are booked together, is the one provided by airlines. If you need us to check your bookings, do not hesitate in contacting us in customer.service@travelgenio.com. Regards"
"WARNING: Do not buy any flight tickets via agency Travel2be !!!Beginning of April, I have booked flights from Vienna to New York via London for late Oct (for the NYC marathon 2019). July9, I received an email from them, that the flight from Vienna to London was changed, which meant I would not catch the flight from London to New York. After 3 days trying, I finally reached someone on the phone. This person assured me that he changed the flights to an earlier time, so I will be in New York even earlier, but the airline has to confirm it and it will take one month. !!!After 5 weeks of waiting and no confirmation coming, I tried to contact them again. They do not reply to any emails and changed their phone number. I have only reached their answering machine and spent more than 50 EUR trying to reach them with no success. Then I called the airline and they said that they haven't received any request to change the flight from the agency. They are now checking whether they can change it, as normally the agancy should do it."
Unfortunately you'll have to be persistent with them to try and get this fixed. They have notably poor customer service. Next time consider booking with the airline directly to cut-out the middle party
"Hi milos110, of course we can help you with your booking changes. Sometimes airlines change their flight plans and our agents inform passengers about the possible alternatives. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com and we will inform you about the latest flight schedule and the alternatives they gave us in case they don't suit your plans. Regards"
milos.You have received an automated reply from the Travelgenio bot. As you can see no human being has actually read your post.Good luck!

"Hi Nicolás, you have the terms and conditions in our site. If you need further info regarding the special service option, please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com. Regards"
"Beware of this SCAM website. They refuse to refund money from a cancelled flight. I've contacted them dozens of times and get a different story every time. I've emailed them the documentation they request and again they just have a different story every time,no refund! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! you will get ripped off.Just to summarize, our flight was cancelled through no fault of ours and travel2be or travelgenio, whoever they claim to be, kept my $! Isn't that illegal?"
"Your experience is not different than mine. They are a giant SCAM, they'll take your money and provide no service. How is it they can keep the money I spent for a flight that was cancelled by the airline? Sounds like thievery to me. I've called at least a dozen times and get a different answer every time. I wish I knew before what I know now about this bogus company."
"Hi Brian, of course we can help you with your booking refund. Please note that refunds depend on the airlines and each of them have different administrative times.

"I am trying to book a flight from Toronto to Varadero Cuba and Skt Scanner has a one appear from Travel2Be that leaves YYZ at 11:40 pm. Now, I travel frequently to Cuba and for a flight to leave this late from Toronto is odd. But wait, this gets better... The flight arrives to Varadrero (who is on same local time zone as us) at 1:45 AM. That is a flight time of 2 hrs 5 mins. It is impossible!!!! the shortest possible travel time is 3 hrs to Varadero from Toronto. I called to get clarification only to be pushed into booking the flight. There is a discrepancy in the either the flight date or the time or the flight does not exist! Here is the kicker... Sunwing has no record of this flight WG677 on Oct 11, 2019. What gives??"
"They are a truly awful ticket flogger so nothing they do surprises me.They don’t have live pricing and availability, no doubt the flight doesn’t exist.The question is why you’re considering giving them your money."
"I'm in agreement with AmoMondo. If the airline doesn't have a flight listed, the agent is lying - either deliberately or accidentally because they are total rubbish."
I have just serch for tickets with flight by serch engineer and when i click on Travel2be the ticket always increase by 20% when i get there. This company is a scam do not book anything with them.Bjorn
Travel2be is fraud and never book ticket from here. They have taken my payment but not confirmed my booking. My booking ID is WYHNXG. They said they'll be sending another mail with confirmation. No mail has received. Even contacted customer care number and mail id. still no respone.
"Gursanjam, if that is your real name as your username you need to have a better understanding of the internet. Revealing your name and booking references and other personal information online to the whole world is a sure fire way to setting yourself up as a victim of fraud.."
When did you make your booking request? If it’s less than 48 hours your too quick to be mentioning frauds or scams.You don’t make a booking with these sites like you do when you book directly with the airline. They don’t have any tickets to sell you nor do they have live prices and availability. You ask them to book you a ticket. They send a confirmation they have your request. Then they try to go an buy a ticket at that price. This isn’t instant. Then one of three things will happen:1. They will buy you a ticket and you flight booking is confirmed2. They won’t be able to buy you a ticket and ask for more money 3.They won’t be able to buy you a ticket at that price and will cancel your booking request.With 2 &3 they may come up with excuses like there was a problem with your card rather than admit they don’t have live prices.Why did you choose them when there are so many complaints about them going back years?
Hi Gursanjam. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration.
"I used trave 2 be, but the service is terrible!I got cancel insurance, to get some refund when I cancel the flight, but it don't refund anything. I asked to customer center that when and how much can I get the refund, but it never answer my question. I asked five times but finally the customer service doesn't answer. I never use travel 2 be again!"
"Hi Mesiki, of course we can help you with the management of your insuranced ticket. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with your booking code and the arrangement you want to make and we will tell you if it is possible and the steps to follow. Regards"
I also was scammed by paying an extra $300 added to the last page sneakily as I didn't pay with a certain credit card. Deceptive and don't use this site.
"Hi Angie, of course we can help you with the payment doubts and the final price confirmed after all the booking procedure and selections. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
Worst booking agency ever!Do not use these guys. Because they will advertise a completely false low prize and charge you much more in the end!Never again!
">> they will advertise a completely false low prize <<that is how the majority of shonky third party ticket floggers without live pricing workIf you want to see a live price, you will find it on the airline website. You don't need to use a third party and pay their service fees to buy a ticket, you can do it yourself direct with the airline.If you are tempted by a low price advert - check out the reputation of the company and then decide if you want to give them your money"
"Hi Vincent, if you need us to check the charges for the booking do not hesitate in sending us all the details to customer.service@travel2be.com. Regards"
">>>that is how the majority of shonky third party ticket floggers without live pricing work<<<+1 to that. All you have to do, Vincent, is pour yourself a nice little beverage and spend 20 minutes or so looking at some of the thread sin this forum to see just how many shonky companies there are who do exactly the same thing.There is nothing particularly special or unique about Travelgenio, except perhaps for their lovable little bot posting useless replies here."
"Hi,I emailed them already. Please refund my money because my booking is not confirmed and ticket is not issued. My booking code is MQCXQD. Best,Phung"
Hi Dzung You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration.

Hello PezJey. Of course we can help you with your queries on the amounts for your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travel2be.com stating your booking reference and your queries about this and we will check the details immediately. Regards.
"I agree with your conclusion but I don't agree it's a scam. It's not as if they hide where they are based, so all it needs is a little bit of research. But, of course, if you do that research you'll probably find out how poor they are and go elsewhere anyway."
Yep total scam beware learnt the hard way
"Hi, we had our entire booking cancelled by travel2be.com after a few of the flights were cancelled by the airline. We were not notified of the cancellation and only found out due to calling airline to reconfirm flights. We now have been told to wait 30 to 90 business days before we will receive a full refund. Yeah right!! I don't expect to see this refund any time soon. NEVER use this site (its on the Sky Scanner website as an option)."
"Hello Journey247194. Let us check the status of the refund with the airline, as you know it is the airline that manages and approves refunds. Could you please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with the details of your booking so we can raise the query? The refund times vary depending on the airline. We look forward to hearing from you. Thank you, regards."
Do you all even bother to reply?

WORST website ever. been trying to cancel my Shanghai flights for over a week now. Airline is offerign full refund give current virus situation but asked me to get in touch with agent. Travel2be does NOT answer their 24 hour hotllien EVER. They do not reply to emails. pls DO NOT USE THIS SITE its a scam
COMPLETE SCAM wesbite. noone rpelies on email and nobody picks up 24 hour hotline. been trying to cancel my booking for ages now and even though airlien offers FULL refudn given virus situation I need to do it trhough agent. SCAM website - NOONE replies.
"If you booked a non-refundable ticket, you will not get a refund."
If the airline canceled the flight they will get a refund. Just not quickly and likely not 100%
>> I need to do it trhough agent. <<that is correct. You chose to deal with a third party instead of booking with the airline direct.Travel2be is the customer of the airlineyou are the customer of Travel2beRubbish customer service is well-documented for many third party ticket floggers (keeps their costs low) These things are the trade-off you make to save a few bucks
"Hello Nisha. We would like to help you with your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travel2be.com so that one of our agents can contact you. Thank you, regards."
"Tjey are not a scam website. It's natural, given the current situation, that the normal poor service from agents when it comes to handling calls and emails is going to slip down to 'dreadful' levels. Everyone is under great pressure because of coronavirus.Now I'm not defending them, as they are a waste of space in my book, I'm just trying to tell it like it is."
"I have used travel2be (through Sky scanner) twice now. 1st was to bring my son home from Rome to Perth Australia. In November 2019. Had no problems at, yes there was a credit card fee, but that was it. Everything went according to plan, was the cheapest option to get him home. Have just used them a second time for a flight home from Japan to Perth. The booking orocedure went fine, tickets emailed straight away. The problems started when my son wanted to change tie date and departure city. Can not get hold of them by phone. Emails went unanswered. I emailed daily and messaged on Facebook. Seem the Facebook messages get them to respond to emails. Worked out cheaper to cancel flights and pay penalties than pay penalties and flight change charges. Once I got into a email back and fussed with them, it was all sorted quickly and my refund was in my bank in less than 48 hours.given they are in Spain in went smoother than I thought"

"Travel2Be is based in Spain, and that country is in total lockdown. There is probably nobody allowed to travel to its office."
">>>I dont know how who people are so irresponsible with the customers.<<<venigalla, you could turn that around and ask why people are so irresponsible with their money as to use a shoddy outfit like Travel2Be/Travelgenio.As sydneynick has noted, things are pretty serious in Spain and across many parts of the world right now. That's not going to make a company who generally have dismal support and customer service get any better. It will only make them get even worse.You need to modify your expectations accordingly."

"ravel2be is the WORST! the worst travel agent ever! we bought 3 tickets ti Prague with my elder mum. Our flight cancelled due to Covid. Airline told that since I booked through an agency we should apply for a refund at the agency.After contacting, not only I was told that they would not return the money to us, but demanded that we have to pay $ 90 to issue any voucher in future. Just theft! Not only were we hit by a flight cancellation, but we also had to pay for them to be issued and voucher. I work with dozens of companies. We never experienced such a humiliating attitude. Even when i received voucher from others company (jumbo fly for example) it was free and for all flights that i can book via their site. Travel 2 be is the worst company i ever met. That's how we basically lost the whole amount."

"I agree with this travel agency it really has bad customer services. I booked my flight from Skyscanner using Garuda Indonesia to flight 4 September 2020 Narita directly flight to Denpasar Bali. Today airlines sent new schedule coz Bali still don’t open international flight. They change the route from Haneda to Jakarta and Jakarta to Bali on the same date, but I think better take another date to flight change jkt-Bali. So I call the GA to change the date but they say I should call the travel2be first. I call the travel2be to change it but they say no the flight on the date I want (talk with the Japanese language but I think they not really under it coz sound like the person it's not Japanese). Travel2be offer me to call GA again, I call again the GA says the same thing again and give advice that makes sure the travel agency called GA to fix that. The second time I call travel2be and tell everything why GA says they were so angry talk on the phone and asking back if ”how you can think we are not professional to check the flight's in here there no data again for next flight. If you don't think we are not professional press 1 and if we professional press 2” the customer woman said it and cut my call. It's the first time I had this bad experience with a travel agency, never gonna use this website to book flights or etc. Be careful everyone ✌️"

It does not allow us to check the status of our refund as it says the reservation is not cancelled. It says if you want to cancel your reservation please go to cancel my reservation. We are not happy to do this as we did not cancel the reservation, the airline cancelled the flight. You might give us an inquiry number and some indication of the next steps we should take. We are at considerable loss and financial hardship."
"Follow the instructions in post 525, Mary. Then be prepared to wait many many months.Next time you shop on the internet, find threads like this BEFORE you give your money to bad companies. No one in their right mind would see this thread and then use Travel2Be as their ticket agent"
"Mary C, Once a flight is cancelled, from Travel2be we demand the refund to airlines and, once they authorise them (with in terms of time depends on airline companies and it can be delayed even months), we immediately make the refund to the same payment method used during the booking process.From our side we are refunding all tickets as soon as airlines are managing their refunds, so the delay in them are generated by the processes airline manage.If you need to know the refund status, you can access to MyTrips section in our site, introducing the mail used in the booking process."
"According to some, when a flight is cancelled Travel2Be/Travelgenio do nothing. When an airline refunds them, Travel2Be/Travelgenio do nothing.I'm confident that if you do ask they request, they will do something at some point, but I think it would be foolish to imagine they will leap into action and start working on your behalf immediately, as they like to imply."
