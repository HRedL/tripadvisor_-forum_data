HiThe Gambian Health Ministry and the WHO have placed Gambia on Cholera alert due to an outbreak in Senegal Cases in TG normally occur upcountry where proper sanitation is lacking Just be extra careful regarding basic health and hygiene regimes rgds
"Great. That's the last thing I need after my fibroids, malaria, worms, cold and uti. Still loving The Gambia, I will not be broken!"

Thanx Adrian cheered me up too!! lol Too late for me now even if you could get jab :(
Are you back now Gingerbells or are you still over there working in the hospital and how is it going?
yes be careful of your hygiene rules & take care on what you eat/drink & take some Dioralyte sachets or similar -which is a good idea even for the dreaded Banjul belly.
HiStatement fromthe Gambian Health Ministry now online some very good advise on behaviour if cholera does appear in TG Last outbreak didnt come near the tourist area www.allafrica.com/stories/201201060898.html rgds
"Thanks ridddim ,Also do not forget to take the alcohol gel available in pharmacies or any most poundlands for a POUND ,keep washing hands ,shake them dry ,towels are usually not spotless and use the gel .Thanks irish :-)Edited: 8 years ago "
"The final line of the statement did make me smile, ""Let us join hands to prevent the spread of cholera in our country.""Hopefully hands are well washed first :-)"
"We have been going to TG for 10years now and have all the jabs except YF and funny enough our travel nurse this time recommended we have the cholera prevention, maybe she was pshycic. It is taken as a drink, first 2 about 4-6 weeks apart and then another after about 6 months. Hopefully this will help even though we do take as much precaution as possible.Gary"
"She was possibly pre-warned,maybe , a good reason to consult trained informed medics perhaps,doubt she was phsycic"
I've just been reading up on the Cholera vaccination as I had it 30 years ago and was wondering if I was still covered. The info says that the immunisation only lasts for 3 months !!!....... ;0)))))Edited: 8 years ago 
"The medical literature is saying that the two oral vaccines available now provide protection for 2 years after the first dose and for 3-4 years if you have a booster after one year, with the injected vaccine now only used in endemic areas."
Well too late for us...so I shall go buy some hand gel and try to avoid shaking too many hands x
"It is acceptable to present knuckels to tap or if they are dirty ones elbows as happened when saying hello to a mechanic with oily hands have an enjoyable break lincolstables,hand gel is a really good idea ,use it often I do ,never had banjul belly anywhere I only eat well cooked food ,drink tea and never take ice :-)"
"Hey BruffI have a really weak immune system, is this infectious or contagious? what an earth causes it?"
HiBreezyIts a bacterial infection and its highly infectious click on the link on thread 6 and its fully explained with info on how to avoid it rgds
"Thank you IrishadrianI will do that as we are thinking of just booking a last minute break in the next 7 to 10 days and I probabley haven't a hope in hell getting into our doctors! so just wondering if it might be a bad idea to visit, but it the only opportunity as if we don't go soon we have to wait until November!"
"Breezy I wouldn't panic, just take the advised precautions. Be great if you can make it, be nice to meet up :) Seen some very cheap return flights ( jan 12th £225 choose return date up to 21 days) I'm off on Monday :):):)"
"Breezy,It wouldn't put me off going at all. There is, as yet, no reported case in the Gambia and the preventive measures advised by the Gambian government are only aimed at those travelling out of Gambia, particularly to Senegal. Otherwise, the Gambian government just advises its "" general public "" to look out for the symptoms. All that's necessary is do what you'd normally do in Gambia, such as drink bottled water, make sure your food is not undercooked, wash your hands and so on.John"
"Hi RiddimchefIs that from Gatwick as there not that good from Manchester but found a last minute deal staying at Badala or Sarges from £550.00 -£600.00 for the week which includes transfer and luggage leaving on the 14th February, very tempting but trouble is just signing paperwork for a house so have to wait until Monday and talk to solicitors, by then you can bet it will be gone!! Where are you staying??"
Oh that the total price for the two of us not for one!!
"Breezy, when it comes to serious infections we all have weak immune systems,Get into the habit of always washing hands, before and after meals ,toilet, handling money, make sure you always allow your hands to dry before applying the hand gelIt i the system we should be in the habit of using at all time anyhow,I always wash fruit and veg with water sachets before eating ,cleaning teeth etctake a break and enjoy,sorry I was offline doing an installation on my grandaughters laptop :-)"
"Hi BruffI must admit that hand washing is something that I do believe in very strongly as if there is a bug about and if there is a bad stomach to be had then me and the Mr will get it!!! I will tell you it has been very difficult in the Gambia with all this hand shaking because the locals they just pee in the bush or infact any where and most of the time they don't wash their hands. We stayed at the Mansea once over looking the side just by the kitchen there is an area just at the side with a wall, this was used by the staff as a toilet and they took a kettle of water you know the plastic type, didn't see any soap taken. I often wondered how we didn't get some very bad stomach upsets but we seldom ate or drank there anyway.I can't tell you how frustrating it is to have someone shake your hand and to have just cleaned them and mostly this happens on the beach a packet of hands wipes goes nowhere every one you meet says ""shake hands it the gambian way"", and your constantly just cleaning hands and it all starts again!!"
"Hi keep washing them ,your hands ,that is ,air drying them then apply the gel and allow to air dryYou say if there are bad stomachs around you get it ,well perhaps you are doing something amiss,It is a third world country in a white area with few or no toilets available to locals ,be tolerant ,cats and dogs do the same here there and every country everywhere, As for the hotel you should have seen the management re toiletIf you are really concerned do not shake hands offer your knuckle ,then apply gel and wash soon as.Hope this has helped :-)"
Staying at our place we rent in Kololi Breezy. Good luck with the bargain hunting!!
I have been told that after 3 times of applying gel you must wash your hands thoroughly or gel loses its affects.Gary
Now Im not sure how true this is but a friend of mine who is a nurse has just told me not too worry as we take Doxycycline for Malaria.She says that the antibiotic content of this drug would help against catching cholera.I must admit we have never had any stomach issues in any 3rd world country while taken these tablets.
"funnily enough i was just coming on here to post this as our practice recieved info on this on Friday, so sounds like your nurse may well have had inside info Gary. Certainly wouldnt let it put anyone off going as just precautionary and soemthing to make people aware of at this stage. There is no injection anymore as it was painful and not very effective! The current vaccine is an oral preparation, but is chargable. Hand gel is a must too - i take it everywhere - even in uk! None of us have ever had upset tums too, even the kiddies (touchwood!) xxxEdited: 8 years ago "
Our cholera preventative was free as everything else is except YFGary
oooh your lucky Gary!!! Our practice charges. Its probably one of those that its at practices discretion................
"Why would one apply hand gel three times without getting up and at least attempting to wash ones hands, Making the effort to do such things is part of ones health care,I cannot comment on the tree times then wash, it sounds sensible , do not get carried away and let this matter spoil your holiday"
"Anyone know the average cost of cholera vaccine and if any side effects? I return in 8 wks for a full month, wondering if it's a wise move to get vaccination just incase it does break out in TG?"
"Granny, it is not a vaccination now, it is taken in a drink twice within 6 weeks and then a third 6 months later as a top up booster. We did not pay anything for ours, presume it is down to your surgery whether they charge or not.Gary"
HigrannyIts called Dukoral and currently costs the NHS about £23 and is usually only free from NHS GP's to long term workers and visitors since short term holidaymakers are not considered at risk so long as they observe the usual health and hygiene precautions but in these circumstances with Gambia on alert your GP has discretion to treat you free of charge He/she probably doesnt know about this situation let us know how you get on rgds
"I'll try ring them tomorrow. Our GP is as tight as a ducks derriere so I bet they want to charge an arm and a leg, probably £15 for a private script plus cost of drug. Let you know what they say."
HiThe latest advise from the Gambian health authorities is that they dont recommend the purchase of the small plastic sachets of water that lots of us use until this alert is over rgds
Do they say why not?
"Granny, an article in today's Observer raised concerns about those sachets given the current cholera concerns, suggesting some of the water companies might be dodgy. See :-observer.gm/africa/…cholera-alert"
"Thank you for pointing out a good article John!Avoid handshaking this article says ""The Gambians are going to love that aren't they!"" Call me unfriendly but ""I just hate spending my day shaking hands every five minutes"" When a Colgate smile and friendly hello is a much better greeting and so much more hygienic than shaking hands!!!!Edited: 8 years ago "
Last year when I was in TG I was recovering from a broken shoulder and didn't shake a single hand. The shoulder is better now but I am not going to aggravate it with all that handshaking when I am there next month. 'Nanga def' will have to do.
"Been doing some research and apparently if its curently recomended then it SHOULD be free, but gp may still try to charge for private script. Interestingly all the sites we use travax - nathnac WHo etc have nothing on this topic that i can see, so you may be charged as it isnt actually being officially highlighted as a risk. No more than at any other time anyway. NAthnac says:"" Most travellers are at low risk. Those at higher risk include humanitarian aid workers and travellers with remote itineraries in areas of cholera outbreaks, who have limited access to safe water and medical care. ""Nothing on WHO re risk in gambia but an interesting article re Senegal where there have been some cases since 2005:who.int/cholera/countries/CountryProfileSene…I will keep digging and post if find anything else out x"
for info our practice charges £40 if not currently recommended so if you are charged it shouldnt be much more than that.
"if it did become high risk for everyone,how long before your holidays would it be advisable to take it?"
"Blue,For adults, two doses of oral vaccine are given within a 1-6 week interval, and this course must be completed with at least one week to go before exposure according to internet articles."
"We can practice good hygiene I sure that we know the basics that's what we were taught from an early age, we been brought up with hand washing etc.I just think that many hotels the staff don't have the cleaning agents, cloths etc available to them ( I will say this and the risk of being shot down it flames) but even in the good hotels there is no gaurantee that those that handle food wash their hands after going to the toilet and infact could shake hands with someone that is infected and further I will say that indeed many toilets I have visited in the various eateries have shared toilet facilities with the staff they haven't even got soap which is ok for us with our various wipes and bottle of instant handwash but not good really as these people put us at risk to all sorts least I suppose is Banjul belly which isn't so pleasant either!!....I have lived in a war torn country and have hit the deck with the rest of them when we seen people with guns just randomly shooting yes it been scarey but not quite as scarey as something you cannot see. Yep that makes me nervous but perhaps I over react!!!Edited: 8 years ago "
"Its a quandary Breezy, a retired nurse who volunteers lots of her time at a clinic ,is fighting a losing battle trying to get staff to stop nose picking,what hopes restaurantsA friend who worked in a restaurant described the lack of hygene in a well known kitchen,I never ate there againAs for shaking hands hhhmmm Interesting that the article did not include GAMWAT sachets in their article ,if I read it correctly though it said uninspected water, which is sold in bags direct from the tap ,seen round serrekunda, banjul bus garage and locals purchase for a dalasi"
Breezy I can't say for certain but I suspect that a smoking gun and cholera have pretty much the same effect on yer laundry.
"I may get shot down in flames here but as said if you follow basic rules of hygiene you should be OK. I have seen people use wipes every single time they come into contact with money,peoples hands etc,not necessary unless you're a nail-biter/thumb sucker/nose picker etc.Yes clean hands before eating with fingers & pour water from bottles into glasses or use straws.Always take re-hydration sachets with you and avoid uncooked food or food that cannot be peeled....Oh and have a happy & healthy holiday and enjoy.p.s. if you're not happy call a doc or visit a clinic"
"Hi Bruff It's always good to banter words with both you Riddimchef and many others on here as I always seem to get good feed back from you.I must admit the very word Cholera did frighten me a little. I will just say that my immune sytstem is (so they tell me!!) not good they say through a heart condition diagnosed when I was 44 years old, they make me queue with the elderly for the flu injections and if I don't have them 9 out of 10 times I do get really ill. I want to go on my holidays, I'm fed up of work and reading up on the Cholera it doesn't seem so bad but I now have to convince hubby who now thinks it may be a bad idea!!! I Usually book at the last minute and don't think that we have time for the vaccinations or what ever they are. Am I being sensible or should I just go to the Canaries which I might add is not hot enough for me but it a break away from the bedlam of work and I really need some sanity!! I would much rather be in my beloved Gambia as it a place I know and love! Sometimes we have such agonizing decisions to make in our lives and at a time we don't want to make themx!!"
"Breezy,You've got to go Gambia and just take the precautions suggested by Blue and you'll be fine.As to vaccinations for cholera, you take 2 oral dosages within 1- 6 weeks and must complete that course a week before you go - which sounds too late for you but you'll be alright anyway."
"breezy you can go anywhere in this world & catch an infection,disease or worse (even in this country) and with all the injections/vaccines,so take advice,take meds,be aware but don't go OTT on worrying and enjoy the holiday."
"Thanks John, I know that most of you have been going to The Gambia for quite some time, but about 18 times (over 6 years) I will catch up with all of you at some stage and even hope for a meet out there some day, but in the meantime thank you for all the advice given on this post and on previous posts it very much appreciated!And Chalkymik I am sure you were at Badala when we were 21st November to 30th November it a great pity we didn't meet!!Edited: 8 years ago "
Thanks Blue for your good sound advice and thank you irishadrian for posting this topic as it allows others to read and try and get some understanding of what going on. It can be quite daunting when there is an epidemic remember the epidemics we had here in the past couple of years both with animals and humans very nasty indeed!!!
Breezy. December 6th-13th . Maybe next time eh?
"Breezy look at from another angle. I have a crazy immune system that attacks my own body. For 2 yrs I was on a drug that suppressed immune system and therfore should have made be more vulnerable, I was told I had to go to a & e if in contact with chicken pox etc as would be dangerous for me. Well guess what? I had less colds, bugs whatever in those 2 yrs than normal. Figure that one out! We live in such a sterile world now that asthma, allergies, skin disorders etc are on the increase. Think of Gambia as topping up not deleting your immune system, too much sterility bad for you. As my Nana always said, 'bit of muck does you good, you never see a pig with belly ache' :)Edited: 8 years ago "
Go Gambia and follow rules and use alcohol wipes no probs :-)
"HiIm beginning to wish I hadnt posted this since I think people are more worried than they need to be Cholera outbreaks almost always begin where there is no proper sanitation ,washing facilities and clean running water and amongst locals without proper basic hygiene training What is worrying the Gambian authorities is that there have been a few cases around Koalack and Touba in Senegal and the Grand Magal at Touba starts 12/13th Jan when between 1-1.5 million will descend on Touba from all over West Africa for the mouride celebrations and this always includes several thousands from Gambia They usually camp out in a tent city around Touba so there is high potential if an outbreak occurs for returning pilgrims to bring it back with them. I dont believe the risk is great in the tourist area with proper sanitation facilities and forewarned tourists taking the necessary precautions rgds"
"Agreed Adrian, that's why the Gambian state has only advised precautions be taken by those of its public travelling to Senegal, with the rest of the public just advised to look out for the symptoms - so no real need for UK people going to Gambia to be unduly concerned as the cholera situation in Senegal stands at present. Everyone should just take the usual precautions as suggested by Blue."
"Irish don't think that, at first I thought when I saw cholera my god I thought they had eradicated that one, then I read up about it, of course there are many other unknown things that are much worse then cholera.Granny hit the nail on the head with ""a bit of muck does you good"" said in true yorkshire style!! Infact we have an allotment and my mother thinks if vegetables aint got some muck then there not fresh as you dig em out of the muck don't ya lass. I think that we all read a bit about our kids aren't getting enough muck, but of course there is muck and really mucky muck the latter of course is not good for you.We live in a very, modern clean filtered apartment and I have ailed here more than any where I lived, yep mucky, dusty Gambia is the place to be!!!"
So pack your bags Breezy !
"Hope one day to see there, John, blue, irish, granny, chalky not to mention all the rest of the crew..... I let you know when I booked it!!"
And of course not forgetting Bruff and Riddim too and many others!x
YaaaaaaaaaY !
"I'm very glad you posted it, Adrian. I printed out the government advice and the teachers are far more keen now to ensure the children wash their hands after using the toilet or before eating their snacks. I will also take a copy to the lower basic today"
