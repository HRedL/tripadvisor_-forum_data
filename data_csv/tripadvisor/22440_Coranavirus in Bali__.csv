I have an upcoming trip to Bali scheduled for March. Should I be concerned?
Please read every other post previous to yours. Type in Coronavirus into the search box and they will all appear.
"It’s entirety up to you if you want to be concerned, l also have a Bali trip planned for March and l couldn’t be bothered, lm not going to cancel."
"Janice, you are so right. I am typically not a Worry wort. I Have been looking forward to this trip, I don’t plan on canceling. :) happy and safe travels to you."
"My only concern really is my flight via Singapore but the airline sent me an email of confidence stating all their measures in place, think lm still going to take a mask just in case."
That Is a good idea. I plan on wearing a mask on my flight as well. Safe travels!
"Just wondering why people are wearing masks, when the medical profession says they are of absolutely no use in the Coronavirus situation. They are only of use to people who actually have the virus to stop transmitting it to others.When I have someone come in to work wearing a mask, I question them if they are contagious. It makes me think they are sick."
"That works only if the infected person is wearing a mask. If they are not wearing a mask and you might possibly get infected. We are still learning more about the virus, eg. men with beards may be more susceptible to those who are clean shaven.I actually went to the local lung hospital this morning. Almost every patient was wearing a mask and every staff member, nurse, admin and all the doctors seemed to be wearing a mask.The way I see it is better to be cautious, and of course use sanitizer frequently, I wore my PM2.5 mask and used the sanitizer 2 or 3 times while I was there.Edited: 1:04 am, February 28, 2020 "
"Hi,I am also traveling Bali on 6th April. Thankyou for asking this question."
My mate at work is 'worrying' about his planned trip to Bali in April. I said he should be more worried about our italian colleague who goes home to Italy most weekends. 2 Italians who live in Tirol Austria (near Innsbruck) went to Lombardy for the weekend to visit relatives and brought back the Corona Virus.Everything is relative.
"I really don’t care what people are saying regarding the mask situation, they must be of some help otherwise people and medical staff wouldn’t be bothered to wear them and they definitely wouldn’t be out of stock.I rather take some precautions while traveling through Singapore than taking my chances with nothing whatsoever, despite all the reassurance Singapore Airlines are telling me.Edited: 1:37 am, February 28, 2020 "
"Why are people wearing masks? Its called ""monkey see, monkey do"". Surgical masks are worn by surgeons so as to reduce the risk of them infecting their patients, not vice versa. Surgical patients are usually far more vulnerable to infection than healthy people. The other reason for surgical masks is to protect the doctor from the spraying of blood and other bodily fluid when incisions are made (surgery can be very messy).People are wearing masks because they are ill-informed and because there is peer pressure to do so."
"I went to the lung clinic this morning and most of the patients and most of the staff from admin to cashiers and nurses to cleaners to doctors were all wearing masks. None of them were carrying out operations at the time. I don't think it was peer pressure either but perhaps the doctors and nurses were just ill informed. This lung clinic is the kind of place that deals with TB patients amongst others. And when you register on arrival, they actually hand you a mask which they didn't do last November when I visited.Other people who also wear masks include surfboard shapers, bodywork repairers, people working with asbestos, and anyone working in a dusty environment.Well I wore my PM2.5 this morning, not particularly because of people that might have coronavirus, but also because of things like tuberculosis and the like.Also, when I watch the so-called experts from the WHO and other top level organizations I saw many of them wearing masks. They weren't performing any operations at the time either."
"More coronavirus threads? Really needs another thread? I think not.Edited: 2:50 am, February 28, 2020 "
Juzza couldn't agree more
I am going to Bali in one week. I am not wearing a mask. they are totally ridiculous. there is filtered air on the plane. What are you going to do when they bring you a meal on the plane. You will need to remove the mask to eat and drink. and what happens then??? do you think the virus will wait until you finish eating and put on your mask again.
hahaha Millie - perhaps if people build an airtight straw into the mask they could at least drink on the flight.

"Going to SEA : Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia (Jakarta and Bali, and Japan.Not concerned with coronavirus at all!"
"That's pretty naive. I am still planning to travel in 2 weeks, but to say I am not concerned at all would be ridiculous. Of course I'm concerned."
"I think the key to deciding whether Bali remains a viable destination currently is to weigh up formal travel and heath advice and also ascertain whether you have any existing health issues that may place you at risk should this virus flare up in Bali. Additionally, it’s worth checking with your GP for advice."
"Ironically UK has now listed Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand as second tier high risk areas (after China, Japan, South Korea in higher risk areas) where people should be concerned if they develop/show any symptoms. Indonesia/Bali not on the second tier risk list."
"Garuda Indonesia makes many new direct flights to Indonesia and if I'm not forget there are also flight to Brisbane. But not to Europe, because Garuda Indonesia has not so many wide body aircraft. One of it is rented by government to evacuate Indonesian crews of Diamond Princess Cruise Ship from Haneda Airport Japan about 20 kilometers from Yokohama Port. The evacuation will be done tomorrow. So, the wide body can directly fly to Indonesia."
"Once again, you give information based on your incessant googling, but no real knowledge.At this time Garuda do not fly direct to Brisbane but are hoping to open a route linking Denpasar with BrisbaneTake a break from this topic Sarwa, please."
"NotapigstyI take it that Indonesia isn't on a UK list because they don't ""have"" any confirmed cases."
