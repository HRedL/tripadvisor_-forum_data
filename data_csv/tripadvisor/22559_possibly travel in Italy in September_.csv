"Already book the flight coming to Italy in mid September this year, this is my first time to Europe,consider the currently situation do you think is it doable to travel in Italy in September this year?As someone from Asia to travel here this year would risking to be treated differently ?Edited: 1:54 pm, March 29, 2020 "

"I agree with MCat. My personal thought, though, is I would not travel to Italy (or anywhere) this year but of course no one knows that far ahead."
You will be burning the candle at both ends with three matches and three wicks. Playing with fire is not for you. Re-draw or reschedule your travel plans for Italy and do not undergo hasty preparations for going there in September and preserve your money and heath. The distance would be far too great for spending money on such an endeavor. Far too risky now to undertake an endeavor for drawing up travel plans which will not be feasible later. It is not doable from stand point of safety. Reschedule your travel plans for beyond this calendar year. Un-refundable costs make it not a wise decision. Remain informed about this situation later.
I think #3 is saying no don't even think about it this year.It'll be a long long before any kind of normality returns worldwide.Stay safe
"Just watching BBC World News, the UK Health spokesperson said that some level of shutdown and social isolation will probably last the next 6 months, although probably not at full shutdown levels. So that takes it into October. Considering that Italy is in worse condition than the UK (at least so far) we are adapting to the conclusion that our 40th Anniversary trip from Venice to Sicily is almost certainly a no go. As she said we will relook at the situation every 3 weeks but for our travel to be possible it would have to be for a miracle.We are in constant contact with friends in Teramo and so far all the news has been nothing but sad."
"in my opinion, looking at Italian news reports there having big issues with this virus, I don't see the Italian borders open for tourism from abroad well into the new year"
"holachica1, the county is dealing with the virus. According to reports the number of cases has slowed for the last several days so it looks like they may have a handle on it and have been able to contain iy so may very well see an end to this in the next month or two. When they do see an end to it and things get back to normal what they are going to need is tourists spending money there. What they don't need is someone on a travel forum trying to scare people away for the next year. We should stop giving our opinions on when things ""may"" get back to normal and simply go by official reports. People are on lock down, the number of new cases has slowed over the past several days and supplies and help are being flown in. Donna"
"I had booked to go to Thailand in 2004 I booked 3 days before the tsunami hit .I was going to cancel / contacted the hotel to find out what to do , they begged us to come .We went . If we had not the manager informed us later the bar across the road had only been able to feed his kids because of the 10 couples in the hotel the same with the local restaurants and a antique shop . So I would urge everyone to travel to Italy /Spain as soon as it all clear . Wishing everyone good health ."
"https:/…Since March 19th, new case have been above 5000 per day except for 1 day.It would be nice for anyone making statements as facts, to back them up. I am already booked for late September and HOPE to go. Also, I have been talking to my wife about booking the same trip we just missed (Tuscany), For late November.We all want the best. Italy is suffering. They will let us know when they are ready for tourists."

"haters just delete my post on this forum, 110% you will be travelling to Italy in September that's what my crystal ball says today I think it's giving great advice."
It’s not just when Italy opens its doors to tourism but when your own home country is healthy and therefore you are free to travel that should be the barometer. The last thing anyone wants is an infected person traveling to another country. It will take time for the world to recover....
Some posters seem to be disaster posters - showing up only when some terrible situations are occurring - and then post all the doomsday stuff they can think of - it seems like a bit of a compulsion People can read for themselves what is occurring - I doubt many aware adults are getting their news (let alone heeding advice from) about this tragic worldwide situation from a bunch of strangers on an anonymous travel forum
@14 people are posting fake news on this forum they are sugar-coating the situation in Italy it's not fair to those that have a question its an open forum as long as you follow the TA guidelines regular posters on this fourm are deleting post if it does not fill their agenda.
I haven’t noticed anybody “sugar coating” anything....
"so post #7 is not fake news ? looks like they got a handle on it so does NYC has a handle on it to date. @16 and the are 4 haters on this forum, I know how they are they just delete my post because it does not meet there agenda on this forum. ^^^Edited: 11:52 am, March 31, 2020 "
Maybe we could do something about this.Look at # 2https:/…world-hunger-statistics.html
"That is part of our dilemma, knowing how bad things are still and will be for quite awhile, and also wanting to be there to see friends and help revive the country. WE are keeping a close watch on the situation but not feeling very hopeful. Even after hitting the peak on the new cases there will still be many new cases as the curve gradually gets back down to zero. The peak is not the end. And to make it worse a former studnet of ours told us that her parents in Nanjing were able to go back to work after over 50 days os isolation in their apartment , but there has now been a jump in the new cases. Hopefully it will not last. So much we don't know about how this will play out. After a big flood in the 90s along the Iowa River we tried to go and visit as many restaurants as possible, but there once the flooding was gone, we knew what the situation was and there was no ongoing danger."
"There is no “fake news” in post #7. Just the truth of the current situation and a little hope for the future... nothing wrong with hoping, imho.Only one person appears to be spouting nonsense in this thread (and many other threads I’ve noticed of late). One small example of such nonsense being “110%”. There is no such thing..."

"Since you already booked your flights, just keep yourself informed. If you want to book any accommodation, make sure they can be canceled without charge."
The government is implying that post Easter the lockdown will start being lifted in stages. I'd expect hotels to be near the end of the list but by summer everything tourist related might/hopefully will be open.Does that mean your airline will be flying? Many European airlines are grounded to at least then. Others might be bankrupt.Does that mean your country will have opened up?Final point depending on which guesses you listen to large parts of the Italian population have already had the virus and dealt with it. By summer it's likely the vast majority will have had it. No point keeping things closed.
"This article, originally posted by Raffaele, indicates things may be a long way off and depend on medication to fight the virus or a vaccine to protect against it: adnkronos.com/fatti/…I have a trip planned Sept 4 - Oct 6 to mark a milestone life event but increasingly feel it may not happen. At least not this year."
https://www.democracynow.org/2020/3/31/headl…There are reports that the number of cases has started to decrease each day. This is good news and may signal a change in the situation and that the confinement is working. Let's keep our fingers crossed.Donna
"Thank you for supporting Italy.I am sorry but is too early to tell when an exit strategy from quarantine will be possible. Not before the mid of April or after Easter if you prefer, will be possible to make an attendible prediction.It is not like turning the light on or off.

I’ve been wanting to thank you Raffaele for your continuity in reporting and your wise observations....you have contributed a lot on this subject in the forums...stay strong and healthy...and my deep affection to Italy...
"Hopefully things are better by September, but no telling with how things are playing out right now."
booked my flight back in january to travel to barcelona then to rome for the beginning of june... not having high hopes at all that i will be heading to either places
I sure wish the best for one of my favorite countries. But we don't know what exactly will happen. Even for a cure the majority of experts say that a COVID-19 vaccine will happen earliest in 18 months. Another expert says it may be sooner should his vaccine trial work well with his subjects. Also the consensus is hinting that the virus may reappear in the fall/winter seasons.
"IMO, an accurate assessment of COVID-19 and the human toll / response to the virus well may be 10-15 years from now. The only thing each of us can do is listen/adhere to what experts, scientists and/or MDs advise. Their guidance will make the difference for many of us. God willing, politicians will echo what infectious disease specialists advise. Patience, adherence and do one thing each day that gives you joy.A solo/sola walk through the neighborhood or nearby park (adhering to 6' distance & using a face mask, of course); making a dish for dinner you love; baking Mom's cookies or brownies; making a cocktail or pouring a glass of wine with dinner (not the bottle); posting on a mirror the 3 things you're grateful for today each day - or tape that to doors for you & the family to read; play music; dance in the living room & have your children/spouse join you; email or call a friend/family you haven't seen in a while; read a book you haven't read in years; draw; sketch, pray, if you do, etc.This is the time we take care of ourselves, our family, friends & neighbors. May we all step up to the plate safely & remain safe & healthy throughout.FWIW, what helps me is remembering those who lived long before me through far more difficult circumstances than COVID-19. My ancestors walked this walk years ago and demonstrated how its done. May I/we honor their hard work & sacrifice today. My two cents,Globe"
"Your wise words are worth a lot more than two cents, Globe.I'm desperately sad that we can't travel to Italy or one of our other favourite countries, but there's nothing that can be done about that and both my wife and I are a bit fearful of going anywhere this year. Or, more likely, until there is a vaccine.But our feelings of sadness are insignificant when it comes to the world wide scale of suffering that this virus has caused."
"The only hope for a quicker change for the good than expected now might come from the start of summer. Like most corona viruses this one will hopefully go away when the days are longer so there is more UV light, the weather gets warmer and more humid. If it proves true, then there may be a fast drop off in late May-June. We can only hope this happens the way it does for seasonal flu. Unfortunately if it is seasonal, that could mean a return next late Fall-early winter when the flu season restarts. With lots of luck there might be a vaccine by then."
Also keep in mind they are having great results using hyroxychloroquine along with some other drugs. Let's keep our fingers crossed that this proves to be the drug that will combat this virus.Donna
"Hi DonnaThere are other drugs too. In Chieti, where I live, there is an important University of Medicine connected to the hospital. The first patient cured with Tocilizumab has been threatened and he recovered well. Here is the interviewhttps://www.ilcentro.it/chieti/chieti-parla-…Google translated""Still now I don't know where, how and when I contracted the virus, no matter how much it tried to give me answers. It just happened, and asking questions beyond a certain limit was not helpful. "" An ex-patient of Chieti's infectious diseases speaks. He won his battle against the virus: he was the first patient discharged in Abruzzo after being treated with the experimental drug Tocilizumab. He gave his consent and the journey began, now he can tell his experience. He does it in a video interview broadcast by the ASL Lanciano-Vasto-Chieti.He is 30 years old. ""When you're there you're afraid not only for yourself, he says, but for those who are at home and you are afraid of getting infected. I was tormented by the thought of being a cause of suffering for the people I love most and whom I never wanted to endanger, ""he says. ""There comes a time when you think of only one thing - remember - and that is that you have to improve your condition, only that is worth it. My life has definitely changed - he confides -, these are situations that make you think and I have had time to think about it in the hospital. And yes, I changed all right. Everyone should learn something these days, because everyone's life has changed. """
Grazie Raffaele for your encouraging post- stay safe and healthy.
"Hi ElenaListening to the news it seems the situation in NY is far from good.Please stay safe, take care and stay at home if you canCheers"
"It may be awhile before it is clear that any of the drugs that are being used are actually a cure or help promote a cure. so far they are only being used as part of a regimen of treatments and it will require more cases and comparisons to establish they are of use. it is possible that they have no effect at all in the recovery that could have been spontaneous or just the result of the rest of the treatment . hopefully we will know more in the next month from the studies Dt. Fauci who is the US expert is cautious about the value of hyroxychloroquine at this point. Especially since it only is used when the patient is already quite ill. A group of researchers in Ireland have completed a study which seem to show that a vaccine given for TB, malaria and measles in poorer countries seem to significantly reduce occurrence of the virus and the death rates by a factor of 10. If further study proves it true, it would be an available vaccine many months before a COVID19 vaccine is allowed on the market. Which would be really a great step forwatd."
"HiI'm hoping beyond hope that a major breakthough is announced soon for a vaccine. There are more than 20 vaccines currently in development. Trials are taking place in the UK using an anti-viral called Remdesivir. Apparently it's an Ebola drug, but seems to work against a wide variety of viruses.The trial for HIV drugs (Lopinavir and Ritonavir) is disappointing.Then there is an anti-malarial drug called Chloroquine. Apparently, it can kill the virus but the WHO says there is no real evidence of this.Eddie"
"While things will hopefully be much better by September, I think that until there is a vaccine and everyone is vaccinated, this virus will continue to be an issue, there will be periodic outbreaks, like during the polio years, and travel will be chancy.For example, there could be a sudden outbreak in your home area or at your destination. Countries, and when they start flying again, airlines, might impose new restrictions on travelers, requiring some sort of proof that you aren't infected and/or are not an asymptomatic carrier/spreader of the virus. Trip insurers will refuse to cover anything related to the virus, so you need to be okay with that if you were going to count on insurance.Edited: 7:29 pm, April 07, 2020 "
"I agree completely. I gave up the idea of booking a flight for this year, I think that for a long, long time, we will have to travel inside our countries. But vaccine will come soon or late.Well it's an occasion to get to know your country better, for example I still miss the little islands of Sicily. If not now, when? :)"
"As a follow-up to posting #41 above, I also see the public transportation issue as being a ""key"" to a resolution of this crisis. Flying in an airplane across the ocean (or even on a shorter flight) presents at a minimum the perception of danger to both flight attendants and passengers. Without assurances that everyone on board is free of Coronavirus, how many people will be willing to ""take the chance""? Will passengers be willing to wear a face mask for the entire duration of the flight? Will they be willing to refrain from eating for 12 hours? How comfortable will they be sitting next to a stranger? (Practicing social distancing on a passenger plane is economically not possible, unless ticket prices are tripled or quadrupled). I suspect that, in the future, boarding a commercial flight will require not only a passport or national identity card, but also proof of recent vaccination against Coronavirus (or perhaps the presence of antibodies). The other possibility would be to employ a super-fast Coronavirus test during passenger check-in at the airport, to establish negativity to the virus (even here, the rate of false negatives might be unacceptably high).In the final analysis, the Coronavirus crisis may adversely affect the airline industry for a long time, rendering the economics of air travel even more challenging. I suspect that the era of super-large passengers planes may be at an end. We may go back to smaller wide-bodied planes and single-aisle aircraft. And what happens if an effective vaccine is never found?"
"Bill Gates was on PBS Newshour last night and announced he was gettong several plants ready to produce a vaccine once one is shown to be effective and safe. His analysis is that there will be some semblance of normality in a few months but continued restrictions to guard against a second wave or recurrence when flu season returns. He does not feel things will be totally back to normal until next fall after a vaccine is widespread. (unfortunately for his charities anti-malarial program, the researchers in that area have been switched over to COVID19 vaccine research)."
"""And what happens if an effective vaccine is never found?""Everybody will catch it. The question is do you become immune after the infection."
"Re post #43, I have friends who took evacuation flights this week home to Europe from Asia wearing masks and gloves for 10+ hours having been permitted to board only after passing a rigorous health test both in advance and later at the gate. They both commented that this was possibly “the new norm” in airline travel. There was a spare seat between all passengers in economy so a 777 flew effectively with half the payload. They paid over the odds for their one way ticket but were so keen to get home, money wasn't an issue. However, if the same economics apply, it could potentially mean higher air fares for all going forward. In the same way that the terrorists won post 9/11 and various other attacks – as anyone in the queue at security will concede - clearly the virus has the upper hand now when it comes to travelling."
"Re post # 46:Your information is interesting; nevertheless, I would not compare an ""evacuation flight"" with future discretionary air travel. Will passengers be willing to wear face masks for up to 16 hours? For 8 hours? Will children be cooperative? Meals will need to be served (or passengers bringing their own food), which means people remove their masks and open their mouths. Leaving an empty seat between passengers is not sufficient: the two-meter social distancing norm requires leaving at least FOUR empty seats between passengers in economy class (each seat is less than 18 inches wide), and at least one or two open rows.Will passengers feel comfortable even if everyone wears a face mask? (Should one feel safe wearing a seat belt on a car with faulty breaks)?A recent news report stated that on an Alitalia 777-200, this means no more than 76 passengers for 293 seats, or an occupancy rate of roughly 25%. This is economically not feasible, unless air fares are TRIPLED. How much will passenger traffic decline under these conditions? What impact does this have on low-cost carriers? (I note that Lufthansa has permanently shut down its low-cost subsidiary Germanwings).It seems to be that, in the absence of an effective vaccine or instantaneous Coronavirus testing at the airport with a very low false negative rate, the future of air travel is very uncertain in the near term. Even the achievement of ""herd immunity"" may be insufficient, since nobody knows the duration of such ""immunity"" (or for that matter, the duration of any vaccine).The glory days of cheap air travel may be over."
"Per the new rules in Tuscany, we are not allowed to leave the house now without a mask. Although I have my own, the govt very kindly sent me some more through the mail this morning. I guess I can live with one over my mouth for maybe a couple of hours if sitting down doing nothing but beyond that they can cause an irritation, especially in people who may have an allergy sensitivity, nasal congestion. Do they work? Do they provide a false sense of security? I'm not qualified to say but I do know I will be wearing mine as required by law, possibly long after and definitely every time I fly in future. No question."
HiI just shared a video from a guy coming back home in Milano from New York.Interesting to know what it means to fly nowadayshttps:/…106305029Hope it helps
"# 48:I too am no expert. I do wonder, however, whether wearing a double surgical mask offers appreciably and demonstrably greater protection, especially in a closed environment such as a grocery store, medical waiting room, bus, metro, train or airplane? (This assuming that a double mask is tolerable)."
The idea behind the masks is to stop you infecting others. There is a study out of Iceland that found 50% of the people who tested positive had zero symptoms. A second large group had mild symptoms.People like that are wandering around with no idea
Until recently doctors here were saying only those who were showing symptoms or who had tested positive for the virus should be wearing a mask. They said no one else should wear a mask as it gives a false sense of security. They recently gave the recommendation that everyone should consider wearing a mask.Donna
"If everybody wears a mask in closed environments, the odds of shedding the virus should decline, at least intuitively, possibly by double digits (?). This is especially important on public transportation such as buses, metros and trains. If the 50% rate of asymptomatic cases is even close to being accurate, this is a critical issue.Use of masks is more problematic on flights in excess of 5 hours, since people need to drink and eat. When they remove the masks and open their mouths, the risk of contagion increases. What if someone starts coughing or sneezing during meal time? Are other passengers willing to run this risk? Enforcing social distancing on airplanes is not economically efficient, since air fares would need to triple.Of course, certain venues such as restaurants, bars, cafes, bistros, nightclubs, gymnasiums, dance halls, etc. do not lend themselves to wearing masks. How will society deal with these venues?Other industries, such as leisure cruise ships, seem destined to go belly up, in the absence of an effective vaccine or immediate, strongly reliable testing.Then there is the question of governmental restrictions. Just today, for example, the Austrian foreign minister was reported to have said that Austria should not reopen its frontiers to non-residents until the Coronavirus pandemic significantly wanes WORLDWIDE. This means NO TOURIST ENTRIES!!!!"
"You only have to wear the mask when you are near people who might be breathing out, sneezing or coughing out the virus and to protect others from you blowing on them in case you might be infected (and not know it). If you are outside away from others you can not breath in or out any virus. If you are home alone there is nobody to infect you and nobody to infect. If you are with others and you have all hibernated for over 14 days you can't infect or be infected by the others who are also clear of virus. In those cases you do not need to wear the mask. In Paraguay where they are terrified of an outbreak because of the inadequate medical facilities and poverty conditions, you are required to wear a mask when you go outside the house. In fact some stores are spraying people's clothing down with alcohol before you can enter. In a few weeks, we should have tests to tell who has already had the virus and may be safe from infection in the future although it is not clear yet if they can still transmit the virus to others later on and how long the immunity, if any, will last. Who knows, airlines may have special flights for people who has passed those tests and can fly more like we did before (little restrictions). But there is so little we know about those who are asymptomatic and those with antibodies at this point. Otherwise I can not imagine people wanting to fly with the restrictions airlines are forced to require now in the middle of a pandemic. Many of the initial anti-terrorism rules were dropped or made lenient pretty quickly. The discouraging news is that the original study of the anti-malarial drug has been withdrawn because it was not done up to standards. Apparently patients who were not improving with the medication were taken off it and not counted in the study so it looked more effective than it was, if at all. Also the expert panel in DC are of the opinion that the virus is not seasonal so will not suddenly go away in May. And yet we went shopping today for the first time in over a week and found about 40% of the shoppers were not wearing masks or gloves. I guess it's up to the rest of us to try to stifle the epidemic."
"EddieandLynn-- Apparently the report about the use of that malaria drug has been withdrawn because it was learned that patients who were not doing any better on it, were taken off of it and the reported results only reflected those who did well while taking it (without clearly knowing why) and a few whose doctors didn't take them off it when it was not working. The med does have some side effects and it's availability for lupus patients is critical . A number of US doctors have been prescribing the med to people (mainly family) as a protective med despite the lack of evidence that it works for those who are sick or those not yet sick. In one case a Dentist wrote a RX for the med for a family member! So pharmacies are getting emptied."
"Andrew, could you please provide the link or a reference to the source confirming your statement below?“Apparently the report about the use of that malaria drug has been withdrawn because it was learned that patients who were not doing any better on it”"
"I have plane tickets for early Oct. Haven't booked hotels. We won't be going. Hope Delta will give me a credit, but I booked with awards points, so I might lose out,"
"Yes, Andrew, can you provide a link to this information because all the information I've read or heard has been the opposite. In fact, one administrator I spoke with the other day said patients in their hospital are doing well on the drug. One man was very sick and within 4 hours of receiving the drug was doing much better. She also stated the drug was only being used on those who were very sick but that those patients were responding very well to it. Donna"
"""You only have to wear the mask when you are near people who might be breathing out, sneezing or coughing out the virus and to protect others from you blowing on them in case you might be infected (and not know it).""Not here you don't, since earlier this week by law no one in Tuscany is allowed to leave their house for any purpose whatsoever without wearing a mask, a requirement that has been in place (I believe) for a while in Lombardia and the Veneto. So, taking rubbish to the bins at dead of night with zero chance of meeting anyone on the street, must wear a mask. Walking the dog at first light on a deserted footpath in open countryside, must wear a mask. And we're wearing them too. (I also wear latex gloves.)"
My local supermarket (Conad) is now mandating masks and gloves to go grocery shopping. The pharmacy when they have them will sell you up to two at a time. Reusing the same infected mask isn't a great idea. Making it impossible for people to go grocery shopping isn't a great one either.I get the impression somebody hasn't thought all this out.
Toosoon.
Many U.S. supermarkets no longer allow shoppers to bring in their own reusable shopping bags (paper or plastic) for fear of potentially spreading COVID-10. Businesses are doing their best to mitigate exposure to (for) all of usAnd agree with #62. We won't be able to travel abroad for quite a while.
"Andrew, could you please provide the link or a reference to the source confirming your statement below?Unfortunately this was reported on NPR radio or POTUS on Sirus XM. Was in the car at the time and don't remember which or the exact program But check these:https://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/govt-…INVESTORS DAILYBut the drug didn't pan out in the study, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat said in a note to clients. He described the results as ""far from positive."" Of three key measures, just one favored the use of the malaria drugs in coronavirus treatment.""It really puzzles me why we're seeing inaccurate characterizations of clinical data,"" Raffat said. ""In my honest opinion, having an honest discussion around emerging clinical data would actually help the progress.""Covid-19 Study Doesn't Bode WellThe hydroxychloroquine study examined virological clearance — the medicine's ability to lower how much of the virus remains in the body. After a week, the placebo cleared 93% of the virus vs. 87% clearance for those who received hydroxychloroquine, Raffat said.Further, patients' temperatures normalized on the same day for both groups.Only radiological progression measured by CT scan favored hydroxychloroquine in coronavirus treatment. But the data are hard to interpret due to the small number of patients, Raffat said. He questioned the dosage and patients' baseline viral loads. That information wasn't disclosed."
"""""Many U.S. supermarkets no longer allow shoppers to bring in their own reusable shopping bags (paper or plastic) for fear of potentially spreading COVID-10.""""oUR ShopRite HAS TAKEN A DIFFERENT TACT. If you bring in your own bags, the cashier will not help to pack them You will have to do it yourself. If you agree to use the store plastic bags from the roll, the cashier or a bagger can do the bagging."
"Our former exchange student has texted me that they have been on lock-down since March 7 because the Health Minister recognized they were too poor to beat an epidemic and the only hope was to limit it as much as possible. Airports were closed quickly for departing and arriving planes They are allowed out only for medical reasons and food shopping. Yesterday she went to a small shop to buy milk and as well as requiring a mask to enter, they sprayed everyone down with 80% alcohol. Later that day her 70+ father was pulled over by the police and had to show them he had grocery bags in the trunk (boot) of the car so they didn't fine him"
"This is interesting to me. I brought my own two bags this week which haven't been touched in probably a year so that I wasn't touching a cart. I carried them through the store putting my food into them and then rebagging them myself. I would think that's safer than using bags other people may have touched and touching a cart that has been through multiple hands, no?"
https:/…https://news.yahoo.com/detroit-rep-says-hydr…Seems like there's a lot of competing information out there about the drug and its effectiveness. Donna
"Some, not all supermarkets in the UK are providing sanitiser or wipes at the trolley pick up point."
"Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte held a press conference this evening, during which he announced a continuation of the ""lockdown"" until at least May 4, with only a few new exceptions.In answering a question, he specifically addressed the topic of tourism to note that it is currently not possible to reopen the country to tourism without rendering vain all the efforts heretofore expended to limit the spread of the virus. He did not specify WHEN tourism might be resumed, but implied that this would probably be among the LAST activities to start up again."
"September? After 1 hell of a month that has made our cities a DESERT we are only seeing the start of the path that leads to the flat part of the curve of contagion. As every expert repeats every day, if we reopen, it will start again. In order to restart activities, completely new rules have to be set. Everything has to be rearranged. Tourism as we know it will not exist anymore: would anyone ever board a plane, or a cruise ship? or have breakfast in a hotel? And anyway (as I wrote here after 1 day of lockdown) Italy will have to take strong decisions about borders. This is the real story, until the vaccine. And this is what Conte was meaning tonight."
"Pier, if it's any comfort the UK is shut down too.It's going to be a long time before we get back to any kind of normality, worldwide."
"**Tourism as we know it will not exist anymore: would anyone ever board a plane, or a cruise ship? or have breakfast in a hotel?**I will. Once this is under control and they have a vaccine for this virus I won't have any issues with things getting back to normal. To think that the world won't be the same again is, for me, a stretch.Donna"
"Here are some Australian documents sourced from medical journals, not newspapers, regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine.

"I could not agree more with your post 73, Donna. I will be traveling in the future and firmly believe that our doctors and researchers all over the world will come up with the vaccine."
"Allowing tourists to travel in Italy will be the last step of many others to be taken before. 15% of the Italian economy relies on tourism and travels, not to say restaurants and other activities. Every single day without tourists is a big loss for a lot of people. Unfortunately, we are still only planning the first step of the lockdown exit strategy.If a vaccine or a reliable drug will not be available soon, in summer will only be possible to sunbath on the beach (maybe) but only wearing gloves and mask. Impossible to take a bath or to swim in a pool.The following is a nice interview to Professor Ricciuto about our future holidays, on residents and tourists future holidayshttps://www.ilmessaggero.it/salute/medicina/…Sorry, in Italian. Please, use an on line translator"
"Yes that sounds realistic, in the seaside town where I go in the south, for example, it seems beaches admissions will have to be 1/3 than before. How can they manage to survive I don't know. Sunbed and umbrella will cost a lot more I guess. At least some natural sites will be protected and respected a bit more... I'm ready to pay for that"
"Just a guess but I think there will have to be a full restructuring of the world s economy .If not the poor will not be able to survive .Even the middle class will not have the money they had after this .So I can see travel for holidays becoming a thing of the past .Much like the 1960sEdited: 5:03 am, April 12, 2020 "
Thanks RaffaeleNot disheartened .We have already been in touch with our friends in the Parco De Principle in Rome and the Excelsior in Venice .Informing them we will be coming over as soon as possible / safe
"HiA vaccine has been discovered at Oxford University and might be available by Sept. https:/…It's said that half of the UK population might have already had the virus without knowing too much about it and the government hopes to limit the death toll to less than 20k. If we assume no successful vaccine is found and lockdown continues indefinitely leading to the UK economy totally collapsing leaving debt, bankruptcy and poverty, it's thought that 150k will die from drug abuse, alcoholism, domestic violence and malnutrition etc.  This figure is a lot higher than the figure that might die from coronavirus therefore a compromised solution has to be found. The world's economies cannot possibly recover from this self-induced coma if the lockdown is not partially lifted sooner rather than later. My guess is that vulnerable people will remain in lockdown while the healthy under fifties, or whatever, go back to work and school. Eddie"
Trump said .We have to watch that the cure is not worse than the virus itself .Which I believe could be true .
"So, if the british government will start producing the vaccine before it is proven effective, and if they distribute it globally and if all other governments accept the vaccine not proven effective, we'll be reopening autumn 2020 and not in the commonly estimated 15 months. This is said in the interview.More or less I read something similar on newspaper here in Italy, one week after things got really scary, to tranquilize people.Edited: 10:07 am, April 12, 2020 "
"I really cannot see the British govt. starting mass production of an unproven vaccine, can you?"
"Eddie, I agree with your post wholeheartedly and fully trust Professor Gilbert’s team working on the vaccine. Kudos to her! Similar news about the vaccine are coming from many countries in the world (US, UK, Israel, France) and they give people much needed hope. We cannot and should not live in the lockdown mode forever. It is dangerous and destructive for all. Happy Easter and Happy Passover to all!Nora"
HiYes I can because these are desperate times and require desperate measures. Eddie
"Thanks Nora Happy Easter and Happy Passover to you and everyone. And Boris is out of hospital, hooray! Eddie"
"I just cannot see a govt. allowing an unproven vaccine to be used on the general population until All the testing has been done and it's proved to be safe, and have no long term detrimental effects.Remember thalidomide?"
"Haddaway if you questioned me, I don't believe it either, I was ironic. I have read dozens of interviews about how long for a worldwide vaccination. And about how long for reopening of borders, we can learn from how China's reacting now to the back wave.One thing is hope (or Faith) no comment on that, other thing is being silly. Anyway, funny how newsflow is organised the same in all countries.Edited: 11:17 am, April 12, 2020 "
Hydroxycholorquine is used on Lupus patients and is safe to use. There have been no side effects noted on the hundreds of cases of corona that it's been used on. The results on those patients is astounding. Hopefully this will be the answer.Donna
Sorry dbabe but there is no comprehensive or conclusive data on its efficacy . Trump seems to think that because it works with malaria then it will work with covid19. Malaria is a different organism than the Sars virus.Why is Trump apparently pushing hyroxychloroquine? Has he got shares in one of the drug companies?There is no research on its efficacy except a small french study with 20 patients which is hardly a large study.Sorry i have digressed from the question origially raisedAs with all drugs there are side effects
"There have been hundreds and hundreds of cases in different countries where they have used hydroxychloroquine and it's worked. I can't remember if it was New York or Maine but the drug was given to 350 of the worst patients and all of them recovered, many showing great improvement within hours. Why is everyone so against at least trying this drug? Why assume the President has some ulterior motive to suggesting it other than he wants to find a cure and this one seems promising?The President believes it will work because of the results doctors from around the world are sharing. Malaria is just ONE of the many things this drug treats. It's also used as a treatment for Lupus, which is why it was suggested in the first place. We don't have to agree on this. We are all sharing our opinions based on the information we've been given. Donna"
Hydroxychloroquine is only under investigation in clinical trials. Usually a drug only in testing isn't widely prescribed even if effective on other conditions.https:/…therapeutic-options.htmlVagabonda
"And about travel resuming...Prime Minister Conte extended the lockdown until 4 May during his 10 April press conference, and then indicated the hope for a gradual restart in the country.Conte specifically addressed the topic of tourism indicating the risk of infections increasing from those arriving from other countries, and so there will be no tourism until Italy is ready, and that's only after many other issues are first addressed.https:/…Then there's also conditions and restrictions in other countries to consider, the uncertainty of the airline industry, issues with social distancing during flights, and possible requirement to self-quarantine for 14 days on arrival.Vagabonda"
"Italy is my favorite country on earth. I’ve spent at least one month a year there for many years. Despite my deep longing to experience their culture, language, seeing people whom I have befriended there, food, Italian way of life, and wanting to spend money to help support the fruit and vegetable couple, the local hotels and apartment owners, and all the rest, it’s ultimately about their safety and ours. I have resigned myself to the idea that my travel to Italy will wait for 2021.I’ve been so saddened about the situation that this is the first time that I’ve come back to the Tripadvisor forum in a couple of months, hoping to see that Vagabonda and other Italian posters are hopefully healthy and coping well, as much as is possible.Edited: 12:55 pm, April 13, 2020 "
"Yes dbabe we don't have to agree but if you state "" there are hundreds and hundreds of different countries where they have used hydroxychloroquine and it's worked "" you need to back that statement up with evidence. Going back to original question , Italy I am sure will welcome back tourists from abroad when it is ready. I hope that everyone is continuing to stay well and safe."
"dbabe…..LOL,lol,lol,"
"Supermarkets vary so much. Our Shoprite now says that if you bring your own bags you will have to bag the groceries without help. If you chose the plastic bags (which are machine made and not touched up to that point, the cashier or bagboy will help. One market set up a system that can pick up carts, dunk them in antiseptic and rinse bins before putting the back for use. Our local Giant sprays down the carts before you can use them, which Costco does and makes sure nobody takes a cart from the parking lot that hasn't been resprayed. I did see the BBC interview with the Italian PM Conte. He also said that any reopening will come in stages and progress depending on infection rates. So it sounds like parts of the country may reopen or loosen up but could close again if there is a spike in cases because of the loosening. That happened in Singapore, after starting to reopen they had the highest one day spike so far. WE are thinking that even if tourism reopened and we figured we could be there and be careful enough to avoid contamination, our concern would still be the flights."
"#93 wow...I would expect a DE for Rome to stay on topic and not become a medical expert. The information posted is so very wrong and misleading. There are many many side effects for this drug that is being discussed for off label use. In fact it is counter-indicated for anyone with heart issues which are many victims of Covid. As others have indicated tourism for 2020 is not really going to happen.Edited: 6:49 pm, April 13, 2020 "
"From what I’ve read in the NY Times, the limited trials of this drug produced irregular heart beats and test trials were stopped. Now that’s just today’s news and everything changes daily.

HiSome people have faith in scientists finding the answer soon because 2021 bookings for cruise ships have risen by 40% recently compared to a similar period in 2019. Only 11% of these bookings were the result of Covid 19 cancellations so there is a huge surge of new interest. I guess the same will happen for hotels. The gist of it is below.https:/…Eddie
"Sorry but I find this hard to believe .Just because someone IE cruse ship companies puts this in a paper ,does not make it true .Edited: 12:05 pm, April 14, 2020 "
HiNo need to apologise. Just believe whatever you want to believe. Eddie
"Amazingly I have also heard that bookings are up for 2021 cruises, maybe the offers are too good for some die-hard cruisers to resist? I'm cautious of medical trials. The last time I tried a trial medication for HBP it was stopped after a year because it was causing sudden kidney failure. The time before a statin med trial ended after 8 months because the death rate from cardiac causes of those in it rose. For what it is worth, I just read in the Irish Times that an Oxford University research scientist says that they have developed a type of vaccine that they feel 80% certain will work and could be available by September. (our friends in Teramo luckily live in the country and are able to go out and work in their garden and also their grandmothers' local farms. But not being able to see family has made them lonely)Edited: 2:56 pm, April 14, 2020 "
"I have seen some big discounts for cruises, would that have any hearing on the reported upsurge in bookings?Let's hope that a vaccine is developed , tested, and found safe to use later this year.Until then, let's enjoy the enforced change of pace, no rushing hither and thither, no time to relax. The air is clearer, when we meet others out for their daily walk( all following the govt. guidelines ), people will stop to chat, at a safe distance of course. Make the best of it, go with the flow, and stay safe."
"The thing about having a great vaccine in 12 to 18 months is the mass won’t receive it by then. Front line workers first , then then everyone else.. I just recall years where it’s tough to find a flu vaccine, don’t get me started on shingles. Being able to manufacture this for billions of people will take time.Then being the guinea pig is scary....because we will all be that, really. Many people will just wait and see fir a year or two. Gosh, remember when that nsaid was pulled about 10 years ago?I think when everything is open and running, the criteria fir me will be the stats...how many new cases reported in the region I want to visit. Because think I cannot wait 3 years to travel waiting in a vaccine. Saying that, I’d Ike to have an antibody gets that is reliable to also make that decision.Edited: 8:50 am, April 15, 2020 "
Sorry for all the typos I’m not able to correct.
"Bear in mind that for international tourism to start up again, countries will need to reopen their borders, without imposing a 14-day quarantine, which won't work for tourists. I do not foresee this happening any time soon."
Sometime between 1995 and 2010 when we were living in Iowa there was a mass vaccination program for something. I remember getting our shots at a high school gym. That resulted in most of the state being inoculated in a week. I was just in touch with Truly Venice about our September 2020 apartment reservations. They are allowing reservations for the months to April 2021 to be changed without charge so we will be rescheduling ours for Sept 2021. Unfortunately the Fenice website does not have their opera schedule posted yet so it will be a guess as to best dates.
"As we struggle day to day in lockdown, holiday planning seems a bit out of scope.We all hope globally for a vaccine or treatment.Regarding cruises with Legionnaires Disease, norovirus, Covid-19, and cruise passengers stranded as countries deny disembarking, there is no discount, no bargain, no future credit, nor even a free paid cruise that would tempt.Vagabonda"
"I cannot imagine anyone wanting to put down money for a cruise at this point. The past few months showed the vulnerability and limits of cruise operation. Most importantly, nobody wants to risk being stranded and getting infected.Another risk is the cruise lines going bankrupt. They aren't receiving bailout money like some airlines. The only way they can raise capital is going through the stock market or bonds at this point. With negative cash flow though, who would want to invest?As to traveling this year, borders would have to become open again. Also, the initial people traveling are either ""must"" travelers or ones who are really brave. All countries worldwide will need at least several months to assess the impact of global passenger movement. I love to go places but I will not be in that first wave."
"sammy is right about the cruise lines being excluded from the COVID19 relief bills so far Mainly because they don't pay taxes in the US because they are foreign owned, do almost all their business activity outside of the US and employ only few US workers. They will benefit by the booking agencies being helped and eligible for loans. The WH is pushing to include them in any futures aid bill,"
"HiMore news about the Oxford University vaccine. Evidently, they are going to test the vaccine on people next week and hope to have a million doses ready by Sept with hundreds of millions of doses for use by the end of 2020. Obviously, nobody knows if it works or how long it will take to prove it works, or indeed, whether there will be side effects. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52329659Meanwhile, the finger-prick antibody tests evidently don't work on people under 40 because they don't produce enough antibodies to the virus. It's thought that their immune system uses something else to kill the virus. The UK government has ordered about 17 million of these home testing kits. I think the antibody kits are also going to be used all over the world. This test checks the blood for Coronavirus antibodies and if you've got them, you've had the disease and gained some immunity so you can hopefully go back to work. It's hoped that this test will help bring an end to the lock-down. The UK also ordered about 3.5 million kits from China and they don't work at all. The government is hoping to get the UK taxpayers money back. https:/…Eddie"
AlsoI booked a holiday about 8 months ago and only paid £100 deposit. I've only just paid the full amount. The holiday company is still hoping to start flights at the end of June. I live in hope but they assured me that I can postpone the holiday until it's safe to go or I can cancel it. I assume the same deal will be available on cruises. Eddie
I would have a big problem with cruise lines being bailed out. Carnival in particular really blew it in the early stages of Covid 19...money over safety and they continued to operate the ships until they reached a point whereby no port would take them. No excuses at all ....bad decisions.
"Eddie, I hope your holiday goes ahead,and that you enjoy it.I am still not holding my breath for a vaccine this year."
"There will be many deals when it's safer to travel.Most in Italy at the moment would be thrilled to just go beyond their own comune. I hope you and your family are safe and well Donna, and there was never any doubt of your good intentions.Recent studies indicate a lack of efficacy for hydroxychloroquine Covid-19 treatment, and side effects are significant.https://www.wsj.com/articles/french-drug-sur…https:/…index.htmlMany Covid patient recover without any drug interventions like hydroxychloroquine or remdesivir.We could all use a miracle!Vagabonda"

I had written that CC even prior to your posting as I was writing when you posted.Our Sicily forums are really very special.I have never been personal on these forums, but these aren't typical times. Some posting here are still anticipating near future (May and June) holidays. Really ground yourselves a bit, and take a look at this devastating pandemic. Perhaps you aren't feeling the impact where you live, and that's why. Stats and numbers of illness and deaths aren't real for you. Be grateful for that. But borders are closed to travel. Quarantines are in place. Tourism travel is not permitted.This isn't a time for pleasurable travel.Italians can't leave their own municipalities, not even to the next nearby comune.We must print and carry documents for grocery shopping.I am a realist Nora, and there won't be recovery for five.Two have passed. It was just this time yesterday when I received notice of the last admitted to hospital, and he won't recover at least with any quality of life.Imagine 45 days in Intensive Care for another, and now rehabilitation for how long?? And she isn't elderly!One seems to have managed to save himself, and ""may"" return home, but without his wife.Two are young and strong, and should be fine (eventually), but they have lost immediate family, and they were controlled by authorities, and were unable to visit in hospital, or attend funerals.No closure for them.Many in my family have been in lockdown since February. We contact each other daily for updates. It's hardest for those in cities, and those with young children.It's spring! Everyone wants to enjoy the beauty of the season, the flowers, and the sunshine.And especially after months confined.One cousin in a city has a balcony.

"Many in tourism (hotels and B&Bs, tour companies, cookery schools, transfer services, agriturismi, vineyards.....) are hoping that tourists will wait for cancellations, and give them a chance.Obviously there would never be a good time for a pandemic, but this really couldn't come at a worse time for tourism in a seasonal destination like Sicily.Wineries and olive oil agriturismi attempt to compensate a bit by selling and shipping their products, and hope for loyal support from past clientele.These hardworking, long-standing, and often family businesses are fighting for their lives and future existence.Their work has disappeared. There's no date for when work will return.Many have relaxed cancellation policies for services paid, and they have offered opportunities to reschedule without penalty.Many have humbly asked guests for support during these hard times.Many wonder if they will survive in such uncertain times.Many have worked so hard for year at a business.And even for generations. Many carry generational family hopes on their shoulders. Many worry about their loyal and hardworking staff and families.And even with such uncertainly, they are still committed. They are still working hard. They are still working the land, and still hoping to generate change for our fragile environment and the hope that Sicily can sustain work for our youth, and keep our youth here.Every practicality for a tourist says to cancel bookings. And economies are fragile everywhere.But every cancellation diminishes hope here.Every booking that isn't cancelled gives time for this situation to settle; time to give so many small businesses a chance to survive.You each know your circumstances. You each know your budget, and what you can and can't do.You need to first consider your families and your personal situation.But then if it's within your budget, please know that your support would always be appreciated.We hope you'll return when the time is right. And we hope that will be soon.And no one can predict what will happen come September.Really best wishes to everyone during these extremely challenging times.Take care of yourselves and your families, and stay positive.A positive attitude will make it easier to get through this, benefit your families, and maybe get a better night's sleep.Vagabonda"

People I know in person, with a known face other than a number on a report.I have both my son 21 and my daughter 17, plus my wife, with me safely at home and I selfishly hope to keep this horror out of my door.This is for me writing on TA. To cope with fear. Reporting what I see is a necessity to keep myself busy during these endless empty days.Keep strongRaffaele"
"I do not know what to say, Vagabonda... One family and so many losses... You are right: it is not the time to travel... the wounds should heal first and sadly so many wounds will never heal. Please accept my deepest and heartfelt condolences... I know my tears will not help but they are streaming... Hoping to return to my beloved Italy next year. I know many of us, Italy fans, will be back to stay in our favorite hotels and B&Bs, eat in the restaurants we love, enjoy divine coffee and wine, and it might help a bit to revitalize struggling businesses. Stay strong, my dearest! My heart is always with you and with Italy...Raffaele, so glad to hear that your family is doing fine! Nora"
"Vagabonda - so very, very sorry to hear what has happened to your family, so incredibly tragic. Our deepest condolences. - David & Laura"
"It's always so hard to hear about the losses so many people are experiencing with friends and family. It is so variable by location. It is also hard to hear how difficult life has become for so many people, especially those areas of the world where there is so much poverty. Our exchange daughter in Paraguay keeps texting e about how hard it is to even go out without being stopped by the police to prove you are doing something allowed and essential. The other day they were almost arrested because her niece in the car was not wearing a mask and should not have been out of the house for any reason other than going to a doctor. There was no plan to have her leave the car and as they were only going to drop food off to grandmom and let her wave from the car. She usually drives around dressed like she is doing one of her complicated dental procedures It is a poor country and their only hope is to stop any significant viral spread from starting. But that means people who earn a pittance by daywork are not able to leave the house to find the few pennies needed to buy food. But amazingly they are not complaining about the sacrifices they are making for their fellow Paraguayans. I'm sure there are other areas of the world in the same situation. So it drives me mad to hear people here complain of not being able to go to their hairdresser or barber like it is a major sacrifice."

"Oh, V.My heart hurts so badly for you, your family and your fellow countrymen/women. What an unspeakable tragedy. What unimaginable loss. What tremendous grief. I am so very very sorry for you. We have canceled two trips, one to Paris (we were supposed to be there this week) because we foresaw the coming storm, and the other to Greece in September because we just cannot imagine how travel could possibly be appropriate for the foreseeable future. Not amidst the pain and wreckage of this horrible plague. And here in the US, people are out in the streets, some toting guns, demanding their golf games and haircuts. Stay well and stay safe, Vagabonda. You inhabit a small piece of my heart...mmg"
"V.,Just a quick thank you for your thoughts on ways to support our favorite merchants... I emailed Mandranova and they are happy to ship! While it is expensive, we are glad to be able to support them in these dark times. Are you aware of which vineyards are shipping? I looked on Planeta's site but couldn't find anything. Maybe I'll email them. mmgEdited: 7:03 am, April 21, 2020 "
Have the US tariff rises affected the prices of mail order wine or olive oil?The prices of Locatello Romano and Parmesan cheeses are definitely higher in the stores here.
"Vagabonda:I just read your postings concerning your family situation. I have no words to express my shock and grief for you. Your postings are evidence of how precious life and good health is to everyone, and we all must be mindful of this and thankful to be healthy for as long as this lasts."
#156 Locatello Romano? A cheese? Never heard about it in Rome.
"From a food website: ""Locatelli cheese is imported from Sardinia and the Lazio Province (which includes Rome) in Italy. The brand originated in 1860 by dairy farmer Mattia Locatelli in Ballabio, Italy.As the #1 importer of Italian cheese to the US, Locatelli’s tariff costs (which also get passed on to the consumers) are hefty. According to the 2017 US Tariff Schedule (yes, I looked it up), the tax rate for imported sheep cheese is 9.6%. If a regular tub of Pecorino cost $6, it’s now $6.58 plus the combined state and county taxes as well.The price you pay for aged, imported, and high quality begs the question:Is Locatelli Worth It?Although expensive, Locatelli Pecorino Romano cheese is worth the extra dollars every few months.""Of course prices for Italian cheese would not directly rise because of the tariff itself, but the cost of a number of goods that come from China have risen in cost here because of the tariff but then similar American made goods had their prices increased by American makers to take advantage of the market rpice increases."
"So sorry, Vagabonda, about your losses. It's heartbreaking.Like many of you, I have been too disheartened to visit the forums for awhile. Though in good health, I am 70 and am beginning to fear I will never see Europe again. This year I had planned a land and sea package to Alaska. That's been cancelled, and I am taking a refund rather than credit because who knows if the cruise industry will ever recover.We replaced our usual fall Europe trip with a visit to Montreal and Quebec City. Now that's not looking too hopeful either.Just checking in to see how others are doing. In bocca al lupo, everyone."

Hi VagabondaI hope you read the forum. I tried to write to you a PM but looks like you don't receive them thus I am writing here.It's more than 3 days since you wrote your last post. Given you are a constant and reassuring presence on the forum and knowing about your situation I am wondering if you are all right
"HiDifferent country but Madeira is supposedly planning to open some hotels in July or even June. Don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger:-)https://www.madeiraislandnews.com/2020/04/ho…Eddie"
"Hi eddie/lynne hope you are safe, i hope things get back to some sort of normality soon, i am usually in italy in may, Ischia, naples. Missing my forum chats with the regulars, and asking/ giving advice. Take care Mitch."
"Hi MitchcornwallYes, we are both fine and well, thank you, and hope you are too. I can't wait to talk about the best restaurants and hotels in Ischia and the area again. Incidentally, I had three long holidays in St Ives and the area but it was many a long year ago. Eddie"
"Alot of my work is in St ives, plenty of rich people owning property, we live in Falmouth the only town in Cornwall thats a all year round place. I have been traveling to Italy for years now, and have a soft spot for Naples, Ischia, Procida, we love the area. Sorrento and capri last year were nice, but has changed , and is expensive, but we still find it lovely."
Very sorry to hear this Vagabonda. My deepest condolences to you and and your family in this very difficult time.
"Dear Vagabonda,A quick message to say sincere condolences for your losses... may the others get better quickly, and the rest of you stay safe and well. Best wishes from Paris,Andrew"
"Dearest Vagabonda,I’ve been too saddened about Italy to check into Tripadvisor Italy forum recently. I just read that you have had seven family members afflicted. Two fatally-what heartbreak. I wish that I could hug you, take you for drinks so you could decompress. I’m sending hope and best wishes to you and your family. You’ve helped all of your TA family so much in innumerable ways. I am so so deeply sorry for your loss and your pain."
"Chester9cat, you have put it beautifully. We so appreciate Vagabonda, holding her in “soft air,” as you so beautifully put it, altogether as a little community. We sadly, deeply, genuinely, hope that she and her family and loved ones have faith and hope and that their grief is not devastatingly long-lived. Despite not having met Vagabonda in person, I am crying, feeling Vagabonda’s pain. Stay safe, keep yourself and others protected, stay home when possible, wear masks, my fellow travelers. I know as soon as most of us here can, we will return to our beloved Italy in a safe manner for us and for Italians, and help them in every way possible. Again, V, I am so deeply sorry for your losses.Edited: 12:21 am, April 27, 2020 "

"VagabondaI am so, so dreadfully sorry for the way this virus hit you hard. I only have one family member, my elderly mother, who has tested Covid19 positive, and I am gutted. I am unable to be with her, and can only pray from afar. 30 residents in her care home have died, I knew many of them....but unlike you, they were not my family.I cannot imagine what you are suffering. I ache for you."
