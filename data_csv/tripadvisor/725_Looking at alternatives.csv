"Due to Covid-19 we still hope that our summer trip will go ahead as planned, maybe I am just in denial.Anyway just to hedge our bets I have managed to secure some reward flights flying into Seattle and out of Las Vegas which will give us 25 days for a road trip, have still to book a car but will be looking to book a Ford Edge size suv . Ideas at the present are; Come down the coast to Sacramento then Yosemite NP Death Valley NPLas Vegas. orHead for Yellowstone or GTNP and then Salt Lake City to VegasWhat we like is great scenery , soft hikes (max 5hrs) we try to spend as much time as we can away from the interstates (although will jump back on them if necessary) we wish to spend the last 5 days in LV for a little recuperation a little time in the casinos and maybe catch a show .any ideas will be greatly appreciated"
"Hi.In just under 4 weeks both of those are possible, although the inland route you may run out of days compress to options. You may have to reduce the 5 Vegas days?Other option would be all West Coast, including Hwy 1 with step inland for Yosemite and then DV to Vegas. Some inland stuff on the way down too.But......when is this? You say Summer but when?Edited: 9:25 am, April 26, 2020 "
"That should read ‘compared to options’ and Yellowstone and GTNP are really bookends, that compliment each other."
"Getting lodging in Yellowstone area could be problematic. I'm just vaguely familiar with the current issues with booking lodging there for this summer. You should post on the Wyoming forum for specific help.Between Yellowstone and Las Vegas are the possibility of six national parks to visit - Grand Teton (immediately south of Yellowstone), Arches, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Bryce and Zion in Utah. You could easily use 10 days visiting those parks. Yellowstone should have a minimum of 4 nights. That would leave you 11 nights to work with including the time in Las Vegas. You wouldn't have to visit all of those parks. But you would basically be driving right by Grand Teton, Bryce and Zion on the way to Las Vegas from Yellowstone. You need a minimum of 4 nights for those parks, plus an overnight in SLC to break up the long drive from Grand Teton to Las Vegas. Personally, I think you need to skip trying to get to Yellowstone.Five days in hot, hot, Las Vegas is a lot of time. However, you'll have lots of opportunities to leave cash in Las Vegas.When this summer is important to know. It's very possible that lodging at the national parks, hotels in general and the casinos in Las Vegas may not even be open until mid June or later."
"Looking at posting history, I think the Plan A trip is to Hawaii, late July into August?I’m not so sure ( but of course Hawaii has limited resources and a problem now with mainlanders heading there and not doing quarantine!) that a trip to the US mainland will be anymore likely to be viable in timescale?"
"Right now anything that is said is a guess. The parks are still closed, and probably will remain so, as are most ""non-essential"" businesses and food service is take-out only.We anticipate a loosening of the lockdown after May 1. Where that goes is anyone's guess - like most countries we are guessing what to do when. Fear of a resurgence of the disease when the lockdown ends is driving most government planning right now - what to do if it starts up again. That will all depend upon how diligent people are at continuing the protective protocols in place now.Suggest you delay the trip as long as is possible - the farther out you put it, the higher the probability of being able to do it at all this year. And then there's the 60 days ban on ""immigration"" that you may run into.Stay well."
"I did note the following uttered by POTUS in one of his briefings the other week, when you could disaggregate it from the BS, grandstanding, sycophancy, and comedy moments.‘As we begin a science-based reopening, we must be extra vigilant in blocking the foreign entry of the virus from abroad. Border control, travel restrictions, and other limitations on entry are more important than ever to keep the virus in check and allow Americans to get back to work.’So I’m guessing lifting restrictions on foreign travel will be on the back burner given the domestic and political pressures? Unfortunately, looks like the nightly entertainment is off for a while after the ‘disinfectant’ debacle however?Edited: 12:29 pm, April 27, 2020 "
"@ValiantYes your correct we still have flights booked for Hawaii but we have also managed to book reward flights with BA for Seattle & LV so worst case if we have to cancel flights we will only lose £35 eachWe may be over optimistic in still planning for a holiday in late July into August , but this seems to be a fast moving situation and anything seems possible.After further consideration it maybe better to forget YNP & GTNP So the current thinking is; Seattle , ONP, Portland, Hood River,Salt Lake City, then depending on time Capital Reef, Bryce & Zion although we have done parts of this route before there is no harm in a revisit .The alternative is down the coast, Portland , Salem, Redding, Reno, DV, LV.We appreciate that all of this maybe wishful thinking and we may not even be able to fly anywhere and if we are able to fly that nowhere will be open, on the other hand things change quickly and business adapt like we all will need to ."
What did I miss ??
@ValiantCareful there is disinfectant to cure that problem :))
"Hi,You could consider Olympic NP, Mt Rainier, Crater Lake, Redwood, Lake Tahe, and SEKI."
"When are your flights? If it's for later in the summer high heat can be an issue in some of the red-rock national parks, and some places like Yosemite are not at their best past August, as the famous waterfalls start to dry up. One thing you might consider as a ""thought experiment"" would be to make your road trip a loop, thereby avoiding high one-way car hire fees, then just fly to Las Vegas for your end-of-trip experience. One-way flights in, say, August from Seattle to Las Vegas are around US$60, and could easily save several time that in car costs. You could even do a couple of weeks in the Pacific Northwest, then a week with a second loop out of Las Vegas - maybe to Zion, Bryce or the Grand Canyon. Just a thought, anyway.For a Seattle - Seattle loop (and assuming cross-border leisure travel is allowed) you might look at a loop something like this - https://goo.gl/maps/cfxinE874db4htVz9 - which would include the Kootenays, Banff, Jasper and Whistler in British Columbia, with a return to Seattle, or this - https://goo.gl/maps/wB2NzcpM5udbtr4JA - which would include Olympic National Park, the Columbia River Gorge, Mount Hood, and some very scenic ""old west"" scenery in places like north-central Oregon (Smith Rock) and the stunning, little-publicized Wallowa Mountains in northeastern Oregon. Google these places. You could also include Lake Chelan in eastern Washington, including a ride on the ""Lady of the Lake"" ferry up the fjord-like lake to the isolated hamlet of Stehekin. Just some thoughts, anyway. IF the trip is even possible, of course."
"ibgardyloo....both of these routes are great ideas did not cross my mind to do a round route from SEA and then fly to LV.Just had a quick look car hire would be a saving of approx $2K and plenty of availability for a reward flight to either LV, LAX or PHX So all in all you have given us plenty to think about , although we are hoping that the trip to Hawaii will still go ahead as planned As I have said earlier this may all just be wishful thinking but old army habits plan for the worst hope for the best again thank you"
"‘Just had a quick look car hire would be a saving of approx $2K ‘That’s a big difference!, but giving the cost in $ makes me suspicious of where your looking at rental?Edited: 1:59 pm, April 27, 2020 "
"And on a quick search I can find all in rentals for that one way, including the one way fee which cost less than the equivalent of $2000 in total, in £s of course.Edited: 2:08 pm, April 27, 2020 "
"Vallliant quick search for STD SUV SEA-LASFor one way rental 24 Longstaff Crescent days looked at Avis £2165 , Alamo £2066, Budget £4050Enterprise £2318 ,Dollar $3265, Sixt £2135 these are all pay on arrivalSEA-SEA 17 days rentalSixt £869, Avis £1583 ,Budget £1137 etc etc through BA Budget Ford Explorer £526LAS 7 day car hire £270Who were you looking at for cheaper prices ?Edited: 5:09 pm, April 27, 2020 "
It’s hard to do any checking with our exact dates.I’m unsure what you want to do on this trip.You can also do other round trips and on ways
"I didn’t put a lot of effort in, I just looked at AutoEurope, for random 3 weeks July/Aug, came out at £1560 for a Standard SUV with Alamo.I made no effort to try direct booking with CDPs or wizard numbers etc, or even other brokers, like the German one who often has unusual drop fee free one ways."
"@ VallantSorry if that came across as rude it was not meant to @Danp we are not sure either ! Until we know what is happening with flights etc this is just looking at various permutations. We have to make a decision by 27th May after that date accommodation we have booked in Hawaii is non-refundable which would be a considerable financial loss. As all flights the islands are reward bookings if I need to cancel flights I only stand to lose £27, the inter island flight is another matter. Hopefully things will become clearer in the not to distant futureIn the mean time a big thank you to everyoneEdited: 6:54 am, April 28, 2020 "
"‘Sorry if that came across as rude it was not meant to’No, No problem, I didn’t take it that way at all.Edited: 7:25 am, April 28, 2020 "
"I love your proposed route.West CoastIf at all possible, schedule some extra time to take highway 1 instead of 101. You'll cover half the distance in a day, but the scenery is well worth it. NevadaAside from the obvious suggestions like tours of Hoover Dam & the Grand Canyon, I recommend heading a few hours NorthEast of Vegas to check out Zion & Needles National Parks. (I like Zion more than both Yosemite and Grand Canyon.)Crossing fingers travel restrictions will be lifted by then!"
Well just received confirmation that BA have cancelled flights to Hawaii.So back up plan will now be put into actionArrive 31/07 into Seattle and Depart Vegas 28/08 which gives us 28 days So plan is to spend 20 days in the Pacific NW then 1 day travel (flying) to Vegas and then the final week there Still working on the Seattle loop but love the suggestions put forward by ibgardyloo will now spend more time researching the options.Vegas will include side trips to Canyon of Fire and Zion
"We did an awesome two week trip with ibgardyloo ideas a couple of summers ago.Here is what we did- flew in and out of SeattleTour of cityWhidbey island by ferryMt. Rainier NPSouthern coast of Oregon with stops along the way at Heceta Head lighthouse, Bandon, etc.Redwoods NP near Crescent City, Ca and Jedidiah Smith SP walking Stout Grove was amazingGrants PassCrater Lake NPBendMt. HoodColumbia River Gorge and Hood RiverColumbia River Gorge to PortlandTour on our own of Portland for a couple of daysMt. St. HelensBack to Seattle to fly homeWe did not do Olympic NP because really takes 3 full days with different lodging and just could not get it to work on that trip with ferry schedule, logistics, etc so it is on bucket list."
"Valley of Fire will be fine as a day trip, but well, on fire, for temps. Zion needs more than a day trip from Las Vegas."
"The weekend you plan to get into Seattle would have been a problem but the event was cancelled. The first weekend is an annual boat racing and air show over lake Washington. This brings in tons of visitors.Day 1 to SeattleDay 2 SeattleDay 3-5 OlympicDay 4-6 Oregon coastDay 7 redwoodsDay 8 to grants pass or crater lakeDay 9 to crater lake to bendDay 10 to hood riverDay 11 to Portland Dsy 12 Portland Day 13 to my rainierDay 14 my rainierDay 15 to YakimaDay 16 to chelanDay 17 to north cascades to anacortesDay 18-19 San Juan islandsDay 20 back to Seattle snd evrning or early am flight to VegasYiu coukd drop redwoods, crater lake, bend, Yakima, chrlan and spent about 6 dats or so in Victoria, Vancouver and other parts of BC"
PeachBelle that sounds a fantastic trip there are so many great places to see so little time will start trying to pin some route down and pencil in hotel stops (as long as I can just hold against CC ) as who know if travel will still be allowed thbergs agree Zion needs more than a fleeting visit depends on what accommodation we can find available if we have to rule out Zion we can always go to Bryce am also looking at Red Rock Canyon as a day trip with some soft hiking
"Are you intending to stay in Vegas for the whole of your last week, or have a few nights out of the city book ended by Vegas time? For my money, Grand Canyon, Zion and Bryce Canyon are more rewarding than VofF or Red Rock Canyon, but are going to need nights out of the city. They, also, will be slightly less hot options because there is shade in the main Zion canyon and Bryce and GC are higher.If you are wanting your evenings in Vegas for shows, dining or whatever, then Red Rock canyon, VofF, Lake Mead or even Death Valley (yes, possibly hotter still!) are the better self driving day trips.ibgardyloo's or PB's variant will be excellent ideas for the PNW area.SWT"
"SWTJust looking at options for nights away and day trips we were at GC 2 yrs ago but has been a few years since we went to Zion or Bryce . At the moment we had sort of allowed 8 nights for the Vegas end of the trip we could cut the PNW and add to LV if we really need to.At the moment it s a case of pencil in various permutations as so much is dependant on what is open. LV hotels are aiming to open any day now but then it depends on all the social distance rules that may be in place .At the moment although we have flights will they actually happen and so on .Edited: 1:05 pm, June 03, 2020 "
"Visiting Zion as a day trip from Las Vegas could prove to be an exercise in frustration and disappointment. Currently, the shuttle buses are not operating to access the main Zion canyon. Visitors are allowed to drive vehicles in to the canyon. However, parking in the canyon is extremely limited. When the parking areas are fulled, access to the canyon by vehicle is closed. There have been reports of all the parking being full at 8 AM. With no parking available, visitors have been walking in or biking.There are rumors that the shuttle buses may be operating by the end of June. If that's the case, social distancing will need to be in place. The historically long queues to get on a shuttle bus will be even longer because there will be fewer riders for each bus. So lots and lots of time of standing around at the visitor center to get on a bus and then more standing around within the canyon to get on a bus. Honestly, I would avoid Zion this summer.Except for the visitor center and some lodging, Bryce is fully accessible. But Bryce and Red Canyon are not a day trip from Las Vegas by any stretch of the imagination. It's a 4.5 hour drive, one way."
