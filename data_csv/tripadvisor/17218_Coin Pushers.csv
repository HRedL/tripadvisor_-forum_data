"Headed to Vegas in a month and a half. My wife a absolutely loves those coin pushers. With that being said, I was curious if anyone knows of any at any of the casinos on the strip or downtown?Thabks in advance!"
Circus circus. Not sure if you only win tickets though!
"None in casinos, just arcades."
Those are a thing of the past in the casinos. They used to be everywhere until the mid 90’s. Not sure why they disappeared. You would think they’d still have a few around to lighten your pockets of any spare change you might have.
"There may be one in the game area at Excalibur,but not sure. good luck"
They are called Bonus Hole here in Wisconsin and can be found at most country bars. ;)
"Think I saw one at Dave & Buster’s, but it’s out in Summerlin.Good luck,Hunt"
"I’ve never seen one in a casino, but Hunt might be on to something as I know the local D & B’s have them. 13"
For a long time they were in every casino but I don't remember seeing them nearly as often as in the past.
"I used to love these games. The only place you can play them are arcades now. I have not seen any in casinos. Surprisingly, when I took a cruise they had these. The casino manager would add $10 and $20 bills to the coins in the morning to get people to play."
"Could someone please clue me in. What is a ""Coin Pusher""? Is that the same cart-like thing that the change people used to push around when the machines took coins? If that's the case, you can get change, but not coins."
NCL cruise ships have them in their casinos.
"#10,This shows one in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E1N37G9Zu0Hope that helps,Hunt"
"One year, a bunch of us were at the golden gate and we played their pusher and one of the slides was a bit broken and went over the coins. Anyways we played for fun for a while. It would be a bunch of talk between us and then once the coin fell and didn't win or was on the broken shelf, we would all laugh. Repeat.Next day, we're at the Strat, and a group of Japanese people were playing the same game. It was a carbon copy of our experience except the talk was in Japanese, but the laughter was the same. We got a kick out of it."
"I played one 2 yrs ago in Treasure Island...had a blast for a good hour and actually managed to come out on top. But that was 2 years ago...not sure it's still there.Edited: 1:32 pm, March 09, 2020 "

"The last time I saw one was at Slots a fun But I doubt there are any ""casino"" coin pushers left. Casino coin pushers were for actual money or basically a slot machine. Only in video arcades for ""fun"".Edited: 8:01 am, July 20, 2020 "
My wife played one on a Celebrity Cruise ship. At one point the ship seemed to suddenly lean at little more than usual causing some coins in the back to shift and the pusher then shoved $125 into the tray for her.They are fun to watch but usually just tease you.
"#18That means that coin pushers are a beatable game, at least on a cruise ship, when there are rough seas.I haven't seen the casino version with real quarters in many years."
I think they have banned these machines in an attempt to get more of these coins back into circulation to solve the coin shortage epidemic.
