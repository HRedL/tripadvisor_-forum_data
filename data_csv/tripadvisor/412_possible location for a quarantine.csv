"with all the hype I'll ver the virus. i began to ponder where would someone be, or many people be placed in quarantine while in Jamaica? how would it be paid for? anyone have any info on such a scenario? just wondering.."
"<< “anyone have any info on such a scenario?“ >>Anyone... here... on TripAdvisor?Yeah, sure.:-)"
"why even reply if you have nothing to say???Edited: 7:45 am, March 03, 2020 "
"Why don’t your contact the MOH and ask them.. what makes you think anyone in TripAdvisor (mainly TOURISTS) would have a clue about something like this??If you’re on a resort and you fall ill, you’d be kept in your room. There’s no need for hospital care unless you’re elderly and/or have other underlying health issues. By the time you’d fall I’ll you would’ve already passed the virus to hundreds of people. Can’t get into the panic of this virus.. we’re more concerned about Dengue than Corona down here"
"At one point 100 people were in isolation or quarantine facilities in Jamaica. None of these were tourists, most came from China or had been exposed to someone who traveled from China. The govt has a hospital in Western Jamaica that will be used and and it appears St Josephs hospital in Kingston is being used."
I can't even believe a tourist is asking about this lol. Sounds like someone needs to turn off the TV...That said - as mentioned before you'd probably self-quarantine in your hotel or resort room. And once you were deemed fit to travel the Jamaican government will haul your a$$ right out of the country.Who pays for it? Why you do! Who else would?

"""The all knowing hath spake. Bow, ye lowly tourists and despair!""I'm sorry - how in the world is my post ""all knowing""???? I simply repeated what someone else posted (quarantine to a resort) and stated the obvious (you get to pay all expenses related to your quarantine).And are you going to tell me that the question put forth was serious?Edited: 2:30 pm, March 03, 2020 "
as clarity. for asking a question. i am not a hyperbole person freaking out. quite the contrary. i posted a question that i thought some one might have some insight to. if the question was beyond your acceptance then forgive me. perhaps i should post say. whats the weather going to be. so you all could post your professional response to. seems that your all a bit up tight. relax lets things be.
"I'm not an expert in anything to do with the virus, but if someone on a plane or staying at a hotel or resort is diagnosed with Corvid-19 is everyone that was sitting near that person on the plane or EVERYONE that is staying at the resort to go into quarantine? Isn't that what they did to the Diamond Princess cruise ship?That would be my concern, one person is all it may take."
"<< ""I'm not an expert in anything to do with the virus, but ..."" >>And neither is anyone else here.I'm just saying...:-)"
"Which is why the OP need to contact the MoH for answers.. this is not the place. Trust me when I say that the MoH is going to do what they can to protect their citizens ( and they should) so if tourists get the corona virus, they’ll will stay put in their resort or hotel unless medically necessary and will be asked (told) to leave the island as soon as they are able. I also believe you will find some medical personnel who will refuse to treat tourists with Corona for fear of contamination.... sad, but true. Jamaicans are funny like that. And no, you will not get a discount or a free flight home."
"Many months later..I just read info from the UK that stated ja will begin re opening, and visitors WILL spend 14 days in quarintine. I came to ask the same question (where might that be) but now I'm skeered..."
"Currently JA are allowing repatriated people to land- from cruise ships, other countries etc. The majority of them are being taken to specially set-up quarantine areas. There are a couple of hospitals, and a few resorts - namely Grand Bahia and Jewel Paradise Cove in Runaway Bay, which are being used. Once they have been tested, they can then go home on a 14 day isolation. When they decide to open the borders for non-Jamaican's, I'm guessing (I'm not an expert before some wise guy comments), in my opinion, that this will be done similar to other countries, where they will decide who can start to visit. There has been talks of having a 'health passport' etc, but so many things still to consider."
Thanks!
"kw d: not sure where you’re getting your info, but nothing official has been announced by our PM. The borders are set to open tomorrow (American and Delta have already announced their flights) and the PM will be making an announcement today about tourism. Testing before boarding is the way to go.. not a 5 day old note from your doctor. We can’t expect people to come here and quarantine in their hotel rooms.. why bother coming?? That’s one reason England is off my list.. that and I don’t think they’ve done a good enough job dealing with the virus"
"@ Iriestar - is there an instant test result now then?? When I last checked (again, I'm not an expert), test results take 48-72 hours for a COVID positive/negative test. There is an instant (20 minutes) test for antibodies, but this is not the same test. If it takes over 2 days to get the result, how can this be done pre-boarding?"
"I don’t know. There are rapid tests... don’t know how effective they are, but something has to be done. Temp check at the airport, before boarding and when you land is a good idea... won’t catch all people sick but might catch a few. They are now saying it could be October before the borders are open for tourists. That can happen. Our economy will crumble."
"Yeah, I just read an article released today, although it was The Gleaner!!"
Emirates Airlines has been doing rapid covid-19 testing before allowing passengers to board. https:/…
"""I just read info from the UK that stated ja will begin re opening, and visitors WILL spend 14 days in quarintine.""I think you may have misunderstood - returning Jamaicans are under orders to quarantine for 14 days. Flights OUT of Jamaica that were scheduled for the first week of June have now been rescheduled for mid-June. I can't see tourists being required to quarantine for 14 days - as that is the max vacation tourists usually take I can't see them booking only to be quarantined in their room for their entire stay."
