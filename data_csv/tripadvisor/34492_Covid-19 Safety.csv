"I listened to the Governor. In announcing initial opening for business, he talked about the plight everywhere of business owners and employees who are out of work and that he “didn’t give a d- -n about politics right now”, which I agree with.But he didn’t talk about other things that are on my mind: like there is no 14-day decline in COVID-19 cases like the Guidelines say, and he said cases will go up after re-opening, and with now and extra cases up to half of times you can catch it from somebody who has no symptoms which he talked about before, and so where testing and follow-up stand in Georgia matters. I listened to what the Governor said. I’m just a tourist, but I’m not sure he was thinking about me, or trying to persuade me and my family to come. I have a simple question: with reopening now, I would like to know if we would be safe.Edited: 12:07 pm, April 21, 2020 "
"""I have a simple question: with reopening now, I would like to know if we would be safe.""No."
Listen to what the Mayor of Atlanta Keisha Lance Bottoms has to say. She says for everyone to stay home. She is not in favor of the governor's order and was not even included in the discussion. All the mayor's of Georgia's larger cities agree with her.
People in other US States will be watching for sure! I hope all goes well and that there is no virus spike.

"RE: QuestionWhen I read what was going on, I didn’t know what to make of it, so I asked. Then I read Post 2—that the Governor didn’t talk to the Mayor of Atlanta about business or making people feel safe coming to Atlanta (or Georgia) before doing what he is doing. That struck me as rude, and I didn’t understand it. So I looked some more, and found right on their Convention site that Atlanta has had more than 1 million people coming every week, on the average, along with $15 billion, 740 meetings and 17 city-wide conventions each year. I still don’t understand--but I don’t have to. It’s not the words, it's confidence. People are trying, while the Governor is making me and maybe others uneasy. I don’t want to get sick no matter what….and other places everywhere are itching to help out.Edited: 7:21 pm, April 21, 2020 "
"You asked a question. It was answered.NO ONE thinks the governor's announcement is a good thing. People on his own task force didn't know about it until his announcement.Just because he stood up there and said what he said yesterday doesn't mean that it's ""safe"" or that Georgia is ""open"".We haven't met the WH guidelines = 14 day drop. Many think it's a way to avoid paying unemployment benefits to people out of work.Come if you want to. We've answered your question."
"The Governor had spoken.Thank you for the clarification.Edited: 8:01 pm, April 21, 2020 "
"""Atlanta has had more than 1 million people coming every week, on the average, along with $15 billion, 740 meetings and 17 city-wide conventions each year.""Yeah, but almost everything has been cancelled already for several months to come."
"I wonder how you get a haircut, tattoo, mani/pedi while observing safe covid -19 physical distancing."
"Re: post 8The thought was: the opportunities are huge and the losses can be recouped. But confidence in a safe Atlanta is needed, not reopening and state policy that calls safety into question.What gave me pause was not the details, but that they came from the highest authority in Georgia.The Governor gave his word he did so without “giving a d—m about politics”. It was then a matter of principle, and I wondered where my family and I fit into the program.Edited: 11:09 pm, April 21, 2020 "
"Georgia has been in the top 10 states and has not had a drop over 14 days.The governor's coronavirus task force didn't even know he was going to make the announcement.He's not following White House guidelines (14 days of dropping). We don't have a testing system set up (yet). It doesn't make sense.If you want to come to one of the most affected states in the US, come on down!https://tinyurl.com/sx9w8tkEdited: 11:23 pm, April 21, 2020 "

"""I wonder how you get a haircut,""Have whoever you live with do it. My wife just did mine today and it was fine. :))"
"I took a look at a City map, and I discovered: The Governor, high State authority, is on Washington Street.The CDC, high science authority, is on Clifton Road.And I wondered: is this a show-down, on safety, of political authority versus medical authority, played out before the Atlanta tourists and the Atlanta group business and the Atlanta residents, with an after-taste, and a beacon for elsewhere? On reopening and safety, I wondered if the Governor was listening to what was going on down the street, or to a different drum, and to the reaction of the rest of the audience.I told my family I’ve stopped planning.I’m waiting. We’re waiting.Edited: 10:31 am, April 22, 2020 "
"Atlanta?! Have you not followed what's happening on the national stage? Noticed the absence of CDC spokespersons during this global pandemic?!Interesting piece in the Washington Post today =""Georgia leads the race to become America’s No. 1 Death Destination"""
"I'm guessing this thread is more for venting frustration against Georgia than for tourism. Most of us in Georgia think this is crazy so you don't have to convince us. But as OMR pointed out, there is plenty of crazy to go around throughout the country right now. One point to address: ""Atlanta has had more than 1 million people coming every week, on the average, along with $15 billion, 740 meetings and 17 city-wide conventions each year."" My brother works in the convention industry here in Atlanta. His company provided him the paperwork to file for unemployment early on so they can help their employees get through this. The industry understands what's going on and is braced for a long-term impact. I believe that the governor's actions are not motivated by the impact on the industry."
One thought about the convention industry - it's impacted nationwide. Georgia opening early is NOT going to help conventions in any way. People can't travel. Conventions are planned months in advance. Most industry conventions have just cancelled their 2020 convention and plan to have their 2021 - if possible. No one knows if 2021 conventions will be possible in ANY city in the country. It may be a very long while before thousands can gather together at sports events or conventions.So opening Georgia now impacts conventions in Georgia 0%.
the governor is completely playing politics.
And now even Trump is saying Georgia opened too early. I never thought I'd see the day where I agreed with that ... person.
"Not the Onion =""Among the businesses that Kemp...., plans to allow to reopen on Friday are hair and nail salons and tattoo parlors.“I believe people in Atlanta would understand that if their cases are not going down that they need to continue to do everything that we said — social distancing, washing your hands, wearing a mask in public — so if there’s a way that people can social distance and do those things, then they can do those things. I don’t know how, but people are very creative,” Birx said""Edited: 7:43 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"In Post 18, PALsIMHO suggests the Governor is “completely playing politics” although, in fairness, the Governor gave his word he is not.However, if things are as PaLsIMHO suggests, and if the Governor has not provided a system of aggressive testing, rigorous transparent data, contact tracing, isolation and follow-up as the IHME Model assumes before re-opening, will Atlanta and Georgia make a persuasive case for COVID-19 safety to:1. visitors concerned for their families; and 2. Boards of Directors with fiduciary duty in making competitive choices for future city-wise and other meeting locations?Edited: 8:06 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"Who knows.Seriously, what's your agenda here?"
"""Seriously, what's your agenda here?""I agree.You started with - ""I have a simple question: with reopening now, I would like to know if we would be safe.""The answer was provided almost immediately = ""No"".This is a travel forum, not a politics forum.If the information the locals have shared with you has not been helpful in making your decision to travel to Georgia now - or not - I can't imagine what else can be said.Edited: 9:01 pm, April 22, 2020 "
"To the OP, something that I would think shouldn’t ever have to be stated is that any time a politician ever says “I don’t give a damn about politics”, rest assured that politician very much gives a damn about politics.But as much as I’d love there to be something to read here on TA (especially since I’m hanging out on it far more than usual these days), I’d rather it be something ostensibly to do with travel. I certainly wouldn’t want it to become a referendum on Georgia’s governor’s decision (not to be confused with “Georgia’s decision”) to go full Lebowski. As opinionated as I may be on the topic and the underlying motives behind it, this is a travel forum & descending into the world of pure politics (as evidenced by some of the other TA forums I’ve read) runs the risk of at worst devolving these travel forums into the equivalent of community Facebook groups - like, hasn’t Coronavirus already caused enough harm without doing THAT to us? And I don’t think this can be spun into a travel question. Suffice it to say, as wonderful as a made-in-Georgia tattoo can only be, I don’t think you’re going to get any advice from us that it’s worth bucking CDC guidelines to head on down. And prolonging the conversation in the hopes of stirring up a talking-head panel is not really what TA is about."
I agree.Maybe go to the new Lounge created by TA when travel questions started dropping off due to Covid 19. Maybe they have political posts there. I don't know. I've not been there since the first days.Nothing really new to say on this topic - that is travel related anyway.
"This is kind of flippant, but apparently the Governor stopped watching Super Bowl LI after the 3rd quarter."
Stay in Maryland. Gov. Hogan knows what he is doing and follows the guidance of medical experts. Gov. Kemp clearly does not.
"Stay wherever you are. Now is not the time to be traveling to any state, unless you are a nurse and you are traveling to help in overwhelmed cities.How are people finding there way here? Just coming to the Georgia forum to tell people that the GA Governor made a stupid decision? Gee...thanks. We appreciate that SO much.Unbelievable."
#28:The OP makes the rounds (see minimally New York and Florida forums). IMO he/she has no intention of coming to Georgia as a tourist.
I agree. I clicked on the name to see what kind of recent information was shared. I guess everyone has to spend their spare time SOME way.

"Look, our governor is an idiot. This reopening thing has nothing to do with safety - it's a political move to avoid paying out unemployment.

"JimG, I'm SO glad you are back!Fabulous answer!Of course, I think my answer in #1 was pretty clear on the 21st, but maybe yours will be the one that will shut this looney looping down. Hope so anyway."
I would wait until at least May 15th or June 1st before I would open up anything.
"""I would wait until at least May 15th or June 1st'That's basically what the Governor is doing, at least when it comes to his personal exposure. He wants all these people to go back to work, and yet the Governor's Mansion remains closed to tours and outside groups. What does that tell you?If he won't open his state-owned and taxpayer-funded residence, then why should anyone else be willing to do the same with their businesses?-JimG"
"I agree, JimG.One suggestion about ""safety"" = when the hospitals allow visitors."
