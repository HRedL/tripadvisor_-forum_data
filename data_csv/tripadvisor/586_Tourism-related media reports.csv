Continued Orange through July 5 I see...
Yes. The color for the following week (Monday through Sunday) is announced every Thursday at 8pm.

"""Cancun, Riviera Maya tourism progressing positively""https:/…2020.htmlI am a little surprised that very few people in the photo at the airport are not masked up. Just figured everyone would be masked. Wearing one below your chin doesn't count.BP"
"I'd say that's not a recent photo, Brent -- possibly taken a few months ago.I've seen more recent airport photos showing airline staff wearing masks. And marks on the floor to maintain physical distancing is a requirement here now -- I don't see that in the photo.Edited: 4:12 pm, June 29, 2020 "
