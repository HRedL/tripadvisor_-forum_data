From the Motley Fool. Written by someone who lives in Las Vegas. Makes some good points.https:/…why-re-open-the-las-vegas-strip.aspx
"I read that article earlier today. Well written. I agree to open the ""locals"" casinos first, followed by the Strip resorts and casinos, opening later. Baby steps, with separation, one day at a time. Very good article and thanks for posting."
"Interesting read and actually makes a lot of sense. The analogy comparing the strip to a cruise ship is correct when you think about it. thanks for posting.Edited: 4:59 am, April 10, 2020 "
"I think it's going to work itself out. The lack of visitors is going to ""titrate"" the openings. I could see a company like Caesars opening up two hotels and maybe three casinos to start. I imagine MGM would do the same. There just isn't going to be capacity to justify any more.The real killer will be the lack of business travelers. It's going to be a long time before we see big meetings and conventions for two reasons: First, the general concern about large gatherings. But second, and this one is kind of unexpected. So many businesses have had to dramatically redesign how they do business during this crisis, that the trend towards virtual is unstoppable. The time and expense of arranging travel for a in person meeting is going to be harder to justify."
Thanks for the link...enjoyed reading the article
"Well worded article,Edited: 9:18 am, April 10, 2020 "
"MGM and Ceasars should open up one casino each from their Strip properties. Wynn or Encore. The Strat, Sahara, maybe Casino Royale. Boyd should open Main Street Station or the Cal downtown, and Sams Town (not Eastside Cannery) on Boulder Highway. Leave the Fremont closed for now. Stevens should open the D or, less likely, Golden Gate. The group that owns 4 Queens and Binions should open the latter. El Cortez and Downtown Grand are far enough apart from these suggestions Downtown they can open. Do this for a couple of months, and then open the other places if no new outbreaks occur. Summer isn't necessarily the busiest time in Vegas anyway, though I realize that's relative.This would get some people back to work, while giving people with the Vegas itch something tangible to take advantage of. I still don't think the Nevada governor will let any casino open until at least June; even if virtually every area in the United States has had their peak come and gone, many will still be on the downward curve. That is not the same thing as saying that the country is in the free and clear."
What I think is funny and sad at the same time is that there are deniers who think all the casinos should be open now. I agree this is a well written article and he makes some very good points. Think it will be a long time if ever it gets back to normal. Conventions which is one of the backbones of the Strip will be in short supply for a very long time.
"Some interesting concepts to contemplate, indeed.Thank you for the link,Hunt"
Conventions might be a thing of the past. Look how fast everyone realized how technology can be used to continue business.
"I also liked this article. And agree, widespread testing is needed. I'm waiting on an antibody test myself, to see if I have immunity from my mystery December illness."
"I was told anyone who wanted a test , can get a test..and the tests are beautiful ...I guess that was a falsehood...actually I know it was, as my daughter, an RN, couldn’t get a test less then 2 weeks ago...But agree 100% with 2 salty..."
"I think the LV could and should be ok in the short term, if the Feds can eliminate travel to and from other countries until a vaccine is established. I do like his theory of stopping the nickel and dime procedures that have been on the rise. The steady small decline of yearly visitors tells that story, and the utter hatred of these practices on this forum, lol."
"My opinion is casinos in May opening but distancing still in effect. Travel bans being lifted with some quick method of testing people available, end of June. This will be needed daily for manufacturing to resume, too. No large groups this year. So, empty sport events, no shows, no conventions. There is a risk of new waves, so controls needed but we can’t continue like we are for months."

I thought it was a very well written and well thought out article. I was especially pleased with the hopeful quality at the end.
I wanted to add that Vegas was really betting that the convention business would be their next stopgap. The teleconferencing and working from home proved that people getting together in the same location is just not necessary unless you're also trying to inspire teamwork and bonding. All those convention halls could be white elephants. Vegas also has to work at getting back all those Southern Califorinia tourists who've abandoned Vegas for the local Indian Casinos. Getting rid of the parking fees is a start.
"I have not posted that often. It doesn't mean that I don't read the forums A LOT when I'm getting amped up for my semi annual trips. I have seen much criticism of people who think ""the casinos should be open now"". My wife and I started voluntarily distancing on March 6th in Seattle area. I believe some sacrifice is ok for the societal benefits. I am not ok ""writing"" off seniors or any class of human beings. When is enough enough? Those of you who don't think it is ok to open I ask when? We can't beat a virus to 0 unless it's Ebola and you can be identified by bleeding eyes. The infection rate WILL rise again inevitably. Are you really ok with surrending your liberties for safety that is impossible to guarantee. Do we need to have our medical papers in order and be stopped by police to prove it before we can return to eating in a restaurant? Should we wait until there MIGHT be a vaccine? Might be?I'm asking because many of you on both sides are articulate and if you're willing to post about LV you must have reasoned opinions in your nonTA lives.If the virus WILL spread, if the virus MAY mutate, should we be destroying our economy now? For how much longer?Is the media sensationalizing for ratings? I know there were people in Italy dying in hospital hallways. What if that is UNAVOIDABLE?Is it totally crazy to reopen society and let people who are afraid stay home? Right now there seems to be on ALL media the idea that we'll prove we have antibodies before returning to work!?That is a dangerous surrender of civil liberties in my opinion and I'm not ok with it.I am willing to continue to quarantine until 5/4 but NOT ONE DAY longer.Am I a crazy fool or an American with a reasonable view point?Thanks for reading."
Not one day longer ?. ..a crazy fool

"#18 and 19, Reporter-Who ultimately decides when we can re-open the country? Dr. Fauci-the Virus will tell us when it's appropriate to re-open the country!"
Can you answer all my questions fairly? These are serious issues with non emotional pros and cons. Each with different weight.
So if it started with one case you think zero cases is appropriate? His is an opinion and it may be costing you. It definitely costing a lot of people.
"The article made no mention of the 100,000s or millions of laid off employees and their families. Policy makers, government officials don’t have the luxury of sitting in an ivory tower, they need to figure out alternatives and compromises how to get people back to work. That is very urgent. It is not just about profit and loss, business or economy, sock it to the rich, the urgent task is the laid off workers. Author didn’t think about them at all, government can’t stop thinking about them.The very people who hate the corporations and gleeful of their misfortune are the people who need them the most, jobs and food on the table."
"""I am willing to continue to quarantine until 5/4 but NOT ONE DAY longer.Am I a crazy fool or an American with a reasonable view point?""Based on your arbitrary deadline and ALL CAPS yelling, I'm going to pick ""not reasonable."""
The state of Washington is under stay at home until then.
My home state is under quarantine until then.
"Nobody is thinking about 17 million laid off workers, their families, mortgages, rents, food, 100 million Americans. Whenever government officials talked about reopening, they are attacked as greedy and only care about profit and rich people. You don’t need to worry about the rich and retired, they don’t need to work. When you attack reopening, you are attacking 100 million Americans who need to have work and income. The middle class and poor you pretend you care about.Think about the nationwide economic consequences.Edited: 2:42 pm, April 10, 2020 "
"I am Mac, because I too run a business. Considering how many constituents are out of a job thanks to the policies of their government, it would be fitting if government ""leaders"" there's a joke, would forfeit their salary or at least a portion of it in solidarity with the people they represent while the lockdown is ongoing. But they won't because that would require them to put their money where their mouth is. See how their own policies actually effect people."
Steve M:Many of us up here are keeping an eye on Germany and Merkel. Most likely that includes our politicians. They are ahead of us in Canada. Betting is she will start easing restrictions by month end. If Germany’s initial steps look successful guessing we follow a similar model. Meanwhile we are in a holding pattern to “flatten the curve”. I don’t believe our politicians have any idea how things will go. To me a key point will be when the automotive OEMs decide its financially worth it to start up. In the meantime
One problem with the article is more than once he said resort fees are hidden fees. They may be awful but they're not hidden.

"The article is irresponsible, he didn’t think about the people. I am paying my employees, some of their husbands lost jobs, the salaries I am paying them are their only income. Can’t do that for 6-12 months. Not acceptable and not sustainable.Some of my Las Vegas tenants can’t pay rent, they are all waiting for the government checks or casinos hotels to reopen. Can’t do that for 6-12 months. I can wait or give them a break, not acceptable and not sustainable.At some point, we all need to stick our necks out, find a way to reopen and stay healthy. They are many ways snd many alternative ideas, that’s another complicated subjects. The article is irresponsible, he didn’t think about the people."
"Somehow with all the arguments about reopening everything and all the layoffs unemployment insurance has not been mentioned. You state determines how much your payment for regular unemployment is. Then the federal government adds on an additional 600/week on top of that for at least 13 weeks. It seems another bill will pass that will extend it an additional 13 weeks. Total of 26 weeks. I will adresse the state I live in. Maximum benefit is 504/week than add on 600 for a total of 1100. That equals on a yearly basis close to 60,000. The 600 is an addition to it no matter what your benefit is. That's a nice sum. Another example is if you made 20/hr which equals 800/week your benefit is 400/week plus 600 total of 1,000. That would be more than you made being employed. Not the end of the world for a lot of the unemployed.Edited: 5:15 pm, April 10, 2020 "
"You wouldn’t think so if you made 300 calls to the unemployment office still unable to get through, or waiting in line for unemployment and food lines, if you have been watching TV news. You wouldn’t think so if you have kids, rent and mortgage to pay. Why are the food lines so long?"
"""What is the average salary in the US 2019?Using information from the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019, the BLS claims that in that quarter, the median income for a full-time wage or salary worker on a weekly basis was $936.

Is this really bad? YES but don't ignore what the government is doing also. The 600/week will be coming very very shortly back dated to first day of unemployment. Don't exaggerate things to make your point."
"“That is a dangerous surrender of civil liberties in my opinion and I'm not ok with it.” - I wouldn’t be afraid of that with this regime. Now, if the liberals were in charge, that’s when you should be afraid of civil liberties being taken away. That’s the current liberal agenda is to make America a Socialist country. This regime is trying to protect our citizens, hence the idea of a border wall among other good ideas that are only seen as racist by the liberals, whereas normal folks view it as protecting our citizens. Think about it, most other countries have stricter guidelines regarding letting immigrants and/or refugees come into and reside in their country, yet no one is calling them racist. Their citizens know it is better for their country as a safety measure. 13Edited: 5:56 pm, April 10, 2020 "

"I have no idea what Mac's point was. Something like, for the good of the economy we should go out and risk dying or carry a virus that doesn't harm us but kills someone else. Did I understand him correctly? Perhaps I didn't."
"“This means ditching the nickel-and-dime approach to the customer, and taking the opportunity to do away with hidden fees– including resort fees – entirely.” Does anyone else see the irony of this? Folks saying it’s such a well written article are the same that say resort fees aren’t hidden fees, which I agree with because it’s true. They aren’t hidden as everyone here is correctly quick to point out. 13"
"News flash for some of you. Self employed individuals don’t receive unemployment benefits. Also 60,000 people in the USA died during the 2017 flu season. This economic shut down lasts into May and an economic depression will be upon us. That will cost more lives than the Coronavirus"

Here's an article from the New York Times explaining unemployment in more detail. Published today. Here’s What the Relief Packages Give Self-Employed Workershttps:/…
"Good for you Steve,response 18. We will have to build up herd immunity. We cannot cower to this as it seems that it may well have a morbidity rate not much more then a nasty flu virus. It may be that those that are fearful in a few more weeks will stay at home and those that need to work or wish to live their lives,go about their lives."
Totally agree. Those of us who want to live should be allowed to live. Those who want to stay in their homes feel free to do so.
"""Also 60,000 people in the USA died during the 2017 flu season""Considering the time lag of about two weeks and factoring in that deaths began in earnest two weeks ago, we've had 18,000 deaths so far in 2 weeks. That works out to 468,000 deaths per year. Mind you, unlike the flu, which circulates throughout the country on average of 4 times a year, thankfully much of the population wasn't exposed to covid before we started isolating. If it had, and it will get a chance to if we ease up too soon, then the deaths would sky rocket past 468,000.So listen, argue away over what the endgame is. But if you're STILL using the ""The flu is worse!"" argument at this point then you're nothing more than a braying jackass.Edited: 6:53 pm, April 10, 2020 "
For the life of me I can't understand people whose response to seeing social distancing having a positive effect is to immediately start screaming we need to stop doing it too soon.
Agree with Upstate..it is such an uneducated thought that the Flu is worse then Covid...even the current occupier of WH has walked that back
"It has been much longer than 2 weeks that this has been going on. Didn’t make this is no worse than the flu argument. I am just telling you what the numbers are. This will not reach 60,000 deaths in the US. Hopefully much lower. Whatever the final count is I will be closer than Fauci’s prediction"
Hope this helps. Read it of you have time. Then again as they say: you can't change stupidCOVID-19 has been compared to the flu. Experts say that's wrong.https:/…
Maybe it’s the “experts” that are stupid. None of their models on what the virus will do has been close to being correct.
“ Those of us who want to live should be allowed to live. ” Ironic choice of words.
"“ None of their models on what the virus will do has been close to being correct.”The models predicted what would have happened had actions not been taken. Actions, drastic actions, were taken. Therefore the “if nothing were done” projections haven’t come to pass."
Why so many disgruntled people on this th. read. It must be too many cases of cabin fever. What will these threads look like after two more weeks of social distancing.
"Fauci’s prediction of 100,000 to 240,000 dead was made on March 31, 2020 and was made with social distancing and economic shutdown in his model. This was supposed to happen by April 15. Thankfully his prediction will not even be close to being accurate."
"“...why are the lines for free food so long, and people in dire financial straits , after 2-3 weeks of being furloughed or laid off?“ - Qdog, with all due respect, I’m sure you know the answer to your question. 13"
Possible. But I am glad he placed a travel ban from China at the end of January. Even though he was called a racist for it

"2salty...what actions exactly would have been taken 70 days ago with a different President in charge? Based on limited info from a Dishonest China, WHO supporting the dishonest information from China, minimal case data in USA, etc. do you think a President Biden for example would have shut Vegas down in January for? And the rest of the USA economy? Canceled the Super Bowl in February maybe?"
"Yes, it seems as though travelers from Wuhan, might have been “out and about,” as early as late Sept, or early Oct.Then NYC, and SFO both embraced the Chinese New Year, and urged the residents to gather, and embrace the events.Then, without any sort of H/U, poor New Orleans hosted Carnival.At least the USA President shut down visitors from China, when he did - even raising the ire of the WHO, which called him all sorts of names, and public ally ridiculed him.No, the apple falls close to the WHO/China “tree.”Now, how will this play out in LV?Not sure, at this point.Hunt"

"“The WHO stated in mid-February that the window for containment was narrowing,”You earlier mentioned 70 days? Mid Feb is still not 70 days prior.

"Looking at a very rough timeline, it now seems that China might have “shared” this virus, as early as Autumn.Several Chinese, and the WHO sources were silent.Things were happening, but most folk had no clue, what.Again, the Chinese and WHO were silent.Then, “suddenly,” things exploded in Wuhan - or did they?The WHO, and China kept quiet.The world pandemic exploded.The WHO and China kept silent.Only, when pressure from the world yelled, did either comment, and their first replies were “Do not worry.Nothing to see here folk.”Then, the dedication hit the oscillator!Do you care about what really happened?If so, follow along:China was weaponize go this virus.They sent travelers all over the world, to spread it - with the travelers unaware, that they were playing “Typhoid Mary.”The virus escaped in Wuhan, infecting too many to hide.Have you wondered why most of China does not have this issue??Just think about it. Study the timeline, for only a moment. Study the spread patterns, as best you can.Form you own opinions.Now, back to Las Vegas!Hunt"
"2salty...so, you really have no answer for what actions a different President would have taken 70 days ago? The reality is that a different man/woman in the White House would not have materially changed the spread of a virus , when the country at the epicenter didn’t cooperate with the rest of the world."

"The right question and article is: How to reopen Las Vegas?It is not if they should reopen or why? Stupid questions. Reopening is a forgone conclusion. When? They will figure it out in due time. How? There are ways to manage it. Temperature check at entrance? Mask? Gloves? Face shield? Ridiculous? Maybe not, maybe it makes sense and welcomed. You can’t stop gamblers, temperature check? mask and gloves? Bring it on. Don’t like them? Don’t come."
"If you have to get your temperature checked at every hotel/casino entrance, and wear masks and gloves... they might as well stay closed.How are you supposed to drink a cold one with a hazmat suit on?"
I can see us getting temperature checks before we get on a plane or maybe part of a scanning process before leaving the airport into the general public.
To the poster who said that his wife was on a call with the CDC and WHO for two weeks but WHO is no longer on the call. I know that our President is honest and ethical but EVER consider it just might be politically motivated that WHO is no longer on the call. Not that our President would ever do something like that.

Regardless of how deadly it is it will only need 1 case to resurge. So what number of cases until we can take our foot off the pedal?"
"Why re-open the Las Vegas Strip?Because residents across the entire state of Nevada (NOT just in Las Vegas) rely on tourism income from that glorious 4.2 mile stretch.People want to pretend that money doesn't matter, but try living without it."
"“ Our government, along with all others around the world had no chance ”Well it certainly didn’t help that the president’s initial reaction, echoed on some news channels, was that the virus threat was a “Democratic hoax”."

"From snopes..What's TrueDuring a Feb. 28, 2020, campaign rally in South Carolina, President Donald Trump likened the Democrats' criticism of his administration's response to the new coronavirus outbreak to their efforts to impeach him, saying ""this is their new hoax."" During the speech he also seemed to downplay the severity of the outbreak, comparing it to the common flu.What's FalseDespite creating some confusion with his remarks, Trump did not call the coronavirus itself a hoax."
Thanks Qdog; I was about to post the same clarification.
"That's the trouble with someone who is as articulate as, and possesses the vocabulary and debating skills of, a 7yo.No one has any idea wth he's talking about."
"“You’re going to have suicides by the thousands” Trump said at a Fox News town hall. “People get tremendous anxiety and depression, and you have suicides over things like this when you have terrible economies. You have death. Probably and — I mean, definitely — would be in far greater numbers than the numbers that we’re talking about with regard to the virus.”If the number of people dying from Covid suicides approaches those dying from the virus, then economies should reopen sooner rather than later."
"Statistics don’t lie but liars use statistics. Folks just remember than you can manipulate statistics in any manner to make your point. Rush Limbaugh was a master at this. As to the fatalities it is estimated that 80-90% of the people who have past from this have had sever life threatening conditions that with the Covid19 caused the death. There are a couple of terms for this like dual mortality. That being said, someone on hospice care who was dying from cancer, also had Covid19. They are counted as a dying from Covid19. That was according to OAN. So how many healthy people died from this? I don't know but it seems that these stats are being manipulated. I mean who do you trust. The media has their own agenda. CNN has always been the doomsday network to get better ratings. Unlike the AIDS epidemic were healthy people were dying and we had a relatively estimate of the numbers. The deaths were counted as some who died of AIDS not pneumonia which was the technical cause of death."
Oh for the record I believe that 80/90% is high. Life threatening condition can be manipulated also.
I have seen DTC manipulate the data on his sports predictions. He is about 60% accurate but acts as if he is in the high 90’s.
"I thought #104 was just using a play on words, but I guess it was serious. lolAnd yes, he did say that."
"Going back to the OP, Vegas to us is a fun destination and walking round in masks, social distancing etc isn't 'fun' so it isn't on our list until the pandemic is history. My understanding is that our exit strategy in the UK will include the vulnerable staying indoors (i.e. those who would have a higher chance of dying through advanced age or underlying health conditions) and the rest will gradually emerge to mix and become infected/immune so eventually it will be safer for the vulnerable to reappear. Our NHS will cope and the economy will creak into life again. The Strip will need foreign tourists when it reopens but, personally, I won't want to take extra risks by travelling to another country until I know my family and I have immunity. Good luck, we have had some amazing times in Vegas."
