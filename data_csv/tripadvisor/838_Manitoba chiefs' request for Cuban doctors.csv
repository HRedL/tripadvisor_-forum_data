from CBC:Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland cool to Manitoba chiefs' request for Cuban doctorsLast week Southern Chiefs Organization asked PM for Cuban doctors to be allowed in to help First Nationshttps:/…cuba-doctors-sco-freeland-1.5515416
Wasn't this all begun to address the situation BEFORE the COVID-19 pandemic? The government response seems to imply that this is something new.
"this was being asked even before this virus showed up. it seems alot of Canadian rural areas get doctors from other countries. i guess why not Cuba, if the Doctor is fully qualified. but on the other hand should we/they take a Cuban Doctor out of Cuba now when we maybe have enough of our own Doctors?"
"This request was very recent, see an article a few days earlier:https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/coronavir…But you are also right that they also requested a doctor in February.""Health care partnership talksDaniels went with a delegation of First Nations leaders and health technicians from Manitoba to Cuba at the end of February to discuss developing a health care partnership with the Caribbean island country. Under the partnership, Cuban doctors would go north to provide care and potential Indigenous health care workers would go south for training.""Edited: 12:00 pm, April 02, 2020 "
Before the pandemic these remote communities felt that the level of healthcare they were getting was inadequate and began work to get Cuban doctors to address that. Now that we are dealing with COVID-19 I doubt that those communities will find comfort in these reassurances from the Federal Government.

"The first article I posted was from Monday, mar 30. This was the response to their request from the government here."
Thanks for the links.It was my impression that this had been in the works for a while. Perhaps I'm wrong.
and our deputy minister freeland [ trump with hair ] is afraid they will destabilize canada and the U.S. or invade us! so no cuban doctors! carol e. already emailed my mp!
Very good points Mike :)
"Since Mike #9 brought up the subject, I will finally ask two thoughts I have had since this originally came up.1) What obligation is there to tell a patient that the person treating them is not a real doctor as they think of such but a medical person with less education and qualifications?2) What does the patient say with the doctor's first words are ""¿como estas?"" I know many Cuban doctors but only one who speaks English. Remember the language skills of most Cuban doctors are not like the ones you meet in the resort clinic.Now this is nothing negative about Cuban doctors. And, just curious as what Canada does is up to them not me as I am not Canadian."
We have many doctors here in Quebec driving taxis or doing other jobs because they were Doctors in the country they lived before coming to Canada .There license as a Doctor are not recognise in Canada why should the Cubans be any different rules are for all of them . Mike is correct Canada or the Provinces all have a very strict policy and i don't see them changing the rules just to accommodate the Manitoba Chiefs with Cuban Doctors .
"12: your right Mikey. I know a pediatrician that came from Maldova. She could not practice here because of the language barrier. English is a major hurdle for her and likely those in a lot of required jobs. So she delivers food trays in the hospital, and her husband, an engineer, drives hack.Edited: 4:54 pm, April 02, 2020 "
"and our colleges of physicians and surgeons consistently cover up very bad doctors in every province they are a closed shop for themselves just like lawyers. ever tried to shut down a bad doctor in canada ? carol e.. give me a cuban doctor any day!Edited: 10:48 pm, April 02, 2020 "
They will say that their primary concern is for the health and safety of Canadians. I'm not claiming that they are entirely self-interested. The truth is somewhere in the middle. Teachers and others fall into the same category.
"and I would still trust the cuban doctors before our politicos! carol e. as for defecting when they arrive....well...I'm sure our native people would be glad to have them rather than the bloated political bureaucracy they're stuck with now! carol e.Edited: 11:35 am, April 03, 2020 "
Carol do you tell your Canadian doctor that you much prefer the Cubano Doctor because they are better. Im sure they will be very happy with you .Just be gracious they are there to help you out when you are sick and they do the best they can to help people out which they sure do .
"because most Canadian doctors do NOT want to practice in remote areas, especially NOT in Indigenous communitiesWe have a doctor shortage crisis in CanadaNot allowing Cuban doctors is crazy; they are the best doctorsThe request from the Manitoba chiefs happened before the pandemic started: three chiefs travelled to Cuba to ask if there is a possibility on getting Cuban doctors to come to Canada to assist their community which are deprived from having enough Canadian doctors to care for themFYI: . As soon as the pandemic began Cuba, automatically as always, showed its solidarity with people around the globe. The 1st incident was when a British cruise ship having 682 passengers on board with five passengers having the corona which was refused entry in numerous Caribbean countries was allowed to dock in Cuba. The Cuban Foreign Minister stated at that point “Let’s reinforce healthcare, solidarity and international cooperation”.Since that 1st act of solidarity during the pandemic Cuba has been able to send medical missions to 23 countries including the so called developed countries such as Italy and Spain. Above that it has also shared its own medicine against COVID with the rest of the world. These humane examples of international solidarity have garnered numerous organizations and nations attention to nominate the Cuban Henry Reeve Medical Brigades for the Nobel Peace Prize for selfless work in saving lives during this dark global time."
