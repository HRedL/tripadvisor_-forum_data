But when all of this is over, and the tourists return to NYC, when people complain about the high cost of going to NYC museums, please consider the cost of running them, the job creation, the entertainment, artistic, educational, and historical value....all of it. Museums are not profit making ventures, unlike the hotels and travel industry, who are also seeking aid. Just food for thought. The members of Congress who have requested this aid are taking a big hit."
"If the govt doesn't do it then I suggest they ask the social climbing billionaires on their boards to stop and just think for a moment how grateful they are for the many psychic & material benefits they have gotten from their board ""service"" and just dig a little deeper into those bespoke pockets to bail out the museums.Ditto all those rich gorgons on the hospital boards.

"""but I have not been able to figure out why so many doctors smart enough to make millions running our ""best"" hospitals didn't feel a need to act."" with what money? New York Hospitals usually get stuck taking care of lots of uninsured people where they don't make any money. Unfortunately NYC hospitals aren't the best by any means. We have a couple of really good ones and then we have a whole bunch of one star hospitals. The people with money have high end insurance and go to the best hospitals. The uninsured go to poorly funded hospitals which have a difficult time retaining staff. Money needs to come from the government to fund public hospitals and the governments are never giving enough. You want to blame someone blame the politicians."

"The best thing is to start cutting the salary of these athletes, people who are CEO's, etc."
"#2 NYC hospitals (and yes NYPres and NYU) get huge subsidies from the state to cover the uninsured. And, as previously reported by NY Times,they have frequently failed to disclose right to that money to patients, instead choosing to take money from state AND continue to bill patients til the end of time, apparently hoping to collect twice for same care.#3 Yes, I understand there may have been supply chain problems, but why in the name of God couldn't the heads of hospitals like NYPres and NYU -- smart, savvy, well-connected people making multiple millions a year each -- have gone to some of their powerful government contacts? They just sit there and wring their hands for a couple of months? That's unconscionable."
"@DeltaWing Agree, I feel this shortage of masks and PPE is sadly not unique to US. My cousin is a doc in Toronto, and she told me that the hospitals are almost out or really shot on Masks, PPE. She is a doc, and she had a hard time getting a test due to very strict protocols dues to a shortage of tests.Even South Korea and Taiwan have a severe shortage of Masks and PPE. Same in Spain etc."
"I am unsure why if someone is a “billionaire”, they are also described as “social climbing”. Seems like they’re already there. In any event, not that I I think anyone has been totally wiped out, but there is certainly quite a bit of fear as even gazillionaires have seen their net worth reduced by 30%. Not like they’re going on soup lines, but it’s scary. I also saw the aid package being proposed in the House has funding for the Kennedy Center, which is certainly not as accessible to the masses, as, say, the Met. I hope that when we see the details of the aid package, it has real aid for NY, the hardest hit, not just pork for any state that has a powerful member of Congress pulling strings. While I completely and fully agree that private funding from those must financially blessed is optimal, we see the need for everyone who can step up, big or little, to help with employee funds, cultural institutions, blood banks, charities, etc etc. And the government role is critical.Edited: 11:11 am, March 25, 2020 "
Kennedy Center is getting $25M in the Senate bill.

"Right. You can buy your way onto some boards, not others. My underlying point, which was probably only understood in my own head, is that there are good people and bad people, and everything in between at every level of income and/or wealth. And there are good people who do bad things, and very bad people who do good things (look, the Kochs are not on my personal list of good people, but happy they gave Lincoln Center so much money). Where would universities, hospitals, and the arts be without all of that private money? Do I wish that there was some kind of metric that ensured that the lowest paid worker at any company was somehow tied to the CEO salary? Um, yeah. That would be my personal choice. But many of the gazillionaires in NYC have stepped up generously to support our institutions. I hope that they keep doing so. I hope more do. But that doesn't change the fact that we are in an emergency situation right now, and I'm not sure private philanthropy alone can save all of the things that need saving. (and may not be the most effective allocation of resources. To wit: a friend of mine was able to manufacture 10,000 masks, but can't connect with the right procurement person to donate them - I'm working on it. They have had an influx of masks, such that it is now not the most urgent need. But people did what they could. Will they all get used? Who knows?)"
"#10 - Glad to see you appear to be content with having your healthcare rationed by a gatekeeper employed by a for profit business, are not worried about catching a disease from someone who is uninsured and does not seek medical care in a timely manner and will presumably decline to enroll in Medicare when you become eligible since any whiff of socialism is distasteful.Not all reform proposals are a slippery slope to full fledged socialism. While I have problems with most of the current reform proposals surely we can agree this is a problem that needs some serious thought and sensible solutions.What would you prescribe?"

He expressly does NOT want his name on anything. He writes checks liberally and generously, and specifically asks that his name not be used. Those are the people who fund the stuff like masks and uniforms. But we just don't know about them. He learned about giving quietly from his parents. People in his circles and larger circles know he's got the money and ask him for it all of the time. Sure, he's sat on a board or two. He does the work AND gives the money.

When your net worth is in excess of $50 billion you can do such things.
"I personally think the Met, the AMHN and the Moma should be OK. Its the smaller ones that might not surive. The smaller ones get smaller crowds and have smaller rich friends and less clout to get government money"
"#20 That was the late David Koch who gave the money to renovate the plaza at the front of the Met. When the gift was announced they (actually the Met director who was later fired, though not because of this -- more likely because he made poor financial decisions & had affair w/underling) made a big deal of saying it wouldn't be named for Koch, but in the end it was."
">>>But while you and me [sic] may write checks for $50 or $100 or even $1000, he’s writing them for many many many multiples of that.<<<Of course, his net worth is many multiples of ours. Not sure that billionaires really need defending, but whatever. It’s always been striking - if not totally surprising - to me that on average, and as a percentage of income, lower income people are far and away the most generous segment of the population."
"Being on a major board means giving in a major way and often. Frequently, you will find mention that members of the board bailed out a place in difficulty. If you look at the stone tablets around the grand stairway at the Met Museum, you will find many familiar names as benefactors (perhaps $10+ million) including Mike Bloomberg and major corporations. The museum is a monument to private generosity with 80% of its objects being donated. Unfortunately, Americans have always regarded the arts as elitist or morally suspect. Several Protestant groups insisted their members not attend anything in a theater. Today, traditional culture has fallen out of popularity and are patronized only by we old folks. Art museums have fared better, but only in a superficial way. Young people do not study a work of art, but linger only so long as to take a photo or a selfie imitating the pose of the subject."
"""Not sure that billionaires really need defending, but whatever.""A story is always about where you begin it and where you end it. There is nothing inherently evil about wealthy people. And yet, they are always attacked on this board, which is sort of funny. It's a travel board. We're starting from the point of people with disposable income, beyond basic life functions. So why do people always attack the wealthy here? Why so much class warfare? There is nothing congenitally noble about people with no money or people with a lot of it. As Kaye noted in another discussion, it's what you do with it. So, if people would stop attacking people with more wealth, there would be no need to defend them.There are people with no money who would give the shirt off their back to someone who needed it. There are people who won't. It's not the money that corrupts. It's something else. I like to think that if I had a lot money, I would still try to do as much for others, if not much, much more on the giving ($) level rather than just deeds, than I do today."
Oh those noble billionaires thinking of everyone else and not themselves. Its not like billionaires get tax deductions on charitable giving. Oh wait.
"I think it's that there are so many attention seeing cretins with money (or the appearance of money - possibly ""big hat, no cattle"") who create a stereotype in the popular mind. Other than a few famous for popular cultural reasons most people can't name a lot of the richest. It makes an easy target for discontent and ridiculeNo it's not ""fair"" to the responsible ones, especially those who do good - but no stereotype is."
"Oy, c'mon. There's not all good or all bad anyone, rich or poor. Far be it from me to defend any one group of people. And a tax deduction for charity is worth more to someone of less mean than those gazillionaires. (and didn't the value of tax deductions for charity go down significantly in the last tax overhaul?)On a board that constantly lauds restaurants like The River Cafe, when there are hungry people out there, it's kind of silly. To a hungry person, a dinner at TRC is more than their food for a month."

Stereotypes are rarely kind or fair.
""". (and didn't the value of tax deductions for charity go down significantly in the last tax overhaul?)"" actually the amount you can deduct has increased — to 60 percent of your adjusted gross income, up from 50 percent. However, because of the changes and the standard deductions you would need $12,000 in deductions as an individual ($24,000 for a couple) before you could take charitable deductions. That rules out most people right there so not only are fewer people with less money able to take the charitable deduction, but the rich are actually able to take a larger deduction than they were able to before the tax reform."
