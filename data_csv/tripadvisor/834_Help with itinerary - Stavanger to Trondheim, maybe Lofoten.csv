"My family (husband and I in our mid-50s, 17&19 year old kids, from NY/USA) are planning to visit Norway in August for 12-14 days. I have always longed to see the stunning scenic beauty of Norway. We are interested in seeing the spectacular fjords, driving beautiful roads with water and mountain views, scenic boat rides, exploring charming medieval towns, fishing villages, medieval history and churches. We are comfortable driving 2-5 hours in a day. When we travel we plan to cover a lot of ground, but we modify if we need to slow the pace. We like casual but nice hotels/apartments. I have put together a very rough 1st draft itinerary. I would deeply appreciate any thoughts about it so I can revise it into a 2nd draft, and begin to book our stays asap. Here is my tentative itinerary, followed by some questions: Day 1 - Arrive Stavanger airport, bus to Stavanger, rest, explore town a bit, overnight in StavangerDay 2 - Morning Lysefjord cruise, followed by afternoon hike to the Pulpit Rock, overnight in StavangerDays 3 -4 - Travel to Bergen by scenic bus ride(?) and stay there 2 nights - explore Bergen, ride up Floyen, explore Bryggen. What neighborhood to stay in Bergen?Day 5 - Rent a car in Bergen, drive towards Gudvangen/Flam. Stop en route to see Skjersfossen? Arrive in Gudvangen; visit Viking Valley if there’s time? Drive to Flam in time for ride on Flam scenic railway (Is this Flamsbana?) - stay in Flam or Gudvangen? Day 6 - Morning - fast cruise to Naeroyfjord from Gudvangen to Flam. After cruise, my husband or I will take the shuttle bus back to Gudvangen to pick up the rental car, then return to Flam. Explore Flam more, visit Undredal - stay in Flam or Gudvangen againDay 7 - From Gudvangen, drive up to Stegastein viewpoint. Then continue to Laerdal, stop at Borgund stave church, then continue to Sognal with a ferry crossing from Fodnes to Mannheller. Visit Norwegian Glacier museum, stop in Mundal, then overnight in Sognal? Day 8 - 5-hour drive to Geiranger - Stop at Drivandefossen waterfall on the way, then take scenic road FV.55 to Lom, then FV.63 to Geiranger. Scenic toll road to Dalsnibba viewpoint over Geiranger fjord. Overnight in Geiranger?Day 9 - Start the day with scenic fjord cruise on Geirangerfjord, then drive from Geiranger to Hellesylt to see the fjord and explore a bit by car. Visit a town - perhaps Olden? Overnight in Geiranger?Day 10-11 - Drive up the Eagle Road to Eidsdal, ferry ride to Linge. Drive up Trollstigen. Reach Alesund late afternoon. Explore Alesund; overnight for 2 nights, what are good areas to stay?Day 12 - Drive the Atlantic Ocean road, taking time to go slowly. Ferry to Molde, then drive to Bud, then Kristiansund. Is Kristiansund a good place to visit? Overnight where?Day 13 - Drive to Trondheim and return rental car. Day 14 - Fly home to NY.Here are my questions:1) Overall any thoughts? Does the timing seem reasonable, am I planning to spend the wrong amount of time in the wrong places, am I wasting time, do I not understand the logistics? 2) Any suggestions about how best to get from place to place, which train or boat or bus rides should be booked ahead of time, areas to find hotels, would be appreciated.3) This could be my only trip to Norway and I would love to be able to spend a few days in the spectacular Lofoten. Is there anything I can easily omit to substitute Lofoten? Maybe Bergen? And if so, then should I return the rental car in Alesund and fly to Lofoten, then fly back to Stavanger before heading for home? 4) Are any of these driving roads scary? I’m not a fan of driving while worrying about crashing into fast oncoming traffic or plunging over a cliff while making a turn. Are there any alternatives to driving I should strongly consider?THANK YOU SO MUCH!"
"Flån is convenient by Public transport, but there is no need to focus on Flåm in particular. Flåm Railway (Flåmsbana) is a fine piece of engineering, but the scenery does not differ from the rest of Western Norway. The boat ride Gudvangen-Flåm is great, alternatives are Gudvangen-Kaupanger and Hellesylt-Geiranger. In any case there will be fjord crossings by regular car ferries. And in this area there are fjords all over, in fact you can not avoid fjords. Geiranger is like Flåm one of the top cruise ports, so will be crowded in summer. I would not focus on Geiranger, but passing through is Nice, particularly if you drive to Mt Dalsnibba.Small towns and villages of Norway are in general not particularly interesting. Churches are a as rule of thumb the only interesting building. Flåm for instance has fine wooden Church. Norddal (near Geiranger) has a wooden Church in a style particular to this area. In sognefjord area there are several stave churches, the only wooden churches from the middle ages. There is also one in LomNorway does not have a long tradition in masonry building, so few Things survived from the middle ages, and towns are mostly Young.. Some key churches are from stone, for instancen in Aurland, Voss and Dale (Luster). Bergen of course several."
"Bergen is the most (or only?) important historical town in Western Norway. Because of frequent fires the oldest wooden houses are from around 1700, but the city layout and many streets in the historical centre are from the middle ages. Bergen is still (I think) the biggest wooden town in Europe.Ålesund is a Young but particular town. A short day is usually enough, you can stay overnight, but 2 Nights usually not needed. Lærdal and Nordfjordeid also has fine wooden centres, but small. Olden has a fine wooden old Church. Kristiansund, Molde and Åndalsnes were completed destroyed at the beginning of WW2, and rebuilt in a dull postwar style (although Kristiansund was deliberatly designed as a model town). The government's evacuation from Molde was a key moment in modern Norwegian history as it allowed Norway to maintain an intact government in exile during the occupation.Roads mostly pass right through villages, so there is usually no detour to visit. 3) Consider skipping Kristiansund and Atlantic road. I would not skip Bergen. 4) Scary perhaps, but safe. Norway's roads are (contrary to impressions) the safest in World, traffic is generally slow, allow plenty time and dont rush. Trollstigen for instance did never have serious accidents since 1936 when the road opened. Scenic roads are generally narrow and airy"

This summer? Chances are that you plan to arrive too early and before the Covid-19 dust has settled. So consider postponing to next year.
"There are no bad options when traveling to Norway. There are a lot of highlights in your journey with a lot of nice waterfalls. The reason why I travel every year to Norway. If you need moer information about the waterfalls: www.europeanwaterfalls.com/countries/norway/I think going to Lofoten is to much. It is beautiful but it is a long journey to get there. I should focus on the Itinerary you already have. Nothing wrong with that.Normally Flambanen is busy, book in front and find a seat on the right side of the train (best views on the waterfalls and the valley)If you stay on the main roads there will be no scary road but sometimes the roads can get quite narrow. I hope it is possible to go to Norway in August. I think so. It gets better here in Europe every week. So I have good hopes.Have fun:)"
"Norway may possibly have the world record in waterfalls (difficult to count....). The European waterfall database mentioned by Olaf lists 350 of the best, there are many more. Even the not so famous Furebergfossen in Hardanger is impressive and surprise if unprepared when you come around the bend."
"I don’t see that it would be possible for foreign tourists to visit Norway in August. I hope I’m wrong. Travelers risk being super spreaders of the virus. And our health care in Norway don’t have the capacity to handle foreign tourists in addition to locals.Edited: 2:36 pm, April 28, 2020 "
