I have heard there is an epidemic of Dengue Fever in Bangkok. I am planning a trip to Thailand Dec '08. Should I cancel?
"I say no but up to you. I have trip planned in late July and late Feb next year, including outer lying areas, and I am not cancelling.C'est la vie. Regards,Martian"
"Dengue fever is always an issue in much of SEA. For the past year or so, the number of cases in SEA has been up from previous years. Dengue tends to go in 10 year cycles, peaking about every 10 years. www.medicinenet.com/dengue_fever/article.htm might be helpful for you. Also, google dengue fever to get further information.I would not cancel. Use repellent with DEET. Cover up as much as is practical. Enjoy your trip."
"As well as applying DEET & covering up with light colored clothing with sleeves, long pants, socks & shoes you can get clothes with pyrethrium in them or soak some of your existing clothes with pyrethrium (or however you spell it) where the protection is meant to last for about 3 or 4 washes on your clothes.CheersHD"
"Dengue fever in Thailand is not a problem at all. Normally the carrier of this fever is only the house mosquito (the one that has white and black stripes on its body) which always fly out in day time. If you live in a clean hotel room and won't sleep in daytime, there is no chance to get this kind of fever at all. But if you would like to walk into some tropical forests in Thailand, you have to beware of the forest mosquito because they carry more serious fever than denque fever. "
"Dengue fever IS a problem. The Thai press have many stories about it and many people in Bangkok have caught it, and there have been a few deaths for the more serious varieties. I know several people who have had it recently. The same applies throughout SE Asia right now."
Should I worry?Me and my family (four kids) are going to Koh Samui on next Friday..........It's an tropical island...
"I just returned from Thailand after a 2,5 week trip. Take the necessary precautions, repellents based on deet, socks, long sleeves and thin long pants. Else you will be bitten all the time. Guess I was lucky during my trip, but a guy I know was in Pattaya beginning of the year and he caught dengue fever.You will be more likely to catch any dengue fever in the outskirts of bangkok then in the main city center along the sukhumvit road around the lower numbered sois."
"Now I am thinking the beach may not be the best place to be. Is Chaing Mai safer, or are beaches other than Koh Chang safer...as far as Dengue Fever goes? I don't want to cancel."
