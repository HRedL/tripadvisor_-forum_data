What are the current health risks in Hong Kong?
cold & flu? because of the change of seasons - one day it's warm and humid and another chill and windy... also super strong air-con everywhere indoor
"Maria J, Welcome to the Hong Kong forum at TripAdvisor. Can you be more specific about what you are asking? Here is a link to the HK Health Department where you can find general static information regarding health in Hong Kong (see link) if this is what you're looking for. http://www.healthyhk.gov.hk/phisweb/en/"
The doctors in England are always trying to drum into us that cold is a virus and nothing to do with the cold/ambient temperature.
"Absolutely true VS, proved by the scientists & workers at Antarctic Research Stations, however some people's immune systems get depressed during winter so they pick up viruses more easily esp when confined to indoors & lack of UV light."
"Health risks? To me, none. I haven't had a shot of anything in a long time, and I don't go out thinking I will pick up diseases. Maintain good hygiene standards and wash your hands frequently."
"Many people have problems with the weather. It is hot and humid. For elderly people, not used to it, it can be a challenge."
"Main health risks:- air pollution (http://www.aqhi.gov.hk/en.html), currently low thanks to the summer monsoons. Winter is generally worse.- freezing air conditioners: the big issue here is temperature shocks. Outdoors it can be >30Â°C, indoors so cold your ears freeze off (I've once literally left a room that was so cold that after a few minutes my ears were hurting - I was walking around in t-shirt and shorts as it was so hot out there). Banks are a major offender, but many offices, malls and restaurants have their airconditioners set to ""way too cold for comfort"".Otherwise Hong Kong is pretty safe, health wise."
"I remember seeing dengue fever warning signs but don't recall the last time. Not sure if they've come down or if I just don't pay attention or take notice of them anymore, sort of like the Beware of Snakes signs. ;-)"

"#8 Dengue fever is not a serious risk in HK, compared to everywhere in Asia south of here. The reason for those signs is that it is endemic in parts of southern China, and the government posts lots of signs so that people clean mosquito breeding areas and prevent establishment of dengue in HK. So far they have been more-or-less successful, though there is the occasional (rare) local case. I just Googled for the relevant data: as of November 2014 there had been 3 documented cases of local mosquitoes transmitting dengue to people in Hong Kong. By comparison, as of November 2014 there had been 17,330 reported cases of dengue in Singapore."
"They run Dengue Fever commercials on TV every summer. Mosquitoes love me so I get bites here-and-there, but I don't go about thinking I will catch Dengue Fever. Of course, if you intend to go outdoors and do some hiking, it's a good idea to have bug spray and sunscreen.Air pollution is a problem if a person is asthmatic. Asthma sufferers should normally be bringing inhalers around though."
"there are around ten dengue cases a year in HK, and they are almost exclusively imported: people who contract the disease while travelling. Local cases are really rare."
Looking the wrong way when crossing the street (for people newly arrived from places where you drive on the right).
MTR at rush hour.
