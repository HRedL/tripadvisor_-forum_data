"The world is fragile.Humanity is fragile. Populism is dangerous. Humanity is both good and evil. Less IS more. (in particular, it is those that have the least in monetary terms, that are most generous).I miss Morocco and see it as a more ""advanced"" country than my own. (what an insult to call any country ""third world"")."
Has been interesting to follow how Morocco dealt with the crisis versus other countries - this is a good video which compares Morocco vs UK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXDD3m_aWqwMorocco seem to have done a great job of keeping the virus contained but I worry about the long term economic impact as Morocco continues their lockdown whereas a lot of Europe is now going slowly back to business
"Many African countries are showing much better results than Western ones, particularly as they lack the advanced health care systems. Senegal seems to be attracting particular praise. Whether this is to do with a younger population remains to be seen.What is clear is that early border closures, strong leadership and a complicit population appears to be key to controlling the virus. Today a WHO report from Spain https:/… implied that the virus appears to be dying out.One lives in hope (SARS and MERS just seemed to disappear)."
Morocco has done really well compared to the European countries. This has only been possible with a leadership that was concerned for the welfare of its population and acted quickly and decisively to deal with this threat whilst places like UK played around with heard immunity crap. None of this dilly dallying we have seen by our Boris Johnson and the incompetent leadership we have. What I think Morocco could have done better is to help the poorer segments of the society. I know they put measures in place but they don’t seem to be adequate.Hopefully the engine of the economy will start up very soon and tourists will begin flocking again.
"Lessons I have learnt:There are many factors that have meant different countries have been impacted differently by Covid-19, such as population density, obesity rates, how much the population travels around domestically and internationally, exposure to similar pathogens in daily life....etc, etc, etc.Countries like the DRC (and others) luckily had a pre-existing emergency medical structure that was implemented for the Ebola crisis (including PPE and testing networks) that was quickly utilised for Covid-19, which many western nations simply didn't have or need....at the time! Some African countries have given out face masks to every person over 5yrs.....where as I can't get one for a 100 miles in the UK where I live.........BUT........I can self isolate, work from home to get paid, get food easily and if I'm ill I have excellent health care, where as someone in Africa may not have the same luxuries.....just the face mask.....no hand washing facilities, no hospitals or way of self isolating.It's way too soon to crow about how well a country has done when there is so many unknowns with this situation, especially in countries where there is very low rates of people movement, which served to slow transmission rates.I am so glad that Morocco is a country that was lucky enough to have the right conditions to avoid a disaster, and also implemented an early and rigid lockdown, which many countries like the UK avoided so not to impact the ""economy"". The fall out from this for a country that may not be economically ""robust"" could cause more misery than Covid in the next year or two.....who knows.As a woman, it's hard, if not impossible, for me to say Morocco is more advanced (in some aspects) than my own country as LoveTafraoute said, as Morocco has a LONG, LONG way to go before there are true equal rights for women, a true democracy or press freedom (people still go ""missing"" for insulting the king) or welfare state or medical systems. I have also experienced the healthcare in Morocco....which is either non-existent (in rural communities) or only accessible for people with money.......a situation that is far from ""advanced"".Other things I have learnt:Not quite sure what ""Populism"" has to do with this thread.......Covid-19 for me has polarised politics, and phrases like ""populism"" is one of those that should now be consigned to ""old politics"", where phrases like that were used to put down opinion and create ""tribes"" which resulted in us being so busy screaming at the other tribe, insisting tribe A is more righteous than tribe B, that we missed the real bad guys becoming very rich and nasty at the expense of EVERYONE, while intolerance and inequality reigns!.......lets stay away from the tribal stuff....it's just a tool invented by the rich for the rich to control the poor/money."
"@KateWhat you described in your last paragraph is why I said populism is dangerous. It creates a ""them and us"" scenario and causes distraction from real and important issues.Forgive me, I am a lazy writer. What I meant by ""advanced"" was in Morocco's response to Covid. It was more forward thinking, recognised the threat, acted quickly and tried to protect it's people. It came across as a generic statement, but was not intended as such."

"The Lessons that I Learned:That Moroccan companies and airlines will do anything possible to keep your money unethically. It is all about them.They will:- lie (RAM refused to honor EU261)- not answer phones (RAM)- state their business is ""closed"" but post on social media for multiple days in a row (Travel Exploration).- not honor their guarantees (Travel Exploration Morocco)- refuse to refund you (RAM/Travel Exploration Morocco)The rest of the world is also dealing with COVID and impacts to their businesses, livelihoods, and salaries. Except Morocco. They just kept all the money paid to them and stopped communicating.#notimpressed"
Ninja what happened I thought you got your money back from RAM?Did it get reversed?
"Aren't Travel Exploration Morocco a US company?I will add that I am awaiting refunds from 3 different European airlines so it's not an issue exclusive to Morocco at all, but I can totally understand your frustration."
"@comicman I disputed the charge with my credit card and got my money back. I think it is still within the 60 days that RAM can fight it. Hoping nothing changes with the credit.@nibrika Travel Exploration is listed as a US -based company. But the owner does not live in the US, nor follow US recommendations.While I did have to wait for refunds from other airlines (Norwegian, Finnair, Ryanair, American, Lufthansa, CzechAir, SAS) - at least they acknowledged that I was due a refund. RAM just denies it - no matter what EU261 says."
OK.I thought you had received your refund free and clear.I am still waiting for Ryan Air to respond to my refund request.
"Not only for for ""the ones knowing Morocco as Travellers or living there"" but for the whole world. We all need to invest more in medicine instead of wars and military"
"Hi Guys.Hope all are doing Fine.Not only for Morocco..but anyway..interesting to read about the change..Yours,Olli.https:/…"
