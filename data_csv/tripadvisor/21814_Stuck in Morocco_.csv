"STUCK IN MOROCCO?  Hopefully most tourist visitors will by now have reached home on a repatriation flight.This thread is for those who haven’t been able to get a flight, are in Morocco with vehicles, or otherwise can’t or don’t want to leave the country at the moment."
"GET OUT NOW IF YOU CANMorocco is likely to be in lockdown for many months, so unless you are prepared for a long stay in the country you should get out now.The Moroccan government has said flights taking visitors out of Morocco will cease midnight Thursday (20 March). There are fears amongst those waiting for flights that the capacity is not enough to carry home all the stranded passengers. There’s no big reason why Morocco shouldn’t allow the flights to continue for a couple of days more and hopefully this will happen if it’s needed, but be aware that the UK is within days of closing its airspace to incoming flights.  There are likely many hundreds of owners of motorhomes, 4x4s, cars and motorbikes still in Morocco. If you have a vehicle the obvious exit routes are via the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla on the North African coast. The enclaves are sovereign Spanish territory and the ferry services to and from the Spanish mainland will continue in some form as this is the main way the enclaves are resupplied. Many UK motorhome and 4x4 owners who are holding ferry tickets to the mainland have successfully exited via the enclaves.  "
"IF YOU CAN’T GET OUTYou need to keep an eye on your entry dates into Morocco. Most visitors have an automatic entitlement to 90 days in Morocco. If you are likely to exceed that you need to visit a police station to extend your entitlement. If you are near Marrakech or Fez I would suggest you initially visit the Brigade Touristique (Tourist Police) stations. Marrakech BT is on Djemaa el Fna near the orange sellers, Fez is next to Bab Boujeloud.From the chat on Motorhomefun forum, many British motorhome owners are planning to stay in Morocco rather than jump into the virus maelstrom in Spain. Ditto for some 4x4 owners on HorizonsUnlimited forum.   Owners typically get six months entry for vehicles but check your temporary importation slip for the actual date. If you need to extend this, or if you get the chance to fly out leaving the vehicle behind on a temporary basis, you should visit a Douanes (customs) office. These are at all sea ports and airports, for example, Ouarzazate. "
"WHAT’S THE CURRENT VIRUS SITUATION?  If you are young, in good health, and a happy-go-lucky outlook, you might not be too worried about getting the virus, but older folk are at higher risk and this thread is primarily written for them.  Compared to other countries, Morocco *currently* has an extremely low rate of detected cases, with just 1.5 cases per million of population. This compares with 40 in the UK, 140 in France and Germany, 300 in Spain and 600 cases per million population in Italy. As of today, Morocco has five new cases making 49 in total, the majority of which involve Moroccans returning from Europe (Italy, Spain and France). There is thought to be little local transmission. Two deaths have occurred, both of elderly Moroccan citizens.   Despite all the government measures in place, I think you should assume there are more as-yet-undetected cases, that there WILL be local transmission, and that the declared infection rate will start to climb, possibly gently at first, then more steeply.There’s not likely to be much contact between returning ex-pat Moroccans and visitors, and I’ve not heard of a tourist being infected. Most motorhome owners and other long term visitors arrived in Morocco before all this kicked off so should be clear."
"LONGER TERM OUTLOOK  Whilst Morocco is to be applauded for its quick action in trying to contain the virus, the resulting low infection rates means there is no community resilience being formed (herd immunity to use an alternative expression). So even if the virus fades out in Morocco, unless a vaccine can be quickly developed and mass immunisation given, the outbreak could be restarted by a single ‘super spreader’ case coming in from another country the moment international travel restrictions are lifted.HOW LONG WILL THE LOCKDOWN LAST FOR?This is impossible to predict as it depends more than anything on infection progress in other countries. UK and USA are talking about the infection rate being “months” with its peak possibly in April, May and June, and then possibly tailing off in July and August. So probably a minimum of three months and possibly six or nine months. But the reality is nobody knows."
"WHERE TO STAY? If you are resident in Morocco with your own accommodation, food storage, cooking facilities and TV, it makes sense to stay where you are in a community you know. The suggestions on this thread aren’t really intended for residents. If you are a visitor staying in a hotel you should be aware that some of the larger tourist-oriented resort hotels are planning to close up totally, so you might need to find somewhere else. And at a more reasonable rate if you are going to be there long term. You might want to consider an apartment which at least means you can self-cater.If you have a motorhome/camper van, then camp sites are probably a fairly safe place to park up and chill out whilst maintaining social distancing.Although restaurants are generally closed, some hotel restaurants are (currently) being allowed to continue serving guests, similarly restaurants on camp sites such as Le Relais in Marrakech. Other restaurants are supplying food on a ‘take out’ basis.I had experience of being stuck in one place about ten years ago when there was a national transport strike. I was on my motorbike so naturally thought, “this won’t affect me,” until I needed fuel in Ouarzazate and found the resupply tankers hadn’t been running for days and there was no fuel to be had. So I spent nine days in Ouarzazate, really getting to know the place! I met up with some other bikers and this was my first taste of orange-flavoured vodka!   But then that was only for nine days, we could be talking three, six or even nine months before travel restrictions are lifted. So on one hand should you stay in a major city with access to reasonable healthcare? Or are you better off finding a more remote location with greater personal freedom and perhaps less danger of infection? This is a personal decision, I can only say what I would do…(to be continued...)"
"WHERE IN MOROCCO SHOULD BE AVOIDED? In a further update yesterday evening, another five cases were announced. Rabat-Kenitra is the most infected region with 14 confirmed cases, followed by Casablanca-Settat and Fez-Meknes with 12 each. Marrakech-Safi has five cases and Souss-Massa (Agadir/Taroudannt) four. There have also been cases around Agadir, Tanger/Tetouan, and Guelmim.   To put these figures into perspective, at the moment in London there’s 900 confirmed cases, whilst Milan in Italy has well over 10,000. The Moroccan numbers are so low the current chance of catching the virus is vanishingly small, but these figures could rapidly escalate in which case personally I would avoid all of the Atlantic Coast from Tanger down to Agadir. I would also avoid larger cities. The thought of being locked down in a strange city with empty streets and loads of restrictions doesn’t appeal to me. I would much rather be exploring in the open air, keeping my distance from others, and getting endorphins from exercise. So some gentle walks, hikes and treks in the mountains or desert or along the beaches.  The authorities are already trying to encourage people to stay indoors and it is possible there will shortly be a state of emergency announced and a curfew imposed in cities. You may only have a few days in which to move to a different location."
"SOME SUGGESTIONSIf you have your own transport it still should be possible to move around. I don't know the situation with buses, and understand that grand taxis might be limited to three passengers.As always in Morocco, be guided by weather forecasts. Unfortunately, after a glorious February and early March the weather has turned, with several days of showers forecast in the next two weeks for the north of the country down to Marrakech.  MERZOUGA: So right now I would head for the sunshine around the Erg Chebbi sand dunes near Merzouga (no virus cases reported). There’s a hundred or more hotels in the area, they will be hungry for business and you could probably get a really good deal for an extended stay. One hotel is even offering free accommodation, see https:/…Explore the lead/barite mines of M’fis, the rock engravings near Taouz, the ancient city of Sijilmassa, the ‘James Bond’ crater of Gara Medour, the underground canals (khetteras) of Jorf.SIDI IFNI: On the coast way below Agadir, this is a quiet seaside town that is tremendously popular with motorhome owners. I once arrived planning to stop two nights and stayed eleven. One of the walks you could undertake (starting an hour before low tide) is north along the beach to Legzira, about 12 km north. Even though bars might be closed, Hotel BellVue has an alcohol hatch service in the car park.TAFRAOUTE: My favourite place in Morocco and somewhere I could hole up for weeks. Lots of walking north of the town in the amazing Ameln Valley, lots of walking to the south around the painted rocks. Again, a favourite with motorhome owners and many formal campsites as well as semi-wild.IMLIL: trail head for Jebel Toubkal ascents, but also an area of great walks with some circular routes. See Imlil subforum for information.MIDDLE ATLAS: The area immediately south of Azrou has some amazing walks through the cedar forests and limestone karst scenery. Although in the Middle Atlas mountains these are mainly quite flat. A wonderland of volcanic cones, volcanic vents, wild monkeys, springs, lakes and wild flowers. You could set up a multi-day trek from Azrou south to Ain Leuh and then on to Zouiat Ifrane (east of M'rirt) which is situated under the edge of a calcified plateau with waterfalls cascading down. Five nice gites to stay at.MIDDLE ATLAS: Further to the north east is the Tazekka National Park near Taza, again it's an area of limestone karst and cedar trees._____________________________________I hope this thread helps, and if anyone else has some suggestions for somewhere to hole up long term please post. Some might prefer to stay in Marrakech or Fez in which case tips for spending the day would be useful."
"I would add that although restaurants are closed , many are selling meals to go. So it is an option for food you can bring back to your hotel."
"Some hotels are closing saying they've been told to do so by the police, though there's some suspicion this is an excuse to be able to close the hotel completely and lay the staff off. Anyway, whatever, one option in cities such as Marrakech, Fez and Casablanca is to rent an apartment via Airbnb which of course is unregulated, and is likely to have food storage and cooking facilities."
"Events have moved fast and the state of emergency has now been introduced effective 6pm tonight (Friday 20 March). There will then be restrictions on traffic and travel, so if you want to relocate somewhere else without encountering problems, today is the day.Once the state of emergency is in place you will still be allowed to go food shopping or visit the pharmacy but this will be within ""the perimeter of the place of residence."""
"The Moroccan government is responding to the increase in detected cases (currently 86) and is suspending all intercity bus services on midnight Tuesday 24 March. The buses need to have finished their journey by the deadline.Following the suspension of buses, traveling between cities will only be possible using trains or private vehicles. However, travellers will have to undergo checks from the authorities and provide justifications for their travel."
We are in the Dades Valley and long ago booked an apartment in Essaouira for next week. We heard about the travel restrictions on the news coming here this morning and have been told by others that we now can’t leave our riad indefinitely.. But I just read about bus and car travel until Tuesday and when we passed a checkpoint this morning the police didn’t even give us a second look. We’re now wondering if we’d able to drive to Essaouira tomorrow and find another apartment earlier. Does anyone have an idea about what the rules are for this kind of travel?
"Officially you need a derogation document countersigned by the local muqadem stating that you are out and about for a legitimate purpose. Download it from here:--…interieur.gov.ma/assets/files/attestation_c…I've been out feeding cats today, which are starving because of the shutdown of restaurants. I stuck to the back streets, but I glimpsed people walking along the main roads. Some looked as though they would not know what a download was even if one hit them full on. I honestly don't know. If you didn't get problems at checkpoints, maybe try to get to Essaouira asap, However, I'd try to get a legalised form for the journey, just in case. Your present accommodation providers should be able to help you. The form, by the way, needs to be printed on paper and stamped to be valid. Online forms filled in with the info are not accepted."
"Rules are being made up on the fly and those on the ground aren't yet fully in the know. Friends who were walking about in Zagora were stopped and told they needed a form but the policeman couldn't tell them how to get one! Things in Morocco are going to become more restrictive, you really won't be able to move if you leave it any later. So I would go for it now."
Thanks for this.
"Hi Trini2goYou might strike lucky. A French friend of a certain age is far braver than I am. She went out to feed cats blatantly and was caught by a cop and an official with a clipboard. She confessed she did not have a form. She was issued one on the spot, signed and stamped by the official. I'm going to be trying this ruse tomorrow. If I don't post any more, you'll know I'm in the dungeons. If I get a paper to let me out for the cats, I'll come back onto the board, of course. This might be a local initiative just in El Jadida as Moroccans here on my social media pages are saying still that you need to see the muqadem. We shall see,Edited: 5:18 pm, March 21, 2020 "
"Hi SB,You’ll probably know that the rules were changed again this evening, and as of midnight tonight no one is allowed to drive at all; the Tuesday deadline doesn’t hold anymore."
HiI've been remiss. I didn't know. I have been having a lazy evening watching films with Jack Daniels.Thank you for the information.

"""""benefitting from exit facilities"""" simply means that you won't get fined for having stayed for more than 90 days. The sense of the announcement is that you are not subject to normal (Moroccan) visa restrictions when you leave for home or another country Morocco allows departures to. This is when the crisis is over, of course and the borders are gradually reopened."
"This might not help much seeing as people can't change region, but this website shows the location of the cases (currently 134) around the country, http://www.covidmaroc.ma/Pages/AccueilAR.aspxThe busy littoral (coastal plain) is worse affected with (north to south) Tanger-Tetouan (8), Kenitra-Sale-Rabat (32), Casa-Settat (34), and then Souss-Massa (Agadir, Taroudannt 6) having 60% of the cases, followed by Fez-Meknes (29). Marrakech is starting to rise (15). My top three suggestions in response #7 for places to 'shelter in place' were Merzouga (within Draa-Tafilalet with 1 reported case), Sidi Ifni (within Guelmim-Oued Noun with 1 case), and Tafraoute (no cases)."
"Report this morning from friends who are with a 4x4 Defender in Zagora, “Today the restrictions have started. Only 4 permits allowed for people to go into town. The campsite will get us any supplies we need. We can walk in the palmerie but not on the road and not in the town. The head man was here this morning to tell us of new regime.”From Ouarzazate, “We are ""stuck"" in campsite at Ouarzazate following the lockdown last night which was quite dramatic here as the police turned up, closed the campsite restaurant and informed all the campervanners to go eat in their campervans: as we've [only] a rooftop tent on our Hilux we were allowed to stay!”And in Imsouane (coast below Essaouira), “Seems to be different applications of the rules in different areas. Officially you need a permit to move around. Here at the site I'm on today people came and went, two vehicles left completely, and two went out for the day without bother. Walking in and out to the shop isn't a problem either. Friends in Mhamid aren't allowed to leave the campsite and the staff will do shopping for them. At the sites in Sidi Ifni the police visited and issued everyone permits. That's not happened here but some people went down to the police station to get them. They are supposed to be for going to the shop, work or medical treatment so I'm not sure how they would work for travelling to another location.”"
"I got my permit today, They are obtained (in El Jadida) from the ""Annexe Administrative"" for the area one resides in or is stuck in. A photocopy of the passport is needed. I had a sponsor (as I feed the cats) and a copy of their ID card was required also. We didn't have the photocopy so the muqadem came to my house to complete the paperwork and take the copies away once we'd obtained them. The office was really busy but they were only letting a few people in at a time and others waited outside. Obviously I was out and about without a permit at first. No one challenged me. Loads of people were out too, unlike yesterday which was much quieter. I cannot imagine that they all had permits. I surmise that people were taking advantage of the grace period before 6pm tonight when swingeing fines will be imposed for people without permits or imprisonment."
"Useful, thanks. Anyone in Marrakech, Fez, Merzouga?"

"There is currently a queue of motorhomes, said to be 5km long, on the side of the road in Fnediq leading to Bab Sebta, the Moroccan border with Spanish Ceuta. One owner estimates there are 500 vehicles with 1,000 people waiting in line."
I've been sent a report that the Moroccan army are patrolling the desert and sending any off roaders who are self isolating into campsites.
"The lockdown is getting stricter. People were being checked in Azemmour today. Friends of mine said that there were controls even in the Medina. Even though I have a permit for ""Other imperative reason"" to go out - it's to feed the cats - I was turned back a short while ago from going to El Jadida town centre, ""Off limits"". I have to just feed in my area. Daytime, just when I don't want to go as there will be people around and the cats will be hiding, ""will be alright"". I saw a video today of people being beaten by security forces for being out without permits on a WhatsApp status. Unfortunately the city was not mentioned.Edited: 6:15 pm, March 24, 2020 "
"Posted last night by the German Ambassador to RabatTANGER MED PARKING OPEN FOR CAMPERSMoroccan authorities have just opened the parking lot at Tangier Med ferry port as a stand for campers.  There are sanitary facilities and the supply is guaranteed. We strongly advise all campers who are currently around Ceuta to check this offer. We are continuing to work on a European solution for the exit of stranded campers. The orders of the Moroccan security forces must in any case be followed.Statement from SPANISH governmentThe Spanish government has announced it has ordered the Ceuta and Melilla borders to be closed and motorhomes can no longer pass, summarised below...The government has temporarily closed the land posts authorised for entry and departure from Spain through the cities of Ceuta and Melilla. Only Spanish citizens and residents of Spain, residents of other EU countries or countries of the Schengen area who go to their countries of residence may enter Spain...I'm not sure whether British motorhomers are deemed not to be part of the EU anymore and therefore are being blocked? Otherwise the situation doesn't make sense.Edited: 3:58 am, March 25, 2020 "
"And from the British Embassy in Rabat... Thanks to the French Ambassador @AmbaFranceMaroc and the Wali of Tangier ... Tangier Med will open its car park to the campervans queuing near Ceuta. There is water, showers, toilets and electricity there. Another good, flexible and sensible response from the Moroccan authorities!"
"According to the Swiss Ambassador to Rabat, additional camper van parking sites are being set up at Tanger Ville Port and Oued Laou (north east of Chefchaouen). Flights out of Morocco are still being organised on a sporadic basis, one left today from Casablanca to Zürich."
"In addition to the British motorhomes, a British 4x4 owner currently on the Atlantic coast says the French authorities reckon there's 5,000 French motorhomes still in Morocco. Plus Dutch, German, Spanish..."
"Most of the motorhomes have now moved to the park near Tanger Med. This is actually at Ksar es Seghir, about 5km from the port, there's two blocks of, fresh water taps and a cassette dumping spot. Electricity is being installed. There's a temporary shop/market stall area. The French Embassy says a medical team will be on site and that negotiations are taking place for repatriation by ferry to Sète in southern France.French camping car website: https:/…contSome motorhome owners on the UK Motorhomefun forum are at or close to the northern ports but many others are still elsewhere in Morocco, unable to move. Some campsites are only allowing in motorhomes that arrived in Morocco before February 20 and where the owners are not showing signs of illness."
**two blocks of portacabins
"We are in a motorhome stuck in the site ~5km from Tanger Med. Whilst the site is being prepared and does have a basic shop with groceries this is a really awful place to be. There are motorways on all sides of the car park. You are absolutely not allowed to leave, I cannot stress more that this far we are prisoners on this site. Despite pushing all day for papers to go to the bank we are constantly fobbed off. We are constantly asked for our passports and details with no plausible explanation as to why. The army is patrolling the site. They are there to stop you getting out NOT to stop people getting in. Do not come here unless you are absolutely desperate for food and water."
There are 3 taps for 2000+ people. If the virus comes here hundreds of elderly motorhomers are likely to die.We are desperately hoping the French consulate will help get a ferry organised to Sete in France but it is a long shot. I do know that the Moroccans will not want a load of motorhomers deaths.
I've seen on forums that people are not impressed with the efforts of the British Embassy and all I can say is that Tom Reilly and his team have been working their collective asses off in the last three weeks on behalf of British citizens. Their lack of success with the Spanish port closures is down to the Spanish government decisions. All I can say is that they've not given up.I would think it will take half a dozen ferry trips to move all the French motorhomes still in Morocco to Sète and hope this becomes a possibility.I've not heard of any cases of the virus amongst the motorhome community. Let's hope it stays like that.
"Tim, our issue with Tom Reilly is not his lack of success but purely his complete lack of communication with people that are at their wits end as a result of the advice he gave. He has literally dumped us here after his own advice went belly up. When he told us to come to Ceuta, the Spanish government had already issued the document to say Ceuta would be closed."
"I can see what you mean on the communications front—a daily tweet, even if it's to say nothing much has changed, would at least reassure you that you've not been forgotten.The Embassy gave you advice in good faith. From my reading of the Spanish government document, they are not acting in accordance with what was agreed and have 'folded' under pressure from the alcalde of Ceuta who didn't want hundreds of motorhomes driving through during lockdown. In the meantime I suggest you organise yourselves on the Ksar es Seghir site, decide on a spokesperson and insist on a meeting with whomever is controlling the site to deal with your immediate issues.The positive aspect is that Morocco is currently safer than many parts of Spain."
"REGISTER WITH BRITISH EMBASSYWith airspace and ports closed, there are currently no options for evacuation, however it's important you stay in touch with the Embassy so you can be informed if the situation changes.Irrespective of whether or not you plan to stay in Morocco or would like to leave, all British citizens now in Morocco (apart from those normally resident here) should register with the British Embassy as requested by Tom Reilly, the British Ambassador.

"Unconfirmed rumour that Sète ferry is running, would appreciate confirmation if this is so. The price I heard was €600 for motorhome which is a bit of an uplift on the normal price, but then it's running empty on one leg."
"BRITISH EMBASSY: a series of tweets today from @TSAReilly, British Ambassador...The Moroccan state of emergency will remain in force until 20 April. At the moment, there are no plans to bring in further flights. We are aware that some British tourists remain in Morocco. You have contacted the Embassy, so we know who and where you are. But because airspace & ports are closed, we have no good options for evacuating you. Our advice, therefore, in common with all other Embassies in Morocco, is to stay where you are. Remain in contact with the Embassy. Tell us if you do decide to move. If we are able to bring in a flight, we will need to be able to contact you. I understand that this is a very unpleasant situation to be in. I understand you are stressed and worried. But being rude to my staff is not going to help anyone, nor will it get you home any quicker.______________________________________________GERMAN EMBASSY: Ferry to FranceThe EU delegation and the French Foreign Ministry are working intensively on the implementation of a ferry solution from Tanger-Med to France.

"Tanger Med to Sète (France) ferry looks like it's a reality for at least some of the motorhomes and 4x4s currently stuck as Ksar-es-Seghir.There will be two voyages, one tomorrow (Sunday) and another on Thursday. The ferry can take about 200 motorhomes. Tickets will be €1200 instead of the normal €500. The ships name is Napolis and is operated by Balearia. Police will allow for people to leave and buy tickets which are available to any nationality in the carpark in Tangier Med. The tickets are available NOW to purchase before 1800 hours from the location below. GPS: N35 51 29.7 W5 32 00.5Google maps: https://maps.app.goo.gl/RpScWDibU413wvS1A"
"Early indications from negotiations between the French and UK governments are that those who choose to take the ferry to Sete will be allowed to travel across France to Calais, where a ferry will be available to take them across the Channel back to the UK.Latest from the Embassy is that the the Honnory Consel is on his way to the port to help brits at Tangier Med. There is limited availability on this boat and the advice for those that are not already at Tangier Med is to stay where you are and await further advice. The embassy does not know what are the plans for those that choose to stay in the carpark at Tanger Med but the Moroccans will not forcibly remove them until a better solution for them is found."
"Unhappy campers in Tanger Med. Normal Tanger-Sète ferry price starts from €500, the cost of these special ferries including cabin can be over €1,500. But the conditions at Tanger Med car park are such that people are swallowing hard and paying up."
Per person?
"Newspaper reports, multiple sources: Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, will shortly announce plans for commercial and charter flights to repatriate up to one million Britons stranded abroad as officials admitted the RAF might need to step in."
More grandstanding by the government and little action. As if the RAF has more planes than the grounded fleets of virtually all of the world's airlines.This sort of help should have been available many days ago if not longer.
"From response #54: ""The embassy does not know what are the plans for those that choose to stay in the carpark at Tanger Med but the Moroccans will not forcibly remove them until a better solution for them is found.""Despite the statement above, the reverse seems to be the case and in the video linked below the person speaking says owners not taking up the Sète ferry offer are being asked to leave and find a more permanent solution elsewhere. This is because the Ksar-es-Seghir parking is being positioned as a transit camp and other owners further down the country will be invited to move up to it as other ferries are organised.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr2wmdEbArwComment in the last couple of minutes from Ian Fearn, ""I am hopefully just about to get on this ferry. We are told this camp will close ASAP. There are still 30-40 vans clearly not leaving today.""Edited: 11:10 am, March 29, 2020 "
"Hi Tim, Ian Fearn here, we are now on the boat but it hasn’t left yet. The boat is nice, well run and incredibly clean. I know the price is high but I am not in a position to complain."
"We were told the Moroccans DO want to close this camp. It must be costing them a fortune financially and in general resources. Personally I would rather they piled the cash and efforts into their own people at this challenging time.My advice to you is, contact the embassy and get permission to travel to the tanger med car park ONLY if you are prepared to pay the 1400 euros for the ferry to Sete. The site is perfectly adequate for a few days wait. Just do what your told by the officials, there is no arguing to be done."
"Thanks Ian, bon voyage."
"Message from James Wix, UK Foreign Office warden, ""Please can anyone with a camper van or motor home that still wants to leave Morocco get in contact with me,"" telephone/whatsapp +212 658-254166"
"Hi @Big DorisI asked upthread but no one replied. The 1500 euro cost. Is it per motorhome including all the people in it, per cabin, per person or what? Just to help others out who might want to take the plunge."
"The price is based on the vehicle length, number travelling and if you want a cabin. We paid 1400euros for a 5m van, 2 people and a cabin.I think it’s 100euro extra per extra meter length over 6m."
Many thanks.
"The Moroccan government has previous stated several times that additional restrictions may be introduced once the number of detected cases exceeds 500, which it did this morning. As restrictions tend to be introduced without notice it would be wise for all remaining visitors to think through if there's anything you could usefully do right now in preparation for the next few weeks.As predicted in previous posts, the worst affected areas are the busy commercial coast and coastal plains, with half the cases. Of these the region from El Jadida - Casablanca is the worst affected with 149 cases, then Rabat - Kenitra - Moulay Bousselham with 88."
"Just to reassure anyone who is in the El Jadida area or the city itself. There has been one confirmed case in El Jadida and that was announced overnight. Of course there will be many more undetected cases floating around but I think it's alarmist and incorrect to say that the El Jadida-Casablanca area is worst affected. Casablanca and the suburbs are the worst affected area. I don't have a breakdown of where in the El Jadida/Casablanca conurbation (if we can even call it that) the cases have been identified but it's reliable news that there is, so far, just one case in the city itself. None has been reported in Azemmour except for a false alarm 2 weeks ago."
"Tim, do you have a sense of the types of measures that might be put in place? We feel safe here in the southeast as the only guests in a welcoming riad and in touch with the local officials. But I did take note when Spain closed all of its accommodation to non-residents."
"No firm sense. The cases are tending to be concentrated in major cities and in the local population. I'm only aware of one tourist-type person who's in hospital and he's dual nationality, so probably was visiting relatives. The Minister of Health has been quoted explaining that parties and family gatherings, along with group travels are some of the major factors behind the spread of the virus in Morocco. So I would imagine the focus will be on that.The number of cases is now over 550 and I would expect an announcement soon if one is coming."
"""The Minister of Health has been quoted explaining that parties and family gatherings""And he's absolutely right. I just saw a WhatsApp status of a friend's maid. It was a birthday party for her 5 year old daughter. A load of women crammed in a room with their kids. This needs to be tackled.The other thing is the allegedly essential professions. My next door neighbour is having his villa done up. The decorators' car has an exemption form saying that they are members of en essential profession and are allowed to circulate freely.I don't think that most people are going to realise exactly what's going on until people are dying around them. And then it will be too late. Oh yes, they're staying in more, but in other respects they are bringing doom upon themselves."

"Alcohol sales banned from midnight tonight in Marrakech-Safi region and also Casablanca. This might get overturned as it was a local decision. If they are open tomorrow, buy what you need for weeks. They will close anyway in a couple of weeks as Ramadan approaches.Declared cases are now over 600."
"I have seen a form rescinding the alcohol ban. And it started today at 00.01am. Alcohol was banned in Marrakech today and all offies were closed. Allegedly the alcohol shops will be open tomorrow. I don't think they even shut on the coast, just in Marrakech due to some crazy order by an official who had no power to ban anything,"
"The first ferry load of French, UK and other motorhomes and 4x4s arrived in Sète (southern France) yesterday, those who were on the ship said it was very good and the staff exceptional. French port officials kind and compassionate, issued everyone with official paperwork to travel through France. Some are now about to land in England, apparently cross-channel ferries are empty and inexpensive compared to the Tunnel.The UK embassy have had confirmation, from the ferry company, that as long as your vehicle has the correct EU registration (or UK or Swiss as mentioned in the Ferry company's announcement) you can buy a ticket and board the ferry. The ferry is not restricted to just camper vans. 4X4 vehicles were able to board on the Sunday sailing. But no foot passengers, motorcycles and cars.Those planning to travel for tomorrow's ferry (check times, might be 0800 rather than 1600), should contact the UK embassy which is issuing a letter with permission to travel to get the Ferry. To get your letter from the embassy you can WhatsApp Ahad Miah at +212 6 66 29 34 44 or email him Ahad.miah@homeoffice.gov.ukYou should also have the Moroccan Government form that allows you to be outside of your place of confinement. This needs to be stamped by the local authorities. The form is in Arabic. The last box is for travel for another reason. Tick this box and write that you are travelling to catch the ferry boat from Tanger Med."
"Alcohol is supposedly being bought in Marrakech today by expats (and presumably by Moroccans). Obviously, as I'm not there, this isn't firsthand information, but it looks like the ban was rescinded as quickly as it was announced. I already saw an announcement yesterday of a climbdown. Apparently the official ""banning"" the sales had no power to do so and the shops were only closed yesterday for the day.As I said upthread, offies didn't even close in Casablanca or El Jadida. I might pop down to the offie here myself today to get supplies, just in case. Of course, I hope they're open!Edited: 8:14 am, April 01, 2020 "
"This thread was always for visitors who were stuck in Morocco and trying to get flights or ferries. Those who are still in Morocco should by now be watching the various Twitter, Facebook and Whatsapp groups and specific Internet forums, so this thread will become superfluous. I think I've done all I can on this here and will now continue on the other media. Any residents who feel like chatting about the current situation could usefully start a thread dedicated to that subject."
"Righty-ho.Post #73 by TimCullis""Alcohol sales banned from midnight tonight in Marrakech-Safi region and also Casablanca. This might get overturned as it was a local decision.""Do what I say, not what I do, is that it? I still haven't looked at the offies here. Anyone who's stuck and can get out shopping might try having a look too as well as residents and saying what they find.I'm glad many of the people stuck with motorhomes got out. In the meantime, others might like information about a rapidly changing situation and what they can and can't do and buy."
"There's one last chance to get on a flight next week that the Foreign Office is organising. If people want to fly out, they need to contact the British Embassy by email at consular support with their location in Morocco. Unlike the repatriation flights organised by many other countries which were free, it will be ""commercial rates"". This will be the last UK flight ever until the borders are reopened, according to the notification I received. I really don't know more than that. It leaves many questions unanswered. It's ""a flight"". I can't imagine everyone will get on. If people can't pay, what do they do? Although they might try getting on any flight organised by the Germans as they have been letting Brits on their flights for free (according to testimonies in the newspapers) and taking them as far as Germany and this from several countries. Good luck.Edited: 11:00 am, April 02, 2020 "
"And on a completely different note, the off licences are open! So if you're stuck, you can drown your sorrows. Moroccans and foreigners were happily stocking up today."
"Further to post #79.The final flight for UK nationals stuck in Morocco will leave from Casablanca at 3pm next Tuesday for Stansted. No dual nationals will be let on, nor non-UK passport holders. To be able to book, a code from the Embassy is required. It will cost £475 per person. One hold bag of 20kg and a cabin bag are allowed per passenger."
there is another repatriation flight for UK passport holders from Morocco on Fridaycheck the Twitter of the British Ambassador for details: https://twitter.com/TSAReillyor British Embassy on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ukinmorocco/
"For those still stuck and who might not read the Moroccan press, please be aware of this:--Coronavirus: Morocco - Night curfew during the month of Ramadan ... from 7pm to 5am, travel on foot or by car is prohibited except for people working in vital and essential sectors. Emergency travel permits issued by local authorities and travel certificates submitted by the public and private sectors will not be valid during the ""night curfew""."
"One more UK repatriation flight will leave this Saturday, this is apparently the last one - details here https://twitter.com/UKinMoroccoCost is GBP477 which is obviously expensive but I assume the flights are arriving emptyEdited: 8:33 am, April 29, 2020 "
"They keep announcing ""the last one"" so who knows? I'm not denigrating the Ambassador, but the UK government's response to stranded Britons has been a scandalous shambles. When Brits have to beg for places on German planes and get taken to Germany for free to make their way home from there yet pay inflated prices for UK-provided repatriation flights, something is wrong. The Grauniad also reported as well that a political decision had been taken not to use allocated EU funds for repatriation flights unlike Germany which is how they got so many people back so cheaply.Edited: 10:20 am, April 29, 2020 "
You are right that the UK Government and their representative in Morocco.........let's call him Tom have been pathetic in their response.Just as an example is this FAQ page from the French Embassy https://ma.ambafrance.org/Coronavirus-au-Mar…All we get is a few tweets about family matters and some retweets from other sources that actually have useful information
Im guessing there are vastly higher numbers of French citizens still in Morocco than any other country (in fact I wouldnt be surprised if there was more French than all other countries combined) so its only normal to see that kind of info.Unrealistic to expect the same for the relatively small amount of Brits who are still stuck in Morocco - from what Ive seen the Embassy have done a decent job of keeping people updated on the situation via social media and in fact I noted many comments from several different nationalities thanking the British Embassy for the info as their own embassies had provided little to no info
"Yes, I want to make it perfectly clear that as I said, I wasn't criticising the ambassador and his staff who were working under financial constraints caused partly by the unnecessary policy of austerity and having to deal with political decisions that have hampered their ability to do more."
I don't see that the amount of information you make available is dependent on the number of people you are making it available to.
"@Peter W. @TSAReilly is indeed the personal twitter account of the ambassador, you are better served following the embassy account at https://twitter.com/UKinMorocco (which @nibrika gave a few posts earlier).As you will read there's another flight out on 2 May. So far the embassy has helped coordinate more than 50 flights carrying more than 8,000 British nationals. The embassy staff have managed this with just basic IT systems (email and spreadsheets) as there's no pre-prepared software systems to help with this. And in the meantime the normal work of the embassy carries on.Yes, I can see it's been spotty in places. Unfortunately human nature seems more inclined to moan about problems than applaud hard work.In the meantime, can we assume you are currently stuck in Morocco? Whereabouts are you and is there anything that anyone can help with?"
"Thanks for that offer Tim and for all information you have posted in the past that has helped us travel through Morocco.We are stuck in our motorhome in Zagora,But it's a good site and we are a lot better off than others. Still hoping to get out before the heat of the Summer."
"There is supposedly going to be a major heatwave in most of Morocco this weekend, so you might not miss some of the heat. I got a severe weather warning from the Meteo. I really don't know how to post it here."
"@John S: are you in Camping Oasis Palmeraie?Next Wednesday/Thursday is forecast to be hot in Zagora. If you are in one of the oasis campsites, then at least you might have some shade. In summer months I use a wet towel and battery-operated fan to cool down during sticky nights.Exit via Spain looks questionable for six or more weeks, see https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-04-2…Spanish citizens and foreigners with green residencia card are allowed to enter the country on land borders, but the ferries from Morocco are currently freight only."

"Ferries to Sète (France) and Genoa (Italy) are still running, the next ferries are 12th and 19th May, with more in June. Register at https:/…rapatriements-maroc.htmlContact your embassy with a copy of the booking confirmation and they should provide authorisation to travel to the ferry."
"Hi Tim,Is your information from the internal document circulating from the Ministry of health? I haven’t seen anything officially announced in the Francophone media. In the meantime, a Moroccan Canadian friend Alerted me to the fact that Royal Air Maroc is selling tickets Casablanca-Montreal starting June 1. Air Canada also lists tickets from June 1. I couldn’t tell whether they know something that the government has not publicly announced, or whether they’re just speculating."
"It was a document stored on the maghrebnews web server. The government has said more information is to be announced on 18 May ahead of the end of the current phase on 20 May. I heard that flights are also said to be available from Air France from 1 June which of course is much earlier than the dates given above. Unless these are repatriation only (i.e. not bringing people into the country). There are currently no firm plans to repatriate the estimated 27,000 Moroccan citizens stuck in other countries.Edited: 6:31 am, May 08, 2020 "
officially Moroccan airspace is closed until May31st but this might be extended - so technically airlines can sell flights for June eventhough they have no idea if airspace will be reopened by then
"Although the title of this is encouraging (SPAIN: BOATS MAY RESUME JUNE), there's actually nothing in the text that reflects this: https:/…68453.html I am monitoring the Spanish press but haven't seen anything yet about ferries.English translation: Spain: boat trips may resume in JuneMay 6, 2020Shipping companies operating in the Strait of Gibraltar are severely affected by the consequences of covid-19. Passenger traffic could resume in June, not before.The return to normal of the activities of the shipping companies operating in the Strait of Gibraltar remains uncertain, in particular the resumption of normal passenger traffic between the two shores. The boarding of people with urgent travel needs is authorized upon presentation of an authorization granted by the administration of Sebta.The government has announced recovery plans for maritime traffic, reports Ceutatv.com . If nothing particular changes in this sector until May 10, the situation will remain unchanged, as it has been since the entry into force of the state of emergency. The transport of goods to supply the population continues, despite announcements of a resumption of all traffic. The situation is identical in Tangier, because the Moroccan borders remain closed. A trend that seems to adopt the government of Ceuta, which has expressed its desire to keep the borders closed to effectively counter the virus.The possibility of gradually recovering the transit of people between Algeciras and Sebta would be definitively open, even if the government's trend is to reduce capacity. Ships that provide this service are also affected. Companies are considering the possibility of resuming all departures to transport a much smaller number of passengers and vehicles, regardless of the price.(Sebta is the Arabic name for Ceuta. How you are expected to get to Ceuta is another matter.)"
Oh Tim if only it was all so easy to get onto those boats. I know many people who have registered but I am not aware of anyone who has then booked a ticket.Even with a ticket the Embassy cannot provide authorisation to travel.............that comes from the Interior Ministry and they seem to be holding back on travel permits.I'm quite happy to be proved wrong and I think many French are moving because their Embassy sorted out the boats.Not helpful to raise false hopes........................like the UK Ambadassor positively tweeting that tickets are on sale to UK citizens.....tell me where Tom ....tell me where
"There are definitely U.K. people who have successfully used the Sète ferries, both motorhomes and 4x4s. The U.K. embassy in Rabat provided transit papers."
"My message was that from Zagora it is proving more complicated to get transit papers than along the coast,say from Agadir or Tiznit. It seems more relaxed over thereHere they will not accept any requests from the Embassy and it has to come directly from the Ministry of the Interior.I know that people have already got out to from Tanger to Sete. I am asking where and when these tickets for boats on the 12th and 19th will be on sale for UK citizens as Tom proudly tweeted................cos how can I say this politely...............I don't think it is true.And while him and his daughter proudly reach the snowline on Everest.......we have an 80 year old UK couple in a motorhome suffering in the desert heat."
"Tickets for the ferries are already available, you book the ferry using the link I provided above, https:/…rapatriements-maroc.htmlOr at the normal site URL of www.gnv.itMark White (aka 'Warden' on Horizons Unlimited) is British and has booked on the ferry on the 12th. He is in Imsouanne (north of Agadir) which I agree is easier to get to Tanger from. I have messaged you with details how you can get in touch with him to pick his brains.Tony J and Jan (also on Horizons Unlimited) are in the campsite just to the north of you (Camping Oasis Palmeraie) in a Defender. They want to return via Spain so probably won't move. However also on that site is Tony G and partner in a Mercedes van. I don't have Tony G's phone number but have messaged you with Tony J's phone so you can get in touch (or see whether the police will allow you to walk the 900m between sites).Edited: 4:09 pm, May 08, 2020 "
"Tim I don't want to be a pain here BUT.......................the site is just to show an interest in booking a boat.Then I understand GNV get in touch with you depending on (well secret things that we know nothing about) probably first French citizens as the French organised the boats and then.....well whoever has the best Embassy links/pressures with GNV.There is nothing until June 1 on GNV main site and none of those boat have permission to land, as yet So it is unhelpful, to say the least for UK Embassy to publicly state that tickets are available on either of those sites for UK citizens to buy.It look good in the publicity but dare I suggest that we should not be promoting it here as a fantastic UK solution.............it isn'tThanks for the other information and contacts..........................much appreciatedEdited: 5:34 pm, May 08, 2020 "
"If you read my response #96 you will see I am not promoting the ferries as a fantastic UK solution, I am no longer actively monitoring the UK Embassy twitter or other feeds as the information is so sporadic and uncoordinated.I appreciate the frustration with the British Embassy but you have to understand they are not in control of any of the ferries or airlines, they are merely trying to let people know about options. I do feel, however, there should be a better way to do this other than sporadic tweets. After all this is over, the Foreign Office would do well to review how it handles other emergency situations in future where thousands of British citizens need to be coordinated.I have not heard of anything to suggest that French citizens would be given preference on the GNV ferries. The company is, in any case, Italian. The reason for the 'booking interest' form is so they can check beforehand that you meet the requirements in terms of EU registered vehicles and passengers. I'd suggest you register your interest and see what the result is. In the meantime, contact Warden on HUBB and ask about his experience in successfully purchasing tickets for the next ferry.However... having written all of the above I checked the twitter feed for @UKinMorocco ( https://twitter.com/UKinMorocco ) and there's a comment from one person that the ferries might now be cancelled.Edited: 4:00 am, May 09, 2020 "
"The British Embassy is attempting to coordinate non-freight vehicle travel (i.e. motorhomes, 4x4s, cars) as a one-off exercise on a ferry from Tanger Med to Algeciras on Thursday 14 May at 1500 hrs. The timing seems unrealistically tight as travel documents have to be obtained first, but if you have not already been contacted by the British Embassy it might be worthwhile speaking to them."
"We got papers to travel for the Sete ferry on the 19th but then heard that the Embassy was organising an Algeciras ferry for the 14th.Unfortunately this has been cancelled until at least Monday because of the weather. So good for them. Unfortunately in another Embassy cock up they have told UK motorhomes to travel to Tanger Med, which is completely closed. The previous stop over in Ksar el Sguir has been taken down so there is NO WHERE for all these motorhomes to stay while waiting for the boat. It's a bit like the ""everyone go to Ceuta"" story which...........well we all know about that. So go back and stay on one of the motorhome services until at least Monday is their best option.I believe they have ""a man "" in Tanger who could have told them everywhere was closed. But they still told all UK motorhomers to go to Tanger Med.............did I mention it is closed.I have to remember these people are not helping me out as a favour (as many Moroccans have done) it is actually their job, which they are paid to do.Some good work done.................but also some pathetic piss poor planning"
"So where are you now, John? The problem is, on Friday Spain is to introduce a mandatory quarantine of 14 days on all arrivals from other countries, which I guess is why the ferry was organised in a panic for Thursday. But the forecast for Tarifa on Thursday is for 35km wind and thnderstorms.https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-05-1…Edited: 4:25 pm, May 13, 2020 "
We were told to go to Moulay Bousselham but everytime we have tried to get off the motorway to get food............Larache and Kenitra we have been sent back...........so not going that far to be turned back again.Now at services at Asilah and just stopping where we can until Sunday.....................trying to suggest to the Embassy (if anyone has any influence) that we cannot leave here at 5am for Tanger Med......why not put the boat back until the afternoon allowing those from Moulay and further to arrive OR reopen the overspill place at Ksar el Sguir for everyone to collect for Monday morning.No facilities but extensive parking.........simples.I presume (dangerous) that they have taken into account the Spanish quarantine.................do you think travelling through in a motorhome can be counted as self isolation
"You are about 90 minutes from Tanger Med, so good position. I'd like to think the Spanish will be sensible and realise that you are coming from a country that has hardly any infection compared to Spain. No good reason for not letting you travel through to France. Good luck. Please let us know if anything changes.Edited: 12:07 pm, May 14, 2020 "
"There are UK citizens scattered in services stations and campsites much further away than us.The boat is planned for 9am so at least arrival by 7am if not earlier.....and there is a curfew until 5 am I believe. Perhaps it cannot leave later because of tides or perhaps because no one has thought it would be a good idea There will be the madness of tickets and places and probably a lot of French who have arrived for the 19th boat to Sete also trying to get tickets.......so chaos at Tanger Med.And on Sunday UK motoromes who have moved closer parking wild on the way to the port. I am sympathetic to people trying hard but you do think they would have learnt about the movement of people from the Ceuta debacle.Anyway thanks for the info and I'll let you know how we get on......................hasta luegoEdited: 12:33 pm, May 14, 2020 "
The Spanish are now said to be organising a ferry from Tanger Med to Malaga on 22 May for Spanish nationals and residents only. There may be others later. This will involve a strict 14 day quarantine for all arrivals.
"@John S: It seems the arrangements with Intershipping for your ferry to Algeciras on Monday have fallen through, however a different ferry has now been pencilled in going to Málaga on Thursday 21 May. 250€ per campervan, €75 per passenger.Clearly there's a lot of things going on in the background that are making arrangements difficult to organise."
Luckily after several nights on motorway services we are now in Moulay Bousselham and no trouble turning off the motorway.So we can now wait comfortably for boat information.Hmm Malaga now...............well we'll see what happens.But if it were me I wouldn't have a boat to Malaga for UK and a boat to Malaga for Spanish the day after.Sounds like planned chaos at the port to me.But anyway as I say the sun is shining and there's not that oppressive heat as in Zagora...............so all is good............Hamdulla
"According to the British Ambassador (a tweet from a couple of minutes ago), the Thursday ferry to Málaga is still on."
Apparently it's just been announced that the ferry on Thursday has been confirmed
Good luck!! I hope you finally make it :-) Have a party on the boat on us :-) Let us know how it goes.
"More than 120 bookings for the tomorrow's ferry to Málaga, space for more than another 50 vehicles still left. Contact your national Embassy in Morocco for details and to arrange travel permits.For those without vehicles... According to a tweet from the British Ambassador, ""There’s been a sudden flurry of British nationals wishing to leave Morocco. We’ve organised 55 flights & are not planning any more.

Hope everything will end soon in the whole world.
Everything? LOL but I understand what you mean. And i hope so too.
"More than 500 people were able to leave Morocco yesterday (26 May) on the ferry to Séte but there are still many motorhome owners stuck in the southern part of the country who have been unable to move further north. Many without vehicles are still unable to leave—the British Embassy appears unwilling or unable to help those with UK residence permits who are non-UK citizens or dual Moroccan/UK nationality return to their country of residence. Similar situation with the French Embassy.Similarly, there are an estimated 35,000 Moroccan citizens stranded elsewhere that have been unable to return to Morocco."
"The 'La Méridionale' ferry from Tanger Med to Marseille left as planned today with many motorhomes, mainly French owners, on board. It looks like arrangements are now less subject to cancellation than before."
"Two more flights are being organised from Casablanca to the UK on Friday 5 June. Cost £490.Email morocco.britishsupport@fco.gov.uk if you would like to be included with the following details for each in your party...full name, date and place of birth, passport number and current location in #Morocco. If you are not a British national, but have a long-term visa or leave to remain, please note this in your email."
The first 100 Moroccans stranded abroad were returned yesterday from Algeria and landed at Oujda in Oriental Morocco. They will be quarantined (or more accurately novemtined) for nine days at the largely deserted seaside apartment blocks in nearby Saïdia. 600 in total are to be returned from Algeria.
I now know what it's like to be a monk after several weeks of peace tranquillity and no music.
"The State of Emergency will be extended until 10 July. The government hopes to gradually ease the lockdown restrictions and some more details may be provided tomorrow.There seems to be a spike in the number of new infections. After a week of daily figures ranging from 33 to 81 new cases per day, the government announced 135 new cases of infection for the last 24 hours which is the highest figure for 28 days."
"Curious, the French media has the details, the English I saw not: depending where you are, your life could be much less restrictive. There are two zones: other than the main hotspots (Casablanca, Fez, Tangier, Marrakech among them) most businesses other than cafés, restaurants (in house service), hammams, cinemas, theatres will reopen tomorrow. You can go out within your region without a permit; public transit will restart at 50% capacity; parks and such will reopen; salons will reopen at 50% capacity; you can practice individual sports activities such as jogging and cycling (doesn’t mention group sports such as soccer or tennis). All other restrictions remain in place such as masks and prohibition of meetings, parties, etc. For those in zone 2, you’ll still need authorization to circulate, businesses will close by 8pm (so I guess they will open as above), and transit will resume at 50% capacity. No mention of travel restrictions, however. Zone 2 (more restrictive): Tanger-Assilah, Larache, Fès, El Hajeb, Rabat, Salé, Skhirat-Témara, Kénitra, Casablanca, Mohammédia, El Jadida, Nouaceur, Médiouna, Ben Slimane, Berrechid, Marrakech."
I guess the English news sources are still analysing and translating the info as it was released overnight but you seem to have covered the main points - here is the info in French with a map showing the 2 zones https:/…

What a fascinating story................perhaps I should have done a bit more during out Moroccan lockdown rather than searching out hotels that were still prepared to sell alcohol ?????????
"Most of the vehicle owners in Morocco who wanted to return to Europe have now done so, though I'm aware that some who are in non-EU registered vehicles have not been able to leave. This is the experience of friends who took a ferry to Spain last week organised by the Spanish Embassy...The Embassy reported a load of 800 people and 200 cars. At the wharf the restaurant was closed but there was a great carnival atmosphere. Clearly most people were Moroccans travelling on Spanish plates. However on the ferry there could be no attempt at social distancing. There were horizontal bodies everywhere. Very few masks and a cacophony of noise that would have woken the devil. Against all of this there was the amazing sight of two Spanish girls at the shop. One controlling the queue and one taking the money. Surreal. Needless to say the shop was ravaged. On disembarkation the crew were risking their lives trying to control the exit flow. In the end it was a free for all so our Defender ruled supreme. Aviva Balearia!"
"Due to the lockdown, the Moroccan government allowed non residents to remain in the country past the 90 day limit that is normally given to visitors. The government has now announced that with the relaxation of travel restrictions from 15 July, non-residents are now permitted to leave the country and indeed MUST LEAVE BY 10 AUGUST.This should not be a problem for most visitors still in the country, except those wishing to exit via ferry to Spain as the borders are not open and ferries are not running.MoroccoWorldNews report: https:/…"
The only airlines able to fly in or out of Morocco are currently Royal Air Maroc and Air Arabia. RAM was initially accused of price gouging on the price of flights and has now lowered these per the linked report.MoroccoWorldNews: https:/…NOTE: I suspect there may be a missing zero on the price of flights to UK and Germany.
If you are still stuck in Morocco it might be time to be booking your flight home :)All Tourists with expired visas and entry stamps ( this is most likely close to all) must leave Morocco by August 10th or face stiff fines or maybe prison. https:/…So time to catch one of the flights out or start now to try and get a visa extension.
"Hi Tim/all,Regarding tourists leaving Morocco, do you happen to know it it is ok for a citizen of one EU country, e.g. the UK, can fly to another EU country like France, etc, as I noticed that an American on the Facebook page for Americans Stranded in Morocco, said that they had a valid visa to travel to Turkey, but the representative at the Royal Air Maroc desk (I think in Casablanca) said that they could 'only fly to their country of residence', i.e. the US in their case.- Thanks in advance"
"Update: the American lady who had a problem flying to Turkey just wrote a blog post on it:""Here’s what we found out: on these special flights, you are only allowed to fly to a country where you have residency.We called the US Embassy in Morocco- they said there were no issues with flying to Turkey. We called the US Embassy in Turkey- THEY said we could fly to Turkey. We went back to the RAM agent with this information and they said no.So, to sum it up, we have to leave Morocco but we are only allowed to go “home”. (“You don’t have to go home but you can’t stay here” is a LIE, Semisonic.)From what we can understand, this is Morocco’s rule for these flights and because these are special government flights and we’re under a State of Emergency, they can do that. (I’m not an international relations expert, so maybe they can do that anyway. Who knows! Their country, their rules I guess.)""From: https:/…- Does anyone have any further information on this? - Thanks"
"Note: for anyone interested, here is a link to the American Facebook group, which is called ""US Citizens trapped in Morocco"" - https:/…"
"I am pretty sure your refusal to be allowed to board the flight to Turkey was a RAM thing. They do not want to have to pay your return flight if Turkey refuses you entry. As who can go where changes daily , the airline is taking a more sure route and only allowing people to fly where they have valid credentials for that country.So it does not have to do with Moroccan government policy as much as it does the airline. I think anyways.It is not that you have to leave by August 10 , it is that after August 10 if you have an expired visa or entry stamp in your passport you will have to go to court and risk large fines or prison. You could always try for a visa extension .Sorry this is not better news.If you do get to Turkey you will need a travel pass from the Turkish government. Easiest way is to get a SIM card for your phone and read online what message to text to the number. Or add their app once you arrive in turkey. You can not even book an internal flight in advance with out it. You will need it for much of the public transportation too."
"It is currently not allowed to re-export vehicles via Spain, and additionally some travellers (e.g. Americans with vehicles) cannot get ferries anywhere, so it has been decided to extend the temporary vehicle import period until the 31st December 2020."

HiHave a look at this page:--https:/…
"It is a lamentable situation. The UK Embassy has a completely different take on the situation from that of the US Embassy, ""The Interior Ministry has issued instructions to regional authorities to ensure that anyone overstaying their visa due to the border closure will be able to leave without penalty when the borders re-open. British nationals whose visas have expired are welcome to join the special flights operated by Royal Air Maroc (RAM) and Air Arabia starting 15 July, but are not obliged to do so"". This advice was updated a couple of days ago and was on the website still yesterday, so seems to be the current situation. The extension of visas is meant to have been slated to last until the opening of the borders, not the end of the state of emergency on the 10th August This is borne out by the UK Embassy statement.Now if they will change this advice or it will be superseded by events, I really don't know.Edited: 7:22 pm, July 20, 2020 "
"Or the Moroccan government will use this uncertainty to collect very large fines for expired visas. As it is an unsure policy, who the heck knows."
"@Solomon: I have missed the announcement from the British Embassy, do you have a link please?"
@TimCullisIt's here:--https:/…entry-requirements
"Thanks for the link.OK, so I had seen that page and I had read it a different way, which only reinforces what I wrote about the terrible job many countries have made of communicating decisions and public information in a clear and precise manner. The first part of the announcement is clear, ""The Interior Ministry has issued instructions to regional authorities to ensure that anyone overstaying their visa due to the border closure will be able to leave without penalty when the borders re-open.""But the second part, ""British nationals whose visas have expired are welcome to join the special flights operated by Royal Air Maroc (RAM) and Air Arabia starting 15 July, but are not obliged to do so"", to me implies merely that you don't have to take advantage of the special flights and can exit using ferries or any other viable means. It certainly doesn't state in black and white that you can choose to stay in the country indefinitely. Indeed, higher up that page it states, ""British Nationals currently in Morocco will be able to leave Morocco using the same maritime and aerial routes.""At the moment I'm not 100% certain, but my assumption is that if non-resident foreigners don't leave by 10 August there will be ramifications. I would be happy to be proved to be wrong. Even happier if all these bodies knew how to write clear explanations and instructions."
"Do you have information that the ferries are accepting non-French or -Italian citizens? The airlines are not accepting citizens for flights to countries other than that of their citizenship. Nothing is clear, but I'd assumed that the ferries weren't mentioned as UK citizens won't get on them, just as they wouldn't get on a flight to Genoa or France. If the Moroccan government could just publish something concrete somewhere it would be a help.I was meant to be seeing the Commissaire at the Bureau des Etrangers tomorrow but have been warned that he could be called away. As soon as I have spoken to him, I'll post what I have learnt. Of course, the borders have not ""reopened"". There is a limited facility, mainly for MREs and residents, to leave and return and for others to fly to their own countries and not come back. As for the ferries, I do not know. I also wish that official bodies could write plainly in their mother tongues."
">>Do you have information that the ferries are accepting non-French or -Italian citizens? Yes the ferries ARE definitely accepting ALL EU citizens. But many others have turned their collective noses up at the high prices being charged and are currently still in Morocco.>>I'd assumed that the ferries weren't mentioned as UK citizens won't get on themNot the case, many of my UK, French and Dutch contacts in overland 4x4 and motorhome groups have left that way.In additional there are limited repatriation ferries running to Spain but they will only take Spanish or EU/UK citizens with residency rights, a couple of my British friends exited that route a week or so back.>>The airlines are not accepting citizens for flights to countries other than that of their citizenship.I appreciate one person got turned back trying to get to Turkey or somewhere, this was thought to be due to the airline not wanting to take the risk of having to return the passenger. If someone with a French passport lives in Belgium I can't see the airline will refuse to take them.>>Of course, the borders have not ""reopened""The form of words used in the translation of the government announcement was ""partial border reopening""."
"According to a post on travellers' site Horizons Unlimited, the Swedish, Australian and Canadian Embassies have all stated there is no longer a requirement to leave before 10 August. The wording of the post implies this is a change of heart. Several people also had this confirmed when trying to extend visas with local authorities. The US Embassy page however still insists non-Moroccan-resident citizens leave by 10 August."
"Thank you for the last two posts. Perhaps the UK Embassy was right all along. It's good to know that a ferry would be a possibility if all else fails. As for the airlines. there has been anecdotal evidence that people have been refused boarding for flights not arriving in their own countries on blogs or groups that I have seen. I would prefer to get official information, of course, about the viability of destinations, but I'm not going to risk booking yet until I can be sure. Besides, I don't want to leave the relative safety of Morocco for Europe and certainly not the UK."
"Hi Solomon, For your information: you can only use the ferry to Sete in France, and not the Genoa in Italy one, unless you have your own vehicle, because one of the stipulations of using the Italy sailing is that: ""Travellers are not allowed without their own vehicles on arrival, therefore will be denied boarding to those who have declared the use of public transport in self-certification.""And about the France sailing, you need to have had a Covid19 PCR within 72 hours of the departure time, as well as a mandatory 14-day quarantine upon arrival in France.-See this page of the ferry company's website [GNV Ferries Italy] for more information - https://www.gnv.it/en/alert-coronavirus/infoEdited: 8:44 pm, July 22, 2020 "
"Thank you for that exceedingly depressing information!I would not have gone to Italy in any case, but to learn that I'd have to self isolate in France is a bummer. Plus the bother of the tests. I'm just hoping that the embassies mentioned earlier are correct and the US one is wrong. I do not want to leave Morocco right now."
"There's two reasons the ferries are only for vehicle owners. Firstly it's a long sea crossing and passengers need a cabin in order to be able to keep apart and there's only sufficient cabins for vehicle owners. The main revenue stream is from vehicles and if he ferry company allowed hundreds of foot passengers there wouldn't be cabin space for vehicle owners, therefore the ferry would miss out on the revenue from transporting vehicles.Second reason is that the ferries are for vehicle owners travelling home and they are expected to isolate after they drive home and foot passengers would be a clear danger as they don't have their own transport.So there is no requirement to isolate when disembarking in France. Many of my contacts in the overland community have and are still going that route. Here's some snippets from a recent journey to Seté.________Tanger Med departure was similar to normal but with 3 searches of vehicles for some reason. Lots of security people reinforcing the wearing of masks and social distancing. Before boarding the captain of GNV Cristal was personally checking temperatures of passengers. On boards masks were required out of your cabin but this was ignored by many people, alarmingly more by the Europeans than the Moroccan nationals. Arriving in France, the Sapeurs pompiers (French fire brigade who also have coastguard duties) completed a questionnaire with each person basically asking is you had COVID-19. No temperature checks and obviously no guarantee individuals would admit if they had symptoms. Then we were free to leave and go wherever we wanted. I don't know France terribly well but many towns and villages looked like business as normal. Huge numbers of campervans around from across Europe, I saw French, German, Swiss, Austrian and Dutch vehicles as I travelled north.Before getting the ferry from Dieppe I had to sign a disclaimer saying I don't have COVID 19 and fill in the UK's online form about where I was doing my 14 day isolation. Arriving in the UK there was no screening or checks for the virus at all. Wearing of masks for passport control was required but then your asked by Border Force to remove it so they can see you face!"
"Hi Tim,I saw on the US Embassy website for France that: ""Quarantine Information:Travelers arriving in France must self-isolate for 14 days if they have no symptoms.""So that's why I thought it applied to non-EU countries.Also, on the French Diplomatic website for Morocco and other countries, it says (as of 26/05/20) -""The crossings that terminate in Malaga will make it possible - with the authorization of the Spanish authorities, for motor homes in particular if they stay on the highway - to return to France without the need to quarantine.""So that means they are saying if people go from Morocco to France in their motorhome by ferry, then drive to France, they do not have to quarantine, otherwise they would have to quarantine for 14 days, so I am still not sure, unless the French entry requirements have changed in the last 8 weeks..Edited: 9:12 am, July 23, 2020 "

"@ UK2019I am confused , are you saying foot passengers can not go on the Morocco to Italy ferry but can go on the France one. Or that no foot traffic can go on either ferry, just those with a vehicle?"
"TBH, I don't know why UK2019travelguy is being scolded. It's not only certain people who get to decide what's relevant or not and in my view, information about ferries is relevant.I didn't see a question either, just information and links.Edited: 12:22 pm, July 23, 2020 "
"Hi Comicman,On the GNV Ferry website (linked below, in my previous post), it stipulates that they will not accept any passengers on the Italy sailing to Genoa if they have arrived at the port by public transport, as that means they could have picked up the virus on the way (i.e. it's quite likely in Tangier, what with the spike of case there at the moment), so by arriving in your own vehicle, you will not have had contact with potential Coronavirus carriers, and so are therefore deemed ""safe"" by the Italian authorities, to receive you in Italy.So, no, without your own vehicle, you cannot board the ferry to Italy.For the France sailing to Sete, with the same company [GNV Italy], you can travel as a foot passenger, i.e. without your own vehicle, but to go to France, the authorities there are demanding that all passengers have had a Covid19 PCR test within 72 of the ferry's departure time."
"Hi Solomon,Thanks and there is information, and also the question within is:Can a UK citizen travel to another EU country, e.g. France (CDG airport, Paris), or Holland (Amsterdam), with AIR ARABIA, and NOT (!) Royal Air Maroc (RAM), because not only are RAM more expensive, they are also apparently 'insisting' that all passengers ""Only return to their 'Home Country'"".In going back to the UK directly from Morocco, this involves a mandatory 14-day quarantine, whereas by transiting through France or the Netherlands, no quarantine is required.I do not want to return to the UK at the moment anyway, as I have business in Europe, and it is more convenient for me to go somewhere else in Europe, and not the UK.Plus, as an EU citizen, I should be entitled to go anywhere in Europe to travel and conduct business, and it should not be down to an airline to decide that!"
"Hi again all,Well it looks like you can only fly to your ""home country"" or ""country of residence"", with both RAM and *also* Air Arabia, as a UK citizen was today Removed By Police From Tangier airport!! Unbelievable but true, and this clearly makes the airline policy clear, i.e. not based on ""opinion"", this is a 'hard case of evidence' today!- As a UK citizen, with Italian residency status, he tried to go to Spain (Malaga), but was physically removed from the airport this afternoon by police, with No Explanation why, his air ticket was confiscated, and he was led out of the airport building, with no refund or further information!See the following screenshot links for the posts, taken from the Facebook group ""US Citizens stranded in Morocco"": CONVERSATION LINK 1: https://ibb.co/rsy4Cv1LINK 2: https://ibb.co/sFPgScZEdited: 3:28 pm, July 23, 2020 "
"In reply to message #158 from Tim:When cabins on ferries become fully booked, there are always ""Pullman seats"" available, so there is capacity for more foot passengers ;)"
"UK2019travelguyThanks for this. I'd also seen some blog posts or groups where people had told of not being allowed on to flights terminating in countries other than their citizenship.Like the poor guy in the screenshots, I'm hanging around for proper commercial flights and the guarantee of reentry."
"@Solomon (post 147): ""The extension of visas is meant to have been slated to last until the opening of the borders, not the end of the state of emergency on the 10th August This is borne out by the UK Embassy statement.""It seems my reading of the situation in post #135 was correct, and any foreign visitors who don't have a carte sejour residency card MUST LEAVE Morocco by 10 August to avoid penalty. The Foreign Office Travel advice for Morocco at https:/…entry-requirements has been updated and now reads,""The Interior Ministry previously issued instructions to regional authorities to ensure that anyone overstaying their visa due to the border closure will be able to leave without penalty when the borders re-open.

Maybe you misconstrued it..?- To leave Morocco by air, you do not need to do a PCR or serology COVID19 test, but to enter Morocco at the moment, you need to provide both at check-in of your flight, otherwise you will be denied boarding.- Quarantine applies to both people going from Morocco to the UK (14 days' quarantine in the UK), and from other countries to Morocco (5 or 9 days' quarantine, I can't remember the duration correctly!)"

"Here's a communication I got on WhatsApp from an American friend. The part in quotes is a direct C&P from an email she got from the Embassy:--Anyway, here's the latest, all embassies are walking back their comments. ""Foreign citizens in the country without a visa who were unable to depart Morocco within the normal 90-day limit will be permitted to exit without a fine until AT LEAST August 10. The government has not announced whether foreign citizens will be able to continue to depart without a fine after August 10""I capitalised the ""at least"" as that is a change from the previous advice. As always, it's cryptic and not clear. It seems to be saying that foreigners may be allowed to continue to leave after Aug 10th."

"UK2019travelguyI've looked at it. And I repeat my question. What is a US consul in Portugal doing advising about Morocco, for a start, and why is he alleging what has been said to the UK Ambassador? It just doesn't ring true, especially as the US consul carries on his message to say ""we"" will be updating and ""we"" will be chasing the Moroccans but gives UK website information and mentions the FCO, not the State Department.

The reasoning behind the dates is unknown, but this is a further nail in the coffin of the attempts to get non-resident foreigners to leave.Story: https:/…"
"There is continued confusion about the need for foreigners visitors (i.e. non-resident without holding a carte de sejour) to leave Morocco by 10 August.Following the partial opening of the borders on 15 July, various news media reported that non-resident foreigners who were unable to leave Morocco within the normal 90-day limit would be permitted to exit without penalty until the [current] end of Morocco’s state of emergency on August 10 and that those who do not leave by then, and hadn't legally extend their stay, COULD BE SUBJECT TO FINES or imprisonment.It appears the source for this was a statement from the US Embassy following a communication with the Moroccan Ministry of Interior, and additionally Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita, was quoted as saying it was time the visitors left.The UK Embassy put out an ambiguous statement saying that non-resident foreigners could now leave and were welcome to use Royal Air Maroc and Air Arabia Maroc, but did not have to. One way of reading this was that foreigners could instead use ferries, others read this as meaning the non-resident foreigners did not have to leave.On 24 July the UK Foreign and commonwealth Office advice for Morocco was changed to agree with that of the US Embassy, viz, """"The Interior Ministry previously issued instructions to regional authorities to ensure that anyone overstaying their visa due to the border closure will be able to leave without penalty when the borders re-open. These instructions will expire on 10 August and anyone overstaying their visa after this date will be subject to fines on departure. British nationals whose visas have expired should join the special flights operated by Royal Air Maroc (RAM) and Air Arabia.""The advice was updated 28 or 29 July to remove the warning about fines, but still states non-resident foreigners should leave by 10 August, ""The Moroccan authorities have advised that foreigners on visit visas must return home by 10 August. British nationals whose visas have expired should join the special flights operated by Royal Air Maroc (RAM) and Air Arabia. Any British citizen with a visit visa who would like to apply for residency in Morocco should visit http://service-public.ma/en/web/guest/home for further information.""This is still the ONLY CURRENT OFFICIAL ADVICE from the UK authorities and the current page can be seen at https:/…entry-requirementsIn the meantime the US Embassy page has been updated to read, ""Foreign citizens in the country without a visa who were unable to depart Morocco within the normal 90-day limit will be permitted to exit without a fine until at least August 10. The government has not announced whether foreign citizens will be able to continue to depart without a fine after August 10."" Current page status is at https://ma.usembassy.gov/25161/A couple of screenshots have been circulating purporting to come from ""Steve, HM Consul"" that initially state foreigners should leave unless they have a good reason otherwise, in which case they should regularise their status with an extension. The second states that in a conversation between Tom Reilly (British Ambassador) and Nasser Bourita (Moroccan Foreign Minister) it was stated that whilst the borders remain officially closed to other than repatriation flights, there will be no fines for overstaying. I'm unable to track the veracity of either of these statement and can't find anything on the twitter feeds.Edited: 6:31 am, July 30, 2020 "
