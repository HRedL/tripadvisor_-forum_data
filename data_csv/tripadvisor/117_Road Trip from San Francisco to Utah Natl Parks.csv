"Hi All! Our family is planning our road trip from San Francisco to National Parks in Utah. We're leaving on June 1st and aren't in much of a hurry. We'd like help finding the drive that's most interesting - with national parks to stop at along the way. An idea for an itinerary would be very helpful, as well. We're looking at Zion, Arches and Bryce stops in Utah. Thanks for your help!"
"Hi,Due to COVID-19, Yosemite and Death Valley are closed. https:/…covid19.htmhttps:/…conditions.htmEdited: 9:09 pm, May 20, 2020 "
Will these NP's be open by June 1? Will you be able to find lodging?
"Thanks for replying! Phased reopening currently - looking like May 29th may be the date.Depending on the route we thought maybe stopping in some parks in Nevada.Edited: 9:24 pm, May 20, 2020 "
What is your draft itinerary? How are you planning to stay safe?
We're in the planing stages - no itinerary yet. Hoping to get some help on this forum re: driving route and timing.
"You are planning on leaving in less than two weeks and don't have a real plan or hotel reservations in place?Here's a suggested itinerary for the Utah parks, assuming you will be entering Utah via I 80..Day 1: Enter Utah on I 80. In SLC, take I 15 south and on to Torrey, Utah. Base for Capitol Reef NP. (3.5 hour drive, no stops from SLC) ***Lose an hour on the clock entering Utah.Day 2: Capitol ReefDay 3: Drive to Moab, Utah with stop at Goblin Valley State Park. Plan on at least an hour at Gablin Valley. (3.5 hour drive, no stops)Day 4 and 5: Arches and CanyonlandsDay 6: Drive to Page, Arizona. This is to break up the long drive to Zion NP. Antelope Canyon tours near Page are currently suspended. (4 hour drive.) ***Gain an hour on the clock entering Arizona.Day 7: Drive to Springdale, Utah/Zion NP. 3 hour drive. ***Lose an hour on the clock entering Utah.Day 8: ZionDay 9: Drive Bryce Canyon 2.5 hour drive.Day 10: Head back to California.Note that access to Zion is limited. The shuttle buses are not running. Visitors can drive their car up the scenic drive in the main canyon. There's limited parking in the main canyon. Access to the canyon will be closed if parking lots are full.You need to settle on a plan very quickly and get your lodging reservations made. You may find that due to Covid19 restrictions, some hotels may be closed thus putting pressure on general hotel availability.You should be prepared with face masks for every one as our Governor has asked everyone to wear them when in public places. You should also practice social distancing everywhere you go, including the national parks.Do not show up at any of these destinations without advance hotel reservations.Edited: 10:18 pm, May 20, 2020 "
Thank you for your help! Just what I was looking for. The go ahead will depend on lodging availability and park openings.
"Welcome to the Road Trips forum. You should be fine on this trip. Just go into it with flexibility. Consider crossing Nevada on US50. Great Basin National Park in Ely, Nev. has a good amount open. It's a great highway but just make sure to fuel up in Fallon, again in Austin and in Ely. You should have no issue finding lodging. Parks should be reasonably accessible, with Zion potentially presenting the only real challenges with the shuttle not running.Just come prepared with an open mind and ability to adjust plans as you go. Mother Nature is waiting for you.Have fun."
"If you drive highway 50 across Nevada, then you can start your trip with Bryce, then Zion and counter clockwise around the route I gave you ending with Torrey and Capitol Reef. Or you can still start with Capitol Reef and do the clockwise itinerary.Which way you do the trip is going to depend on where you can get hotel reservations. As noted the national parks are open with some restrictions. So get to work on your accommodation reservations.Edited: 10:13 am, May 21, 2020 "
"Also, make sure fuel is topped off wherever you get on US-50. Services are limited."
"Good, good - starting to work on lodging today. We might have to change our departure city to San Mateo, CA. Would you suggest taking the I5 route or sticking to I80? Also, we are continuing to the southeastern US instead of coming back to California. Would these two changes alter the trip entirely?"
"What difference does it make, leaving from SF or from San Mateo? Do you currently live in SF? Are you moving out of state?"
"Heading to the southeast may or may not change your route depending on how quickly you want to head south from Utah. You could start with Capitol Reef, head to Bryce, then Zion and around to Moab. From Moab, you would head in to Colorado on I 70 and maybe head south near Denver. Or you could back track from Moab to Mesa Verde NP/Durango in southwest Colorado and then work your way southeast from there.Or you could skip both Capitol Reef and Moab. That route would be Bryce, Zion, Page, Monument Valley. From Monument Valley, you would head in to New Mexico to get south.I don't think your departure point makes any difference as San Mateo is in the general Bay area. Not sure why you are thinking about taking I 5 south. Is that because you are trying to get to Yosemite and other points of interest in California before heading in to Utah? The logical/fastest route from the Bay area to Utah is I 80 or highway 50 across Nevada."
"Ok, got it! I thought it might make a difference if we left from a little further south."
Also I thought we would head down I5 for Yosemite and DV and just realized that they are closed. Someone said that in the string yesterday and I missed that! So it seems like I80 is our best bet all the way around :) You're right about that!
Are there any Nevada parks or interesting spots on the way that we should consider stopping at?
Great Basin National Park is doing a phased re-opening at present. It's just east of Ely (E-lee) on US-50. Best star gazing in the US.https://www.nps.gov/grba/index.htm
"There's very little on I 80 in Nevada but desert, jack rabbits and sage brush with a few small towns here and there. If you take highway 50 thru Nevada to Great Basin NP, you need to know that it's called ""The Loneliest Road in the World"" . There will be no services of any kind across Nevada. Gas up and have food/water with you."
"Connie, I hate to disagree with you because you are usually spot on. But I've driven across Nevada on Highway 50 more times than I like, and it has out grown the name of the Loneliest Road in the World. These days it is full of traffic including cars and semis, even though it is still a two lane road. At least it is more interesting than I-80.Once you leave Reno, there are services (gas stations, restaurants, hotels, etc.) in Fallon, Austin, Eureka, and Ely."
"Well, anyway it's ""The Loneliest Road in America"".....I've gone across there every way possible but walking. One day in '77 it was surely the LRA as I got stuck hitching east out of Austin for 3 days. Traffic volume has really picked up a lot just by calling it the ""LRA""...gets that Route 66 mystique. Unless I'm really pressed for time, I take it every time.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKyOSc1-lvQ"
"I would skip Monument Valley and Antelope Canyon entirely. Navajo Nation has been hit really hard, and I'm not sure how they are handling tourism. That means you can drop Page (unless you absolutely need a picture of Horseshoe Bend) and can spend more time trying for a spot at Zion.Each park is opening in its own way, and Zion is currently day-use only, no shuttles. They open up the park to vehicles until the in-park parking (~400 spots) is full. Then they close the gates until someone leaves. So either you have to get there really early, hope that people circulate through quickly, or take bikes with you to bike in.Looks like Bryce is decently accessible - I have a two different sets of friends there this weekend, and they seem to be enjoying themselves.So double-check each park you're looking to visit just before you arrive, or follow them on social media.Good luck!"
