We are due to holiday in Grenada in early Dec.My partner has just finished 8 months intensive cancer treatment.I have just read in the paper that Chikungunya virus is now an epidemic and naturally am concerned.Should we be going?
"Two years ago, we wanted to do our yearly ""caribic Thing"". We booked everything. Then my husband got a cancer diag. He was successfully operated, but due to Chik, the doctors said it would be better to wait Abit. After Chemo. After Radiation AND after getting the immune System back where it should be. We waited. In two weeks WE WILL BE THERE!!!"
"I got married on Grenada at the end of October, we had 24 family members with us (ranging from 7 months to 78 years of age), in total we had 188 person days on the island. Not one of us got ""chicken"". The locals say it is there, but it is not being serologically confirmed, so everything that was a cold is probably now being labelled as chicken. You have to be sensible, use mosquito repellent. Most of the resorts will fog (spice island certainly did several times in the 10 days I was there) and there was government fogging too. Does you partner now have a normal immune system? If not, I guess you should question whether you should be going anywhere where the health system is not comparable to the UK (ie limited intensive care should a standard infection become serious in an immunocompromised individual). If so, enjoy your holiday."
"Bobgda, I agree that if you have had chicken then you probably know what it is, but if you haven't had it, then you might label a cold/other viral illness as it. There are after all a lot of other viral illness that cause rashes and pyrexia. This is similar to everyone who has never had to influenza, calling ever rhinovirus (cold) flu. And I suspect most people in Grenada would not pay to be serological tested, and quite frankly what's the point. You prove you had it, get a certificate of achievement, can tell everyone that you definitely had chicken, but can't do anything about it, so why spend the money."
"I have just returned (mid November 2014) from The Spice Island Beach Resort where I started to suffer the symptoms on the last 2 days of the trip and hit the worst immediately after landing in the UK. As we had not left the hotel premises for more than a week before the symptoms started I must have been infected by bites in the hotel grounds.If you have a low immune system I would not recommend going and even if fully fit would think twice or take extreme precautions as the experience is highly unpleasant.The bites that cause the virus occur during the day rather than the usual night time mosquito biting times and are difficult to protect against without being fully clothed - not recommended in the heat of Grenada.The Spice Island Resort is being ""fogged"" by the Health Ministry at least 2 days a week , and twice a day. The first fogging starts at about 5-45 in the evening and lasts for about an hour stopping just before dinner. The second fogging starts at about 5-00 in the morning. The fogging is extremely loud so early morning wake ups are guaranteed. The fumes are heavy and unpleasant and it is highly recommended to stay locked indoors. Therefore if you like early morning beach walks or a pre-dinner cocktail or drink forget about it for at least a third of your holiday.The annoying aspect is that although chikungunya is now an epidemic there are no warnings or advice at the airport or the hotel, as it appears it is being covered up to avoid the loss of tourist bookings. Even when we informed the hotel of the unusual number and types of bites we were getting during the day there was no reaction.The reason given by the Hotel for fogging is to comply with Government regulations and no mention at all of the fever.In fact we found that the number of insects and bites increased after each fogging as the insects were driven out of their natural homes into the public areas and rooms. Fogging is intended to destroy the breeding grounds more than to kill the insects and is useless when open drains filled with stagnant water run the length of the hotel on the public road a matter of yards from the entrance and hotel suites. The beach front rooms seem to have slightly less problems due to the sea breezes"
"Alfred, it is interesting that you got lots of bites at spice island, as we too stayed there and I would not say insect bites were a particular problem. That said, there was a wide variety even within our group. My sister in law reacts terribly to insect notes which come up in bug red wheels, but she did not get the chicken. I wonder whether the weather has anything to do with it. Whilst we had little rain when we were there, I am led to believe the first week of November was very wet."
"Thanks bobGDA for all the information. It is fine that we can speculate among ourselves on here about the source and likely progression or recession of the virus. My concern is that there was very little information about the problem on the internet before we travelled, there were absolutely no warnings or advice at the airport on arrival from the Health Ministry and the Hotels are not providing information to guests.Even when we showed the hotel the bites we had received they did not think to mention the potential problem and just told us to put on some after bite cream or aloe vera. This all hints at a cover up to protect the tourist industry and is the wrong approach although I understand there is some local stigma attached to having the virus among residents who do not understand how it is spread;We have previously visited infected areas such as Mauritius where the authorities and hotels were open about the issue, gave advice, and we therefore took preventative action during the biting periods. Given a choice of locations to visit I am more likely to visit a country that is open and honest about health issues than one that ignores or covers up the situation. Grenada's short term tourist protectionism could well back fire in the longer term."
"Why is it the hotels responsibility to tell you? Chickigunga has been around in Asia for a long time, but I don't expect a hotel to inform me if I go there. Similarly when you go to a malaria zone, it is your responsibility to get that information not your travel agent or hotels to tell you. I looked at the foreign office info on it before I went, so the info is there if you want to look for it, as my father in law had heard about it and wanted more information. The information is there if you want it. So I disagree that it is a cover up, they are telling you why they are fogging. What do you expect a hotel to do if you tell them you have bites? Dengue has been in the carribbean for years but no one is panicking about that and you are probably more likely to die from Dengue than chicken."
"I agree it is not the hotels RESPONSIBILITY to inform guests but do you not think it would be helpful?. The hotel does not say why it is fogging - just that it is to comply with ministry regulations.My issue is more with the Health Authorities approach.Information is available on the internet but try telling that to the elderly couple we met who do not have a PC or use the Internet.I had not mentioned Travel Agents but as you raise the matter they do have the responsibility to advise clients booking trips , either with direct advice on the situation or by telling their clients to refer to another source Before we left and even today the FCO site reports some cases on Grenada - it does not report the epidemic state. I will leave it to you to decide why that information has not found it's way from Grenada to the FCO.My original post was in response to the lady who asked about the suitability of a visit for her husband recovering from cancer and my answer to her remains the same.Therefore my final comment on this thread is that no one is to blame for the virus but how authorities deal with it is open to inspection and comment."
Thank you Alfred L for getting back to the OP. I agree with you and your answer.
"The foreign office directs you to www.nathnac.org, which is the travel advice page. There is information on it there."
"Alfred, if you feel strongly that spice island should have told you, feed it back to them, they are very receptive. The general managers name is Brian hardy, his email address is gm@spicebeachresort.com We chatted to lots of people whilst we were there about it."
"I was not going to post on this topic again but re the suggestion from MoonsterUK to contact Mr Hardy I have to respond.Mr Hardy was one of the people I spoke to at dinner and I queried with him the number and variety of daytime insects and bites that I was receiving as I had not experienced that level at the hotel on previous visits.The only response received, in his usual jovial fashion, was that the local insects 'like to top up on good English blood when they have the opportunity' . While it is not the hotels responsibility to give advice, a slightly more informative response based on the facts may have been appropriate.Sir Royston Hopkin or his daughter Janelle Hopkin are far more responsive to any queries or problems."
"Interesting discussion on the Chikungunya virus, to the OP I believe it would be sensible to avoid the whole Caribbean region and Florida if you or your relative are imunocompremised . All the islands have the virus at this time and there are confirmed cases in the south of the USA. All the island also have Dengue fever also carried by Mosquitos and the haemorrhagic version has a high mortality rate. I would be more worried about this. It spend many months a year in the islands and know many people who have suffered, for most it is a two week illness with occasional joint pains following this.Whether it is a resort or governments responsibility to inform guests of these issues is an interesting debate. There is certainly plenty of information in the media about these disease so just a small amount of interest in an island before travel will provide all the information needed. No one informs people of the crime or murder rate before they travel but the information is available as well. I discussed Chikungunya with the staff at Spice Island on numerous occasions there was no 'cover up' by either the staff or management they even put insect repellant in the rooms for the guests to use so they are in no way denying that it occurs.Time for us all to take responsibility for our actions and choices and not expect others to be responsible for us."
"It know of two people in Antigua who have had haemorahgic dengue, both survived but only just!"
"I think this is an interesting discussion, and munmunmum certainly raises an interesting point regarding crime and murder rates. I do not think Grenada is actively covering anything, whether it is a bit more passively head in the sand that the UK or America might be about such an issue is another matter. However, mass hysteria is also not useful thing, as was the case with the swine flu epidemic in the UK a few years ago.As for dengue - we are aware of one person who had haemorrhagic dengue in Antigua."
"I visited in Sept., I tested positive for it when I returned home. The flu-like symptoms were bad, but the lingering joint pain is the worst, it's been going on for a few months."
"I visited in Sept. and tested positive when I got home. The flu-like symptoms are bad,but the lingering joint pain is the worst! It's been 2 months and I'm still suffering. :("
"Interestingly (and rather worryingly) AlfredL's review of the Spice Island resort, in which he detailed the information he quite validly gave higher up in this thread, appears to have been removed. My take away from that is that one cannot necessarily rely on Tripadvisor as a source of advice from other travellers. I am not sure what Tripdavisor's reasoning is, and there may well be a good explanation, but if this is a case of 'we make our money from travel and therefore we remove negative stuff that might compromise our revenue stream' then I am seriously unimpressed with the morality and the reasoning. We like TA because it's a good way of sharing information, not because we want that information to be editorialised. TA, what's the story here please?"
"I believe that Alfred's review of SI was removed because it was not a review of the hotel itself it was a review of a mosquito bourn virus that can be caught in all places in Grenada as well as throughout the Caribbean and Florida.Further more, I have received personal messages requesting information on this as Alfred's review is actually WRONG. Spice Island resort is not fogged twice a day as Alfred writes but twice a week once in the evening and once in the morning, this is a government initiative not SI choice.Hotel reviews need to be about the resort, it's staff, food rooms and ambience and above all need to be correct. Alfred's post remains here for all to see so hardly censorship."
"Before there is any suggestion I am employed by the hotel I will state categorically I am not, I have holidayed there three times, have a home in the Caribbean and have some knowledge of life in the Caribbean ."
"I also have had a very happy trip to SI, have stayed elsewhere on the island and also have a home in the Caribbean. So I feel about as qualified as you to have an opinion. My opinion is that the hotel, all hotels in fact, should as part of their duty of care to their guests, make an explicit acknowledgement of the issue so that people are sufficiently aware to take protective measures - at least until the epidemic phase is over. It is not enough to assume that travellers will have had sufficient information from their home countries' government info travel sites because much of the available information is out of date or thin. I also point you to the following URL, which is TA's own guidelines for writing reviews and is not as far as I can see congruent with your own definition of what an appropriate review covers. Put it this way: SI is an incredibly good hotel in a beautiful place with the best staff imaginable BUT had I personally caught ChikV whilst staying there, I would remember that above all else. It is highly relevant how a hotel handles this sort of thing.https://www.tripadvisorsupport.com/hc/en-us/…Edited: 5 years ago "
"Please be sure I am not claiming to be more qualified than anyone else to have an opinion on this issue. I am simply saying that some of the information given in the removed review was incorrect, the resort was not fogged twice a day as the removed review suggests. I have responded to personal messages from two people who were concerned enough to message me regarding this.I discussed Chukungunya with the staff at the hotel both management and others and there was never any evidence of a cover up as suggested. Spice Island provide Deet in the rooms for the use of their guests. There is plenty of evidence in the media surrounding this both on forums like this, in national British media and in local media. I am sad for the poster that his illness occurred but also do not think SI is to blame for it."
"Sorry Munmunmun but before stating that my post is WRONG please read it carefully and please do not mis-represent my comments. I clearly stated that the fogging is conducted by the ministry not by the hotel, I clearly stated that it is fogged at least 2 days a week and that when it is fogged it is fogged twice a day and I quoted the exact times that it is fogged in the evening and morning.Interestingly during our stay one pre-advised fogging was cancelled, and we were told it was cancelled at the hotels request due the late arrival of a BA flight and the fact that the hotel did not want guests checking in during a fogging.My post to the Spice Island page was deleted by Tripadvisor (after I was previously advised it had been approved by them). Apparently my comment that early morning beach walks and pre dinner drinks were not possible during fogging of the hotel were no longer deemed to be of insufficient detail or interest to readers nor were my star ratings of the hotel services. I suspect that the second review of my post and the subsequent deletion of my post resulted from a complaint made to Tripaddvisor - a complaint along the lines of the explanation you posted here earlier as to why my post was deleted.I agree with the post above from TimboLondon that the SI is a good hotel in a wonderful location but how they and the health authorities handle these situations is highly relevant. Having asked specific questions at the hotel on 3 occasions and having received misleading or no information in reply I feel perfectly justified in commenting on the subject."
"Hi AlfredYou post on page 1 statesThe Spice Island Resort is being ""fogged"" by the Health Ministry at least 2 days a week , and twice a day. The first fogging starts at about 5-45 in the evening and lasts for about an hour stopping just before dinner. It is the 'and twice a day' that I am saying is incorrect and is the query that others have written to me about. SI does not fog twice a day. In the week I was there this time from the 25 October until 1st November it fogged to my knowledge once in the evening, this took 30 mins and was finished well before 7pm, there may have been fogging in the morning once but I walked the beach at 5.45 (first light) each day and never saw any evidence nor heard any sound.Of course you are entitled to your opinion in the same way that others are entitelled to challenge it that is the nature of a forum.It hope you are felling better now."
"I think we are just going to have to agree to disagree on the facts. Our trips overlapped slightly and the hotel was fogged on the evening of Wednesday 29th October, and only finished outside our room at 6.45 pm . Fogging occurred next on the morning of Thursday 30th October waking us shortly after 5-00am. Fogging occurred next on Saturday November 1st in the evening, again finishing shortly before dinner and this pattern of fogging continued until our departure in mid November. The size and length of the property would naturally mean that one area of the hotel would have been completed well before another;I am sure you are aware that the hotel issued individual letters to guests to pre- advise of the dates, times and expected duration of each fogging but there is little point in my re-typing the dates and times from the letters here. My only error in wording of my original post was to state fogging twice a day rather than twice in 24 hours. To be 100% accurate there were 4 fogging sessions per week. 2 sessions starting in the evening at 5-45 and 2 sessions early the following mornings - a gap of 12 hours;. Call it one fogging on 4 days a week or 2 foggings on 2 days a week but it is not really important. I have encountered fogging, albeit with less frequency, in many hotels in many parts of the world over many years and it really is not an issue nor the key point of this thread. The hotel is in no way responsible for any infection I developed but my concern is why I could not get a straightforward answer to a straightforward question of why fogging was happening with such a frequency.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Dear Alfred. I see from your tripadvisor travel map that you are well travelled, including trips to other Caribbean islands and Africa. Did any of the hotels that you stayed in in these other countries advise you of the risk of Dengue Fever, Malaria, HIV, typhoid, polio, cholera, diphtheria, TB, leptospirosis, tetanus, hepatits A, B or C, rabies, schistosomiasis, meningococcal, travellers diarrhoea, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, herpes, filariasis, west nile virus, chagas, cryptosporidium, legionellas...? I am sorry that you were unlucky enough to get chickingunja, but unlucky is what it is and nothing to do with the hotel you stayed in. If you had stayed next door in the Coyaba or the Radisson, your risk of it would have been the same so are you going to paste your review stating there is a risk of Chickingunja on their tripadvisor pages, and infact every hotel in the carribbean and florida also? With regards to how spice island handled your questions - at any point did you ask to see a doctor? I am sure they would have been obliging if you had. Otherwise, they are not medically trained, and given that there is no medical treatment for chickingunja apart from supportive, what were you hoping they would advise you? To the OP, take of this discussion what you wish - the bottom line is that yes chickingunja is in the carribbean. Will you definitely get it, no - assuming that Alfred was there with his partner, of 28 people that spent 1-2 weeks in Grenada recently, 1 got it, 27 didn't. My original comment on whether you should be travelling anywhere that has less than first rate healthcare facilities if you are immunosuppressed remains. In contrast some medical professionals would believe that vitamin D, which is obtained from sunlight, will boost your immune response so could help with immunity on return to the UK. The evidence for this however is a little patchy. Furthermore, as the foreign office is not advising against travel to Grenada, I would be surprised if your travel insurance would support cancelling a trip based on the current level of advice. Best of luck with your decision."

"PS - When I stayed at spice island two years ago before anyone ever discussed chickingunja, they fogged several times during the period when we were there. Furthermore the fogging performed on 29th October was not a spice island specific fogging, it was done at government level all along grand anse beach, and did seem more toxic than the other fogging sessions. That said, within 20-30minutes we were able to sit on our terrace again, so also hardly a big deal."
Goodbye John G.
"John, as I have said above, I think the removal is a matter of some concern too. It's not called Hotel Advisor, or Restaurant Advisor, or Attraction Advisor, it's called Trip Advisor and so IMHO people are here to share their experiences as a whole. If a particular traveller feels that a particular hotel, for example, might have been clearer as to a particular risk (for example, are there a lot of sea urchins right in front of the hotel?) then I personally think it is entirely fair to say so. It is the sort of thing others want to know. Regarding Moonster's comments, I am glad to hear that their large party went so well and they had such a low infection rate but I must say that the Chik situation is rather different from the examples he gives: it is currently epidemic (though it may now be on a rapid decline after a recent peak) rather than endemic and regardless of whether or not a particular hotel should or shouldn't warn of that level of risk, a traveller who feels under informed is IMHO entirely entitled to say so. There are a lot of people planning upcoming trips and they are all adult enough to make their own decisions - but if information is removed, they cannot do so."
"If a review has been removed that you or the original reviewer feel has not violated any of TA's guidelines, then notify TA about said review , they will then look at the review to see if it does or does not deserve to be removed or not. What one must understand about TA and removal of reviews, and forum posts too for that matter, is that it is almost entirely automatic, for forum posts click on the "" report as inappropriate "" button, select on the drop down menu your reason, click on that, and when a certain unknown number is reached, ( 3 , 5, 6, 10 ? ) then the post is automatically removed, same as reviews, click on the little "" flag "" down at the bottom of the review , select your reason and after a certain number of hits it will be removed. And again, if you feel it has not violated any of the TA guidelines then get in touch with TA and they will look at it and make a decision to restore it or not, and yes I have seen many forum posts and reviews reinstated.It is fairly common for "" cheerleaders "" of resorts to try and have any detrimental reviews of "" their "" resort removed.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Timbolondon - everyone here keeps commenting on the 'epidemic' rates of chikungunja in the carribbean. Please show me some published figures for Grenada that are more than hearsay or within the lay media, if my non-scientific 1 in 28 but about as scientific as everyone that is claiming to have had it with no serological evidence of it is not good enough. The most recent I can find for Grenada is 5 per 100000, so in fact my 1 in 28 is higher than that! What I was trying to illustrate to the OP though was that even of it is 1 in 28 or 5 per 100000, there is chickingunja in the area, as there is dengue, millions of virus's that we also have on the UK etc, but thus does not mean you are guaranteed to get it or not get it. With regards to reviews, when I read hotel reviews, I want to know about that particular hotel. I agree that how it fits within the local environment is also important and maybe minor comments within a review but for a review to only mention a nationwide issue and nothing about the actual hotel is, in my opinion, in appropriate. If I posted a whole review moaning about the fact it had rained all week, would that be appropriate? Additionally, as someone who posts a lot of reviews on tripadvisor, I have also had reviews removed in the past for rather unclear reasons, but all I have done is alter that slightly and repost them, usually not to be removed again. If you feel strongly that no post should ever be removed, expect the reviews to become cluttered with irrelevant facts. Indeed, I think this has actually added some healthy discussion to the TA forums, rather than the often dry topics, and in particular the incessant 'I'm going to sandals' posts that have taken over. Healthy debate and several opinions actually enables people to make better decisions. But nonetheless there will also be some people that choose to stay head in sand about these things..."
"Moonster,These are the facts as I see them:1) Most people do not get tested, in fact a lot of them don't even go to the doctor unless they are in a risk group. It's a fairly poor island with limited medical facilities compared to what US or UK citizens are accustomed to.2) There is no on-island testing facility - as is widely the case in the Caribbean.3) The 'official' figures therefore reflect 1 & 2 above rather than the actual numbers on the ground.4) This article from mid September has useful information from a local medical professional indicating a 60% rate:caribbean360.com/news/grenada-doctor-claims-…5) I have a number of useful and reliable sources of information on the island and on other islands. My Grenadian sources tell me that it is their own opinion, and that of local medical experts, that somewhere now well north of 60% (I hear 65-70%) have been infected. That, by any standards, is (or rather by now has been) an epidemic.6) Epidemiological studies from previous outbreaks, for example that in Mauritius in 2006, indicate via mathematical models involving many co-factors (rainfall, population size and distribution, geography etc) that once levels of over 65% have been reached, 'herd immunity' becomes progressively more likely to lead to the epidemic tailing off as the vector/host cycle is broken by a lack of naive hosts. Grenada is, from everything I know, likely in that tailing off phase, though a key variable that might change this is the amount of fresh blood that gets shipped in with the new peak tourist season.7) I therefore personally think that the odds are greatly improving in favour of a safe trip to Grenada this winter: I would far rather go there (and indeed am going) than to places where the disease is currently ramping up rather than down. But a friend with cancer and ongoing therapy has decided not to go and I fully support that decision.8) You mentioned Florida above. Florida has so far had very few cases of autocthonous transmission and there is a reasonable chance that the disease won't take off there but if it does gain sufficient momentum, the epidemic phase is likely, from my reading, to last longer because the population is so much larger and the geography and demographics are different.Overall, I think the danger in Grenada is far lower now than it was in September (when a close associate of mine contracted it, as well as many other people I know or know of) but, no two ways about it, this has been an epidemic and will continue to be so in the wider region for some time to come. It's an African and Asian disease, new to this part of the world and at the start of all this, no one in the region had immunity.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Timbo and Bob, I think you both make very fair points about this, and I have not ever debated that chik is not in Grenada. However, I, as a medical professional, know that most people that tell me they have flu actually had a cold; most people that tell me they had a chest infection, actually had a cold; most people that tell me they had an episode of asthma actually had an episode of viral induced wheeze; many people that think they had appendicitis actually had a completely normal looking appendix removed at surgery. Thus, patient reported episode are highly inaccurate because people like to have what is trendy or sounds more serious. I also know that there are several other causes for fever, rash, myalgia and arthralgia, but as with the swine flu situation in the UK a few years back, everyone that had even the mildest of cold symptoms will tell you they had swine flu. As such, I remain of the view that the actual number of people that have had chik in Grenada or other countries that cannot serologically test will remain unknown, and all reports are simply speculative. Also, as a visitor for 1-2 weeks, you need to consider that this reported 65% of people is perhaps of people who have had a much longer exposure period than the average traveller. Furthermore, I am not advocating that Grenada, or any other country including the UK should be wasting money testing for something which will not alter you management or outcome."
"As a medical professional, you also no doubt know that the disease with the most similar symptoms to those of Chik is Dengue, which is also endemic in the region. Otherwise, most other possibilities are symptomatically easily distinguished. Dengue has pretty low incidence in Grenada and has been around for years, with the occaisional flare up, without putting anyone off travelling to the island. There is no evidence of a current flare up.We are agreed that most people who present with Chik like symptoms either seek no treatment or, if they do, get no serological proof. We can therefore assume that good local medics are like to make a series of 'rule of thumb' judgements as to what they are seeing. Leaving aside 'lazygunya', which might trust be a patronising diminution of the suffering of others or might be significant, I think we can safely assume that if well-qualified local medics. judging from what they see in their homes, offices, consulting rooms, churches etc, think the epidemic has reached the 60% level or above, then that will be, if not accurate, at least more accurate than any official stats based only on serological tests. I stick to my belief that the 60%+ number is the best guide and that this is good news, not bad news, for travellers, however unfortunate and painful it has been for those affected: it means that herd immunity is quite possibly achieved already and that the peak has passed. And that's good for the economy of the island, too.Edited: 5 years ago "
"We came back from Grenada a week ago, staying at the Rex. The manager said that they had a high instance of the illness in July/August but hardly any now. They fog (spray) their resort regularly but even so, we still got bitten extensively - but did not get ill as a result. I would definitely take medical advice before travelling just to be sure."
"Today I asked 4 rheumatology specialists from a large teaching hospital in the UK whether any of them had treated a case of chikungunya arthritis...one had, in an Indian guy who had returned from India."
"Dear MoonsterIn your previous posts you have stated clearly that there is no treatment for ""chick"" other than supportive; You have stated that you do not advocate that Grenada or the UK or any other country should waste money by testing for it - a view which I find very strange coming from a medical professional. If tests and research are not conducted how can a disease or virus be tracked and potential protection or treatments be identified?.However given that you have stated there is no possible treatment and it is a waste of money to even test, why would you expect that people would waste their, and specialists, time and money seeking impossible treatment from a rheumatology specialist?. I fail to see the point of the information in your last post unless you are trying to argue that ""Chick"" only exists in India;Edited: 5 years ago "
"""If you think you have chikungunya in the uk, your gp will immediately refer you to the london or liverpool tropical diseases hospitals, nowhere else."" You are assuming that your GP has (a) heard of chikingunja (b) knows it is notifiable (c) doesn't suggest symptom based management initially and (d) when symptoms persists considers referral to London or Liverpool. I think the more likely scenario is that your GP would refer you to your local rheumatologist with ?reactive arthritis ?cause.""I fail to see the point of the information in your last post unless you are trying to argue that ""Chick"" only exists in India;"" I have in no way suggested that Chick only exists in India. Infact if you actually read my previous posts you will see that I am not debating that Chick isn't in the Caribbean, just the extent of the problem which you subscribe to. Indeed the general feeling I have from these discussions is that you all favour anecdotal evidence. You are quite happy when another poster states that one Grenada doctor claims that 65% of people have had it, you are quite happy with Bob's comments that they have had to set up special clinics to deal with the massive aftermath of this supposed epidemic, but my equally non-evidence hearsay based comment stating that no cases seen at a large UK teaching hospital is not acceptable. That is simply because you are believing what you want to believe - you want to believe that there is a massive epidemic, and so you will take that evidence as fact and anything else is just garbage. You have chosen to dismiss my experience of overreporting because that does not fit in with your belief system. Daily Mail anyone? Additionally with regards to my comments about the cost of testing. The NHS is a finite source - would you rather the money be spent on treatment for a potentially curable cancer, or on testing for a condition for which knowing the result of that test is probably not going to change your management. And given Bob's comments about the sensitivity of this test, it seems even more of a waste of money."
"Bob I find it extremely offensive that because someone doesn't share your view that they are trolling. Perhaps I simply come from a different knowledge and experience base than you, and one that you don't really want to listen to. You seem to like to twist people's words and I am in know way suggesting that any doctor would knowingly break the law, but for you to think that everu doctor, GP or other, knows every symptom of every disease, particularly rare ones, is completely unrealistic. Many will simply not have heard of it. I am also not suggesting not providing appropriate supportive treatment to someone who is symptomatic, but it remains that for the majority of people this is a short lived illness, and confirming it at that stage will not change the management from symptomatic to curative."
"Well, I like a fight as much as the next man. Moonster, I also found your approach bizarre. Firstly, you write a glowing review of the hotel in the main review section, including how much all your guests loved it and then later, on here, you slip in the fact that one of them caught ChikV. On the basis of your personal experience that one out of (I think you said) 28 people caught it, you proceed to generalise that as if it were of equal value to the widespread belief based on the experience and testimony of people who live there and have lived through what quite clearly has been an epidemic, that around 65% of people have had it. So it is your one experience against many, including highly qualified and involved local medical personnel. Then there's a whole load of implied stuff from you, on which you can't be pinned down but I am with Bob, the implications are clear.Remember this: the OP was asking about talking a person who has had cancer treatment and is quite possibly immunosupressed. The aim is to help the OP make a good decision for that person. To do that we need to work with imperfect evidence in the light of the lack of accurate data due to the low rate of serological testing. So, were I the OP I would go on the basis of the testimony of reliable and informed locals who have spent the entire year there, rather than someone who is, with all respect, in a honeymoon glow of affection having spent a week or two there.We recently had to take the same decision as the OP. We gave our friend and her oncologist all the evidence we were able to gather including the private opinions of extremely highly qualified local medical staff and of very reliable permanent residents of the island and on that basis it was decided that she should not visit for the meantime. We ourselves will visit. As I have repeatedly stated above, the epidemic, for that it undoubtedly was, seems to be tailing off now and the risks of infection are falling. But contend that the lack of accurate serological data means that one simply cannot acknowledge the existence of an epidemic that has been blindingly obvious to anyone who has chosen to look, is IMHO not likely to do any favours to the OP."
"Timbo - I have never said that any of our party got Chik, because none of them did. At this point I would like to quote myself ""Will you definitely get it, no - assuming that Alfred was there with his partner, of 28 people that spent 1-2 weeks in Grenada recently, 1 got it, 27 didn't."" The Alfred I was referring to it is the one that intermittently joins in this conversation and also spend 2 weeks at Spice Island - so 26 of my party, no one got it, Alfred and perhaps is partner (I do not know who he was with, he could have also been with 25 other people for all I know) - 1 got it. Again I reiterate my point about belief systems that you are not happy to accept my non-evidence based statistics, but you are happy to accept other peoples equal hearsay because it fits in with what you want to believe. Futhermore, it is important, as I have said many times, that you interpret this hearsay correctly, the risk for someone that spends 1-2 weeks on the island in a 5* hotel next to the beach is not the same as some who lives in the rainforest next to a stagnant swamp.I also agree with you that the OP needs proper advice, hence my directing her to the link from the foreign office for the appropriate current advice, which has been agreed and published following review from medical experts with knowledge in this field. I think we have all quite nicely demonstrated that the information obtained from a tripadvisor forum is about as accurate as that in the Daily MailAnd I'd like to point out that just because it was my honeymoon does not change my level of knowledge and interpretation. You have no knowledge of my background and experience of the carribean and the fact that you suggest that I am any less qualified to give an opinion because I got married recently is absolutely pathetic. I quote TimboLondon in reply to another post: ""I also have had a very happy trip to SI, have stayed elsewhere on the island and also have a home in the Caribbean. So I feel about as qualified as you to have an opinion"". Well if that is the criteria for giving an opinion, I would say I am at least equal if not above you on that stakes. Finally, I would like to quote another frequent poster to this discussion: ""Its prevalent throughout the Caribbean now, actually its not a terrible infection, but if your health is compromised take professional advice. The symptoms / effects are well known.""I am happy to continue discussing this for as long you wish."
"Ok, so you'll all be pleased to know that I have actually managed to find some published data. From the Pan American Health Organisation - www.paho.org/hq/index.php…So up to week 41 of the year (27th October 2014), the total number of suspected and confirmed CHIK in Grenada was 2852. This gives an incidence of 2593/100,000 people = 2.6% of people.So there you go, the official figures (funny that my 1 in 28 or 3.5%, so not far off)."
"I apologise for mis-reading your earlier post and deriving from it the inaccurate information that it was a member of your party that became infected - and I am genuinely pleased that at an event as wonderful as your wedding, not one of your guests was affected. I also agree that for the majority of people it is not a terrible infection though, for a significant minority, actually it is pretty nasty: my friend who was there in September and contracted it is still having problems and she is, trust me, no push over.I think where we disagree, to try to return this to the positive, is on the question of evidence. I had an argument a few months ago with an oncologist friend of mine on this very point. His view was if something is not proven, it is not worth talking about it as if it were true. My point, based on Karl Popper's view of scientific proof, is that whether something is proven or not is an entirely different matter from whether it is true. There are lots of true things that are not proven. We cannot speak of them as definitively true until they are proven (or subjected to the the test of falsifiability as Popper would have it) but we can speak of them as being true for practical purposes. The tobacco industry was able to get away for many years with claiming that smoking was not proven to cause cancer, because definitive truth proved elusive.Thus the contention that the outbreak of Chik in Grenada has been large enough to qualify as an epidemic, whilst theoretically falsifiable by global serology, is not falsifiable in practical terms because of economic constraints. So we will never be able to prove the contention that it was an epidemic but, crucially to the logic of it, nor will be able to prove the contention that it was not. They are both hypotheses. And in the absence of proof, we have to go on evidence, which will necessarily be largely anecdotal. Which brings me to the piece I originally quoted, from Dr Francis Martin, who estimated in September that close to 60% of the population had had it and that it had therefore reached epidemic proportions. Some things to note about this:1) Dr Martin is the Ministry of Health's Director of Primary care.2) He is not the only local medical expert to believe roughly the same thing3) His opinion chimes very closely with the straw poll I have taken of the people I know who live thereFrom my POV, therefore, and in the absence of the practical possibility of proving the epidemic hypothesis, let's just say that I think it a pretty sensible thing to regard as true, or very likely true.As I have tried to make clear, I think this is not without a 'silver lining' benefit to Grenada. I am extremely sympathetic to the sufferings of all those affected and to whatever degree of damage it has done to the economy. But it looks as if the epidemic/outbreak has peaked, herd immunity quite likely having been reached, and that this means that the tail-off period will coincide with and be facilitated by the end of the rainy season. Thus neatly fitting in with the start of high season for tourists. That's why I will be going myself, why I think most people without pre-existing health conditions will choose to go, and I am glad for that. It's a fabulous island with wonderful people.You are quite right to suggest that a 5* hotel such as SI on the beach (as opposed to a rainforest/swamp) improves the odds even further. You are also right that it is an amazing hotel - anyone who can afford it should try it at least once; it is one of the very best places I have ever stayed."
"Timbo - I glad we agree on a couple of things ;p I hope that you have a great chikingunja free trip to Grenada. Quite frankly, I'd rather be risking chikingunja in Grenada than in the UK rain!Edited: 5 years ago "
"Dear Moonster While you may ""rather be risking chikingunja in Grenada than in the UK rain"" I can assure you that if get the virus and the lingering pain you may well change your opinion.Please do not insult my intelligence again by telling me that the ""management"" should be to take painkillers as it will be short lived. I personally met 3 people in Grenada who had been infected months earlier, but continued to suffer repeat flare ups of the feet and joint problems that were so severe they could not walk unaided for a couple of days during our stay.As you state I have only occasionally joined this discussion, specifically because you have made numerous wildly inaccurate assumptions about my beliefs and opinions and how I form those opinions, and even wildly inaccurate assumptions on my own experiences. I could list them here but there is little point as it would be of no benefit to other readers especially as you seem intent on having the last word on any minor topic.I am also insulted by your comments in post 50 above comparing me or my views to the Daily Mail, especially as that comparison was based on your own incorrect assumptions.You state above that ""the information obtained from a tripadvisor forum is about as accurate as that in the Daily Mail "". You must therefore include your own posts in that view. If that is your view, I also find it strange that you yourself ask direct advice on Tripadvisor as to which hotel or location to use prior to your own trips.My view of what is a good hotel will be very different to that of an 18 year back packer or of a 60 year old multi millionaire. The purpose of Tripadvisor is to allow individuals to post their own opinions and experiences. It is the responsibility of other users to consider and make their own choices and there should be no question of one reviewer being right or wrong.A previous comment in this thread stated that one of my observations was ""WRONG"". As that reviewer had stated that he had left the island, and certainly was not in my hotel during the period to which my observation of fact was made, it is impossible for that reviewer to state that my review was factually ""WRONG"". I would accept if a reply had been posted to say that the reviewer did not have the same experience during his stay but I do not accept the accusation of being ""WRONG""; My hotel review was deleted by Tripadvisor as a result.I will not post on this thread again and would be grateful if you do not post in return to say ""Goodbye"" as you sarcastically did to John G in post 36 of this thread.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Alfred, it is funny that you repeatedly say you are not commenting on this thread but seem to keep coming back, so I wonder who it is that actually wants the last word? I am happy to just continue having a conversation, share views and experiences about this, some others want to make it aggressive. Indeed I do state ""rather be risking chikingunja in Grenada than in the UK rain"" because of what I believe the risk to be. Ultimately your view is biased by the fact you got Chik, and mine if biased by the fact that I didn't. I am intelligent enough to realise that, sadly some other posters on this forum might not. Every time I travel I have to make a decision about the risks of travelling to that area including disease, crime, traffic accidents, altitude sickness etc etc, and my weight of decision on this is that I would still travel to Grenada. Yes I might change my mind if when I go back I get Chik, and are one of the unlucky small percentage to have long lasting effects. ""the information obtained from a tripadvisor forum is about as accurate as that in the Daily Mail "". You must therefore include your own posts in that view."" Yes I am more than happy for you to include my comments in that, as just like everyone else's they are anecdotal experience based on an ""n"" of very small. I often browse the Daily Mail to get an understanding of the general publics knowledge of healthcare topics, and this forum would fit in perfectly with most of their reporting. ""My view of what is a good hotel will be very different to that of an 18 year back packer or of a 60 year old multi millionaire. The purpose of Tripadvisor is to allow individuals to post their own opinions and experiences. It is the responsibility of other users to consider and make their own choices and there should be no question of one reviewer being right or wrong."" I absolutely agree with this comment, and would not take one reply to a thread or a single review as gospel. I have never suggested anyone should not make their own choices or opinions, I have just presented another side of the story, which you seem to be so vehemently opposed to that you keep coming back to fight it with more information which has no more fact in it than my facts - it is all opinion."
My oncologist has recommended cancelling trip to DR because of Chikungunya.
"Hi I was one of 6 who visited Grenada in September had a great holiday , we soon heard about chick virus many hotels etc short of staff due to chick vivus on returning. Home after 3 days 2 of us came down with it inc me it really. Hit me for 6 in bed for 3 days a week of work blood tests confirmed. Chick virus and I have to say I still suffer with pain in my joints hands feet at times symptoms. Can last 12 months Ps I think the Caribbean try to cover the truth up belive me its not nice"

"I have been lurking in the backround for a while following this post. I think it is a very important thread for travelers to Grenarda and I would like to keep it on the top, but Moonster has brought up a point that is often lost on TA, you are only expressing opinions. When you are posting on here it doesn't matter if you are a doctor, lawyer or government official. On here it is just your opinion. Continue the discussion about chicken ( and dengue for that matter) but remember this is not a legal hearing but a opinion forum"
"Can you advise regarding the current status of chikinguna disease in Grenada. I am thinking about going to Grande Anse, staying at Blue Horizons for 10 days, and have not seen any recent posts concerning the outbreak. I have rheumatoid arthritis, and I understand is a high risk category for the disease, is it worth the risk, or should I forgo vacations in the Caribbean. Any feedback would be appreciated."
"I am concerned about a tourist coming to the island, not the local population. What is the status of measures being used to reduce the mosquito population that carries the disease? I will be coming down in late May, isn't that the start of the rainy season? Is it sufficient to use mosquito repellant sold in Canada, I.e. Deep Woods Off, or do you need to wear long pants and long sleeves? As I said I have rheumatoid arthritis, taking many meds including Plaquinil & Methotextrate. Am I being overly worried, or is it best to be safe than sorry, as I understand the symptoms can be debilitating."
"Mel I would suggests you speak with your specialist. We spent two month on Barbados (which also had the chik outbreak) wore OFF most days and always when we went on the bus system and going into town. We did not wear long sleeves or long pants. Each of us had some bites but not sure if they were mosquito, no-see-um or sand fly bites. The marks left did not look like the marks left from the mosquitoes we have at home. We saw two mosquitoes in two months, both dead and both not the species that carries chick or dengue. The herd immunity effect has been established and the incidence of new cases in Barbados at least is *way* down. I would be cautious, wear OFF, only leave open screened windows and doors, burn 'PIC' and use spray if sitting out in the evening but don't but don't overly worried. Your chances of becoming infected are *much* less now (or this spring) than last year. Enjoy your holiday."
I'm at the end of a ten day trip at LaLuna and there are very few mozzies around. We wear spray and are careful with doors and screens but I have only had one proper bite all the time we've been here and there is no talk of new infections for many weeks now. They call it Chiken-gone-now. IMHO the risk still exists but at such a low level that it is part of the background risk of being anywhere. Herd immunity has done its thing.
"Ps was here in January too, it rained a lot and there were more bugs, but I escaped the dreaded chik then...."
