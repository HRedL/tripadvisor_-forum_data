"Those living in Rome, how is the situation regarding Coronavirus? I learnt that the number of cases have gone up to 150 from 3 cases in 3 days. I read in the New York Times, that in the Lombardy region, 10 towns were locked down after a cluster of cases suddenly emerged in Codogno, southeast of Milan. Veneto region is also affected. I have not read anything about Rome. We have bookings to arrive in Rome in 2 weeks. Is it safe in Rome? Are any cases reported in Rome as yet?"
"I understand you are worried about a Italy and the Virus, but please understand that no one here can predict the future. We simply can not tell how this will go and what precautions the government will take. I hope their will be just one post that will cover the situation and not try to post in every city forum."
"Obviously Michael M is right, none can predict future, it is even possible an outbreak in Rome, but it is possible in New York City or Minneapolis too.Until now in Rome there have been two cases a few weeks ago, a couple of chinese tourists. He has fully recovered and she is recovering, she is no more in life threatening danger."
See this for facts in the northhttps:/…105692991There are other discussions in the Italy forum.
The simple answer is know one knows .its a impossible question to answer
I'm due there March 15-20. I'm about to cry at the thought of having to cancel. I'm just so hyped!
Same here..this is incredible. Will be coming for 2 weeks and also doing a cruise during that time..and traveling with kids. I hope the cases stay contained in that area. Othereise we risk being out alot of money we saved for this trip weve bren planning for a year.
"Joining in just to commiserate with others in this situation. My family and I are set to leave for Rome on March 13. We are only in the Rome/Naples area, so not in the currently impacted places. And I realize that though things could spread to Rome, they could also spread to Denver (where I live) or places within the US I regularly travel for work. I'm not canceling anything at this point - but I'm keeping my eye on the news. I'm also well aware that my airline might eventually make the choice for me. Good luck, all! And I wish Italy success in containing what they already have and being done with the virus!"
My country has now advised against any travel to Italy. I will be cancelling my flights
"Also planning to leave the US on March 15, arriving in Rome. Will leave for Munich March 18 and return home March 22. Fingers crossed things stay alright and we don't get quarantined on the way home!"
"For U.S. citizens, here's the latest from the embassy:https:/…"
"I am in Rome at present and the situation is quite normal. Unfortunately one had to expect that abroad one would talk about virus ""in Italy"", but If a virus is detected 500 km North, usual life goes on; it's like a fire at 2 km from home. I understand some fears, but nobody can know what happens in the future. One just should get informated always paying attention to the zones and not generically to ""Italy"", without panic and sticking to facts and to evidences."
Maybe I’m wrong but i cannot imagine the US suspending travel to Italy.
Maybe not to Italy but they certainly could from Italy as they did with China.

If that were the case then they wouldn’t allow us to fly there knowing that they wouldn’t let us come back
"TheBourbonKid - I hope you follow up and let us know how your travels go. I have a layover in London, so I will be impacted by how the US, UK, and Italy handle things."
kay2626 (Post #17)Have you been following the news? People were allowed to board a cruise ship but were later prevented from disembarking said cruise ship. The President of the US has banned those who have travelled thru China from entering the US. I won’t get political but common sense tells us that anything and everything is possible with closing our borders.
"Sure, no problem!"
Just because you arrive doesn’t mean you will be able to return. The airlines can choose to cease flights out of a country that has widespread cases. And who is “they?”
Agreed... but we are not traveling to China. At this point it’s too soon to speculate but it would have to be pretty wide spread. And i have friends that were in China 2 weeks ago and as Americans were allowed to fly back. They were asked to self quarantine for 14 days in their homes. I have a friend whose been in Thailand for 3 weeks and is flying back tomorrow with no issues
"Re #14 & 17 - Not following your logic at all. Are you suggesting the US government won't allow travel into Italy if flights from Italy to the US are curtailed? (Which, of course, has not yet happened and may well not ever happen.)There is currently nothing the US government is doing to prevent a US citizen from traveling to China. Only a strong advisory to ""avoid non-essential travel"" and the difficulty of finding commercial routes. (they do exist....) Getting back into the US (from China) has some barriers."
"So far the situation in under control. Looks like they managed to isolate some virus enclaves in the north of Italy.In Rome we just have 2 Chinese tourists at the hospital. They have been there for the past 17 days e no one else got taken to the hospitals. Many fake alarms but nothing serious in Rome so far. All the tampons made in the city (more than 3k) were negatives. Please make your Own opinion reading Italian newspapers (English version) like www.repubblica.it or www.corriere.it I live here, so if you need other info please get back to me"
"If US isn't banning travel to/from S. Korea or Japan as of yet, then I don't see them banning Italian flights unless there is a huge expansion in Italy.Edited: 1:50 pm, February 24, 2020 "
"Going in 4 1/2 weeks, and no I’m not worried. From what I’ve read a lot of people are going to get the virus and never know. And like the flu those that pass away unfortunately have, not all, been the elderly and/or with health issues."
We are traveling in 4 1/2 weeks as well. I’m not concerned
Good article on this topic from thelocal.it: https://www.thelocal.it/20200224/should-i-ca…
"Please be aware that there are many discussions on the subject in Italy forums. Go here to seehttps:/…ShowForum-g187768-i20-Italy.htmlhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g18…The problems are currently confined to northern Italy, where there are comprehensive official restrictions set by regional governments from the French border to the Slovenia border and south to La Spezia, Bologna, Rimini.https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g18…"
"Since thousands of people from Lombardy work in Switzerland and pass the border any day, you should avoid northern Italy and Southern Switzerland before Lazio."
"Im scheduled to fly out to Rome this Saturday. And while i do have to be careful about my respiritory health due to asthma i have no intentions of cancelling my trip. I happen to live in the city/county as the gentleman who reportedly was the first case of coronavirus in the states. So far he is the only 1 in my area. I understand that Rome currently has 2 known cases and the persons are quarantined and being cared for by Doctors.I took the time to listen to a public health hearing about Coronavirus. Not to minimize anyones fears or concerns but; they urged the community not to ""freak out"" and instead to educate yourself and take precautions. Which btw is similar to what the us center for disease control says as well. And as such i will keep en eye on reports and will be traveling with lots of Clorox wipes, hand sanitizer, handwashing every chance i get and doing a lot less eye/face touching. What i wont be doing is canceling my trip or worrying about something that may or may not happen.Good luck to all those with travel plans. I hope people dont feel they have to cancel their plans and wish everyone safe and healthy travels."
"Further to #32, this is current CDC advice, necessarily cautioushttps:/…coronavirus-italypoppyphlox, against the highly unlikely prospect of any delays, be sure you have abundant medical supplies. And scripts. A flu vaccination is useful, not because it will stop a new virus but because this has been a bad flu season in Europe as well as north America. Avoiding the flu is good for the immune system."
"After much thought, I called the Delta Platinum line and cancelled our tickets to Rome. We also cancelled our Hilton hotel booking and also all viator tours. We were going for a vacation and to relax but with the sustained spread of disease and as yet no idea the source of the virus there is likelihood of more infections. While this is affecting the northern parts of Italy, it could well spread south to Rome. We are going to rebook to a South American country where there is summer. The flu and other similar viruses are active in the winter. Best wishes and safe travels for those who are going to go ahead for their vacation. Hopefully in the near future we can visit this wonderful city and country."
"We leave on the 6th, we think we will kill our Rome Trip. we have a flight to London and then another to Rome. Our concern is not so much getting sick but getting stuck or having everything get cancelled on us. We will be out about $400 but we may be anyways. Wondering how the weather is in Cornwall this time of year."
Cornwall ... they'll be pleased to see you!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9a3pzVJs90just google cornwall weather [month]
"""Is Rome Safe? ""Seriously? In an age where internet access makes factual information available almost instantly, why would anyone ask such a question and expect a serious answer? - particularly asking a bunch of tourists rather than medical experts.Here is an answer.Yes, a stranger on a forum said Rome is perfectly safe! , You can confidently visit and be immune from all Viruses, Theives, Robbers, Sexual predators and ZTL cameras.Have a great holiday!"
This virus could spread anywhere at this point and affect anyone.
"Allgoodnamesgone - with regret, I can tell you that Cornwall is wet, cold and windy!"
I believe the Dutch government is now advising non travel to Italy.We are planning to arrive in Rome on Monday 2nd for a weeks stay.But the way the virus is spreading our trip maybe cancelled - now awaiting foreign office advise.
"UK Foreign Office is advising UK citizens this morning that it remains safe to travel to Italy, but that:1) If you travel close to any of the affected towns in Northern Italy you must self isolate when you return; and2) If you travel to Northern Italy (defined as anywhere Nirth of Pisa), you must self-isolate when you return IF you have any symptoms.On this basis, and in the absence of the individual showing any symptoms, the UK appears to consider that travel to and from Rome is safe at present."
It may change over the next few days.All depends on whether they have contained the virus in the north.Fingers crossed and all that.
"I'm a scientist and I have an international scientific meeting (not cancelled yet) at FAO headquarters in Rome, 9-13 March. I'm travelling from Chile, and after Rome I need to go to Sweden. All my tickets are booked (I dont do this but Goverment). Even if the meeting is cancelled, I cant cancell as I need to proceed to Sweden. It's a very tense situation, but I hope Italian authorities contain everything."
"As a scientist you would read that leading epidemiologist are saying that containment at this point has passed. And 80% show mild to no symptoms. The Avian Flu of 97 was much more lethal. Be safe as you would most likely not put yourself in a position to be in a sketchy area of any big city. Heck more people die from gunshots in Chicago yet is there a ban to travel to Chicago. All I’m saying is read and inform yourself through scholarly articles and not any message boards, including TripAdvisor."
"#37 you are obviously annoyed by the original posters question. I can understand that he/she (like me) is concerned about an upcoming trip and is trying to get an idea of how things stand locally. Maybe it is better to consider being kind and ignore posts that annoy you moving forward. It’s nice to ask a question without fear of ridicule.Edited: 7:36 am, February 25, 2020 "
Hi - there has been 3 cases in Rome / Lazio . They were the first ones. But now there are some cases emerging in Tuscany and Sicily. Please use google for news. There is 270 cases in italy at the moment. https:/…
I’m also in the same boat. Wondering if we are really going to enjoy Italia as it should
I’m on the same boat but the question is Would Italy be enjoyable like always or it will not be at all so all that money gone to waste? I’m leaving to Rome March 8th for a week and I’m having doubts about the trip
"When u get to Rome can you please post and see how things are? Like the museum are open, restaurants, etc? Is it still Italy or some version of it.Thanks"
To add a little humor - I had re-read Dan Brown's Angels and Demons because of the setting ahead of our trip...now I'm thinking I also need to re-read Inferno for the context.
"#49 - in Rome everything is open and going on normally. Many links above have said this but here again: it is only 10 little towns in northern italy that have been shut off as a precaution. The normal flu is far more widespread than the corona virus and has killed more people (over 200 just in the past week). Wash your hands, don’t touch your face when out and about and don’t kiss or shakehands with people - these are the very effective precautions one needs."
"We just came back from Rome yesterday after a 3 day breakA few folk were wearing masks but they were still a minority, the place was heaving with folk over for the rugby & absolutely nothing at all was closed anywhere"
"Post #49. Could you reciprocate? I have just read that this winter 12,000 Americans have died of flu and 300,000 have been hospitalised. Are you all wearing face masks? Are your museums and restaurants still open? Keep some perspective."
"Johna0724: I risk to be not original but the situation is as just described: some small areas are affected in the North but Italy is large and in Rome everything is quite normal, school, work, public transport, rubgy matches, wooden spoon for Italy... everything as usual."
"Beauchamp,Things are closing in Italy. Nothing is closing in the US. That is the difference."
"Well, let's talk about difference, I agree. But also about difference bewteen areas of Italy, and not just in terms of ""Italy"" as if it were a village. And this is the forum about Rome."
"Agreed. The worry is that it takes time to get to Rome. And if things start closing during that time, we might arrive there to places that are closed."

"...If that were the case then they wouldn’t allow us to fly there knowing that they wouldn’t let us come back..yes that could happen. Things change day to day. They don't have a running tally of who went to Italy. You could get stuck or quarintinedEdited: 12:32 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"These kind of things don't usually worry me, but we've decided to postpone booking any foreign trips this year (a return to Rome was planned for the Autumn, plus an April trip elsewhere), at least until things are better understood. We feel it's the safe and sensible thing to do; too many enclosed spaces with people from multiple areas whilst travelling. It just feels too risky. Foreign travel is a luxury and a privilege, and the greatest risk in this instance is the potential danger you pose to others by putting your own pleasure over sensible precautions. But regardless of how people view this, my best guess is that the decision will be taken out of most people's hands over the next few weeks. Fingers crossed I'm wrong on this though."
"Latest is that 280 cases and 10 deaths.So that is 72 new cases and unfortunately 3 deaths today.It shows that you have to check day to day if going to travel.Edited: 12:47 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"Important to point out that the three news deaths concern residents of Lombardy aged 83, 84 and 91. Of the total of 10 persons who have heretofore died, all or most had significant pre-existing medical conditions. Also important to note that Italy has a very high percentage of elderly residents, compared to the U.S,, for example.One key metric to watch is the RATE of increased contagion. This metric has been DECREASING in Italy over the past three days: from 100% to 50% to roughly 38% at the moment. That is an encouraging fact.By next week, and perhaps even sooner,, we should have a pretty good idea of whether the contagion has been adequately blunted"
may need to change again . . . . .
"I have a trip to Rome scheduled for the end of October, and unless things become like an episode of The Walking Dead in Europe, we're still planning to go. We're continuing on to the UK afterwards, so yes, we do have to watch various governments sites for warnings and travel restrictions a month or so before our departure; however, as many have already said, strains of the flu in the past have been far deadlier.I think the 24 hour news cycle is just freaking people out unnecessarily."

"deleting duplicate post, sorry!Edited: 5:00 pm, February 25, 2020 "
"For May that makes no sense at all. By then, either the virus will have petered out (unlikely), or mutated into a milder form (possible), or have spread all over the place (including the US, which unlike Europe doesn’t have centrally managed and mostly free health services and hence is almost certainly hiding undiagnosed cases). The fact that there is a small cluster of cases in northern Italy now has no bearing whatsoever on where the centres of the outbreak will be in three months time. All it would take is one carrier to pass through or return to your home town and you might be safer on holiday. The biggest risk is the travel itself - planes are a more risky environment than any destination you might pick, other than possibly the originating province of China."
#66 see thishttps:/…coronavirus-italyThe reason people are being advised to seek support by telephone is that they should not go to emergency departments or to doctors offices. A number of emergency departments have been closed because they were treating people before realising they had COVID-19 and staff have been infected. Dangerous for people of unknown hygiene condition and unknown medical condition to make crowds in medical premises as well as other events and places ruled out in northern Italy at least for the rest of February. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g18…Main discussionhttps:/…105711970
Did you just say US is hiding undiagnosed cases
Hi all..Im asian .. will travel to rome this april..Saw the news some racism treatment in europe recently to asian due to corona virus..Is it safe for asian to travel to rome for now?
Hi I am due to fly to Rome tomorrow - would you safe it is still ok to visit?
"YesAs I said above, your biggest risk is on the plane, regardless of its destination. And even that risk is tiny."
"Not deliberately - I said undiagnosed.But use your common sense.In the UK where I am, going to the doctor is free. Going to the hospital is free. And there are mobile virus testing points being set up, which are free, where I can go and get my test result a day or two later.In the US the guy from Miami who went and got tested has just received a bill for thousands of $. And he just had ordinary flu. You’re telling me that in such circumstances everyone who feels they might have the symptoms is going for a test?Further, the US results are being delayed because many of the tests are still having to be mailed to Atlanta. A lot of the test kits being used by various states don’t seem to be working well and some states say they are producing incorrect results. Yet as of this morning the US reported cases have risen to fifty three confirmed.Give it a month, we’ll all be at risk, wherever we live.The biggest risk of travel is being confined for hours on a plane, ship or train with tons of other people from all over. And the risk of the virus still being on surfaces from the previous batch of passengers.The second biggest risk is how you behave - not washing hands, etc.The marginal risk of being in any particular town in the world, over staying at home, is in itself tiny.Edited: 3:48 am, February 26, 2020 "
"Latest updateSeveral European countries have announced their first coronavirus cases, with all appearing to be linked to the growing outbreak in Italy.Austria, Croatia and Switzerland said the cases involved people who had been to Italy, as did Algeria in Africa.The first positive virus test has been recorded in Latin America - a Brazilian resident just returned from Italy. Italy has in recent days become Europe's worst-affected country, with more than 300 cases and 11 deaths. But its neighbours have decided closing borders would be ""disproportionate"".Health ministers from France, Germany, Italy and the EU Commission committed to keeping frontiers open at a meeting on Tuesday as new cases of the virus emerged throughout Europe and in central and southern Italy. ""We're talking about a virus that doesn't respect borders,"" said Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza."
Thank you
Just to point out that the percentage of deaths of those who even catch the virus is very low and those deaths seem restricted to the very elderly and/or already sick so I don't think the average traveller should unduly worry.
I agree with post #80 my fiancé and i were just discussing this as we are set to travel on March 27. As a healthcare worker i am not concerned about getting the virus i am more concerned about things not functioning in a normal capacity and museums restaurants etc being closed. The uncertainty as to what will happen over the next door weeks before our trip is what is bothering me the most. We will be able to go? And even more upsetting is that I’m sure Alitalia will not refund our money for our tickets. If we were flying on a US based airline and they chose to discontinue flights to Italy then we would be refunded but i doubt that will be the case with Alitalia.
"Paul - though some are worried about catching the coronavirus specifically, some of us have other concerns - particularly how a city/country reacts to an outbreak. In my house we're relatively young and healthy, and I've seen the break down in deaths by age and we'd be silly to be overly concerned about that. The real concern for travelers, I think, is the potential reaction of our country and the countries we travel to when new outbreaks occur. Are we ok with being trapped outside our own country? Will places be open if the outbreak spreads to Rome? Would we want to be quarantined for 2 weeks upon arrival home? That sort of thing. I realize that the next outbreak could just as well be my home city in Colorado as Rome - but it's different to be home during these things than to be in thousands of miles away."
"While everything is OPEN in Rome, and nothing is closed due to the Coronavirus situation, Italian media today reports one exception:Effective immediately and for a ""provisional"" period of time, ALL CATACOMBS IN ITALY, wherever located, will remain CLOSED, due to the limited spaces, limited air circulation, and high humidity present.It should be stressed that the closures are merely precautionary in nature, nothing more.Edited: 8:41 am, February 26, 2020 "
"#77 that is not actually true. first cases would in all probability be travelers. Now 91% of the us population have health care so. probability is not in your favor. But we really should get back to the issue at hand. P.S. I support change in US Health Care, just don't buy that in the US it would go unreported initially."
"Sorry if I repeat that this is the forum about ROME. The topic is called ""is ROME safe"". Rome IS safe today as if it was the latest days. No use spreading panic talking about areas of Italy some 500 km apart. In these days the affected areas have not changed. So, please stick to facts and don't use so important a forum to convey fear (and why not, prejudice).Hello Momcat, glad to meet you again. Unfortunately you are quite right, ignorance is the worst virus.Edited: 10:31 am, February 26, 2020 "
"#85. Regardless of distance, Coronavirus is a relevant and important topic of discussion on this board. People are here because they have booked (or are considering booking) a Roman holiday. Like it or not, there is a COVID-19 problem in Italy and the direction of travel (excuse the pun) is to minimise the congregation of large numbers of people. This will effect tourist hotspots generally, not just Rome. Re your thoughts on distance, please also note that Ireland RFU postponed its 6 Nations rugby game with Italy as a precautionary measure today, and postponement of other large event postponements are being considered, This is not being done out of ignorance or fear, but from precaution and knowledge about how viruses spread.Personally, I think there is a very strong argument for people to minimise unnecessary travel at this time - whether it's to Rome or elsewhere."
Question: Has anybody come back recently from and can tell us really how things out there? Can we really experience Rome as it should or it will be a drag?
Can you let us know how it went?
"We were supposed to be going to Rome tomorrow morning for a week - I’ve been following this forum and was feeling a bit apprehensive (more about the panic/quarantine/home country reaction than the virus itself). Mask and hand sanitizer prices have skyrocketed here, but we were getting prepared for the flight. However this afternoon I had an email to say my return flight had been cancelled (5th March). Because of this, we decided to cancel the whole trip - we were eligible for a full refund on the flights and got a refund on Airbnb. Like others here, we were concerned we’d not be able to have such a nice time and would rather postpone to a future date when hopefully things have settled down. Now I’m trying to get refunds for Vatican, colosseum, train tickets with Trenitalia and Italo, Galeria Borghese and the Rome Opera. We’ll be a little out of pocket, but no doubt it’s the right decision to have made."
"Good decision, Connie. #89. Based on how things are ramping up, I'm guessing more flights will be cancelled, and/or people will incur other hassles/problems from their planned trips. This for example, just announced by Israel:The Israeli health ministry announced that Israelis returning from Italy would be required to go into quarantine at home for two weeks. Expanding its precautionary steps, the ministry said it was also now urging the public “to reconsider the necessity of flights abroad in general, beyond the required isolation upon return from specific countries”. (Source: The Guardian, 26 Feb.)"
Has anyone in Rome answered #73? The answer may be obvious to you but not to the person asking. Perhaps private message as well as forum response because the question has been buried.
"For local fact, if you go to #33 at https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g18…you will find links to the regional government of Lazio and determinations affecting Rome. For Rome news, the principal Rome newspaper is Il Messaggero. This is a link to the health section. https://www.ilmessaggero.it/salute/…Open with Chrome browser to be offered a translation."
"#89--since your trip was so soon, I feel you were wise to cancel and now can put your energies towards a wonderful trip sometime in the future....:). I do know many have spent a lot of money on trips (as well as hopes and dreams) and it is a difficult decision to be at such a loss and disappointment. But hopefully, there can be some return of expenses and most importantly, peace-of-mind and good health for all."
Well that was a good decision based on the refund you got. I assume lots of people will want the same but these airlines don’t like to loose money
"""Question: Has anybody come back recently from and can tell us really how things out there? Can we really experience Rome as it should or it will be a drag?""I'm very sorry but you have already asked this question and I - who AM in Rome - have already answered, taking my time to give you some useful information in your language. Believe or not, in Rome everything was and still is totally normal. The affected areas are NOT in Rome but in totally different areas of Italy, and they have not changed in the latest days. Italy is large ans what affects one area may not affect other areas. I'm really depressed reading that so many people go on talking about what they don't know and go on talking in terms of ""Italy"" as if it had the width of Monaco.I can't find what else to say. If you prefer to believe to nosense and you want to be told that Rome is in a hell, you won't be told it by me. I think I know the situation better than someone who likes to spread panic from their houses in other countries or other continents because of ignorance or prejudice. I prefer to tell the truth.P.S. Generally speaking. some thanks would not be disregarded."
"Besides quoting everything Aristofane wrote (I live in Rome as he does), I'd like to say that the situation, serious as it is, should be seen in real prospective. The total of the victims in whole Italy from the beginning of the epidemic is comparable of the one of the last gun-related massacre in the U.S., happened yesterday., but I've never read about a ban of the flights from/to America"
Until the UK government tells us we cannot travel then we will be arriving in Rome on Monday 2nd March for our 5 day stay.Just hope the weather is good......
"@AristofaneYou said: ""I think I know the situation better than someone who likes to spread panic from their houses in other countries or other continents because of ignorance or prejudice. I prefer to tell the truth.""Painting others as ignorant or prejudiced is an emotional response to a rational discussion here. The question being asked here is a valid one, and the answers being given are helpful. The Roman authorities have begun to put restrictions in place as precautionary measures against the potential spread of COVID-19. Are they ignorant and prejudiced in your book too? Please, let people discuss this rationally and make their own decisions about travel risks."
""" Please, let people discuss this rationally and make their own decisions about travel risks.""It's exactly I would tell too. Rationally, so basing on knowledge and on matters of fact. A matter of fact is that in Rome the situation is normal."
"""A matter of fact is that in Rome the situation is normal.""Actually, as a matter of fact, Rome is affected right now, so it's not 'normal'. We have already learned from this thread that the catacombs have been closed due to the conavirus threat, free museum day has been cancelled for the same reason, and at least one airline has been reported as cancelling return flight from Rome. I get your point that you believe there has been an overreaction by the Roman authorities on this (although you seem to blame outsiders and fake news for this - see other thread), but if you want to be factual, please present facts rather than your opinion. Facts don't care about your feelings!"
Go on spreading panic if you are pleased. I answered some questions basing on my direct and personal experience of the place where I live. Sorry if it is not enough to be believed.
"I absolutely believe you have strong feelings about this subject, but let's stick to the facts rather than unfairly blaming others for ""spreading panic"". The municipal authorities of Rome aren't 'spreading panic' by closing potential mass gatherings, I'm not 'spreading panic' by reporting these actions, and others on this thread are not ''spreading panic' by asking and answering questions'.

"@shuetz WWe leave March 21. I am not an RN but work in a hospital. I can't wait for my trip and I definitely will be diligent with hand washing as I would be while traveling anyway. I keep getting texts from friends asking if I am altering my trip. I tell them a firm ""No"". as long as my flight doesn't get canceled."
To #100To be fair if the airline in question is Easy Jet.....then thats an often occurrence for that airline and one reason I no longer use them.
"NorthWestUK1, I think no use going on you and me on this topic (if you want to go on by private messages, no objections).I just find curious that so often ""those living/who are in Rome"" are consulted, but when they do, then their contributions seem to be ignored if they don't confirm some earlier suspicions or if they don't dramatize enough. It's that what I would call ""emotional attitude"" and ""strong feeling"" about a topic, not mine own.Edited: 8:55 am, February 27, 2020 "
Yes. We just want to know what they have to say and compare to the media. We are not trying to offend anyone or cause any harm. Is a valid question to see how things are. Bottom line we are in this together because this virus there is not going to be a vaccine for at least a year per the US government. I hope other governments find a solution earlier than this. In the mean time let's keep cool and the communication flowing. Continuing with the discussion I see in cameras online that are lots of people on the streets so that's a good sing. I think they are tourist of course because they are just wondering around and taking pictures. But that just what I see
"I absolutely love the fact that people who are nowhere near Rome are so stubborn and eager to misinform others and even challenge the opinion of people who actually live here. There is no panic, the city is fine, stop listening to the alarmists. Of course you never know what might happen and when or if the virus might reach Rome or all of Europe really, but as of now anyone saying the city is going closer to lockdown is a moron."
"@johna0724: I understand that some prudential initiative, such as the closing of the catacombs or tno free entrance in the museums on the first sunday of March, taken at national or international level have impact on tourists going to Rome, but please believa us. The everyday life in the city is ABSOLUTELY the same as usual. Quarantine zone represents 0,01% of italian surface and 0,089% of italian population, and it is about 500 km from RomeEdited: 9:47 am, February 27, 2020 "
"We are due to leave from the US to Rome in a couple weeks, March 20. My worry is how altered the city will be due to the virus. Restaurants, museums, Vatican, etc.....and the possibility of problems getting back into US."
"I like your attitude johna0724, and concur completely about communication flow. We were in Rome last month (fab holiday, can't wait to return), and don't imagine it currently presents more risk than most other tourist destinations right now.The reason we're holding back on booking a return trip to Rome later this year as planned, is the same reason we've cancelled our Easter holiday to another destination: Just too much uncertainty everywhere, our main worries being the risks at airports/on planes and, above all, getting stranded somewhere because of a quarantine or flight cancellation. With every new announcement here in the UK and other countries (USA, Japan, Saudi Arabia, etc, etc), it does seem like those risks are increasing exponentially.Given what we know about the spread of the virus to date, surely there are also ethical issues around travel involved now?Edited: 10:20 am, February 27, 2020 "
"I think this is what I needed to hear! Thank you for your post. It's not a decision to make solely on the ""virus"", but everything that is going on because of it."
I find looking at the actual Live Cams of cities around Italy very helpful. You can see with your own eyes that life goes on as usual. https:/…italia.html
"#111 - I'm in your same boat. I actually feel my trips to Northern California coming up are more risky than going to Rome because I think at the moment the US is clueless the full extent of our exposure. But there are the other factors to consider as the world is in freak out mode. In addition to potential quarantines, flight cancelations, and closures of public spots (it's anyone's guess where the next ones will be), I fear people who choose to travel to places like Italy, South Korea, China etc. are going to be blamed for the upcoming outbreaks in other countries that are bound to happen. Personally, I would just go to Italy if it was me alone. I telecommute and could easily self-quarantine to make those around me feel better. My husband cannot work from home and has his own business. My son is in 3rd grade and has state testing soon after our arrival home. I'm super bummed, but if my husband is uncomfortable with the travel we will not go. Right now he said he's 90% sure we should cancel, but because everything is non-refundable we'll wait to take any action.I look to these forums not only to see the current state of Rome, but also to commiserate with fellow travelers in the same predicament that none of us expected when we booked our vacations. For many of us, it's not easy to find the time and/or money to take such trips often, and looking forward to travel is a daily motivator to get through our jobs and daily struggles. There is a lot of emotion attached to the decision, which I think is why people will ask the same questions repeatedly hoping for a different answer. Good luck to you all - whether you go to Rome, cancel, or reschedule. I'll be checking in :-)"
"In looking at the web cams i Rome i agree, it appears life is continuing as usual but then i happened to look at florcence’s Duomo web cam (i know this isn’t a Florence forum) because my upcoming trip consists of a few day’s there and i was upset to see how empty the area was"
"Becky416. Our situation is the SAME. I want to travel, but don't have lots of money. Rome has been on my bucket list, and I just booked the ticket after what I saw what happened to Kobe Bryant . Life is too short so I just went ahead and booked my ticket to take my fam. My wife is a school teacher, and I cannot work remote. My daughter is about to start college, and in the US that's really expensive so we BOTH need to have jobs while kids are in school. So, this is a predicament and yes there are FEELINGS attached to all of this and we just want to keep informed. Currently I plan to travel to Rome March 8th (non-refund tickets, and I call the airline everyday to ask about the situation). So, far the live cams are telling everything looks normal. I'm afraid more to the fact that coming back from Italy how people in the US will view us and treat us when we come back (specially my wife since she is a school teacher). All of us want to go, I'm the one that is 50% not sure. If the airline would budge I would honestly cancel. If they don't. I will go and have a blast for sure (alcohol will help me). Facts are that it seems that Italy is doing a good job to contain the virus, and the affected areas are 300 miles out, airplanes are the problem but I plan to wear mask during the flight if it helps the situation. Bottom line this thing is coming and we need right now to pretend we all have the flu and take measures (wash hands, hand sanitizers and fist bumps instead hand shakes)"
"With a VERY heavy heart, I just cancelled my March 15-20 trip to Rome. It's not only the 'virus', but the risk of quarantine and exposure in the airports and planes that just isn't worth it. Rome will be right there waiting for me! Ps. I had travel insurance, so I'm not out any money."
"# 116I feel your pain and anxiety. I suppose that the airlines are being extremely stingy and careful about allowing cancellations with refunds for selfish economic interests. If word gets out that they are generously refunding fares, many, many, many more cancellations would follow, because the first instinct of travelers is to be ""safe rather than sorry.""The Italian Government is now trying to backtrack in a variety of ways by getting out the word that the virus situation is not really as terrible as the media and social media are advertising. We have witnessed some truly shameful, sensationalistic and alarmist reporting of late.Museums, churches and theatres may indeed reopen in Lombardy and Veneto by next week (and according to the Governor of Lombardy, an official communication should come out by this Sunday). I am confident that if this comes to pass in Lombardy, it will happen in the other regions as well.In ROME, the ONLY sites actually closed, to my knowledge, are the CATACOMBS, which makes perfect sense in view of the cramped space, bad air circulation and high humidity present there. But everything else, including the pubs, bars and cafes into the night (so you can get a drink even at night!)The Italian leading newspaper LA REPUBBLICA has a new editorial today which alerts readers that a ""new virus"" has taken hold in Italy, called ""PAURAVIRUS"" which means ""Virus of Fear"". I encourage those anxious about traveling to read it in GOOGLE translation, because it is a truly moving, extremely provocative and introspective, almost philosophical in tone and content.https:/…"

"We are also due in March 23-31, but we decided to cancel our trip and be on the safe side."
"I'm booked for a 24 day holiday starting April 15 flying into Rome. I'm a solo healthy 41 year old, so I think I'll be looking at this in a different manner. I'm thinking/assuming large Chinese tour groups, older travelers, and so on, will be the bulk of future canceled trips. I personally think I'm going on this trip regardless (90% of my bookings are locked in). I still have 40 days to watch how things shake up, but other then the worst case scenario....quarantine, cancelled flights, and locked out towns, I think this will still be a great trip to experience with my specific scenario. Crowds might actually be manageable."
"@Aristofane I think is a problem relavant because is a side effect of visiting Rome. Remember this forum is for people traveling to Rome, and not living in Rome. So, we want to know about the whole experience: going to rome, hanging out in Rome and returning from Rome. You take offense to quick my friend. I want to hear about other US travelers are dealing with the situation to see if I can leverage from what they do."
"3 of us were due to arrive on the 5th of March but we decided to cancel ,we don't think Rome is not safe,mostly the flight to Rome and from it was the problem,maybe later we will visit again this great city."
"We’re due in Rome on Monday for a week. We’re simply following UK Foreign Office advice - they have not advised against travelling to Rome so, if that remains the same on Monday, we will travel as planned. If the Foreign Office advice changes, we will of course heed it. It is not helpful for people on this forum to begin impliedly criticising others for following their government’s advice, by querying whether travelling is “ethical”. Climb down from your pedestal, stop spreading unnecessary panic and and let people travel to wherever they want as long as they are free to do so, without judgment. All the best everyone, I hope everyone makes the decisions that are right for you ;)"

"Same situation as Becky416 and johna0724 - except my flight is to Rome mid April. It's further away than March, but I have gotten no trip planning done since all of this is still in the air. Is anyone flying Lufthansa? I see they are offering free rebooking for Northern Italy only. I did not get travel insurance and was looking into it but seems pointless now. Traveling with a group of 7 (2 of which are elderly, and 2 young children). :("
"I believe that it was you who began casting aspersions on others’ conduct by implying they were being unethical if they travel. That is unhelpful in the extreme. And perhaps not very ethical itself if people are already worrying. Please, direct me to my hypocrisy. Also, if you’ve cancelled your trip, why are you even still here?"
There is no value in bickering here. Or anywhere.
"I'm not going to argue with you, if you want to see the hypocrisy go back and reread what we've both written. If you can't see it, don't worry - I apologise.p.s. The 'shut up, why are you here' attack only demeans yourself. Let's be civil and allow people to express their thoughts."

"As an FYI, I’m in Rome now- arrived on Sunday and will be staying through to Monday. We were supposed to continue on to Venice yesterday and then to Milan, but Delta allowed us to change our flight to leave from Rome for free. As Aristofane and others have said, life is continuing on as usual here. I wouldn’t even know there was an outbreak up north if it wasn’t for the news... So, coronavirus may have spread here and we don’t know it yet. Or maybe it hasn’t. Who knows. My family and I are washing our hands regularly and using hand sanitizer more than usual. Otherwise, we’re carrying on as usual too. Best of luck to everyone making their decisions. Ps- Rome is February is perfection! What a nice change from the summer crowds and heat."
"can you keep us posted?I'm scheduled to go in few weeks with my famiy and very unsure as to what to do. going rome and south, was going to do few days in sienna as well."
We are going in a few weeks as well. Florence sienna Paris and Rome. As for now we are still going
"You can also monitor developments in ROME by consulting the dedicated Rome editions of these two leading Italian national newspapers:https://roma.corriere.it/https://roma.repubblica.it/?ref=RHHD-MLTHE CATACOMS IN ROME ARE ""PROVISIONALLY"" CLOSED AS A PURELY PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE AGAINST THE SPREAD OF CORONAVIRUS."

"I will be in a group of 7 who is flying out to Rome on the 3rd. We currently have no intention of cancelling. The concern is valid no doubt, but unless travel is strongly advised against by our government we will be going."
We’ve decided to cancel our Rome trip for March 13-21. Looks like Delta is now offering waivers for flights to Rome https://news.delta.com/update-delta-waives-t… Now I’m working on cancelling tours I had scheduled. Feeling sad but we just decided we wouldn’t enjoy the trip if we were worried about possible quarantine and other potential trip disruptions. Hopefully will make it to the Eternal City in 2021.
"We are planning to travel to Rome from March 6 - 13. I've been monitoring the situation carefully, and so far, there is no signs of any outbreaks near Rome. Right now, the US Department of State's travel advisory states, ""At this time, CDC does not recommend canceling or postponing travel to Italy"" (although the CDC does not recommend travel if you are elderly or have other health risks).Obviously, the situation may change by the time we leave next week. I'm a little concerned about flights being canceled due to many tourists deciding not to travel. On the other hand, I sort of selfishly look forward to Rome being less crowded than usual (with hope, obviously, that the COVID-19 outbreaks are contained and well-treated). So, unless the situation gets much worse, we still plan on enjoying our vacation."

It's further away than March, but I have gotten no trip planning done since all of this is still in the air. Is anyone flying Lufthansa? I see they are offering free rebooking for Northern Italy only""Sorry but it's quite logical, because in Rome there is no emergency and you are just expected to fly. If you don't want it's just your choice."
"I appreciate both the tourist and local perspective here - so thank you, Romans! I think sometimes we assume the tourist responders are doing the same tourist activities we plan to do - while people who live there probably don't do those things daily - so that might be why they're sometimes more well received. I'm still holding out hope my husband will agree to take this trip in 2 weeks - so I'll keep checking in - for the local and tourist perspective ;-)"
I do very much appreciate the information from those living in Rome. It's very helpful to put what were seeing on the news into perspective. So thank you.
"#147 - My coworkers are doing the same about me going to Rome on the 4th. I would recommend not letting their drama and highly unnecessary anxiety get in the way of your trip. What people don't understand is that if you have symptoms upon landing back in the US, the government won't let you go to work anyway, so she has absolutely no need to freak out. Maybe also point out to her that masks don't even help healthy people. They should only be used for people who are already sick and health workers. https:/…I'm still planning on going until the CDC says not to. I look forward to going back to my favorite city in the world and enjoying all the pasta and wine my body can take! Hope you do what's right for you but don't let anyone influence your decision, especially passive aggressive co-workers. :)"
"I'm less and less worried about potential judgment for going to Italy having heard the latest here in the US. It sounds like plenty have potentially been exposed due to lack of protective measures, but we're hardly testing anyone. Sounds like Italy has their situation under control. We do not. Maybe before long it will be Italy keeping us out!"
"I am glad to hear that things are 'normal' in Rome. We are scheduled to arrive in Rome on April 7th, and then leave from there on a cruise April 9-19. There are so many uncertainties regarding this trip. Will cruise line cancel? When would they cancel if deemed necessary? All too soon to know. There are a few cruises also leaving Rome in early April, so we are anxious to learn what happens with those."
"It's looking like my employer will ask me to self-quarantine (i.e., work from home) for two weeks following my trip. I have a job where I can work from home, if need be, so it's not a huge inconvenience for me (plus, I can work in my pajamas if I feel like it!), but I can see where it could be for many people. This, despite the fact that the CDC isn't advising against visiting Rome and there are no cases near Rome. The constant media attention and employers' concern about making sure they are taking COVID-19 seriously are a factor here."
"@Greg B - so have you just returned from Rome or are you there now? And is your employer a US company that is asking anyone returning from any Italian trips to self-quarantine for 2 weeks? If so, that's the kind of risk I've been talking about. Like it or not - and whether warranted or not - the extreme caution being exercised by governments and organisations is going to affect many returning tourists. A school near us has closed for the entire week after the return of a ski trip in Italy, even though they didn't visit any areas that have reported cases."
"Aristofane and Giupep71....And to anyone else :) who needs recognition and apprecitation...all the love to you as well! Thank you for your continued efforts, time, and concern. Without all of your updates and comments I would not be able to make an educated decision."
"I leave a week from today. My employer is asking anyone who goes to any country on the CDC's risk list (including Italy, Japan, South Korea) to self-quarantine, regardless of the regions visited."
Yes I know that. I am only informing others in case they used Lufthansa and need to rebook. Goodness..
"Thank you Becky461 and Greg B.Anyway, sorry if I insist, but if the coworkers are the main problem, it is a problem outside Rome (and Italy). And speaking in terms of Italy, when not by travellers but by ordinary people, ignoring difference inside it, seems quite normal.I was attacked when I talked about ignorance and prejudice, let's say maybe ""misinformation"", but anyway something is there, and it's very different from the actual question ""whether Rome is safe""."
Thank you too Nvrdull.
"#156 Thanks Greg, that's interesting. Guessing it won't be long before that CDC list includes many more countries. Italy has been unlucky to be one of the early counties with a spike, but guessing that will soon be forgotten as spikes hit new countries. Fingers crossed we'll ALL get over the worst of this relatively soon. Might be a bumpy ride ahead though... :("
"@Greg B, if my employer asks me to do that I will ask them to either pay me while I'm in self-quarantine and not dock me any time off (I can't work from home) or not go and ask them to pay for all of my cancelled bookings. I'm set to go at the end of April."
Greg B: will your employer (and co-workers) behave similarly if someone in your workplace travels to anywhere in the U.S. that a case(s)? The U.S. now has 60 known cases of it - https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/northe…
"@MomCat - good point, it may well come to that in the US and elsewhere. To be fair, for now Italy has had many more cases (650 positive cases and 17 deaths as of yesterday). Although from what I read yesterday in the NYT and WP from the whistle blower in California, the US may be in for a sudden spike when more testing/reporting gets done. Wall Street's reaction is perhaps a good gauge on that..."

"According to Italian virologist Fabrizio Pregliasco of the University of Milan, whom I have been watching daily on Italian TV news programs, the rate of contagion, WORST CASE, is estimated to be 30-40%.HOWEVER, at least 80% of cases are considered to be no greater than ""mild"" (i.e. requiring only rest at home and self-isolation, as with any kind of flu), and only 5-10% requiring hospitalization/intensive care. It's that last number which has the virologists not sleeping at night, because that translates to between 1.2 and 2.4 MILLION Italian residents (based on a 40% worst-case rate of contagion). The Italian health care system cannot handles these kinds of numbers (no nation on earth can), hence the strong desire to require self-quarantine and to curtail any large gatherings such as sports events, concerts, cinemas, theatres, schools, universities, etc. But this is a world-wide issue, not limited to China, South Korea, Iran and Italy!What is certain is that all of this alarmist media coverage, at all hours of day and night, is killing tourism, air travel, cruise travel, and conventions world-wide. It is also tanking stock markets everywhere. This is probably unavoidable, especially because of the emotional ramifications of this apparent new trend of imposing self-quarantine for travelers returning from ""at risk"" areas.My hope is that the panic will begin to subside in a few weeks, after most countries reach their ""peak"" of virus contagion, and with the approach of warm weather.What I will find interesting is whether this panic will leave permanent trend changes in societies, e.g. more and more universities switching to remote teaching (i.e. via internet connection). Just on this point, this article from LA REPUBBLICA reports that the University of Bologna wants to gradually offer 30-40% of its classes via remote connection rather than in-classroom. Lectures and even oral exams will be offered in this modality. Students will be able to interact and ask questions via the internet. Isn't it interesting that the 30-40% rate just happens to be identical to the worst-case contagion scenario???? Pure coincidence, since any laboratory course does not lend itself to this modality. Online classes will reportedly start on Monday (March 2). The University hopes to fully implement this new initiative within 15 days, and notes that 50% of its 85,000 students reside out-of-region and internationally.https:/…"
"Great post, GAC. Thanks. And btw, yes, I take the point at the end about travel reason.Edited: 1:14 pm, February 28, 2020 "
"@MomCat. take your points, but the ultimate rational behaviour is to act together to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The markets are spooked because they understand that we all have to take an economic hit if that's to happen. Amazon has announced that all employees should defer non-essential travel, including within the US to guard against the spread of the coronavirus among its ranks. I think this is a rational - and the correct - decision. Hopefully others will take their lead."
"I've been thinking about this carefully: If we want to prevent a full pandemic, we need to deliberately weaken our economies by curtailing travel. So yes, I've moved from a suggestion of this being a ethical question to one where I think governments, companies, and other bodies who control our ability to travel probably need to make harsh decisions for the common good."

"This is REALLY BAD, REALLY AWFUL new. Unless the threat level is reduced pretty soon, the tourist season for Italy is finished for much of 2020.

#177 - I hope we can both get to Italy before too long.#178 - I feel for the Italians right now. I was very prepared to spend gobs of money eating my way around Rome and Naples. I promise I will spend my money there as soon as I possibly can!
not sure but with a level 3 do airlines have to allow cancellations with no fees? If you did go there would travel insurance even cover you?
It is still level 2 . Where are you reading different?
#181 - https:/…Italy.html
"This was inevitable before US moved to recommend avoiding travel to Italy. Austria, Croatia, Greece, Switzerland and Algeria in Africa received persons infected in Italy. If the virus can spread from Italy so many countries there is no reason it would not spread to Rome. Many companies have banned official travel to Italy. It will be devastating for Italy from a tourism perspective, but Italy is more than tourism and a G5 economy. So it should bounce back soon."
I’m so hoping we will see a reduction in level in the next week. Still hoping to arrive in Rome 3/15 but doing lots of research on what we can cancel and how. Now trying to decide if travel at all is a good idea this spring break!
I can't image the US airlines phones ringing off the hook right now...Delta has not updated to reflect this news.

"Following this thread. We are flying JFK-LHR on April 3rd, going to London and Paris first week. Then we are flying Paris-Milan on April 11th, going to Milan, Venice, Florence, Pisa and Rome. Flying back to the US from Rome on April 21st. Almost everything is paid now, non-refundable, so hoping no need to cancel. Still 5 weeks away, and following closely."
Very little chance of such an early reduction. More likely that the US authorities will be giving similar advice for internal US travel soon. The second case in California without a clear source doesn't bode well.
"See the decision of the US CDC to lift advice to 'do not travel to Italy.https:/…coronavirus-italyI think the most important line in the CDC statement is this:""There is limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas.""The same statement surely applies to other countries where this gets a grip. Wherever there are medical services strained and possibility of domestic quarantine, the problems of people away from home will increase.But this is terrible news for the Italian economy and Italians in their lives and work.Edited: 7:04 pm, February 28, 2020 "
Boy if 1/2 what the media is reporting this is very scary. If this goes to Pandemic which the experts seem to indicate is likely I can envision borders just shutting down...frankly too many unknowns right now to leave your country of residence wherever that is.
I believe most European countries do not temporarily ban Chinese and South Korean people (the two most infected countries in the world). It'll not be easy to contain the spread.
"Yes I know, a reduction is so doubtful but I’ll hold onto a little hope for a week! I’m curious how experiences are going with those who are cancelling things. Hope everyone has good luck with getting refunds!"
"Thoughts:1: Act with empathy and concern for ordinary people in Italy in all places and all jobs.2: Don't cancel yet if you are not traveling soon.3: Especially if you are booked with ordinary airbnb or such hosts, consider sharing the burden, not whole refund."
From what I have heard Air BNB hosts have cancel policies and are enforcing them...at least in Rome etc. I am sure some will work with people to try transfer deposit to future booking at a time when guests can enjoy the city without worries. This will be temporary and things will turn around...hopefully by summer season when things are really busy.
"#195 gene. ....Some details so clear about my thought of sharing burden with hosts.AirBnB listings have strict/moderate/flexible cancellation policies visible and detailed. At this listing in Trastevere, for example, go way down past the reviews and map and find Cancellation policy and click to read more.https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/24387527Our booking at that property there is from 6 to 18 November.

The basis of my point at #194 is that it's easy to communicate with hosts and it would be easy to come to some arrangement. We have corresponded with hosts on a very friendly basis, as airbnb system makes possible, wonderful way to see the world. Messages of warm welcome. We have bookings for September to November. We booked here for early 2017 but they were wiped out by earthquake and storms then.https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6341791…blogspot.com/2017/01/terrible-conditions-in…We seem to be vectors of misery...I shrink from imagining what situations here or there may be if things are not settled by September-November.

"I too will be there, March 11th. Unless the airlines cancel the flights or the airports close, I am not letting this stop me from taking a dream vacation I have been planning for a year.It is horrible for those who have passed and their loved ones, but I have not seen any evidence that would make me even a bit concerned for my health."
"Feeling for those whose livelihoods will be affected by this, especially the less wealthy with incomes directly tied to the travel industry (wait staff, cleaners, etc). I also sympathise with those being forced to postpone long-planned holidays. Not easy.But the bottom line is that it's inevitable that most of need to take a hit to contain this. These sensible precautions are being put in place to limit damage, and we should all be thinking of the risk to OTHERS if we continue with unnecessary travel. One way of easing the pain might even to think that you are doing your bit for the common good, rather than focus on what you are losing. I'm tempted to regret not tossing a coin over my shoulder into the Trevi Fountain last month, but the fact of the matter is I'm not superstitious and remain hopeful about returning to beautiful Rome in the Autumn.p.s. and my sympathy for Romans is elevated after our recent trip. For such a mass tourist destination, we were surprised at how polite and welcoming people were. The people really are as lovely as the city they call home."
"Sorry but most of latest posts would be more suitable for the topics called ""Coronavirus situation"" or ""Coronavirus: official information"" that TripAdvisor has already opened since some days.If the question is the situation in Rome, for what this topic was opened, and if anyone could be interested, it goes on as usual. I understand some fears, but if each person goes on talking about fears, fears will spread not unlike medical viruses and will paralize every human activity. ""Don't travel because something MIGHT happen"". ""I was smart to cancel, otherwise something MIGHT have happened"". And so away."
"Is Rome safe? The question is slightly bigger than a very narrowly defined answer, so probably best not to try and dictate what people can and cannot say.For example, earlier in the thread, the argument about distance from cases in Northern Italy was being used. Well, that distance just dramatically shortened to Siena (see below). Surely it's just a matter of time (days?) before Rome has more cases?(Source: Guardian, 29/02): An entire Italian Serie-C football team is in quarantine after three players and an official tested positive for coronavirus.Players from Pianese, a side based in Tuscany, began to exhibit symptoms last Saturday, while the team played away against Allesandria."
"Thank you for such a beautiful and thoughtful post, NorthWestUK1.(referencing post #200).Edited: 5:34 am, February 29, 2020 "
"In each case the staying in topic is a basic rule of forums. This one is about Rome, and TA has already provided specific forums about virus in Italy.Following your arguments, one should also stop talking about ""Italy"" because distances are the same inside and beyond borders, maybe about ""Europe"" or ""world"". Some countries are closer to the focuses in Italy than other regions of Italy. But seemingly the US coworkers who may reject return travellers would just stick to the demonized word ""Italy"". I wonder if a person who wondered if cancelling his trip to Sardinia would have been concerned for a trip to Corsica, although Corsica is closer to the focuses than Sardinia. The problem is accepting that not only Italy is large and rich on difference inside it, but also that the world is more complex and can't be described in terms of ""Italy"" versus ""not Italy"". It's the same problem for what some people travelling to Rome assume that doing a day trip to Cinque Terre is doable: ""it's Italy"" and it's all folks."

Thank you NorthWest for talking about the whole pie versus a slice ...
"I'm afraid there will be a short-term hit to tourism, and of course we feel sorry for the effect on locals - but I'm afraid that many tourists just cannot afford the risk.We are booked to go to Rome (which we loved last time) in 15 days time, but are going to move the trip to the autumn, or if we can't then we will just cancel and not go. Risks to my (poor) health + serious effect on our business if we were quarantined/flights cancelled etc make this a no-brainer.We also think that even if infections are low/zero in Rome, the atmosphere would not be the same.I'm well aware that I was probably more at risk last week when in Zermatt than I would be in Rome - but cases are rising rapidly, and for people who need to plan/reschedule weeks in advance we have little choice but to not go, especially given the fast-rising number of cases.Edited: 1:54 pm, February 29, 2020 "
FYI: cdc raises travel advisory for Italy to level 3 Avoid Nonessential Travel:https:/…coronavirus-italy
"Can rebook without penalties BUT will the fare be the same, lower or higher?"
"CNN and NYT reported that VP Pence announced even stronger travel restrictions for those traveling from Iran, South Korea and Italy. Department of state is yet to update their website, but it seems more like a Level 4 (do not travel). Here is the actual quote from CNN: ""Pence said the administration, through the US State Department, would increase the travel advisory for Italy and South Korea to Level 4 -- the highest level, advising American not to travel to specific regions in those countries."""
When i watched it i understood Pence to say “level 4 to the “affected” areas of Italy
"As of now, CDC website is still at level 3-""CDC recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to Italy.""there is no mention of specific areas at level 4.The state dept website-state.gov-is different; level 3 for the country, level 4 for Lombardy and Veneto.https:/…italy-travel-advisory.html"

They are pinned at the top of the Italy forumhttps:/…ShowForum-g187768-i20-Italy.htmlThe structure of TripAdvisor forums and information is hierarchical. At the Italy forum you can see all the Italy forums, including clouds of COVID-19 discussion in many local forums. In the Rome (or Florence, or Venice) forum you can't see that.There is sensible concern in various discussion threads about whether travellers to Italy or parts of Italy will face problems getting home, being allowed entry. Perhaps open a completely new thread in the Italy forum and allow this forum to focus on Rome questions. Getting home to country x is not a Rome question."
"These were Pence's words: “We are going to increase, to the highest level advisory — which is Level 4 — advising Americans: Do not travel to specific regions in Italy and South Korea,” he added. “We are urging Americans to not travel to the areas in Italy and the areas in South Korea that are most affected by the coronavirus.”It's always best to use primary sources with actual quotes, not those summarized by ""news"" outlets such as NYT and CNN, which are known for spinning and getting things wrong.

"Here's what the state department says:Level 4: This is the most severe travel advisory. Travelers are advised not to go to countries that fall under this advisory. This is due to the greater chance of life-threatening risks, the State Department said. The U.S. government also warns that during an emergency, its capacity to help citizens abroad could be severely limited. According to the State Department, these are the countries with Level 4 status, in addition to the restrictions announced for parts of Italy and South Korea on Saturday: Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, China (coronavirus concerns), Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.https:/…about-our-new-products.html"
@Orbops - it should be noted that only the Lombardy and Veneto areas in Northern Italy are Level 4.
Nearmsp: Keep in mind that in 3 days there could also be 150 cases in the US. I doubt if going to Rome is much more dangerous than going to New York City.

"Bowling Dubs...why would you “ignore Level 4 warning” to Venice ....why would you not only put yourself at risk for contracting the coronavirus but put everyone you come in contact in Italy at risk as you travel down to Rome, let alone your friends and family when you get back home.

I’m not looking now I looked at 10am and also 2pm... I’m not that stupid but thanks for the assumption
"Yes.. I am still heading to Rome.. Milan and Venice — not heading that way..plan on leaving next week .. travel level 4 is just for the areas near Milan and Venice ..I imagine that it will spread but stay healthy, stay smart, and I am not worried.. I will enjoy Rome and maybe less crowds :-)"
Or anywhere else nowadays..

You may well be asked to be in isolation for two weeks and ask with whom you have been at all close in your time in Italy. Or the system at home may be lax and you might be let loose. You may have symptoms in Rome an be asked to be isolated at home. You don't have a home in Rome, who will open their doors.

Step 8: Stop suggesting to others you might ignore a Level 4. It just *might* appear selfish in the extreme.
Step 9. Keep an eye out for any decisions by the US government of charges for services it might levy from people who knowingly do this sort of thing. Or did you expect a free ride?Step 10. As to whether United States citizens are inclined to litigation I could not possibly say. Do you have insurance cover against charges for reckless endangerment.

I'm 76, my next great hope is to see new granddaughter in New Zealand (also daughter and son in law) in May. I am quite edgy about even going just that far by then. This is a time for carefulness. A virologist speaking to our national broadcaster a few days ago said it was wise to prepare for a pandemic, not by stripping shelves but buying a little more and stocking up on foods that keep. He didn't mention the matter of having a will. We always forget about the will... It was a great impetus to sort out our wills (in 24 hours) two decades ago when my then wife was diagnosed with the worst kind of brain tumour. This situation is not so certain for anyone, it may be a dodgeable bullet, but it's a good impetus.One of the odd things is that people seem not to take into account that they will spend much more if they go.

"Italian Media is reporting that the CHURCH OF SAN LUIGI DEI FRANCESI in Rome is the first church in the city to CLOSE because a priest has been diagnosed with Coronavirus.

@247...first thing that came to my mind as I read your post is wonder if he was with/near the Pope this week? Not sure why the Pope was out shaking hands...rubbing babies etc. and now out of commision for three straight days?
This thread has once again taken more twists and turns than I can follow and more political comments...sad for sure. But I do think the question asked about ignoring the Level 4 is valid. Having a country with TWO levels seems very hard to monitor for returning passengers to US. I mean it would be 100% self reporting they they flew for example round trip FCO. They could well have spent some time in the level 4 area and not once person would know. Self reporting and quarantining is a real leap of faith...not sure it will work.

"#259 I think so too. Felt like an uphill battle on here sometimes trying to point out the direction of travel on this. If anything, the authorities have been too slow."
@260 it is uphill...people do not want to believe it...so they question your sources. This week will be interesting.
"So, you believe if an American is in dire straits and needs assistance, they will be denied? This is a unique situation - and travel insurance is usually the thing that will not cover some losses if someone ignores certain travel alerts from their government.But to think the government will just let some American(s) twist in the wind is - well, never mind....Sigh"
"Italy death toll hits 34 (Guardian).The number of confirmed cases in Italy has risen to almost 1,700, and the death toll has increased by five to 34, Reuters reports.There were 1,128 cases and 29 death as of last night.This is the largest jump the spread of the virus in one day, Sky News says."
"#262-what's your point? People have been warned-repeatedly!-by the US govt about the virus. The government has issued an explicit warning to not travel.So you travel anyway; who is responsible for that behavior-you or the government?So ""Sigh"" all you'd like; why is it the responsibility of others when a person acts irresponsibly?And I'll be clear-I have no idea what the government will do. But please, don't pretend that you didn't know you weren't taking a risk."

Same here..It's really unfortunate
"Do be careful about rumour and excited statistics. This is a very new situation. When you had a second child you could issue a notice that “our infant production increased by 100% overnight”. Not only are there new cases but if you think cases of anything there will always be a lag in recovery information because, um, it takes time to recover."
"I do not see where MomCat recommended to ignore official warnings coming from the US Government. Who would possibly think of ignoring potentially deadly health threats?I believe her point is this:“But to think the government will just let some American(s) twist in the wind is - well, never mind....”And I totally agree with her point. And all personal attacks on this threat are so petty; especially, at the time when we have a global problem to deal with."
"""Do be careful about rumour and excited statistics.""Rumours yes, but I don't see any above. Plus statistics don't get excited. People get excited. Accurate statistics are exactly the kind of evidence -based information we SHOULD be looking at, regardless of the emotional responses they might evoke. For example, the 50% increase in Italian cases in a single day, as has happened over the previous 24 hours, is an important statistic to pay attention to, especially given the number was already over 1,000 before that jump. Granted, we need to consider other variable such as the numbers of tests being carried out. (Japan, for example, has been deliberately suppressing tests). But in the bigger scheme of things, Italy's cases, as unfortunate as they are, need to be followed daily given that so many cases being reported elsewhere (inc the UK) are being traced to recent Italian travel."
"@264 The problem in my case is that I'm not ignoring the travel warnings, is the darn airline don't want to budge, even though the US government has travel advisory to Level-3, and that you are going to get scrutinize, and at work you may required to self-quarantine on a job you cannot work remote. So, again, is difficult to situation. But still interest to hear people talk about Rome more how is it going right now on ground zero?"
My airline (AerLingus) won't refund or waive a change fee on our tickets (we were thinking of going to London instead of Rome if we could?) so I am starting to wonder if it would make sense to wait it out & see if the situation somehow improves. We are supposed to be in Rome Mar 14-21. Maybe I am being stupidly optimistic?
"We were supposed to travel to Rome tomorrow for four days but taking into account the risk of being avoided by everyone back home because I traveled to Italy, and the rainy weather forecast for the days we were supposed to stay, we decided to cancel and go at a better time so that we can enjoy Rome and not be worried about our travel."

"#273 I think you are being optimistic, but I'd wait it out if I were you, especially as the airline may be forced to cancel, in which case you should be refunded. As for London, I wouldn't rebook to go there or anywhere atm, just hold tight. This situation is changing daily, so who's to say that London won't be in a worse situation by the time you are planning to travel. As Dennis mentions in #275, the Italian authorities will be issuing new directives on Monday. This may also lead to airline cancellations, who knows? #271. Ah, I see. I'm multitasking on other things/places, so I think I'll stick to this place only for now. You are doing a good job though, keep up the good work!p.s. Crock or not, thanks you for 'basilisk eye'. This isn't a phrase I've heard before, and I like to collect new ones. :-)"
"Re 273: Honestly, you may be grateful to get out of US, and Rome may look very good in comparison. Many are expecting an explosion of cases soon in this country now that the CDC has loosened restrictions on testing and is letting states make own arrangements with private testing labs since CDC cannot provide enough reliable test kits.Just look at what happened in WA state last night after they engaged private researchers. They now think the virus may have been circulating in WA for 6 weeks and there could be 150 to 1500 more cases related to just that one teenage boy who tested positive last week.(Those could be people who were sick, are currently sick or are still just incubating).Edited: 3:52 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"I never said to ignore such warnings - Please, post where I said that. I know I did not.My point was (and I think it is obvious) that the U.S. government is not going to leave an American citizen in a dangerous situation if that person did happen to ignore the warning level. That would be an unacceptable punitive action and I, personally, don't believe the U.S. will do that. This situation is confusing and fluid enough without people needing to twist the words here of other posters. Travel insurance? That is another matter -- I know every thing mine does and does not cover and I assume most others do as well given how important it is to know. Hotels, tours and other on the ground booked events, etc will likely need to be addressed individually as to refunds, rescheduling or just simply being out of luck."
"I was sendinding two employees , husband and wife, to Rome for a vacation. I planned trip last year, Turkish air. Friday flight change, not unusual except impossible to make connecting flight. I called thinking some kind of mistake. I was told that yes impossible to make connection from Rome back to Houston. I was told any return trip couldn't be guaranteed. We had to cancel"
My trip is May 27th for 10 days and I’m scared too .... was so excited before this...... no matter what the cost of the loss is though it’s not worth putting my kids lives in danger if this isn’t resolved by then. Please keep me posted on your decision.
Did you go ?
"Just for info. In Rome the situation is the same as yesterday: only 3 cases, same family from a little town near Rome. The good news, 51 of their contacts have been tested and found all negative.Zero new cases today. Today's news is that a priest who lived in Rome was found positive to virus in Paris, so they closed his church here. Trying to understand where he catch the virus, if he made stops in Lombardy."
"Actually, I personally would not rely on State Dept employees. They have suffered cutbacks and in the best if times can't do all they used to.Further, State has made it very clear, in a couple of different ways, that people cannot rely in them to continue to charter planes to get people out of danger zones.Finally, with our own likely upcoming epidemic and a claimed shortage of equipment and supplies (like ventilators), and a possibity some lives may have to be sacrificed for others, why would the government want to risk further straining resources by repatriating more possibly sick people?"
What was your original travel dates?
My employees were to leave tomorrow return in about 10 days
"Will want to start sighing very soon; the government warnings couldn't be any clearer: don't travel to Lombardy and Veneto for any reason, and no nonessential travel to Italy(i.e. no tourist travel).So if a person decides to travel in the face of these warnings, why is the government responsible for their behavior?"
"#283""Further, State has made it very clear, in a couple of different ways, that people cannot rely in them to continue to charter planes to get people out of danger zones.""There is a big difference between helping the repatriation of people caught at the outset of this, in difficult circumstances, when no such crisis had been expected....and helping people who now, risks advised, travel discourage, decide to travel nonetheless.And governments just don't have the resources to do this kind of thing.Edited: 5:09 pm, March 01, 2020 "

Thank you...
#273 - we are going same time on same airline.. we are going to try and go.. hand sanitizer and clorox wipes.. Seems to be as long as your smart about it and not be complacent .. you will enjoy yourselves..We are trying to stay positive
"Is it spreading throughout Italy yet or staying confined to the northern regions? I only keep seeing talk about the northern region. Has Rome been taking a hit yet? Florence? Amalfi Coast?

"Unfortunately things will change in Rome. Imagine how many people attended mass.""People walk past the St. Louis of the French church in Rome, Sunday, March 1, 2020. The French community church in Rome, St. Louis of the French, closed its doors to the public on Sunday, reportedly after a priest was infected with a new virus. The church in the historic center of Rome is famous for three paintings by the Baroque master Caravaggio, and is a tourist draw. A sign on the door Sunday noted in French that the church had been closed as a precaution by the French Embassy for both Masses and touristic visits until further notice.""(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)Credit: The Associated Presshttps://www.wbal.com/article/438773/130/viru…"
"I suppose that San Luigi Dei Francesi will reopen once disinfected (which needs to be done very carefully, so as not to damage the precious works of art). The three Caravaggio paintings in the Contarelli Chapel are universally-recognized masterpieces of Mannerist Art.As one would expect, Priests have been instructed to stop giving Communion on the tongue (only in the hand), stop the practice of shaking hands during Mass (the ""Sign of Peace""), and removing Holy Water from fonts."
"# lohsefamily6The situation in Rome as of 1 March it's in my previous post.PSThe figures per region: site corriere.it and see the panel ""i dati regione per regione"". They are updated at our 6pm.(Lazio is Rome region- has 6 cases but 3 were healed)."
new facts here... the government decreehttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g18…
"Roman authorities should take note of the US case in Washington State after a second death and a sudden spike in confirmed cases.The important bit here is that US authorities downplayed risks and didn't do proper testing after that first case was reported more than a month ago. As the NYT reports, ""The state went weeks without any more positive tests; only a few dozen potential cases were tested in that period.""In Rome after last month's confirmed cases, does anyone know the testing situation? I do know that politicians and others were vocally trying to downplay the risks there too in efforts to protect the tourist industry."
"#299, please provide source and clarity to your last assertion.Please see the translation of national decree herehttps:/…105819253check for nuances at regional government web site. See my description of procedures herehttps:/…105819458And other things in that thread.The facts are out there. This is an intelligent country. Much depends on civil behaviour and sensibility and capacity to cope with the burdens of the situation."
"https:/…US situation described above.The Roman politicians' assertions I was reading a few days ago. I'll track down source - give me a bit.Edited: 2:48 am, March 02, 2020 "
"#299: Please note that your asssertion can be true, but it can apply about every situation in civilized world at now. As the number of cases is starting to spikw in U.S. West Coast and in France, it could spike tomorrow in Rome, it is true, but it could spike in England or in other parts of the U.S., or about everywhere as well"
"There are possibly politicians who make assertions in the UK. A few days ago is a thousand years in this. Assertions that there will not be testing, are you making such? Be conscious of Italian political situation, that in the north La Lega of Matteo Salvini governs regions except Emilia Romagna, the Cinque Stelle, formerly aligned with La Lega governs Rome, the national government is a centre left alliance of recent times following failure of the Cinque Stelle-Lega coalition. Note that La Lega is working with the Berlusconi party and Fratteli d'Italia, heirs to fascism, to shift everything to the right and bring down the government. And so it goes. The presidents of the northern regions happy to criticise the central government, assert inadequacies. No such naughtiness in your country or mine, eh!! :-)"
"#302. Absolutely agree. I've been careful throughout this thread to say the same thing. This is a problem that will hit many countries hard as we go on. Italy has been unlucky to be one of the first to get such a big hit. Indeed, I'd also like to add that I applaud the rapid response of the authorities in Northern Italy, especially given the pressures they were under to downplay (and limit testing) from some quarters. (google for sources on this, it's common knowledge now). Re potential to spike elsewhere, again 100% agree. We had a case here in the UK just 20 miles from where we live, and I think it's just a matter of time (days?) before testing will show cases even closer to home. It's a shared problem, and I've also been arguing here and elsewhere for people to limit unnecessary international AND domestic travel."
"#303. Indeed. Populist politicians more skilled at stirring up divisions than bringing people together are exactly the type of leaders we DON'T need right now. The USA and the UK have notable examples. Re testing assertion, I was asking the question about Rome vis a vis the US given what we now know about testing there. The suggestion is that if testing *has* been limited (I don't know, has it?), it's probably increased the risk of a sudden spike. Same goes for everywhere, but we are talking about Rome here - and even if we look at earlier contributors to this thread, we can see that when there are serious economic consequences at stake, some will deliberately want to downplay risks and blame others. (Elsewhere, look at Trump's response: the news conference called to discuss coronavirus became a politically motivated show that discussed the stock markets above public health. But I digress...).Edited: 3:34 am, March 02, 2020 "
"It is very frustrating when we all have to deal with such an unknown. It affects everyone but human nature makes us worry and consider ourselves more than others. I admit I am concerned about loss of money spent. Travel from Australia is long and costs a lot of money. We have been waiting for this trip for years. Twelve months of organising, thousands and thousands of dollars spent . Doctor's advice of care and concern taken on board, but we waited to cancel until we couldn't wait any longer. Offers of postponement not met with positive emails from accommodation. Offers from them to postpone for three months to postpone is not enough. This virus may turn out to be the norm in years to come, but it's not now. I empathise with the companies but its the smaller places refunding not the large conglomerate, which I find telling."

"+1 to post 306 above.Yesterday we managed to move our flights/hotel British Airways package to Rome from two weeks time to September - but we cannot stay in the original hotel we booked because it has raised its price by £450 for a 3 night stay in September!

If they tell me its going to get worse before it gets better, I'll listen. I won't panic, but I'll heed. I am not so young anymore and while relatively healthy, I know my limits.

CDC has moved Italy to a Level 3: avoid nonessential travel. That should be all you need to get complete refunds from hotels and airlines. Try again and let the venues know you are aware of that. I was due to be in Rome: March 15-20. I cancelled last week (before the upgrade in advisory); so I definitely would advise you to do the same. Be safe!
"#313. Yes, that CDC move to Level 3 a few days ago was a game changer for many on here. I'm sorry to hear you didn't wait it out. :-( Maybe worth following up though?#312. Trying to blame 'the media abroad' for not understanding distance isn't useful. The EU has today raised the coronavirus risk level to ‘moderate to high’ across the entire EU. The US government is not 'the media' and they are advising against any non-essential travel to the whole of Italy."
"The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has published an up to date list of cases of infection and fatality within the European economic area, the UK, San Marino, Monaco and Switzerland.There have been 2,199 cases and 38 deaths reported: Italy (1,689), France (130), Germany (129), Spain (83), United Kingdom (36), Switzerland (24), Norway (19), Sweden (14), Austria (14), Netherlands (13), San Marino (8), Greece (7), Croatia (7), Finland (6), Denmark (4), the Czech Republic (3), Iceland (3), Romania (3), Belgium (2), Estonia (1), Ireland (1), Lithuania (1), Luxembourg (1) and Monaco (1).35 deaths were in Italy; two deaths have been reported in France, and one death has been reported from San Marino.(Source: Guardian.)"
There are plenty of other governments who didnt't give such advice. I wouldn't degrade their behaviour like that.

"Nice article, the one by Severgnini :)Political parenthesis: interestingly to this date the problem is focalized in Lombardy mostly. For reasons unknown the regional governor blames it all on the Prime Minister, and it's quite interesting if we consider that when it comes to positive results obtained by Lombardy region the local government uses those as excuses to cry for financial autonomy.Edited: 9:50 am, March 02, 2020 "
"Ad far as I can read, the originary post asked people who live in Rome to give updates, and all I can read is people from everywhere commenting whatever u.s. newspapers or authorities say. Anyway,As of today, official statement, we have 8 cases. A family of 4, a family of 3, plus one coming to Rome from veneto. The origin of contagion for the families was lombardy as usual. None of this cases is actually from Rome. They are from two little nearby towns (fiumicino and pomezia) but are hospitalized in Rome. Cheers"
"#319. Thanks for the update pieri d. You've been a fair local reporter here. I know the thread has expanded, but I think it's acting as a good single resource for people planning Rome travel, and I hope most people agree that pooling resources is a good thing. To be very honest, based on what I've seen so far it might be unwise to leave the reporting of information to only locals or 'destination experts'. Not everyone reports information fairly like yourself. So thanks again for your updates. Maybe you could make sure to update at least once daily? I think people would appreciate it."
"Thank you Pierl d. That is so helpful.I also agree that maybe you could update daily? We are due to come into Rome at the end of March. Our trip is through Expedia and is non-refundable. We would like to hear the latest updates in Rome, since that is where we would be traveling."
"Lohsefamily6: daily updating is not easy, especially if, as Pieri has well said, so many people from everywhere intervene to say everything they want. Anyway, is such updating so useful for you? You still have almost one month to decide. Focusing day by day the attention on ""updating"" as if it were a war front risks to make you more anxious than necessary. In this moment, keep calm, live your life and set your mind elsewhere."
"Think that report of 8 should actually be 12 now.13:38 - Twelve (12) cases in Rome There are currently 12 positive cases of Coronavirus ascertained between Rome and the Province. From Spallanzani's latest data there are 7 hospitalized: the Chinese couple by now negative, a policeman hospitalized yesterday, the Fiumicino family (mother, father and a daughter) and a last case with a Venetian epidemiological link. To this must be added the family unit of the hospitalized policeman (wife, two children and sister-in-law), all positive and in health surveillance at home, and a positive fireman at the test and surveillance in the Capannelle barracks.https://www.corriere.it/cronache/20_marzo_02…"
"Bizarre - now NWUK1 seems to have appointed himself arbiter of who IN Italy is the one and only one here being ""fair"" in posting their personal observations - Most adult humans know that every single person has a different perspective about - well, everything - based on who they are, their own personal experiences (daily and otherwise) - Hence, while it is great and I do very much appreciate every actual Italian who lives in Italy here posting what they are experiencing, resources based on facts (not fear and hyperbole) will likely be the most useful information about what is or is not occurring somewhere.I would never, as a New Yorker, presume to explain what is going on in all corners of NYC - just as no one anywhere can do such a thing. Let alone rely on someone who is not even in Italy but has taken it upon themselves (for whatever reasons) to be the one(s) to attempt to direct how information flows on these threads/forums, which is just silly given it is a worldwide anonymous travel forum with participants with all sorts of perspectives, agendas, fears, concerns - i.e., human nature....Good luck trying to control it NWUK1 - that's quite a task you have given yourself."

"“”Hence, while it is great and I do very much appreciate every actual Italian who lives in Italy here posting what they are experiencing, resources based on facts (not fear and hyperbole) will likely be the most useful information about what is or is not occurring somewhere.””I cannot agree more with you, MomCat. I just do not understand why any keenly interested tourist cannot do his own research and make his own judgement based on the facts available online and, what is the most important, official government websites. All it means is analyze the news he/she trusts and ignore all the sensationalism. Of course, the concerns are serious, but I just do not understand how daily updates on TA can help; especially, when the number of posts is growing exponentially. And yes, I am finding the updates from those who are actually in Rome now very useful and greatly appreciate them. Well, I am off to NYC on March 12th and decided not to dwell on a couple of newly discovered cases."
"Thanks no problem for updating, I can suggest the link at the roman daily bulletin but it's in Italian:http://www.inmi.it/bollettino-coronavirus. Yes the cases are now 10: two families from fiumicino and pomezia + fireman + another. 12 includes the 2 chinese but now they are ok.I agree with aristofane that anyway it doesn't change that much. Cases will probably increase day by day, hopefully not like in the north, if northeners help by locking themselves in their goddamn homeland. Because the only big problem we have here is to to find hospital beds and doctors in case of hundreds of cases at the same time. I don't work in tourism so don't care to influence anyone. My humble opinion is I don't know if I would come here now. The problem is not being killed by the virus, but airline cancellations, risk of quarantines etc. But in 3-4 weeks things can definitely go better I hope."
"Trying to manage info on a website like this is an example of the saying ""herding cats"" - it's just impossible and so much utter nonsense is getting posted with a bunch of unneeded editorializing to go with it - Even if people are interested in reading the countless links being posted, they have to wade through so much personal opinion to even get to themI would like to think people are not making decisions based on all this stuff here on the forum but, unfortunately, some likely are Have a good trip here Noraatc - Enjoy! Hopefully, we will avoid the hysteria around all this but, who knows...."
"Hi, question regarding your cancellation. Were you able to get a refund from airline? I cancelled our trip March 23-31 to Italy as well, my airline said to call back so they can decide what to do."
Was wondering should we really go to Italy this month so number-crunched some odds and our regular trips to Malaysia (wife is from there) are 100 times more likely to give us dengue fever. So that puts it a little in perspective. P.
"If I have faith in anything happening here in the states about this situation, it is faith that the hysteria and panic will surely increase. Thanks Pierl D and Aristofane (hi again!) for your on the ground observations - I have a trip back to Rome but not yet for a number of months - I have been thinking of sneaking in a mid-Spring trip but still have to sort out my work schedule before committing. My friends in Rome are all saying pretty much similar things, life is going on for them as it normally does with the expectation that it is all very fluid right now and no one knows what will or will not occur next"
Ryanair just announced it is cancelling 25% of its flights to Italy and British Airways just announced cancellation. Of hundreds of flights to Europe including Italy - so anyone with flights should check whether their flight is still operating and whether they need to change arrangements
"We actually booked our trip last week, knowing that the coronavirus could threaten the trip. We are set to arrive first week of April. We made sure to purchase travel insurance (including medical) and full refund if flight is canceled. So far it seems Rome is clear to travel and we will be staying south to Rome. We do NOT plan on canceling. Worse case scenario if it causes concern for Rome and they close off travel, then we will recieve a refund for our flight and stay. I pray it doesnt happen for the sake of the people, country and our much looked forward to dream vacation."
"#332-why the constant attacks claiming ""fear and hysteria"" when people disagree with you? It's clear that you believe that you can travel where you want when you want, and if anything goes wrong, the US govt will bail you out. That's just great.

"Hrt: You have some notion you know anything about me - at all? You don't. You have done nothing but reach incorrect conclusions about me and completely misrepresent what I said about government assistance. I'm not advising anyone here to do one thing or another (except to, hopefully, look instead at reputable sources to help make their decisions), what is there to disagree with me about? Just because I said I doubt that the US will let an American suffer because they ignored the level 4 alert does not mean I think the ""the US govt will bail you out"" as you put it: I just believe that the government would find a way to provide assistance to someone in trouble - IF possible.And, if I do decide to go in Spring, I will not go if the alert is at level 4 in Rome (or did I need to spell that out for some reason for you?) - As of right this second, Rome is not at that level 4 alertAnd, yes, I do think there is hysteria and panic on the loose here, there and pretty much everywhere regarding this and now beginning here - so what? It is my opinion. We have one person out of 8 million plus here in NYC with the virus - look at some of the headlines....if that is rational stuff to you, great. I recognize it for what it is"
"#338 Your posts are pellucid, and reveal quite a bit about you. You clearly believe that no matter what your choices, the government will bail you out. Remember all that sighing?And what, in the world, does the status of COVID19 in NYC have to do with Rome? Answer: nothing, yet you keep repeating it.And again with the ""fear and hysteria"" attacks, with you once again ignoring anything related to science or the facts.Here's a fact: he US CDC has issued a level 3 warning-Avoid all non-essential travel to Italy, which, by the way, is where Rome is located. Tourism, by its very definition, is nonessential travel.So travel if you want-it's your choice. But I'll value Dr Fauci's opinion much more than yours."
"#336. David R, thanks for the link. It struck me reading it (he had visited Lombardy) that Romans should also be worried about the influx of tourists. We have been focussed here on the possibility of getting the virus and bringing it back home and infecting others. Surely another issue, especially now that the virus is spreading elsewhere quite quickly, is that tourists coming in are also presenting a risk of exacerbating the local problem. No matter how I look at this issue, I still can't see anything more sensible (for everyone) than curtailing travel. It's the smart thing to do and it's the right thing to do."
What travel insurance did you get? I could not find a single company that would reimburse your airfare due to a known pandemic.
"@338 It is most certain that while there is one reported case in NYC everyone knows there are more with the virus...testing is just now becoming available and that number will go up...NYC still has flights coming in with people who have been in Iran, Asia and Italy including the North. Any major hub cities in US will have cases...Also with the reported cases now in Rome who knows what will happen there...France is feeling it too...everyone will...just to what extent and for how long is the question. I would not be that concerned about walking around Rome...reports that things are ""normal"" are great...it is the 8 hour+ time in the airplane with people that may well have been to the hot spots and are asymptomatic . Time will tell."
@341 I was wondering that too..although it is an epidemic not pandemic....the cancel for any reason insurance will cover it but not full compensation...only a %....and the insurance is really not needed if airline cancels flight they have to refund. Did not get that post at al.

@Gene - If the airlines cancel flights or the gov't imposes restrictions on travel to and from Italy then people will be able to get their airfare refunded. However CFAR's won't cover it except in the event that the coverage was purchased prior to this outbreak. I contacted about a dozen insurance carriers and none of them will cover someone wanting to cancel at this point.

314. I had trip insurance (luckily) and I got all my monies back. I'm still completely bummed about it however.
"#349. Did you notice I said be wary of throwing around statistics. As before we seem to be in agreement. #347 Gene. Not all readers have been here for long. A request for daily update and the point being made that daily update is not simple. There are lots of anecdotes. The title of the thread is “is Rome safe: coronavirus”. There are advisories from regional and local government. My point was to remind of that. You might wish to do that. Pokémon: the point is metaphor.Edited: 3:15 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"Although the situation is volatile and uncertain, some of the people commenting on here having nothing to do with living in or visiting Rome should at least be banned from the forum if not sued for liability. Some of you guys deal in fearmongering and fake news and it is disgusting."
"#353. Perhaps you could point out the actual instances of ""fearmongering and fake news"" you are referring to. It would be helpful to back up your assertions, especially when you are calling for people to be banned and (incredibly) suggesting people should be sued for liability. Let's keep calm here. :)#349. Not sure how we are in agreement as you seem to be criticising the use of stats. What am I missing - genuinely confused on this? (Btw, I hope we are in agreement of course!)."
"Ok #353-"" Some of you guys deal in fearmongering and fake news and it is disgusting.""What exactly are the ""fearmongering"" and ""fake news""?

Wow! Can I ask what company covered? I'm running into epidemic exclusions even with our cancel for any reason policy.
"I, for one, am very grateful for DennisA’s invaluable contributions and efforts, especially regarding the coronavirus and appropriate official links.

"@341 and 343. I am one of the folks that mentioned travel insurance and cancelling, not sure if your posts are directed at mine, but yes, my travel insurance covered my flight and hotel even though my hotel fought the insurance and said the booking was non-refundable; they ultimately returned my money. (I am so grateful!)FYI: My insurance just said ""trip protection"" and did not say ""cancel for any reason"" specifically. It appears I may have just lucked out.Edited: 3:52 pm, March 02, 2020 "
"#357. I'll second that about Dennis' contributions. We may be occasionally in confused agreement (genuinely not sure which of us is confused though!), but I admire his attitude and tone. And yes, his senior humour - or is it just wisdom? Thanks Dennis. :)Now back to facts and stats!"
"CNN just broadcasted a press conference today at 14:45 pm March 2, 2920 - given by the Vice President Pence and the task force on the Corona virus- they announced there will be screenings for the virus in all airports in Italy and South Korea within 12 hours for all direct flights to the US."

My employer and my husbands employer have both stated we would not be able to return to work for 14 days if we travel to Italy so we decided we should postpone our trip. Our trip was scheduled for 3/20-3/28 . We had booked non refundable connecting flights using Chase points. I called Chase last Friday and was told if we canceled we would lose our points. This morning I received an email from Brussels Airlines stating they changed our outbound flight leaving Rome. The new flight is 4 hours later than what we originally booked and we would miss our connection. I called Chase again and was able to cancel and they refunded all of my points. So happy to at least get the points back even though we are out some money for the apartment rental and tickets for the Coliseum.Most airlines will be reducing their flights so more people will be able to get refunds.Like everyone else who has had to cancel I am very disappointed. I also feel badly for the people who live in Italy and depend on tourism money. This is a no win situation.
https:/…italy-europe-coronavirus-.amp.htmlInteresting reading from the perspective of an Italian.
"We arrived back from Rome to London yesterday. We spent three nights and four days in the city. All the places of interest were open as usual. This is a quieter time of year to go and it was still relatively busy. We encountered lots of people in masks but there didn't appear to be any panic regarding the Coronavirus situation in other parts of Italy. We were not given any information at either airport entering or leaving of how to take precautions against the virus but had obviously read about how to protect ourselves by vigorous hand washing, the use of hand gels etc before we travelled. At no time were we advised not to travel. We had a lovely time and it did not spoil our break. We sat outside as much as possible to eat and drink as the weather was fine and always made sure we had hand gel and tissues. Unless you are advised not to travel have a wonderful time."
"Just to note, removed posts above were from Joanne. She posted #364 six times, so five were removed as duplicates."
"Received this today.Italy is a safe country, it is safe to live in Italy and it is safe to travel to Italy.The Italian National Health System, among the most efficient in the world, immediately implemented procedures directed at safeguarding citizens and tourists. Intense controls made it possible for the Italian Government to monitor and contain the spreading of Covid-19 from the earliest diffusion outside the Chinese borders.The adoption of extraordinary preventive actions, such as the temporary closure of several sites or the suspension of several events, represents cautionary measures which have nothing to do with the spreading of the virus throughout the Italian territory.In accordance with the data provided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to date only 0.05% of Italy is affected by extraordinary measures of temporary isolation of some Italian cities (equal to 0.1% of the total) aimed at avoiding the spread of the virus.Only 11 out of 7904 Italian cities are affected by such measures:Lombardy: Bertonico, Casalpusterlengo, Castelgerundo, Castiglione D'Adda, Codogno, Fombio, Maleo, San Fiorano, Somaglia, Terranova dei Passerini.Veneto: Vo’ EuganeoThe remainder of the country, including the Italian regions where the cities in temporary isolation are located, is safe and accessible. All services and activities for citizens and tourists are normally provided and the quality of life, for which Italy is famous world-wide, remains high.For additional information, please consult the following links:Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International CooperationMinistry of HealthNational Institute of HealthEpiCentro, portal of epidemiology for public healthWorld Health Organization"
"#362, seems some employers are taking those kind of 'blanket' actions. I had a similar email this morning at work. I agree it's a no-win.Understandably people always fear the unknown; trying to contain the spread is good, but on the other hand panic doesn't help."
"I went this weekend too. Flew out of lgw on Friday evening, back in to lgw Monday lunchtime. Flight out was full. Probably every four rows someone was in a mask. Flight home was third full at most.At Rome airport there were some bored looking medics sat down in red uniforms that arrivals had to walk past. Coming home I had the back of my hands swabbed by security at Rome (girlfriend didn't, stupidly I didn't ask why).Busy places were still busy, pantheon and Trevi fountain during the day, Emma on Sunday lunchtime, Ai tre Scalini on a Sunday evening. Maybe the quieter places were more affected, hotel bar at 11pm on a saturday was empty even though it was a pleasant evening with a roof terrace view over the city and Spanish steps early Sunday afternoon seemed quiet. Everyone I spoke to was friendly and accommodating, the odd person with a sniffle or a sneeze which any other year you wouldn't give a second glance to.I had a great time, saw some awesome sights, ate some awesome food, drank some awesome wine and washed and sanitised often.I'm glad I went.Edited: 7:52 am, March 03, 2020 "
"It's still winter and off season so it always quieter this time of year - and now more so due to people deciding not to visit.The hand swabbing may have been the swabbing they sometimes do re: security when looking for chemicals, etc - Or, it may be some other ""test"" for this virus - not read about it yet, so I'm curious but my first guess is the usual swabbing they have been doing for a number of years now - Glad you had a nice time -"

"As kindly requested, a quick update.. :) According to official statement it seems progressing very slow and well under control, until now.As of today 14 cases, plus the chinese couple =16. And above all, as far as I can understand, no case has roman origin and only one of those people is from Rome."
Thank you for the update @Pierl d.
"# 368 and #364, Thank you for the information, and it's wonderful to hear that you had a good time!# 371, thank you for the statistics update. Hopefully it will remain as such, and thus we will be coming to your beautiful, historically rich city next week!"
"pierl, thank you very much for your update! Much more valuable information than posting links, which a google savvy person can easily find himself/herself and then make their own decisions. We are all adults here and, hopefully, the adults, who do not ignore personal hygiene and exercise caution in their travels. Chris, Joanne, so glad you enjoyed Rome! In April, I hope to enjoy London, where I think you live, and have no plans to cancel my trip so far."
Currently in Rome and if we had not seen the news we wouldn't know there was a virus around- certainly no issue here in central Rome.I would add the plane(Jet2) from Birmingham on Monday morning was a third empty. Maybe it was not fully booked or maybe people unnecessarly panicing not sure? But glad we are here.
Thanks for the update Phil! Have a great trip. Keep us updated please.
"Has the Rome-Ostia half marathon on Sunday been cancelled? I'm looking at the 17:47 update here, but not sure if the translation I'm being given is correct.https://www.corriere.it/cronache/20_marzo_03…"
"yes, confirmed elsewhere too.#377: Today, in a meeting in the Prefecture on the coronavirus emergency, convened by the prefect Gerarda Pantalone and attended by the governor of Lazio, Nicola Zingaretti, and the mayor of Rome, Virginia Raggi, was assessed as ""inappropriate for the half marathon to unfold"". The Capitol therefore issued a cancellation."

"Anyone due to travel imminently from the US, keep a close eye on CDC updates. https:/…coronavirus-italy With 9 deaths in US now, Trump has announced he may further tighten limits on international travel in hopes of blocking the arrival of more visitors infected by coronavirus. (NYT)"
Not wishing to argue but pleas remember 300000 people past away in america from the the flue this year
"Hi trap1, #382. Think you better look at your numbers. The most ever was circa 61,000 in the 2017-2018 flu season. And it's way lower than that this season. But also, please note that 45 million were infected in 2017-2018. And coronavirus has a much higher death rate in percentages (so far). In other words, you should probably hope it doesn't keep spreading..."
@381 correct....with the numbers going up steadily in Italy including other parts (not just North) and Trump now saying tomorrow 3/4 they will expand the countries and warnings...I think it is reasonable to expect all of Italy will be including in the level 4...just a heads up to those with Rome based trips to consider this possibility. Could be wrong but it seems logical.
"""voices of reason"" must be a flexible term; for the 2018-2019 flu season-most recent complete figures available, there were 61, 200 flu deaths in the USA. That's far too many, but multiples less than the number claimed in #382.https:/…"
At this point I prefer to use this “flexible term” and avoid guessing games. I do not see any proof for the numbers provided in post 382. You prefer to live in fear? Do so. To each his own.
Live in fear? My post simply states the facts.So are you afraid of facts?
"I see only assumptions and no facts. If you know at what rate coronavirus will spread, you clearly have a crystal ball... because medical community does not know yet. I prefer to wait and base my conclusions on facts, you can do what you want - free country."
Pardon if I provide links to factsUShttps:/…flu-season-2020-what-to-knowhttps://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htmWorld [WHO]https:/…Europehttps:/…seasonal-influenzaItalyhttps:/…stagione-in-corso
"#390. In that deleted posting I provided links to WHO, US, EU and Italian official flu statistics."
"Nora is right. There is not yet enough data on COVID -19 to make any inferences about rates, percentages, comparisons, etc. People here are comparing long term flu data with that of a novel virus, mixing US samples with worldwide samples with very different levels of medical care quality, and even using different bases for denominators in the rate calculations. This leaves any conclusions flawed."
"You know, I am reading some of these comments and wondering why people are so upset if someone disagrees with someone's decision to go..or not to go. Surely we all realize that everyone wants to continue with their trip, but everyone's circumstances and knowledge and level of fear, possible due to illness or age or just not wanting to risk it, are different. Don't let this become Facebook."
"#391. Yes, I also agree that flu comparisons aren't useful (even less so when they are exaggerated). And mortality rates from COVID-19 in percentage terms aren't much of an indicator until testing becomes widespread . Even scientific advisers (to leaders) and medical experts that I've been listening to have been keen to stress we shouldn't assume COVID-19 will be mitigated in warm weather like the flu. So yes, conclusions drawn at this point will inevitably be flawed."
Sorry I got numbers wrong for USA .I cant find the article I read It might have been world .Again Sorry

As I listen to the spread of cases worldwide the link to Italy is a common theme...those were people that went before this was known....I hope that somehow people can see the wisdom of postponing or canceling their trips. @396 I agree that more travel announcements will follow...have not seen today's numbers but yesterday they really jumped and not only in north.
"Update on #396. Italian Education Minister, Lucia Azzolina, said the decision to close schools and universities across the country until mid-March - reported by the Italian news agency Ansa and several local outlets has not yet been taken but will be decided “in the next few hours”."
"#389-in my post at 386, I correct a grossly factually incorrect post which you had deemed to be ""reasonable"". No crystal ball was involved, no predictions-so what's the ""assumption""? It's a fact poster was way off in his figures, almost 5x-that's a fact.And #382 has returned, claiming he can't find the source-well, he can't find the source of his figures because it doesn't exist.So are you afraid of the facts?"
"As to this query in post 393 - ""You know, I am reading some of these comments and wondering why people are so upset if someone disagrees with someone's decision to go..or not to go."" My personal take is that some people get are not comfortable when others make a different choice than they have made or that they believe all these strangers should make. It is the nature of the beast - the internet.As we are seeing from some posters, decisions about their own travel are being made - not surprisingly. How they reach those decisions is no one's business but some are inclined to explain their choices - which may help some others to decide one way or the other.It is so tragic that people are becoming ill and worse, and others have been exposed - and, such a shame that so many people are having to struggle with this issue (on both sides of the financial transactions) For all those deciding to cancel, I hope you will get to Rome in the future as - I'm pretty sure - it will still be there.....to explore and enjoy."
"@399.I was referring to trap1’s post #366, not #382, which he acknowledged to be incorrect. And if you read my post, I clearly mentioned that I do not see any proof for the numbers provided in post #382, didn’t I?To explain what I meant again: there is absolutely no proof at this point coming from the medical community on how contagious the coronavirus is.. same as flu... less than flu... more than flu? And I am waiting to see more facts from the professionals. If you are a doctor, I will be more than willing to accept your facts. MCat, nutsabouttravel, I will repeat again: thank you to be the voice of reason. It is up to all travelers to Rome to decide at this point. All I know that fear is the worst companion on a trip and those who are not comfortable going to Rome now did the right thing canceling."
"This thread is supposed to be about Rome.To return to the questions asked by the original poster, there are currently 14 known coronavirus infections (none currently fatal) in Lazio, the region with a population of nearly six million people of which Rome is the capital.On the general question 'Is Rome safe?' people might like to know that in 2018 there were nearly 12,000 road traffic accidents in the city resulting in injury, with 143 fatalities. But it's probably not safer to cower at home, as around three times as many fatal accidents probably happen inside the home than on the roads."

"It's not ""fake"" news -"
"#403...if you are flying to Rome on Sunday (5 days from now U.S. time), why are you questioning if something is “fake news”... unless you’re pulling out last minute, I assume you’re visiting Italy. Read up on what there is to see and do, expect some things to be closed but most probably open (look up on websites), have nice self-guided walks in neighborhoods of interest and enjoy the city. Italy is taking precautionary measures because it takes this situation seriously. As a tourist, you should too.Edited: 11:15 am, March 04, 2020 "

Our tour company has now cancelled Italy trips through April20. And yes that included 3 days in Rome.
I wish the same. I work in a hospital. I cannot go there with a level 3 warning and Alitalia is not helping at all at the moment
"#410 #412: Hope you haven't voluntarily cancelled flights even if you definitely won't travel. There is still a chance airlines will cancel flights or be forced to cancel by new government regulations. In which case non-refundable expenses like this might be automatically refunded down the line. Hope your future trips to Rome will be even better than this one would have been.Edited: 2:59 pm, March 04, 2020 "
I have not voluntarily canceled my flight just for that reason. Things are either going to get better or much worse in 3 weeks so I’m holding out hope for a cancellation. Some airlines are offering changes for free but you must travel by June which is ridiculous to think that people can arrange a trip like that again so quickly
"Some people here were saying they are attending the Italy V England rugby game. Latest suggestion is that it will be played behind closed doors. Here's the latest:It appears all sporting events in Italy will become behind-closed-doors fixtures for 30 days from 3 April. Besides numerous rounds of domestic professional football fixtures, that would also cover the Italy v England Six Nations match a week on Saturday 14 March; though this has not yet been confirmed.This is now backed up by a report in the Gazzetta di Parma newspaper. It says a draft order will go even further and decree that all sporting events in the “red zone” will be cancelled altogether, while those outside it will be played behind closed doors.

"For those flying back to the US, I just received an email from the US Embassy with the following excerpt:""The Government of Italy has implemented enhanced screening and quarantine measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. As of 12:00 AM March 3, all passengers on U.S.-bound flights whose temperature is higher than 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit are not being permitted to board. Travelers should be prepared for additional travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice. Visit the website of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for additional information on these new measures. Travelers who are not permitted to board should follow the instructions of the Italian authorities.""I received this because I always register my international trips with the US State Dept. Step Program. This way I am notified if there is an alert of some sort. If you're interested, here is the webpage:https:/…international-travel.htmlLook to the right where it says ""Enroll in STEP."""
"Thank you so much, nutsabouttravel! I just signed up for the alerts. This exactly the information travelers need."
American travelers in Italy who have a fever will be really screwed up regardless of the cause of the fever.
Just saw a video of a couple of the Rome tourist attractions. Dead. We are waiting to cancel. Not worth the risk of being quarantined.
"In other news, yesterday I received not one but two cheery and glossy emails from Alitalia's ""Mille Miglia"" club suggesting that since they keep flying maybe I should keep traveling. Have no immediate plans to go to Italy, but is nice to know someone is still flying there in case I get the urge. May also be useful to anyone who finds their US carrier's flight canceled. Note that Alitalia partners with Delta and Air France."
"#427I very strongly suspect that the Coronavirus crisis will provide the justification for the Italian Government to AGAIN renew the huge ""bridge loan"" which is keeping bankrupt Alitalia flying beyond May 31, when the most current extension lapses. This is supposed to be the ""last"" extension. Otherwise, Alitalia will need to close shop. There are no buyers. It has already furloughed one third of its workers due to the loss of revenue and passengers.United is still flying between JFK and MXP, although with very few travelers. Their seat map for March 5 on this route shows 3 passengers in business (8% occupancy) and 20% occupancy in coach. They won't keep this up much longer."
Unlucky for me being booked on the airline that keeps on flying! Praying Alitalia starts cancelling soon
Info from US Embassy in Rome: https:/…
"United announced today they are cutting both domestic and international flights effective April due to severe drop in bookings. They said cuts will be 10% on domestic and 20% on international (except for Asia, where cuts are much higher). They said further cuts are possible in May, announced a hiring freeze, and offered employees unpaid leaves of absence. I think they are now the only US carrier still flying to Milan, but wouldn't be surprised if that is one of the cut flights."
"Nutsabouttravel, thank you, very helpful. So are these restrictions issued by Italy, applying to all leaving foreign visitors, or just those flying to the US, do you know?"

"Its our last day in Rome and apart from the odd Chinese tourist wearing masks you wouldn't know there was a virus in Northern Italy.As for tourist sites being dead- nope still losts of tourists here and there are still queues for the colosseum and the forum. It was funny Monday they had a tv crew waiting to video the ticket office, as soon as the crew dropped they filmed it. Glad we came, lovely food, great culture and walked out socks off.Virus? What virus!!"
Hi! A question-- flying from Spain to Florence and then out of Rome. How are the airports? Are there more strict checks flying within the EU or is it normal?
I'm suppose to be flying out with my mum tomorrow (6th march) and still unsure on whether to go or not. I really want to go but just a bit unsure obviously with all the scaremongering going on about the corona virus.Are the tourist places open and will there be places to go out for dinner etc.. We are staying in an apartment.Were the airports ok for people coming back to the UK (Glasgow)?You don't have to self isolate if you are coming back from Rome do you its just the north of the country.
If I was you I would go .It is quieter so a great time to see Rome As you are there on a Saturday you will be able to go to the Palazzo Colonna - Galleria Colonna It is only open on a Saturday well worth a visit if you have time opens 9am closes 1 pm
"Anne-Marie T: I'm not aware of closing of ""tourist sites"" in last hours. Since yesterday, you're expected not to be too close to other people as a security measure and to wash your hands a lot (or maybe to wear gloves), but the life in the city goes on, it is not desert and finding a place where having meals wouldn't be difficult. If you prefer to have meals in your apartment, no problems too, supermarkets are regularly open. Anyway, just you can decide if you prefer to go or not, it's obvious"
"Anne-Marie, don't let the scaremongering get to you. Rome has not been tagged as a hot spot. Just use normal precautions such as washing your hands often, using hand sanitizer when not near a washroom, avoiding those who are coughing or appear to be ill. Rome isn't shut down and is operating normally. The only places that I know of that are shut down are the catacombs. This makes perfect sense because they are very confined areas without much air circulation. Go and have a great trip.Donna"
FYI there are several live cameras up in Rome so you can see the activity and the the judge yourself.
"Hi dbabeThanks for clarification.I think Anne-Marie's concern may come from reports in UK(BBC) that as well as schools and universities that cinemas, theatres and museums are also set to close across the country.I hope that is not the case, we are due arrive in Rome next Weds.RH"
"Just a thought- If certain goverments and the CDC and WHO are issuing travel bans and warnings, advising against “unnecessary” travel, is that “scare-mongering”? I dont think so. The advisories are in place to help, not hurt travellers- and to advise not to listen to them in my opinion is not wise. This is a Global health situation that needs Global cooperation."
"""I think Anne-Marie's concern may come from reports in UK(BBC) that as well as schools and universities that cinemas, theatres and museums are also set to close across the country.""Schools and universities has been closed in fact, in the whole country, as a cautional measure. But museums are not concerned in this measure, sure not all the same in the same areas.DemiHale-1: I get your point, but we have heard some scaremongering or anyway uncorrect news these days. And an economic paralysis - worldwide, I don't refer just to Italy - could get much more harmful for the humanity than the virus itself. I understand what you mean but there are some ethical concerns on both sides of the matter."
""" I understand what you mean but there are some ethical concerns on both sides of the matter.""Sorry Aristofane, but from what perspective having a leisure trip under these circumstances is ""ethical""? You also know that many of these people who ""really want to see"" Italy won't contribute to the economy of our country.Economy might get paralized, yes, but a sanitary emergency might be even worse than another recession. And if people won't cooperate, the virus won't stop to spread.Also I notice on these boards the concern is mostly about the destination per se, while it's clear that the major incumbency is represented by transiting through very crowded places, like airports, train stations and museums.Moreover as our focus zones situation has shown, the risk per se is not just about catching the disease but eventually carrying it from a geographical area to another one.Edited: 7:13 am, March 05, 2020 "

It was said that avoiding unnecessary travel is ethical, so, paralyzing economy (not just of Italy, even if Italy will be anyway struck) may be very harmful too.And if ethics is a matter, some people cancelling their travels might consider more often the idea - sorry but I word it very directly - of not asking any refunds, what is not so common seemingly. If the argument is ""I would have travelled if just I could"" also hotel staff, museum staff, guides etc might say ""we could have worked for you if just we could""."
"Only 5 new cases, yesterday. Now 25. As for the discussion, tourism is on top of the list of economic activities affected by this disaster, but seriously... the first question now is how many available intensive care beds we have, in a couple of months we will worry about how many tourist will arrive."
"Not only. Let's imagine, let's hope as soon as possible, the happy day when the WHO say that this virus is defeated. The image of Italy might have become so negative for lots of people than they would anyway be very hesitant to go there."
"No Government in the world or health organisation have advised against travel to Rome. Travel restrictions have only been imposed on 10 small towns in northern Italy. Visiting Rome and carrying out your travel plans, IS co-operating and following official advice."
"Aristofane, you make an interesting point in #445. Last week, we were supposed to travel to Milan and Venice, but instead decided to stay in Rome. I lost my deposits on my AirBnBs in Milan and Venice. I had considered submitting requests for the full refund, given I would have gone there if not for the risk, but decided against it bc of the economic toll this is causing the BnB owners and rest of the travel industry. It simply came down to me feeling embarrassed to ask that of the people who are being directly hit. Now, FWIW, I didn’t have that same feeling when requesting a refund from Trenitalia... I was looking forward to traveling to Venice to support their economy after the flooding. I look forward to my next trip to Rome and other parts of Italy to support the economy when this has passed. I can’t imagine, given the beauty of Rome, and Italy in general, that people will have a negative impression once this virus has passed. Be well."
"Do not make comments about other governments, as the US has issued travel advisory for ALL of Italy. I will follow and cancel my upcoming trip. I will seek/receive full refunds. That is a cost of doing business in the travel industry. I have been to Rome before and it will be there next year. No sense going with all this mess going on."
"The thread has taken a different route now talking about ethical reporting and actions. I was on a land tour with Tauck that my wife and I were in the process of cancelling but the tour operator ended up cancelling anyway. But my perspective and reason for cancelling actually had little to do with the virus in Italy. It was the plane travel and connecting in airports that caused me to start the cancellation process. I’m sure if we were careful in Italy it would be ok, but here’s the thing, not everybody is careful and then we get to spend 12 hours on a plane with someone exposed, we get to the US, they test and we end up quarantined. All flights to the US now everybody is checked any temp over 99.5 stays in Italy. Ok, where do we stay? Hospitals are full, doctors are scarce. Seriously where? So it’s not Italy, it’s the airplanes and the travel. But as I said the tour company ended up cancelling, they felt it wasn’t safe. Our tour started in Naples, then Rome, Florence, Milan, Tuscany, Venice. So we were going south to north. We are scheduled on the same tour next year.Edited: 8:20 am, March 05, 2020 "
"@Ninni the point is different. As pandemic the situation is now, travelling for non necessary reasons might contribute to the disease spreading.@pierl d I throughly agree with you.@Aristofane again, we'll see later. The most important thing now is facing the sanitary crisis. You are worried about the reputation of our country? I am more worried by the fact the whole situation has actually shown how laxist and inefficient can be our country, from the much celebrated Lombardy Health Department to the fact that at least 20 years of despisable politics left our National Healthcare system with no fundings enough.See the glass half full: people these days forget easily, I'm sure by Autumn the tourism industry will be busy as usual.There were tourists in Greece during the bankruptcy, in Egypt during the Revolution, in Paris in the aftermaths of the 2015 attacks: I am sure we can cope with this."
"""It was the plane travel and connecting in airports that caused me to start the cancellation process.""That's a sensitive reasoning and the major ethical matter about the whole situation."
"Julie Q: only part of Italy (up north) is at the higher U.S. alert level, not all of Italy Hopefully, you will get refunds for everything but as is being reported by quite a few posters, not every hotel, tour, vacation rental, airline is providing refunds.Good luck"
"MCat upper is level 4, but all of Italy is a level 3."
I already discussed with my travel agent and yes I will get refunds for all. I can cancel up to 3 days before my trip. Plus I have cancel for any reason insurance.
Did you go? Interested to know.
"Kuroneko: We are not here to talk about politics (what is forbidden, by the way), to make war between regions, or to blame doctors, nurses and other sanitary professionals of Lombardy who are working hard these days to save some lifes are at their own risk.As far I am concerned, I would always prefer to get sick in Italy than in some other countries. Let's remind the Chinese couple who have been staying at Spallanzani since the end of January, going steadily better now, and have been cured by our so neglected Health Department (maybe not all people worldwide know that in Italy any person has the right to be cured in national hospitals for free). I wonder if they say some thanks when they can leave to China back."

Just a few days ago, some people were slamming the idea that might be an ethical dimension to all this...On another note, I'm very strongly in agreement with nearly everything Kuroneko_89 has written today. And again, I can't wait to return to Rome and other parts of Italy again when this is all over. The worst of it is ahead for many of us elsewhere, hopefully the severe measures now being introduced across Italy mean that the worst is - or will be soon - behind you.Edited: 12:33 pm, March 05, 2020 "
How to you access the Rome cameras so that you see the view?
"The advice from the UK has now tightened for ALL OF ITALY:Public Health England said in a briefing on Thursday that travellers returning from all of Italy, not just north, were now being advised to self isolate if they have symptoms. The tightening of the advice is understood to have been prompted by the recent surge in UK cases of people who recently come back from Italy, where the outbreak has escalated across the country in recent days. (Source: Guardian)."
"#464: Donny, you can find Rome cameras and other Italian cameras here: https:/…italia.html"
Thank you Northwest UK1It appears that Rome is still busy with people/tourists.
This was just announced today- Rome is cancelling their Marathon and other large eventshttps:/…index.html
"I am scheduled to go in May and Im keeping my reservations. I wont be cancelling unless things get really out of hand in Rome. We had planned on a day trip to Florence, I may just stick to Rome and Naples. For now, it doesnt sound much different than here at home in Toronto."
"@Peirl d. I see Lazio is up to 44. What's the news there? More family or community spread? Here in the US, it's everywhere. Doctors aren't worried about it though. They said it's another virus. Use good hygiene. If you're in good health, you have nothing to worry about"
"Thank you NorthWest :)""We are not here to talk about politics (what is forbidden, by the way), to make war between regions, or to blame doctors, nurses and other sanitary professionals of Lombardy who are working hard these days to save some lifes are at their own risk.""Coronavirus is also a political issue, undoubtedly. Throwing politics in the discourse is sort of hard to avoid.You know also that I hate campanilismo, thus war among regions is not my aim, I sort of stated the obvious.""I would always prefer to get sick in Italy than in some other countries.""You can say that because you live in Rome. Getting sick in my region or in Calabria is like getting sick in Colombia."
Amen. That's our plan. I just hope that American Airlines doesnt cancel our trip.
I don't think Lazio has any reported community spread. It's tends to be people that have been in the redzone.There have been some articles questioning if the police officer was infected locally or not.None of this means there isn't community spread but that it hasn't sent people to hospital. The virus for most people does not give serious symptoms. The German patient zero is an example of this. Supposedly he was sick for one day and then went around infecting all of Europe.
Thank you nzentena.
"Hi lohsefamily6, 25 in the daily bulletin from the spallanzani hospital at noon. 44 was the update from the civil protection at 6pm.In this moment the local news say 46 cases. Anyway, I think it's obvious that the number will increase. The very slow growth in Rome and Milan surprises everyone and it's the best good news we could have. I agree with US doctors that even if we catch it it wouldn't kill us, but beds here are limited. Health system is free and very good (maybe except the south I agree with kuroneko), but beds are limited."

"#478. As your trip is at the end of May, I think you should not make any decision yet. Based on China's reported numbers dropping, Northern Italy could be back to everyday activity by then. I certainly hope so, but obviously nobody can tell you one way or the other.Edited: 11:19 am, March 06, 2020 "
"We are Americans in Rome currently. We came on March 3 and leave on March 11. I’ve got to be honest: the huge drop in tourism has been, selfishly, the best part of our trip. The sites are slow and calm. Our tours have been small and intimate. We aren’t fighting crowds. I am so glad we kept our trip. There is less Coronavirus in this part of the country than there was in California where I am from. The locals have told us over and over how heartbroken they are about the loss in business due to the sharp drop in tourism. They are grateful we came. Rome is very safe. There has been no community spread here. We are a little worried about being persona non grata when we get home. I think people will be needlessly worried to be around us when we get home. My husband may not be allowed to work. And my children may not be allowed to go to school even though they didn’t even leave the country. We shall see."
"#480 Great first post, Riece M. Very balanced and eloquent 'on the ground' report. Could you keep us updated? I'm sure your compatriots (and others) would be really keen to hear how the rest of the trip goes and what the airport checks are on exit and reentry to the USA. Thank you."
"Although I've been advocating that people consider curtailing travel for the common good, this response is probably the strongest we've seen yet. Not sure how I feel about it, seems quite drastic. But worth sharing in case it's a sign of things to come, and, of course, for the benefit of would-be Czech tourists. (Source: Guardian): The Czech Republic is ordering all nationals returning to the country from Italy to subject themselves to 14 days quarantine, with a fine of up to 3m Czech crowns (£102,000) for anyone who refuses to obey.According to guidance posted online by the ministry:With immediate effect all Czech citizens returning from Italy after 7th March 2020 must without delay notify their GP of the fact by telephone or other means without personal contact.The Czech ministry of health estimates that there are about 16,500 Czechs in Italy.Edited: 2:15 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"Riece - Wishing you continued vacation enjoyment, and smooth success both leaving Italy and re-entering the United States."
"#480, thank you for the reassuring post about Rome. We have an upcoming trip as well on the first week of April for 7 days, I have been looking forward to this trip because it is my birthday wish to see Vatican City and Rome. We’ve made all of the arrangements and put quite a lot of money on this trip. I’ve been tuned in the current events unfolding about the virus. My 70 something mother forego of the plan because of the situation. However, my husband, my sister and 8 y/o son are still planning to go. I’ve been in touch with friends based in Rome and they told me that I should just hold off with cancelling the trip. Your post give me hope and I have banked enough vacation time and sick time to cover a possible quarantine. So for now it is still a greenlight to Rome."
"Italy's COVID-19 death toll has seen another sharp increase, with Rome reporting 49 new fatalities on Friday evening.It means 90 people have died in just 48 hours, according to the latest figures from Italy's civil protection agency.https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/05/two-more…It comes as France announced it was closing creches and secondary schools in two of its most coronavirus-hit regions from Monday.Earlier, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases globally rose above 100,000, according to researchers."
"It is very, very tragic and I do not want to downplay the threat in any shape or form, but this is from the Reuter’s:“”The national health institute said the average age of those who had died so far was 81, with the vast majority suffering underlying health problems. Just 28% were women.The fatality rate from the illness in Italy, which has one of the oldest populations in the world, is running at 4.25%, higher than in most other countries.””"

"Arrived back in the UK last night.Leaving FCO departures there were no checks regarding the virus.There was a call by the captain at Birmingham to ask if anyone had any symptoms as we were waiting for the docking bridge to be connected to the plane doors. Apparently the government changed the policy on planes coming back into the UK.No issues aboard as far as we could see.A fantastic 5 days in Rome.Edited: 7:46 am, March 07, 2020 "
"Just an after thought, there is alot of scaremongering going regarding the virus.Please remember the common flu virus killed nearly half million world wide and had 25% death rate.Things in prospective is what is needed."
The flu doesn't kill 25%. My guess is most of us have had the flu more than once. At 25% we would have died a few times by now
Sorry my phone keyboard.2.5 % a year with the common flu.
"The mortality rate for Coronavirus has been estimated at anywhere between 1% and 4%, depending largely on how many people are tested. At the moment in Italy, the percentage is gravitating toward the high side (but only symptomatic persons are being tested, so the total number of infected people is likely much higher, and consequently the mortality rate should be lower).The problem is that Coronavirus appears to be spread with extreme facility, and nobody is protected by inoculation."
"It's not ""scaremongering"" to give information. From the CDC today:https:/…coronavirus-italy"
"We are due to be in Rome 16 to 20 March. We were due to go 2 years ago and got struck down with Australian Flu 2 days before and had to cancel on doctor’s advice. We were too ill to travel. We did get a refund on the apartment we had rented, tried to claim on insurance but flights and tours booked did not reach the excess so lost about £300. Can’t believe this has now happened with Coronavirus. My instinct is to still go but my husband is very concerned, especially as we were so ill when we had flu. Sort of hope the decision might be taken off us if Easyjet cancel flights to Rome but somehow don’t think that is going to happen."
"Hello DesEngland. I understand your concerns, and taking a decision is certainly not easy. For one thing, decide in some days if you can, the situation may change day by day. Anyway, if you think that you (two or one of you) are in not perfect health condition, of if one of you is more than 65, I would not go. We've heard that some travel experiences in Rome went well, but your particular situation, psycological too because of your past experience, may be different.Compared to other travellers worldwide, if you come from the UK you can plan another trip much easier; it's a couple hours of flight and much less cost."
We were coming for my husband’s 67 birthday! Just going to keep an eye on the situation over next few days but really don’t want to let down the apartment owners. We can probably change the flights for somewhere else but the way the virus is spreading who knows where it will be next. We have it in the Southwest of England and could pick it up going to local shops. Although don’t like the thought of having to self isolate on return if showing symptoms.
Nobody can decide for you. Happy birthday anyway.
"There are currently more cases in the UK than there are in Rome (Lazio itself has a population of nearly 6 million). I'm travelling there on Monday 9th so will update you on the situation but I've had friends who have recently returned from Rome with no problems and everything is operating as usual. At the end of the day it comes down to your personal hygiene and to just be aware, particularly if you are compromised"
Thank you that would be great if you could send me an update. We have our tickets for the Vatican and the colosseum. I understand someone has been diagnosed in the Vatican health centre but I believe the Vatican is still open for tours.Hope you have a great time and stay healthy.
"492 ""2.5 % a year with the common flu.""I think it's more like .05% for the common flu."
"Well, we have now 5,000 cases, Lombardy in total emergency, with no more intensive care beds.All Italy only one phrase: Just Stay At Your F**ing Home.And here you read ""Operating as usual... scaremongering..""Unbelievable."
@502 thanks for the dose of reality!
"desEngland: I don't know what the UK is saying, or how old you are, but at a press conference yesterday here in US, Dr Anthony Fauci, head of our National Institutes of Health infectious disease group, emphasized that point in the CD guidelines about the effect of virus on some older people, and said he thought people 60 and over should reconsider cruises, flying and travel in general (not to mention large gatherings of people anywhere). Keep mind that if you are older and do get sick, you have a greater than average chance of requiring hospitalization and even, God forbid, an ICU, and both hospital beds and, especially, ICU beds, are becoming more and more rare."
"QQ2 you have it spot on.Here, our travel insurance won't cover for that treatment if you can get it. That would be a large part of life savings and quality of life thereafter.So where I would take a chance on the travel I can't take a chance on being poor for the last of my life."
"I’ve just come back from Rome. We flew on Sunday 1st and flew back on Wednesday 4th. Like pretty much everyone has mentioned - Rome is completely empty. Absolutely no queues, nobody visiting the sights etc. When we landed at the FCO we were scanned for temperatures. Unfortunately absolutely nothing was done in London when we landed back. A plane full of people who had travelled from Italy and nothing whatsoever...In answer to your question only you can decide on whether it is worth the risk. Now we have returned we are regretting travelling as it has since been designated category 2 and if any of us were to develop any symptoms we would need to self isolate. In my opinion it is not worth the risk.There are currently 70 confirmed cases in Rome.https:/…Edited: 5:46 pm, March 07, 2020 "

"Pier ldI agree with you totally- please do not listen to the “scaremongering” posts- this is a extremely serious GLOBAL HEALTH issue that needs GLOBAL cooperation- Yes tourism and the economy will suffer but in the long run if people stay home or do not “unnecessarily” travel, the numbers will eventually decrease. Sending prayers to all affected in Italy and around the World.Edited: 6:00 pm, March 07, 2020 "
Have a safe trip! We are planning on going to Rome in April. I am hoping that the airlines will not make that choice for us. I'm also hoping that the USA will let us back in after our trip. Without a 2 week quarantine.

Thank you pierl d.I agree. I wonder why people think the virus is not so serious? Their attitude is “I’m ok and I don’t care if I come home and spread it. W.H.O states we are not taking it seriously enough. We cancelled our trip to Italy. We’re sad but relieved we are staying home. This will be a catastrophic event. The experts should be listened to.
Flying Alitalia in May from Miami to Rome.Why has Alitalia not willing to offer us vouchers now so we can cancel our flight?
"Yes, I’m about to cancel our trip too. Not just because of the virus, but plane and train disruptions and cancellations, possible quarantine in another country etc. it has cost us $$$$$$$$ but will replicate the trio once the vaccine is available. So sad as I planned all year for this."
"#513. Yes we cancelled too. Same situation. Changes to flights etc over and over didn’t coincide with accommodation. Don’t give up on refunds. As places are being cautioned, some hotels are refunding. Good luck!"
"This was just announced- Italy is closing ALL Cinemas, Theatres, and Museumshttps://www.wantedinrome.com/news/italy-clos…"
"Even if you can get a flight to Rome everything is changing fast.Today it seems all museums,cinemas and theatres throughout Italy are to be closed.If you can make it to Rome there will be nothing left to see at least not from the inside.Edited: 7:17 am, March 08, 2020 "
Italian government ordered all archeological sites to close until april 3.i have a daytrip to naples today and our pompeii trip was cancelled.colleseum etc are close too.
"Yes everything has changed overnight. Yesterday seemed business as usual. Today everything is closed. Pantheon, colloseum, all museums, all archeological sites. People’s spirits seem gloomy. We are wondering if we should try to go home early or stick it out. We’re not sure. Still not particularly worried about contraction but concerned going home may get worse."
Thank you Riece M - nice to hear the latest from somebody on the spot. I presume that includes the Vatican Museums and Villa Borghese although somebody managed to buy tickets for the Vatican a short time ago.
"Well I think yesterday changed everything at last, because the best health system of Italy (lombardy) has said is running out of intensive care beds, and newspapers kept saying that maybe patients needing breathing assistance will be chosen by age (hope of survival).I am roman and personally I'm not gloomy, I feel quite relieved that finally the government has taken some serious decisions (closing almost everything) for territorial areas before they are seriously affected. Lazio has only 9 persons in IC.So maybe we'll make it before it spreads here too. Thank you."
"#519. It's a government decree that came into force country-wide today, WaltR. Yesterday, museums were open in Rome and selling tickets there and online.#520 pield d - agreed, this is a positive move in the long term. I just wish more people here had exercised more caution earlier and listened to the advice coming from the scientific community. I note that Serie A football matches have now been cancelled too."
"Yes pierl, if such precautions were not considered we could have faced a sanitary crisis nationwide.If Lombardy does not have enough intensive care equipment and professionals imagine how the emergency could be faced in poorer regions here in the South.Edited: 8:40 am, March 08, 2020 "
At least your flight is months away. I’m flying Alitalia in 2 1/2 weeks and they aren’t giving me anything
"Kuroneko, yes I agree it would be a much bigger problem, and probably it's the real reason behind this decision. Anyway the slow pace of the increase, down here, still surprise me. Maybe the different temperatures I don't know. We didn't have any real precaution at work etc. Only today, I hear friends saying that big employers order to stay at home tomorrow, smart work to everybody etc."
We are due to come to Rome in 7 days but think we will have to cancel. I am surprised to see that you can still buy tickets online for colosseum and the Vatican.
"I'm due to fly on Wednesday but having had the 6 nations rugby already cancelled and now the vast majority, if not all, museums closed I think I'll be cancelling too."
"Walt- yes I believe the sites you mentioned are closed as well, although I didn’t personally try to visit them today. We did walk down to the Pantheon and the doors are locked. My understanding is that ALL the museums and cultural sites are closed. Many restaurants have been closing, I’m not sure if it’s due to the virus itself or the lack of tourism. We spoke to some Americans yesterday who had come to Rome from Florence and said restaurants were closing there because there wasn’t enough business to stay open. The energy is quite different, it’s rather shocking to be honest."
"Hi Riece,So sorry about all the closures on Rome. Seems like the right thing to do though...Are churches still opened? If yes, you might enjoy visiting them and enjoying their marvelous architecture. I am completely agnostic, so my recommendation is just for architectural aspects of churches Rome. Pierl d, thank you so much for your updates! My heart is with Rome and Italy, my most beloved country in the world. Stay safe,Nora"
"I just came back from Rome. I made my decision to go Rome 3 hours before my flight. No regrets whatsoever, it was a great experience. As mentioned before, there were only a few tourists around. Business is affected very seriously, some of the shop owners that I have talked with told me that they are planning to close their shops. It was quite sad to see that all their investments has been ruined with something that no one could expect.After arriving back to my country Armenia, they checked all of us with thermal cameras. Today, some people from Health Ministry came to check my temperature. I am actually glad that we are taking the situation serious.Is it worth to go Rome? If it was a week ago, I would say yes. But now since all places are closed and restrictions are getting tougher postponing the trip would be the best decision."
"We would have arrived in Rome today, but took a decision several weeks back to cancel our flights and all. It was clear that continuing to allow the tourism industry not to put quarantine or restrictions on foreigners was bound to lead to rapid spread of the virus. While China and South Korea were impacted, US CDC did nothing. As of last week, CDC did not even have a fully functioning test kit anywhere other than its own labs, where the test results take a week. Now that the US government has woken up after the damage is done, I expect testing to reveal that this virus has spread unchecked for several weeks on the west coast and other places. Tourists are going to shun the US too. Governments try to underplay the prevalence thinking doing so might lead to recession, but not ringing the alarm bell leads to an even worse situation. Once testing includes all those who are recommended by their family Doctor, I expect US numbers to surpass Italian numbers in 3-4 weeks. Many of those who do not have health insurance will not get tested for fear of the bills and they will spread the virus in their communities. Difficult days awaits us here at home. Stanford University has already cancelled face to face classes. It will be the norm soon.Edited: 10:20 am, March 08, 2020 "
"@nearmsp very interesting insight of yours. If it can be of some interest, it's possible that the virus has been circulating unchecked in many other countries, like Germany and France to name a few examples. @pierl That's a very interesting point. First and foremost, historically epidemics tend to have their focus zones while other zones can be touched quite marginally. I think the virus in the North has steadily spread because of the presence of big urban conglomerates intermingled with each other and because of the intense social life people tend to have over there. Think of entrepreneurs working with import/export (China being to many of them the most demanding country), the massive presence of big international companies, the busy, often consumeristic lifestyle. You probably remember what Patient 1 from Codogno did the weekend prior to his diagnosis and all the related memes and the jokes to be found on the internet.More recently Covid-19+ subjects from the original redzone have been found in Alpine resorts just because they wanted to ski, and they'll face a penal sanction for it.Generally speaking, virologists have been telling on heavy rotation how an intense ""vita di relazioni"" does contribute to the spreading of the disease.On the other hand in the South because of scarcity of population outside major urban areas and issues like poverty and unemployement many people really don't do much in their daily life. I sadly think this somehow prevents the disease from further spreading."
We are in the same boat. Due to fly wed for 5 nights.Still not cancelled. Waiting to see if further restrictions will be imposed re travel. Will lose all holiday money paid. We were a party of 9 going too see the rugby.
The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office has this evening officially advised its citizens to avoid all but essential travel to the Northern and Central regions already listed by the Italian Government. That unfortunately does not include Rome so unless that advice changes any cancellations would probably not be covered by travel insurance. I'm due to fly from LGW on Wednesday afternoon but will hang on until the last minute before cancelling in case the advice changes.
"Now that everything throughout Italy is closed, it's the final nail in the coffin for everyone's trips. Those who haven't cancelled yet still, will cancel now."
"We have booked to go on 14th March, and I was still hoping to go, however if everything has now closed, I'm wondering if there's any point. My sister lives there, so would be staying with her, but was hoping to do the sights etc, so I'm now beginning to think we may as well stay at home. Selfishly I'm hoping that the FCO advice changes, as we could at least then claim the flights back on travel insurance, as I can't see Ryanair cancelling them and offering refunds."
"Are people really going to cancel trips just because they can't get into churches and museums?Really?Can't you just walk around and admire it all?Eat some great food in the many great restaurants.Take in the atmosphere.Enjoy not having to fight the crowds?Better still to do what most people who visit Rome don't do and visit places outside.So many beautiful towns and villages to visit and get a real sense of Italy which you would never get in a busy and open Rome centre.Its just an open air museum.Open your minds people.Edited: 5:05 am, March 09, 2020 "
"@536 that's my view, we go a week on Thursday we are both early 40's fit and healthy so not put of by the virus, we only planned one inside visit to go in the Vatican , if that's not open we save a few quid to spend on restaurants etc and means we have to come back again another time, only thing worrying us now is if the restaurants are struggling and closing"
#536. Not helpful. People are cancelling for reasons beyond closed museums. Many are rightfully concerned about protecting themselves and others. Choosing to be cautious and listening to scientific advice (i.e. curtail unnecessary travel) is the very definition of being sensible and open-minded.
"I tend to agree with everything you have said, nearmsp. Your government has been remiss and the people will pay. Unfortunately, many older residents will die and others, as you say, will not pay for testing. It may be too late to contain, but I hope for everyone’s sake, the effects of delay are not too tragic. This will not go away soon. In Australia we are going into winter. Admittedly our winters are mild, but it’s still winter. Not sure what to expect, but I doubt it will be good."
"I'm in the Vatican now at the moment. There's quite a lot of tourists here at present. There's approximately 1500 people in the queue. Most people are staying 1 metre apart, this is occasionally being enforced by the police"
"To Northwest UK1#538I agree with you totally!! Well said!!Edited: 6:28 am, March 09, 2020 "
Hi there! Vatican is not closed? Im going the 16th?!
Same here. We have cancelled our Airbnb apartment and received a refund. I too am partly hoping Easyjet stop flights and we can get a refund. Looked at going elsewhere but seems expensive and where to go. Also looking like we will get refund on tours booked
"I keep swinging, and changing my mind as to what to do, and probably will right up until Saturday. If things stay as is (i.e. if Rome doesn't become included in the 'necessary travel only' area), I'm now thinking we'll go. My sister knows loads of lovely parks etc, and with the nice weather we could have as nice a time just wandering around, and having picnics etc. Myself and husband and kids (9 and 11) are all healthy, but my parents were due to come with us, but being in their 80s I think they'll now stay at home which is a pity.Ultimately it's an ever changing situation, and a lot can happen in a day."
"I received an email from Vatican museums last night saying they will close, we were due to visit 12th March.""Dear Visitor,having acknowledged the decree of the Prime Minister of the Italian Republic of 8 March 2020 art.2 we would like to inform you that, for precautionary measures, from today the Vatican Museums will remain closed to the public.We regret the inconvenience caused and invite you to contact us ( if possible by email at help.musei@scv.va)for or any information or assistance."""
#536Yes. I am cancelling because of closures.We are not the type of people to go to the same place twice so the likelihood of returning to Rome to see the main slights is extremely slim. Plenty of world to see.
we cancelled our trip yesterday. very lucky as not lost any money KLM have been excellent and hotel was free cancellation (always book it like this just in case). really dissapointed but after rugby was cancelled and then they shut all the sites we cant justify spending a large amount of money. feel sorry for those unable to cancel and feeling forced to go but hopefully can some how make a the most of it!
538 North West.I was clearly referring to people who want to come to Rome despite the virus and whos only reason not to come is because everything is closed.I get it that some people are cancelling because they don't want to get the virus.I was saying that if catching the virus isn't your concern and you want to go well there are plenty of reasons to go.This is for people who have booked and will loose money.For those who haven't booked I would say don't of course.
"Sure. Moreover, if you catch the virus, but you were not concerned by catching the virus, you won't trasfer the virus to others. It's been scientifically proved.Edited: 9:10 am, March 09, 2020 "
"""I'm now thinking we'll go. My sister knows loads of lovely parks etc, and with the nice weather we could have as nice a time just wandering around, and having picnics etc. ""Consider how you will get the food for your picnics. Preventing people from close contact means limiting the number of people in the food store at the same time, which is translating (at least in one part of Rome that I am aware of) into lines at the grocery store.This massive closure will impact most aspects of life and living, even outdoor places like Vesuvio national park are now closed."
"Husband and I aredue to fly in and out of Rome May 7 to 22, visiting Venice, Florence, Montepulciano and Cinque Terre in between. Many non refundable costs paid. Some here in the USA act like we’re crazy that we haven’t cancelled. What say you?"
"549 Drop the sarcasim.Of course its better if also those who booked don't go,In fact lets close down Rome by stripping it of all visitors and watch as restaurant after restaurant and shop after shop closes down.P.S Did you notice its also your own countrymen who are selfish by feeling the north to go to the south,Edited: 9:25 am, March 09, 2020 "
Why don't they let you edit more than once here.Of course I meant fleeing the north and not feeling.
We cancelled because we have a mandatory two week quarantine when we get back (one in our party works in a hospital and another heard from the boss the same). Just not enough time off. Crushed but ready to rebook the SECOND the situation improves.
"Watching this topic but feelings hopeless. Its incredbly selfish but was looking to celebrate my birthday in Rome. This would have been my first trip to italy and Italy has been a dream for so long for me.I still havent cancelled my trip May 7-17 but if public gathering, events, concerts, are cancelled or banned I dont see the point to go and stay isolated. My trip also includes Tuscany and Venice."
"We are among those that are watching how everything develops as we had a first Italy trip booked in early May- Rome and Tuscany. I am now leaning on cancelling our flight but will wait another two weeks, Have only paid a deposit on an Air Transat flight so will be cancelling if need be just before the remainder of it is charged to us. very disappointing indeed, but that's the luck of the draw"
"The situation has certainly worsened these last days: not in the sense that Rome is heavily struck by the virus, but in the sense that Lombardy unfortunately is, and all Italy has to follow some strict precautionary measures, in order not to make the national sanitary system to be in a very strong crisis.The matter is also that one can't know what will happen next days, so, if in any case one can't predict future, in this situation it is even more difficult than usual. I wouldn't have adviced to cancel in the last days of February, I would advice to cancel these days for next days. But May is still far, so, if the question is what to do for May, I would recommend to wait before deciding."
"A final update today, we cut our trip short and spent $800 to fly home to America. I would say DO NOT GO!!! The hysteria around Italy is in full force in America and not only will we be asked to self quarantine when we arrive home, my children —who did not travel with us— will be asked to do the same. My daughter is in a school play that will have performances in that time so she is choosing to stay with friends so that she can continue to go to school and be in the play. I won’t get to see her for an additional 2 weeks in addition to our travel while I was away from her. My friends and community members have already been texting me trying to politely ask me to make sure I quarantine myself when we come home so that I do not expose “vulnerable” members of our community. I am frustrated because the Bay Area where I am from HAS MORE CASES OF COVID-19 THAN LAZIO DOES!!! I am truly more likely to catch it at home than I was in Rome. But apparently everyone will be afraid of me and my children, who did not even travel. It is absurd."
"Thank you for the update, Aristofane. Though I am definitely not going to Rome Friday (though hopefully will be within the next year...), I am now following this post in part because I think it's smart to understand what is happening in Italy to prepare for what may be happening in my own country before long. We're already starting to see impacts in the US - I had a conference canceled, There are random school districts across the country with cancelations, food runs, etc. I expect we're just seeing the start of it."
"I'm very sorry Riece. I'm sorry that for the US generally speaking, but, if you allow, I'm also sorry that the idea that ""Italy"" is the absolute evil and the thing to blame every worldwide problem on, seems to last and maybe to strengthen. I'm afraid that, even after the happy day where the WHO can say that everything is over, some people will go on rejecting Italy just because it's Italy. Maybe try to use your experience to try to fight some hysteria and some prejudice."

The vatican museums are closed until april 3rd.https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/amp/news/…
"Riece - What I find ""absurd"" is what you wrote in your first post on these boards, and in this very thread last week, while I was deconstructing our much anticipated Italy trip also scheduled for March:""I’ve got to be honest: the huge drop in tourism has been, selfishly, the best part of our trip. The sites are slow and calm. Our tours have been small and intimate. We aren’t fighting crowds. I am so glad we kept our trip.""https:/…105896325Edited: 1:42 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Ruth K: sorry but I agree with Riece that the described situation is absurd (absurd ""too"" if you prefer). Using Italy, Italians and people coming from Italy as scapegoats of problems, crisis and fears which affect a big part of the world is even more than absurd, it's inhuman."
"Aristofane - We so enjoyed planning for our Italy trip (that was to have begun in 12 days) and hope to eat, drink, and be merry in your lovely country someday. This has become a global issue and it is ""absurd"" that anyone would brag about their ""selfishness"" in benefiting from fewer crowdsEdited: 2:04 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"Aristofane, although I applaud your change in attitude over the last few days, you are still being defensive and irrational with regard to your view that Italy is being scapegoated.Please ramp down the rhetoric and understand that the 'other' isn't the problem here, it's the fear of the 'other' that causes most harm. We are ALL in this together, and there is no blame to be made. Riece, I'm genuinely sorry to hear that you'll be separated from your children for longer than you anticipated. But please do understand that your friends and neighbours are acting out of caution and concern for themselves and others based on numbers and percentages, You've come back from foreign travel in a country that is currently a coronavisus hotspot. Yes, we'll all be hotspots soon enough, but in the meantime it isn't helpful for any of us to try and make this problem a divisive issue. Surely working together will be more effective than looking for someone to blame?"
"I don't disagree, but the situation described when they came back just as ""those from Italy"" is not less absurd (or other adjectives)."
I also am due to go to Rome in early May. My plan is to wait to see what happens during the Easter season at the Vatican before I change anything.
"I have ""changed in attitude"" because I think the situation has changed. As lots of people say since the beginning, we can't predict future and we see day by day what happens and how we feel. Anyway, if there are clues that the situation is difficult worldwide as you say, I wouldn't accept so easily that some people in the US act as if all the present problems came from Italy. Like or not, prejudice is a concrete matter too in all this situation, and rejecting Italy, Italians and people coming from Italy wouldn't change the sanitary problems, but seems to be a problem itself, maybe longlasting also when all this situation is over."
"That’s crazy to think people are blaming everything on Italy. This is an Italy forum so yeah maybe that’s why we are talking about Italy and not China, or japan or ?We cancelled our trip in April feeling it very selfish to put others at risk on the plane, hotels, etc as well as our selves. If we had been going to japan or China or, we’d have done the same."
"#569. If only you could see yourself, Aristofane. Until the last moment, you've been imploring tourists/foreigners to ignore the evidence whilst (at the same time) blaming them for every misfortune this virus has brought. And even at this stage, when you finally seem to grasp the seriousness of the situation, you blame others for being prejudiced whilst you liberally spread imagined prejudice like butter. You even look into the future to imagine others blaming Italians. Honestly, whatever chip you have on your shoulder, it's time to get over it. Nobody is blaming Italy or the Italians for anything.p.s. Apologies to others for showing my frustration on this, I just feel the need to be honest.Edited: 3:26 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"There are plenty of people working overtime (not on this forum necessarily) to blame ""others"" - articles, social media - I find it weird that someone thinks they need to ""applaud"" someone else for a shifting attitude towards this situation - the situation has been incredibly fluid and changeable. I too just a little over a week ago felt differently about traveling there but the situation as it is now and has been recently, is now one that I would personally not choose to travel there - too much at stake for everyone with unnecessary travel.My friends in Italy are all saying they agree with the measures (as extreme as they are) now being taken and a few have expressed irritation with some other Italians going about their social lives (dinner out, going to bars, etc) saying they feel those individuals are being selfish in light of the new reality. Everyone is going to react to what's happening in their own way Here in NYC, we have had numerous incidents (really ugly ones) against Asians and while I have not read of any here against Italians or someone just back from Italy, I have read it has occurred elsewhere. Human nature is what it is - that sort of nasty xenophobic stuff is going to happen whether people talk about it here or not. And, why is anyone here feeling they should dictate what others here can express about the situation?"
"Yesterday was the first time I have considered cancelling our trip to Rome and Amalfi Coast. Hearing that the museum's and churches are planning to reopen april 3rd (Holy Week), I still have hope because we are planning to arrive April 4th. Do you think they will keep everything closed for the one of the most important weeks of the year?"
@573 In sure hope they would if the situation has not improved significantly..
"#572. Yes, well, we should all fight prejudice where we see it, MCat, even if it's something you don't necessarily have the courage to do yourself. Are you really suggesting you haven't noted a xenophobic tone to many of the posts? And on that note, I think you know perfectly well what 'attitude' is code for here. So please, if you insist on talking the talk, walk the walk too."
"All of Italy to be placed under lockdown conditionsThe announcement in Italy spells out the restriction of movement of more than 60 million people.The decree provides for banning all public events, closing cinemas, theatres, gyms, discos and pubs, funerals, weddings and all sport events, including Serie A matches. All schools and universities will remain close until 3 April. (Lorenzo Tondo: Guardian)"
"I believe these extreme measures are assumed to last till April 3rd, is that correct? I like others, have flights booked for April 15th, so watching closely for the next few weeks."
"Yes, until April 3rd. Like you, I'd be delighted if things are 'fixed' by then. Hats off to the Italian government who are doing everything possible to protect the most vulnerable members of society. Tourists could do their bit between now and April 3rd by staying away tbh,"
"Self-isolaton advised for anyone arriving in UK from Italy.Anyone who arrives in the UK from Italy should place themselves in isolation for two weeks, the UK government has said after their Italian counterparts extended quarantine measures to the whole country.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has said:We have amended our travel advice to recommend against all but essential travel to Italy. The safety of British nationals is always our number one priority. The advice is that anyone who arrives from Italy subsequent to Italian government decision should now self-isolate for 14 days. (Guardian)."
"Reading through this thread- I do not feel anyone is “Blaming Italy”- as this is the Italian Forum of course we would discuss all things Italian- but no where did I see anyone blaming Italy for anything- this virus is a GLOBAL issue. If anything, Ive seen many comments praying for Italy and its citizens, and feeling sad for whats going on. So the “blame game” of one particular poster really should stop/ it certainly does not help or contribute to the conversation at hand.For Riece- the US poster who feels its “absurd” to be quarantined once home in the US- you chose to take your trip during a worldwide GLOBAL health crisis. That is the consequence of your choice. Deal with it. Plenty of people worldwide are quarantined in hotels, cruise ships, naval bases, ect. Be thankful your quarantined in the comfort of your own home. Yes, its very sad you cannot see your children, but that is a consequence of your choice to travel during these uncertain ever-changing times. Continued prayers for Italy and all Countries affected by this health crisis. For updated infomation see the link below.https://www.who.int/"
"I was due to fly from LGW to Rome on Wednesday on a 4 day package holiday which included tickets, bought separately, for the 6 nations rugby match between Italy and England. I've been undecided on whether to go or not but the UK FCO has taken that decision out of my hands. Who should I be calling first: my travel insurance company or the company that sold me the package? Will I get a refund on the rugby tickets through the insurance company or do I need to contact the official Italian ticket office where I bought them from?I was really looking forward to going and my heart goes out to the whole of Italy and the number of cases and deaths here in the UK are steadily rising."
"Some people are really questioning why people would cancel a trip because the museums, archeological and historic sites are closed???Why should anybody feel bad for canceling due to that?"
"Personally I can't think of a better time to visit Rome.To experience it as it must have been before mass tourism turned it into an open air museum.Detached from reality.However,at least 100 people in Italy are dying every day because of the virus.Thousands of businesses will close for good because of forced closures and people being told not to go out and for sure Italy is heading for a recession.So if you are feeling self pity because maybe you have paid for a holiday to Italy or you have the dilemma of whether or not to do so then spare a thought for those who are really suffering and remember how lucky you are."
"Lazio regional health system said they are struggling to create new intensive care units for when the wave arrives. Still 100 cases now, nothing. The national peak is expected in one week after the new measures. As I said everybody should stay at his home, a few days ago, now it's a law, really hope readers follow our advice and not other voices who are clearly not conscious of what's happening. Or maybe they are but have interest. For a forecast, well, Chinese used force, not suasion, we still say people can go to work :-) and also we are not disciplined like chinese. So if they see the light in 2-3 months, I guess half June we'll be fine."
"Well said, pier id. Some airlines and countries are now stopping travel to Italy to help with the shutdown. That at least will stop some of those tourists intent on ignoring good advice. Stay safe, and hope you and yours get through the next few weeks unharmed. We appreciate your honest voice in all this, and hope you'll keep plugging away to get the right messages out. Buona fortuna a te."
"Firstly, we love Italy and have visited several times. Agree with you and pierid especially in your posts of #584 & 585. We are booked to fly to Italy on May 31 from Miami. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that this virus would be fully gone by then such that it would still be safe to travel nor would the anxiety levels be less. So my question is why is Alitalia so reluctant to help me make other arrangements at this time, for example, issue a voucher or refund."
I am also booked to fly with Alitalia the third week of May. I haven't heard anything from them. Perhaps they figure things will be more under control by then and are waiting? I did not get flight insurance.
Are Italians unhygienic?! Italian people don’t wash their hands?!Some posts in the Japan forums seem to celebrate the tragedy in other countries and it makes me crazy. People really believe these things?! I had the most amazing vacation in Rome and Bologna recently (December to first week of January) and stayed in the cleanest hotel & apartments ever. I also saw Italian people washing their hands. I’m sad to see Italy going through this and it hurts me more to see Japanese people happy or relieved about it. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29818…
Please post what you do . Our trip is early May and things could be very different then. I’m very interested.
Hi. I’m in the US. Booked to go early May . We did buy trip insurance but it does not cover coronavirus . Please post what you do .
"Same with us with United. Just no change fees extended thru end of April. Rest of our tours, hotels prepaid so we’ll lose that money if we cancel."
"That’s very true. Point well taken. But museum closures, pantheon closed , Vatican , restaurants close 9 pm makes it a very different situation for our dream trip. Also thinking tourists will tax the already burdened Drs and hospitals if anything happens to us/ them. We are high risk and will check back closer to our trip."
"# 586, 587You are of course absolutely right in being concerned and even disappointed with the response of the airlines. My sense is that all airlines are being as ""tight"" as possible in giving refunds and making other financial accommodations. They may be hoping that the situation will improve before early summer, or they may simply be trying to conserve as much cash as possible, because there are certain to be airline BANKRUPTCIES in the offing. Bear in mind that Alitalia has already furloughed one-third of its workers, and Lufthansa in cancelling up to 50% of its flights (which means massive furloughs and 150 grounded aircraft). The entire airline industry is going to suffer the worst financial losses in generations."
"Donny S: No one knows yet what will be happening by the end of May - it is over 2-1/2 months from now. Who knows what will be occurring where you live let alone what may be going on in Italy at that time. As this has been progressing, airlines and others have been adjusting their refund/change policies - so, one just needs to keep checking. Like everyone else, I so hope this current situation is short lived in Italy (and, elsewhere as things worsen in other places) - that everyone remain healthy and safe. Italy will be there when this terrible time passes - I can't imagine it now being enjoyable for visitors to be there, it is sadly deserted but people (the ones I know who live there anyway) there are being responsible and so, hopefully, these drastic measures will reduce the spread of the virus. Received a photo of an empty Bologna yesterday from a friend - saying he had never in his life seen it as such but that he wholly agrees with the decisions that have been made even though it is seriously hurting his business.Just heartbreaking - for everyone."
# 592Bars and restaurants are allowed to stay open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. (NOT 9 p.m.).
Will wait until mid April before contacting Alitalia or hopefully they will make a decision before then. We also have trip insurance but it only covers you medically if you get sick. Let's all keep each other posted.
"Yes agree with all comments that it is heartbreaking for Italy and everywhere that it is infected. Let's be patient, prudent and wait and see."
"In this situation the only policy that will cover you is the cancel for any reason rider. I would call the airline and demand refunds in a polite way, if you did not purchase that type of insurance but there is no guarantee. I am booked in late april for my sister-in-laws wedding but she won't have any choice but to cancel. This is a very troubling time.Edited: 12:05 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"Personally, I'm becoming more hopeful that Italy will get this under control relatively soon. Looking at the scientific modelling that's been taken from Wuhan and elsewhere, the number of cases in Italy *should* peak this month.How long the fallout continues re travel and tourist numbers is another story, but again, Italy looks like it will come out of this relatively well in terms of public perception. That's my take, at least.Rome was our last foreign trip (Jan) and I'm now committed to it being the next one too. We've cancelled our Easter trip elsewhere, and itching to get back to lovely Rome and the lovely Romans."
Vatican authorities have closed St. Peter's square and St. Peter's basilica to tourists. There are no Masses being celebrated.Italian authorities have also sealed off the Trevi Fountain.Here is a video showing life in Rome today:https:/…
"#600 Sensible, especially Trevi Fountain. Been watching it on webcams over last few days and it remained relatively busy compared with other tourist hotspots in Rome. Remember those posters just two days ago saying it's a great time to go to Rome due to lack of crowds...?"
I was told that cancel for any reason also does not cover coronavirus . Please make sure. I spoke to my travel agent and said I should have gone with That policy instead of mine- that’s when she told me.
Agree. I’m hoping that travel agencies and Italian Hotels and tour groups will Work with us all to postpone travel. Seems like Italy doesn’t need to tax its hospitals and Drs further.
Agree a hundred percent.

"Thank you northwestuk1 for your kind words. Today for the first time big changes in daily life, something we never seen before.. Nobody gets near to each other, empty streets, queues outside supermarkets because of controlled entries, all TV channels repeating it's a war and to stay home for your country and for elderly. And finally we got smart working from our office until April...Let's hope for the best, after all we are eternal city :)"
I'm watching Italian TV.They showed Milan and Rome and both are like ghost towns.It has to be seen to be believed.
"Replying to #606This is not true. The quarantine is to PREVENT further spread, NOT because there is already wide spread infection. By preventing movement they are hoping to continue containing the virus geographically, as China has done. It is unfortunate that so many do not understand the difference. I expect the US will do this at some point, prevent movement in order to contain the spread geographically."
"Thanks for the update pier id. Again your words put things into perspective. The war metaphor is a bit shocking, but understandable - and I guess it has the intended effect of getting people serious."
I feel bad for all those people who make a living in tourism.My husband and I both do and after 9-11-2001 it was horrendous. We had to lay off so many employees.
This will be worse than 9/11.
agree much more far reaching than 9/11...the aftermath of 9/11 was more psychological fear of travel...this is much different.
"Still, so many people whose livelyhood is based on tourism will start losing everything."
"""In Rome, water cascaded out of the usually mobbed Trevi Fountain, but there was no one around to see it. Hardly a soul moved through St. Peter’s Basilica, and the government instructed tourists to go back home or to their hotels. People lined up outside supermarkets, where only a few shoppers were allowed in at a time so that the decree’s social distance rules could be observed.""This is from a story posted on NY Times website."
"RieceDo you work for the CDC or the US government?? If not, then you are certainly not a expert on the subject....and fyi NY today announced they are bringing in the National Guard to set up a ""containment "" field so to speak, as a ""hotspot"" is currently in New Rochelle, and they are trying to stop the spread- I really don't care if there are 60,000 or 6 people in Lazio or anywhere else- at this point NUMBERS are irrelevant!!! https:/…Your posts in my opinion continue to try to inflame and cause drama unnecessarily, and are a bit ""me, me, me"" and whiny...YOU are not paying attention to facts, and yes since people are dying at a alarming rate there IS fear, and justifiably so!!! Perhaps you need to look up the Spanish Flu of 1918 and read up on some FACTS!! Perhaps if travel had been banned when this all started in DECEMBER, it would not be soo bad now...perhaps YOU are being ABSURD!!!As always, continued prayers and well wishes to Italy, and ALL the countries/citizens of the WORLD dealing with this ever changing Global Health Issue.***It seems like you have only just joined this forum in Jan 2020 and the ONLY posts you have made (total of 6) are on this virus, and nothing else travel related...reviews, trip reports, ect. hmmmm***Edited: 10:11 pm, March 10, 2020 "
"I feel bad for all the people in Italy, especially the really infected areas, it must be so scary and worrisome. Im hoping things will settle down soon . My trip is supposed to be in May. I would be looking forward to visiting all the lovely resteraunts and contributing to the economy. For those living in Rome..how are you feeling with this recent shut down? My thoughts are with you all...STAY SAFE"
"#616 says ""at this point NUMBERS are irrelevant!!!""Mmmmkay. I think you have done a better job of illustrating my point than I ever could. Grazie.As for my post history, I have never traveled abroad before or used TripAdvisor. When we were making a decision about whether to go on our trip or not I came across this forum and people's ""on the ground"" accounts were quite valuable so I wanted to pay it forward. If they seem ""me, me, me"" to you, that may be because they are posts about MY personal experience with the topic of this thread. For the record, my ""whining"" is not about the travel restrictions or quarantine measures in affected areas. It's about irrational assessments of risk and emotional reactions, such as yours, that have nothing to do with facts. The EU has open borders and SWITZERLAND is geographically closer to the ""affected areas"" of Italy than Lazio is-- and yet there is no fear of travel there. I believe Italy's quarantine measures are probably wise and if my trip had been a few days later, we obviously would have canceled."
977 people confirmed as having the virus yesterday.1797 the day before.1492 the day before that.Maybe the controls in Italy are working.Personally I think/hope the numbers will be no more than 600 today.Let's keep our fingers crossed.
"Here I am in the UK and everything is normal apart from some idiots stripping the supermarkets of toilet paper and pasta.Yes the virus is all over the news and yes the media have been trying to panic people long before the numbers here and everywhere else got high but they always do.So whilst things here are normal,its difficult to comprehend the situation in Italy.So surreal,so incredible.Like something from a film.I spoke to someone in Rome last night who lives by the Spanish steps and when she went out to take her dogs for a walk the streets were empty.The light at the end of the tunnel is that we know that things will be back to normal in a few months.Maybe even 6/8 weeks.I hope so."
"#619. Cautiously good news, Sanrella. Hope so too!"
"Well the thing we didn't understand until now is that yes, only a few risk their life, but this is valid until you have hospital beds. Now that some of the best hospitals of Italy and maybe Europe (Lombardy) have nearly finished their ICU and say will only cure the young, this detail was finally said on TV. It took 3 weeks. Lombardy first said don't stop economy, now they pray the PM to shut completely. Tomorrow probably a new decree coming to shut all economic activity except food industry and pharmacies.Numbers of yesterday were good but no one of experts took them seriously, they said that some regional laboratories did not send data. If they were confirmed in a few days, it would be great news!Not only tourism, all economic activities will be not working for a while, and funded by the government. I don't want to be pessimistic or to scare anyone, but everybody should realise that when hopefully we will be recovering, il will be our turn to shut borders with other countries in emergency.Edited: 4:52 am, March 11, 2020 "
"To Riece from CaliforniaHere is your first post dated March 6 Riece M  7 posts480. Re: Is Rome safe? Coronavirus Mar 6, 2020, 12:05 PMSaveWe are Americans in Rome currently. We came on March 3 and leave on March 11. I’ve got to be honest: the huge drop in tourism has been, selfishly, the best part of our trip. The sites are slow and calm. Our tours have been small and intimate. We aren’t fighting crowds. I am so glad we kept our trip. There is less Coronavirus in this part of the country than there was in California where I am from. The locals have told us over and over how heartbroken they are about the loss in business due to the sharp drop in tourism. They are grateful we came. Rome is very safe. There has been no community spread here. We are a little worried about being persona non grata when we get home. I think people will be needlessly worried to be around us when we get home. My husband may not be allowed to work. And my children may not be allowed to go to school even though they didn’t even leave the country. We shall see.""

If not, then you are certainly not a expert on the subject....and fyi NY today announced they are bringing in the National Guard to set up a ""containment "" field so to speak, as a ""hotspot"" is currently in New Rochelle, and they are trying to stop the spread- I really don't care if there are 60,000 or 6 people in Lazio or anywhere else- at this point NUMBERS are irrelevant!!! I guess I was not clear- my statement about numbers meaning this: whether 60 million or 6 million people are in Lazio, at this point the number of POPULATION is irrelevant as the virus continues to spread, is deadly, and there is NO CURE- or Vaccine at this time. YOU were trying to compare the number of POPULATION in Lazio to that of CALIF and the US- which in my opinion makes no difference- but please don't twist my words or only copy and paste half of the story- copy it all!!"
"Good point, pier id. When Italy does show an 'official' slowdown, it's likely things will be gathering pace in other countries, forcing Italy to suspend entry rights... Yet another argument for people to curtail all unnecessary travel right now."

"I don't get the criticism towards the Italian government not acting fast enough.I don't see other governments acting any faster.In the UK we have done NOTHING.Boris is waiting for things to get really bad before he takes action because clearly the governments only concern is the economy.In France,Germany and Spain where they are many cases I don't see huge lockdowns either."
"I have not seen any posts other than praising the Italian government- I think they are doing the best they can do under the circumstances, and am sure they have the best interest of their Citizens at heart."
"Riece MYour posts were not about Italy having quarantines, but you being quarantined back in the US when you got home- which was indeed very whiney in my opinion, especially on a thread about the Global Health crisis, not a ""on the ground"" trip report."
Pier idThank you for your posts regarding the current situation and Global Health crisis happening in real time in Italy- continued prayers and positive thoughts go out to you and your beautiful County!
"SanrellaThey announced today that in New Rochelle New York (USA) the Governor is bringing in The National Guard to quarantine a ""hotspot"" that currently has over 100 cases to try to stop the spread of contamination. Hopefully this will help, although they are in unchartered territory as I do not believe this ever has been done in the state of NY. https:/…"
"Demi they are doing the right thing.100 in what I assume is a small area is alot. I know NY state because I spent 3 months in Catskill.This will be a huge learning curve for the world.From this we will learn so much how to control and contain a virus because I assume it will happen again.I pray that next time its not a virus that is far stronger and contagious than this one.What a nightmare that would be.Edited: 6:46 am, March 11, 2020 "
SanrellaI absolutely agree- as the virus is rapidly spreading across the USA- I will be watching (and praying) for NY closely to see if they can contain the New Rochelle hotspot.
Demi the USA reported just 22 new cases today.Not every country is on the same trajectory as Italy.Infact most it seems are not.
"Sanrella, the US isn't being the least bit proactive when it comes to testing. They are only testing after someone reports showing symptoms. I think the numbers of infected are grossly underestimated. I'm afraid things are really going to explode here over the coming weeks."
"Perhaps the bane of Italy was the huge number of tourists visiting. Thousands upon thousands of Chinese tourists were visiting Italy all over the country and infecting everyone everywhere a month ago. It would therefore not be surprising to see skyrocketing numbers now.In short: Mass Tourism is as much to blame for the Coronavirus outbreak as the slow response of government.Edited: 10:20 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Daydreamfarmer good point.Infact unless you test every single person in every single country then how can you possibly know how many people have the virus???On the other hand if for example in the UK there were 10.000 people with the virus that were unknown then I would assume that many elderly would die and we would know the reason.Having said that despite Germany having around 1500 cases for some strange reason they have had only 2 deaths,"

Will do . Please let me know. We have a trip planned for early May. Thank you!!!
"As of today, 125 positive in Lazio. 15 in intensive care.I read in the ""general threads"" on Italy Forum, people posted the daily official update, with a huge amount of new contagions.That ""terrifying"" number is not correct. As I said, it has been officially confirmed that yesterday's data was missing a lot of data from laboratories. Today's update includes also many cases of yesterday.I cannot reply to those 3 threads, I don't know why.Edited: 2:32 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"So not as positive as we were hoping yesterday, pier id. :( The Guardian is reporting what appears to be a serious increase (Italy, not Lazio): ""The death toll from the coronavirus in Italy rose from 631 to 827 in a day. At the same time, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country rose by more than 2,000, from 10,149 on Tuesday to 12,462 today."" Not good. On another note, whether or not sights in Rome will be open seems such a trivial matter now. This unfolding crisis - now officially declared a pandemic by WHO - is having a huge impact on people's lives. It's a little unnerving to witness how myopic many people still are, Keep well."
"The bigger issue - well, beyond whether sites in Italy will be open - is what the situation will be where you live. We are just at the beginning of this in the states in learning the extent of it (given how few people have been tested so far)I all was up for a Spring trip back to Rome late next month - up until even just about 10 days ago; now, with everything closed, the spread of the illness, the heavy burden on residents and no idea what the next phases of this tragic situation will be, I can't imagine going now as much as I would love to support my friends there and the many businesses - People will make their own decisions about this - but the situation is so fluid, keep a close eye every day to try to make the most comfortable decision for you, keeping in mind how vigilant Italy is being about people abiding by the restrictions put in place (i.e., fining people for skirting the new rules, etc) Italy will be there - has been for thousands of years - hopefully, we can all go soon enough and actually enjoy our time there vs. worrying about picking up the virus and spreading it to others or being quarantined upon returning home.How much fun would it be to go now? I can't imagine - people there are truly struggling with their new reality, hoping it will not last long but no one has a clue what will happen."
"2313 new cases today and 196 deaths,The worst day so far.Incredible.I had hoped after 977 cases yesterday that the new rules were working but probably its too early and needs some time.For sure Italy will go even stricter."
Sanrella the amount of new contagion today is not right. Half are from the day before. Ciao

What the hell does it matter if some cases are from yesterday and if some of yesterdays cases were from the day before ??????!!!!!!!!!!!!! They release figures every day for a particular period and the last set of figures say 2313 new cases !! Get over yourself
My god santella you must be strange guy. Because of the daily increase. The curve changes.Can you get it?+500+1500Makes a mad daily percentage today.Now we know it was more or less +1000 a day. It'regular increase. There was NO JUMP today. You have serious problems.

"This evening, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte addressed the Nation to communicate new harsh measures to combat the spread of Coronavirus:Effective tomorrow, March 12, and continuing for at least two weeks,ALL RETAIL COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES (including restaurants and bars) will remain closed, with the exception of pharmacies, grocery stores, and essential public services.Banks and other essential public services will remain open, and transportation links will be continued (although likely on reduced schedules).People are to remain indoors, and may leave their homes only for essential reasons such as to go to the pharmacy or grocery store. Obviously, this means that all tourists still in Italy will need to very promptly return home, since no one will want to stay in their hotels for the next two weeks."

You might want to pass that on to the gov't.
"#666. I don't fancy the chances of things being anywhere near normal by then. As you've suggested - and pier id alluded to earlier in the thread - even if the current lock-down isn't extended, there's a good chance that because of the situation in other parts of Europe, USA, etc, Italy may be enforcing its own borders to outsiders. And even if not, many airlines and other businesses essential to your trip will be affected well beyond any official date. And of course, spare a thought for what people in Italy will be going through between now and then. Where are you from? I'm guessing you should be worried about the situation at home too...Edited: 4:28 pm, March 12, 2020 "

We will see about the US and UK. The fire will tell. It is much better to refer to official announcements than rely on the opinions of travelers from afar.
"I agree. We’re not getting accurate information in US, I know friends who were exposed, have symptoms and cannot get tested. We will never know the numbers. I feel for all of us- all countries and pray it’s not as bad as news reports predict. ButI think we should each do our best, rely on our communities and Im praying for all affected. I’m staying close to home for the next few weeks. Taking a pause as much as possible. And breathing."
Sorry. It actually has been reported again .
