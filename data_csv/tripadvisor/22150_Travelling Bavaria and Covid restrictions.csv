"Good morning, I’m due to fly from the UK to Stuttgart on 1st August. We are then hiring a car and travelling to Rothemburg, Fussen, Berchestgaden and Munich. We are waiting for the announcement that an air bridge will be agreed between UK and Germany. What I would like to know is what restrictions are in place currently in Bavaria, ie can we eat out at restaurants, go to bars? Is there any social distancing measures in place? Do we have to book in advance for restaurants? Also any other vital information would be appreciated. Thanks in advance :)"

"If you plan on seeing the interior of Neuschwanstein, you should buy your tour tickets in advance, on line."
"Restaurant are open but not all, for the more popular ones you will need to prebook. You will get a form to fill in when you arrive or possibly the app for your phone some use one some the other. You need to wear a mask when entering ,leaving or walking around.Friends that were recently in Rothenburg said only 30% of restaurants were open and they were fairly quiet. Currently in Stuttgart bars are allowed to open until 1AM am not sure about Bavaria. In Berlin last week it was until 4 ,each state has it's own rulesEnjoy your holiday"
