And your point is?
"Not a travel -related postSuited for social media, but not Trip Advisor"
You don't think a headline like that might scare away tourists?
Just fake news from people angry at California !
">>You don't think a headline like that might scare away tourists?<<<Probably the Trump ball washers, but that is ok."
"As my Grandmother always told me: ""When you hear 'gloom and doom' predictions, always CONSIDER THE SOURCE. Fox news? Really?I'm not sure which is worse: the proliferation of 'fake news' or the millions upon millions of people who believe it. Let's look at all of the ridiculous assertions made by ""TV Personality"" Pinksky:""Sanitation. Rats have taken over the city."" Really? I wonder if Pinksky has ever been to Manhattan. When I lived there, it was an EVERYDAY EVENT seeing rats in the streets routing through garbage. I cannot recall the last time I saw a rat in L.A. ""Taking over the city?"" Uh, no.""We're the only city in the country, Los Angeles, without a rodent control program."" Hello, we don't have a 'rodent control program' because we don't have a rat problem. Do you actually believe that homeless people bring rats with them into the city? Or, sleep next to piles of trash that are ridden with rats? Really?""We have multiple rodent-borne, flea-borne illnesses, plague..."", Hold up. Knowledge is power. Here is everything you need to know about the plague:theconversation.com/plague-outbreak-where-do…It is preposterous to think that plague could erupt among the homeless population (see the above link) but, as always, people who are scared of anyone who is 'not like me' are eager to demonize such persons.""...typhus. We're gonna have louse-borne illness."" Again, educate yourself. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhus""If measles breaks into that population, we have tuberculosis exploding."" Uh, no. There have to be very specific conditions under which tuberculosis grows out of measles. None of these are present among the homeless population in L.A. Read: (from PunchNG.com):""Usually, measles does not kill but it could get complicated. The symptoms associated with it can make it complicated and lead to mortality. There can be rashes on the body, and peeling of the skin which can open the skin up to infections. Also, people that have measles can have diarrhoea and vomiting. It also affects the respiratory system; it can also lead to pneumonia. A lot of children that are exposed or at the risk of measles have borderline nutritional status. The measles can tip them into full blown malnutrition and complications of that. They can lose a lot of Vitamin A which is important for the vision and so it can lead to problems with their cornea and even blindness. With a depressed immunity, a person may also be at the risk of tuberculosis. Measles can also affect the brain; they can have measles encephalitis leading to the destruction of brain cells. These are short and long-term stages of the disease. Some people can also have sabacute sclerosing pancephalitis which is a long-term destruction of the brain cells which could lead to death. A patient will typically get better from measles after about four to five days but once the patient is entering into the second week of the illness, it is usually due to one complication or the other.""To answer the poster's question about scared tourists: ""The type of people that would be scared by this type of Yellow Journalism are the same types of people who wake up every day worried about people who are 'not like me' whether they be a different race, religion, ethnic background, sexual orientation or having a different political belief system. I trust that the poster falls into this same category because, after all, if he didn't buy into this propaganda, he wouldn't have posted it in the first place"".Trust us, donnier, as FDR told the American people during his first inaugural address 80+ years ago: ""[The] only Thing We Have to Fear Is Fear Itself"" Don't be scared and don't be so gullible."
"The link to Fox News probably made most of us ignore the content. I saw this one recently and has more facts:https://www.nbclosangeles.com/investigations…People here on TA ask about homelessness in SF more but at least as far as I know, no rat issues in SF. Seems like in LA this is happening out of the core tourists areas.Edited: 1 year ago "
Did you have a travel question?
"I just read chogs comments... oh boy where do I begin. So many WRONG information. Linking wiki and other questionable websites does not help.I am a healthcare professional and went to graduate school and practice clinical medicine. First.... measles can cause more TB because individuals who are infected with measles are immune depressed. So if someone has latent/non contagious TB, they can develop active/contagious TB if they are infected with measles or have other medical conditions which suppress their immune system. This is why people have to get TB testing done before they go on long term immunosuppression for other health issues. Please read CDC resources for plague and measles information:https://www.cdc.gov/plague/index.htmlhttps://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.htmlFACTUALLY ACCURATE and SCIENCE BASED information matter.But back to the travel related slant, I don't think visitors going to the usual tourist places have anything to worry about at this point.Edited: 1 year ago "
"According to Orkin Pest Control, the rattiest cities in the USA are Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. But guess what? Atlanta is in the top twelve so keep your eyes peeled Donnier, might be time to do some rat-proofing around your house."
"Oooh, Dr. Drew said something, OOOOHHHH! Scare away tourists? If I lived in Georgia, I'd scare up crud, too because any smart woman of Georgia will move here in order to ensure they have the right to their own bodies. Go ahead and become the incel capital of the country, it's where your state is heading."
"""You don't think a headline like that might scare away tourists?""I kind of hope so. Don't get me wrong we love visitors, and we are very happy to show off are wonderful state. But right now with the economy booming, and record tourism, we are getting loved to death.We have shortages of housing, hotel rooms, workers,and office space. Prices are sky high, and all this makes the homeless crisis worse. So if we get a few less tourist, I don't think anybody will complain."
"Guys, I always get uneasy when people solicit medical or legal advice. That said, I think we all need to be mindful to avoid discussing political issues. Remember, this is a site where people go for travel advice. I think the TA admins made a mistake when re-opened the original thread which they shut down very fast. The beauty of TripAdvisor and sites like this is that you can bypass the authoritative sources and speak directly to locals. When I lived in downtown LA years ago, I remember reading the LA Times and realizing they had no idea what was going on in my neighborhood. This despite the fact their HQ was blocks from my home. Every day I learn little details about Southern California. I greatly appreciate the generosity of the various contributors. But, if you think we disagree about travel advice, just wait until we start talking politics. I PM'd the original poster when I saw the original post to see where they was coming from. Seemed like a typical visitor looking forward to their visit. They were found the news story odd. For those that don't remember, there was a typhus outbreak at City Hall a few months ago. This was reported across a wide spectrum of media outlets. Last year, there was some outbreak in San Diego. (I don't remember the details.) As a visitor, when you see these things, it makes you wonder. Obviously, the original poster could have been a bit more articulate. I agree, Dr. Drew's expertise seems minimal. The piece was probably conceived by his PR firm for reasons unknown. Maybe he was looking for a job. His long-time gig ended a few years ago. Often, Californians self-confidence that their social policies are obviously correct belies the fact often we are running a social experiment. Extending a little grace for the duration would likely pay dividends in the long-run. Certainly, it would be the neighborly tact to take.Edited: 1 year ago "
Hello...I just found out about the typhus outbreak and I am very concerned. I am traveling 2wks in August with my tween daughter 1st time to California..From what i’ve Read it appears to be a serious issue..A few police officers have typhoid fever symptoms.. What is the true outlook for this problem..As a tourist i’m not encouraged..Any sincere and honest feedback are welcomed.I plan to stay at Anaheim 6 nights..then Hollywood area 4nights and maybe Las Vegas or San Francisco to end our stay.
"If you read the reports, you will have found that this isn't an issue in tourist areas. This is in Skid Row and other homeless encampments areas."
Don't worry about it. These incidents are localized to Skid Row in downtown LA. You are not near this area.
thank you..i appreciate your response..i'm travelling from the caribbean and 2wks in cali is not cheap.
