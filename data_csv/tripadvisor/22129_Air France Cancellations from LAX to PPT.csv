I heard that Air France has cancelled all flights from LAX to PPT until end of September. We are booked for the end of November and now I am getting nervous. Should we wait until they cancel us and rebook with Air Tahiti? I am. nervous pricing will go up as our departure dates comes closer. Checking to see if anyone else is in this predicament with Air France!
I had a flight in Aug and they didn’t rebook my flight but we’re happy to refund. So just keep it in mind. I’d call them and ask and not wait till Air Tahiti fares go up.
"As a comparison, AF/DL officially cancelled my early July flight to a different destination just a week before the flight, even though it was clear for over the month that there would be no flight. Maybe things changed, but “back then” airlines were not interested in canceling flights early even though flights would be clearly cancelled. Because that would mean issuing refunds. It made it impossible to plan anything. I think others who for some reason insist on going to FP on AF right now will be interested to know how AF handles Aug-Sep cancellations. Since I’m considering flying AF next year to FP, I’m curious, too."
I am also booked to fly in November on AF. But I booked it using points so will have to wait & watch what options are being offered to passengers traveling in September.
We booked thru the Chase portal. I am wondering if we can get our points back now thru them and rebook with air Tahiti Nui thru the chase portal. I just want to get to paradise.
