Where in BA can I buy natural non-pesticide mosquito repellent (based on citronella)?I need it for a trip to Iguazu. Thanks in advance!
"Walk into any pharmacy store in Buenos Aires (Farmacity has the best stock) and check it out. If they don´t have it there, I doubt you can find it anywhere else."
I can't remember exactly where they are but there are shops that sell health food and related products .. go to a large supermercado .. and or pharmacy ..
"I didn't need any repellent during my two guided tours to Iguazu Falls in November.If you think you will need it, why not bring one that you know works for you?BTW, love your films, and didn't know you now live in Norway :-)"
"You can find citronella oil at Easy, which has stores in Palermo, Almagro, Barracas and elsewhere.No one should go to Iguazú now without mosquito repellent... they are in the midst of an outbreak (bordering on epidemic) of Dengue."
I have seen today at the pharmacy one made by Chicco for babies containing citronella
"LOL ... you never know where an Italian movie star might be found.I remember in summer, when we would walk into the pharmacy by our home, there would be stacks of OFF and other repellents .. just waiting .sylvie, that would just make me stay home.Edited: 4 years ago "
The whole Province (state) of Misiones is declared in state of health emergency since yesterday.misionescuatro.com/general/…Edited: 4 years ago 
Oh dear that is terrible.
"Yes, and personally I would use the strongest repellent possible right now, which isn't citronella."
"Absolutely, Sylvie!I've switched from Eau de toilette to Eau de Off, for the time being."
jaja... yes! It's so scary with the 4 cases in Capital...
"I had a guest at home who has been to Brasilia, Encarnación and Posadas during the last two weeks.Terrified that a mosquito would bite him and me afterwards, since he's been traveling along what now seems ""the dengue route""."
"I totally understand!! Last night I was bitten at a milonga where there were lots of tourists, and my brain keeps focusing on where they might have travelled. I'm even scared of my friends from Quilmes."
"Uh oh, I am going to Iguazu in three weeks. I think I will bring a nuclear bomb for mosquitoes. Do you think I will have to declare it at the airport? :-)"
Just wear some really awful musk perfume. My husband used to say that some perfumes worked better than OFF and other repellents lol except they repel people too :)Edited: 4 years ago 
"Yesterday, as I walked along Las Heras Parque in Palermo, I saw 1/2 dozen men in Hazmat Suits spraying. They said it was against the mosquitos and their habitats.....I crossed the street to avoid the direct spray - and the unhappy insects. I agree with Sylvie2 that the most effective repellent is called for here and now.....and certainly in Missiones."
PS....I am aware that crossing the street isn't going to fool those mosquitos.!
"It doesn't fool the mosquitoes ??? you mean all the times I ran to the other side of the street, they were wise to what I was doing ? :("
"There are signs in Buenos Aires warning people about Dengue. The major agencies/disease control still urge people to use a product with some percent of DEET. Remember the higher the percent of deet does not give you more protection, it just protects you for a longer period of time. Off with 7% deet will give you 2 or 3 hours of protection where a product with 25% deet will give you 8 tov 10 hours. Obviously if you swim, get rained on, sweat etc. it must be re applied. Anyone who has ever had dengue will tell you to use something that will actually work. It is not something you want.Edited: 4 years ago "
Bah. Heading to Barranquilla and Cartagena in 2 months. I hope it's better by then.
