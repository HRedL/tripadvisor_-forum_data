Just saw Park Hyatt and Peninsula are closed? Are most hotels closed already?
I would think they would.... It is a good thing for now.People shouldn't be traveling.B.
"I know in some countries, like Spain, the hotels are closing to discourage travelers, and to keep people from having to go to work."
I can't imagine anyone traveling for fun right now. I'm amazed the airports are still open.
"There is still necessary travel. Besides business and government, people have to get home. My friends winter in Sarasota, due back April 1. They are not altering anything, just planning to come home April 1. Why hurry back to Chicago?"
Why get on an airplane?
"Well, they have tickets home. I guess they could drive but that's possibly just as dangerous, eating out, staying at hotels on the drive back. I'd rather be on a plane now for two hours then a 20 hour drive in a one way drop off rental."
"My husband's a doc at Advocate Christ Hosp. and stays at the Hilton Oak Lawn when he has to be in early in the a.m. to read EKGs & echocardiograms because we live far north and traffic can be horrible. He's wondering if it's still open in case he has to stay down there (or gets pressed into service at the hospital 24/7). Hilton has a COVID-19 page, but is not specific to any particular one of its hotels. Personally, it might be a good idea to use the hotel to temporarily house non-critical in-patients from Christ or Little Co. of Mary Hosp. to free up hospital beds for the sickest patients."
No. Hilton isn't getting involved in that. They should use the closed schools tho as extra hospital beds.
You might want to talk to your husband the doctor. And wish him safety. He’s already a hero.
""" I'm amazed the airports are still open.""Yeah and still international flights. It makes sense only to have them if they have a stopping point date wise."
"Folksingersandy, yes, I join in Carlo C's ""thank you"" to your husband. This must be a scary & trying time for both of you. Be well."

"They're open. Was easy to book a room for next Thurs. night. Kitchen closed, though."
"""They're open. Was easy to book a room for next Thurs. night. Kitchen closed""Which one you staying at?"
"I think OP said Hilton over there. I’m glad they are open. That hotel is always really busy. I imagine all that hospital, and other business keeps it really busy."
"""Chicago plans to rent thousands of hotel rooms for coronavirus isolation in move to preserve space in hospitals""https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/c…"
"If I get infected, I sure hope I’m quarantined at the Pen and not Ohio Street travelers lodge."
So long as they don't quarantine me at the Trump ....
"Hilton Chicago Oak Lawn--and it'll be my husband, for 4/2. But he's rethinking--since the Exec. Lounge will be closed for the usual free cocktails & hot hors d'oeuvres/breakfasts, there won't be room service, and the roads are empty enough for a (relatively) speedy commute, he may just sleep at home and go to his hospital at zero-dark-30."
I'm sure your doctor husband is happy that the buffet is closed. SMH.
"""So long as they don't quarantine me at the Trump ....""It's a top tier hotel though."
It’s a Trump Hotel though. It is doubtful that that owner would offer his hotel for Coronavirus patients. . I would prefer being put in the Ohio House motel.
"If I was put up at the Trump, I would enjoy it as much as I could. Then, when it was time to leave, I’d steal all the toiletries and towels and give them to a shelter."
"Four Seasons, Virgin, Chicago Athletic Association and The Hoxton and Omni are also closed. 166 (the Mag mile Cambria) is going to become hospital rooms."
Hilton Chicago is closed.
"JordanBulls #21,Yes, some might say such now, but if quarantined at the Trump, they might change their tune - or shelter under the EL, in a refrigerator box?At this point, not too sure that folk have all that much to choose from, but maybe I am wrong?Hunt"
"""Hilton Chicago is closed.""Says until April 21st."
