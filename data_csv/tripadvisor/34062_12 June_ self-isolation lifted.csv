HeyIs it certain that you don't need to do the covid-test before traveling? At least in the official government website that still shows:https://www.belarus.by/en/travel/travel-visas
"belarus.by is not a government website, this one is run by a news agency"
"Check the last link in my post, please - Health Ministry should be official enough.A"
"Double-checked from local Belarussian embassy and they said the covid-test before travel is recommended, so hopefully it doesn't mean that when you arrive to Minsk airport without one they will force you into quarantine :)It's the same with almost every country at the moment, completely clear information is hard to come by."
"You're welcome) Yes, a test is recommended, and is not a must.A"
"Hi Andrei! What does ""recommended"" mean in this context? Do you think it is possible to be forced into self-quarantine if arriving from the wrong country (still on the list) or greeted by the wrong border guard?As a side-note, I have antibodies (tested with laboratory analyzed test) for SARS-CoV-2, which most likely means that I am immune to Covid-19. However, I guess that the negative PCR-test can't be replaced with a positive antibody test?"
"In general, the border guards can deny entry without providing a reason, and I’m sure they can compel quarantine if they suspect you are sick.In practice they are generally most competent and professional, so you should have no problems."
"Recommended in this country means ""not mandatory"" (forget it).From my communication with the interested agencies it seems that if you have no symptoms, you need neither test or self-isolation. Follow my YouTube channel for more updates!A"
"So they have Sweden (!) and Portugal on the list, but not countries with a lower infection rate such as the Netherlands. Yeah, that makes sense...not.That's a pity, we would have loved to visit Belarus later this summer. Hopefully the list will be updated soon."
did they say anything about self quarantine?
"Nothing, Finland is off the lists.Can't say about weekend, but Friday night is a bit stormy in the streets...A"

Hi Can i just check if UK is now on the not having to self isolate for 14 days on arrivalhttps:/… has the uk on itbut the government list does not - although it might be out of dateminzdrav.gov.by/ru/…Whats the final say on whether on/off the above list whether they will insist on testing you on arrival if you havn't got a negative test 48hours before flying to Belarus.Also is life back to normal - can you go to attractions/cafes/pubs/tours and use buses and trains without any restrictionsThanks
"There were no restrictions. UK, USA, Australia, Canada, Japan and several others are off the lists, too. Just fly in and get that airport insurance (covers covid treatment).A"
