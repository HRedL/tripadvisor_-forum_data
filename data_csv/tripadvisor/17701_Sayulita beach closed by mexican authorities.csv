"Well done Mexico! Now, the question is whether or not the local hotels & owners will disclose this."
"OK, that is officially terrifying. Enterococcus faecalis is a very bad dude and it can cause a wide range of life-threatening diseases, it is resistant to many common antibiotics, and can only be killed with strong bleach or hydrogen peroxide. Those little handwipes and bottles of hand sanitizer people are using are worse than useless... https:/…Enterococcus_faecalis. The beach closure is about 5 years too late to save the reputation of this sweet little town."
"I believe this is good news for Sayulita in the long run. It means that those who can make a difference have begun to make addressing this problem a priority. For those interested in the long history of the problem, please read this. www.atl.org.mx/index.php…"
"The article attached by the OP is a redacted version of the official Federal Government article, which states that figures for Sayulita are not yet available. https://www.gob.mx/cofepris/prensa/161038… Here's a link to the very useful blog from WildMex: https:/… I recommend to all our guests that they do not swim at Sayulita beach, that they take various precautions when travelling, and offer full refunds if anyone wants to cancel.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Just looked at the beach webcam. Beach is full of people with many in the water. How does that work? I guess ""closed"" means it's an advisory only..."
exactly...
It would be good to see this beach closure strictly enforced so it really puts the pressure on the town to get this bacteria epidemic thoroughly dealt with once and for all. At least now they can know exactly they're dealing with.
"That's not a true fact, please check the real and official website from the Mexican government!"

it's actually open for all who don't know how it is to ingest Enterococcus faecalis ...
It also doesn't say that there isn't Noro in Sayulita. It says that it tests for Enterococcus faecalis in the water and it was found to be high. Sayulita has more than one problem going on.
chances are it's not norovirus...as you and others assumed we would have a serious multiplication of the problem if the virus would be the problem...and so far nothing...it's Enterococcus faecalis ...and the locals are full of it...

That is false and inappropriate content. Sayulita Beach is not closed.
I’ve been reading a few of the online news sources from Mexico. They are reporting it is under permanent sanitary surveillance. One news source says it’s closed to tourists. All the articles are in Spanish so far. Here’s one link. https:/…
This could be good news as now the issue will be dealt with rather than bickering on chat sites about wether it is or isn't a problem.Edited: 1 year ago 
"I just went to the treatment plant at 6 pm, although it looks nearer completion it is not yet hooked up. Why do people just post without checking?"
"Re: Post #13 - 'This video was taken April 19, 2019 ...'. Really? Next Friday?Edited: 1 year ago "
"I agree with Snorkeler: ""Sayulita has more than one problem going on."""
Right in William. It's NOT about to be Fixed anytime soon.
"Not so quick Amigo.....a setback. Sayulita was putting out 2.3kms of rubber sewage pipe and completed the flotation. They sink and float the sections by injecting air into the pipe or allowing water in. Well they connected a 200m section to the shore stub, and for some strange reason did not sink it? The result is the floating section bashed in all the concrete blocks close to shore and punctured the pipe in numerous places. So they now have five issues to resolve. 1) They have to retrieve the faulty punctured pipe that still has a lot of concrete blocks on it. 2) They have to remove all the broken concrete blocks from the ocean bottom. 3) They have to dig up the beach and find the pipe end that connects to the treatment plant and disconnect the faulty pipe. 4) They have either repair the faulty pipe or consider turning it end for end and use it as the last piece of pipe at the end of the 2.3kms ( a leak in the pipe at 2.2kms from shore is not a biggie). 5) The biggest impediment is likely liability and who pays for more concrete blocks. Each block weighs about 500 pounds and they are spaced about 8 feet apart on the pipe. Its rather amazing to see a 200m length of pipe floating with 40 tonnes hanging off it but all they need to do is inject air into the pipe and it floats!! Anyway, I noticed Friday they injected air into the pipe from shore only to see the first 100m close to shore look like a sprinkler hose with plumes of air/water shooting up into the air. So Sayulita sewage pipe will not be functional for weeks. They hoped to have it done by Easter when the crowds arrive...not now! When they connected that 200m pipe to the stub, all they had to sink it till they were ready to connect the rest.... some engineer is not popular at this time!"
"Safari then you should have someone investigate this website The picture is fake, so maybe info is too, but someone should go after them if it is fake! https://www.milenio.com/ciencia-y-salud/medi…Edited: 1 year ago "
Could be coincidence but seems eerily perfect timing. Businesses were handed pamphlets on Thursday explaining how to combat Norovirus. So someone in the medical world believed the Beach is closed and believed the website I quoted in the last post. There was at least 30 people in cranberry-ish jackets wearing hard hats at the river mouth this morning. So something is up. They also spread a ton of lime all over the riverbed outside the effluent flow.....so someone is getting their pee-pee whacked. The flow is still running unimpeded into the ocean as of today.Edited: 1 year ago 
I find it interesting the Sayulita Beach Webcam https://www.sayulita.com/webcam.html showed lots people on the beach and in the ocean today 14-04-2019. Is the beach really closed or are the cameras fake?

"Information online in various sources indicate the recent water testing results (April 2019) that Sayulita has in fact the worst water in the immediate area but I was unable to find any data confirming closure of the beaches by authorities. I’d be swimming in places elsewhere, to be safe."
"lots of people in the water today. So there is no ""beach closed"" thing. But there were about 30 people from the health department in town today. So there is something to this but it appears they are trying to keep it on the down low"
I was at Don Pedros for lunch today and the beach is definitely not closed. Lots of people on the beach and in the water. The article that was quoted is mistaken and it is not closed. Water authority in Sayulita posted a couple of hours ago that they tested the emissor and there were a few problems but they are working on them. I have been to Sayulita a lot over the past week as friends have been staying there and none of us got sick. Had lunch at Don Pedros today and watched the masters there. It was as great as usual.
"Exactly. Multiple problems. The norovirus outbreak was the bigger one, may have actually hit more than 50% of all tourists last month. The good news is last week it was 10%, and this week seems to be 0. Bye bye noro. But yes, we still need to get the river mouth clean. More good news, the newly remodeled sewer plant should be fully functioning within one week tops. :)Get ready, Sayulita's on the comeback. Still work to do though."
"#2, your link doesn't go anywhere. Better to just post 'don't swim near turds'."
"Do you have any real evidence to support your claims? Sounds like they are a politicians campaign claim. And no, the emissor project has some real issues that won’t be easily solved if the project continues with its primitive project management as so far has been in evidence.I am here and have watched the project on a daily basis for over two months and have not been impressed with its technical management and construction techniques."
"Caver, you've mentioned a couple of times that there were about 30 people from the health department in town but that they're trying to keep it ""on the down low"". Can you please explain what you mean? Thanks.Edited: 1 year ago "
"Also, I forgot to ask: In post #21 you mention various set-backs and things that need to be done to rectify the situation. Can you tell us where you found this out? I've heard a couple of rumours around town but no actual facts. Thanks."
"This isn't true. The beaches in Sayulita haven't been closed by the Mexican Government. In fact, the new sewer treatment plant is operational and amazing. We just spent eight days in Sayulita, two families, 5 kids, surfed and swam in the ocean every single day for hours at a time; we ate street tacos and shrimp on the beach... made coffee from tap water and toured the entire town, played soccer and rode bikes, hiked and hung out. NO ONE GOT SICK. No one. It was a perfect trip."
"This is completely false info. The link shared by the poster is from a website that took the official government information and either paraphrased to suit themselves or simply outright lied. Unfortunately, other news outlets have now shared the same inaccurate story. View the original government piece: https://www.gob.mx/cofepris/prensa/161038…The beach is not closed, and the upgraded treatment plant is fully operational with the new emissor pipe installed and working. This is new information. The emissor pipe was just hooked up on Thursday and they have been running tests to be sure everything is functioning properly. The inauguration of the newly upgraded plant is tomorrow. The government will be testing the water again in the bay after Semana Santa (last test was in December and did not go over the 200 PPM allowed by the government. This is good news, people! Maybe all the trolls who have not been to Sayulita in years and have zero understanding of what is going on in town will now go find something better to do with their time :)"
"Completely untrue, and false information from the website link provided. Read the original post from the government: https://www.gob.mx/cofepris/prensa/161038…Additionally, the upgraded treatment plant is online with the emissor pipe installed and functioning. The government will be testing the water again in a few weeks. The last test in December did not go over the limit set by the government of 200 PPM. Please check facts before posting. I know the original poster has not been to Sayulita in years and has no clue what is going on in town and all the efforts that are being made to improve conditions."
"Great news Val, I think the OP may be full of Enterococcus faecalis."
"Real time update.... amazing. Remodeled plant opened almost a week ago, emissor running, water clear, people walking and surfing. At the moment they are working in the river bed to replace the dirt they removed to install emissor. Construction sign still up as the machine is still fixing the path over the river. Looks like a few days work to me. Sayulita Is now the only beach town in the Bahia that does not put grey water on a beach. We imagined this years ago and thanks to the funding and leadership of Pro Sayulita, a few scruffy locals from Eco Sayulitaand the new government this is a reality. I am jumping for joy. Please share!!!!!!"

Number 39 your so called real time update is wrong. The plant was not up and operating a week ago. Yesterday I checked out the plant and it was still spewing semi treated sewage into the river although closer to the shore. The flow was as strong as usual. The emissor pipe was still not in use to carry the partially treated sewage and the section of the emissor pipe close to the shore had not yet been submerged. I will check again tomorrow morning. False reports damage any credibility the town desperately needs now.Edited: 1 year ago 
Just got back from the inauguration of the treatment plant. Had a chance to speak with the engineer of the project. The pipe is partially floating near shore due to the fact not all the air escaped during the process of submerging it. BUT the plant IS operating and the emissor pipe is NOT leaking and IS being used. The company that installed the pipe will wait until Semana Santa is over before fixing the problem. It is supposed to be a simple fix and they will not get paid until it is done. I personally walked through the plant and it looks amazing!! Estimated to serve the needs of Sayuita for 25 years. Doubled the capacity and almost tripled the output. River bed is currently dry! Ocean is clear!
Treatment plant is operating.https:/…
Too bad AluneluYou are going to have to find some new place to trash.
"Alunelu will be very happy to hear that the problem is over, as is all of us that have been warning people to stay away. I'll wait a bit to see how this new plant works out, then happily return next winter season if all is good.If indeed it is fixed and problem over, I would hope the people that travelled during their spring break from Canada and USA get a free vacation redo from their condo landlords or vacation retailer. They suffered, many saved for a year to get sick.Edited: 1 year ago "
"safari...believe it or not , i would be one of the happiest if this problem solves itself...the surf breaks around the bay will become more manageable once sayulita will be again the most crowded surf place around ...yuck !Edited: 1 year ago "
We had our problems and we have belatedly but with constant ongoing determination now rested control of our sewer plant to local governmantal control from a private cabal. Please look at the water results after just a week of processing by our new plant: https:/… COME TO SAYULITA! THE WATER IS NOW CLEAN. We are working to restore the lagoon to its original beauty. We are all in on this and doing our best to correct our problems now that the shackles of monopoly are shattered! Thanks for your patience!Edited: 1 year ago

"Not true Alunelu- Here are the FACTS:On Thursday, April 11th, 2019, the emissor pipe was successfully installed to the newly upgraded wastewater treatment plant in Sayulita. The Gobernador Antonio Echevarria Garcia, the Presidente Municipal de Bahia de Banderas, Jaime Cuevas, and the director of the CEA (Nayarit’s potable water authority), Martha Patricia Urenda Delgado were at the treatment plant yesterday, on April 16th, to tour and inaugurate the newly upgraded and fully functioning plant and emissor. Sayulita is now the only beach town in the area that does not dump grey water directly onto the beach. Many people turned out today to tour the plant and grounds, and it was great to see everyone involved in the process. There was also a noticeable lack of odor at the plant, which was a pleasant experience. The government of Nayarit also tested the water quality and the latest test results showed between 10 and 20 NMP / 100 ml enterococci, which is well below the 200 NMP / 100 ml limit set by the government for safe swimming.The treatment plant was previously only able to process 20-30 liters per second when both sides of the plant were in optimum running condition, which could not always keep up with the demand due to tourism growth, but it now has now been upgraded to process up to 80 liters per second, which is a huge improvement, and can handle the busiest tourist times, such as Semana Santa and Christmas / New Year’s Eve holidays. With the emissor pipe in place and functioning, there is no treated water entering the river or emptying onto the beach. The fully treated water is instead emitted through a pipe that is anchored to the sea bed and emits the treated water 2.3 km into the deep ocean. With good maintenance, this newly upgraded plant will serve Sayulita for the next 25 years as the population continues to grow. The government is now overseeing the management of the plant, so there will be regular inspections and upkeep.This massive infrastructure upgrade could not have happened without the actions of Grupo Pro Sayulita, who took the initiative to get studies in place, engineering plans, apply for permits, and also the many donors who helped the project get underway. The new sewer line beneath Manuel Navarette, beneath the river bed, and the new storage tank at the plant were all funded by Grupo Pro Sayulita as well as private donations. The newly elected Mexican State and Federal government then took over the project and have been working diligently for months to bring about the completion of the project, which they funded in excess of 41 million pesos.This is the best news Sayulita has received in a very long time; thanks to everyone who stood by this necessary project and donated their time and money to bring about positive change for the health of everyone in Sayulita. There is still more to do, so please consider becoming a member of Grupo Pro Sayulita, or you can always pick a cause and donate directly to that fund. You can donate to Grupo Pro Sayulita here.Local volunteers are already discussing a project to bring back plant life to improve the health of the natural estuary at the mouth of Sayulita’s seasonal river."
"Alunelu, ""I would be one of the happiest if the problem solved it self""??? Seriously??FYI, the problems are getting solved due to hard work, dedication and money put up by the residents of Sayulita whom you dispise so much! Give a little credit where credit is due!!"
"This is completely insane. At no point have these beaches been closed. In fact this week, a brand new sewage treatment plant has opened resulting in today’s water tests at the main beach being the cleanest in the region. Read about it here. sayulitalife.com/sayulero/…"
"Alunelu you said: ""I would be one of the happiest if the problem solved it self""??? Yet now that there is a solution you have disappeared. No congratulations? You seem such an ""expert"" on Sayulita, and yet you are SILENT. (Please excuse my snarkiness in advance!)"
