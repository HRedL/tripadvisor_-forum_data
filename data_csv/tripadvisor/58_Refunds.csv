"We have cancelled our upcoming holiday.Do you think it is possible (and worth the hassle) to apply for refunds for evisas already approved, and two internal Vietnam Airlines flights for four people? I assume we won't be able to change dates to April 2021.Thanks in advance."
I would forget about the visas. Plane tickets I would pursue as Vietnam airlines are quite good. Just depends on the type of ticket you bought. Good luck.

"Thank you manatdollar. I don't think we fit into any of those categories, so I assume that means no refund. As our dates to rebook won't be until 24/4/21 and 28/4/21, I assume we won't be able to change dates, as they are too far out. Do you think it is worth contacting the airline?"
"VA are not replying to communication.I have sent them numerous email, which their customer support and refund people have read, but still I have no response as to the situation taking into account the present position with immigration and FCO directives."
"Well, if your holiday was didn't take place due to Government advice against travel or the airlines cancelling your flights and Vietnam Airlines won't refund you, then you should turn to your travel insurance and see what they say."
"It’s difficult but I don’t think now is the time to pursue refunds...obviously an email contact with the airline/ hotel and insurance company is the first step but during this worldwide crisis everybody has more important things to worry about. Maybe re-booking everything for next year rather than asking for refunds will be the best option, it’s not always possible I know."
"Try this thread... https:/…106211542... basically your domestic tickets need to first be refundable. Based on my tickets all Vietnam Airlines tickets are refundable unless you get one of those super amazing deals but I don't think those show up as a choice of flight unless you are trying to buy a last minute ticket anyway. ... I think (not sure) but I don't think they are charging cancel fees on any of these flights. Most of the refundable tickets have a 300,000 dong cancel fee.... I also did my tickets on their website so I followed the procedure of sending an email to onlinesupport@vietnamairlines.com with ALL the details of the passengers, flights you want to cancel plus a truncated credit card you paid with. I think if you did it through a different source for your tickets you have to go back through that travel agent, etc.I emailed on Tuesday March 24 and expect about 2-3 week window before I hear anything based on all the threads I have read so far. Good luck!"
"Try to pursue refund, email to onlinesupport@vietnamairlines.com with all details I think you’ll get it. I did."
"Thanks for your replies. We have receivd an email from Vietnam Airlines, saying they will refund us, and will get someone to contact us. Not expecting this to come through quickly, but that's ok."
