Anyone know the current status of the Dengue Fever epidemic in Guadeloupe?english.rfi.fr/americas/20100823-french-armyâ€¦
"Hmmmm... it was already on the increase fall 2009 when we visited, and is still so in many other Caribbean islands including the Dutch colonies. As it's for a long time in areas of the world with a similar climate, like South Asia.I'd not worry too much about it as a tourist, because tourists already tend to take more precautions and have better protection than the average local:* Room with either AC or fan plus mozzie coil* Daytime skin protection with a cream containing a minimum level of DEETMainly for locals who lack this skin protection, for obvious economic reasons, the risk is slowly increasing and stricter government measures are needed.So as long as you take these protections (also if you're tanning, use a combi of sunscreen and Deet cream) not much need to worry I'd say.All the best,<Erik> & [Sandya] / twice a year at least in some dengue-infected area"
"I could be paranoid, but 33,000 cases this year out of a population of about 450,000 sounds pretty bad."
"It is, but it's totally similar to other basically urbanised areas with same climate. Like Dutch Antilles or, as mentioned, South Asia; the urbanised areas of our 2nd home country have upto 5-10% of the population infected too. Most of them the lighter variety of Dengue. But again, hardly any tourists amongst them...All the best again,<Erik> & [Sandya]"
