Has anyone had a refund yet from easy jet I have had a email to say they have cancelled the flight but only have offered a change of flight cannot call them as they are isolating anyone else got the same problem
"Probably thousands are waiting Stu ! They are playing a naughty game . Not letting you get through on the phone for a refund , technically you should be able to change your flight or apply for a refund on cancelled flights on ‘manage my bookings’ but they are making it so hard for everyone . All I would say if you have a cancelled flight and want a refund is to screen shot the flight tracker page that shows your flight as cancelled for extra proof. Other than that you can e mail them and then you have another form of proof that you applied ‘after’ the cancellation notice and not before . They then may say that you applied to cancel!!Edited: 12:52 pm, March 26, 2020 "
"I changed my April flights to a later date easily enough on Tuesday via manage my bookings.They are NOT offering refunds. Travel insurance may cover you for 'lost' money.Edited: 4:36 pm, March 26, 2020 "
"Not on their website Cubsur , supposed to ring up and claim but as you know and many are finding out you just can’t get through to customer services. There is also the chargeback scheme if booked with a credit card."
"Its disgraceful, Ryanair are as just as bad,many people having problems complaining about getting a refund. They are eager enough to take your money in the first place when you book but not eager enough to refund it. I am awaiting my cancellation for late end of April, heard nothing as yet and what problems it brings doing so. I emailed our hotel and they are closed and will stay closed until they get further details from the Portuguese government if its safe to open. That's another thing as we booked it separately and Travelrepubliic whom we booked it with are not giving much info at this moment in time, only that we may get a refund .mmmmmm"
"Just had a message today off easyJet that they have cancelled my flights with the option to change flights but when you go on to the page it comes up error and does not give you the option to change also there is no option To get a refund as they are saying it is exceptional circumstances what a jokeEdited: 2:11 am, March 27, 2020 "
"Stu , Obviously I don’t know what you are using to access easyJet site, I too have had this error coming up using the easyJet website on my I pad. If you are able to use their app I find it works better. Just as a note a friend has tried to get a refund for a flight easyJet have told him is cancelled, he’s pulling his hair out trying to do it on the site!! There is just no option to do this. When he phoned them up he just cannot get through. He is now contacting his credit card company to see what they can do ."
"We have several flights booked with easyjet in the coming months.We have also been offered the chance to change them. As we see it, we're happy to do this, things (God willing) will eventually return to normal, hopefully sooner rather than later. If they refunded everyone for these few months, then there would be no easyjet, similarly no Ryanair. Unless you are planning to never fly again, why not change? Support the thousands of staff, whose jobs depend on it. Stay safe everyone."
Good points and yes fully understand about keeping jobs etc I suppose some people just cannot change their dates. I will be changing my June dates if this continues. Not hopefull though.
"""Unless you are planning to never fly again, why not change ""? Maybe because in the last couple of weeks peoples financial positions have dramatically changed and they could probably do with the money , i know i could !"
#9 - Good point.
"Point taken but for those that can, please just change your dates. Not only that but when this is all over, I expect flights will be a lot more expensive for quite some time. We are leaving ours in place for as long as possible, I'm sure they'll have to release a further schedule at some point."
"I agree,, I’m sure there are so many people who have booked for summer months who would change to next year rather than have a refund so if they released some later dates it certainly would lessen the applications for a refund ."
We were due to fly out end of the month.. haven't heard anything from easyjet but obviously it's going to be cancelled.. we have a place out there so will change dates.. but I can't see anyone flying out anywhere this year until this is majorly under control- China was recovering but now they have imported cases!!
"We changed March flights to the Autumn, still have May and June to reschedule. We now have flights for Sep and October, also took the Jan/Feb offer. Anything we change here on out, will have to be for next year. Hopefully, they'll release more dates in the coming weeks. Not sure now, that this virus will completely disappear, I'm sure there will be second waves in most countries, as things return to normal. A vaccine may be the only option to eradicate it."
The Air Travel Forum has several threads on EasyJet cancellations - worth taking a look if you’ve not already done so. Hundreds if not thousands all in the same position.
"I don’t know what to do , we have a whole package holiday booked with Easyjet at the beginning of May , wondering if I change my flights will the same hotel also be transferred to my new flight date."
"We had a week in Albufeira at Tropical Sol booked from 30th June with Jet2. However we thought it very unlikely that our trip would be allowed to go ahead even though its three month away. So rather than wait for the surge of people wanting to re-book and the inevitable 2021 price increases, we only yesterday cancelled and re-booked exactly the same holiday apart from it being two days longer from 5th July -14th July 2021. The Guy we spoke to at Jet2 (after 30 mins trying to get an answer) was on the phone with us for a good 25 minutes and went through the process step by step to ensure everything was just as we wanted. He even gave us a "" Raincheck number"" to reduce our cost a little bit. Anyhow we ended up paying just an extra £240 and that included the admin fee and the extra two days in a 4star Hotel. So all in all very happy, and we are now counting down to what would have been out second visit on September 8th instead of counting down to June 30th, Hopefully it will be OK come school returning in early September.Edited: 9:40 am, March 27, 2020 "
"I'v had a couple of e_mails from Eayjet, advising me of my cancellation, and the process to rebook, or refund."
Today my easyJet Flight that has been cancelled is now offering me a voucher for a later date do I accept this or wait to see if I get a refund which I would rather have
Not sure if this is of any help to anyone ? https:/…
Unfortunately I don't think there is going to be any air travel anytime soon probably not till next year.
"I, and hundreds of others, was left stranded in Faro airport by Easyjet with absolutely no support or information. No ground staff to be found. They left some very old and vulnerable people stranded. It was fellow passengers who supported these people and sorted accommodation for them.Now that we're home we are finding it impossible to phone Easyjet to arrange a refund. They have made it impossible to get a refund via their website. Easyjet should be ashamed of how they've treated their customers. I have no interest in changing to another flight, I'll never fly Easyjet again."
Ruben. How did you get home?
You may not get the opportunity to fly anywhere for some time.Airlines are following government restrictions so normal refund procedures no longer apply.
"I hope you succeed Stu but don’t be surprised when you get another e mail saying they have given you a voucher code to use on your next booking , its just happened to a friend of mine. This voucher can be used on check out of booking a flight rather than having to ring call centre. I did send a link on a post I put up headed ...easyjet update . Take Care .Edited: 3:55 pm, March 29, 2020 "
How far ahead are they cancelling .. I’ve got June fights booked from Southend to Faro . Haven’t heard anything yet and there is no mention of a cancellation on the website.
Yes got another e-mail last night saying it is now a voucher lasts six months
Easy jet have now grounded all flights for the foreseeable future.
"Yes its all across the TV channels this morning!Gatwick North which easyJet “literally” owns/occupies announced last week it would be closing down this week, but Gatwick South remains open - BA use it but for the past week they have been parking a lot of their fleet down here at Bournemouth Airport as Gatwick is “full up” with Thomas Cook aircraft. Very soon there won’t be an aircraft in the skies and many airports will be closed completely!"
"I got home by using Aer Lingus, flight from Faro to Dublin, stayed overnight in Dublin airport and then flight to UK the following morning.The flight from Faro had only 35 people onboard and only 4 were going to Ireland. All others were going to all parts of the UK and there was also a couple from France trying to get home. Almost all on board were originally booked with Easyjet. If Aer Lingus can fly a plane with 35 passengers on board then ( most of whom had only booked at short notice ) then why did Easyjet abandon so many people?"
"I realise this is the easyJet thread but BA has this morning announced it is shutting down all its flights from Gatwick. As mentioned in my post #30 yesterday, BA have been moving their planes to Bournemouth Airport where they are now parked along the runway and every conceivable space. Over a billion pounds worth of aircraft just sitting there. Gatwick North now shut and Gatwick South which BA used getting quieter by the day.Edited: 3:02 am, March 31, 2020 "
"A voucher that only lasts six months is just not good enough. Who wants to go anywhere in the next six months even if flights are running which I highly doubt.I want to go on holiday in the spring not autumn or winter. The new social restrictions around the world are going to create a lot of problems. And the climate of fear of being close to people is going to make the experience of being on holiday a lot less enjoyable. People are going to be scared about sitting next to complete strangers on planes for a start. Are the airline companies going to reduce the number of passengers on flights? This situation is not going to go back to normal for months if ever.Edited: 3:16 am, March 31, 2020 "
"Site down at @ 16:30pm Stu . Maybe resolving issues?re post 33, Gary. When you say voucher is only for 6 months , that is to book a flight within that period. If we emerge from this within 6 months there should be a flight schedule available within the booking period to book for next spring or even summer."
"I have 7 flights booked for 27 April returning on 4 May.We have heard nothing yet and despite them grounding all planes for 2 months I am still able to check-in and print boarding cards at moment! Flights not shown as cancelled.Liverpoolman have got some sort of confirmation that you only need to book a flight within the 6 month period, not fly within 6 months? If not the voucher would be no use to us.Whilst appreciating the difficulties, I would not be keen to take a voucher. Easyjet flights only are not covered under the ATOL scheme. If you take a voucher would you be able to claim a refund on credit card if Easyjet goes bust? Too risky.Edited: 1:20 pm, April 01, 2020 "
"Hi , i think you have to wait until the official cancellation e mail from them. As for the voucherI have had credit shells from easyjet in the past and you can book a flight within the 6 month period so in effect it gives you the opportunity to book further than 6 months because in most cases the next schedule has come out so you can book ahead, I am ‘hoping ‘ the same conditions apply for these ‘ vouchers’ however it is to be proved so please don’t take it as done deal , here is some info from easyjet if you haven’t seen Ithttps:/…disruption-vouchersAs for claiming a refund after voucher given I cannot help with that. Hope the above is of some help to you."
"Abta now want the government to alter the rules .So I would not bank on getting a 100% refund from sny Abta, Atol member."
Liverpoolman we have been offered similar terms. I am assured that it will be ABTA covered. Just checking it out first. If you only have flights with Easyjet the only protection you have is Credit Card if they go bust.24! You are brave. I have been doing this for 15 years for 8 and that is enough trouble.
"We’ve been doing it since 1995 ! Gone from 8 to 24 over the years. Due to stay in Vilamoura. We will return !! We know the owner of the golf company and all should be ok. I think ABTA actually asked for an extension to 4 months for refunds not sure what it is now. Yes credit card could be a way if it folds, I think EASYJET will be ok , well I hope so , we use them all the time , so easy from Liverpool excuse the pun. Take Care"
"Easyjet have updated the rules for use of voucher. Main wording as follows :The voucher is valid for 12 months from the date of issue. You do not need to travel before the expiry date, you can book onto any flights that are on sale at the time you redeem your voucher. The voucher can only be used on easyJet.com using the same easyJet account as the original booking. Not available on the mobile app. The voucher code must be entered on the payment page prior to completion of the booking. Only one voucher can be used per booking"
Thanks for the info Damasust it will answer a lot of questions from people .
"Damassust, where did you get this info from, was it by personal email, on your easyjet account or is it on their website. I have friends who havn't can't even see the offer of a voucher on their easyjet account. Thanks for any info."
"Jayjan , the info below is off easyJet’s website, firstly you need the e mail from easyjet to say your flight is now cancelled. I think then you have the option to reschedule it or accept the voucher , for a refund they are making you ring up , and we know how hard that is ! So.....you get a code if you choose to take a voucher and when you do rebook there is supposed to be a section you put the voucher code into upon check out . https:/…disruption-vouchers"
EJ are now sending out emails cancelling all April flights.We have changed our flight to May but who knows if and when normal flight schedules will resume..
"Maybe a little comfort to everyone ... here is flight radar today over europe ... the big airports still have plenty of flights ... Lisboa, Madrid, Barcelona, Gatwick ... there are many hundreds of planes still in the air right now ..https://www.flightradar24.com/39.9,5.09/5"
"Pyrman I use flight radar all the time, amazing when you zoom out to world wide view where all the flights are grouped in large numbers! Germany, Holland and eastern USA and China !Edited: 8:29 am, April 04, 2020 "
Changed flight from April to May ? LOL LOL LOL
"Not really, we Don,t mind staying for the summer.We can always reschedule if nothing changes.We do not need bars, clubs, etc to enjoy our time in the Algarve.."
"That's very optimistic of you re~booking for May. We've booked for June ,I'll doubt that'll happen. I think this situation will only ease late autumn /early winter. If I get a voucher I'll rebook next May. Unfortunately, I booked hotel fee upfront, no cancellation fee but may get it back through credit card.People mat claim through credit card section 75 or use debit card Charge back scheme. Our travel firm went bust last summer, hotel booking was cancelled and cause I booked with debit card (try not to use debit card ) I reclaimed money through banks debit card Charge back scheme. It's a voluntary scheme so payment is at banks discretion unlike credit card section 75 were banks have a statutory duty to pay customers loses. Be safe everyone #StayatHome."
"I have booked to return to the UK , not the Algarve.. It's for business reasons.If we have to stay here for another 2 /3 months or even longer then that is ok with us."
I had holidays booked for May but obviously that's not going to happen. I cancelled my reservations but still my credit card info is all over the Algarve. To be safe I reported my credit card stolen and got a new card and number. So if anyone tries to sneak a charge through on my old number it's going to bounce.
"Had an email today cancelling our flight to Faro on 19th April, yet our return flight back to Bristol is not showing as cancelled. Anyone else had the same issue?"
Yes. They are cancelling in date order. I was due to fly to UK on 30th March and back to faro 3rd April. Got one email cancelling the 30th and a day or 2 later another to say 3rd was cancelled.
"Post 56 This info may also help , there is a section regarding return flightshttps://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-an…"
"Great, thank-you!"
"Easyjet currently offering Hold case addition for 99p!Edited: 4:35 am, April 12, 2020 "
Thanks .. just booked for September and next March ..
I will be using the next set of flights which I expect will be cancelled for later in the year..
"Saw this posted last night and utilised for five separate flights, less than a tenner, good shout!"
Great news Stu fingers crossed we get ours refunded we were taking family out for Easter which was 7 flights.
"Stu , just wondering did you eventually get the refund after a telephone call to them?"
yes Phoned Saturday after I found another site on Facebook easyJet complaints and got a phone number to call only took about 10 mins as when the recorded message came on I just hung up and phoned again until I got through
If it was Resolver that is just a third party site.Carefull there are companies offering to get you a refund just like the PFI companies..
What is a PFI company terry/Terrance?
B***** predictive text. PPI.Those scammers who offer to get your money back for a substantial fee.
No it was easyJet that I was talking to not a resolver company the full amount was debited back to my account they only ask for the booking reference I do believe there will be scammers out there ready to pounce so don’t give any bank details out the refund should be returned to the card you paid with when you booked and easyJet have that information
That's good news.We have been rescheduling our EJ flights.It's BA who are just offering credit notes.
"Thank you Stu. Good to know you got it ok. , I have a flight booked end of April but obviously have to wait until I get the official cancellation notice, I may however take the voucher as it gives me a year to book another trip. Not sure If I fancy waiting for hours to get through to Easyjet on the phone to be honest, Cheers."
"Should of been travelling tomorrow, offered change or vouchers by email, opted for vouchers then received another cancellation e mail for the return leg, offering change, vouchers or refund. Within the email it advised responding with the 'contact us' form for refund. I did that quoting the booking ref. I asked for a full refund explaining I had previously opted for vouchers. Didnt hold out much hope BUT today I checked my bank account and they have refunded the lot! Faith restored.. Good luck everyone"
"excellent MrsMunt. We are still awaiting our refund from Ryanair. Been approved but when it will hit back into our bank account is another thing. What a total fiasco, Eager enough to take your money when booking but not same when you want it refunded. I would have thought todays technology on their systems would suffice for that.Edited: 6:19 pm, April 17, 2020 "
"Yes ,easy enough to refund.That is why they sit on one billion cash reserves waiting to spend it on an airline in trouble after this pandemic finishes."
I did read an article a few days ago about easyJet hopefully will soon introduce a refund ‘ button’ on the manage my booking area on the website.
Well here is some new info......easyjet finally has got an online refund form ! Two days after I accepted a voucher!! ( which I haven’t really got a problem with as will be using it ) but for those who can’t maybe this article will help . https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/holidays…
Just submitted my claim form. Worryingly simple. Says they are trying to settle within 28 days' but not to contact them until after 90 days! At least I don't have to spend hours on the phone!
"They had to do something Damasust. Let’s hope all the refunds do not have too much affect on their business. I was happy to take a voucher for my flight due next Monday , it was a cheapish return for myself for a golf trip so will just use voucher next time. Come June when I have two more expensive flights booked I will probably go for the refund . Glad you got sorted."
As long as the link doesn’t direct you to a scam site to give out card/bank details.
My one is for 8 return flights. Will rebook for next year once refund received. Have reasons for taking cash even if rebooking.
"Post 82... no scam, the link takes you to easyjet refund form just need booking reference . If Anyone is concerned you can access the same page through easyJet’s own website . Just go on the help button and write in covid 19 , you then need to find in orange writing Covid-19 help hub click that and follow the pages by answering the questions until right at the bottom you see View ‘my other options ‘ next page at the bottom you will see ‘refund application form ‘ in orange . And that’s the form you need. Hope that helps some people."
"Thanks for the info Liverpoolman.Can you request a refund before you receive an email saying your flights have been cancelled, or do you need to wait?Reason I'm asking is that we pretty much know we wont be able to fly (late May/early June) and have already rearranged our accommodation for next year. Would be nice to have the cash to hand to open up other options, if and when they become available."
We looked at the refund option but as we can reschedule for nothing and the prices for new flights is higher than we paid a refund made no sense..
"In your case Terry probably the better choice . Sure everyone has a different situation. I prefer to re schedule myself or take the voucher but not for June , I will be asking for the refund. El n hills ..... you can only get the refund with the online form if your flight is within 7 days. If you click the option ‘ is your flight over 7 days away ‘ it just takes you back to the start. Hope that helps."
Ps ..l notice that easyjet is still offering the 99p charge for bags etc !! Could not resist booking two flights next March great price plus 99p for bags !! LOL.
Thanks Liverpoolman.I'll wait for the cancellation email then get our money back - gives us options to use Jet2 or even Ryanair if their flight times and/or prices are better next year.
Expect to wait at least 28 days though for refund. That is the time scale they are saying .
Interesting article this morning ......https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-an…
"Usual UK Government garbage ... no-one knows what `indefinite` means .. and it remains `advice `.. After 20,000 deaths ... many of which might have been saved by better government .. they may just be covering their backs for the next few `peak`weeks ... Ryanair is still flying this week from Stansted to Lisboa and other countries .. Easyjet have prices up to Faro from May 17 .. If you speak double-dutch you will know more .."
Easy jet cancelled our May flight this week.Ignore anything you see on any airline sites.The UK government has not lifted its travel ban and neither have the Portuguese.

Well said #94
"Just to be clear, care homes charge an average of around £1,000 per week, not per month."
I had 12 flights booked two with Jet 2 six with Easy jet and the rest with Ryan air.The first flights were with Ryan air the second with Jet 2. and the last with Easy jet All three airlines have emailed me to confirm cancellations. I chose not to reply as it would be covered by EU 261 or my insurance or by section 75 via VisaRyan air keep sending me emails promising payment in due course up to one yearJet 2 on the other hand refunded my visa account in full on Wednesday 29/04/2020 to cover cancellation of flight LS 876 due to fly 25/04/2020My next flight is Easy jet on 09/05/2020 perhaps they will refund me 4 days later
"Can't fault easyjet, I've transferred all flights to future dates, no charge and they've just extended my Flight Club membership for 12 months. I've two other flights pending, June and August which we can tranfer to any other easyjet flight. Just waiting to see if they release further dates."
We have moved two flights to Sept and November at no cost.
"#98 I too have had my flight club extended again. ( A handy thing to have) Maybe cos I transferred a few flights and took a voucher on another. #97 slightly confused... you say you did not contact any of the airlines yet Jet 2 refunded you after 4 days of your original flight date without any contact from you? If so, that is very good service ."
"Liverpoolman, did you get your FC email yesterday?Friends of mine who took refunds for all flights, haven't yet had the email...........just curious!"
"Yes , it came through yesterday. I too wondered if it’s because I did not ask for a refund and took a voucher. Mind you the first voucher request I did was before the refund form was available . Certainly was not going to be put on hold for hours with a phone call. I was happy to get the voucher for a flight for myself and then move other flights when both of us fly. I also booked some new flights In March at very low prices along with the 99p bag cost! Might have also helped ?"
"Very similar, I amended my first flight early in March before anything really kicked off. But I went through on the FC phone number and only waited about 5/10 mins. The others, I've just done via 'Manage Bookings' and was refunded the few quid difference, which I wasn't expecting. Also booked on the special offer for next Feb/March. Just hoping they release dates beyond next April before my June flight is due, otherwise I'll take the voucher."
"I read on another e mail I got from easyjet that they are going to release the next summer 21 Schedule earlier than usual. Let’s face it , they want the bookings ! I’m in the same boat, have two flights booked 1st June, ( they weren’t cheap either) I doubt they will go ahead but would change if the next flight schedule are released.I actually should have been there now golfing !!! ☹️Edited: 6:27 pm, May 02, 2020 "
"Yes I added the 99p bag to all five trips, haven't taken a hold bag in ages.........In fact, if it hadn't been for a trip to Oz, last year, I'd have to have bought one, just for the deal. lol"
"Is there a link to these dates, is it likely to be in August ?"
"Gerry, which dates? Not quite sure who your post is aimed at....."
"Gerry, I think you are asking about a ‘link’ to the next schedule release ? If so there isn’t one. The next schedule release would I imagine include August flight availability if that’s what you need."
"I'm due to checkin today, Although it seems unlikely that we will be able to fly early June, should I still do so to get a refund?"
"Check in may open today (30 days before) but it's not necessary to check in, (in normal times) until much nearer the time. easyjet are working on a 7 day rolling, so will contact you then. Or you can go to their website and claim. https://www.easyjet.com/en/refund-formUnfortunately, it doesn't look like any of us will be flying, any time soon. Stay safe.Edited: 4:44 am, May 05, 2020 "
My flight for the 27th April was cancelled on the 14th so they cancelled 13 days ahead. I had not checked in. .... Maybe now they are only cancelling 7 days ahead.
"Stand corrected, although I think it may be the other way round. In the early days they were working on 7 days rolling, things have obviously improved over time. Should just add, (in normal times) it is a good idea to check in asap, if you haven't prebooked specific seats. More likely to be allocated seats together. However, until you've checked in, some changes can still be made, without incurring extra charges. Which is why, I generally leave it until nearer the time.Edited: 5:48 am, May 05, 2020 "
Following on from your your post algarveaddict I’m am wondering now if it is best to check in asap . If they are to reduce seating as suggested I wonder who the unfortunate ones will be when it comes to filling the plane . I always book a seat anyway but who knows how they may control this in the future. ‘First up best dressed ‘ perhaps?
"I always prebook too, though sometimes make changes, in the few days before. Talk now of pre flight tests, for several countries. This may be the only way, until a vaccine is found and widely used. Whatever happens.......I'm not going to stress. Glass half full, we'll get there, eventually."
New info on flight release.....they have just released extra dates up to 4th May 2021
The CEO of Easy jet Portugal has said that flights are unlikely to start until June and then only if The UK reopens to travel.Portugal Resident .
My 2nd of June seems unlikely then!
"""My 2nd of June seems unlikely then!""Very. And even if people can fly here, there may not be much when they arrive.I have just read that churches will be allowed to re-open but possibly no bars and night clubs.Edited: 4:41 am, May 07, 2020 "
"Even if you could get over to the Algarve from what I am reading they may be looking at a 14 day quarantine when you return to the UK? It’s certainly a free for all at the moment , I know someone who has just returned from the USA , no checks either end !! ( and had to return via two countries) beggars belief at how inconsistent the rules are ."
"Indeed, there are plenty of examples I see every day of 'rules' being ignored although there was a security guard at the supermarket here yesterday making sure everyone had masks on before entering.You may, I read, have to be given a medical check before you can enter an airport. That will make air travel even more disgreeable than it is at the moment.Will the 'new normal' be meekly accepted, even in the knowledge that it may mean no summer holidays to the Algarve because of quarantines, no cinema, no theatre, no concerts, no spectator or amateur team sports, no pubs, no work for many.....Even if activities are permitted, airlines and tour operators will have to raise prices to make any money if they have to fly planes only half full, likewise all other forms of transport and probably a lot else besides.Edited: 6:21 am, May 07, 2020 "
Or .... airports to `cash in` on coronavirus .. ? Maybe airlines too ...https://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2020/0…
If airlines and tour operators start raising prices too much they will still be flying planes only half full.
"#122If we have to factor in an airport test at €190 per person,what is that going to do to air travel going forward?"
"An airport test at €190 per person???Well, offhand, that would just about kill the tourism industry."
"#124 - If that's what is required for people to go on holiday, I'm sure there will be plenty prepared to pay for it."
"Our last regular three night jaunt over to Alvor in February/March this year cost us £160 per person - that was for flights, accommodation and transfers.There's no way we would have organised it and went if we would have had to have paid an extra €190 each on top of that - the whole idea is for it to be cheap and cheerful.It will destroy the tourist industry if families have to factor in an additional £720-odd for an average family of four - for a lot of people going for a week that will nigh on double the cost of the holiday."
Who in the UK or Portugal is even suggesting it.Austria has been one of the strictest when it comes to closing its borders during the crisis.
My apologies Terry R - I admit I didn't click on the link and read it before adding my two penn'orth. I assumed because this was thread on an Albufeira forum that the link referred to Faro or Lisbon.I forgot the old adage about assuming something before checking.Slap on the wrist for me :)
"I had to extend our car rental today.The manger who we have got to know well, plus every other Portuguese person we have spoken to in the last 6 weeks has congratulated us on making the right decision to stay.They view the UK as being a dangerous place to be living in."
"Ryanair ... currently only flying to Lisboa ... will restart Stansted to Porto, May 22 ..."
"When will they start fkying to popular tourist destinations, June or July..O,Reily said unlikely before July.I cannot see many Brits driving to Stanstead and then driving down from Porto to the Algarve..It's the Faro flights that 99% of people are interested in."
Who is O'Reilly.
Someone ought to tell O'Malley! :-))
Or even Mother O'riley
Or Father Christmas.
Wasnt O ‘Reilly the builder in Faulty Towers?

"Well I’ve heard it all now .... the horse has definitely bolted and no chance of catching it , ...looking like the government is bringing in 14 day quarantine for people returning to the UK borders. Likes of Australia brought it in within days of the announcement of Covid19 . March 23rd was when our version of lockdown started , where are we now ? enough said!!!"
The Irony of it is that the UK remains one of the most infectious countries in Europe.Anyone returning from Portugal is more likely to become infected in the UK..
Portugal did this in Algarve 2 months ago. Too late now!
Boris The Buffoon is also going to announce that those under 12 week lockdown will see their lockdown extended until 30th June at the earliest. So I can`t see there being any holiday flights before then (you can`t lock some up whilst allowing others to fly for leisure) so Jet2 & 17th June looks certain to be a no-go. How do I know about the lockdown extension ? received a text yesterday from NHS . As for the suggested 14 day quarantine !!! TOO LATE !!!
"I have just had an e-mail from Easyjet saying my June 2nd flight has not been cancelled yet, but if I want I can change my dates to anytime or anywhere for no extra cost. Or I can have a voucher, and they will give me £10 towards further holidays. In the t&c's it then says that if I do change, then there will be no refund if flight is cancelled.I presume if my June flight is cancelled, then I will also be able to get a refund?"
"We have flights booked for May 28th, returning on June 4th.We've heard nothing yet regarding cancellation.Beginning to get a little worried now."
"I moved my May flights, I doubt that they will operate.The Algarve will still be under some degree of restrictions."
"Unfortunately, moving our flights isn't an option as we have re-booked our accommodation for mid-June next year and there are no Easyjet flights on sale for that time.We need the money back so that we can weigh up our options regarding who we fly with nearer the time.Edited: 7:26 am, May 12, 2020 "
"UK is only marginally more `infectious`than Portugal ... and if you took the very low rates of Algarve and Alentejo out ... would be more or less the same. Actually it would be far better to allow people north of Birmingham to fly to the Algarve ... and keep Northern Poruguese out .. You would also be much less at risk flying from Algarve to northern Britain .. or even the London airports... because Faro is now equipped with temperature cameras, etc ..I would not be confident of any local risk level if travel is allowed into Algarve from the north or Spain, with other than air travel. Algarve risk is currently around 1 in 7000 ... in Lisboa and Porto more like 1 in 200 ..Easyjet is currently 7 weeks behind with refunds. I was due to fly March 23 .. getting refunded this week ..Edited: 8:57 am, May 12, 2020 "
Uk Health Secretary Matt Hancock ( although many have another name for him) announced today -“We will seek to reopen hospitality from early July if we keep successfully reducing the spread of this virus but I think social distancing of some kind is going to continue. And the conclusion from that is that it’s unlikely big lavish international holidays are going to be possible for this summer. I just think that’s a reality of life.”For once I agree with him.
"Post 152.Comparw deaths per million. There is no comparison between the UK and Portugal Just over 1100 deaths Portugal 32000 UK.If the UK had the same death rate as Portugal in the UK it would be around 7000.After London the most infectious places in the UK are in the North. Its nonsense to suggest that UK tourism is safer for the Algarve than Northern Portuguese.Edited: 10:10 am, May 12, 2020 "
"#148#149.... I too have flights on the 1st June , just waiting for the cancellation e mail than I can decide/act accordingly. (Don’t like the sound of the t&c’s on no refund if your changed flight is cancelled as you can only move upto May 4th 2021 at the moment. ) the e mail will be along soon. I was informed 13 days ahead for a cancellation 27th April. Decided to take the voucher cos no refund option online at the time and waiting time on the phone was horrendous , Still waiting for my voucher! Personally I would just hang on a bit for the e mail then you have more options."
"Just to add to my post a couple of days ago, the offerwas only available until the 19th may."
"From reply 153 ""...it’s unlikely big lavish international holidays are going to be possible for this summer.""So may I assume that it's Ok for us who aren't doing big and lavish? Eg Easyjet customers still struggling for refunds.And no mention of the still planned 14 days quarantine on arrival for anyone daring to fly from Portugal to the UK, maybe from the end of this month.I have Easyjet flights to and from UK booked for late July. I await my fate."
"#154 % of population would be a better comparison. And since you're making the comparison is it like for like? Scottish covid death stats include cases where covid 19 is not the primary cause of death but is mentioned on the death cert, for example, Portugal may not. British covid stats include all deaths whether in hospital or in the community and whether or not the person had been tested. Many other countries do not. Therefore you may have an ""apples and pears"" comparison. I have not looked into all these queastions. As you are making the comparison it's up to you to ""fact check"". The situation may be as black and white as you claim but you have not done the work to justify that claim.Edited: 6:44 am, May 13, 2020 "
"I think it's clear to everyone now that normal society will not return for a few months yet. Of course, we are seeing small easing of restrictions in construction and manufacturing. I'd rather not go on holiday with social distancing still in effect. I can cope with that at home but on holiday I want to be totally relaxed and that means going to restaurants, bars and cafes just like normal times. We holiday in AdP and in the main older couple /group on holiday who are higher risk of CV19 . That group will delay a holiday for this year or they pay extortionate travel insurance. Some people will be ok mixing with others but totally relaxed holiday. I doubt it.i think we'll see a big surge of holiday travel next year so demand will push up prices. Maybe good if people go this year as it will soften travel for next holiday season. What does everyone think? Surely social distancing in public places will spoil holiday relaxation ?"
Agree with you Gerry. It's not going to be the same atmosphere at all. I will report back next week when I ventured to a restaurant to say how it feels. I appreciate everyone is different and will feel different vibes but it's not going to be anywhere near 'normal' or as you say relaxing. I've noticed people are still afraid to be anywhere near their friends and work colleagues.
"Nicky, it’s been blasted into our minds day in day out for weeks , no wonder people are frightened to be near anyone . Even after the restrictions where lessened from today we still only went out for a short walk local. It is going to feel very strange driving some distance . ...I think brainwashed is the word I am actually looking for !"
"161 Liverpool you are right of course.Here in Carvoeiro we have narrow pavements with the tables of some bars and restaurants almost on them.It will be impossible for them to open and maintain a safe distance between customers and the general public.We have music in the square during the summer , the resorts focal point,that cannot happen if social distancing is to be maintained. .Regulations on beaches.Every resort in the Algarve has the same issues, it is going to be a very different place in 2020 for those who come on holidayEdited: 3:28 am, May 14, 2020 "
Will the wheels still be on the car liverpoolman or will it be up on bricks?
#165 the old jokes are the best eh William.
"Well done William, you win the crusty old stereotype of the week award. Good work."
Don’t bite Cal21
Unfortunately due to restrictions I am unable to get to Liverpool to claim this award.How many fingers does it have?
I checked this morning and it looks like EJ have cancelled the majority of their UK Faro flights for May and June.Ist flights 1st July.Their return from Faro prices are the cheapest we have ever seen £16 for a high season flight..
"Interesting Terry , I wonder when they will inform people who have June flights booked. ?"
Just been notified that our outbound flights on 28/05 have been cancelled - no mention yet of the return flights on 04/06.
"173,, Erin check the website, you may see no flights available for June..If there are none going out there obviously can be none coming back.Edited: 9:38 am, May 15, 2020 "
Erin .... this may help you with your question. https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-an…
Just for info. The CEO of carvoeiro club rentals sent a message to all owners today giving an update on current situation. In that message she stated.....there is currently no date as to when Faro Airport will reopen. Make of that what you will. I'm not starting another row! Have a good weekend all.
"Thanks Nikky , Hope the weather picks up for you this weekend. . TBH Everything is up in the air and so many conflicting information going around. I certainly can’t see any air travel soon to the Algarve. . Stay Safe ."
"We were told the same "", No opening Date "" by an employee of the Nau group of hotels.Until they know when flights in volume will return they will not have enough guests to make it worthwhile opening."
"Quite right Terry. It's very much a 'chicken and egg' situation. Many resorts won't open until the airlines fly, and the airlines probably won't fly if the resorts are not open. Who gives first?All the airlines have their flights in the system, but with UK and other governments changing their minds every 5 minutes who can blame airlines and tour operators for not selling any more seats. I think I read that Spain is to impose a 14 day quarantine on all arrivals. If correct, that's their tourist industry done for. There is presently no suggestion that Portugal is going to do similar, but who knows?Here's one view of the latest piece of genius, something else to put people off coming. https:/…I shall be having a prowl around Albufeira at the weekend to see if I can tell which restaurants might be opening as of Monday, from when this is allowed.Edited: 1:43 pm, May 15, 2020 "
"We played here on weds, made it to the 14th before being washed off the course.Hoping tomorrow's forecast is wrong.."
Thanks for the replies everyone.I'll be contacting Easyjet ASAP to sort out a refund.
"Apparently Easyjet have been hacked. over 9million customers details, along with some credit cards."
"Just coming on BBC news 1pm Easyjet cyberattack, 9 million customers affected. Also in the Sun online.https:/…"
"#186 #187 No doubt the hackers thought it an Easyscam but everyone will be advised to change account password or card details. No doubt info will be sold on the dark web for identify fraud, loans, cash withdrawals. Be alert!?"
"The data breach was in fact in January and the 2,200 (approx) affected card holders were all contacted. Why its taken until now to disclose this isn’t clear."
Yes I saw that too about data breach being in January. Makes you wonder whether they kept it quiet from the media until now then it wouldn't scare other potential customers to book flights.
"Quick heads up for anyone wondering how many days ahead flights are cancelled by EASYJET. , I’ve just had mine cancelled today for the 1st June. So in my case 13 days ahead."
My June 2nd has also been cancelled today.
July 1st still looking like the date they will resume flights .
"Looks like it Terry, I just hope airlines are not taking peoples money knowing they won’t be flying from that date. Plenty of planes over sunny Liverpool today !!"
"That's how the airlines are maintaining a positive cash flow. They're taking people's money for bookings they know won't likely take place and exchanging it for travel vouchers. In essence they're getting loans at zero percent interest from passengers to keep their business afloat. From a business perspective, it's a pretty clever move."
I checked two of their busiest airports and you cannot book a June flight..So the flights at risk if you book are July onwards.)
"This is some good news that Easyjet will resume some flights on 15 June https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-easyj…Edited: 3:43 am, May 21, 2020 "
Within the UK and to France were mentioned on BBC news.But its a start.
Domestic flights only from what I've heard.
And France I believe
"We have easyjet flights booked for June, I am not convinced that they will actually happen. In the unlikely event that they are flying, I'll probably still reschedule for possibly August and break our 'Never in silly season' rule. I'm guessing that it will still be pretty quiet. A shout out to all those that are still sticking to the lockdown rules, wherever you are, plenty of Covidiots in the UK making this last longer than is necessary."
Easyjet Only starting with short duration flights which with masks being mandatory for all on board...
"Easy Jet can say what they want , The fact is they will not be flying until our Government and the destinations Government grant them permission. And with our dithering part-time PM ""in charge"" (LOL) it may be quite a while before the UK has done enough for its citizens to be allowed into low risk countries"
Has Ireland removed its advice on unnecessary overseas travel?.
"UK briefings are being given by a variety of people. I'd prefer to know that one person, presumably Boris Johnson, is in charge. Is this an attempt to spread the blame? The cabinet are fighting like cats in a sack over their different views. Aren't they supposed to argue their cases in cabinet and then stick to the joint decision? Too much politics and too little medicine/science.Edited: 6:46 am, May 21, 2020 "
"#204No-Even though airlines are making announcements,Ryanair has plans to restore 139 routes from Ireland from July 1st,all plans are subject to Governments lifting travel bans within the EU,and public health measures being put in place in airports."
I applied for a refund last week.Anyone know how long it takes and if they email you to tell you it has been repaid?I need to know as the refund will go back to a card I no longer have as the account has been closed. I'll have to contact the card provider to have it traced and sent to my current account.Thanks in advance.
Still waiting nearly 4 weeks not had any updates.On the other hand Jet2 were brilliant refund in the bank after 3 days
Received automated email but still no refund as yet this was for 3rd of April.
"I stumbled across this Easyjet article and has comprehensive information on easyjet plans from 15 June. It includes UK domestic flights and European flights. I hope people find it useful, nothing particularly new but covers multiple threads on here in one place.https:/…"
"As the advice is not to travel to Portugal, will Easyjet have to give a refund? Our flights are still showing as going but our travel insurance would be void if we were to travel."
"Easyjet will refund if your flights are cancelled by them, you have other options......https:/…q0Edited: 6:17 am, July 08, 2020 "
My flight was cancelled for 8th June got refund yesterday. Yes also got email to confirm. Hope this helps.
"Got two separate emails dated 03/07 concerning refunds issued - both for the same flights, just booked on different days with different references. Emails came seconds apart. One of the refunds was received by my credit card company on 07/07 and I now have that money back in my savings. The other refund hasn't turned up yet. Rang Easyjet and was told they can take up to five working days to arrive. When I asked why one had arrived and the other hadn't, despite them being refunded on the same day, seconds apart ,they had no amnwer to give other than wait and see."
