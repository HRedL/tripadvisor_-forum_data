"Parks, beaches, churches are swamped with people in the US, even during stay at home orders. I am afraid that once people think we are on the upward side of the curve, they'll all act like prisoners released from jail.Watch for secondary spikes."

"Most parts of China were okay with very few cases throughout the pandemic. Huangshan crowd is all over the news. My guess they’ll be okay, people need to go out for the mental health. But the huge crowd looks miserable.Likewise most parts of the US are relatively okay with limited cases, I have been getting many messages from suppliers in China daily expressing concern and worry for my safety, because the US looks very bad in the news. New York is very bad like Wuhan, due to bad management by local officials, but most parts of US are doing okay. News doesn’t reflect the reality. We are just having an extended vacation at home in the sunny beautiful California.US beaches and parks are not jam packed with people, they are closed and empty. There were some people on first weekend during shutdown at few locations, but no more for couple weeks since then."
