This article talks about the massive drop of business for some restaurants in Chinatown. There are no known cases of coronavirus in NYC. I'm going to head to Flushing.https://ny.eater.com/2020/2/7/21123274/coron…
"Well, there are currently two persons in Flushing hospitals that are being tested for coronavirus. My neighbors are constantly running off to China and Flushing would be a prime location for an outbreak should it come. To make matters worse, the 7 train passes through Corona Plaza."
"There's a reason for the low ""demand"". Risk factor."
"If by “risk factor” you mean “racism,” I agree with you."
I heard that. Crazy!
"Last time I checked the official information from NYC is that there are NO cases of corona virus in New York. All tests for the virus have come back negative and there is only one test result pending. Hardly a reason to alarm people. By the way the last time I checked Flushing doesn't have some invisible barrier around it and people travel from there all over the city, so maybe you need to avoid NYC if you are soo concerned about outbreaks?"
The invisible barriers in Flushing such as Union Street divide the Chinese from the Koreans. The two groups seem to avoid each other and do not patronize stores of the other ethnicity.
"""The invisible barriers in Flushing such as Union Street divide the Chinese from the Koreans."" I guess the chinese people haven't figured out how to use the subway yet! By the way I know many people from China who do NOT live in Chinatown and instead live in other parts of NYC."
facetiousness alert.
"unbelievable, what some people think.....racism and paranoia, pure and simplePoppa"
There is even an article about what I have observed in Flushing on Wikipedia:https:/…Anti-Korean_sentiment_in_China
"Last week I had an opthamologist appt at a Boston hospital. Upon check-in, for the first time ever, they asked me questions: 1) do you have a cough or fever (no)2) have you been to Wuhan China in the past 4 weeks (no)3) Have you been in contact with somebody who has been to Wuhan China in the last 4 weeks (no?)But really, how could I answer question 3? I ride crowded subway trains daily, I shop in crowded stores where a variety of languages can be heard among the customers. For now, I will take normal hand washing precautions and live my life knowing I have a better chance of contracting the flu than the Novel Corona virus.Edited: 7:33 pm, February 08, 2020 "
Thanks for posting Red. I have heard sad similar stories. I am gonna head to Chinatown as well.
"I am weighting back in as something I said has sparked: words like racism and paranoia, etc.Paranoia? Well people are worried as this illness has so many unknowns and seems to be spreading fast. 5 people in the French Alps. Boatloads of cruise ships having their passengers in quarantine. It is serious and worrisome. Maybe NYCers don't seem to notice it, but here in Western Canada we do. It's always wise to be prudent and cautious.Racism? Can a group of people be racists on themselves? The Chinese restaurants I know are patronized mostly by Chinese. Are those who are staying away racists. There are major malls in Vancouver suburbs that are empty, their clientele is strictly Asian, mostly Chinese.FWIW: I may be Chinese, so am I a racist for bringing this up?"
Went to Flushing tonight. The parking garage was not even half full which is amazing for a Saturday night. The restaurant we went to was almost empty except for a few tables of chinese people. Spoke with the owner who owns a restaurant in flushing and another one in Manhattan's chinatown. She said business is down 80% as a result of what is going on.
"I don't think it's racism. After all, the local Chinese people aren't going either.I think it's more of being prudent, being afraid of the unknown, wanting to stay safe, not wanting to take a risk etc."
"I have noted more mask wearing than usual in Flushing and in my building. I recall the Fukushima nuclear incident in Japan when people in Flushing bought out all the iodized salt. While iodine is protective of the thyroid, the amount of salt you would have to consume to get a decent level would kill you. The NYT reported a run on toilet paper in Hong Kong. I am keeping more food than usual in my freezer just in case of some emergency, but do not wear a mask which can not be purchased here at this point in any event. There are reasonable precautions and panic and fear.Edited: 8:08 am, February 09, 2020 "
"Yup, there are reasonable precautions, and then there’s avoiding restaurants run by people of the same ethnicity as a virus on the other side of the world. I’ll be eating Chinese food this week."
"Here are your irregularly scheduled reminders:-The flu is far more fatal than Coronavirus. -The flu is in full swing in the US. -If you’re not stockpiling frozen food or avoiding going out because of the flu, then you’re being silly if you’re stockpiling it because of Coronavirus. -Masks do nothing to prevent you GETTING the virus, they only keep you from spreading it if you already have it. -Hand washing is always a good idea to keep from getting the flu."
"Well, I saw Dr. Fauci, head of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), on TV and he mentioned the mortality of coronavirus was indeed higher than the normal seasonal flu, roughly about 2% vs. 0.02%. However, this is not as high as the earlier SARS epidemic.I tend to increase my frozen food storage in the winter in case of cold weather or a snow storm and use it up as summer approaches. When I was working in a medical center, we were told at the annual safety lecture for all staff that when transporting persons with TB, only the patient and not the staff need wear masks."
"I don’t imagine that racists need much of an excuse. They just avoid, period. This is plain paranoia, especially coming from the media. Is it different in other parts of the world. Sidney?"
"Got back a short while ago from dim sum at our favorite place in Sunset Park Chinatown. While it wasn’t deserted, business was obviously down. We were seated immediately (that’s NEVER happened before); even when we left, around noon (when there would normally be a crowd packed into the entryway and spilling out the door, with the host/MC calling numbers nonstop), people were being directed straight to tables. No wait.The food was as good as ever. As the OP said, this is a great time to visit the city’s multiple Chinatowns. (Thanks, Red, for posting.)"
"***I don't think it's racism. After all, the local Chinese people aren't going either.I think it's more of being prudent, being afraid of the unknown, wanting to stay safe, not wanting to take a risk etc.***Fully agree, a personal decision to not eat Chinese food racist, really?"
"Well, is a personal decision to get out of an elevator when a Chinese person gets on racist? Because that sort of thing *is* happening.That said, I do agree that the fall-off in business for many restaurants is more of an intra-community thing than a xenophobic thing. The usual clientele of Bamboo Garden, the place I went this morning, is probably 90% (or more) Chinese. Manhattan Chinatown may be a different story, as they rely more heavily on tourists."
"In the large Chinese grocery store i go to, about half of the (primarily) Chinese patrons are wearing masks.Perhaps people are understandably afraid, and cautious, and unpersuaded by the approach and assurances of the Chinese government, with the sick and dead estimated to be 50,000 and 1,000 respectively by next Sunday, and not racist. The anguish of the people on the cruise ships is not racist against the Chinese. it's about the virus.Edited: 1:44 pm, February 09, 2020 "

"I think the scale of the measures taken by the originating country and concerns about the credibility of publicly released information have led to a variety of responses - some rational, some notThe city where this was first detected has a population close to that of the 5 boroughs of NYC.Imagine if NYC and multiple nearby cities were on a lockdown similar to what is going on there."
No it's happening here in Melbourne.
"Currently, Four in the ""Vancouver Coastal Health Region"". One of which was the first ""transmitted outside China""."
I went to the grocery store in Flushing after dinner. Saw a number of people. Didn't see a single person wearing a mask nor did I see that on the street or in restaurant.
"""Fully agree, a personal decision to not eat Chinese food racist, really?"" - umm if someone is refusing to eat chinese food in a city with no cases of the virus that is pretty much the definition of racist. Next thing you know people will refuse to walk into an italian restaurant if there are chinese people sitting at one of the tables."
"There are people who just don't like to eat Chinese food, it's a matter of their ""palate"" nothing to do with racism. It doesn't agree with their system, they are allergic to nuts etc. Racism term is being overused/abused in this issue of eating. Do people have to prove that they are not racist by going to a Chinese restaurant?I do not like Mexican food (don't like the combination of spices they use),but I love Northern Spanish cuisine is that racist? It's a matter of taste.I avoid anyone who is sneezing and or coughing without taking the necessary precautions."
"#31, the comments weren’t about people who simply don’t like the cuisine and never go to Chinatown anyway. They were about people who normally would, but are staying away because of misplaced hysteria. Actively avoiding a particular ethnic group out of fear is pretty much the definition of xenophobia."
I find it strange that I have not found any recent mention of the suspected cases in Flushing who have been hospitalized. I would think the tests would have been completed by now.
Folks did turn out for the parade....https:/…
"""I find it strange that I have not found any recent mention of the suspected cases in Flushing who have been hospitalized. "" The CDC makes them send the samples in for testing which delays getting the results back. That being said it is not cases plural. One of the two people's test came back negative so there is only one pending test for all of New York City and from what I recall in the two cases one of the people wasn't even hospitalized because their condition was very mild.Edited: 4:54 pm, February 09, 2020 "
Actually the two Flushing cases are both negative. The results they are waiting on is somewhere else in the city.https://flushingpost.com/test-results-come-b…
"“umm if someone is refusing to eat chinese food in a city with no cases of the virus that is pretty much the definition of racist” Umm thats a strange definitionIt’s like saying people who are afraid to fly and not afraid to drive are idiots. Fear is fear. It’s not rational, and it has nothing to do with racism. In time things will get back to normal. But if we learned anything from this thread is that tourists, locals, and many many Chinese are avoiding Chinese restaurants right now."
"So if a person who regularly eats Chinese food suddenly takes pause due to a concern, then that person suddenly becomes racist?"
"Great comments by Ziggy and ISDW, fully agree. ***Actively avoiding a particular ethnic group out of fear is pretty much the definition of xenophobia.******So if a person who regularly eats Chinese food suddenly takes pause due to a concern, then that person suddenly becomes racist?***And now xenophobic according to Linda. People have rights, if someone chooses to avoid anything, it's their choice."
"So how would you define xenophobia, Springerandy?Xeno = strange, foreign, “other”Phobia = fearIf you know a different definition, I’d love to hear it. (Seeing as how you singled me out in your post, I think I’m entitled to ask you for your own definition.)"
"""People have rights, if someone chooses to avoid anything, it's their choice."" Absolutely , but when they do so based on the prejudice towards a specific ethnic group it is also racist. By the way fear is not an excuse. Most racism throughout history was based on fear. Also,nobody is talking about people who simply don't like chinese food. The comments are directly in response to people avoiding areas/businesses run by chinese people solely because of some belief they are more likely to catch the virus there even though there are no confirmed cases in the city.Edited: 6:04 pm, February 09, 2020 "
"***Actively avoiding a particular ethnic group out of fear is pretty much the definition of xenophobia.***It's not about the definition, it's about how you have applied it here. By reading the comments from red and yourself, someone avoiding Chinese food during this time would be a racist and xenophobe. Come on, really, it's called a personal choice, plain and simple. Don't look further into things and try to label someone."
"My local Chinese seems to have the same amount of clientele. But I’ve read in the media that other areas such as our Chinatown have less clientele. However, my local Chinese is not in the city and It’s much smaller than the city area Chinatown. I haven’t got first hand info from the main Chinatown. Anyway, we are talking about avoiding a virus, not avoiding eating Chinese food because of a dislike of the food."
"Thank you, Ziggy and ISW. I speak from the perspective of Asians/Chinese, we are just avoiding eating and frequenting our ""usual"" haunts, until this issue somewhat settles. Am also referring to a larger sphere outside the general NYC area, where the cause for concern is present. It's about being cautious. Do I miss my weekend Dim Sum. Of course. But am holding off for a while, besides, no one wants to join me.TTFN. Am off for a long solitary walk."
"Springerandy: sigh. Please re-read my posts. If someone chooses to shun people and establishments because their real or perceived national origin frightens them, then, sure, that’s a choice. It’s also xenophobia, because that’s what xenophobia means. I’m not interested in name-calling, and in my own posts I stated my opinion (because I don’t have hard data) that much of the fall-off in business in Chinatown establishments is intra-community rather than the result of xenophobia. Not sure what about any of the above is so hard to understand or upsetting to you."
"Sadly, this whole discussion reminds me of the time back in the early 1980’s when folks were avoiding my own West Village neighborhood in the early panic days of the AIDS epidemic. People were afraid to come to restaurants or shops or hair salons for fear of “catching” AIDS (which back in the early days was just called “gay cancer” or more officially GRIDS)....Wonder how many of these people who are avoiding Chinese restaurants these days have bothered to get a flu shot.(But this has become a busy topic on the Paris Forum as well, where people from the US are posting thoughts of canceling trips to France. And some other cities have cancelled Lunar New Year festivities, but not NYC.)Edited: 7:41 pm, February 09, 2020 "

Nothing upsetting on my end. I just disagree with you, that's all. People have the right to do as they please, label them as you wish, but it's wrong."
"I very clearly remember being in a Midwestern Howard Johnson's in the mid 1960's when a family very conspicuously and loudly made the ""personal choice"" to abandon their table and leave when an African-American family entered and was seated.Some personal choices are benign (even if made from fear) others not so much"
"I ❤️ NYC.....NYC Lunar New Year Parade Showcases Support for China, Wuhan https:/…"
"It’s a matter of degree. Some are just scared of the unknown and avoid at all costs. While to some, it’s just a matter of “should we do Indian or Chinese tonight. Let’s do Indian and have Chinese nest week”. It’s a city of choices. And there are plenty in the latter group to make an impact."
Very well said Ziggy.
"I do agree with Ziggy, and also think that perhaps some folks may just want to avoid crowds of any kind whenever there are stories in the news of any contagious outbreak. There was similar concern when there were measles outbreaks in some other neighbors some months ago.Edited: 9:46 pm, February 09, 2020 "
Just to help put some concerns to rest.....all Coronavirus tests in NYC have come back negative: https:/…
"New York has been very lucky in that. Something we can't say here in Western Canada. The US does have Travel Bans for most visitors from China. Quarantine measures, etc. That doesn't exist here in Canada, which is actually being used as a ""spring board"" into the US, using land entries, either through Blaine or Buffalo, etc."
Flushing is basbically tourist free and not many people from outside flushing go there because of parking and much of it is not near the SubwayIts mostly locals to flushing who are avoiding the local places
"The business area of Flushing is fairly compact and centered around the Main St. subway station. A 15 min, walk will get you most places. I agree Flushing attracts few tourists and things are set up for locals. A number of restaurants do not display menus in English, which I regard as unwelcoming. Their wait staff may not speak English as well."
""" and not many people from outside flushing go there because of parking and much of it is not near the Subway"" Dunno about that. I go to flushing. Some of my friends go to flushing every week to do their shopping or eat out etc. I agree its not really setup well for tourists and I doubt it sees a large number of tourists. Restaurant I went to recently had items in the menu in english and chinese. Staff spoke some english, although we ordered in chinese. Maybe that is more of an issue for small very casual restaurants, but never something I had a major problem with."
"""The business area of Flushing is fairly compact and centered around the Main St. subway station. A 15 min, walk will get you most places."" - I agree with this. Its not difficult to get to most places using the subway you just may need to walk a bit more than other areas of the city, but the subway can get you there close enough for most things."
I have never ever seen any restaurant of any kind in NYC without an English menu.
Impacting restaurants in Australia too......https://www.timeout.com/melbourne/news/shark…
"“No known cases”?? Well there’s one now, but the key is “known”.  There are insufficient tests. Trump and his buddies don’t want lots of testing. Do you think in a city as large and diverse as nyc there’s only 1 case? I’m sure there are thousand undetected. “Racism”. Seriously? Most Chinese restaurants are run by Chinese-Americans who visit China and have Chinese immigrants who visit China working for them. And a higher proportion of the ingredients are brought in from China than in western restaurants. Not racism. But “common sense” based on statistics and likelihood estimates based on how little we know."
"This is partly a rhetorical question, and partly genuine curiosity: since Italy has now become a major, well-documented source of infections, are Italian restaurants suffering the same decline in business that Chinese restaurants did earlier in the epidemic?"
"I do not think it is a fair comparison b/c most Italian restaurants have a small to 0 % of Italian immigrants as workers. That said, I doubt the risk is higher is not higher at Chinese restaurants is not the product of racism but irrational fear."
"Good question, Linda. Funnily, none of the Italian restaurants I frequent (well am in Canada at the moment, so have to speak locally) are operated and frequented by mostly Italians! Cultural expropriation? I can't possibly go to a Chinese restaurant where management, cooks, servers etc and the majority of the diners are not Chinese. It just won't be as good."
"And now this update: Avoid kids and playgrounds?https:/…It's time to just ""Live and Let Live""."
"*** It's time to just ""Live and Let Live"".***Ain’t that the truth."
"We plan on going to Chinatown this Saturday during the day for some Dumplings. Can anyone refer us to the place YOU believe has the best? And for Chinese foodies, which restaurant in Chinatown is the best all around? Let's get off this corona talk and just talk food!!! Thanks for your suggestions!!"
"@67 which Chinatown? People can make recommendations on dumpling places. As far as best all around place its going to really depend on the type of chinese food you want since there are a number of different types. I had some good dumplings at Shanghai Impression in Flushing. I know they have a restaurant in Manhattan chinatown as well but not sure if it uses the same name or not.Edited: 2:52 am, March 03, 2020 "
Chinatown by Little Italy. We usually just do basic Chinese food...NO seafoods or shellfish. Good quality beef and nice chicken dishes are great but wanted to get some dumplings as a co worker said they had a platter and they were fantastic. He could not recall the place.
"I had Chinese for dinner at my local Chinese restaurant on the weekend. The restaurant was sort of full, so people aren’t staying away here. But it’s a very Anglo Saxon neighbourhood and the restaurant has a Chinese chef. Maybe it’s still not a big deal in my neck of the woods yet. But ironically people are still expecting the virus to arrive with a vengeance soon because non perishable goods and things like hand sanitiser and disinfectant are all sold out in the stores. Even toilet paper is sold out everywhere! That could be a supply issue though if it’s coming from China."
