"Just came back. The trilby infestation has reached epidemic proportions. Soon, all men will be required to wear them when visiting New Orleans, I fear."
Not quite..not a hat city unless it's a cap for the sun.
"Lol, were you in the Bywater? Not to worry - in NOLA, you can come as you like, hat or no hat. Do realize that the point prevalence rate for hats peaks for the year here around Jazzfest!"
Everyone was trying to look like Don Draper at a backyard barbecue.
"In NYC, the Trilby / beard combo is the hipster clone look that won't die. For YEARS we've been looking at Trilbys and beards.And when I say ""clone,"" I mean cookie-cutter conformity. The most radical thing a young Brooklyn male could do in 2016 would be to dump the hat and shave.Bywater is beginning to resemble Williamsburg. I bet the number of Trilby wearers skyrockets during music festivals and Tales Of The Cocktail!No trend lasts forever, so there's that. But this particular trend is dragging its heels."
"I buck that trend, even though William Hunt (London) created the Trilby, and still sponsor a golf tournament of that name in the UK.I favor a Panama, and always travel with at least one, as does my wife, when heading to the Deep South. Trilbys just do not look good on me (better suited for Asian women, IMHO), long live the Panama!HuntEdited: 4 years ago "
Trilby? For style only. (OK ..I do own one..haha...)I'm with Hunt. Panama...Panama...Panama. But the Boater sure looked good on me. You have to have a good brim.
"For about four years, ending about four years ago, straw fedora, sundress and wedges were pretty much the required April through October uniform for twenty and thirty something ladies (and some men) in the French Quarter.Edited: 4 years ago "
"To be clear, guys, I LIKE hats and have nothing against any hat per se, including Trilbys. And I'm all for sun protection.My gentle rant was directed at a particular hipster ""uniform"" that may have been original when the hipster aesthetic first reared its Trilby'd head, but that was ten years ago. Now, the look just seems like a parody of itself. These days, you'll find hipster enclaves in in every US city with a young, upwardly mobile, so-called creative class. There's a hipster mindset that goes with the look....but that's another conversation!; )Edited: 4 years ago "
"I know what you are referring to. In the 1990's, I did not know one art director, copywriter, photographer or graphic artist, who did not wear ""the uniform,"" black turtleneck, black pants, short boots and goatee, even on the women (OK, the last IS an joke, but black lipstick and nail color were a big part for them). They espoused individualism, but we're all exactly the same.Now, what about men wearing their hats (Trilbys, baseball caps, or Panamas) indoors?Hunt, never far from his hat, except indoors."
