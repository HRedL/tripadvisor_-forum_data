"whats the lasted word on the island ,hows is the virus there ?"
"No cases on island right now. Everything is shut down until Monday morning. Grocery stores, gas,"
"Nothing on Exuma at this point, but there are still far too many people wandering around. There are quite a few sailboats and motor yachts moving around the Exumas and the cays -- despite all marinas closed and all non-essentials banned. People just aren't getting it! There are reports that some vessels are moving into the very southern Bahamas - presumably from Florida and elsewhere who are trying to come ashore on those island for supplies. The Defense Force and local police have been told to deny them access."
"so id there use in doing a vacation ? ours is in mid june , i hate to go there and everything closed"
"I wouldn't worry about June, yet. Gotta get through April, then May!People I'm talking to on island are hanging in there. Bummed that they aren't supposed to go out and of curse there's the income issue. But they know it's better to get this over now then to have more issues later.We are arriving June 12, party of 11 to 13 so lots of planning issues but not worried about the trip till we get lots closer."
keep us posted little john
I’m so happy to hear there aren’t any cases! How about the other Out Islands and Caribbean in general? Has any island been hit harder than others?
"We are up to 24 confirmed cases -- 18 on New Providence, 5 in Grand Bahama, and 1 in Bimini. 3 deaths have been recorded. But all travel between islands has been stopped. No domestic flights, no private charters, no boats, no ferries and no inter-island travel is permitted at this time. It's the only way to isolate the islands, as so few of the out islands have more than bare basics medical care -- and in some case, barely that!"
"Complete lockdown in the Out islands is really important now to stop this from spreading , I come from an Island where we didnt act quite quickly enough and now paying the price although not as severe as other countries. but still losing 15/20 people per day , I am surprised that posters here are even contemplating vacations to any of the Out Islands in the near future !"
I've been following the Bahamas Press for news and updates...
so is georgetown on lock down ? no one in or out
"Don, what do you consider the near future? People here are posting about trips this summer, not this month. At some point, life must go on, economies must reopen, travel bans must be lifted."
"Until a vaccine is available and deployed throughout the world, travel will be restricted. A lot of unknowns out there. Once damped down, will Covid return in the Fall or next Spring? People need to realize this could easily take a year or more to figure out. And, a recession on top of that. Vacation travel and cruises will be taking a hit for quite some time. There are much higher priorities that need to be addressed first--the health of mankind. A little dramatic, but y'all should get the point."
"We had two trips to Exuma planned this year. April and October. April is out and we are beginning to wonder about October. We have many friends there and as much as we love Exuma we would not put our island family in jeopardy. For now we will continue to pray that there will be an end in sight and take things a day at a time. I am sure for those that love the island and the Bahamian people, they will feel the same. For now, many hugs from a distance."
"Massmom as Kim 54 correctly points out this could drag on for a long time , I was due to return to a few Out Islands end of July into mid August but that aint going to happen now. . Things are changing daily in every country , the US is expected to have a bad week ahead and unfortunately economies and travel bans are at the mercy of this virus !!"
"This is so wrong and so inaccurate. The shut downs have NOTHING to do with ""until a vaccine is found."" Remember everybody, the point of stay-at-home orders was not to wait out the virus until testing or vaccine, it was to prevent an overwhelming run on hospitals all at once. It is time for a slow reopen.It was supposed to be “two weeks to flatten the curve”, not to wait until nobody has the virus. That is impossible."
"The Bahamas are in lockdown. The Prime Minister is also a medical doctor and is being very cautious. Our friends on Exuma can only shop according to the first letter of their name. No flights, no ships.You have to look at the big picture, world wide. ""Flattening the curve"" is not working too well in a lot of places and taking much longer than two weeks. Yes, it was meant to help with the hospital scenario, but also to slow the spread of Covid. China is already having more problems since they opened up a little this past week. Travel will definitely be limited to/from a lot of places world wide. Actually, it wasn't that long ago that some countries required vaccination/shot records to enter their country, and some still do."
if they arnt doing flights in does that mean the sir lines has to do a refund ??
"Lilrobo- if the airline cancels your flight, they owe you a refund. Many right now are allowing you to change your flight with no change fees. Just check your airline's website for their specifics."
"If you had a flight scheduled and it gets cancelled, then yes the airlines must refund your money. My entire family had flights cancelled with AA and we received a refund easily."
"Amen, Susan!Waiting for a vaccine is absurd and unrealistic. How many people are going to be willing to have themselves and their children injected with a rushed vaccine that has not been through long term studies? I’m certainly not"
"massmom,No one likes waiting for and getting vaccines. Not absurd/unrealistic. Have you seen how many Health Responders, just in the USA, are dying as of today? It will make travelling harder to do with certain health requirements."
"i checked my flight info and everything seems fine , nothing about flights being canceled"
"Your mid June flight will not cancel this far out. Goggle exumaairport.com daily and you will see all the cancelled flights.Edited: 1:13 pm, April 15, 2020 "
"As of today, April 15, 2020.Bahama stats from CDC/WHOConfirmed Covid-19 cases 49Recovered 6Deaths 8"
"Good Afternoon lilrobo65,There are NO confirmed cases on the island of Exuma, however The Most Hon. Dr. Hubert Minnis ordered that the Lynden Pindling International Airport and all additional airports throughout The Bahamas remain close to incoming flights carrying passengers as a measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19 throughout The Bahamas. Airlines are permitted, with proper approval, to fly empty aircraft into The Bahamas to retrieve international visitors and return them to their home country.Please visit https://opm.gov.bs for the latest news on COVID-19 in The Bahamas."
lilrobo: Our AA flight on April 27 is not canceled either...but you can bet its not going to happen...they only show 3 days ahead...
"i did see that , all be said wounder if its worth going if things are closed down there ?"
One thing you can count on is the people of Exuma being ready to go once flights start arriving!It's unfortunate what is happing with our friends there but we are ready to go down to support them as soon as we are allowed.
