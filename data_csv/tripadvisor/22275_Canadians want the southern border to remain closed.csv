"No surprise there.Canadians aren’t ready to see the border with the United States reopened, with 83 percent saying it should remain closed for the time being, according to new polling.https://nationalpost.com/news/most-canadians…"
Until the number of cases in the USA/Canada are down SIGNIFICANTLY they should keep the borders closed to non essential travelThat also includes flights from overseas JMO
"That's pretty funny Pirate in light of all the reaction from some of the usual suspects on this branch back when the POTUS did take some action and people here were claiming he over reacted to what's basically the flu just to be political and got their undies bunched about a US company closing a ski area in Canada.(not to imply you were one of the people saying such things)Edited: 5:04 pm, May 19, 2020 "
I believe that was on the Whistler/British Columbia forum... out there they get themselves knotted up about a lot of stuff.
I think you're right. There were few threads and any mention of ski areas was definitely one of the Western ones from what I can remember.
Necessary and favorable and good policies by the Canadian PM should remain in place. Wise policy for sure. Our vacation will be canceled. Prospective enrollment in a degree program will be postponed. Chances to redeem this opportunity are gone. Connections with universities are vanishing and brought to a definite unpleasant finale. Prospects to visit many of our favorite places are likely not to take place this year or next unfortunately.
"No you didn't come off that way at all, Pirate.Personally I'm doing well, thanks. Boston is certainly different that's for sure. Restaurants and tourism are such a big part of it and there is none of that now except for a few restaurants doing take-out."
Other than trade goods I see no reason for the border to be open. There is nothing to do and frankly the border is protecting us.
Be honest Canadians...how many of you would have voted to close the southern border before Covid-19 even existed? ;p
I won't lie... I'd vote to see it closed until mid-November.... then we can re-assess... :)
"I would like to see the border stay closed as it is till it is evident that covid19 is under control in the US. At the moment no one seems to be in charge with each state doing its own thing and significant number of people running around with total disregard for health instructions. When someone says he or she is not going to wear a mask because that is a ""freedom issue"", I don't want to deal with people like that."
"@25 I realize you were probably being facetious, well I hope you were.Most of us love our southern neighbors. Just for now, we would probably prefer it if you stayed home...for now!Americans bring life to Montreal every summer and we will once again welcome you back in 2021...:-)"
"I agree that keeping our southern border closed is a good idea, definitely in the short term....Then again, these are such unsettled, and unsettling, times that maybe we should extend the border closing until the end of January 2021? Just to be on the safe side ;-)"

"Hank in Boston: I am sorry if it came out as if I am trying to pain everyone in the US as a bunch of ""yahoos"" as one of our politicians called the protestors. My intention was not that. I literally meant that personally I do not want to deal with people who think like that. That would include all such people north of the border too. Granted, there are people like that here also. The difference is that no one here, that includes all types of politicians, and no one in the media, promotes them and calls them ""good people"", as they have been in the US.Edited: 7:55 am, May 21, 2020 "

IIRC the poster has said before she was from Quebec. Seems there's a chip on shoulder involved.
"@Hank W, IMHO there are more than just a few idiots in our country who refuse to wear masks. The Idiot in Chief encourages ''civil disobedience,"" via his liberate posts all while restrictions were very tight for obvious reasons.  While TV et al is looking for stories to blast us with, we have people in our country almost everyday pulling pistols on those that try to require them to wear a mask. We have people fighting almost daily when someone asks them to comply with safety measures. As a retired medical industry instructor, one of my good friends is a retired physician. We're both middle of the road type guys that fish and hunt a little. Neither of us feels the need to own a howitzer. We travel and know why many people fear ''Good 'Mericans."" Objectively looking at the border situation, it should remain closed to limit the virus spread until trends not tweets indicate it is safe to resume travel. The US has zero consistent plans (save $$$$ issues relating to the election) and no agreement among the 50 states. Our Orange Idiot is not sane, he is vile, and if anyone disagrees with anything he promotes they are labeled. My retired physician friend has adopted this phrase, ""It is a miracle that America has not caused its own extinction. Ergo, many in the world welcome us and also sleep with one eye open.  Be well, be healthy, be smart. Many of us dream of traveling when it is safe to do so, not when some #$#$%%$ Idiot says so."
"Of course there are more than a few idiots in the US. And of course the border should be closed now.My point is that the US has about 300 million more people than Canada so naturally we are going beat them by millions hands down in a moron count.But you'd think on a travel site you wouldn't see so much ""Americans are this way and Canadians are that way' type of comments. So I can't help but think that is influenced by a bit too much time in front of the TV rather than actually learning about and experiencing each country. And a failure to understand what sells news.As someone who has been to Canada a lot, lived with Canadians and had them for team mates for years I think the stereotyping differences is a bit ridiculous.300 million people is a lot. Of course we are going to have some worse people and plenty of them.For the same reason the US also has many more exceptionally brilliant and just all round great people. But I'm not holding my breath waiting for anyone to recognize that side of just being a much bigger country (population wise).I grew up very close to two State borders. We all made assumptions and sweeping comments people in neighboring States. I get it. But you'd like to think eventually get a sharper picture of the reality and how sweeping comments don't really work.Edited: 12:46 pm, May 21, 2020 "
Many here are worried about the border yet no one seems to worry about daily flights from China that have never stopped? Try to get info from CBSA on this topic- they've been muffled. We have gone from flattening the curve to almost waiting for a cure. Sorry but this is draconian nonsense. Does anybody realize the CDC has changed their guidelines on how the virus is unlikely to be transmitted from infected surfaces? Probably not because MSM refuses to report it- it doesn't fit the narrative. FOX reported this 2 days ago.
"""""My point is that the US has about 300 million more people than Canada so naturally we are going beat them by millions hands down in a moron count.""""Of course you are right with that.

"When you have Governors in New York and Pennsylvania who intentionally placed the Covid sick in nursing homes then yes, the numbers are higher.

"Of course I see the difference. But have no clue what it has to do with the context of my comments.I thought it was obvious I was commenting on comments about ""Americans"" in general and we were not having a spread containment contest here as far as I could tell.But if you do want to tie it in to my comments I'm a little surprised you didn't recognize that the higher population density that results from that higher population and isolation from visitors don't play a huge role.Do think it's just coincidence and poor vs good management that the biggest outbreak is in NYC and Alaska and Hawaii are much lower than Canada?Edited: 1:47 pm, May 21, 2020 "

"Love the Flight Radar website. I could watch it for hours at a time. An AC plane from LAX has just landed at Pearson. Another AC plane from LHR has just flown by Pearson as far as Milton where it has turned around and will have touched the ground by the time this gets posted. China Eastern is arriving at 14:43 ET from Shanghai. I don't understand the comment about why flights from China are arriving? International and US flights are arriving every hour of every day to Pearson. Etihad from Abu Dhabi is expected to arrive at 15:36 ET. Passengers will have to follow the COVID procedures upon arrival.The YVR airport website has changed considerably. No longer shows arrivals and departures or navigating the airport.And China Eastern is on the radar now, arriving in 11 minutes.I am one who would like the border to remain closed. There are several EU countries showing double the number of cases per million as Canada that I think we need to protect ourselves from mingling with at various tourist attractions.Edited: 2:46 pm, May 21, 2020 "
Suggest you read John Ivison's column in the NP today. Do those safety measures inspire you?
"I read the column. Not sure why you are singling out flights from China - as noted there were flights arriving from a variety of countries, and many of them include Canadians coming home. I guess that's an issue for you? It's been widely reported that the majority of the initial cases of the virus were brought into Canada from Europe and the US.In general, most news reported on Fox should be taken with a very large grain of salt. And it would be helpful if the NP could get past their overbearing hatred of the current government, since pretty much everything written there is tainted by that bias."
When using FligthTracker web site there is no indication too see how full it might be. The overnight flights out of China etc..do show pics of cargo planes; so safe to guess about those. So it is an amazing site to follow especially if one was following it before the reduced traffic as the difference is really dramatic ; but not really a good site that provides good data for the spread of Covid discussionsFYI this is the link https://www.flightradar24.com
"Of all the articles I've read by John Ivison, that's the first one I am aware of that shows lack of research. He shows no awareness of what Canada's procedures are for entering Canada.The exemptions he talks about (those who are ""flying around"") are outlined in this IRCC page.https:/…travel-restrictions-exemptions.htmlIn the mandatory quarantine section at the bottom of the page, it says:If you’re exempt from the travel restrictions, you must have a plan to quarantine for 14 days when you arrive in Canada. This is mandatory, even if you have no symptoms..At YVR, CBSA and Health officials are checking arriving pax health for COVID symptoms, taking Quarantine plan details of these passengers, approving their Quarantine plan or sending them to government funded accommodation for 14 days, or until they submit a revised Q plan that is approved. I believe those with COVID symptoms are handled separately, such as taken to a hospital. Health officials here follow up on those on quarantine, followed by a visit from the RCMP if they cannot be reached at their place of quarantine. Is Ontario not following up on these people on 14 day quarantine? Which would be everyone given permission to enter, including Canadians and Permanent Residents.I trust IRCC's safety plans. I think they are well thought out, especially the mandatory quarantine part."
"Yes.. Ontario is following up. Police have access to the lists of those quarantined under the emergency act. However a police check is the last resort, as health officials, local services are the ones tasked with doing them. Plus there was a piece on the CBC on the weekend on the number of police checks done across the country. Ontario had more than BC (over 700 in Ontario, just under 300 in BC)One of our neighbours returned from the US a few weeks ago. They were checked a couple of times by the local health authority.Edited: 5:51 pm, May 21, 2020 "
"I thought they would be following Canadian law.To be a bit more fair to Ivison, his column is marked as an opinion piece, not meant to report the actual facts."
"PHPR your answer shocks me, I do have a problem with China and so should you. There is a second wave ongoing and didn't I read 100 million people are back under lock down? Don't play a race card with me, I could care less if it was from Mars. As for your defense of our government, have at it, many don't agree with you. Did he come out of the bunker yet?Edited: 7:52 pm, May 21, 2020 "
"Beermonger: are you saying that Canadians if they are outside Canada should be stopped from coming back? Most of the flights from China are cargo flights bringing vitally needed ppe and other medical supplies. Now why Canada does not have a manufacturing capability on these is a very good question indeed but not relevant to the discussion here.I don't believe ""hoards of infected Chinese"" are flooding the Canadian shores, which seems to be the insinuation by some posters. One should also remember that infections in Eastern Canada were initiated by people flying in from Europe and also from Iran, which is also what happened in New York.Edited: 9:04 pm, May 21, 2020 "
"FWIW I think our government has done a very good job, which is why we never developed into the same heartbreaking situations that we witnessed in Italy, Spain, and New York City. The cohesive unified approach that our federal and provincial leaders adopted from the outset stands in complete contrast to the chaos that has reigned nationally and in many states south of the border. Granted, we in Ontario and Quebec were so focused on preventing a surge in our hospitals that we failed to protect the elderly residents and staff in our nursing homes. As a result, deaths in those homes account for the vast majority of the COVID-19 related deaths in Ontario; a difficult lesson for all of us, and hopefully one that will be addressed before we are hit with a second wave.In the meantime, I don’t think we need to be wringing our hands over the planes arriving from China. They were not an issue at the start of the outbreak in Canada and will unlikely be a problem in subsequent outbreaks. Epidemiological summaries from Public Health Ontario, https://covid-19.ontario.ca/covid-19-daily-e… , show clearly that by the end of March the majority of the cases in Ontario were related to travel between Canada and the US or the UK, and had nothing to do with China, or Iran, for that matter.Early on the epidemiological summaries included the breakdown in the number of cases in the province based on history of travel vs locally acquired. Over time the % of travel related cases decreased compared to community acquired cases; what didn’t decrease was the number of cases with a history of travel to the US compared to other countries. The following numbers are for the top 10 travel locations from Appendix A, “Confirmed cases (n=567) of COVID-19 with travel history* by location: Ontario, January 15, 2020 to March 31, 2020” on page 8 of the March 31st epidemiological summary, https:/…moh-covid-19-report-en-2020-03-31.pdf . United States 168 (cases)United Kingdom 61Cruise 48Germany 24Spain 21Mexico 20Austria 19Iran 17Philippines 15France 14Italy ranked 18th, with 5 cases, and China ranked 21st with only 4 cases related to travel from mid-January until the end of March 2020. Interestingly, data from New York City early on in their outbreak showed similar results. Flushing, an area of Queens with a large Chinese community, was actually fairly unaffected by COVID-19 around that same time period, compared to other hard hit areas in the city. Keep in mind that American citizens were not barred from returning home if they had been travelling in China, yet they did not bring the virus back with them. As phpr mentioned, in post 33, studies have since shown that the majority of the North American East coast hot spots have originated with infections that came in from Europe, not China.If one truly doesn’t care about the ethnicity of Canadians returning home from overseas then one might want to reconsider if their concern (i.e. problem) is misplaced.Edited: 10:26 pm, May 21, 2020 "
"The number of flights at Toronto Pearson (YYZ) is obviously a fraction of the pre-Covid volume. Without going online to review flight statistics, I can also confirm that fact anecdotally, since our house is near one of the western flight paths for the main east-west runways at Toronto Pearson.We usually hear planes overhead on a regular basis. The last time I can remember actually hearing aircraft overhead was on May 10th, when the Snowbirds flew over on their way to Hamilton and points west.So there is definitely a significant reduction. Even Pearson reported significant drops in volumes as early as the end of the first quarter 2020, compared to 2019. When the second quarter results come out, the real impact will be clearer.https:/…2020-05-12Pearson is the largest air hub in the country and one of the biggest on the continent, so yes, there will still be a significant number of flights. Most people don't realize the large volume of cargo flights. That includes not just air cargo, but also express mail, whether for Canada Post, UPS or FedEx.Domestic travel is certainly down, with some routes closed, but there are still regular flights to major cities. The same applies to US and international flights. My understanding is that some of those flights must be maintained on at least a minimal level in order to retain the landing rights in the other country.None of that means that these flights are full. Some may be mostly empty, but there are still flights. Also, Pearson is one of only four airports in Canada authorized under the emergency regulations to actually accept non-US, international flights. So some flights that might have landed elsewhere before are now landing at Pearson.You can't cut the number of flights to zero. There are enforced, mandatory, quarantine rules for anyone coming in from outside the country, wherever that may be or whoever they are. Overall, I think our federal and provincial governments have done a pretty good, coordinated job in keeping our per capita cases and deaths relatively low.Are there some things they could have done better? Yes, and hopefully we will learn from those. But hindsight and playing armchair quarterback are so much easier than trying to figure out how to deal with a deadly and unprecedented pandemic, without any working treatment or vaccine to make it go away."
"Finding somebody to blame, whether it be China or Iran is really kind of pointless.This thing is worldwide, would have got here one way or another. Blame, I understand it, kind of what we do!What is clear is that a large majority of the deaths worldwide, occurred in nursing homes. Close to home, my province and ONT were particularly hard it. That fact is disgusting and we should all accept blame for this disgrace! We should all feel shame!So that no one accuses me of bashing, QC is a total disaster with regards to these facilities and that might be a place to look for blame."
"Harcon I totally agree with you about the LTRs. The government knew early on that those facilities were going to be flashpoints but did little to address the situation. What happened in a couple of the States is even worse as I mentioned in an earlier post. When you break down statistics 82% (as of 2 weeks ago) of deaths were directly related to LTRs in Canada. That is a staggering number. BTW, the CDC HAS CHANGED their guidelines on transmission of the virus, easily researched, funny how early on FOX was the only outlet to report it until MSM could no longer ignore it (and are trying to bury it). If anyone wants to be truly informed about this virus I suggest one looks at all outlets and put biases aside. Its obvious some wont."
"#40, I get your point but find the way you try to make it less than forthright.-It's just false that cases didn't originate in China and had nothing to do with them. Going through a European or American middle man, so to speak, does not change the fact it did indeed originate in China.-Of course a lot of cases came directly from the US as compared to China. I don't know the number of Canadians that travel to the US vs China but am confident there are thousands upon thousands more going to the US so that figures.-One's feeling towards a country and their feelings towards the race of people in that country are not necessarily related. Having something against a country that put well intentioned doctors in jail, for example, does not make that person a racist.As for flights coming from China now though......probably not worth discussing unless someone can confirm who or what is on those flights."
HANK The Virus did originate in China no need for people to travel to China to get the virus Chinese are big travellers Friends of ours are professors in Slovenia they had an exchange student from Wuhan with them in early Dec First our friend got a very bad Flu then as he was recovering his wife was struck down ..coincidence ?looking back they believe it was Covid We were on a cruise in Dec a few dozen Asian onboard .. we ended up getting sick with flu like symptoms fever/cough/sore throats ..many were coughing Covid?? a regular cold??Best advice is stay home stay safe
"@beermongerFirst, I agree wholeheartedly with the comments by you and Harcon about the terrible job almost everyone did with long-term care facilities. Having significant personal experience with them over the years, I am not surprised.The use of multi-bed rooms eliminated the ability to properly isolate patients. The total lack of preparedness and reliance on the USA and China with respect to PPE put workers and residents alike at risk. The general lack of staffing and low pay for many care workers, together with the previous two factors, was a recipe for disaster.These types of hot spots put everyone at higher risk. They have called for inquiries. Hopefully they will happen and things will not just be forgotten or swept under the carpet. Before we can open our borders again, we need to know that not only we, but also other countries, have things more under control.We have done a reasonably good job of keeping our per capita case counts low. While our death rate is also reasonably low, it would be so much better if not for the LTC deaths, particularly in Quebec, Ontario and BC. And in Alberta the meat-processing plants have skewed their results.With respect to the reporting by FOX vs. ""MSM"". I agree with you about watching multiple media sources to get a better overall perspective of what is actually happening. But a couple of comments.You have used the term ""MSM"" (an acknowledged very conservative, right-wing epithet) and then tout FOX as being more accurate on a specific item. IMO, using MSM unfortunately may potentially taint your comments as having an inherent bias in some people's eyes. I say that as a small-c conservative.When you lump all other mainstream media into one monolithic group, as MSM does, it is itself a form of bias. Claiming that only FOX is reporting the ""truth"" just adds to that perception. FOX has certainly improved recently, IMO, but they are hardly unbiased. The ""MSM"" also has biases, too, but they are not monolithic.With respect to the reporting of the possible reduced ability for Covid-19 to be transmitted from some surfaces, this is from a new study. Of course FOX jumped on it. It supported their long-time bias that this whole thing was some type of overblown fancy ""flu"" or even a ""hoax"". IMO we have to also unfortunately carefully assess what comes out of the CDC itself these days. Despite the excellent efforts of the professional medical staff, there seems to be evidence of some senior administrative interference concerning what is being allowed to be promulgated.Several other studies have come to different conclusions as to how long the Covid-19 virus remains viable on different surfaces. I suspect the ""MSM"" held back due to that conflict in information. I would call that ""caution"", not so much bias. Just sayin"".We all have to be careful not to jump on some new piece of information in isolation. There is still so much we don't know about this virus. Both local residents and future travellers to Canada will be relying on this information to try and make informed decisions, when the time comes to travel again and reopen our borders."
"#44 #45Hank, would you agree that ALL future worldwide consequences of using a nuclear bomb should be blamed on the US? Probably not, and understandably so. Please keep that in mind as you read my comments below...From my post #40:“They were not an issue at the start of the outbreak in Canada and will unlikely be a problem in subsequent outbreaks.” ... THEY refers to travellers arriving in Canada from China, early in the pandemic, in response to a concern expressed on this thread that flights arriving TODAY from China are going to lead to a second wave. I was merely pointing out that the first wave in Canada developed mainly as a result of travellers coming in from other parts of the world, the US and UK accounting for the largest numbers. I don’t recall denying that SARS-CoV-2 originated in China! At some point we all need to stop blaming China and get on with taking responsibility, both on a national and individual level, for how the pandemic spreads within our own countries.Going back to the topic of this thread: Yes I want our southern border to remain closed to nonessential travel until both countries have a better handle on the situation."
"@CanuckTraveller, nowhere did I state that FOX spoke only the truth. What I did say if you arent following all news outlets you arent truly informed. Further you state that FOX jumped on the new guidelines story. Yes, they reported the news. We both know why the rest of MSM ignored it- it doesn't fit the narrative of continuing this until December. Lastly, CDC or WHO? Are you really suggesting WHO? I will take my chances on the CDC who I feel havent been corrupted."
"Just so you know .....Enforcement update for city of TorontoWhile healthy residents are encouraged to get fresh air and exercise, provincial orders and the City bylaw on physical distancing remain in effect, requiring people who are not from the same household to maintain a physical distance of two metres in a park or public square. The City’s coordinated COVID-19 Enforcement Team is continuing their important work across the city, educating residents on the bylaw and provincial Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act orders. This month, the enforcement team has issued 53 tickets related to the use of amenities or gatherings in parks or squares and spoken to 3,725 people."
"A lot of nursing home are ""for Profit"" they do not provide staff/patients with proper protective equipment  No PPE for the workers they were having to buy there own ..but where?Some homes closed to visitors very early in the outbreak ..my friend has not seen her DH (in a home) since mid March ..so far they have no cases at his home outside of Toronto One place north of us has started having outbreaks/deaths in the past 3 wks ...what has changed ??I think we need to be providing for ourselves & not getting supplies from China or other countries This pandemic has shown it can be done ..many places have set up ways to retool & make PPE's & other essential products  Now WHERE IS THE HAND GEL for regular consumers ???JMO"
What is MSM people are talking about??
"""Hank, would you agree that ALL future worldwide consequences of using a nuclear bomb should be blamed on the US?""Sorry but that's just a ridiculous analogy and you are either being disingenuous or failed to see the obvious different between having a choice and not having a choice.I kinda doubt a nuclear bomb will ever unknowingly be picked up in the US and dropped without a conscious choice to do so.I do recognize it is what it is at this point and blame is kinda pointless other than to learn from and prevent in the future. But that doesn't make comments like China has nothing to do with it like you said any less false."
Main Stream Media.As for your query about hand gel for consumers.... it's usually right there at the front door of a store or business.
"@beermongerI think I stated my observations and concerns quite thoroughly. You can choose to accept or reject them at your pleasure. But for the record, I don't remember making any reference to the WHO? Neither they nor the CDC are the only games in town. There are a number of reputable studies out there. They do not all come to the same conclusion as the one to which you seem to think is the definitive study. As a result, I also think I made it quite clear why I felt FOX jumped on the study and quickly reported it and the rest of the media were more cautious about reporting it. Nevertheless, they did report it, so let's not imply they didn't, nor pretend it is the only study out there, assuming you are as broadly read as you say you are.I guess we will have to agree to disagree whether or not there is any interference by the powers-that-be in what is promulgated by CDC and when. I have no issue with the professional staff at CDC, only their overseers. I wish your confidence in CDC was reflected in the budget appropriations over the last three years and the support by those in the departments to which they report, particularly those who are not medical or scientific experts.Before we start opening up our economy again, let alone our borders, we need to look at ALL the studies out there and try to figure out how this virus really works. Picking one to the exclusion of others, without having broader proof and verification, can be downright dangerous. No one has all the answers yet.Edited: 12:43 pm, May 22, 2020 "
"Going back to the initial point of this thread - about the southern border remaining closed....I am wondering if things are in the works to open the border between Canada and the US after the current extension ends, with a continuing requirement for anyone entering the country to quarantine for 14 days (other than essential workers who are already exempted) . That's June 21st, I believe. What makes me think this is information that was in Alberta premier Kenney's announcement a couple of days ago that Alberta is setting up a screening station at Coutts, the busiest land border crossing in Alberta. The announcement said that Alberta is spending $800,000 for stepped up screening at both YYC and YEG airports and Coutts . Those entering Canada will be screened with their temperature checked as well as answering questions about their health and any symptoms they may have, and having to provide written information about where they will quarantine for 14 days, which will then be checked within three days. So why would this be happening now (especially the Coutts screening station... the tighter airport screening should have already been occurring for many weeks!), other than in preparation for the Canada/US border to open?Like many Canadians, I am very much NOT in favour of opening the border any more than it is now. Under the current closure, truckers and essential workers are able to cross to maintain supply chains on both sides of the border. A two-week quarantine rules out most tourism, but the quarantine requirement is only as good as people's goodwill in adhering to it and how tight the enforcement measures are."
PHPR I did think of taking the big jug of gel but it may be frowned upon LOL
"Hank, You are putting words in my mouth and accusing me of saying things that I did not say. I suggest you go back, re-read what I wrote, and try to reflect more on my message. If you still can’t get beyond where you’re at, I’ll live with that ;-)Stay safe and be well."
"@ krp...From what I read Kenney said that there are still 400 internationals arriving every week. I believe it is meant to bolster screening at points of entry. I would doubt that it is in anticipation of opening up the border for tourism. Right now most of us are being discouraged from non essential domestic travel. Logically, I think that inter provincial travel would happen before we open our borders to the US or the world. We recently cancelled our planned trip to PEI in July. Spoke to the rental agency and they assured me that PEI will not be letting in other Canadians this summer. She mentioned that perhaps NB and NS would happen but only in July. @iht28 ..I hear you. It is extremely difficult where I live to get any disinfectant, hand gel or other. So much for supply chain."
"@Harcon_13 - It's easy to find hand sanitizer in my area. Each time I've been in Sobeys for groceries, they've had big displays of sanitizing gel. They were brands I don't recognize, but are labelled as containing ~75% alcohol. As long as it gets the job done, I don't care what brand it is. I think there were a lot of manufacturers of other products who were able to pivot and produce sanitizer very quickly. It's things like the pre-moistened alcohol wipes that don't seem to be available anywhere. But, I find a spray bottle of liquid cleaner and a paper towel does the job too, just not as neatly.Sorry to hear you had to cancel your trip. My July trip is still on the books.Edited: 2:39 pm, May 22, 2020 "
DCH Guess my next outing is to Aurora LOL Went to Superstore at Green lane was not too bad did not see gel thoughif anyone needs a 50 lb of white flour they have several LOL
"@dch..Please send some to QC..:-).We also have trouble finding Hertel to spray on paper towel as you do.Pehaps it has more to do with where we shop.. Also, technically we did not cancel, it was the agency from whom we rented the house that did. Thanks anyway!The house we had chosen was fully booked for July and August and now it is wide open. This agency has 38 properties, I wouldn't doubt that most weeks were cancelled or will be soon...shame!Still hurts! Our original plan was Tuscany but we scuttled that in Jan...not that PEI is second best mind you, we love it!"
"I found large containers in the Pharmasave. But I also discovered our major grocery store, which has a pharmacy/drug store, had small purse/pocket sized Purell in the ""travel sized"" section of the pharmacy. So we bought about 15. Handy to have - keep one in my purse, a couple each in the vehicles."
"Indeed, there are some very good rates at the CLL. I rebooked my reservations about a week ago when I saw them. They're not just for Albertans. One of the rates, which is basically available through June and most of July, requires proof of Canadian residence. But, there is another promo that runs for the balance of the year (well, book by June 15, but stay during 2020) that anyone can access (if they can get there).I'm hoping for some good hikes. I'm brining my mother along, and while she's in good shape, I'm not sure she'll be up for the 1,000 metre ascent up Fairview. That one has been on my list for a long time. I've spent a lot of time at the CLL, seeing Fairview every time I look up, and yet I've never gone up it."
"I believe the $800,000 budget also includes money for people who cannot self isolate. Taxpayers(you:-), will house them as required. @krp..I like your never give up hope attitude, ya never know!We are hopeful for a Sept. trip to Kelowna to visit my sister."
PHPR Lucky you can find the small bottle we have looked in most stores even the dollar stores had none I live in hope of finding some soon
">> $800,000 budget also includes money for people who cannot self isolateYes, I think you are right about that. I can't believe that they are housed on the taxpayers' dime!! If someone doesn't have an adequate plan for self-isolating, then they should have a choice - either go back to the US, or be provided with the quarantine hotel & meals at a reasonable rate ... that they have to pay! @DCH Re: 1000 m of altitude gain.... yeah, I'm not sure I am up for it either but it gives me incentive to get fit! One of my hiking goals for the past couple of years has been to walk up to the top of Tangle Peak here in JNP, which is also a 1000m ascent. Circumstances conspired against me for the past two summers, but hopefully not this year! I ticked off another long-time hiking goal from my list the other day, but that one did not include much elevation gain, just fording a river and a creek (which I've never done before).@ phpr ... I, too, was storing my small refillable bottle of sanitizer in my car, but recently saw a facebook warning that it may possibly cause a fire. I think that risk is very improbable although none of the major hoax sites said it was untrue. But there were numerous sites with warnings that high alcohol content sanitizer should not be stored in anyplace prone to high heat, which, now that spring is here, includes a car parked in the sun. So I don't keep it in there anymore, just at the entry with my car keys.Edited: 4:15 pm, May 22, 2020 "
"krp329,""I understand the need for increased screening at airports, but why at the land crossing?""I think you're making way to much of that although I didn't make it through the entire novel so forgive me if I'm taking anything out of context. I'm sure the intention if not to keep the border closed forever and the need for screening at land crossing is obvious and will be for probably years to come if not forever.That's probably not the type of thing that could be set up overnight. It would figure they are setting it up asap so they are prepared for then the eventual day comes. But I don't think it says much about when that day will be."
"“I understand the need for increased screening at airports, but why at the land crossing?""Given that most cases in Ontario and Quebec initially came from the US and the current situation south of the border, I think it is understandable:https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/canad…Edited: 4:52 pm, May 22, 2020 "
"RE: setting up screening at land border crossings. @Hank said: That's probably not the type of thing that could be set up overnight.FYI BC has had that in place for over a month at the airport and land crossings as the Feds were not doing it. A friend with Canadian passport, who spent the winter south, got caught when it changed; They drove back from Phoenix, he said he first got questioned by the Border Agent then was sent to a BC Health Care station to do it over again including providing contact information. He said he was called 3 times of the 14 day period. He lives in a house, so was allowed in his yard but nowhere else."
"Finally found some sanitizer in small meat store/ veggie place. $9 for 232 mil ( aka 8 oz), Took me 3 weeks to find bleach."
"I found it easier to just order sanitizer on Walmart.ca. It's about $10/Litre, depending on which brand you get. It showed up on my doorstep the next week. They still have lots of stock online. And, I don't need to lineup with crowds. I just use the big bottle to refill my travel-size bottle."
DCH you probably do not need this info but saw that the Showcase store at UCM was open for supplies like masks/ gel Maybe I will get down there to see in person
I ordered things from Walmart for pick up it has been a real hassle. I wont do it again. I sat in the pick up for 30 minutes and then it wasn't the complete order. Ugh!
UPDATE Finally found some hand gel at the local dollar store
"I assume you guys know this and want the sanitizer and stuff for convenience in the car ect. but FYI soap and water is much better.Also check alcohol % for sanitizer. Supposedly it need to be 60+ to be good.Edited: 4:39 pm, May 25, 2020 "
HANK hard to use soap & water in the car LOLWe are smarter than the average bear here in the North LOL
You guys don't have faucets and sinks in your cars? Do you have automatic transmissions?
"Sorry, I assumed the average bear would know how to read when I typed: ""I assume you guys know this and want the sanitizer and stuff for convenience in the car ect. but......."""
"I have hand sanitizer in car, rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle baby wipes in car, a reused dish detergent bottle in car that is one part alcohol one part dish detergent and 4 parts water and the same mix in a spray bottle and some paper towels. 2 masks in my purse or pockets. Guess I am good to go."
"Obviously, they will do whatever Trudeau tells them to do and think."
And with it they will be absolutely right. Not every head of state acts so responsibly. Have a look at yours.
"Yes, Roblox. Our country has good leaders - politicians and chief medical doctors - who have given Canadians a common reason to do their individual part to stop the spread of this virus. They have set regulations (the ones I linked in your other thread) to keep people working together on this virus challenge, and safe from being infected by, or infecting others with it. The majority of Canadians know that doing their part to reduce the incidence of this disease in the country will have us back travelling and back to work, building our economy sooner rather than later."
"#82 - Canada's leader may not be perfect but I would trust him a lot more than ours! We have to do the opposite of what our ""leader"" says."
P.S. - I really miss Toronto so I hope we ALL get our act together here and we get an effective vaccine.
It might be more than making a mountain out of a mole-hill for devising reasons to refuse to cross the border. We are not convinced that writers on either side of this argument are getting the best mileage from parading their ideas on both side of the border. There is much more to decorating the cupcakes found in the bakery at the border than sizing up the qualifications of the bakery crew. Irrefutable conclusions are not innumerable or pernicious in disabling the many counter arguments likely to be used to begin posturing opposition to such long standing opinions concerning the voracious appetite that drive many good people to want to visit so many parts of Canada regardless of their orientation toward less persuasive approaches to travel that induce visitors to know better than to belittle the members of their small group just to obtain a discount on perennial favorites such as a visit to the National Gallery or places in Toronto which so many advocates of diversity and inquiry propose discussing before undertaking an intellectual preparation for doing something more substantial than watching an ice hockey game or peeling a dozen potatoes before embarking on a visit. There is much more revitalized substance in coming to terms with the issue of closing the border than to set up intellectual barriers in the form of impenetrable borders lacking an option for viewing either side with equanimity as well as forms of irrefutably blatant excuses of lacking curiosity beyond the level of eating ice cream in the Shoe Museum in Toronto on every Tuesday. This conclusion is not in favor of declaring that twelve pounds of frivolity can not be found at the Shoe Museum or at the duty-free shops at the border. Frivolity might be more valuable as a commodity. Is there a more beneficial approach to dealing with this issue than to prolong these arguments?

"@laviniam...interesting article.We love Toronto, and visit several times a year. We recently were in Niagara Falls, and specifically walked over to see how the Rainbow Bridge walking bridge to Canada was ""closed"".I fully support the border closing...and sadly get it. It's an historical closing-necessary due to the high levels of COVID in the US.""Sneaking"" into a country that clearly does not want US citizens is a new level of wrong.Hoping that life settles down so we can visit our beloved Toronto soon."
"Open the border, test the people crossing it, and only admit if they commit to quarantine themselves for 14 days. Take the address of the place of the quarantine. Take their phone number. Make sure you give them a flyer that states the $750,000 fine and 6months in prison for non-compliance. Check their out formation before admitting. Require they produce a rental contract. Contact the rental property owner to confirm. Ask them how they are doing to get groceries while in quarantine. If it takes 6 hours at the border to check them out, so be it. Property owners from the US who spend a few months in Canada in their property are willing to undergo this procedure. They can quarantine in their houses in Canada for 14 days. This procedure will stop 95% of tourists who come i to Canada for a couple days or a couple weeks. However, it will allow those who consider Canada their second home to come through.Don’t forget that this is a two-way street. We can block out side of the border, and the snowbirds will be stuck in Canada for winter this year. If you keep treating us like garbage, we will reciprocate in kind."
I don't think it is a matter of treating anyone like garbage.Restricting travel is a tool to help defeat the virus.We still have travel restrictions within Canada.In my case I live in cottage country Ontario.Here we have only 9 cases total and 1 death.In Toronto they have thousands.I welcome them to come here if they follow the virus guidelines but too often they do not.
"sirohza, a six-hour back-up at the border crossings while the CBSA agents are checking all of that will slow down the essential traffic that goes back and forth ... the truckers, and especially the thousands of Canadian healthcare workers that live in Canada but work in the US. And who is going to pay for all the follow-up and extra work and testing? Too bad for the snowbirds ... but they won't be able to get health insurance to cover possible covid exposure anyway, and they'd be insane to go south without healthcare coverage. As our public health officials keep reminding us ... we need to keep our bubbles small, and stay close to home. Canadians are being asked to stay within their own provinces; in fact, some provinces are still not recommending any non-essential travel at all. Closing the Canada/US border protects all of us, on both sides. Several Canadian provinces and territories are doing the same thing, keeping their borders closed to all but their residents."
siroza: Canadians can fly to the US from any Canadian airport that has flights. It is only the land border that is closed to them. There was a CBC article about that the other day. A woman who wanted to cross to visit her grandson in Seattle who was sick was stopped by the US Border Officials and they told her that she cannot cross the land border but she can go back to Vancouver and fly to Seattle. She did that and she was allowed in without any questions.
As a final preemptory follow-up suggestion before avocados descend on your houses in baskets of fruit: Why not use your time to obtain a university degree or its intellectual equivalent for spending time reading books in the library or eating lunch with people who wants to discuss certain provinces in Canada and in this way come away with a degree in things Canadian rather than prolonging these scurrilous discussions that dissolve into arguments and self-generating debates leading to the deep end of the cultural swimming pool without a life guard available to rescue you. Advantages of loving and admiring Canada through serious study of the whole nation or certain provinces and cities and regions are nothing like finding time to wash and wax your car before venturing off to the near by border crossing loaded down with your blue ice hockey uniform and three picnic baskets full of scrumptious delectable apricots and cod fish sandwiches. A university degrees in things Canadian is worth more than spending time looking at the Welland Canal in the dark on Thursdays or clamoring for more time at the gift shop and souvenir shops of so many places that offer you memories of visiting Canada only after you visit the National Mint in Ottawa on Tuesdays. First things first. You do not have to pretend that you are saved from sinking through the frozen ice during an ice hockey game because your prehistoric family connections brought you to eastern Canada along with Samuel Champlain. Stop this trend of almost never ending arguments and obtain a degree in Canadian Studies for a soft comfortable landing this side of the duty free shop in either direction from the ice rink. These arguments do not automatically lead to wholesome admiration of either county no matter how determined your great grand daughter was to become a seamstress or the guardian of the cod fish house as part of initiation ceremonies promulgated by the people who protect the rights of salmon and moose. You are throwing darts too often at the same target without accumulating demerits or penalties.
Speaking of garbage...
"Sirozha, good idea! But have you thought who should pay for all the extra work? Its the taxpayer, so all canadian citizen pay for a few Americans who absolutely wish to come to Canada and cannot wait.Do you think this is ok?"
"@97. Folks from Toronto don't have to quarantine when they come to your cottage country. We, residents of the US, would have to quarantine for 14 days. The risk will be near 0% if you start allowing Americans to come through with the requirement to quarantine for 14 days. Ban air travel from the US. Let us fly to the nearest airport to the Canadian border, rent a car, and drive through the border. Let us drive across the border straight to our place of quarantine. Those idiots who lie to the Canada border agents and ignore the quarantine rules should be arrested, fined $750,000 and put in prison. Make an example of a few of them, invite the American media, and the problem would stop. Don't punish those Americans who consider Canada their second home because you don't want American tourists to pop in for a few days. The 14-day quarantine rule (as long as it's enforced) solves that problem. We feel at your southern border like the Mexicans feel at our southern border. The difference is that most Americans dont' care about going to Mexico, and a lot of Canadians to go the the States, if for a day shopping trip. So, let me be as clear as possible. We were friends before Trump was elected. Trump didn't treat you well. But, we are not Trump. If you treat us with the disdain that you have been in the past few months, we will reciprocate - no doubt about it. If you block us from our property in Canada, we will block youi from yours in Florida and from shopping on our side of the border. Americans can be your best friends or your worst enemies. It's up for you to choose how you want to have us.Edited: 3:22 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"@ #102. We will pay for our COVID-19 tests at the border. You get our address of quarantine. If we break the quarantine, you fine us $750,000 and put us in prison for 6 months.Besides, I will spend thousands of dollars in Canada while I'm staying there. That's how you will pay for it. You want your tourist industry to start recovering. Why don't you want me to come in and lock myself inside my property for 14 days so that I can then spend thousands of dollars in the area? This is all political games. There was no reason for Trump to put the troops at the northern border in March. There was no reason for him to block the N95 masks from going to Canada. There is no reason for Trudeau to keep the border shut now. We all know we will have to learn how to live with COVID-19 indefinitely. Canada approaches the COVID-19 epidemic differently from the US. That's what the 14-day quarantine is for - to equalize the rules. I've been reading hundreds of posts of Canadians hating on Americans in the past few months. I never thought there was so much hatred toward us in Canada. Trust me, we have no hatred toward you, but if you continue in the same way, we will turn against you. It's not a threat; it's the reality. You block me from my property in Canada - my second home - this summer, I will call my congressman and my senator and demand that no snowbirds are allowed in this winter. I will turn the heaven and earth, but I will make sure we will reciprocate.Edited: 3:34 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"Whatever it is. Political games or other...get over it. Canada is an independent country and we will do as we see fit. You are free to do the same.Right now I would be happy just to get a haircut. It is not the time to open borders. I have not read any anti American posts on this forum. We just want the border closed for now. I repeat, get over it."
"@ #99. I know that. It's probably an unintentional loophole. If it were for the American government, the land border would have been open. However, let me be clear one more time. No one wants to spread COVID-19 to Canada. There is a way to open the border safely. The requirement for a 14-day quarantine will prevent most tourists from coming in. Enforce the rules and punish those who break them. Most people are law abiding, and will not try to cross the border if they know that they have to spend 14-days in quarantine. Those who break the rules must be punished. The complete closure of the border to all ""non-essential"" traffic is an unnecessary punishment for those who have property in Canada or can afford longer vacations and are willing to undergo a 14-day quarantine. There is no medical reason not to allow these people to drive across the border in their cars straight to the place of the quarantine. Fortunately, most Canadian population lives within a couple-hour drive from the US border, so driving straight to the place of quarantine is quite possible. The closure of the border to all ""non-essential"" traffic from the US with no exceptions is nothing less than an intentional dig at us by the Canadian government. They got most Canadians onboard in a nationalistic frenzy that will allow Trudeau to be reelected next time because how tough he was with the Americans. I get it. Just remember that you need us more than we need you, and we are not going to take this treatment without reciprocal measures."
"@ #98. Border crossings have more than one lane. You don't have to block all lanes to check those who are coming with an intent to quarantine for 14 days. You can have lanes for truckers, and you already have Nexus lanes for those who drive across the border for work. So, have different lanes for different types of visitors. There isn't much traffic at the border right now, and there won't be much more if you reopen the border with a 14-day quarantine rule. My six-hour comment was, of course, an exaggeration. People can be checked in a few minutes (10-15 minutes max). It will take longer for each car to be cleared, but there will be so few cars that crossing of the border may actually take the same time it did before."

I suspect your thousands of dollars are no match for the amounts snowbirds pour into the southern states. In the meantime, stay safe as it appears North Carolina virus rates are increasing again.BTW - I note you haven't posted your rants on the Quebec forums, where you supposedly own property and believe you are welcome.

"As a final preemptory follow-up suggestion before avocados descend on your houses in baskets of fruit.English is my 1st language, but I have no idea what the above means in a recent entry by our friend Guido."
"@ #105. I know that Canada is an independent country. I respect it. I have always had deep respect for Canda and the Canadians.We elected a jerk in the US. Our bad. We have to do better this fall. We get it. What I don't get is the amount of hatred that the Canadians suddenly have for us because you, the Canadians, hate our president. Protecting your country from the spread of infection through your southern border is a legitimate concern and reason to keep the border closed. Back in March, no one knew for sure how the virus spread, how long the incubation period was, and how to live in the new reality. Now we know all of these things. The mandatory 14-day quarantine protects Canadians 99.99% from the virus spreading from the US. What doesn't protect Canadians is Ontario residents going to Quebec or vice versa with no quarantine requirement. So, if you really want to put COVID-19 out of its misery, you should quarantine one province from another. Instead, you are keeping the border closed to stick it to us even though we are perfectly willing to spend 14-days in quarantine. So, this is both political and nationalistic. The current Canadian government will benefit from the way that they are treating Americans. The Canadian nationalism is at all-time high now. That's why politicians start wars - to get reelected.Edited: 4:10 pm, June 13, 2020 "

And as far as I understand nobody hates Americans, there is no hatred against Americans. But it is a lot of not understanding some Americans who think if they say we want to go there everybody have to allow it. It's the same in most European Forums. Some Americans here in the forum act an write just as well. And I can understand that some Canadians get angry about the same questions for border-opening every day.Wait till the virus dissapears. We all have to wait."

#111 You are wrong if you travel to/from Quebec & probably between other provinces you are to Self isolate for 14 days
@phpr I’m not pretending. Both things are true.
lht28. There is no quarantine requirement for travel between Ontario and Quebec. The Quebec quarantine requirement was lifted a couple weeks ago. Ontario never had one.
"@RaiseBeate i am not saying Canadians MUST let Americans in. I’m saying there will be reciprocal measures because this travel ban extension for another month is absolutely ridiculous and serves no other purpose but for Trudeau and Ford to be re-elected on their hard stance vis-à-vis Americans.

All this talk about avocados has resulted in a craving for guacamole.
"Sirohza - At least you have changed your tune from a couple of days ago when you were going on about how much money tourists would bring to Canada if they opened the border now. You would be in the minority in terms of American tourists that can go to Canada to self isolate for 14 days before they begin their touristy activities. I thought you already decided that your son wasn't going to go to camp this year.Now you are just embarrassing those of us (Americans) that understand and agree with the border closure. They are not doing this to punish us - they are doing it to protect themselves! Believe it or not, everything is not about you."
"Sirohza: just to add to this discussion again, this is not because we don't like Trump or that we don't like Americans. I think most Canadians, who are generally very well informed about what is happening south of us, have decided that the best way to protect us is by stopping all non-essential travel, not just from the south but from all other countries too. Most people have watched in amazement and in concern how your government just bungled everything at the beginning, then issue guidelines and pretty much ignore all that and reopen your towns and cities without any regard to expert's advice, now is running around like a headless chicken. I know that this has become a very partisan issue for your country; if you are a Republican you will not wear a mask, if you are a Dem, you will not listen to your president. So is it a surprise that most Canadians do not want to see the border open? As the science has now established, pretty much most of the infections that started community transmission here came from the US. Not from China, not from Europe. We do not want a 2nd wave to come from the US again. You also know that there are a number of States down there that the infection is still very much out of control. Stil your politicians want to open everything. When did the country that has astounding scientific achievements in every field in the last hundred years or so became a place where people reject most science and believe politicians over scientists?Mind you Canada has its own blunders that we did in our pandemic response. Hindsight is 20-20 but there were things that could have been done differently here also. But it has not become a partisan issue here. Trudeau and Ford are from the two ends of the political spectrum here, but they still have worked very well under these circumstances. No one (yet) is trying to make the pandemic a political issue here.The contrast in two countries is breathtaking and it is reflected on the statistics too. The US which is 10 times the population of Canada, has deaths and infections in orders of magnitudes greater than in Canada. This from a country that keeps on telling us how great is your healthcare system compared to the ""socialist"" healthcare that we get here.So don't take it personally. Hopefully, slowly and carefully we will get to the normal state eventually. Just have patience."
"guacamole is over rated. There, I said it."
+1 for #125. Totally agree. And I originally come from a tropical country where we had Avacado trees in our gardens!
"sirhoza's ignorance about the country she/he claims to respect and understand is breathtaking - from the belief that there are only two politicians (Trudeau & Ford) who are somehow controlling this border closure for the entire country (news flash - there are 12 other premiers in the country - all of whom are pretty much in agreement on the border closure and not all of whom share the same political leanings as the Prime Minister) to the belief that the US somehow props up the national economy. Wrap that nonsense up with comments about how hateful Canadians on these forums are to Americans, when most of the hate seems to be spewing from her/his own posts, and you really see a true definition of the ""ugly American"" come to life..

Many preceding statements and observations and random but well directed and succinct commentary on these topics point to an interesting concluding summary that does not wander in as many directions as the previous statements might suggest might be the case. For example in one most noteworthy and succinct short essay worth reading twice the author presents many persuasive foundations with relevant support for the study of comparative government at the university level of research. That endeavor would be a worth while enterprise to consider putting on the front intellectual burner of your stove for more than slowly percolating along the dirt roads leading to a table in the library. In fact there would be a compelling argument in favor of paving a four lane highway leading to the discovery of most relevant findings needed to readily bolster many arguments put forth by that same author. Before getting land locked in a preview of ice hockey games by wearing your blue ice hockey uniform to church and to the duty free shop this side of the border for picking up discounted Molson Ale we advise you to consider to undertake the formal study of comparative government instead of looking at the Welland Canal in the dark every weekend. You can eat all the ice-cream available for purchase for snacks and lunch at the Shoe Museum without coming close to knowing heads or tails about so many dimensions of these topics should you decide to pursue a full degree in this discipline. Put aside animosities and retracted conclusions and pursue a degree.
"@laviniamThe US has the death rate and the infection rate a little over twice that of Canada’s when you factor in that the US population is 10 times that of Canada’s. It’s not by the orders of multitude. It’s a little over twice the levels. Not that I think it’s okay. It’s not okay. Canada screwed up their response to COVID-19 pretty badly as well. No nearly to be an example of how to handle a public health crisis like this. Of course, Canada shouldn’t open the border wide open it’s obvious. What I’m talking about is a mandatory 14-day quarantine for those who drive across the border with severe penalties to those who ignore the quarantine requirement. Instead, what Canada has done is a complete shutdown of the border. Forget the tourists. Forget the property owners. Canada didn’t even allow family members to see each other for nearly 3 months if they happened to have become stuck on opposite sides of the border. Guess what, if the family member on the American side were Canadian, he could go back to Canada. But, oh he were American, he wouldn’t be allowed in even with a 14-day quarantine requirement. So, obviously, this didn’t ha e anything to do with the infection level on the American side. It was POLITICAL for Trudeau and Co to stick it to Trump. As simple as that. There would be no threat from south of the border if the people coming across the border were tested and (if tested negative) were required to drive straight to their place of quarantine and stay under the quarantine for 14 days. I get what’s happening here. Trump insulted Trudeau multiple times in the past, and now Trudeau is paying Trump back. Incidentally, I didn’t vote for Trump and neither am I a Trump supporter. But, I resent being treated as a filthy savage trying to bring infection to the enlightenment citizens of Canada. I wear a mask, I keep social distancing, etc. We are not savages here in the US. We will not forget how you treated us.Edited: 9:25 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"Guido is really Sir Humphrey Appleby.sirozha,Let me fix your final sentence - ""I will not forget how you treated me."" There."
"It's amazing how personally some people take this. Kind of crazy, really. It's nothing specifically against the USA, or anybody else. That may be the only land border we have, but it's not like tourists can come to Canada right now, from anywhere.It's a bloody global pandemic, and many countries don't want people coming in for non-essential purposes at this time. It's not personal. It's just prudent, and being safe. The fact that some people still want to be travelling internationally right now is pretty crazy, and is why the closure is in place. International travel is a luxury, not a need. It will be there again for all of us to enjoy. The more seriously people take this, the sooner we might see restrictions relaxed."
"sirozha ~Canadians, and the 14 categories of travellers who are permitted to enter Canada on a mandatory 14 day quarantine do not do so on an honour system. They must meet the requirements set out by CBSA when they arrive. They must present an acceptable plan for their quarantine. Where will they stay for 14 days/24 hours a day, who will bring them food, who will bring them medication, who will be their point person? Then they are monitored by Health Agency staff with phone calls, followed up by the RCMP if the traveller cannot be reached. Do you expect Canada to pick up the tab on behalf of foreign nationals for these procedures and services?Canada's Quarantine Act is the one that pertains to COVID-19 at the moment. The maximum penalties for breaking this law are very heavy, up to $1 million.From my point of view there are two risks to having foreign nationals come to Canada. One is the logistics and cost of running a non-essential quarantine program for foreign nationals, the second is protecting the health and safety of Canadians and not putting a strain on our health care services and hospitals.""stick it to us"" ... ""treat us with the disdain"" ... ""If you block us ... we will block you."" You need to get over yourself. Trump is not political, he is completely dysfunctional. No one knows what is going to come out of his mouth at any given time, or what he is going to do."
"Continued.""an intentional dig at us by the Canadian government. They got most Canadians onboard in a nationalistic frenzy that will allow Trudeau to be reelected next time"" Here is how Trudeau would get re-elected. He is a Liberal party representative for a neighbourhood in Montréal called Papineau. Elected politicians who go to Ottawa are called Members of Parliament. The electoral district of Papineau has a population of about 112K of which about 80K qualify and are old enough to vote in a federal election. There are 337 other politicians who campaign for election in their own electoral districts (of the 337 other districts) all across Canada. If he gets elected, he will go to Ottawa as the member of parliament for Papineau. So 338 politicians elected within their own electoral districts get to go to Ottawa to serve Canada as a Member of Parliament. Voters decide who their representative will be - Liberal, Conservative, Green, New Democratic Party, Independent. So who gets to be Prime Minister? Each political party holds an election amongst themselves every so often to choose the leader of their party. The party who gains the most Members of Parliament in a federal election becomes the Government of Canada. The leader of that party becomes the Prime Minister. The party with the second most MPs becomes the Official Opposition. Far, far away from a nationalistic frenzy. I can't imagine what a nationalistic frenzy of Canadians would even look like.Who gets to be responsible for border policy? The Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, elected in Toronto. Who gets to regulate that border policy in a pandemic, when health is threatened? The Minister of Health, elected in Thunder Bay, Ontario, with the mandate to ""maintain and improve"" the health of Canadians."
"Canada should let Guido in before Zirozha...At least his non sense is sympathetic and his posts are becoming stuff of legends:“Many preceding statements and observations and random but well directed and succinct commentary on these topics point to an interesting concluding summary that does not wander in as many directions as the previous statements might suggest might be the case.”Lol whatever that was, I am starting to love that guy!Stay home this summer, drop the sense of entitlement and enjoy local discoveries: both countries will still be there next year."
"But Guido will have to buy seats for Chunkie, Mambo and all of his other personae."
I think he (Guido) is using a random text generator.
"quote:""It's amazing how personally some people take this. Kind of crazy, really. It's nothing specifically against the USA, or anybody else""If it's it any consolation the 'all about me' crowd in the US (and anywhere) takes any internal State/County/Town restrictions personally too. I see the same type of thing on US forums too. Cape Cod especially. This isn't really about Canada per se. It's about their vacation taking priority over health and safety concerns. Where that happens to be is just incidental.Any thinking less than massively selfish person understands the intent and doesn't take it personally."
@138 totally agree. Dealing with this pandemic requires both individual and collective efforts. It shouldn’t be difficult to understand.
Je me souviens.
"'Je me souviens.'? Wow. Your sense of entitlement is so great that it extends across the border into a different country. I know some people from the US that I like and I know some Canadians that I like. I don't have any hate towards the US, but I can say that someone who gets so upset about not being able to make the rules for another country isn't someone I care to have in Canada anyways.There is a reason why the borders between provinces are open. People from Ontario are Canadian, people from Quebec are Canadian, people from Alberta are Canadian, people from Yukon are Canadian. The federal government has some control over all of the provinces and territories in Canada and the people in them. It is up to the provincial governments to police their internal borders and some do.The manpower necessary to 'babysit' all international visitors is just not possible and until more people feel safe with tourists coming to their cities, the border will stay closed.I, for one, hope you don't forget. Don't forget when you had a tantrum on a travel forum because the mean Canadian government wouldn't let you hang out. Swallow your selfishness for a little while, while the world tries to adjust to the pandemic.For others from the US that happen to read this; We do enjoy your company and visiting your beautiful country, so please know that when this has passed I would like invite you to come for a visit and a whiskey."
"""Je me souviens.""Means, I remember..What I think you meant was ....I will remember!""Je me souviendrai""Either way, if you are serious about all this then please get over it!"
Go celebrate Trumpers birthday instead of showing off the few French words that you know.
Easy guys. You're either being trolled or may as well be talking to a rock. Looks like the former to me but either way no worth getting bent over.
"sirozha, I believe you are the poster missing French camp in Quebec?  There is a French immersion camp near you, L'Ecole in Raleigh.  It is only offering online classes now, but perhaps that would help your son keep up his learning.  As for overnights, maybe you could pitch a tent or fire pit in your backyard and only speak French, read French books, sing French songs and eat French food, which you can easily make at home, if you have the time.  It would be a great bonding time with your child and will teach him patience and creativity, which is required of all of us to survive this thing.Edited: 5:00 pm, June 14, 2020 "

"@Bitev. Apparently, all the avid travelers (excuse me, travellers), on this travel site want to keep the Canada-US border closed except for the steady flow of supplies from the US to Canada.

COVID-19 finally did it, so the border must remain closed for the foreseeable future.My only hope is that Quebec secedes and lets me visit to my property.

That way you will not even have to bother with a border next time you want to go to your cottage and that your son can learn French immersion. While you guys are at it, why not nuke Toronto as well? That will show those dastardly Anglos a thing or two.I wonder what you do when you want milk and the local grocery store is closed?Over the years I have seen some strange stuff said on TA forums but this one takes the cake."
"Sirizha, is not an allophone/ francophone matter. Many Quebecers are bilingual, as are people in New Brunswick and other parts of the country. My daughter here in Toronto is fully bilingual as are many of the Forum contributors and we have Franco Ontarians, and French speaking communities out west etc.This is a public health issue not an Anglo/ Francophone conflict.Added to the above many of us have spent a great deal of time in the U.S with some of us being multinationals.It is not the Anti Trump/ Anti American issue.Edited: 1:53 pm, June 15, 2020 "
"@sirozha """"except for the steady flow of supplies from the US to Canada."""""" Too funny. You need a course in international supply management. Lets start with upper NY state that gets it power from a Canadian grid that originates from NY Falls Canada."
This is getting weird.There is a steady flow of supplies going from the US to Canada.The fact there are more going the other way does not change that fact.It's almost as if some people are going out of their way to be trolled now. With all the offensive and suspect things that have been said imagining he said Canada had a trade deficit with US when he didn't at all say that hardly seems necessary if you want to be sucked in to being trolled. There's much lower hanging fruit than to respond to things that were not said.
"Often it sounds like you are playing the same game with different teams that do not allow substitutions on the basis of your allegiance to three different ice hockey teams. Please. Limitations on estimating sources of electrical power emanating from Niagara Falls on a rainy day do play a role. What happens in the interval to cumquats, Moldavian muffins, blueberries and mushrooms from north eastern Madagascar? Do four university degrees in International Supply Management have more to do with resolving these issues than selling popsicles in Buffalo? No need to venture off to eastern Moldova for ping-pong balls before finishing games of Chinese checkers at the laundry-mat if you knew more details about the production of fruits and vegetables from the island of Madagascar. So much of this cross border chit-chat does not hold water if your canteen is empty. Closing the border might have something to do with which clothes you are wearing at the duty free shop. Become more skillful and knowledgable before throwing in the towel to get better spot removing bleach needed for a third rinse. Purchasing another washing machine is not as important as a faster hairdryer and gloves. It is one strategy to ask for emendations and corrections in so many calculations to show respect for lower prices in return for a new canteen that holds water, but do not get bedazzled or requisitioned to Halifax or lost while looking at the Welland Canal on a cloudy day if your second cousin twice removed by the local sheriff is suddenly showing up at your front door eating the cumquats and popsicles imported from Madagascar while you are keeping track of your favorite hockey team. Playing euchre or monopoly at the duty free shop has benefits so do not minimize your prestige."

Air Canada is advertising trips to the US for pleasure during their hold music right now.The US is allowing Canadians in for both business and pleasure, and Canada has just extended the border closure for another 30 days, which, I'm sure, will be followed by another extension. The virus will only get worse in the fall, so this border closure is going to continue indefinitely. All I was saying was that the border could be opened if testing were done at the border and visitors were required to be quarantined for 14 (or 15) days. I never suggested that Canada should wide open the border and let everyone in without testing or quarantine.Edited: 7:54 pm, June 17, 2020 "

And for Canada Day, their local band plays all American répertoire. And then, at the end, the 30 people who show up take part in a cake cutting and eating event with the cake with a Canadian flag is cut with a huge butcher knife in huge pieces given out to the 30 people who showed up.

"“Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he doesn’t want to see the United States border opened after July 21, considering the resurgence in COVID-19 cases in many states.

Ford says he loves Americans, but Ontario is not ready to welcome people from south of the border.Several states set single-day COVID-19 case records this week, including Arizona, California, Mississippi, Nevada, Texas and Oklahoma. Ontario, meanwhile, has recorded fewer than 200 new daily cases for 10 out of the past 12 days and with a growth rate of less than one per cent for almost three weeks.Ford says the people of Ontario have been “fantastic,” but the spike in cases seen in California, Arizona and Texas are what happens when people let their guard down.”https:/…"
It is scary to see what is happening south of the border and I am not talking about the virus but the US govt response to it. Just when did wearing a mask became a 1st Amendment issue or a sign of opposition to the President? How ignorant are these people? I really hope the border stays closed and tight.
"The problem is that this virus is not going anywhere. Once restrictions start to relax and people start living more like before, cases will spike again everywhere. Protests in the US over the last 30 days really contributed to the spike in cases. There should be another solution that doesn't include lockdowns or closing borders because that is not sustainable and everyone should know this by now."
The solution is going to be a vaccine.
"""There should be another solution that doesn't include lockdowns or closing borders because that is not sustainable and everyone should know this by now.""It works in several countries where the population is not so self centred."
"You may need not lockdown the country completely, but intelligent crowd spacing/distancing techniques have worked very well elsewhere. Also, face masks or covering if you cannot maintain social distancing is pretty much essential.

"@ Botev The strategy that (fingers crossed) seems to be working here (in Alberta, but the same is mostly true in other provinces) is that testing is readily available and they are able to manage contact tracing for every single case they find. The hope is to keep the numbers of new cases as low as possible, and well below the capacity of the hospitals and ICUs. Alberta (pop. 4.4 million) has 42 people in hospital right now, 8 of these in ICU.We did have a worrying uptick reported in Alberta today ... after over a week with case numbers in the 25 - 45 range, there were 69 new cases reported today. There was no presentation from Dr. Hinshaw to explain if there are any factors that contributed to this jump, like maybe a very large number of tests completed? We are now just over two weeks into the latest phase of our reopening plan in Alberta but it had seemed numbers were stable. Let's hope it's an anomaly and not that everyone went crazy last weekend!"
"Meanwhile, I would be ecstatic if our local public health officer would mandate the wearing of masks indoors in areas where individuals, who don’t live in the same household or share a social bubble, have to interact with each other. It is the socially responsible thing for us to do at this time, imo, unless there are valid reasons that prevent an individual from wearing a mask, in which case that person should avoid frequenting common indoor areas as much as possible.For years many of us have felt awkward around neighbours who’d often wear masks while out in public; it all makes more sense now, and I personally feel much safer while doing my grocery shopping when others are also wearing masks! There is no reason, that I’m aware of, to prevent us from adopting this practice for as long as necessary, whether that means until a vaccine is available or the majority of the population becomes immune."
"@Botev: The strategy that has worked well in many countries is to lockdown to get the numbers to a manageable level. Then open cautiously with mandatory masks and social distancing. Then when you get new cases, as you will, have contact tracing people ready to find all the possible contacts and isolate only them.all this, which has worked well elsewhere will not work in your country because the people are so hung up on their individual liberties and freedoms that a lot of them simply will not entertain anything remotely restrictive to their individual freedoms. On top of all that you have an incompetent leader who seems to be too dumb to understand the consequences to the country and cannot provide leadership, or simply does not care."
Post #184 - I haven't seen any evidence that the protests caused any significant increase in cover-19 cases. There were many large protests in NYC and NY numbers have been going down. Care to share your source?https://news.yahoo.com/protests-havent-led-c…
"We get it, laviniam. Many US States are struggling, Federal leadership has been horrible, the Canadian border is close and you want it to stay that way. Everyone knows this.Other that to be smug and get in some US bashing I don't know what purpose you think the OP and subsequent beating of the same dead horse is suppose to serve on a site about travel to Canada."
Not sure how contact tracing will work in a country with 330 million people. It's practically impossible. Smaller countries can control things like that a lot more easily.
"That's not true, Botev. Of course, given the numbers of active cases in the USA right now, it's probably not doable to do at 100%, but it just means you have more contact tracers than a country of 37 million people. (Just like you have to have more of just about everything else, like grocery store clerks, fire fighters, doctors and nurses etc.) The goal here is to have contact tracers contact a positive case within 24 hours and then start contacting those they've been in close contact with. Of course, if someone has been out in a crowd, there is no way of identifying those they may have infected, but public health officials here often put out advisories ... I saw one in the news today (CBC Vancouver, online) about how someone tested positive who had been at a Vancouver strip club and the advisory gave dates and times and advised anyone who may have been there then to monitor themselves for symptoms and self-isolate if they have any.Edited: 2:30 pm, June 28, 2020 "
"I'm not sure how it is in other states, but in NY we are required to have 30 contact tracers per 100,000 people in order for each region to re-open."
"George, post 192. The incubation time for COVID-19 is 14 days. That's why many countries require a 14 day quarantine for incoming travellers. Check the NY State new case rates and active infection rates in two weeks after an event like the Tulsa rally, and all the BLM events where people are gathered within 2 meters of each other. The Governor of Georgia is backtracking after aggressively opening the economy e.g. closing bars up again. George, post 196. No idea how many contact tracers each province has. It just gets done. When someone is diagnosed with COVID-19, the Health department interviews that person - where have you been in two weeks? what are the names and phone numbers of the people you have been with? Those people then go for testing and if infected, begin a 14 day quarantine. That's how we have typically cut the head off one snake at a time to keep this virus from spreading.As you know, borders are closed by country, not province or state, to incoming travellers, Today Canada had 238 new cases. 28,537 active, currently infected people. The total cases per 1 million population is 2,736 people.Today the US had 39,007 new cases, 1,416,358 active, currently infected people. The total cases per 1 million population is 7,963 people. The ratio of sick Americans to sick Canadians is 3:1.If you are interested in looking at this chart, regularly updated through the day, the numbers are reset at GMT+-0, so you may have to look at the numbers for ""Yesterday"" to see June 28th data. https:/…countries"
"@Mufti - I suspect we have more than 238 new cases today. Quebec hasn't reported since Thursday, saying they were going to start reporting weekly. I think they've since backtracked and will start daily reporting again tomorrow, but for the past few days anyway, our stats have been missing the cases from one of our largest provinces. So, look for a bit of a spike as they catch up and report several days at once.Still, with or without the missing province numbers, your point is still valid, that we have a tiny fraction of the case counts south of the border.Edited: 8:42 pm, June 28, 2020 "
"@Mufti, in her press conferences, Alberta's Dr. Hinshaw has said that the contact tracing for someone who tests positive traces their contacts starting from two days before they became symptomatic. However, in the case of someone who is asymptomatic, I am not sure how far back they go - I don't recall hearing any details on that."
"Some states do not report number of recovered people unfortunately, so it's more likely more than 1M people have recovered in the US. Countries like the UK or Spain also don't report people who recovered for some reason.Edited: 10:10 pm, June 28, 2020 "
"Hank @ #193: Don't take it personally. It is not that we do not like you guys from South of the border, it is that most people simply do not want anything remotely close to what is happening in your country to happen here. On the whole, we have kept this free of partisan wrangling and would like to keep it that way. We don't want debates about the merits of masks and social distancing. I think most people here would like a science-based response and that is exactly what they have got. It has not been perfect and I am sure there will be many more challenges. I feel that people get scared when they see what is happening in the US. Remember, we do get pretty much all US news channels here in Canada so we can see how dysfunctional it has been down there. And I am 100% certain, if the roles had been reversed, you guys would have closed the border as tight and fast and even built a wall along it. So chill out, ride this out and we will visit each other's countries in the future as easily as we have done in the past."
"Botev, I don't know why either. The dead and the recovered are not infectious which leaves the number of new infections and the number of currently infected people to inform us of what we need to be aware of and be careful about in our activities.DCH, I'll keep an eye on the upcoming new cases stats for Canada. The new cases number for the 21st and 22nd June were 318 and 300 respectively, so not far off the number without Québec.krp, looks like AB have found a system that does the job. But I find it odd that they go back only 2 days for a symptomatic person. Incubation suggests a longer period of time would be ""wiser."" But I am not a doctor."
"I think one of the challenges with reporting recovered people is what metric do you use? Here in Alberta, if someone has gone two weeks since diagnosis, they are considered recovered, unless they've wound up in hospital. I remember reading, earlier on, that somewhere else (probably not in Canada ... I think it was some of the people who were stuck on one of the cruise ships ... yikes... doesn't that seem like SO long ago now??), what was required was two consecutive tests with negative results (that was at the time when there was a shortage of tests, so repeatedly testing people to see if they had recovered meant not testing others who might need it for diagnosis). @mufti, Dr. Hinshaw talks a lot about emerging data from studies and learning from other jurisdictions, so I suspect that there is some science behind the two-days-before-symptoms contact tracing period, as in measurements of how much virus people are shedding at various points during the disease and how much virus you need to be in contact with to become infected (which is a function of duration of exposure as well as intensity of exposure). I'm sure there's also practical reasons behind it ... contact tracers are also a limited resource, so their work has to be focused on where it can give the most bang for the buck."
"Post #197 - I'm aware of the incubation period and covid transmission. I'm a health care worker who believes in science and data. Massive protests in NYC started around May 29. If you look at the new cases since then (over 30 days), you will see that the cases have continued to decline. Many people wore masks in NYC when protesting, but unfortunately many others didn't I feared that we would see a spike from the protests but it hasn't happened yet. I wouldn't be surprised if we do see a spike when more indoor activities open up but that is yet to be seen."
"Yep, the number of new cases in New York seems to have dropped from 1,941 on May 29th, to 769 on June 28th. Good news.The number of active (currently infected people) however has increased in NY.

"Actually about a million Canadians came back from the USA, Quebec had almost zero cases when this started, then the flood of snow birds came back.Right now Toronto has a mask everywhere law, will Americans oblige??? just look at some photos.Here there are enough yoyo's from Toronto flooding the beaches. Canadians love to go to the USA, but not risk their or their families lives."
"We've been wearing masks in New York since April 15 (not everyone is compliant, of course, which is annoying). I'm sick of asking people at work to put the mask over their mouth AND nose. Too bad we didn't start in early March.I'm surprised Toronto didn't mandate masks sooner.PS - not all Americans are covidiots"
"There's a couple of reasons why we didn't mandate masks sooner - there were concerns about the practicality of doing so, availability of non-medical masks specifically, and a desire not to cause a run on PPE and have the healthcare system compete with the broader public who wastes most PPE anyhow. There was also a conscious effort by all levels of government to get most things to happen through cooperation rather than coercion,"
"Back in April, they didn't want people out wearing masks, as the instruction was to 'stay at home'. Businesses in Ontario were either closed completely, and only offering order online with delivery or curbside pickup, with nobody allowed inside the store. I was basically in my house or in my backyard for 12 weeks. But Nick is correct, as the media was filled with reports on shortages of PPE, and governments were asking anyone who had unopened boxed of masks/gloves to please donate it to their local hospitals and essential workers, as those most at risk needed it most."
Back in March they asked people here to wear a mask when shopping it was late march as i recall because I had to make one for DH ASAP in order to shop for food I ordered a couple online early April But as noted they wanted people to stay home & not be out in public We seem to be in better shape north of Toronto but no time to relax just yet
Thank you for that Any info on international travel ue from UK/Europe.  Due to travel 26/8 Chances of it haplening 1%
"212, I don't know but keep in mind that being able to travel to Canada and being able to travel there and do anything but quarantine for the first 14 days are not necessarily the same things.Given that Canadians returning from Europe now have to quarantine for 14 days I'd have to guess the quarantine requirement will linger past the outright travel ban so sorry to say I'd put the chances going to Canada and seeing the outside closer to 0% for Aug 26."
"SpursB (#212), there is already a current government order in effect until August 31 that requires anyone entering the country to quarantine for fourteen days. It is being enforced by phone calls and RCMP visits to ensure that those under quarantine are staying in their quarantine quarters (i.e. a hotel room), and there are very large fines for non-compliance.I would expect that order will be extended too, along with the other order barring foreigners from entering Canada for non-essential purposes, which is set to expire on July 31st. (There is yet another one, with a July 21 deadline, for Americans only.)"
"Spurs ~International travel to Canada for tourism, entertainment, recreation is banned until July 31st and subject to being extended, depending on the COVID-19 health risks. Any extension news will be announced by the Prime Minister closer to July 31st.Returning Canadians/Permanent Residents and some other travellers who are exempt from the travel ban are able to enter Canada. These are the ones who must undergo a mandatory 14 day quarantine. For these travellers, the quarantine requirement is currently effective to August 31st. For you, visiting as a tourist, the quarantine is a moot point.The Canada-US border crossing by land is closed to tourism until August 21st (just announced) and subject to a further extension.Edited: 2:40 pm, July 14, 2020 "
"Spurs #212Here is the exact wording, from the Government of Canada website https:/…s1 , that would apply to someone travelling to Canada from a country other than the United States:“If you are a foreign national arriving from a country other than the United States, to enter Canada, you must prove to the CBSA that you:-are listed as being exempted from travel restrictions (including immediate family members)-are travelling for a non-discretionary (essential) purpose [N.B. tourism is not essential]-are not presenting signs or symptoms of COVID-19-have a plan to quarantine for 14 days, unless exemptedThese measures are currently in effect until July 31, 2020, and may be extended.”Given the current situation south of the border, i.e. in the United States with respect to COVID, I suspect that leisure travel will not be open to our southern neighbours for at least another 2-3 months. Because of the close nature of the relationship between the two countries (Canada and the US), I wouldn’t be surprised if the Canadian government decided to restrict leisure travel from other countries as well, in order to soften the blow to Americans so to speak, but this is just my opinion."
"Spurs, are you wanting to come to Canada for a holiday? or for some other reason that might exempt you from the travel ban (which currently applies to tourists?)

I have seen report saying that experts are predicting that the US-Canada border could be shut for non-essential travel for the rest of the year.
"#217“The wording auoted in post 216 is not for foreign national travellers coming for tourism.”“I would really appreciate knowing why Canadians are advising that a tourist will have to go into a mandatory 14 day quarantine when they are wanting to come for a holiday and not for an approved reason.”|We’re both trying to say the same thing, lol.My intent was that anyone thinking of coming to Canada in the near future for tourism would click on the link I provided to read what the Government of Canada has to say on this topic. Near the top of the linked page it clearly states, “This section summarizes important information for non-Canadian travellers.” Further down the page it clarifies, “Travel to Canada for discretionary reasons (non-essential), such as for tourism, recreation or entertainment is currently prohibited. Unless exempted, if you do not have a non-discretionary (essential) reason to travel to Canada, a border services officer will deny you entry.”|==> My first sentence of post 216, “... that would apply to someone travelling to Canada from a country ...”, should have been written as “...that would apply to someone WITH AN ACCEPTABLE REASON FOR travelling to Canada...”If you look at the quote that I copied and pasted, I actually amended the second point by adding, “[N.B. tourism is not essential]”. Also, the 14 day quarantine reference is not mine, but is made by the Canadian Government to “NON-tourist travellers” that are still planning to come during the restricted travel time period.Does this clarification help? As I mentioned, we’re both trying to say the same thing :)|#218: I hope the border IS shut for the rest of this year for non-essential travel, AND I also hope that our government continues their current travel advisory for our own citizens, “While some countries are partially opening their borders, we continue to advise against non-essential travel outside of Canada.” https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories . Many of us have sacrificed way too much thus far to get to where we are currently. All we need to do is look at other countries to realize that we should stay the course for a while longer, rather than become too confident that we have the COVID situation under control, imo."
"#220To be fair, our population is roughly 1/10th that of the US, hence the Canadian total of 108,846 should be compared to their combined total of 3,355,457 cases, i.e. they currently have 3X the number of cases per capita. Canada’s highest daily increase in the number of cases thus far occurred on April 13th when there was a total of 1,914 new cases across the country, again about 1/3 of the rate per capita if compared to the total of new cases reported by the CDC today.Question is, how much worse will it get there, and will it continue to improve here? Anything can happen to change this picture, including future distortion of data: “The Trump administration has ordered hospitals to bypass the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and, beginning on Wednesday, send all coronavirus patient information to a central database in Washington — a move that has alarmed public health experts who fear the data will be distorted for political gain.” NYT https:/…link-47bd459f"
"The US CDC reported today that there were 58,858 new cases Monday.In comparison, Canada has a total of 108.486 combined cases.---------That is like comparing apples to oranges. The US has 10 times more people."
@ BotevI give you credit for not attributing the difference in the number of cases to the fact that Canada hasn’t been performing as many tests :)
"Botev, you should compare the cases per 1 Mill. citizen, and the death per 1 Mill. citizen. Than you easily can see the difference."
"Botev, you should compare the cases per 1 Mill. citizen, and the death per 1 Mill. citizen. Than you easily can see the difference.-------I wasn't the one not doing that.

"Sorry Botev. I took the numbers of yesterday. There where almost 66.000 new cases and almost 1000 new deaths in USA. Military, cruise ships and territories counted about 1000 cases out of that and 23 new deaths. So that is insignificant.https:/…countries"

"You’re welcome MuftiVancouver. I should have been clearer the first time!|“Floridians charged, but doesn't explain how they were able to cross the border.”They do explain it later in the report by pointing out that although one person is an American Citizen, the other one is a Canadian. As a result, the Canadian was allowed to return “home” to Canada and the American was allowed in as—most likely—their spouse.The information provided on the Government of Canada website states, “If you are an immediate family member of a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, you are exempt from travel restrictions and can enter Canada from the United States and from another country if you meet entry requirements and certain conditions that includes a mandatory 14 day quarantine.”I suspect this couple may not have returned earlier because they wanted to remain together, consequently they chose to continue residing in Florida until such time as the recently introduced regulation (allowing a non-Canadian immediate family member to enter Canada) came into effect. Unfortunately neither of them followed through with the requirement to quarantine for 14 days."
"Hi Mufti.‘tourists........who can't come to Canada at all, technically until August 31, but likely longer than that.‘I thought that previously Canadian authorities appeared to be extending the ‘ban’ a month at a time, but had not seen where that date had been given as the current ‘end date’ .Can you link please?"

We have no plans to travel, but need the announcement to engage with our travel company as they refusing to let us cancel if it is theoretically possible to travel. It would be really helpful if Mr Trudeau announces that tourism will effectively be stopped for dates after 31st July.I think one of the earlier posts this week on this forum suggested that an update was imminent.Many thanks"
"That imminent update was, I think, for the July 21st deadline for the order specific to entry of non-essential travellers from the United States. I haven't heard anything on the July 31st order and whether it will be extended, or allowed to expire. If I were a betting woman, I'd say that it's going to be extended."
"No one here works for the government. We are all reading the same government announcements, website pages and tea leaves as you are. You'll just have to keep checking back.Sure it would be great if the PM made that announcement - but he's got a lot on his plate right now."
The best way to make a guess might be to see when the announcement of the extension to 7-31 was made in relation to the existing expiration date and guess the next announcement will be about the same time in relation to the existing date.But the real answer to your specific question is: No.
The extention of banning international travellers til July 31st was announced on June 30th so we probably won't have another announcement for nearly 2 weeks. If I had to guess I'd say they will be extending the ban.

"So the Canadian govt has decreed that Toronto Blue Jays cannot play in Toronto given the amount of cross-border travel that would be involved, both by them and visiting teams.Good to see that the travel ban is being enforced in a consistent manner."
"Except if you read Postmedia, you will see that 80% of the 3 million people who came across the border did not have to isolate because they were ""exempt"" or ""essential""."
So that would make baseball non-essential.Good call.
"General feeling is, NO USA tourists here till a vaccine. Please stay at home. That's the polls. Now the gov't is careful to follow that. Don't displease the voters. Also, Americans -- or a significant number of them, think Canada is in some way an extension of their own home state. There have been a number of quarantine breakers etc. which just makes those numbers go up. Too many people have died, and massive amounts of money invested in keeping everyone eating sleeping cooled warmed to suddenly say, HERE THE BORDER IS OPEN to anyone who wants to come in.Vaccine comes, border may open I would say."
The border restrictions on countries other than the USA are theoretically due to expire today at midnight as at the time of writing this (1 pm GMT) the Candian Govt website hasn't extended this date. Has there been discussion about this in local Canadian media or are they literally cutting it really fine before they announce an extension as it won't be long before planes take off which could arrive in Canada after midnight local time?
"If you look on the Canada website it says ""Until further notice, most foreign nationals cannot travel to Canada, even if they have a valid visitor visa or electronic travel authorization (eTA).""https:/…travel-restrictions-exemptions.htmlhttps:/…latest-travel-health-advice.htmlSo notice has not been given that restrictions have been lifted.

Thanks phpr - the guidance you may sight should now be sufficient for my purposes. Let's hope we can make it across for the summer of 2021 instead.
"As far as I understand it, travel is restricted till Aug 21st. https://www.canada.ca/en/border-services-age…"
"@Harcon_13 - The restriction to Aug 21 is for the Can/USA land border. For people flying into Canada, the restriction does end today at midnight. Will it be extended? I don't know. But the 14-day quarantine on arrival continues. So, it does create a difficult situation for people trying to make claims on their insurance. As of tomorrow, somebody could fly into Canada for a non-essential purpose, but they would be forced into quarantine on arrival. So, it still effectively eliminates all tourism, but some airlines or insurance companies may use the fact that they are technically permitted to travel to Canada as a reason to deny a refund or payout on insurance."

All discretionary/optional travel remains prohibited."".And the Canadian government has a page dated July 23 about ""COVID Program delivery.""https:/…travel-restrictions.html""Departing from any country other than the United StatesIn the air mode, foreign nationals departing from any country other than the United States are prohibited from boarding an aircraft for a flight to Canada when- they are not covered by any of the exemptions in the Orders (consult: Travel restriction exemptions for those Departing from a country other than the U.S.), or- they are travelling for an optional and discretionary purpose""To summarise: From the US across the land border, all Americans and foreign nationals wanting to enter Canada for non-discretionary travel are prohibited until August 21st, with the date to be extended. ( I have no doubt at all.)International travel to Canada for non-discretionary travel is prohibited until further notice. That's my take based on not being able to find any gov't page or reliable news article about today's expiry date being extended. There is an official list of those who are exempt from the travel restrictions.Edited: 1:04 pm, July 31, 2020 "
Not all Canadians.I am Canadian and would love to see everything open up
"Thank you Mufti and all.The reason I asked so exactly is, that I always are asked in a German Forum when travelling to Canada would be possible. Now I can answer this questions much better.Edited: 7:02 am, August 01, 2020 "
"apullman: well over 80% of the Canadian say they don't want the border opened up yet. With the virus pretty much uncontrollable in the US and with absolutely no leadership from the Federal govt there on the issue, I certainly do not want American tourists in Toronto yet."
"In the linked articles in post 267 (both the Canada.ca page and the cbsa.gc.ca page) there is no expiry date given for the international travel restrictions. Another Canadian Government source says ""the restrictions are in effect until midnight on August 31st.""I hope that Canada.ca and the CBSA edit their respective pages sooner than later.The agreement for the shared border with the US expires on August 21st, no change."
Bottom line is no one should be going anywhere.
"Summarizes the current situation well.""Canada and the U.S. review their border closure agreement every 30 days. Several experts in different fields have told CBC News that they predict the border won't reopen until sometime next year. ""https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-u-s-…"
"Well, Hawaii wants us Canadians to visit! Might not happen at all, but the ""plan"" is to allow Canadians into Hawaii, with just a negative covid test about 72 hours before arrival. Don't take my word for that though! It seems to be changing all the time! And it may not even be current anymore, as I type this. Date for the plan is to start on September 1st.But no need to self quarantine for two weeks upon arrival in Hawaii. Of course, you would have to do the quarantine when you came back home to Canada! https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-colum…There are a lot of Canadians that own condos on Maui and the other islands, so I am sure some people would be thrilled to get out there and check on their property.Not me though!"
"It appears the USA/CAN border closure has been extended again for another month, to September 21.https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/canada-u-s-b…"
