Any coronavirus reported in Tulum?
"So far, no confirmed cases in Tulum, or anywhere in the state of Quintana Roo.Here's a summary of the 7 confirmed cases in Mexico (so far)...On 28 February, Mexico confirmed its first three cases. A 35-year-old man and a 59-year-old man in Mexico City and a 41-year-old man in the northern state of Sinaloa tested positive and were held in isolation at a hospital and a hotel, respectively. They both had travelled to Bergamo and stayed in Italy for a week in mid-February.On 29 February, a 4th case was detected and confirmed on the city of Torreon, in the state of Coahuila, from a 20-year-old woman who traveled to Italy.On 1 March, a 5th case was announced in Chiapas in a student who had just returned from Italy.On 6 March, a 6th case was confirmed in the State of Mexico in a 71 year old man who had returned from Italy the 21st of February.On 7 March, a 7th case was also confirmed in Mexico City in a 46 year old male who had previously had contact with another confirmed case in the United States.No deaths, and 1 person has recovered.Edited: 3:05 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"Thanks, MrB, very helpful. I would imagine, in such a tourist-heavy area as the QR, there will be some cases eventually reported, but if we all keep our best practices of self-care (hand-washing, etc.), we can help limit spreading."
Thank you!
thanks for the update! I'm heavily thinking if we should cancel our trip this spring break in another 10 days. We're travelling from Calgary.
You will be fine. It's a hotter climate here which the flu does not like. But love it where you live. Just my opinion.
Just returned last night and people on the plane seemed consumed by it (maybe rightfully so).I would worry more about travel restrictions such as were implemented in Europe - having a hard time getting home or having to be sent through a screening airport. Many of the people at our small hotel felt that this last week and this week may have been good times as 2 weeks from now we may be in a very different place.
"I know this thread is going to explode with a variety of opinions, some solid, some less so. I would request that everyone just keep their advice/opinions as close to reasonable, calm, non-incendiary, and non-judgmental as possible. I know things are developing and changing by the minute, so let's leave the medical advice to the professionals. I know this isn't my kingdom, so no one has to listen to me, I just hope we can all keep it chill for now. As for me, I'm definitely still planning to make my April trip. I've been looking forward to it for months now, so they're going to have to literally turn me away at the plane's door to keep me from going. I will, however, be bringing my laptop with me on the chance that I may be prevented from returning. I'll just prove to my company that I can, in fact, work full-time remotely, and hey, I'll be in Mexico! :-) But as I said, things are changing by the minute, so no one knows where we'll all be in a month. I prefer to remain optimistic, calm, and clean."
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Very much a personal individual choice been in riviera maya a week no issues No screening at cancun airport Just everywhere like a normal holiday
"There has been very little testing in Mexico for COVID-19 due to there only being three testing centres (Bloomberg report March 11) so it is very likely that there are a lot more unreported cases. Also keep in mind that tourism is a huge industry in Mexico and they do their utmost to keep it going, therefore keep negative reports quiet.We flew home to Canada from Cancun airport on March 8 and it was obvious that the plane had not been cleaned at all between flights - used kleenex in the old airsick bag in the seat pocket, food and food wrappers on floor at my seat, no hand towels in the washroom. When I wiped down my tray the wet wipe came back brown. Travel at your own risk, but be prepared to self isolate for 14 days when you return home."
"Today, the Canadian government warned against international travelhttps:/…"
"""but be prepared to self isolate for 14 days when you return home""Yup, my workplace came out with a policy today. If you leave Canada, work from home for 2 weeks. Pretty much echoing with what the province ordered for schools since they know so many kids will be away.A ban on international flights is NOT off the table at this point.The point of all this is to PREVENT a situation where 10 cases grow to 100, then a 1000, 10k, 100k, 1 million, 10 million in a matter of weeks."
"Alberta and British Columbia both have confirmed Covid virus cases from people returning from Mexico. It's there, be careful."
"If the governments of the world had their way, nobody would have any fun. My ETA is 3/19."
"Skibum1957, that's most inane and thoughtless post I've seen in awhile.And don't bother to slam me ... there is no mature response that conforms to your statement. Any response would just make you look more out of touch and insensitive.Edited: 8:54 pm, March 13, 2020 "

"Hopefully recently they have upped their game at Cancun airport, however on March 8 at terminal 4 there was no soap in the women's washroom near gate 32 and no hand sanitizer. Considering one has just gone through security and the entire airport, that was less than ideal.I asked a cleaner to refill the soap dispensers and she said she didn't have any.I actually regret going out of my country during this time, the risk I have opened myself and my family up to was not worth it."
"I voiced similar concern about the airport in the Cancun forums. It doesn’t look like at this point the airport is doing much to help with the Petri dish situation that is the arrivals area of the airport, with people from all over the world converging into a single line. Unfortunately it looks like we will be missing out on our annual trip this year."
Reason why governments are shutting down the borders is because they need to try and stop so many people having this virus all at once. The hospitals will not be able to cope. It may be wise to heed your government's advice.
We fly from the UK to Cancun on Tuesday with First Choice. They are saying if we choose not to fly we lose 100% of our holiday. We cannot afford to lose thousands of hard earned pounds so therefore we are travelling.
""" We cannot afford to lose thousands of hard earned pounds""Wait a sec, you're from Greece and pay in pounds?Better get ready to spend a few thousand more if international air travel is halted and you get stuck there for weeks. This is not certain but it is being discussed. USA-EU restrictions is just the start."
"It is unfortunate that they would not refund at least some of your vacation if you do not take it, perhaps calling the airline or hotel might get you something. However, the money is spent. You felt you could afford to take your vacation and bought it. But now is the time for people to ask themselves, what is my life, my family's life, my co worker's life, anyone I come in contact with's life, worth? As a previous poster said, it might not necessarily be you who suffers, it could be who you might pass it along to who will. A flight from the UK is in excess of 10 hours in close contact with hundreds of people, then security and customs at the airport with thousands of people. Where are these others from? Forget about it being Mexico with a skewed reporting of cases, think of who you will be in contact with and where are they from. The only way to get through this with the maximum amount of high risk people surviving is to limit social interactions so as not to have too many sick people all at once putting a strain on healhcare systems. Look up ""flattening the curve"" for how it needs to be done. And that means re examining taking international vacations during a worldwide virus pandemic.I am currently in self isolation for two weeks as per my country's directive. Can everyone else take a further two weeks away from work if their country does the same?"
"Yes we earn our pounds in the UK then convert into Euros. Our holiday is with a UK travel agent so we also paid in pounds, I agree entirely and wish First Choice would cancel and give a full refund but this holiday has cost over £6000 plus flight from Greece, a night in Thessaloniki, 2 nights in Gatwick, car parking, diesel etc. Greece is in lockdown so our hotel tomorrow is only providing room service in the evening and for breakfast. We have just spent over an hour on the phone to First Choice and they are still saying that the flight is going ahead, Last time we looked the flight was full and we have checked the flight daily and it is going so there are still plane loads of tourists arriving daily not just us."

"Aside from closed border risks, and international air travel risks, there's also the risk of airlines/travel companies going bankrupt.I cancelled my trip with WestJet Vacations yesterday (no refund, but now I have credit valid on another trip as long as I book within a year). They'll do that as long as you do it 72 hours in advance.Yesterday, AirTransat announced they will do the same as long as you cancel before 24 hours prior to departure."
"Not First Choice! Choose to not fly, lose 100% unbelievable,!,!"
Has your country advised against international travel? If so you might have some leverage to get some credit or refund.
"Cut n paste...Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) travel adviceForeign & Commonwealth Office travel advice is constantly under review, so that it reflects our latest assessment of risks to British people.In response to coronavirus measures we are advising against all and all but essential travel to some countries, cities and regions. You must check the travel advice to the country you are travelling to."
"From the OP: ""Any coronavirus reported in Tulum?""The states of Quintana Roo and Yucatan have reported their first confirmed cases...https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g15080…"
"Official word from the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs just moments ago.""OFFICIAL ADVICE TO CANADIANS ABROAD: We recommend that Canadian travellers return to Canada via commercial means while they remain available.""That ""while they remain available"" phrase sounds like a signal that something major will be announced in a couple of days."
"we cancelled out trip to mexico, for end of march, westjet was very nice to give us a credit to travel any time up to a year, even though we booked our trip in november. we dont want to risk it better to be safe than sorry. even if we dont catch the virus we can still be a carrier of it and spread it to others. as far as temperature wise, it hasn't been tested yet and confirmed if this virus does or doesnt survive in the heat. more studies need to be done about this."
"It might be that Canada believes that the US is going to close the border between our countries, so Snowbirds might get stuck."
If necessary I hope they do. Anything to contain the virus.
"The virus is a pandemic which means by closing down the borders will only slow it down, it won’t contain. England will close its borders soon so I hope it is in time for those who have booked TUI/First Choice for any destination because leaving your borders now could risk not getting back. There are thousands of people who have spend thousands of pounds/dollars/euros who are at risk of losing the money. I am one of those."
The reason we booked with First Choice is reassurance that they are one of the big companies still operating in the UK. Easyjet have offered a full refund but not FC.We have the additional risk of getting back to the UK but not being able to get back to Greece. We leave today for Thessaloniki but are checking hourly to see if The holiday gets cancelled.
"Good Luck Engineer, hope all goes well, this is a nightmare. Went passed a TUI shop this morning, packed with travellers trying to cancel."
"We watched the Tui dreamliner take off to Cancun this morning on Flight radar. Currently driving to Thessaloniki passing lorries with German, Bulgarian, Cypriot and Italian licence plates!!"
"""Canada believes that the US is going to close the border between our countries""It will be a joint announcement. I can tell you there is a lot of talk going on between Ottawa and Washington.To paraphrase WInston Churchill, we are at the beginning on the beginning in North America. China, South Korea, and Italy are much further along."
"Flying private in next weekend, not worried about a thing. It's Tulum time"

My point in post 38 just happened. Commercial air travel restrictions are only going to go one way for the foreseeable future - more of them.
Just popped in here to see how folks around here are responding to the current crisis. Sad to see that some of the usual suspects (one a DE at that) are up to their usual BS. It's beyond irresponsible. Selfish fools. You reap what you sow.
"Just noting that things are changing by the hour, and judging people on their responses/reactions from even two days ago may be unfair. My own thoughts have evolved substantially even since Sunday, but my feelings about keeping things calm and informed on this forum have not. Please go easy on the name-calling."
"I'm sorry. Actually not sorry but traveling into Mexico from anywhere right now is very selfish. Enough said. Also yes covid is now in Cancun and Tulum.Edited: 2:13 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"I just left Tulum yesterday (i live there part-time) to return to Canada. Hotels are closing in Tulum, stores are closing, restaurants and bars. Thousands of people just got laid off, who were already making minimum wage. I would be careful travelling there for the next little while-- thousands of desperate people. Also, I personally know of a few people there who have all the signs of Corona virus, but there are no testing kits except in Cancun and Chetumal. The virus is there, we just don't have the means to test for it."
"Thanks for the information, Global, glad you're home now."
"We were so very sad and disappointed that we had to cancel our Anniversary / Bday trip to Tulum that we had been planning for 7 months. We had paid almost all up front at Ahau and Kanan (due to a few changes). They were kind enough to offer us a credit to use anytime within the next year. So very kind of them! My concern is that this situation will have devastating affects on the hotels in the region and many will be forced to close and not be able to re-open. I want to leave the money with them to use now, as I know they need it. But I am concerned they won’t be able to fulfill their promise for a future stay. Moreover, we’d love to try to get there as soon as possible, once things have cleared up. Is July too soon (as we are supposed to use our airline tickets by July)? I know this is a tough one to answer. Can anyone offer any insight? My heart is breaking for them! Thanks in advance!"
"Well that's a tough one - as the rate of deaths in the states is showing no signs of slowing. Many experts say this will last far beyond the ""Easter"" goal that was put out yesterday.So much has changed in just one week - I heard today from someone there that La Eufemia and many things on beach road closed.But I'm also hoping that my early summer life will return to some sense of normalcy. I'd love to go in August.It's interesting - non- communist countries like South Korea and Japan have really got a handle on it - and much of that has been attributed not only to testing but that the population has a greater sense of an overall good for society as they go about their lives. In the US we still have beaches open - many fear we are still not taking this with the level of alarm that we should...,"
We left there on Tuesday and spent a few days in Xpu-Ha till we left Mexico on Saturday. While in Xpu-Ha my wife got sick with gastro issues and we had a dr come to the hotel. He told me that they had active cases of corona that were not being reported. When we left the hotel was ( Esencia) only had about 12 out of 48 rooms booked. Hope it doesn’t last too long and the locals are able to survive. The sweetest people!
"Erin, of course no one can say, but of all the properties on the beach road that should weather this event, it would be the Ahau family. I am also hoping to get down there just as soon as we are allowed to go (and reason supports), and June or July is what we're thinking as well. If your airline is allowing free cancellations for reservations made/changed now, I would go ahead and book for whatever date you wish. And as for your airline tix only being good until July, I would contact them about that as well--all of these ""deadlines"" should be a lot more flexible these days. One note on a post above, Eufemia is still open (as of today), but their street-side sister property, I Scream Bar, is closed (it's so popular it gets too crowded). Eufemia has moved tables and chairs to allow for social distancing as much as possible."
Well there are 2 reported cases of the virus now in Tulum. Wondering how this will play out
"Update from Sunday, 29 March 2020...Quintana Roo has 42 positive cases of Covid-19.Positive cases of Covid-19 in Quintana Roo by municipality:Bacalar 1Benito Juárez (includes Cancun) 29Cozumel 1Felipe Carrillo Puerto 0Isla Mujeres 0José María Morelos 0Lazaro Cardenas 0Othón P. Blanco 1Puerto Morelos 0Solidaridad (includes Playa del Carmen) 8Tulum 238 patients are in social isolation, while four are hospitalized .Of the total positive cases, 25 are men, and 17 women.Source: https://translate.google.com/translate…"
And I would triple those numbers at the very least.
"Does anyone know if there are Covid Testing sites in Tulum? If so, where? And how long until you get the results. Only asking because we are from Hawai’i and would need to be tested 72 hours prior to arriving back to the islands. If anyone has any info that would be great."
"Doubt you will get any testing in Tulum without symptomsWhen you return home, will you go into 14 days isolation??"
Yes Hawai’i effective August 1 will be enforcing all returning residents and visitors to provide a negative Covid test 72 hours prior to arrival back on the islands.
what they don't tell you....https:/…
"I was wondering the same question, due to the fact that we are traveling end of August"
