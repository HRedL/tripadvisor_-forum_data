I don't know if any of you are following the information about all the crews that are stuck on various cruise ships...and still floating around going nowhere. But this article will show you the sadness that is involved with that going nowhere idea. Crews are away from their families and loved ones...and just no longer can deal with it. Truly sad.. This article talks about 6 who have taken their own lives due to depression and sadness floating nowhere and not being able to get to their home country to see families. Rest In Peace.https:/…
"I, for one, am intimately familiar, as I still have both friends and family aboard a couple different ships. They're getting home slowly but surely. We had 130 or so returned this weekend via Disney and RCI thankfully. And have had a couple hundred over the last two months. But there's still some out there, with no end in sight They're mostly all in good spirits, but like all of us - have some despondent days too. It's incredibly difficult to be stuck with no end in sight - but then, that describes a whole whole lot of the world's situation right now too. I know our government is doing what they can, in conjunction with neighboring islands, to bring our people home - but it is incredibly complex given the border closures all over, quarantines if you enter some countries, distances, and being spread out. My heart goes out to them, for sure. As it does for my other friends and family members still trapped overseas, albeit on land.."
"Probably the main issue is one of money, as are most issues.The CDC requires private transportation for these workers to disembark.The cruise lines don't want to pay for return flights or any expenses associated with international health and safety practices, and most of the workers probably cannot afford the cost.The home countries cannot afford to bail out the staffs and may have their own restrictions for re-entry (multiple weeks in quarantine--who pays?).Some of the home countries may also be in very desperate straits so workers may return to even harsher conditions than on the cruise ship.These are all issues that potentially returning passengers should consider as cruise lines try to restart.Edited: 7:15 pm, May 28, 2020 "
"My ""assumptions"" are always based on reading lots and lots of current news, research, etc.You are proposing many logical solutions, but life is usually always more complicated, and again, money rules.For more details, please see the Tampa Bay news story below:https:/…"
"I have been reading up on cruise news. If I can't cruise, perhaps I can e-cruise (just like e learning since physical classes have been discontinued). I had wanted to discuss this topic on our little community but decided against it as it is a sad topic.Anyway,1. Surf ( your transporter is back online!) - the cruise lines are indeed using their own ships to ferry the bulk of their crew home. This is a bit old articlehttps:/…2. CDC does allow crew on shore (US CDC) but there are quite a few hoops and legal stuff that it is not used often. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/tr…3. Mary, I wonder what you meant when you said "" These are all issues that potentially returning passengers should consider as cruise lines try to restart. When cruise lines restart, those hoops will have been jumped thru. Also, the Carnival Plan to gradually restart (which has been copied by the other lines) will allow them to adjust capacity to demand and thus keep prices from a free fall. That they start out with only 6 or 8 ships will allow them to staff it by drawing from their other ships that are in cold layup. I have a feeling that those suicides are not only due to simple despondency per se at not having a job or anything to do but might also be due to what consequences the layoff will bring back home. For instance, a crew member might have computed his income and have a bought a modest house (big deal in 3rd world countries). Then he has no job and family is about to be homeless. Or someone needs medical care and the money being sent home is no longer available."
"https://www.travelpulse.com/news/cruise/carn… This is for carnival. There are similar articles which I saw but could not locate now for RC and I believe NCL.We have to take numbers mentioned in news with a grain of salt. In the article quoted my Mary, it says 100k cruises members are still stranded on ships . Article dated 5/18 but no number of ships mentioned.In this article by ABC news dated May 4, it says 80K crews in 120 ships.https:/…"
"The 100,000 number still stranded at sea is very old news. The ships have been dropping passengers at home countries for weeks. Virtually all lines and ships are involved. Most all lib s have had multiple meet-ups at sea to transfer crew around to get neighboring country nationalities together to make transport more logistically reasonable - while also having to balance having appropriate crew aboard to actually run the ships. We have had 5 different ships port here to drop off crew (well, one ship twice, for that matter), over the last 6 weeks or so. It is ongoing. There's loads of ships around the Philippines as that's where a bulk of crew on most lines are from; from my friends aboard there, the Philippines have had a phased offloading so as to not overwhelm health facilities, testing, etc. So even though some were offshore three weeks ago, they were only allowed ashore this past week, and so on The US CDC did play a role also, particularly for the US crew, or those nearby (Canada mainly). That was essentially resolved and those crew are mostly home.It's the smaller countries (the Caribbean countries, smler African countries, etc for instance) that don't have the resources or clout to pull rank to force other countries to allow their crew to pass through the various countries to get home. It's a tough, logistical nightmare all around. For instance - even here - if all the crew that was aboard ships had came home at once (or even within a week of each other), they would overwhelm our quarantine facilities and we would have had nowhere to put them, no way to check them, no way to safeguard home population and ensure their health and safety too. It's not as simple as fly or ship them home, in current circumstances..I have a friend aboard Royal Princess, and engineer, who's married to my cousin, and they live in Italy. He won't be home for 3-5 months, as the ship makes it's way from west coast USA to Philippines, to various Asian countries, through middle east and Australia, etc and back up into Europe - assuming they don't get hit with other issues, health quarantines, etc - they'll be dropping crew all along the way.. his contract ended last month. It's a nightmare, in some ways - yet his wife and 1 year old, and by extension all of us - also know he's very likely safer and healthier there than he would have been in Northern Italy the past three months..The returning crew is also often facing very real difficulties at home - most work ships for the opportunity to make more money than at home, and home now has virtually zero opportunity to make any money. Tourism here has been literally zero since March. We'll see the beginning of it next month, which may mean 100 guests overall a week - if that. Which means, those crew will have no jobs here either. Which is also quite distressing..It's a truly horrific, horrible, stressful, distressing, unbelievable time for the crew - along with much of the world.My heart goes out to them, for sure. I Skype with some every other week or so and it's both great and depressing at the same time. Most (truly, most all) realize that overall, they're much better off where they are than being home - but that doesn't lesson the stress they have worrying about family at home, wondering when they'll get home, uncertainty and so on.It's truly tough, all the way around."
fear is a great factor in letting people off the ships even if they have been in quarantine for 2 months on the ship with no active cases Yes it is sad that they cannot get home to see their families but as CREED noted they are probably safer on the ship plus they do not have all those demanding self centred pax to look after so it might be boring for them  I will all of them a safe return home
SURF off topic here but as for corporate greed have you looked at some of the US companies & corporations who put their money offshore so they do not pay tax in the USA while reaping the rewards ?
"Yes Surf, a touch naive For a real life example: Vision of the Seas dropped off 73 Lucians to St Lucia on Monday, May 25. And 29 Vincentions to St Vincent on Wednesday. St Vincent tested the returning crew for exposure aka antibodies and found 23 of the 29 had been exposed, and thus were doing expanded testing for actual virus, while all went into quarantine. All 73 Lucians went straight t quarantine with no testing (we don't yet have an antibody test here). Given those 73 were aboard with the 29 for weeks, it's 100% for sure that at least some of them have been exposed, and some may actually be positive - and asymptomatic at the time. Hence - all returning crew members went into government quarantine for 14 days. These ships haven't been sailing to nowhere. Crew has been moved around, they've been posting and had contact with land based staff in multiple ports, etc. There hasn't been any major outbreaks reported, nor deaths, thankfully. That doesn't mean the virus hasn't been a part of their experience too...It's not a simple ""get a flight and get home"" equation - when most countries have closed borders, flights aren't available, quarantines are in okay and so forth."
"Surf - again, a touch naive. The science is changing quite frequently as scientists continue to learn more about this virus, how it's transmitted, how long it's contagious, whether having antibodies give any immunity (and with many getting it again after already having it, hmmm), how much of a concentration may convey any immunity if it does, which strains are more virulent than others, and so on - it's not ignorance. It's an abundance of caution in countries with very limited healthcare systems and facilities. And in my country, further caution for a country that's had extremely few cases, hasn't had a positive in 26 days and counting, and hasn't had a death - mainly due to some drastic, quick decisions when needed. Caution, not ignorance."
"By all means, please share your science that is beyond what Health departments around the world know and are still learning. I'm all ears, always happy to learn new info. I'll be sure to pass it on to my Health Ministry, and PAHO. I have yet to find one official source that says definitively, or even with some degree of confidence, that testing positive for antibodies conveys immunity. Or that testing positive for antibodies means you can't also have an active case and be asymptomatic, or have an active case and be symptomatic. Or that having been exposed, or had it in the past, conveys immunity either. Speculation, yes. More testing needed, yes. Widespread Antibody testing to get a much much better idea of how far Covid has spread, absolutely. Antibodies basically simply show exposure at some point - not anything else, conclusively, at this point. It is not unlikely for disembarking crew members, who have been shuffled from ship to ship, had crew aboard in contact with land side who may have picked up the virus, etc to test positive for the virus itself, in spite of also having tested for exposure, aka antibodies. It's happened with past crew members, who had been isolated aboard for weeks already with no passengers. It wouldn't be unheard of for it to be the same in these cases. Per CDC, WHO, PAHO, ECDC, etc. At least, from what I've read, as recently as this week. I'm always happy to have more knowledge than less. I am not an epidemiologist, scientist, Doctor, nurse, researcher - I rely on the experts for their knowledge in such scenarios, and am always glad of new knowledge.Edited: 2:16 pm, May 29, 2020 "
"What many people don't understand is that there are NO airlines going to some of the countries these workers are from...the airlines can't afford (!!!) to send them home...and even if they could find an airline...they will not be able to get into their own countries...as the borders are closed in those countries as well. Just because they are a citizen of some country does not mean that country has to let them in...and if they did they would force quarantine on them after all that. Look at air traffic...there is none...only here in the USA can be fly domestically...and a few flights daily to Mexico. Remember...the airlines NEED to use their gates at their home base...as well as at their flying destination in order to retain those gates. This is a huge deal for the airllines. Many of these airlines have paid millions...and swapping out gates in different airports...charging another airline millions of dollars just for one gate... That is why start up airlines often fail...they have no gate area...and do not have the money to pay millions for access. Being in the industry for both travel, airlines and cruises since 1974 I have lots of experience and learned education. Working executive troups on major cruise lines for over 10 years gave me a total different view of cruise life...and what my friends put up with working on the ships...as well as the corporate offices that I had to work with, too."
