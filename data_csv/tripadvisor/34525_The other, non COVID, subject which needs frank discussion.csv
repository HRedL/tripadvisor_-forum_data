Good list.I will add be aware of fire restrictions which can vary county to county. Many areas are not allowed to have them in dispersed camping areas now because of severe drought. Even if you see a rock fire ring.If you are allowed to have a fire make sure its dead out before you leave or go to sleep.
"Thumbs up Steve! Very busy in the backcountry this year. Id also add: that if you're hiking in areas over 10'000 ft, perhaps carry more than a water bottle. I've seen my fair share of people in shorts and t-shirts, no ""day pack"" with extra clothes or food, get caught in high winds or a hail storm. Weather changes in a heartbeat at high elevation. You can get in trouble fast when it's windy and wet and no extra clothes or a shell. Just because the weather in Steamboat is supposed to be 85 and sunny, doesn't mean the weather in all the higher wilderness areas will be the same. Like I said be prepared with more than a water bottle.Good List!"
"Our forests are on overwhelm this year and we still have August and hunting season to go. Please tread lightly. We tried to go to ""Lost"" Lake during mid-week and it was like July 4th. Now calling it Found Lake.I spoke to FS recreation staffer this week and she said that they have never seen anything like this and just cannot keep up in the areas that were not already highly regulated.Edited: 8:04 am, August 05, 2020 "
"Well done! Adding to your point on 3, people you need to mask up when passing people on the trails. Often it's impossible to create enough space. You're either putting someone in danger or eroding the trail.I too have a COSAR card. If you're going to be in Colorado using our resources consider a donation to the local trail maintenance program or volunteer some time for trail maintenance. the locals will appreciate the effort."
"I like to follow the 7 principals of Leave No Trace ethics.*Plan ahead and Prepare*Travel and camp on durable surfaces*Dispose of waste properly*Leave what you find*Minimize campfire impacts*Respect wildlife*Be considerate of other visitorshttps://lnt.org/why/7-principles/…#6... t.p. flowers and exposed human waste is becoming the norm throughout campsites in Colorado and across America. It's gross and downright unsanitary. Hard to avoid at practically any campsite nowadays. It's truly disgusting and maddening/saddening at the same time. It bears repeating- do not leave your used toilet paper or waste anywhere around the campsite, under rocks, buried in a shallow hole, etc.! Always pack it out. There are waste bags available that do a great job. There are more people camping now than ever before, and places are getting trashed due to such high usage. More can be read at the link above.Edited: 1:43 pm, August 05, 2020 "
And don't think that burning your toilet paper is the solution. One person did that near Fruita a couple of years ago and started a huge fire in a wilderness area. We were getting ready to pack it up and leave since it was moving towards town. https:/…B002L1J4P8
"Very well said!I think that the epidemic has lead more and more people to enjoy the outdoors. While it's great that people want to be outside, some of them are perhaps new to hiking etc and don't know the rules or just don't care about the rules. People need to educate themselves on the proper etiquette.I think overcrowding and mis-use of the land was becoming a larger problem even before Covid. Social media such as Instagram really gets the word out about places and then everyone wants to visit. Some Instagrammers post pictures of themselves doing illegal things in the outdoors and then others either think it's okay or they know it's wrong but don't care and go do that kind of thing too. People also want to try to get the perfect ""Instagram-worthy"" shot and maybe don't even care about being good stewards of the land they are visiting. I have recently decided to stop tagging locations in the photos that I post because I don't want people flocking to some of the quieter places I post about and having them become overrun.It's an interesting topic to discuss and thanks for bringing it up. I'll be following this thread to see what other people think too."
"Yes, I was going to say something about the Instagram/selfie culture too and trails going ""viral."" A lot of times, the Instagram pictures make them look way better than they do in real life anyway since they're taken at sunset/sunrise and use filters. It won't look the same at 3:00 in the afternoon or at a different time of year. And don't pick wildflowers for your photos.Part of me kind of hopes RMNP will consider keeping some sort of reservation system in place after COVID is over since the crowds there are getting out of control and that other really popular places will consider adding them as well like Hanging Lake has done. I haven't been able to go to the Indian Peaks area for a few years now because finding parking there on a weekend is pretty much impossible. I'm worried about all of these places being loved to death and ruined. It's not just tourists but because Colorado's population has grown by 13% in the last 8 years with many of those people moving here solely because they want to recreate in the mountains. I'm not saying Colorado natives should be the only ones allowed to live and hike here but it's frustrating for those who have lived here a long time to all of a sudden not be able to enjoy doing the things we used to because they're now completely overrun with people.This was just on the news this afternoon about people leaving their cardboard signs on 14ers. https://www.9news.com/article/life/style/col…"
"Great list!This is a problem not limited to the backcountry or Colorado, But hopefully people reading this take heed and apply these (as applicable) to any natural area they visit."
Galxe.....so true about the filters and time of day making things look better than they really are! I agree that it might be a good idea if RMNP stays with the reservation system. I think that other national parks should consider it too. Sorry to hear that you aren't able to enjoy places nearby due to them being so busy. That's got to be frustrating.
"""Adding to your point on 3, people you need to mask up when passing people on the trails. Often it's impossible to create enough space. You're either putting someone in danger or eroding the trail.""As a big ""science"" proponent, you understand how the ""experts"" believe the virus to be transmitted, right?"
"“Adding to your point on 3, people you need to mask up when passing people on the trails. Often it's impossible to create enough space. You're either putting someone in danger or eroding the trail.""I’ve heard this from a few people, and there doesn’t appear to be any basis for it. I believe even the CDC’s current position is that masks aren’t necessary outdoors as long as you can generally maintain 6 foot distancing. And the CDC completely exempts heavy aerobic exercise. For both reasons, briefly passing somebody on the trail while hiking wouldn’t require a mask according to our leading health authorities. So I would add another point: If you choose to wear a mask while hiking, that’s fine. But remember that you don’t own the trails and the folks that choose not to hike with masks aren’t necessarily doing anything wrong. So let it go and enjoy your day."
"Good luck keeping 6ft of distance while passing a mob of 10 hikers on a single-track trail. When a trail is 1ft wide, how do you plan to keep 6ft of distance? You can't, so the CDC's recommendation of wearing a mask applies. https:/…cloth-face-cover-guidance.html""Masks are a critical preventive measure and are most essential in times when social distancing is difficult.""Anyone can choose to ignore ""guidelines"" if they want, until they become a law. But don't deny that they exist just cause it doesn't fit what you want to believe."
"Many mountain towns in Colorado are asking people to mask up outside where 6' of distance can't be met, and that's including popular hiking trails. Aspen for example. https:/…The science is there and we are learning more about it every day. The vapor can linger outside. And now scientists are saying a mask also reduces your viral intake by as much as 65%. Meaning, the mask does protect you even if infected by reducing the viral load. The less the dose, the easier it is to recover fro Covid. https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/07/418181/one…"
"I was wearing a mask before they even became cool. When I heard they didn’t look presidential it gave me more reason to wear one. What’s the big deal? Pretty much just common sense, and they still haven’t taken my guns."
"Thanks Gotama for the link. Brad, respectively, in many parts of Colorado if you're passing others on a trail and neglect to mask up you're likely to get a comment."
Gotama: very interesting link about masks reducing viral load. Thanks.
"Getting back to the non coronavirus stuff: thanks powderglut and 618keith. Guess I should've remembered to mention the basics! No matter the weather or distance of hike, I always carry at least a good rain jacket and a spare granola bar + extra liter of water, and a foil blanket is fairly cheap and weighs almost nothing. And fire restrictions, goes without saying. Again, thank you"

"Science is not an opinion. That's like saying you don't believe in gravity. It's true, whether you believe it or not.

"I'll add to number 9. I carry prescription pain meds*, a suture kit, survival blanket, bic lighter, compass, hat, gloves, socks, sunscreen, wipes, zip locks, a deck of cards. Of course food and water. Always, no matter the season, or the distance.FYI, I had a bad mountain bike accident a few years back. I had to hike out with multiple broken bones. A little Vicodin would have helped that day. A deck of cards might seem odd but they get a fair amount of use."

When there is no consensus on the ""science"", it is in fact an opinion. You picked out one scientist and proclaim it to be gospel. There are just as many contrary opinions (see, e,g, CDC guidelines, among many others).And for the record I never called you a racist.

"""Reading comprehension leaves much to be desired on this forum."" I agree. You didn't get the hint in post #19, and kept talking about it. And, in an inflammatory manner. Which led to your post #20 being deleted (again, not by me), Gatama's post about using the word racist, your post #23 which strikes me as being very defensive, and my post #24, with my comment on your use of the word racist + and trying to get back on topic.There was another poster on the CO forums doing something similar, using the word bigot. Especially now, with the protests on the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, please choose your words wisely. Save the terms like bigot and racist for the wretched people who wear it on their sleeve, they aren't hard to find. Not for the people disagreeing with you on this forum.And KAP, if you have anything constructive to add on backcountry rules and etiquette, I'm sure we'll give it consideration"
"SteveB, for the third time now, I did not call anyone a racist. Sadly, I can’t prove it because you or one of the other thought police had my post deleted. And agin, if a topic is raised here, should be fair game to discuss it. Of course if it doesn’t interest you, feel free to move on to another thread."
"KAP, drop it. You could've been construed as implying it.You come across as a lurker, waiting to drop a comment based on ideology. I see you still haven't added anything constructive on the original topic. Would you care to elaborate on your primitive camping experiences in CO? Again, if you have recommendations on that topic, we'll listen. And trying to tell the OP to leave their post? Umm..no"
"Steve, I'm terribly sorry this important topic has been the target of trolling. From the looks of the removed posts, it's TA staff rather than the community that are taking action for a host of reasons including harassment. While it's easy to think someone is sociopathic for using e a global health crisis as an excuse to troll travel forums around the world, stressful times like these can often reveal various dysfunctional and poorly developed coping mechanisms people have for dealing with that stress. Especially now, we should all try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but it's still best to just ignore people spouting nonsense on for attention. Regardless, you have made some wonderful points, and others have added additional bits of important information people don't often consider. The CORSAR card is a must-have, and alli described the contents of my bike/hike bag perfectly. Lately we've been hiking in some really off-the-beaten-path places that are near our home and rarely see anyone, though the mosquitos have been awful. Earlier this summer we hiked a trail near our home that has become extremely popular for a scenic overlook less than a mile from the trailhead. We were on the trail by 5:30am and on our way back down before 9am. Though we saw a handful of people before reaching the overlook, the final half-mile back to the trailhead was swarmed with families and used baby diapers stuffed under rocks and branches along the sides of the trail as well as other litter. Tragic. When we got to the trailhead around 11am, we heard multiple arguments over parking just in the few minute it took to take off boots and change shirts. We've stuck to the off-the-beaten-path ever since. My only additional bit of advice to people new to hiking is that it can be scary encountering strangers when you're alone far out in the middle of the wilderness. In pioneering times, it was often tricky to convey to strangers that you bring well-wishes and diffuse a chance encounter in the wilderness before they might harm you. Thankfully, nowadays it's (usually) easy enough to establish that same rapport by saying, ""hello!"" while pulling up your mask or buff and stepping out of the way."
"SteveB I added my constructive comment, see my first post in this thread."
"Hey LTDreams, you are correct. In this case, best just to ignore, like parsley on the dinner plate. And it'll get this post back on track, and minimize the dead weight posts.I believe I was lucky to get my hiking and primitive camping fix when I did, starting 25 June and leaving CO right before the July 4th weekend stampede. The one benefit (for me) of the statistically poor snowfall over much of the CO Rockies this season was that it allowed trails to dry out earlier than normal. So I got access to some good trails that usually are still iffy late June. And because I did my homework, I actually found a primitive site near an alpine lake where I was alone.. I saw 3 ladies that were finishing their dayhike at the TH, but nobody on the trail, nobody at the lake camping, nobody on the trail back to the TH! Forty five hours alone! Right now that lake has got to have overnight campers galore. I was also able to nab a car camp site in the northern San Juans for two nights, which in late June would usually be too wet to use, but when I was there, it was tinder box dry. I'd guess that site now doesn't go empty more than 15 minutes after one group leavesMaybe one tidbit I can add for a suggestion is: it pays to look at SNOTEL maps periodically, and use that info to follow up with the Ranger Stations"
To your point Steve. In todays local paper.https:/…On my overnight trip we picked up a bag of trash on our way out and saw 3 illegal fires...
"So sad Keith.Adding to my always with me, a whistle. Thought of that while on the river today. Have one on my PFD, All backpacks.Edited: 7:50 pm, August 09, 2020 "
"Great suggestion about contacting district ranger stations for final planning questions. Prior to Covid, we had been planning a month-long camping trip through ID/MT and AB/BC to spend more time in the Bitterroot, Nez-Perce, Lolo, Coer d'Alene, Kootenai, Sawtooth, Salmon-Challis, and Flathead NFs. Although our trip has been postponed by at least a year, our planning info already has contact information for local rangers to get current information about forest fires, forestry road conditions, fire restrictions and other things that can change daily."
"One more item to add: if campfires are allowed, make sure you buy your firewood locally, where you plan to have the campfire. Don't bring firewood from home! (And don't take firewood back home.) It helps control the spread of destructive pests.Reminder, always check for fire restrictions first"
