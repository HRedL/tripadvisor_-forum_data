Scheduled to fly from the US to Nuevo Vallarta on March 26th. Anyone know what's happening? Still safe for travel?
"Nuevo Vallarta is still good.I can’t comment on American cities, taxis, buses, airports or airlines."
Yes
"No cases at all in this area, be overly cautious on the plane. Ie: wiping down things with sanitary wipes. I wouldn’t hesitate to come to the area, actually thinking of staying here longer instead of heading back to Canada."
Heat decreases the virus's life cycle. I have read when temps over 83 degrees or so significantly reduce the visus's life. Seems like temps have been in mid 80s so this should reduce likelihood of getting it in open/outdoor areas. Still need to take precautions in airport/planes. Hand sanitizers and wipes help.
"I am in the elderly class. I am scheduled to arrive in PV on 8 April. At present I have every intention of making the trip. Of course, will be flying in and will attempt to take very precaution in airports and a/c. Will be having a complete checkup with my MD on 3 April.Here is hoping to be on the beach by the 9th."
geord33 - I am sure that I will be there. Check you PMs.
It’s only been identified in Mexico City. We are far safer here than Italy. Come on and have fun.
"we were scheduled to be in Palm Springs now, but they cancelled the tennis tournament....so, we're here now...safest place you could be ....on the beach...plane not crowded, airport with decent lineups, due mostly to lack of personnel than number of tourists, no more traffic going to the north side of the bay...perfection !Edited: 2:34 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"Little mama, My MD said ' ""come on down'!"
Anyone there now: are you noticing less people in the resorts than usual? Lot of cancellations?
chris...i just wrote that the plane wasn't crowded...
"Alberta, Canada has a positive case of coronavirus from someone who returned from an all inclusive on feb 29. Location was undisclosed. So really doesn’t matter if there have been positive cases in the area or not. Bottom line, if you return home and develop any kind of cold or flu symptoms , you should self isolate and call your local health care agency and receive instructions as to how to get tested. And wash you hands...a lot. Just a friendly PSA from an emerg physician who is dealing with this every day."
doctorjohn...more info please....i'm not aware of this case and i'm a doctor too...i doubt location wasn't disclosed...no brainwashing please...
https:/…No brainwashing. Only stating the facts. I can’t tell you if she came from Caribbean side or pacific side as it wasn’t stated. Actually there is probably more than one positive case as a result of travel from Mexico. . As you are a doctor I would assume you receive the daily updates from AHS that I do.
"mucho brainwashing...there's no mention anywhere about an all inclusive , plus there's no mention in the daily updates from ahs about someone who traveled somewhere in mexico only as there is no specific place as it should be...so, until we have a confirmation from a medical authority i just call... sensationalism..."
The Alberta & Quebec provincial governments are asking residents to self isolate for 2 weeks when returning from international travel.
"CathyYou are right. In Alberta, people returning from international travel should self isolate themselves for 14 days. The chief medical officer of Alberta is also recommending Albertans not travel internationally at this time. It’s a recommendation. Not a travel ban."
It would not be a surprise for the other provinces to announce the same in the coming days.
Cathy Oh yeah. In fact BC just announced the same recommendation. Wash your hands...a lot. And stay home if sick whether on vacation or at home.
I have been out of the loop due to illness but at present there are 7 cases only of Covid 19 in the country of Mexico. No panic seen in stores or such as my family in Massachusetts is experiencing.
"Sorry to hear Bezerk. Hope on the mend.Some Provinces in Canada have just advised against any travel anyplace outside of Canada.If you go, you must go into home Insulation for 2 weeks on return.Not good for Families going on spring break"
"I trust, again, that home insulation should read home or self isolation."
"i don't understand how nobody picked up on the nonsense of this self isolation for people coming back to canada, no matter where they come from ...how about airlines employees ?...how about the time between the plane and getting home ?...our public system proves it's mediocrity all over again..."
"Interesting to hear this Joleen. I just spoke to my son who moved back to the states last October and he said it is totally crazy in Massachusetts. Total panic. So different from activity here, where they have experience with serious contagious outbreaks. I am torn on if it is truly warranted or panic is playing into this as well. Obviously need to control this is needed but panic can make it worse. People in Massachusetts were told to stock up for 2 weeks so everyone panicked, hit the stores at once and meyhem has happened including fights. Let alone now all these masses of people in the grocery stores. My husband was sent away from a huge project today as a ruling was passed the other day and no one who has flown can be on site. Yikes."
"There is much hysteria in the states because of the news media showing the wiped out shelves at Costco. We have only a handful of cases in the St. Louis area , yet it can be difficult to find sanitation supplies or at some stores toilet paper. We have tentative plans for travel to PV May 3rd, but are waiting a couple weeks before we commit. Bezerk- Hope you get better soon."
Re:Post #26 - we’ve seen the same thing regarding people buying up large quantities of toilet paper and can’t quite figure it out. Wouldn’t a run on tequila or rum make as much sense?
"look at mexico's approach compared to panic mode approach by canadian state owned medical system...""passengers on international flights arriving in Mexico will be reinforced starting today with questioning and taking a temperature, reported Hugo López Gatell, undersecretary of health.The measure was already applied for flights from China, however, it will be extended to planes that come from a dozen destinations.""Today we are going to scale, as planned from the beginning, the screening, which is this early identification of people who could tend symptoms, through temperature monitoring, and through the interrogation of symptoms, we did this from the beginning because We did it with the flights that came from China. This time it will be more noticeable, because it will be on flights that come from 10 nations with active transmission, ""explained the undersecretary.It may interest you: For the Covid-19 they postpone the Tourist TianguisThe official pointed out that unlike other countries that have closed their borders and restricted flights, the Mexican government will not act in this way.""It is not intended, and I want to make it extremely clear, it is not intended or intended to restrict international travel to Mexico, or to close borders or close seaports.""These measures do not have a solid scientific basis, in the entire history of epidemics there is no scientific demonstration that these extreme measures help reduce the risk of transmission, nor do they help because they have very serious economic and social consequences,"" said López Gatell."
Possibly there is a difference noted as Mexico has been thru epidemics before thus has some experience with these issues and ? less panic.Who knows.
from one panic response to a totally relaxed response...https:/…
"omg The officials making the decisions here are not 'panicked'- the only people panicking are the eejits buying up all the TP and hand sanitizer because they are reading Facebook memes and comments on sites like this one instead of reliable sources.The gov't and most companies are instigating and advising very rational and common sense precautions to attempt to curb the spread in order to stop the entire system from collapsing. If even a small percentage of our population becomes sick, and ten percent of those cases are severe- the strain on our healthcare system would be severe and many MORE people will die needlessly as they will have to resort to triage. We have a system that is at 120% capacity in some areas already. If you say 'so what, they are old and sickly anyway'- then you are cold and heartless. We are talking about people's parents and grandparents and spouses here. and anyone who believes Mexico is usually honest about reporting anything, or that the country wouldn't try to hide or minimize things for economic or PR reasons- I gotta ask, how much of your experience in Mexico has really sunk in? Keep those tourists coming as much as possible, no problem here, nothing to see, smile and wave....come on"
rissask...did you read the link about the dentist?
British Columbia has a confirmed Covid case from a traveller that recently returned from Mexico. Alberta also has one case from Mexico. It's out there folks.
"snorkeler...where in mexico...it's a big country, 127 milion people...i don't think it's fair to post such general info ..."
"The US Department of state has issued a travel advisory that is global, advising citizens not to travel internationally. Here is a direct quote, where you see that it covers all countries and provides the grounds for why travelers should avoid all nonessential travel abroad:The Department of State advises U.S. citizens to reconsider travel abroad due to the global impact of COVID-19. Many areas throughout the world are now experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks and taking action that may limit traveler mobility, including quarantines and border restrictions. Even countries, jurisdictions, or areas where cases have not been reported may restrict travel without notice.https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/t…"
"I believe the Canadian government has issued a similar advisory that covers all international nonessential travel and thus also applies to Mexico:  https://www.narcity.com/news/ca/canada-trave…Edited: 10:32 am, March 14, 2020 "
"John, looking forward to seeing you and your bride.Edited: 10:49 am, March 14, 2020 "
"this is the same type of knee jerk reaction and panic as the people who go to the stores and panic buy stuff...great attitude , great example..."
Rush on toilet paper.https:/…2020.htmlEast coast has confirmed cases.
"Rissak..I have to add, I believe all governments might ""fib"" somewhat in this matter. There sadly is corruption in every government. :(We now have 2 confirmed cases in Guadalajara, both traveled out of country, both are isolated. Jaliso and Chapala are going into proactive, precautionary measures. Some schools closing and other measures to begin as they have done quickly in other epidemic viruses. Airports in GDL and ? PV to do health checks via laser temps. Mexico has been very successful in the past in quick containment. Now if we can keep panic in control. I have to laugh at the hoarding of TP. Totally irrational. Pam Thompson in Puerto Vallarta is giving great updates. I have been socially isolated due to flu, and will not go out until I am 100% and than only for essential things, bill paying, bank etc. At least for a bit. My May travel plans today remain..time will tell what happens. Be well all, avoid panic and let's hope for warm weather and containment before all financial structures crumble.Edited: 5:41 pm, March 14, 2020 "
I wouldn’t recommend taking the chance on leaving the country. I would suggest you cancel and wait until the virus is controlled.Husband and I are shorting our stay in Nuevo and returning to Canada due to the virus. Air Transat is so busy that we may have to wait 2 days before they will return our call so we can rebook.Our resort is becoming a ghost town. Last week it was extremely busy and noisy. My biggest fear is the government stopping all international flights.
"@Luvthesun100, I think your fear is totally rational. I would be very surprised at anyone that would choose to leave Canada right now! Who knows whether you'll be allowed back in as the feds are already hinting that commercial transport may be stopped and for Canadians to return home asap."
hiare u still planning on going to pv
"gillian0911Who are you asking if they plan to go to PV? I doubt if you were asking me, but I still have plans to go"
"Just left Puerto Vallarta and all was very calm there. However I did just see a post asking for people to cancel plans on coming to Puerto Vallarta from a news source in Puerto Vallarta.Not sure if this is like the US and they are just being cautious or what. The workers at the Airport handling foods all had masks on, again a cautious measure in my opinion. We were also told that the normal school vacation for Easter break for the children in Mexico will be extended by two weeks. They will now be off for an entire month.Also they had two people at a table with a big billboard to discuss the Virus. We were not screened in Mexico nor on our return to the US.The only big thing that changed is EVERYONE was wiping down the surfaces on the plane where they were sitting. TSA is also allowing 12 Ounces of hand Sanitizer in your carryon"
"Westjet will not be flying outside of Canada after this Sunday, so everyone should be aware of that. This was just announced tonight."
"Anyone still planning on going to Mexico Now is just so inconsiderate I. Please people, just stay home.the people that are so self-absorbed they cannot look into the future and read the warnings and have no compassion for others.Laura is correct.Canada airlines are stopping flights down to Mexico now.Sue glad you got home safely."
"Regular Westjet flights after Sunday are cancelled so that they can concentrate using those planes to get Canadians home. You should be registered with the “Canadians abroad” website. If you have a Westjet return flight booked home, they will be contacting you."
"I have been in PV area for three months and departing tomorrow which was our original date to come back to U.S. It appears very safe to be here and there is no panic like the U.S. However, the situation could change here if people don’t abide by the mandates and guidelines to support containing the virus. We are .. all .. being asked not to travel unnecessarily. I feel badly for the hotel, store and restaurant owners as it has gotten very quiet here the last few days..but we all must understand the risks of traveling and possibly spreading the virus."
"Traveling anywhere right now, even to a restaurant can be risky worldwide. Things are evolving in Mexico, cancellations, closures etc. So the answer rests in you only. :("
No confirmed Covid19 cases in Nayarit. Check with the US embassy for data. We are fine and well.
"lm is not informed, don't listen to his/her advice."
"Heard on the news yesterday, Mexico has over 100 cases and 1 death. These numbers have increased since we departed on March 15th. This information was provided by the Mexican GovernmentWith testing results that take 5 days no matter where you live in the US, Canada or Mexico all numbers will increase."
Have canceled my trip planned for early April. I am going to try for June. My thinking is that if an international handle is not found for this virus by 1 June the world will be in financial chaos and there may not be even airlines in business to fly anywhere.
"Anyone traveling for pleasure now is just plain Inconsiderate of others, when Country's are telling you Not to travel Now."
US has just closed the Border to Mexico! This is for tourism only! This was a Mutual agreement just like Canada and the US did!
Sue C..results of testing in Guadalajara area of Mexico turn around in 24 hours not days. Stay home...many in Mexico are social distancing and trying to keep curve low.
Bezerk very interesting since my son was just tested in the US and was told 5 days. May be our back log but results are not instant. His influenza test was only a few hours.
"Likely back log. I guess.Although I have found with 10 years experience as a patient in Mexico, results have always been quicker for me than my friends in states, who knows why."
"I think the reason that results in Mexico and some other forward thinking countries is that the medical field is free to do as best they can and not be hampered by too many rules, regulations, politicians, public opinion ,etc that medical personnel are weighed by in the US"
You are correct calmjohn..I hesitated to say such words being a resident here and thus folks thinking I might be bias. ;)
Did you go? What's it like at Paradise Village?
Post #63 - Read Post #57.
"# 63 First I agree with Larry T. Seeing that this is your first post we will be glad to answer any questions that you may have if you ask them in a manner that we understand. We were speaking of medical and you asked ""Did you go?"" Also what did you mean by what is it like in Paradise Village."" Did that question pertain to residents or tourists as there should have been no tourists.Glad to have you on board, just be a little more specific."
"Larry T., #64, was responding to me, #63. I said ""Did you go?"" This was as a question to the original statement, #0, who said (s)he was going to go to PV anyway. I asked my question not knowing that there were so many postings. Reading through them all makes a good story. I just checked with Interval Inernational and the agent said that if I wanted to do an exchange cancellation, that I would lose the $178 exchange fee AND the week. Painful. And helpless since I can't do anything about it."
"I hear you on Interval, I have one vacation thru them and two thur RCI not thrilled with their cancellation policies at all."
"As you probably know, II has allowed some leeway for those who have a start date at a resort before April 30th. I have heard that they wil be addressing the month of May soon. I will be watching for that and will report back here if they do,"
"Post #66 - Your Post #63 (dated April 2nd) was asked of the OP, who said they were travelling on March 26th. This would be after the border closing of March 20th, pointed out by Post #57. You don’t see any redundancy there?"
If people start hoarding coffee and I can't get any watch out ! The results could be disastrous!!!!!
Coffee and or alcohol joarding could be bad. Some issues being stated of decrease in alcohol production in Mexico.
"That's right, bezerk. Grupo Modelo, which produces Pacifico, Corona, Modelo, Victoria, Bud Light plus others, is stopping production as of tomorrow (Sunday) due to government regulations. I don't know about other breweries but I assume it will be the same."
"yes Harry, I knew but did not want to create total Panic.. Hoard now, I did hear there would be no dry law but things change. Yes it is me despite no typo. lol. Which will everyone take coffee or alcohol? I am coffee."
"Yeah right, try telling that to Thailand or India. COVID 19 having no problem surviving or spreading in that heat."
"India has seen 1,154 deaths out of 1.3 billion people.Thailand has seen 54 deaths.Not exactly NYC or Wuhan levels."
"JMHO, but I think it is sunlight, UV rays, and body total Vit. D helping those in hot climates, not heat per se."
"Were you able to reschedule your trip for a later date? Did you get airline tickets refunded? We planned June 26 - Jul 3 but the resort is not opening and we are not comfortable traveling now. Just wondering what others are doing in similar situation.Thanks, Jerry"
