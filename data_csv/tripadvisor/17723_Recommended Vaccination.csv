"Hi everyone, I am coming to Germany in February and would like to ask, what kind of vaccination would be recommended to take the trip, or just common vaccination, would do. Thank you!"
Bit early for 1 April.
"What is a common vaccination? That also depends on where you live which you fail to mention. In winter there are often flu epidemics. Tick born encephalitis, a disease only found in certains parts of continental Europe, is not a problem in February."
"Hi detbo,I am spending a few months in Stuttgart. Will be travelling around for sight seeing a bit. I think common vaccination is to prevent food poisoning and flu, so I was checking if there is an area specific vaccination that would be useful. It would be great have any suggestions. Thank you!"
"Nothing out of the ordinary. Tetanus would be good. In some parts of Germany, there is rabies, so if you get bitten by a wild animal (never happened to me in over 40 years), definitely consult a doctor. A vaccination is not recommended though, because of the side effects. Some get TBE vaccination (agains ticks), but I wouldn't get this one either. Again, because of the side effects.If you get bitten by a tick, remove it quickly, then watch that spot over a couple of days. If red rings form around the spot, consult a doctor, you need antibiotic treatment - this is an early sign of Lyme disease, agains which there is no vaccination. All in all, I wouldn't worry."
"Whatever you do, bring your malaria pills!No, to be serious. nothing out of the ordinary. If you tend to be hysteric about ticks get a vaccination against TBE in case you are spending time south of the River Main and plan to spend a lot of time in the nature."
