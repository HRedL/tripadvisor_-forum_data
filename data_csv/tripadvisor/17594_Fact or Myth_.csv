"Is the house of the rising sun a ""real"" place in NOLA or just a myth? I bet this question comes up alot, but just thought about it now and wanted some opinions and/or truths...."
It is said to be the Villa Convento on Ursulines. Calling Dr. Rodent to answer this one.
"Funny story-this happened 2 years ago at Flokfest. My husband and I were staying at the Villa Convento, and I spent the afternoon with the Flok on a bar crawl. He doesn't drink, so he chose to spend that time at Harrah's at the craps table. He didn't have his cell phone, so when he started to leave-he couldn't remember the name of our hotel. He asked security at Harrah's (they tried to call me but I didn't hear the ring), and finally he said ""it is known as the house of the rising sun."". They all said-Villa Convento!!! Then gave him directions and he walked back. So I started walking back and checked my phone and found several missed calls from Harrah's security. My heart sank-I just knew he was in the hospital with some kind of emergency. I called them, and they relayed the story of what happened. So I just waited out on our balcony to see him slinking home with his tail between his legs. We still laugh about it!"
Oh Rodent!
"That is too funny!!! Love it, but thank god he was ok :)"
"Hey, Poole, you missed the part of the story where he was telling them (the Harrah's security) that he was to meet some people at the Funky Monkey (meaning Funky Pirate). :-D Gotta love Poole and Mr Poole. :-DAs for the story - when guests ask me about it, I am honest with them and tell them that there are several places claiming that distinction, the VC among them and really, so many years have passed that I don't think we will ever know. The song itself is kind of vague about what exactly ""house of the rising sun"" is anyway, most say it was a brothel, but some say it was a prison. The VC definitely used to be the former at some point, this much has been historically documented. One of our ghosts is supposed to be a Madam."
This is such a cool thread since this is where I am staying! Love the story poole that is priceless.
"I googled where is the house of the rising sun, and many sites popped up, interesting reading some of them."
"Latest research indicates that there was no House of the Rising Sun as a brothel.Recent evidence suggests that a hotel on Conti, known as the Rising Sun which burned to the ground in 1822 may have been a house of prostitution and excavations in 2005 revealed many small containers of rouge and cosmetics. There are two other sites which reveal evidence of being brothels, one being the Rising Sun Hall on Cherokee Street in the Carrollton Street area, which no longer exists. The third possibility was the Rising Sun Restaurant, formerly in the 100 block of Decatur, in the 1860's.It is safe to say that the Villa Convento was not the House of the Rising Sun, and no other building can lay credible claim to that name.A close reading or listening of the lyrics of the song reveals nothing to indicate that the House of the Rising Sun was even a brothel. Some interpret the lyrics as suggesting either a gambling hall or a jail."
"And, as much as I love the Animals version, the song has a long history dating back to at least 1934, and possibly before. Artists who recorded or sang it included Woody Guthrie, Josh White and even Bob Dylan in 1961, a few years before the Animals recording..…wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_of_the_Rising_…I think i recall that the location had been narrowed down to at least six places, including, if I remember correctly, somewhere in Algiers, as well.Kudos to Rodent for an honest answer, and not one to strictly credit the VC.Edited: 6 years ago "
"Kjosker, what you're saying is what Wikipedia says, only they phrased it ""Only three candidates that use the name Rising Sun have historical evidence"" (that's the three you mentioned, note that all have ""Rising Sun"" in the name). It doesn't mention ones that do NOT use the name Rising Sun and refers to places that do have these words as part of the name. At least that's how I'm understanding it.In other words: nobody knows. :)"
My money's still on Villa Convento...just because! :)
"Rodent, you are correct. Nobody knows. I like the jail suggestion. Regarding the VC, it probably was a brothel at some point. What the name was is not known. What is known is that New Orleans and sex went together like a hand and glove. Even before Storyville. When the Navy tore down Storyville, they didn't incarcerate the working girls, they just moved underground, many in the Quarter, and just about everywhere else in NO, hence the many claims of being a former brothel. Getting back to New Orleans and sex, in my lifetime, Bourbon Street was more sex oriented, but it faded through the years, as it has everywhere. Why? I suggest it was the VCR and eventually the internet. No need to go out in public and spend a fortune when you can stay at home and spend a fortune."
"Well, the Villa Convento may or may not be the House of the Rising Sun, but it does have a history with Jimmy Buffett, which is almost as good!"
Got sure it's been the ruin of many a poor boy.
"""God I know I'm one!"" Great thread!There is The House Of The Rising Sun B&B in Algiers Point on Pelican...but my money is still on The Convento! So excited about staying there in only 64 days!!!!!!!!!"
"Thanks for all this great info. I would be curious to see what the tour groups say about this topic to their participants. I like that the VC is honest on their website, only saying that it is the rumored site of ""The House of the Rising Sun."" I would love to see the documentary that Jimmy Buffet filmed while living there. That must be very interesting!"
"A number of tour groups stop by the hotel, mainly ghost tours. There is one lady that I've heard who always mentions the House of the Rising Sun and sings part of the song to her group, then talks about the ghosts--the part of her story I heard mentioned a madam from its brothel days and several small children from when it was a residence. My husband heard part of a tour saying that large parts of street were lined with bodies during an epidemic and that what is now our carriageway was once a makeshift morgue during that same epidemic, but I haven't heard this anywhere else."
"In addition to those, we also have a ghost of a guy who killed himself in one of the rooms (when they were apartments before it became a hotel in the 1980's). The room where this happened is supposed to be our most haunted one. I've heard a recording made by a spirit hunter in that room and then played slowed down. It was very staticky and it's easy to hear/imagine things you want to hear when you're not sure what exactly you are hearing, but the staticky sound could be interpreted as a voice saying ""Get out"".There was also a family (one of the first owners) who all dropped dead after a dinner, but I don't usually see them mentioned as ghosts, so they may be off duty."
"wow, these stories are crazy, but cool. I was reading the reviews for the hotel and it looks like a recent guest had quite the haunted experience there. Makes me want to stay there now, too bad I already booked elsewhere :("
"amvm, the room that that guest (who wrote the review) stayed in was the ""Get out"" room I mentioned, 209.I read that review as well, and whereas some of the stuff (lipstick placed here but found there) was so detailed that I wasn't sure what was going on, the one about the towel moving on the shower rod (with no breeze) did sound a bit creepy."
I thought the towels were creepy too. Wild that it is the same room that you heard the evp recording.Now I really want to visit the VC even if we can't stay there!
"And the song right now at The Funky Pirate is, you guessed it, House of the Rising Sun"
Rodent next time we are in NOLA Ger and I will have to get that room!
"LOL, nann....you WANT that room???? ooh...I see one of the Flok will HAVE that room! Maybe a séance??Edited: 6 years ago "
The ghost of Vince Lombardi will show up in a Saints jersey. DOH! Who Dat?
Vince will get you for that when you two finally meet...
Ill probably have to run the steps at Lambeau eating a brat with no mustard.
