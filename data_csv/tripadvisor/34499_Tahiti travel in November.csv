"My husband and I have been planning our 10 wedding anniversary/honeymoon to Tahiti for over a year now. We are currently booked to depart Sept 9-22. With COVID we are debating postponing until November, but I know this is the beginning of their rainy season. Can any shed some light on their experience traveling in November?"
September should most likely be drier and less humid than November but not sure where things will stand by thenWe have been to Bora Bora in early November and the weather was beautiful but more humid than other trips. We are booked to go Nov 10 this time as our month long trip leaving today was canceled and there were few dates we could rebook for an airline ticket at a comparable price.
We were there the first week of November 2019. We stayed 3 nights in Moorea and 5 nights in Bora Bora. 1 day of rain in Moorea and 1 1/2 day of rain in Bora Bora. The other days were glorious!!!
"We are currently booked for Nov. as well. At this point, I would be thrilled to sit in our bungalow listening to the rain on the roof compared to the prospect of cancelling the trip altogether!"
"We were already scheduled for November so haven't changed our plans yet. I'm still wondering if travel will really even be ready by then but I'm holding out hope. However, I would consider looking soon. I feel like most people i have seen reschedule have moved their dates to November. I wouldn't be surprised if places are getting full already for then. Not sure though. Ours is booked early November and our travel agent really recommended it. He said he would be more worried about rain getting further into December and of course like January and Feb. Good luck!"
"Early November is generally nice. A bit more humid than Sept., but not bad. However, November will be when the Coronavirus probably returns. You will not want to be traveling during this period. Until an effective vaccine is developed and deployed I would not consider traveling anywhere. This virus is not SARS or MERS. It is not going away. It will be with us all year round. Hopefully a vaccine that eradicates, like the polio vaccine is created, not just one like for the flu that just mitigates."
Very true!!!!! Although travel in November doesn't even seem possible. Likely not again until 2021 from Canada at least :(
Rangi-You should just go on every thread and tell every traveler to cancel their plans till 2021. Do you like disheartening everyone? You dont know so just stop.
"Andrew F, you don’t like the new reality? No one is forcing you to read my posts . There will be no tourism in F P this year. Probably not until a vaccine is ready for mass deployment so just get use to it."
You dont know that. Just like if I kept telling posters dont worry you can travel in July.
I agree Andrew as Rangi 1 is chiming on topics they know nothing about like Custom Tahiti.it was a US company with top rating from Better Business Bureau.In my belief the forum is to give helpful info if you know about the subject. It is an ask and share place
He has posted helpful information but for him to blanket say no tourism for 2020 is not accurate. Its guessing at best. If FP comes out officially and says it then fine.
"It sure the hell is accurate. Only the most blind cannot see tourism in FP is not going to happen the rest of this year at least. As for Custom Tahiti It looks like I was mistaken, it seems they were an American operator.Edited: 11:00 pm, May 02, 2020 "
"Containment measures will be reduced April 27Containment measures will be reduced with an observation period until May 13:Gradual return of the lifestyle on Tahiti and Moorea.Return of administrative life by favoring telework.Return to education from May 18 very graduallyReopening of shops.Wearing a mask is strongly recommended in public spaces and at work.Gatherings on the public highway prohibitedMaintaining the curfew from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.Bars and nightclubs remain closed as well as performance halls, weights rooms, and team sports centers.Abandonment of the certificate during the day, outside of curfew hoursAuthorization of sports and nautical activities.Beaches reopen without large gatheringsReligious services for less than 50 peopleThings are moving forward.There is mention of testing prior to flying to allow entry."
"Update...One step at a time and lets all hope for the best for all of us.Tahitians can now purchase beer Monday thru Thursday between 8am-4pm.Curfew is still in place 9pm to 5am.Restrictions have been eased of social travel between Tahiti and Moorea, with strong emphasis on wearing masks in public and social distancing by authorities.Progress is slow yet lets hope it will continue in an orderly and safe progression."
"Until it is announced by FP you can NOT say for certain will be closed for the remainder of 2020. END STOP. You can highly suspect it, you can feel certain in your own assumption but that doesn't magically make it fact. Sorry Rangi1 I agree with them here and your comments have been very frustrating. It's very easy to simply say ""I don't see how it's possible"" or ""It's VERY unlikey"" or anything of that sort, but you are not a FP government official nor has it been announced that way so please stop making statements as though it is fact. While I do think you will end up being correct, I do think it's unlikely tourism will be open, especially for those in the US we don't know for sure and things seem to change weekly if not daily.Also, some added food for thought:""The French Polynesian government has outlined new conditions for people entering the territory as rotations of French public servants are being prepared.The government decided that people who had tested positive for Covid-19 must be free of symptoms for at least two weeks before boarding a flight for Tahiti.It said on departure they must produce a medical certificate confirming their health status which is less than three days old.On arrival such passengers won't need to isolate.All other travellers, however, must isolate for two weeks.""Source:https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-…"
"According to the Cruise Industry News, Windstar just announced that they will be resuming cruises in French Polynesia September 3rd. I don't know if that's a reasonable expectation or not. I currently have a cruise scheduled with them from Tahiti for the end of September, but I'm not holding my breath, and I'm exploring my options for postponing for a year.https://www.cruiseindustrynews.com/cruise-ne…"
They are talking about resuming international flights in June.https:/…
"rangil:How do you know that? I have been getting updates from Tahiti Tourisme and things are getting better.Who knows when they will open for outside visitors though. The last I read FP had 60 confirmed cases with 0 deaths and all 60 recovered already. I realize they don't want people coming there who are sick or who could give it to their people. Perhaps they could have people take antibody tests before coming?Edited: 10:30 pm, May 21, 2020 "
"None of us know what the plans for reopening Tahiti to travelers will be. They are fortunate that it appears that there is no COVID in the islands and the challenge is what steps can be taken to keep it that way. Unfortunately no screening or tests are foolproof. The antibody test, depending upon which one is used, is anywhere from 60% accurate to 95% accurate. All the test tells you is that you had the disease. There is no science yet as to how long the antibodies protect someone from getting the disease again. In NY the general population is showing that 12% have antibodies. I'm not how that helps determine when to allow tourists.Things like screening for fever and respiratory complaints will not work as many who have COVID are asymptomatic. The reality is that it will be a gamble to reopen but I understand all areas need to in order to survive. Vacationing with a mask on whenever out of a hotel room is not conducive to a great vacation. Obviously you can't wear a mask at a restaurant. In a perfect world COVID would disappear 100% and then we are all safe to go about our normal activities.Stay safe out there."
"Always appreciate the logic and reasonable explanations from medic.....I agree, going to FP in a mask and gloves for visitors, the crew on the PG and hotels can not be fun ..Sad reality"
"""They are talking about resuming international flights in June.""I believe that article says that they hope make an announcement by June, and that the airlines need one month notice to resume flights (so July at earliest) (?)."
"As of today all international flights from Air Tahiti Nui are cancelled through the end of June. Obviously unknown if they will resume on July 1 and if they do nobody knows what the ""rules"" will be to fly."
I am really hoping they resume flights July 1st. Fingerscrossed!!!  I am happy to fly with a mask. I am happy to social distance while there. It is actually easier to stay away from crowds in Tahiti than it is at the grocery store or anywhere where I live.
"Medic - here in northern California they are starting to reopen some things but staying 6 feet apart in restaurants, etc. I guess depending on where one is staying in FP and what type of room they have it could prove to be difficult to stay 6 feet apart. The rooms we have booked would make it quite easy to stay 6 feet apart. If they put tables 6 feet apart, perhaps restaurants could work? It is all tricky for sure. My boss had Covid-19 and had two negative tests prior to his positive test so the tests definitely are not always accurate. I wear a mask whenever I am going to the grocery store or hardware store (the only two place I go). The scariest part for me would probably be the airplane ride to Tahiti. Sitting on our balcony and swimming off the deck sounds wonderful to me right now!! I am hoping EVERYONE has learned to wash their hands. It was shocking to find out how many people didn't wash their hands prior."
"While on our October trip to FP, amongst everything else I would be concerned about the ability to leave FP if necessary and what would lie ahead when we arrive back at SFO..."
"I read about what Iceland is going to try, and wonder if French Polynesia would would consider something similar. Apparently the plan for Iceland is to open their boarders on June 15th. They will offer all incoming people a free coronavirus test. Test negative, and go forward and enjoy your vacation. Test positive, and into isolation. I'm not sure what all the logistics of it would be. But it's at least some measure of protection while trying to get things moving again. I don't know how many countires would have enough tests to offer that at their airports though."
"If FP reopens in July it will be a huge mistake. What has happened every time a country relaxes their restrictions? They see a significant spike and close back down. France this week closed 70 schools, some of which were open for one day. I have been hearing from friends in Tahiti that the other islands do not want people from Tahiti visiting...even less for foreigners. Hopefully they do not make the mistake of opening up for tourism."
"Yes! Last year I visited Tahiti with my wife through Tahiti Surf Beach Paradise. We enjoyed in Tahiti a lot, visited some beautiful places like Faarumai Waterfalls, Huahine Natural Aquarium, Museum in the Polynesian heritage, etc. The honeymoon went superb there and would never forget those romantic moments I spent there with my wife. But due to COVID-19 I not know about the rules of Tahiti. You should obey the guidelines of that country. Don't panic enjoy yourself."
"Your true colors are showing, Rangi.Rather than be an agnostic observer of an opinion that FP wont open this year, you proved you are opposed to it.Keep drinking the koolaid, bud."
"Yes, I am opposed to FP allowing tourists in if it means the virus gets in and infects people. Why would anyone want this new virus to spread through the islands? Only people who do not love FP or have friends there would think it is a good idea at this point in ime. Those are my true colors, Andrew. What are yours? All one has to do is look at what happens when countries reopen. Infections rise and they close down again.Edited: 12:25 pm, May 27, 2020 "
"Incorrect.And nobody ""wants"" the virus to spread.Life is a risk. Outside of a very few areas where it was grossly mismanaged, the risk is minimal."
RangilWhat about the tahitians that dont have income from tourism? Or the ones that lost businesses? The tahitians who are suffer depression because there is zero income and suicides that accompany it?You are ok with above for keeping the borders closed?France nor the U.S. can give out money and support forever.

"Actually the death rate in the U.S. is somewhere around .03% of population. Take NYC and everyone aged 80+ out of those figures, and it is closer to .01%. Take out anyone with other pre-existing conditions and the number approaches 0.Not minimizing the deaths or the potential seriousness of the disease.

And where do you get these figures? CDC? Johns Hopkins? The morality rate among overall population is meaningless given we have no idea who is actually infected.

"Get your stuff straight Andrew. Those are not CDC numbers and I was asking if he was getting his figures from a reputable source. I do believe in the CDC figures and what he posted are not CDC numbers.Edited: 9:34 pm, May 31, 2020 "
"Even grossly-inflated CDC numbers are less than 100,000 deaths (total). Do the math."
And now scientists are saying being outdoors is better than indoors. Go figure. Oh and the quiet release from the CDC that covid doesnt really live on surfaces as long as they thought.What better place to be outside than the beach floating on raft or snorkeling. Wonder what place is this?
"Earlier discussion was overall death rate. As for infection fatality rate, here you go, the latest from the CDC:https:/…planning-scenarios.htmlInfection fatality rate of 0.4%. Even lower if you factor in asymptomatic case estimates. That's all ages, all cases. Back out the nursing home deaths and comorbidities and the average person is more likely to die in an auto accident than of COVID."
Thanks for info KAP I’m sure rangi1 will have a problem with this info

"Can we please get back to discussing FP and enough with the back and forth? NONE of you are experts in the field and clearly don't have a good understanding about how the risk has nothing to do with the mortality rate but the INFECTION RATE! This is not the place for these discussions. So how about we quit arguing about things we have zero control over. FP will open its borders to tourists when they believe it is most appropriate based on their own risk-based analysis. All we can do is wait and dream of the day we all get to go again. Whether that is later this year, next year, 2022 or even later! We don't know as we are not part of the WHO nor part of the FP government. So let's just keep our opinions to ourselves and get back to talking about these beautiful islands."
"Let me scold you, but then get in the last word.Unfortunately the two are inextricably tied, as there will be no FP travel to discuss if the current restrictions are not relaxed."
"KAP:""Let me scold you, but then get in the last word.""Was this aimed at me? Because I wasn't even involved in all of craziness back and forth with you guys. My point is you all are being ridiculous. You aren't just discussing restrictions, you are all discussing your opinions on the numbers, and blah blah blah. What's the point? It doesn't belong here. Discussion on restrictions wouldn't include whether you do or don't deem them justified, just that they are in place and how we are all adapting to them. That's it. I prefer to enjoy these forums as conversations and sharing tips, experiences, etc. To talk about our dreams for when we can travel again. Focus on the islands, focus on the travel, quit bringing all this nonsense into the conversation. It doesn't help anyone, it just takes away from the discussions and there is ZERO value as none of you are providing facts, just opinions and attacks. Discussion on FP travel is not limited by the restrictions unless you choose to restrict yourself. I'm still having discussions and planning, you know the only thing that has changed? Is not know the exact dates when my next trip will be. Thankfully that date isn't needed for me to still participate and enjoy these forums. I had plans for November, hopefully I can go November of next year. We'll see what happens. In the meantime I'm enjoying looking at the restaurants, the weather to expect around that time, places that are or hopefully will be open. I monitor the restrictions but know that anything said here is meaningless. I'll get my info from FP as they come out with official press releases. Speculation and ridiculous debates are pointless. I'm asking you all to stop the silly debates and instead, focus on the point of these forums, especially this thread, to discuss travel to FP during the month of November, whether 2020, 2021, or 2029 if needed. That's all this should be about. I truly don't care about any ""last word"". You want it? go for it, but once your done will you please let it be so the rest of us can continue on with more positive discussions that add value? Thanks!"

Rangi1: I sure hope you are wrong!
"Andrew, My point was the danger discussed by the international experts has to do with the infection rate. That is what correlates directly with the danger (thus the flattening of the curve) and that the mortality rate of COVID19 first off isn't clear as testing has been very poor and really doesn't relate to the true danger of the virus. That a virus can actually have a lower mortality rate and still end up causing more deaths. This is because it will cause deaths indirectly, such as filling up an ER because everyone got sick all at the same time so others needing emergency care might not be able to access them. That's all I was saying. I wasn't going into the specific details, the data, the breakdown, anything else. Me saying ""Craziness"" has to do with the back and forth of people who are not experts trying to discuss this as though they are. That's all. In a forum that was not set up and thread not designed to discuss it. You are all very off topic on this thread. Feel free to attack on me all you want if it makes you feel better. There are soooo many places to yell into the void about COVID19 and to discuss your own interpretations, etc. However, it really doesn't matter because none of us are in charge of when or how FP will open up. It would just be nice to be able to come to these forums and have the conversation focused on the main topic rather than continually going to arguments back and forth about COVID19 and usually what ends up turning into politics. I'm in the US it's the only thing I hear about anymore. it would be nice if a topic about the weather and such in November in Tahiti, was just about that. If anything, could you just create a COVID19 specific thread and do all the arguing over there? So the rest of us can focus on the actual thread topics? Considering I hope whenever I am able to travel to Bora Bora our plan is to go in November. So I enjoy hearing about people's experiences of Tahiti and Bora Bora in November. But once people get so aggressively off-topic others quit responding to the actual topic of the thread. My intent was less about attacking you guys individually, I apologize for that, more of just hoping we could get this back on topic. So I apologize if I insulted anyone and for my initial harsh words. I just would love to get this back on topic and leave the COVID19 for other threads. <3I don't feel it's an unreasonable request or hope."
"Because I disagree with you its now considered attack.Michelle, please point out where I called you names or disparaged you. This is whats wrong today. You have a differing opinion and its now called microaggression."
"Andrew, I didn't say that you called me any names. I said ""Feel free to attack on me all you want if it makes you feel better."" not to say that you were already attacking me but that if you wanted to respond with aggression rather than being reasonable as your initial comment was you being on the offense. What is wrong is that I just gave calm and logical feedback on why I was saying what I said and rather than addressing anything important you just hung on to one little thing and went off on that. I don't understand people at all. I was trying to be reasonable, I even apologized for coming off as I was trying to attack you when it wasn't my intent. Are you wanting to argue just to argue? I'm actually trying to be civil here so why are you intent on being like this?"
"Perhaps we come from very different backgrounds. While my language is direct and assertive, it does not mean I am rude, boorish or anything else.My point was that there is a large majority claiming that we should stay home, shut things down till we are safe. Who knows when we are safe? So we are going to cause financial wreckage to the small percentage who are at risk with this virus? Its asinine.The Intercontinental Moorea closed down forever. Think about that. The interconinental is not a mom/pop organization.If they have problems, imagine Joe Schmoe tahitian. Its ridiculous.My 2 cents...Edited: 7:42 pm, June 01, 2020 "
"Andrew..please..take a step back and either stay on topic or please move on...I asked nicely here...we all know the dangers, we all know the risks, we all know what our government’s are doing, especially ours, but take it over to Facebook, or? Travel discussions , yes with all its warts and all right now, not politics, public opinion, or lack of it"
"Andrew, your comments are rude ] for completely ignoring the only main points I was bringing up. Which you are continuing to do now still. You are discussing points I'm not interested in discussing with you. You are clearly only interested in arguing and have no interest in actually hearing anything else I have written about. That in and of itself is rude. Not once have I even told you my opinions on any of this but you keep talking as though you are proving a point, the problem is we aren't interested in your point. You are off-topic. Please get back to discussing the topic at hand: Tahiti in November."
"Andrew, I appreciate your posts on the matter.Some people just don't like to hear a dissenting or unpopular opinion. So rather than commenting on the topic, or god forbid just moving on to another thread, they attempt to stifle the discussion. Ignore it.Edited: 11:48 am, June 02, 2020 "
"KAP Andrew...Or you could stay on topic here in a travel forum. Really, you are that dense and need to as you said control the narrative..this is a travel forumEdited: 1:01 pm, June 02, 2020 "
"KAP, you are being ridiculous. You both are purposefully ignoring all my points in my posts. This isn't about dissenting or unpopular opinions. In fact, I haven't even given my thoughts and opinions on what either of you are saying. I am here because I want to be discussing travel in November. I actually have a reason to be in this thread. Your commentary and opinions on the COVID19 situation do not belong on here. Obviously Tripadvisor agrees as the posts that are off topic in this thread are being removed.How about, god forbid, you stay on topic or go to a different thread. Your discussion is not welcome in this thread as it is completely off topic. Create your own thread with COVID19 as the topic and have an open discussion to your hearts content. Don't suddenly pretend like you are the victim and being stifled just because you are trying to have a ""discussion"" that is 100% off topic. Please move your topic to another thread, share all your views there and leave this one to be back to discussing weather and travel to Tahiti in November. Heck, you and Andrew can discuss in private messages all you want as well. I'm not arguing with you about your chosen topic, I'm telling you that it is not needed to be discussed in this thread. If you can't understand that simple request I don't know what to tell you. It's pretty basic, this thread has a topic, you and Andrew are not discussing it, thus it's not needed on here. As for ON TOPIC content, because that's what I would really be interested in, is that it sounds like Tahiti in November is nice but tends to be far more humid and closer to the sun so the UV is a bit extra intense. Do you have anything to add that is on topic?"
"Hypocrisy at its very finest. Go back and re-read this thread.I am certain that Tahiti will be just lovely in November, if you can get there."
"""Hypocrisy"" whatever you need to say to make yourself feel better. I'll be eventually to go in November, whether 2021, 2022, 2026, or whatever year, November is November. Thanks for focusing back on the topic! Take care."
