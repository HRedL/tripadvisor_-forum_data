"The reproduction rate in Germany was down today to .75. Those of you who worried that the rate was going up due to false news headlines the other day can relax a little now. Germany is now pushing for all internal EU borders to be open for free travel by June 15. It also appears they want the external EU border open, too. It is definitely possible this summer however at this time things can change at a moments notice. My guess is most people in their lives had a to give up summer holidays abroad or take an abbreviated holiday at some time. So this year may be one of those years. Germany will still be around next year and the years after."

"Posters 6 and 7. Completely understandable. Ignore the disease Troll-- actual numbers do not lie, fools do.Looking forward to future travels in Germany. Probably fall or December 2021. Be well and stay safe. Grüße"
"""Abuse"" translates to: repeatedly pointing out and proving that you were wrong, something that you obviously cannot bear. At some point people lose their patience..."
"No, ""abuse"" means almost everything thing I say, including my opinions, are met with unwarranted condescending remarks. I wonder why the previous post was taken down. That poster was right on the mark and said what needed to be said."
"I wonder why it was taken down too, Trizssa - it was my post. Apparently, it is acceptable for Germans to advocate (and, given the tone of the comments, celebrate) the inability of Americans to travel to Germany. I can positively tell you it would not be acceptable for Americans to say on TA, in the N.Y. forum, that all Germans should not be allowed into the U.S. - and I would be the first to condemn anyone who made such a comment or even hinted at it (as would almost all in New York). The hypocrisy is palpable. But this post will undoubtedly be taken down by TA too under the guise it is “off topic”. But I guess the posts celebrating the barring of Americans is on topic?"
"It's not us pushing a certain political agenda but your orange buffon. So for the time being, yes we are relieved that US Americans will be barred from entering Schengen /EU /Germany simply based on the abysmal handling of the pandemia by your government for the foreseeable future. This has nothing to do with politics or nationalism, it's simply based on the infection rates and the pretty much uncontrolled outbreak of the Sars cov 2 in US.Edited: 7:46 pm, May 17, 2020 "
"Sorry Skihaslerlmuc, that is not the case. I have been blessed with few talents but one of the few I have is a pretty good command of the English language - those posts do not mention Trump, they are a blatant attack on a nationality. Right? Are you telling me that the comments of two individuals who posted on this thread are acceptable? Seriously? So much for liberal thought in Germany. And you are unlikely to come across a more anti-Trump person than me....Edited: 7:56 pm, May 17, 2020 "
""" I have been blessed with few talents ""Really. I'll tell you what, you should use the exceptional talent you have in putting those posters in place in doing good all over the world. You can start with NY and tell every single politician that it's the beginning of the end of the waste, incompetence and abuse power - people will soon be able to live and create their lives without interference from no one. I would also really appreciate if someone can tell Germany to open up the borders to international travel by June 15! Even the WHO said they disagree with travel bans. It says right on their website if you need proof. If the health data indicates otherwise by then then keep the borders closed."
"Well, folks in NYC can do whatever they please (subject to the rational temporary restrictions now in place, which hardly impinge on anyone’s freedom) so I don’t think many are complaining about their lives being interfered with. I do see Italy is opening up its borders to EU residents starting on June 3rd with no quarantine, so maybe by September, or perhaps even a bit earlier, U.S. residents will be allowed to travel to at least some European countries. But I don’t see Germany being open to U.S. residents (if you are one) by June 15.I am also an Irish citizen, but since Ireland has an even higher rate of infection than the U.S., I assume a number of the posters on this thread would adopt the stance of No Irish Need Apply with respect to entering Germany. At any rate, the language and tone of those posters reveals that what is paramount to them is keeping the undesirables out of pristine and pure Germany. And I say that as one who has visited Germany numerous times and love visiting the country and meeting Germans. But the remarks of a few on this thread should be objectionable to anyone with a shred of decency and an attempt to highlight the vile and abhorrent nature of those remarks should not be censored by TA as “off topic” or blithely dismissed by other posters as unhappiness with the current occupant of the White House.Edited: 10:37 pm, May 17, 2020 "
"I meant government interfering in the lives of citizens in general. The kind that has been going on for decades in all kinds of ways. This pandemic situation illustrates it perfectly in the global sense: The Chinese government covers it up; the rest of the world's government are unprepared. For only a fraction of what the government wastes per year we could have been totally prepared and we would not be in the position we are currently in, even with the Chinese government."
"@, +1. Orange buffoon is now in the process of another (surprise) deflection in that our disease rate and death rate is somehow our own fault. It is hell to grow old. I just want him to keep eating Hamberders and fries 10 times a day. Ireland has reported 24,112 total cases, the US 1,486,742 as I write this. New York has reported over 14 times the cases in Ireland and my base in Louisiana has reported more cases than Ireland. Infection rate is what it is based on general circumstances.Regarding this or that group, the US has banned people from various countries from entering. PC correct or not, it is a fact of life. Dare say many want a throng of folks from some countries to enter their country, no matter where it is, especially, where the virus originated and data is sketchy at best. New York's new reported cases as of this morning is 1,889. Numbers are updated throughout the day. However, per the disease poor little abused troll insanity, it has no chance of disappearing in its predicted week time frame. Safe travels, be well. Report poor abused trolls. ;>)"
"https:/…countriesAs evidenced by the above link, I correctly noted the infection rate is higher in Ireland than the U.S. “We in the law” like to get our facts straight. Except for those who pretentiously spout obscure legal doctrines in Latin and utilize those doctrines in a completely inapposite manner."
"But the noxious tactics of some on this thread of demonizing a particular group and misstating facts is indeed reminiscent of Trump. The message may be different, but the methods are all too familiar."
"@Rutgers83, I did not disagree with you, I just could not find the infection rate. I'm ex medical industry and was involved in clinical trials. I can make statistics look anyway I want to within constraints. I have canceled trips across the big pond. I am unaware of spouting obscure legal doctrine most is common sense, or so says my Constitutional attorney daughter. Our Orange Totalitarian Idiot is more than obscure except for his loyalty oath required of everyone. As we say, PV-nrT where T is in degrees Kelvin= universal truth on this planet. I have a niece and her family in that obscure place called New Rochelle and other friends on Long Island. Be well, be safe Report those poor abused conspiracy trolls.Edited: 10:26 am, May 18, 2020 "
"""""""As evidenced by the above link, I correctly noted the infection rate is higher in Ireland than the U.S. """"""OK, at the moment. But you've forgotten that the virus hit Europe 2 weeks before USA. So wait 2 more weeks and then we can discuss again.And the next point: Ireland did twice as much tests per 1 Mill. than USA. And you for sure can be conform with me: the more tests you make the more cases you'll find."
"And you were the person on another thread who said objective analysis (which really means your opinion) indicated we had two bad choices in 2016, right? There was only one bad choice, Trump, unless you fell for the vicious and false attacks on Clinton. And you did disagree with me and are now backpedaling as fast as you can having been confronted with facts (which have been widely reported in numerous sources if one bothers to look). Happy travels to you."
"Sorry, are you speaking about me?? But these was NOT me."
"You are welcome for the information ReiseBeate. Now you actually have some data. And as you now have data and some insist you weren’t simply attacking a group on the basis of their nationality, what citizens of other countries do you think should be barred from entering Germany due to the infection rate in their place of residence?Also, I know you are aware of the maximum attributed to Voltaire that “I may disagree with what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it.” In that vein, surely you agree that my post number 9 should not have been taken down as “off topic” and join me in urging TA to repost it immediately."
"Number 24 was not directed at you ReiseBeate, but our friend from Louisiana. The messages crossed, sorry for any confusion.Edited: 10:55 am, May 18, 2020 "
"Rutgers, sorry but I don't know what you had written in Post # 9. I also didn't know that this post was from you and I haven't it deleted.""""""""what citizens of other countries do you think should be barred from entering Germany """"""In my opinion only Europeans and citizen from Schengen Area should be allowed to enter Germany."
"""Our Orange Totalitarian Idiot""At least you agree with me that democracy is really bad - the majority gets it way. I don't know how you can call someone an ""idiot"" when they were elected president of the US and they were not even in politics. That's very difficult o accomplish."
"Why would you let folks from Ireland, Luxembourg, Spain and Belgium in? Their infection rates are higher than the U.S. By the way, as of a week ago, if you took out NY and NJ, the infection rate in the U.S. was nearly identical to the rate in Germany.Edited: 11:22 am, May 18, 2020 "
"No, their infection rate is NOT higher. As I wrote: wait 2 weeks to get a comparable result. And if we agree or not: all your mentioned countries are European Countries and in Schengen Areo. So we really don't can their people block of coming to Germany. We have ""open borders"", what only was closed because of an emergency."
"But between you and me, you had no idea of the infection rates when you posted you and most Germans would be happy if Americans weren’t allowed in, right? Your post just said keep ‘em out, nary a word about infection rates, right?Edited: 11:41 am, May 18, 2020 "
Look at Denmark now. It certainly looks like the virus will disappear shortly and I read they are saying there will be no second wave.
I am not aware of a single reputable person who has said there will not be a second wave.
"""""right?""""""No, nothing is right. I know and knew the infection rates and I know why I wrote this.And another point: Can you in USA stop tourists travelling mayby from Utah to Colorado? I think, no or only in a case of emergency, right?So we here in the EU and Schengen cannot stop people travelling from one country to another, only in a case of emergency. BUT: we can stop people from outside Europe or Schengen entering Europe. And this is what we should do.A postscript: user # 33 is a known troll here."
"I'm not sure where I read it but it looked like it was from an official source. I also read that because of this they will not be shutting down again. It could be the virus is in fact disappearing, just like coronaviruses do. I think people need to keep an open mind that it might in fact might happen; not that it will."
"""So we here in the EU and Schengen cannot stop people travelling from one country to another,""The Schengen can do that much easier than in the US. This ""us against then"" mentality is really dumb. Why don't you just put a border around Munich or Hamburg or any city, town region, etc.. You could even wall off your neighborhood. I hope out of this virus disaster comes the abolishment of all borders in the world. People have the right to go where and when they want."
"@Rutgers83, I apologize but I think I misconstrued your posts. I could not vote for either candidate and I guess I have read many articles about the difficult choices many faced in the election. Too many dirty tricks and admissions from high ranking Dems regarding town hall/debate questions and those working inside the party to make sure Clinton was being championed over Sanders. Ergo, I voted for a Libertarian. This election my vote will not be for #45. Regarding travel, I appreciate the sentiments. Holding out hope that my wife and I get to head to Germany in December. With continuing active cases and the most probable second wave, my confidence is a max of 10%. Also, it appears things are being written regarding reducing Christmas Markets. My wish is that the folks in the Schengen Area get back to a more normal life and not have to worry about tourists. I am on line a fair amount simply because I am reviewing clinical trial parameters for a Pharma company. I crunch numbers for the parameters and make suggestions. Waiting for an email to confirm/alter suggestions. I appreciate the link you shared.Hopefully, we can all get back to traveling when it is safe to do so. Bummer that we had to cancel an anniversary trip to France - supposed to leave in a week and a half and have rescheduled our canal barge tour in Burgundy. Safe travels, be well."
"@ReiseBeate, +10, LOL. Get ready for it to change its screen name because of abuse and attacks. LOL, Ich wünschte, ich hätte ein Weizenbier in München. ;>)"
"https:/…index.htmlPlease see the story linked above. I could post many other stories stating that when the Schengen zone reopens, it may reopen between Schengen countries with similar epidemiological rates. But I am tired of doing work for others so I am only posting one story. Suffice it to say that the EU apparently does not share ReiseBeate’s view on the legalities of travel within the Zone."
"@Rutger83, just PM'd you. Be well."
"Rutger, I don't understand what you are speaking off in # 40. As I wrote you, Europe CAN close the borders in a case of emergency. And this is and was given with Corona. But Europe don't want to open the border for non-Europeans at this time. Have you read the linked article. Here is written:""""""Visitors from outside the EU could still face an indeterminate wait though."""""""
"""Europe CAN close the borders in a case of emergency. And this is and was given with Corona""If you're so smart tell me, why does the WHO not recommend travel restrictions at all? The WHO is the World Health Organization. Most countries in the world are members, including European countries. Another way government does you in."
"ReiseBeate - see your post number 35. The article contradicts your contention that the E.U. cannot bar citizens of a particular member nation from traveling to another member nation. In fact, the article states the E.U. is contemplating doing exactly that based on rates of infection. And, in case you haven’t noticed, we all are in an emergency. Hence, my question whether you personally would favor barring from Germany people from Spain, Ireland, Luxembourg and Belgium as the epidemiological rates in those countries is even higher than that of the U.S. ?Edited: 2:23 pm, May 18, 2020 "
"As I told you in # 35: in a case of emergency. And that was it, but it is no longer.And for the numbers of cases: I asked you to wait 2 weeks more, because the virus hit Europe about 2 weeks before USA. Wait what happens in 2 weeks in USA, then we can talk again."
"It appears now all countries in the EU will be open to all members by or on June 15. That's great news. Even better news will be if they allow US citizens in by July 15. I'm a very careful person, always practice good hygiene (for many years) and am completely afraid of getting sick but I have absolutely no fear of getting on a plane to Germany right now. I need my Ostfriesentee! Please don't tell me to order it online. Drinking it is a totally different experience in Germany. As a citizen of the world I say ""Open the borders to everyone""."
A truly Trumpian set of responses by you ReiseBeate. Congratulations.
"Sorry I see nothing Trumpian (sic) about her responses ,member states of the Schengen area closed their borders. hey are allowed to do this under the treaty. They all wish now to reopen the borders and that will most likely include other EU countries not in Schengen. However the external borders will remain closed for some time."
"@ReiseBeate So much for the cracker jack scientists that the T Troll promoted in its first screen name. Said T Troll predicted that Covid19 would be gone in about 2 weeks in NYC. We are now almost 4 weeks past that expert opinion/prediction. Cases have decreased but unfortunately over 941 new Cases were reported in the State of New York and more than 100 in NYC in the past 24 hours. A T troll of another name change is coming. Cases are rapidly increasing in many states in the US. Sad. Be well, be healthy, report Trolls."
You have time to post on multiple subjects about someone's opinions? Go look at Italy now. What did the top doctor say recently. Then if you apologize I would accept. This is a time for love in the world. We need love AND revolution.
