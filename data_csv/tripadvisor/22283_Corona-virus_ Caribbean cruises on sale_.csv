Now that another cruiser has been attacked by Corona virus are there sales expected for the cruise tickets? I have never been on a cruise but if I can make it cheap I could consider it this spring/late winter.
Wouldn’t get on a cruise ship right now if you paid me $500 a night.
"RJR-NJ: I always Love your posts. You are always right on and deadpan funny.But I am thinking you are very serious now.!And I sure don't disagree!!My wife and I have flights to Aruba on April 2. We are volunteering for a United Dogs Spay/Neuter MASH scheduled on the island for then.If the event is not canceled, and no cases found in Aruba by then, we will still go.We are in the Pacific Northwest, and it's becoming infected here. So unless we go in to lock down, no where is 100 percent safe.But cruise ships, no, I only went once, never again, and it felt tooo close, tooo many people in one space....Without! a virus!!"
"<< ""But I am thinking you are very serious now.!"" >>State Department warns Americans not to travel by cruise ship as coronavirus cases risehttps:/…(CNN) — The State Department is urging Americans not to board cruise ships as coronavirus cases rise across the US.The warning is particularly for people with underlying health conditions, the State Department said in an advisory on Sunday.Underlying conditions include heart disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes and conditions that suppress the immune system, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in separate guidance recommending that people with such conditions “defer all cruise ship travel worldwide.”The CDC said it usually advises against destinations — not transportation — during outbreaks, but that the novel coronavirus is an exception."
I too love RJPs postsAnd agree.... never have been in a cruise and have no desire.....
"Oh Yeah! I get it.Am reading the CDC updates as well.But, I'm thinking...like the OP,.... .prices for cruises, and flights, might drop dramatically.for the future. So why not book a Cut Rate flight/cruise , insure it, and pay 100$ change fee if one has too.?I know for sure we want to fly to South Africa next May, and with this crisis...I might be looking at the best cheap tickets ever? who knows.RJP-NJ-that's what I thought your ""typical"" response would be....Grab Tickets Now!sorry, just sayin"""
"""But I am thinking you are very serious now""Ummm.Not to be snarky but see your postJanuary 27, """"...as long as you are not connected through China I wouldn't worry about it""Your words, not mine."
"<< ""see your post January 27,"" >>Won't bother going to look it up, but pretty sure that thread wasn't regarding a cruise. (Plus... Jan 27 to Mar 9 is a million years ago in coronovirus terms.)The SS Petri Dish will be sailing without me.:-)"
"We have been on 4 cruises in that last few years, but at this time...you could not pay me to be on a cruise....as a matter of fact, I have an offer for a balcony room on any MSC Caribbean sailing in March - free cruise, just pay taxes. Not at this time, thank you!"
"There are reports of some Caribbean islands closing their ports to cruise ships, allegedly because their healthcare systems couldn’t cope with an outbreak either caused by visiting passengers or amongst passengers on a visiting ship.Even if you did get a bargain it might have a weird itinerary or possibly simply an awful lot of sea days. It might be a great deal or maybe not. And could you be sure when you’d get off?"
<< “ There are reports of some Caribbean islands closing their ports to cruise ships‘ >>As of this moment there are no ports with blanket closings; some have prohibited specific ships with suspected/verified corona cases onboard from docking.Could change between the time I type this and hit “post your reply” — I believe Atlantis in Bahamas is not currently selling day passes to cruise passengers.
Sorry should have been more precise.https://www.cruisecritic.co.uk/news/5097/
They usually dont anyway....its NOT because of the hysteria.
"2 days ago I decided to look at NCL (my cruise line) and saw 7 day inside cabin guarantee for $250- on their newer boats. I pretended to book. To my dismay the price went up like there was no corona virus (no, not taxes and port charges- that I understand).I looked again carefully and they have included all 5 "" free"" offers- unlimited drinks, dining package, wifi, $50 shore excursion, and one more I can't remember. As you all know, you have to pay for the gratuity on the drinks and dining package. That raised the prices up! There was NO way to uncheck those FREE!!! inclusions. NOrmally, you can see the price detail on your booking, Cruise price, tax and port charges, and your gratuitites for extras. This time I can't.So their cheap price is not really cheap when they bundle their other extras on. I don't drink. For me, their regular restaurant food is good enough. Don't get wifi since it is slow. I believe that quite a few passengers would not book these extras anyway. But you are forced to pay for their them anyway ( the service charge,etc).Well, today I went back in. The same cruise is now $499. No FREE extras anymore. And you can see the price detail again.I looked at cruises leaving this Month.So watch the prices . Cheap may not really be cheap."
