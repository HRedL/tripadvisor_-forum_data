"Hello, I booked 14(!!) tours with a very popular Italian tour company (that I won’t name) for a trip to Italy I was supposed to be taking about 2 weeks from now. One of the major reasons I even chose this particular tour company is that they proudly declared in various places on their website their great (“one of the best in Europe”) cancellation policy offering a full refund on your tours if you cancel more than 24h in advance. However, due to everything that’s going on with the coronavirus, I’ve had to completely cancel my trip to Italy (and not of my own free will—the country I’m from has literally placed a travel ban on Italy. I would be barred from returning home if I still went on my trip). I’m now noticing that the cancellation policy on their website has changed in the last few days. For example, one of my tours has suddenly been added as an exception to their refund policy (I had taken a screenshot of the cancellation policy that was in place at the time of my bookings—this exception was certainly not there when I booked). “That’s fine,” I thought. “This change will only apply to bookings made after they instated this change in their policy. The original policy that was in place when I made my booking months ago will be honored.” Well, this didn’t happen. In fact, when I called to cancel my tours, I was told that they, within the last few days, have made ANOTHER policy change whereby ALL tours are subject to a 30% cancellation fee even if cancelled more than 24h in advance, and that it would now apply to me if I tried to cancel my tours today. This new 30% fee policy hasn’t even been mentioned on their website yet!I told them that this has to be illegal, or at the very least is extremely unfair, and asked to speak to a manager. He said he understands my frustrations but that in Italy, they’re allowed to change cancellation policies whenever they like to protect them from situations such as now where a bunch of people are cancelling their tours due to panic generated by the coronavirus. Is this true?! Is this really the norm in Italy? I’m honestly considering filing a dispute with my credit card company. Please advise!"
"Well, it’s not the best to put all your eggs in one basket (14 tours?) and to choose a company from a marketing ploy of “they’re the best”. I feel if you purchased tickets under the assumption of a stated refund policy on their website, you have a case and if you have proof of such, all the better. False advertising or possible company fraud comes to mind but if you didn’t read the “fine print” when you first purchased the tours (which negates refunds due to XYZ)....then you may be out of luck. I hope you can resolve this."

"If you wish to warn others about the cancellation policies of a company, perhaps you should name the tour company."
"MomCat,Yes, thankfully, I for some reason thought to take a screenshot of the policy that was in place when I booked the tours. I never thought that I’d one day have to use it, however. I let the manager know that I would resolve the issue through my credit card company and he suddenly changed his tune, saying he’d try to resolve the issue for me and call me back within the next few hours. I am waiting for his call and then I’ll decide whether to take the route of doing a chargeback on my credit card.Edited: 10:36 am, February 28, 2020 "
"Chester9cat,Thank you for assuming I solely chose this company based on a “marketing ploy”. I said ONE of the main reasons, not the only reason, I went with this company was their cancellation policy. In addition to that, this was one of the Italian tour companies most commonly recommended when I was doing my research. The company is Rick Steves recommended and I read multiple great reviews and recommendations for the company on Reddit, TripAdvisor, Rick Steves forums, as well as articles and blogs by travel experts. Excuse me for choosing a company that appeared to get rave reviews online AND had a seemingly good cancellation policy based on the information that they themselves had listed on the cancellation policy page of their website at the time of booking. Yes, I also considered booking a few tours with another highly rated tour company instead, but the total cost ended up being more favorable to go solely with this tour company due to a deal you get for booking multiple tours with them (I also understandably thought to myself, should I realize I don’t like this tour company after the first few tours, I could always cancel for a full refund as per the cancellation policy they had advertised when I chose them). There was no “fine print” on their website. I read the entire cancellation policy page, took a screenshot of it, and the same “refund on all tours cancelled more than 24h in advance” policy was referenced on multiple pages of the website including their FAQ page and a page on Travel Insurance."
"ocpony,This post (as of right now) isn’t me trying to warn others about their cancellation policy. It’s about me trying to confirm if what I was told by the manager about this sort of thing being allowed/normal behavior in Italy is true, or if I was lied to, from persons who are more familiar with these things than I am. I don’t want to escalate the situation until I know for certain that they are undoubtedly in the wrong here. If I confirm that I was indeed lied to, then yes, I will definitely release the name of the tour company."
"@S Y, thank you for clarifying. Hope you get a good resolution to this. Thankfully you have screen shots, if the company doesn't honor the cancellation, your credit card company should be able to help. Good luck to you, sounds like you did your homework and company is doing a CYA."
"I’m sorry that my post was flippant in parts and had you presented your in-depth research process, I would not have tossed out those comments. We read so many posts from those who find themselves in a pickle due to lack of research or foresight that sometimes we just get frustrated. I do and did wish for the best and a speedy resolve in your situation.Edited: 11:40 am, February 28, 2020 "
"I'm sure this company is taking a big hit, like everybody else in Italy. I wouldn't waste any more time on this, as I'm sure this guy is very busy and not likely to get back to you. Just contact the credit card company, and be prepared to give them whatever proof you have. If the cc company won't do anything, then forget about it and consider it a lesson learned."
"Just an update:The manager actually called me back. They’re still refusing to honor the original cancellation policy and expecting me to pay the 30% cancellation fee, so I’m taking the route of filing a dispute with my credit card company. The company is The Roman Guy/The Tour Guy. They just (as in, within the last few hours) added a section to their cancellation policy page stating “Refunds may be subject to a cancellation fee, which may vary by tour, situation, or case. Fees are not limited to, but could include the ticket cost for tours that require the purchase of a ticket in advance.” This wasn’t on the page when I checked it earlier today. Luckily, I have the screenshot of the page from January when I originally booked the tours as well as one from this morning before this particular addition was made sometime today. I cannot believe them."
"This epidemic is going to wipe out a whole load of companies serving tourists, including possibly this tour company. You may find that it does not have enough money to make refunds to all its clients."

"Well, it is not in any way the fault of the tour company, either. Is it fair that it should have to refund money because people are prevented from travelling?"
Forget about the tour guy and just deal with your credit card company.
yes it is completely fair that they refund per their policies. They do it because in the future this S.Y would probably come back and book and tell his/her friends. The company having the funds is not an issue...the cc will get a resolution and from all that has been posted they are entitled to their money back and are well documented. Many people would never have had the smarts to take that screenshot and be stuck. Good luck to S.Y. it will take some serious follow up with your cc company . Normally the threat if a dispute will encourage a fast refund from the vendor because a few of those and they will not longer be permitted to take the cc. The Roman Guy is not too smart.
Was this the roman guy? Tour guy? Can you please share the screenshot?
Hi! Would you mind sharing this screenshot/policy? i think it would help alot of people.
Would you mind sharing the original cancellation/refund policy? Pm me for a private email address.
