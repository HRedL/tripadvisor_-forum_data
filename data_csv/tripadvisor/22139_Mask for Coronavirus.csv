"Hi everyone.My wife and I will arrive in Hanoi on 4th March, and will spend a week there. We will spend almost all our time in Hanoi, barring a 1N/2D cruise to Bai Tu Long Bay. While we will obviously follow routine good practices (washing hands frequently, carrying a hand sanitizer etc.), would you also recommend a mask during this time? How are the locals dealing with the Coronavirus threat?"
Vietnam is free of the virus at the moment. Many locals are still wearing masks possibly more than normal but all is fine.
"Thanks, viet1. I take it that we'll be fine without a mask!"
Where is a Coronavirus thread? Got deleted? Hah?
"Thank god , finally a coronavirus thread ......"
"It has been reported on many threads on Vietnam TA forums for at least 5 weeks now that most tourists are not wearing face masksIf it makes you feel safer wearing one & washing your hands all the time, then do it. Stopping reading & watching all the sensationalising news will also make you feel safer too :) lolI didn't bother wearing face masks or washing my hands all the time during my 7 week trip to SE Asia earlier this year, and amazingly I am still perfectly fit & healthy now"
Don’t come. Stuck in Hanoi airport and they are saying they are quarantine people who have been to a country with an outbreak. We just had a 3 hour layover in Incheon
"Good day...You are saying that Hanoi quarantine passengers arriving from << infected >> countries...... Thanks for the info.... Is there an official site, English language website, providing a list of countries subjected to quarantine in Vietnam ?Thanks all."
Are they actually quarantining everyone from all countries that have cases of Coronavirus? I understand quarantine for people arriving from Korea as that has been made clear on their websites. I’m flying Canada to Taipei and then straight to Hanoi. Both Canada and Taiwan have cases. Would this also fall under quarantine measures? I’m not worried about getting sick. Just want to get into the country and enjoy my vacation.
"Lots of countries are adding epidemic countries to their quarantine list as the outbreak in that country gets worse.I can't find a Vietnamese government site that states these countries but this is the latest update on the Australian Smartraveller (gov) Website.https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinationsUpdated:28 February 2020Latest update:Vietnam has introduced new entry restrictions in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19). If you’ve travelled to Daegu or Cheongdo in South Korea, as well as mainland China, in the last 14 days, you'll be denied entry. Expect additional health screening at entry points. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you’ll be quarantined. Check with your airline, tour operator or the nearest Vietnamese embassy for the latest on entry requirements.Great for all countries advice..Hope that helps..."
This website is helpful too for all travellers.https:/…1580226297.htmHope Singapore does not make the list before the F1 Grand Prix as I fly through there.
It’s way more than that. We travelled through incheon airort and were denied entry. No health screening what so ever. Just a flat no. We are goi g to be out a lot of money as G adventures has not tried to help us in the matter.
Wow! So are you back in Incheon right now or stuck at the airport? Did you have to pay for another flight? This is exactly what I’m fearful of.
"Sorry to hear that Canada. This is exactly what i was trying to avoid, i.e be denied entry. Our plan for later this spring, was to fly Japan-Taiwan-Vietnam. we will check on a daily basis before embarking on our next trip.Thanks. Have a nice day."
"Thanks, viet1. I take it that we'll be fine without a mask!===============================Masks wont help you. They are only useful for people who already have the virus to help stop spreading it.. Read what medical experts are saying, instead of opinions on the internet."
"Don't be worry. Vietnam is still safe destination. The list of the country which is mentioned by Vietnamese goverment: Korea, China, Taiwan, Hongkong."
"""I can't find a Vietnamese government site that states these countries""This Government portal report on restriction on travel from Korea also mentions mandatory quarantine for travellers from Iran and Italy…chinhphu.vn/Home/…38991.vgpRegardsrayzaEdited: 11:15 pm, February 29, 2020 "
"Hi Canada, we just returned from a 3 week trip in Vietnam and Cambodia....no problems. We did not wear masks but washed our hands with soap and water as much as possible and carried lots of wipes and hand sanitizer. The good news for us was that most tourist locations were not crowded, of course not good for those who depend on tourist dollars."
jusy Go and enjoy and stop worrying. It’s a nanny state we leave in now
"Sincere advice for you and your family when traveling to Hanoi during the Corona season is: always wear a mask when going to crowded places, wash your hands with liquid when you go to the toilet ....Currently, Vietnam in general and Hanoi capital in particular is one of the countries and cities which are very effective in preventing Corona disease.Wishing you a wonderful and healthy journey!"
"We are flying into Hanoi March 6th via Taiwan. Had to change our original flight that was going through Seoul 2 days ago...Travelocity nor Air Canada were aware that flights from Korea to Vietnam had been cancelled at that time. We are bringing a few masks ""just in case"" as a friend who lives there tells me they are in short supply."
"""We are bringing a few masks ""just in case"" as a friend who lives there tells me they are in short supply.""So I guess the fact that wearing a mask offers zero protection from catching a virus means nothing to you. Or the fact that medical professionals are literally begging people to stop buying masks as there is a shortage for medical staff is also meaningless to you.Herd mentality I guess."
All over the world medical experts are saying masks offer no protection and you come along.
"""Dr. Tedros (W.H.O director general) added on Tuesday that it was still possible to contain the virus, but warned that “rising demand, hoarding and misuse” of medical supplies such as masks could compromise the world’s ability to fight the outbreak""""Sadly no one will listen, as we can see by some of the posters here."

All the medics you see on the news who are dealing with infected patients are wearing face masks AND goggles as it can transmit through the eyes also.Unless you want to get around in a hazmat suit and change it regularly there is no point.Stocks are so hard to come by here in Australia that some GP's are resorting to Bunnings Hardware for masks. They are the ones who need the masks.
"My daughter has long-arranged vacation plans to travel to Vietnam starting March 18th. She has kept close eye on the coronavirus issues and was feeling good about going on her trip. Then, the virus appeared in Seattle, Wa where she lives. There is quite a cluster of cases (and deaths of elderly) there. So, now her concern is not with Vietnam exposure, but whether she will be slapped into quarantine upon arrival there because of the outbreak in Seattle, Wa. We’ve tried and tried to check through materials, but simply can’t divine what her risk of quarantine may be. Any ideas or insight?"
"> We’ve tried and tried to check through materials, but simply can’t divine what her risk of quarantine may beWell, if /she's/ showing signs of the virus, I'd say about 100%.If *anyone* on the plane is showing signs of the virus, then possibly the same answer. https:/…53313.htmlThe Vietnamese are working to a pretty aggressive containment policy, which has been fairly successful thus far."
"Thanks for the response. About what we’d teased out. *Sigh*. We do appreciate that Vietnam has been serious about containment —and pretty successful, which is why (before the Seattle debacle) she was leaning towards going. Her sister and brother-in-law are still going, but they are flying from elsewhere in the States that doesn’t have an outbreak.She has no signs, but . . . Still a few weeks away and who knows. Definitely would expect quarantine if signs showed up. Were wondering if the whole plane would be slapped into quarantine given where the flight originated (Seattle) and/or if someone person showed signs..Seems a bit wrong for the airline to originate a flight in Seattle and not be willing to refund, but business is business, I guess."
"Just in now from SmarttravellerWe now advise all Australians to reconsider your need for overseas travel at this time.Regardless of your destination, age or health, if your overseas travel is not essential, consider carefully whether now is the right time.We have issued this advice for two principal reasons:1. You may be more exposed to contracting COVID-19 while travelling overseas. You may come in contact with more people than usual, including during long-haul flights and in crowded airports. Health care systems in some countries will come under strain and may not be as well-equipped as Australia’s. If you’re sick, you may not have your normal support networks.2. Overseas travel has become more complex and unpredictable. Many countries are introducing entry or movement restrictions. These are changing often and quickly. Your travel plans may be disrupted. You may be placed in quarantine or denied entry to some countries, and you may need to self-quarantine on return to Australia. Think about what this might mean for your health, and your family, work or study responsibilities.There are some countries and regions in the world where we advise you 'do not travel'. These are mostly for security reasons but some are also because of a very high risk of coronavirus transmission. Do not travel to these places.For all other destinations, you should reconsider your need to travel. This is a global advisory in light of the widespread nature of the COVID-19 outbreak and the significant measures in place to curb it. Individual country advisories may not yet display a ‘reconsider’ advice level. You should nevertheless reconsider your need to travel to all destinations. These country pages will be updated and remain an essential of source of information on country-specific risks and contact information. If you’re overseas and can’t or don’t want to return to Australia, follow the advice of local authorities. Take care to minimise your risk of exposure to coronavirus. Contact your airline, travel agent or insurance company to discuss your travel plans and options for cancelling or postponing current bookings, or to arrange flights back to Australia.
