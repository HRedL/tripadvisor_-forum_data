What happens if we travel to Mexico for a vacation soon and we come down with Covid while we are there?

"If your symptoms are serious enough to see a doctor, you will be in isolation at a hospital for at least 2 weeks at your expense."
I would suggest you buy travel insurance to provide medical coverage as regular US health insurance will not cover you in a foreign country. Beyond that it depends how bad it is you may have to quarantine in your room or be taken to a hospital I would suggest not letting them transport you to a clinic as they can be questionable in Mexico.
Is there a difference between a clinic and a hospital? I’m supposed to arrive there on Tuesday. I keep changing my mind over whether I should come or not.
Certainly purchase travel insurance. We are going in Sept and bought a GeoBlue policy that fully covers COVID (as well as everything else). We found it using a website called insuremytrip.com.
You really do not want to risk coming here and getting sick - you would not be able to fly home and would find yourself alone in a hospital isolation ward with staff that do not speak English.
"travel insurance will cover you from the day you specify when you purchase,,,,if you get sick with virus on holiday you will need to prove that you did not have the virus before the start date of coverage,,,so you must get tested after the insurance begins to show you are negative,,,,,,,,otherwise will be many problems making any claims.......READ THE SMALL PRINT....virus tests are not 100% and insurance company will use every loophole not to pay if you are hospitalized in mexico with large medical bills......GOOD LUCK"
"Never let facts get in the way of fear mongering. No your policy will not automatically not cover you because they’re going to claim you had Covid in advance and you will have to prove you didn’t have it. Read your policy, and what you’re probably Discover is the statement above is a total fabrication design to make sure you never travel. I’m not telling you you should or should not go, but you need to base your decision on facts not based on some insurance expert who didn’t read your policy. Because I’ve read mine and his statement is totally false"
"Carol A May i ask which insurance you bought? All these different ones are kinda confusingEdited: 5:21 pm, August 08, 2020 "
"I have looked at two policies. I have two different policies for two different trips to different places. I have one with a company called world nomads and one with TravelExPlease note that I only buy health insurance. Both my trips, one to Mexico and one next spring someplace else, are fully cancelable if I decide not to go. So I’m only looking for health coverage in both places"
"I feel I have to jump in here because Carol A thinks she is an authority on everything Mexico. Unfortunately *most* travel policies and health insurance travel policies policies abroad *will not* cover pre-existing medical conditions, unless it is a pre-existing condition that was diagnosed some time ago (e.g. a Dx greater than 2 years ago). I guess they figure if one can live with the Dx for ~ 2 years, it is not an acute situation. Anyway....And that example of a long-term diagnosis with a pre-existing condition, one may find that there are the occasional one-off companies that will cover the pre-existing condition should it flare up and become an issue while on holiday. But as a general rule, you can be comfortable knowing most companies will not cover pre-existing conditions, to include Coronavirus. Good luck. Personally I believe that NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO TRAVEL TO MEXICO. ¡Diviertanse!"
"Carol A...as i said GOOD LUCK when you make a claim...hospitalization in mexico will be very expensive and YOU will pay,,,,then expect a long slow battle to try and get payout from insurer,,,,,"
I work in healthcare and as a result have a lot of experience with healthcare policies I have read my policies and I know what they say abut you have not and you know what it says. Very interesting
"I remember before Covid the countless comments of conditions and treatment of Mexican Hospitals not being to the standards of other countries unless you are of the super rich. Imagine how you would be ultimately treated along with other patients with the shortage of Doctors and Nurses right now, and the meager pay that they receive for their tireless work they perform.Edited: 8:23 pm, August 08, 2020 "
"Carol A,And I am a licensed insurance agent (both P&C and Life, Accident and Health) claims adjuster in all 50 states. I know I have read and Interpreted more policies looking for coverage than you can ever hope to imagine, working in healthcare. Anyway...¡Diviertanse!"
"You are already stressed about a lot of things so I don't know what is the point of going... A vacation is supposed to be relaxing and fun, which unfortunately is not going to happen right now... The last thing I want is to catch Covid-19 in a foreign country, some people are confident that their body will react as if it's a simple flu but nobody knows for sure, it could be much worse... Also so many things to worry about with social distancing, masks, whether things are clean, whether things are open and safe, etc... Anyways I might understand someone going because of an important family issue, but for a vacation it's not the right time... Maybe some countries I can understand, but right now Mexico is one of the hardest hit countries... But whatever you do good luck...!Edited: 9:37 pm, August 08, 2020 "
Getting sick from COVID-19 in Mexico – The Mexican nightmare....https:/…
"Bab you know anyone first hand, foreigner, who went through this? If folks don’t have 2 mil for treatment they are turned away w/ no service. I’ve been looking on FB groups & here for someone who personally went through this...not one post I’ve found the past few months. I hear folks say I heard this or heard that, or articles about cost, but not a soul has mentioned it personally happened to them, or direct family. If one doesn’t have $150k day pesos they will get no help, no test, & no treatment, is that right? This is what Ive been searching on, & yet to find anything.Edited: 7:10 am, August 09, 2020 "

"If a foreigner who doesn’t have the money for treatment/Covid test, what happens? I’ve just been searching the topic for a month trying to find one person who didn’t have the money, what happened to said foreigner? Forced isolation for 2 weeks, then back to X country via whatever flight said foreigner can obtain?Edited: 7:19 am, August 09, 2020 "
"If you do not have the money or insurance, to get treatment for medical conditions in a foreign country Stay home!. Ignore Covid that’s not even relevant. The other country is not your mother and they’re not responsible for taking care of you. What would you do if you fell and broke a leg? , what would you do if you had a heart attack? . I’ll tell you what you Will be in trouble. There was a person on Facebook a few years ago whose family was trying to set up a go fund me because he needed emergency surgery after a fall and the hospital wouldn’t do it because he didn’t have any money. He died.. Is it really worth it?So don’t think that I’m going roll the dice on Covid, because you’re probably actually going to not get Covid. but you don’t know if anything else is it going to happen. When you need a life flight home because you can’t get on a plane for whatever reason who is going to pay for that? that your mommy and daddy? your government? (Not for US citizens. ) I’ve only had to use the insurance once when we were on a Girl Scout trip, but I was forever grateful we had it for that person. Because while we were in the United Kingdom and got free treatment it was worth exactly what we paid for it. They basically told us that a 65-year-old woman could lose the use of her arm and that was not a problem because Of her age. The insurance company flew her home business class with a nurse in attendance where she got surgery and physical therapy and regained full use of her arm."
"Lonestar That’s actually scary, you are giving advice without reading my policy but you know what it says. And you’re in the industry? Sounds like you just tell your clients what you think the policy says because you don’t have to read them you know. Unbelievable thank God you’re not my agent"
"Just curious as to why the generalization is made that private insurance does not work in Mexico. We’ve been traveling for 30 years and have had some medical hiccups along the way. Every trip to a doctor or ER in Mexico was paid via credit card and reimbursed by our health insurance once submitted. No idea on Covid, but we’ve never purchased travel health insurance, only evacuation insurance."

"RedPuppieDog, I can't answer your initial question about ""what if"" but I just wanted to say good luck with your decision on whether to proceed with your pending travel plans. There is a lot to consider and it's not an easy decision. We are three weeks out from our travel date and I'm also still going back and forth. Good luck and safe travels (if you decide to go)!!"
"Some health insurance will cover you, some won’t. You will need to pay upfront however for most of them and get reimbursed. Sime travel insurance will actually work with your foreign hospitals that is one advantageAs a warning if you are covered by traditional Medicare the US government will not pay for any treatment outside of United States and its territories. Now if you have a supplement or a plan administered through one of the insurance companies that may be different you would need to check your plan"
"Actually Carol A, you are wrong again! It is YOU that knows one(1) policy, yours. I know the coverage and read each policy that I represent. I do this to prevent any surprises and as a licensed agent and have continuing education classes to be aware of any recent updates or modifications across the States.So unless you are an attorney or a licensed insurance agent/adjuster, you may want to quit giving legal or claims advice. Just saying...¡Diviertanse!"
"From post #3 “ as regular US health insurance will not cover you in a foreign country. ”Not true, that depends on your specific health care coverage. For example, Medicare does cover emergency medical care when in Mexico, of course in most cases you must submit a claim subsequent to the care. But we always travel with third-party travel insurance. Some travel insurance policies do provide medical and medivac coverages for sickness from COVID-19, read the policies thoroughly. And always choose a policy with PRIMARY medical and medivac coverages to minimize out-of-pocket expenses. We look for at least $50k (prefer $100k) medical and $1 million medivac, Allianz has been our choice the last few years for long-term coverage at the best coverage:cost ratio,..As an aside, we’ve found Hospiten to be excellent. Friends visiting from the US took our advice and got an Allianz policy and while here required an emergency room visit and 2-night stay. They were required to pay for the initial diagnosis and first night, but as soon as Allianz was contacted the rep immediately communicated with the hospital and took over, their out-of-pocket expense of $4k was reimbursed the next day. It was more expeditious because Allianz has already worked with that specific Hospiten in the past...[EDIT] Be considerate of the people here by being tested before your travel, AND practicing social distancing and masking while around others...Edited: 10:30 am, August 09, 2020 "
"Rainforest Hospiten is a private hospital - if you do not have insurance here you definitely want to have one heck of a balance on your card, or get the appropriate travel insurance. You will not be admitted if you do not have insurance or $$, there are public hospitals for those without insurance...Don’t want to start a side discussion on hospitals and clinics here, but we have been impressed with Hospiten on 307 and with the great clinics here. Just understand Hospiten is indeed a private hospital and not like the hospitals in the US. But nothing like being home if you contract this, if your home area is not overwhelmed like FL...Edited: 11:27 am, August 09, 2020 "
Make sure you take your refill of hydroxi pills and a bottle of bleach your good to go.
I know all too well about Hospiten since I was taken there by ambulance and stayed there.
"I do not believe Medicare will cover you outside of the United States. Except in rare occurrence and if you’re on vacation in Mexico that’s going to be very hard for that to be a rare occurrenceIf you have traditional Medicare do not go outside of the country without having some other type of insurance. Or be prepared to pay for your own medical care with no hope of reimbursementhttps:/…traveling-with-medicareNot sure what others are seeing but here is my Policy Of course I always buy insurance at the same time I spend the first money on vacation. If you decide today you need insurance for the trip tomorrow and you call them the next day and tell him you have Covid they may have some questions. That would probably fall into their pre-existing condition clause. If an insured or Traveling Companion contracts the coronavirus or is physically quarantined while coverage is in effect, they are eligible for Trip Cancellation/Trip Interruption coverage. An insured may also be eligible for Trip Cancellation/Trip Interruption coverage if a non-traveling Family Member is diagnosed with the coronavirus and is considered life-threatening or they require the insured’s immediate care. If an insured’s Business Partner is diagnosed with the coronavirus and the insured must cancel or interrupt the trip to assume daily management of the business. In all scenarios, the sickness must be certified by a physician at the time of cancellation/interruption.An insured is also eligible for Emergency Medical/Evacuation coverage if the insured contracts the coronavirus while traveling.It is important to note that fear of travel, travel advisories and destination being inaccessible due to this illness are not covered risks under the Travelex Insurance plans"
"2-14 days represents the current official estimated range for the novel coronavirus COVID-19.However, a case with an incubation period of 27 days has been reportedhow do you prove when you contracted the virus,,,,,that going to be a problem if you make a claim in mexico..the tests are not 100% reliable..how will you get back home,,,,you can not travel with other tourists...."
"Worst case scenario, if insurance won't cover you in Mexico then you can always try injecting yourself with disinfectant like Trump suggested. ;)"
I would suggest that you do not visit. The system there is stretched. Mexico and the US is not doing a good job of getting things under control. It's not the time for jolly holidays.
"This is what my policy reads,Pre-existing conditions include any medical condition, sickness, injury, illness, disease, mental Illness or mental or nervous disorder including congenital, chronic, subsequent, or recurring complications or resulting or related consequences that existed with reasonable medical certainty when you bought the plan or any time in the 36* months before your coverage on this plan began, whether or not previously manifested, symptomatic, known, diagnosed, treated, or disclosed.This includes, but is not limited to, any medical condition, sickness, injury, illness, disease, mental illness, or mental or nervous disorder for which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received or for which a reasonably prudent person would have sought treatment during the 36* months immediately preceding the start date of this plan.I showed this to an attorney friend and he said the part that reads “that existed with reasonable medical certainty when you bought the plan.........etc” that puts the burden of proof on the insurer. Reasonable medical certainty you would feel sick, have a fever and have been diagnosed as having cold/flu like symptoms. He said don’t worry about the insurance company fighting based on pre existence, if it went to court any decent lawyer would love to take the case.I will add there is an inclusion at a lower payout for pre existing conditions.Edited: 8:06 am, August 10, 2020 "
I also will add that he said things like Congestive heart failure or pancreatic cancer could be considered reasonably Certain to be pre existing. That is because they can reasonably ascertain that you had the condition for weeks if not months.
