"Warning!!!! The Travel2be website is very misleading with it's processing of paymet. It quotes you a price until the very end. Before you hit submit, it states a higher price ie. $172.00 and then it has a discount listed in parenthesis ie. (-$32.00) and then the final amount is again the amount you think you are paying ie $140.00. What happens is unless you use a Maestro card, you don't get the discount which is stated in very small print up above the confirm button. This is very very misleading as the bottom line still says what you think you are paying. So unless you are using a Maestro card the amount you pay is about the same as if you went to the airline directly. By the way I was redirected to the Travel2be site from Skyscanner.Edited: 4 years ago "
"Sky scanner is for looking for flights, not for booking them. Go with the airline if at all possible or at least an established company like Expedia."
"And did you use google to find trip advisor, I'm not sure of your point on sky scanner? . If you find the text is too small on your screen you can increase the size so you can read it. There is no such thing as "" print"" in electronic version, print is a physical thing,It's good that you say they provide the info and prior to purchase, just make sure in future if you find something too small to read then increase the text size, as well as research who you are buying from. The airline is the default first choice and in certain circumstances some good third parties, like a full service bricks and mortar travel agent or Expedia may be an option."
The way the total is presented is intentionally misleading. As the bottom line in large print and bold has the cheaper price which is what skyscanner advertised. As I stated: buyer beware as Travel2be's practices are intentional to mislead the customer.
"Hello, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"If does yes, but before you even get to put your details in, never mind pay, it tells you the total price if you chose a different payment method. It tells you that before you event select the flight, so early on in the process.Yes it's in smaller text, and if you're not paying attention you could miss it, but this means it tells you at least twice and you need to miss it at least twice. I'm not defending them, but the info is there."
"I experienced something worse, We have tickets booked to travel via Istanbul in august, Due to the recent events in Turkey we tried to change the booking to avoid going to Istanbul. We called Travel2be and the operator simply refused to help us out saying we should contact Turkish Airlines who already referred us to Travel2be."

travel2be i'm waiting to hear from you people concerning my transaction. refund back the money . emmankonbertt@gmail.com
I probably would not post my email address on this board. You really should private message Travelgenio and remove your post.
"Dear Emmankonbertt, we are going to send your question to our team. They will contact you asap. Regards and thanks for contacting us"
"First and last time to use this site. started searching with fare compare then sent to travel2be for payment... totally misleading final cost.. stated I was paying $375.72 Australian dollars inc all taxes, said special discount and no mastercard fee... total after hitting pay was $405,,, not happyt could have gotten it cheaper with airline company direct there price was $390... so contacted customer support straight away. payment wasn't even procedded at their end at that point. they said cancellation payment would be 30 euros. what a joke never deal with them again and spread the word to friends will be my mission."
Likely the difference between 375 and 405 was their fee of 30.
"I agree with Dubai_Phil, though nothing is ever absolutely certain with these companies. It's not unusual that you end up paying the same or more with OTA's that you would with the airline, so just book direct in future,"
"Hi Bronwyn, please send us all the info regarding the charges and the booking info to customer.service@travel2be.com and we will check them and contact you. Regards"
"I used travel2be for the first time last month, and apart from a small surcharge based on the fact that I used a different credit card, I didn't have any issue, the flights were booked solid and with no error, no problem of any sort, we traveled up and back, and those were the best prices I could find. So I will use it again and I am happy I didn't read all these bad reviews otherwise I would have been anxious for no reason. It is true though that the interface looks suspicious, not too many details on the confirmations, links don't work. BUT, you can use the booking code directly on the airline website to check your booking, and this is what I did.Edited: 3 years ago "
"HI GG65, thanks for your comment. We work hard to offer our best services. Sometimes there are some requirements that need to be approved by airlines when changes or delays are made, but they are the less cases. Best regards"
"I am more than disappointed with this travel agent. I have never experienced such a bad attitude towards customers. So sorry I have not done some research. What they did to me (or their system did that) - reversed the names of the reservation, stating that the last name was the first name and the first name became the last name. I put the names correctly but they accused me that it was my mistake. I found that out when I could not find my reservation on their strange website and did some google (some horrible reviews of this company) and tried to put my first name instead of the surname. Moreover, I called them to inform about this before receiving a second confirmation (i.e. before issuing the tickets), but they said they could do nothing (!). At first they offered to put the names in the correct order for 30 euros for each passenger and I agreed, but after 15 minutes of waiting on the phone, they said it would cost 1000 euros more!!! So finally they proposed to cancel tickets, saying it would cost 50 euros for each passenger. They did not inform me about any other additional costs. I hope I will get a refund after this ""cancellation"".Another very surprising thing was that they stated that the fee for paying with Mastercard was 24 euros something, but charged me more than 80 euros!!! This is illegal. I am seriously thinking of bringing some legal action against them. Because what they do is illegal."
"Hi Rimanteru, names are used in the same way our customers introduce them in the system during the booking code as they cannot be changed as it is an authomatic process. If you need further info, please contact us in customer.service@travel2be.com. Regards"
"They are terrible. I booked a flight today, also redirect via Skyscanner and noticed the moment it booked that I had mistaken by a month. You cannot see an overview of the flight you book right at then when you have filled out the details, and if you wanted to check at that stage you would have to start all over again. I called straight away, even before receiving the confirmation of the ticket but they insisted that they charge me their service fee for the cancellation or change to the right month. Airlines let you change or cancel for free if this happens and you call them right away. Feel really ripped off and it ruined my Christmas flight booking."
"Hi El1234567, during all the booking process is shown all the flights information and before the confirmation, everything is shown to make you see all you are booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com if you need assistance in the changes as we have to follow the ticket and airline policy for changes or cancellations. Regards"
"No, you do not see the overview at the end stage. Further, I did write to customer service and while I know that airlines do not charge in these cases where you immediately let them know. You are charging your service fees while airlines do not charge you in such a case. I asked twice already and I always get feedback that is your policy."
">>> You are charging your service fees while airlines do not charge you in such a case. I asked twice already and I always get feedback that is your policy. <<<That feedback is correct. EI1234567, when you buy tickets through a third-party agency you are subject to two lots of policies: those applied by the airline, and those of the agency through whom you are buying the tickets. They are not necessarily the same, and the agency is perfectly entitled to charge a fee for the work involved in changing a booking even if the airlines themselves choose to waive such a fee.Edited: 3 years ago "
"So they could wave it, and it is their policy to charge you, which is pretty unfair. They should not try to hide behind airline policies and show the same understanding when you call them right away and are clearly willing to book via them for the correct flight. Terrible customer service and a good reason to never use them. They were not even cheaper than the airline in the end."
"They make their money from fees, as they make very little, if anything, from flogging the tickets."
"<<No, you do not see the overview at the end stage.>>Not that I would ever use Travel2be, but to be fair to them, you do see the overview at the end stage. The full itinerary is directly above where you fill you payment details in. <<So they could wave it, and it is their policy to charge you, which is pretty unfair. >>So it's unfair for a business to try to make money and you expect them to work for free? They make their money on their admin fees. They'll make a pittance on the actual tickets, if they're lucky."

Advertising. Reported.
"No,the travel itinary is not there when you confirm if book from your phone. Maybe they should change their business model if they just make fees on not delivering service?"
I'm always interested in suggestions for different business models! What do you have in mind?
"Experienced similar deceptions. The price changes on the payment page. I didn't pay attention and got trapped. Then the ticket I bought was an open ticket, which charged me more than the airline anyway. I called, before the departure, to change the date. I was told the departure can't be changed and the return can't be changed before the departure. But the return is open and can be changed any time after the departure. A few months before the return, I called to change my return ticket. The representative said it's open, but I can only change before the departure and there's nothing he can do. I said this wasn't the company told me before and he simply hung up the phone. Probably he thinks there's nothing anyone can do to the company since there's no physical address on their webpage and god knows where he's hiding. The company and all its dealings are probably illegal."

"Skyscanner can ban them on the search result, but they don't.And the majority of people wouldn't know this Travel2be without the help of Skyscanner.Sorry Sir but Skyscanner are the one to blame. They are turning blind eye on their users being scam by these scammers. I believe they have deal, because too many people complaint about this agency, and Skyscanner is still doing business with them"
"As you said, ""looking for flights"" not for ""scammers"", so they have the power to ban travel2be(travelgenio) from their results.They are ruining their credibility by displaying such bad scammers, maybe they have monetary incentives from them, but it's just despicable that such scammers still do business with the help of Skyscanner."
Seems like Travel2be and Skyscanner have their trolls on this forum to discredit legitimate complaints.
"I think you are mistaking trolls for those who (a) have common sense and (b) point out the need to accept personal responsibility for main big stupid decisions.The truth is sometimes unpalatable, but fools who use third parties instead of booking direct and then moan about problems need to be called out for being foolish.Perhaps get a responsible adult to book tickets next time?Edited: 3 years ago "
"#40 Well another member of the Travel2be staff, you are a good employee sir!Your nonesense implies don't use Uber go for taxi, don't use Airbnb go for Sheriton and list goes on..People are complaining about bad business practices and you are trying to discredit them.Despicable but I understand that's how you put food on the table like some ladies on the street"
"Teddy, don't be so silly.Skyscanner take the revenue for these OTA's (and also Airlines) to be represented on their website, either through an annual fee or commission paid on each booking. A traveler will then choose their preferred price and select the link to click on. Skyscanner have absolutely no jurisdiction as to how these businesses operate. Yes, these OTA's are shonky and their practices are questionable, but until they either break the law continually or go out of business, these OTA's will continue to advertise on Skyscanner. However, its a vicious circle because as long as people continue to book with them, the longer they will be able to afford to advertise on Skyscanner, and continue their business. And no, I don't work for either Skyscanner or one of these OTA's. If you want your comments to be taken seriously, please dont accuse people of either working for one of these companies or being a troll."
"Hi Teddy, if you need support we will be more than pleased to check what you need in customer.service@travel2be.com. Regards"
"Hellen You just answer the question, if Skyscanner stop advertising travel2be most of the people wouldn't be victims.So Skyscanner is the key of the problem and he doesn't care about people using their website being robbed. With so many complaints against Travel2be they should just stop advertising them period, and it won't hurt them at all with all the other companies doing good business with them.It seems harmless, but these guyz can do real damages to families taking time off from work, people heading to funerals, those who already paid other expenses reated to their vacations....This matter should be taken seriously by Skyscanner cause these scumbags of Travel2be(Travelgenio) don't care about people and the way their costumer service treat people tells it all."

"Poor Teddy.If you think my comment to never use third party agents but always book direct with the airlines means I must work for third party agents, then - seriously - you shouldn't really be booking things online without it getting things checked by someone.You can't legislate against people who have no common sense and think that cheaper air fares can be plucked from the magic air ticket tree, vs. - and here's an idea - buying them from the airlinesEdited: 3 years ago "
"Teddy - Skyscanner is a business. They are there to make money. They are not responsible for the price option the traveller chooses to make and they are not responsible for the T&C's of an airline ticket whether that is through the airline directly or through an OTA. They certainly cant be held accountable because someone hasn't read the T&C's of booking through that particular channel. People do not book on Skyscanner. Plus, these shonky OTA's advertise in places other than Skyscanner."

#47 Hellen the fact that they are a business is poor excuse to display scammers that they don't really need their money.Being a Business come with responsabilties and if they are not carefull their reputaion will suffer by association.The word Ethics should mean something to them
"Teddy, it is the TRAVELERS responsibility to check the terms and conditions of the channel they are booking through. No one else. I don't know the background of your story, but I am sure as someone who - as in your words - been using third party websites for years, you are very familiar with research before booking and also the differences in T&C's. I am sure the T&C's for Travel2be were the first thing you checked before parting with your hard earned cash? A third party will have their own T&C's that need to be considered independently of the T&C's of the company they are promoting.Edited: 3 years ago "
"Trying to reason with Teddy is like trying to teach French to sparrows - he's made his mind up on all sorts of nonsense, so I reckon any more helpful posts (including book direct with the airline, read the T&Cs, be aware that all sorts of sites direct to places they don't control) will just be a waste of time."
#51 Hellen basically you are telling me Skyscanner bear no responsibilitiy as long as they put any type of BS on the fine print of the terms and conditions. That's wrong and by the way iSkyscanner can get rid of these type of scammers without hurting their business!Don't be silly you know Ethics should come first
"Teddy, as the famous expression from Dragons Den goes...........I'm Out"
"HelenSome people just cannot comprehend how it can possibly by their responsibility, and that they make themselves into victims by just going click, click, buy and not reading T&Cs. I doubt they've ever really thought about it, but if Skyscanner, or any price comparison site banned companies that had complaints there wouldn't be anyone advertising on them lol, and that includes the airlines. I think there's some trip trapping going on ;)"
>>I think there's some trip trapping going on ;) <<You are probably right :-)
"It really does beggar belief that some people can apparently have such little idea about the realities of the world. If it's not trip trapping then I despair, I really do."
Sometimes you just have to leave people to the squalor of their stupidity. And complicity in keeping garbage like this afloat. Which they never accept any responsibility for either.Edited: 3 years ago 
Trip trapping? Quick definition? I haven't heard that term before and I'm in a learning mode today.
>>>Trip trapping? Quick definition?<<<I believe it has something to do with the Norwegian fairy tale Three Billy Goats Gruff.
"The company replied to all the complaint by asking everyone to contact their customer service. It sounds like they are willing find a solution. No they don't. They did reply to my email, but insisted on their nonsense interpretation of the fact. The only way to nail this scammer down is to report to government agencies and sue them. I'd recommend everyone to report them to fair trade commission 'https://www.ftc.gov/' first."

I sent an email to Travel2Be asking them to help me select my seats since I was not given the option during booking. I get a response asking for $20 EURO per person to ATTEMPT at requesting seats. This is a non-refundable fee that does not guarantee that we get the seats at all. Absolutely ridiculous for them to even ask us to pay additional costs for something that is free and should be part of their service.I went to the airline's site and was able to select my seats in under 2 minutes for FREE.I highly suggest that everyone avoid using this company's services.
"""I sent an email to Travel2Be asking them to help me select my seat""---You asked them to provide a service and complain when they tell you there's a fee? Wasn't it you who chose to book with them, so you accepted whatever terms and conditions are provided. Do you feel your post will be helpful to others? You didn't do any research first did you?"

"I was also directed from sky scanner app. Went through the booking process, entered passport info, name, address and credit card info. I then hit submit. Nothing happened. I was redirected to the page where you select your flights. No confirmation email nada! I then called the customer service number. A million prompts to get you where you need to be. I immediately felt like this was something SKETCHY! When someone finally came on the line he asked me for my email to see if I had a reservation. I gave it to him he said he found nothing. He then asked for the first 6 digits of my cc. I hesitantly gave it to him. Again he said no reservations found. He then asked for the last 4 digits of my cc. I asked why?! He said because millions of people have the same prefix numbers as me for my credit card. I said I didn't feel comfortable giving that info since he already had the first 6 digits. He said it was the only way he could look up my reservation. I asked why he couldn't look it up by my name and he said only with cc info. So I again hesitantly gave him the last 4 numbers of my cc. He still couldn't find reservation. I asked if I could have an email sent to me confirming that I have no reservation. He said he couldn't do that. Said I could check with my bank but that's about it. I feel very uneasy about this whole situation and will be contatpcting my bank to put a flag on my card just to be safe! I recommend NOT USING THIS WEBSITE! Sky scanner should also be more careful as to who they direct you to!!!"

"Customers! This mess is a bit long, but please read. It could save you headache and frustrations at the end. Similar thing happened to me when though it was a great deal in purchase an ""Open-date ticket"" with additional $109. At the end we end up paying the airline additional for changing our return flight. It is misleading from Travel2be. The Open-date ticket packet deal as advertising states, "" Your tike doesn't all changes? Don't worry! We guarantee that you always travel when you want. All types of Date Changes, including: OUTGOING FLIGHT, INCOMING FLIGHT, RETURN FLIGHT, 1 FLIGHT SEGMENT , AND VARIOU FLIGHT SEGMENTTS. NO rate restrictions, NO administration fees.""We decided to purchase seem to be the right service packet deal because we might have unforeseen circumstances that we might encounter for our return flight. When we called in to ask for flight change on our return flight, Travel2be stated that it cannot be modified. Terms and Conditions after you purchased misleading is that one statement states, "" Any changes to you booking must be made within the office hours of our customer services, and a minimum of 48 hours before the scheduled departure.""We called in to request the change of return flight one week before scheduled flight. Then again, Travel2be state if they do make changes we would have to pay additional fee (administration fee) plus the different of the airline would change for changes. Open-date ticket misleading advertisement:1. guarantee all types of date changes2. out/incoming flight adjustment3. 1 flight segment4. various flight segments5. No rate restrictions6. No administration feesYou do not get the terms and conditions until you purchased the open-date ticket. As for me it is not about the money but fair business practices that service to the customers. When businesses intentionally misleading customers so they can gain profit is unfair business practice. In my 30 years plus working and living oversea and travel around the world, I never have experienced this kind of unfair business practice. Consumers, be aware of this kind of business practices."

"I have been traveling now for 3 years and have been booking flights online through different companies quite a fair amount of time and I just had the worst experience with Travel2Be. First as someone mentionned above, the final price was different than the original price (which happens a lot with online travel agencies I have agree).Then I booked the flight through their website, gave my debit card details and made the paiement. I received an email a few minutes later litterally saying: ""Your booking is confirmed and your tickets are being processed. Once your credit card has been charged you will receive a second email with your electronic ticket (please remember to check your spam folder). As soon as you receive the second email, you are ready to travel. Please take note of your booking codes: ...""Thinking that I will receive the second email shortly, I turn off my computer and go to work. 10 hours later I come back from work, check my emails and see that I had received a 2nd email from Travel2Be 20 minutes after the first one saying:""Following our security policies and given the nature of your trip, we will only accept payment through 3D Secure (Verified by Visa/MasterCard SecureCode).This payment method is 100% secure and it ensures that the person using the card is the card owner. 3D Secure method guarantees that no one uses your card without your permission.3D payment method connects the client with the bank, so that the bank may authenticate the purchase. If you have further doubts please contact your bank entity.Once the payment is confirmed, we will issue your electronic tickets and we will send them to you per e-mail.IMPORTANT: Bear in mind that the fare is only guaranteed for today (11:59PM GMT+2) and therefore, we suggest you make the payment as early as possible to avoid any change in your booking.""First I am surprised that the first email didn't mention any additional step/security check. I call my bank to check that the method is legit and then proceed with the paiement (giving my card detail again to the same company for the second time). It doesn't go through so I call Travel2Be and they tell me that since it is now a new day (2 am when I got back from work) the rate has now gone up and I need to pay an additionnal $12... I explain that I'm not happy about it since the first email never mentionned such thing but still willing to book as I don't have many more options. So I proceed with the paiement, I can see that my bank account is being debited but doesn't receive any email with flight tickets. I call them and explain the whole situation again, then the call just gets cancelled. I call them again asking them to make sure to call me back in case that happens again and the lady says ""no we don't do that"". Anyway I explain my story again and ask them when I am supposed to receive my flight tickets. She tells me I have to wait a few hours (at that time, it is 4am in the morning and I was supposed to get them about 11 hours ago according to their first email. So I am asking her if there is any way she can speed up the process as I am really upset with the experience I am having with them right now. She says ""no you have to wait"" and pretty much hang up on me.It is now 4:21am and I still havn't receive anything. Hopefully I will, but even if I do, I will never use their service ever again. Worst. Customer service. Ever..."

Thank you very much for your post!! We were trying to understand why the price went 60eur up when we started the payment! It was driving us insane!

"I bought a Brisbane-Bali flight from Skyscanner and chose the Travel2be offer because it was the cheapest one. I started the payment process and up to the last step the price was one (€ 191) but at the end of the purchase it went up to € 213. Finally, the bank charges further Australian $9.45 (I paid from an Australian account) for ""International Transaction Fees"". As a result, a ticket that costs AU$ 284, in the end cost me $40 more (= 324), by counting the increase and international fees. I do not know if it was written somewhere (in any case on the cell phone it's all really very small) and I was definitely naive not to check on the internet reviews about the agency, but surely, as per the way the transaction took place, I can safely say that this agency works in a bad faith. So I vively advise you against it."
"Yes, Diego, I'm afraid that you have made some mistakes. Don't use any company without checking them out first, don't proceed with anything that isn't absolutely clear (I won't do anything like this on a phone!) and don't expect others to heed your warning!"

"Travelgenio. You are you have now racked up almost a thousand posts on here so presumably that's 1000 unhappy customers you've told ""Of course we can help with......""!!! Good going!!!"
"I have started reporting the TravelGenio postings as ""duplicate posts"" since it's basically the same canned response over and over.-JimG"
"I say leave them stand, JimG because as Traveller says, they aren't helping the company at all :-)"
"Diego,While I agree that T2b are a poor company to do business with, you cannot blame them for AU$9.45 as it is your bank who have charged that. If considering buying from or travelling to overseas destinations get yourself a credit card that does not charge overseas transaction fees, like 28 Degrees Mastercard or BankWest Platinum Mastercard."
"Just had precisely the same experience with Travel2be. Attracted by some very competitively-priced tickets for London > Denver next year ('18) and got all the way to the payment stage before it was made apparent that unless I could pay with a Maestro card, there would be a £105 charge - even for paying with my Visa debit card!! Phoned the customer service number and excplained that I could pay with a MasterCard, Visa (credit and debit card) or Amex, but that I did not have a Maesto (which I'm guessing is not unusual, which is precisely why they've made paying by Maestro the only free option). A very, very slippery way to do business..."

"Greg,God for you, that you spotted these details.Too often, folk just click past, in a rush to buy.Good work, and good luck,Hunt"
"It is better not to mess with this service !!! In Google's results the ticket on Travel2be was cheaper than all with the price of 530 dollars, after the click the price was already 530.99, after the click to pay - already 531.74 and when choosing some cards the price was already 551.74. Specially chose the AmExpress card, so that the price would remain at 531.74. The first time the payment went wrong, filled out again and paid. BUT! Have charged 551.74, i.е. $20 more! In contacts page for communication are listed Spanish phone numbers and one, incomprehensible, Google says that this is Canada. When you call him, nevertheless New York is displayed, i chosen a connection with the operator, music is constantly playing, 5-10 minutes and resets. With a specialist and could not talk. There are no e-mail addresses on the site, there is no possibility to leave a message. Terrible service!"

"First time i used this Service.I booked ticket for X euro. However i had issues with my card.I called serive and i was told that i can pay later, however if the price change i will need to pay for latest price. Next day when i made Transition, the price of flight dropped 15 euro. I was happy that i saved those money, until i have not looked at my account. Travel 2be booked also those 15 euro difference!From one side they inform you that if price change you need to pay for latest offer, yet later if price drop they take the difference. Its typical double standards.Extra, you see one price and then at booking you receive next much hires price. There is no clear Information anywhere why they charge you extra. Not happy and will not use it again.Edited: 2 years ago "

"I had a very bad experience with Travel2be. I had to cancel a ticket due to medical conditions that I booked with Travel2Be, and the airlines said it was refundable with a 15% fee. Travel2be invented that their policy was non-refundable and refused to refund me, telling me to have the airlines put a note in the system. When I called the airlines they said there is no actual way to do that. Travel2be is a deceptive travel agency that is not providing service to customers, just taking the booking and inventing false policies so they don't have to refund you."

"I already spent an hour on the phone with you guys. The agent insisted that her screen told her that the airlines charged a $150 fee, but the actual airlines says that is not true. They don't charge that. They don't specify ""no show"" as a reason not to refund. You guys invented that. It could be easily resolved by you talking to the airlines and fixing your erroneous information in the screen that the agent is using. I asked the agent to fix the problem by calling the airlines but she said you do not offer that service and insisted that there was no solution, that the ticket would not be refunded. The airline itself did not impose that restriction, YOUR company did. Not cool."
"""They don't specify ""no show"" as a reason not to refund""---Jen, which airline are you referring to and what ticket type did you possess? Did you just 'no show' for a flight and expect a refund?"
Please send us all the info to the mail before told in order to check your case and contact you back. Thanks in advance. Regards
I just booked a trip with travel2be.com (alias travelgenio) via Momondo. I was in a hurry so I did not want to check for another option but it is also the last time I book with them until they stop this scamming thing of adding a 30€ of additional charge because you pay with a card other than maestro.
"I am sorry, not 30€ but 17,90 € of additional charge on a 282€ ticket. But still, my point remains the same."
"Well if all you end up losing is €17.90 for rushing and not taking time to check out whom you were buying from, you’ll be doing better than a lot of their customers.So still cheaper than booking direct?"
"Yes my total of about 300€ was still cheaper of 20€ than booking with the airline (320€) . That's the only other option I checked. BUT and that is a very BIG BUT as far as I am concerned, I won't use travel2be again because that practice of adding additional fees at the last step is deceiving. And I don't want to worry about how much these fees will actually be when I decided that the aforementioned price was ok with me ... and possibly then feeling conned and needing to make another search.And actually, if I hadn't be in a hurry, I would have booked with the more expensive airline instead of travel2be because their price is consistent.Ryanair did exactly that for some time: additional fees were added because you paid with a regular credit card and could be avoided only with one very specific card nobody has ever heard of. But today, even them stopped this practice. This is a true repellent. I created a tripadvisor account specifically to comment about this since it pisses me off a great deal.travel2be/travelgenio, please stop doing business like this. It may be ok for you now but in the long run that won't work.CheersR.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Stay away from this corrupt company... I bought a ticket and get another ticket, a cheaper ticket with one stay over night. If I want back my original ordered ticket I had to pay extra 230 euro for the change. They speculate in this... send you a different cheaper tickets and wait for you to change it and then charge you for 230 euros if you want to change the ticket. I spoke with KLM and they were shocked and will take contact with Travel2Be!STAY AWAY FROM TRAVEL2BE!!!"

They refused to give me all the information so I could make an informed decision, and one of them ended up abusing me and hanging up.Spend the extra few dollars and book direct with the airline, these guys are not worth saving $20 with the hassle they'll cause you."

"I have just spent an infuriating 2 days trying to get some information on my ticket. I booked business class through Malaysia Airlines Chiang Mai/Bangkok/Kuala Lumpur/Melbourne using travel2be.com through Momondo. Got an email confirming the business class booking. Then got a phone call a couple of days later saying that Business Class was no longer available. Checked with Malaysia Airlines to find that Business Class seats were available but that I had been booked Economy despite paying for Business Class.I have sent numerous emails without getting a reply, and attempted numerous phone calls to be told that the waiting time was 4 minutes at the end of which the call was terminated. The best I can do now is to attempt to get my money back as it seriously looks like a scam."

After a fruitless couple of days and with time running out, I decided to rebook which I did on the Thai website and got a Business booking without layovers and for AUD400 cheaper. I have to say I got a last minute email and very courteous and professional phone call from a Travel2Be lady representative saying that they had managed to find me a business class booking. I informed them that in view of the delays I wanted to cancel the booking and a full refund. I confirmed this by email and have had email confirmation from Travel2Be that this will happen. I will report when I get my refund"

"TOTALLY SCAMMED BY THIS COMPANY!!I wish I had read your post before I booked an air ticket with them! I purchased some ""extra bundle"" that I thought included seats and a pi ece of luggage. What I heard from them was asking me for MORE MONEY to get those things. Their explanation: the fee was to ""manage"" my booking, ie. go to the airlines website and choose a seat for me, but only by charging me for the seat!! Wait, what?! Then the booking reference they gave me was incorrect, so I couldn't select (and pay for) the seats myself. (They sent me the correct one).Of course, they REFUSED to refund my money and sent me a link to their terms! The problem is that their website trades in MISLEADING and DECEPTIVE advertising (for which I am sure they could be sued). I even told them I was an attorney, but frankly I don't have the time, or the resources, to sue them! But I will NEVER use them again, and will tell anyone I can to avoid doing the same!!!Spread the word, these people are CROOKS!!"
"You claim to be an attorney, yet state you're sure they could be sued over their T&C's - but don't have the time or resources?"

"Travel2be booking process is indeed with ""cheat' logic carefully planted.My claim is bold as it is, but shame I paid USD282.08 for nothing.Chronology of the event.1. I placed a booking, it showed payment status successful but booking status = pending.2. Few hours later - I check the website status again, the status of booking is cancelled.3. Due to urgency I proceed to book another airline. And request travel2be to arrange for refund.4. Late in the evening, I received emailed saying the booking went thru.Travel2be refused to entertain my request for cancel, instead asking for another 75euro to process for refund.I don't ask for everyone to believe me - and I am not here to waste my time either doing damage. But this travel2be best to avoid."

"I, too, am a victim of this Spanish scam. This is my sorry tale: made a booking at the listed price (also reconnected from Skyscanner) and then when it came to the checkout, £20 was added (despite paying with a debit card, which should be without fees). Unfortunately, I'd already clicked confirmed and so was taken to a page where the payment process became frozen. Tried to get in touch with the company: there is no email address and only phone numbers in Spain (and one in France, I believe), When I finally spoke to someone, he said that there was a problem with my card. When I told him to forget about the whole thing, he said I owed at least 30- euros per passenger as a cancellation fee, or even the full price of the tickets. I asked him how there could be a cancellation fee if, as he confirmed, the booking had not gone through because of the payment issue. One last thing; I contacted my bank and they confirmed that there was nothing wrong with my card. Who knows what other shenanigans these scammers are trying to pull. AVOID AT ALL COST!"

"One of the travel agencies that skyscanner found for me and redirected me to, is a scamming company with not transparent business practices. Travel2be or travegenio has charged me higher fee ($35) than I approved claiming that I didn't use Maestro card, but there was no information on the website about the requirement. They refuse to acknowledge the claim. I have been researching the company after I encountered the problem and this scam has been happening for at least 2 years and there are hundreds of claims and negative reviews with the exactly same experience. I filed a complaint with European Consumer Center. On top of that there is no disclaimer about international fees when making booking."

"linijka, Skyscanner found a set of adverts rather than travel agencies, and you chose which one to go and follow up. You weren't redirected anywhere against your will. It's useful to research a company before using them, rather than wiating until you;ve had problems.Had you done this, you most probably would never have given them your money."
"<<there was no information on the website>> Below is written in the T&C's:<<Travel2be charges a service fee per passenger as well as a fee for credit card payments. This fee is not refundable under any circumstances>> Source: …travel2be.com/pages/travel2be-terms-and-con…<<redirected me to>> No, Skyscanner does not send you anywhere. You have to click on a link to go there.I am sorry, but if you click any link, do not read T&C's, and most importantly do not check with whom you are entering business with before you hand over a (larger) amount of money, then with paying only USD 35 you came away lightly."
"This place is a scam. I am on the phone now, with ""customer service"" who repeatedly keeps calling me 'lady' when my name is right in front of him. I am attempting to cancel a trip I booked just 30 minutes ago.

"I just spoke with someone who informed me I would be charged 30 Euro per person (again despite this being a one time charge as opposed to 2 separate payments). I'm not sure what else I can say that wasn't just reported in my previous post. Charging a 'cancellation fee' within 30 minutes of booking is absurd, any other agency or airline would give full refund no charge within 24 hours. Also I'm not sure why it's in Euro's given the fact that I am traveling intracontinential, not internationally. Horrible customer service, and a completely untrustworthy company."
"""Most airlines have a 24 hour cancellation policy.""Yep, in the US it is law, but you did not book with an airline, did you."

"I can totally relate to the bad reviews for Travel2be, those are exactly what I'm experiencing, and thank god that I didn't proceed with my payment yet. The way the website works is like a trap for customers to fall into for hidden fees, like additional credit card fees that is not transparent. Behavior I'm noticing on the site as I'm trying to book my ticket: 1) As for personal contact details there are field titles 'Name' and 'First Name' after each other (First Name field is actually Surname here), which is a mistake. This mistake has been made aware of in the reviews but the agent doesn't seem to want to fix this confusion that it creates, so perhaps this is to be able to charge customers who have put in their full name reversed. 2) On the last step to add payment method, I pick my credit card type and adds in the details, and as I'm completing the rest of my details, it suddenly jacks up my initial price with +45 eur due to the payment method, which is not shown immediately after choosing the card type, and it's completely not noticeable when this fee was applied if you don't pay attention to the sudden change! Only by choosing Maestro, you don't get charged extra. So basically, the discounted ticket price that drives people to this website is ONLY applicable for Maestro card holders and is completely misleading. They are completely not transparent with the pricing from the beginning, and of course all of these are tactics from their side, which is very sneaky. This is the most unsatisfying process I've gone through to booking a ticket from any website, the WORST user experience. I don't recommend booking from this site.Edited: 2 years ago "

Siyu. Please of not book with this company. You seem to have had a lucky escape. Now book directly with the airline.
not sure who was running the scam but saw their flight information on Momondo. Was directed to Travel2be for booking and payment. when I got there the price had increased substancially and the flight was no longer business class all the way. Some of the legs had been switched to economy which should had lowered the price not increased it. Just lucky to saw this before I pulled the trigger! absolutely BUYER BEWARE!

"Hello, There is no serious action taken by your team despite your reply.I have been chasing with emails, sent to your support team nothing but useless and ridiculous reply and waste of time.Can you just take whatever fee you think you deserve (yes, I'm giving you money for your system error/glitch despite my effort to tell you it's your system glitch and error in the booking), and refund me the balance.Give me email address or contact number."
"Dear Tonny, without identifying from here your booking we cannot check what happened. Please send your details to our customer.service@travel2be.com mail or send us a private message with the booking details. We will ask about it. Regards"
I had much much worse experience with them. They quoted something very different amount to me and charged me another amount on my credit card. Even their invoice had their quoted amount. When I tried to dispute the charges they cancelled my tickets and charged me a heavy cancellation fee. The customer service agent was rude and these guys can;t be trusting.
"Hi Rohankothari, Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"No Travelgenio, you can't help me. I already have gone through your process from every angle, email, twitter, calls. Despite accepting your mistake you chose to leave me stranded at the airport without a ticket. Please stop sending your system template message."
Without identifying your booking we cannot see your case in detail. Please write to the mail providen or provide us your booking code. Regards
Unfortunately I booked a flight with these guys as well... They aren't reacting to my emails or Twitter messages anymore. Did it work out for anyone? I'm just thinking I should take my losses and buy a new flight to prevent the surprise on the airport that it was canceled like with other persons here...

"The same thing happened to me with a flight I booked to Dublin on Travel2be. I had to cancel, and Norwegian airline’s policy was free cancellation within 24 hours, which I confirmed with the airline. Travel2be refused to call the airline to go through with the cancellation. I disputed the charge and now they are threatening to go after me with legal action. DO NOT USE THEM !!!! Worst customer service of all time"
"This is EXACTLY what happened to me with a flight that I had to cancel within 24 hours. I called multiple times and confirmed with the airline that it was indeed free and possible, but that I had to get the agency to call in and they would walk them through the cancellation. I called Travel2be multiple times during the day and their response was always simply that the fare was non refundable or that they couldn’t call the airline. They finally relented and “said” they would “call the airline”...hours later (an hour before the 24 hour mark) they call back and say they couldn’t cancel it with the airline. (Complete BS because I had had to cancel another Norwegian air flight I booked with another travel agency and it was done without a problem). Better yet, I ended up disputing the charge with my bank, and now a week later I get a demand for payment that they will go after me with LEGAL action for the “service” they provided me. ARE YOU F-ING KIDDING ME, Travel2be?? Worst customer experience of my lifetime"

"@ #221 & #222,It does not matter that the airline policy, or the regulations in the US relating to airlines, might provide for 24 hour cancellation, you used a third party who have their OWN terms and conditions."
"When I booked and read this forum I got really scared that it was all a scam. I also was charged a higher price than I originally agreed to, but they refunded this to me after one complaint by email, maybe I was lucky, maybe they increased their service... I was worried that my flight turned out not to be booked, but today I had a pleasant flight with Copa. I felt I needed to share this as all the stories here consist of complaints and bad stories."
Sjoerd21 thanks for your rating your experience with our services. We hope to see you soon again in our web. Regards
just keep everybody informed about my case. I made screen shot of agreed price and currency (HKD); and finally they charged me 200EUR more and claim the transaction was correct. This is the funniest company I ever experienced.

This is a horrible site to buy tickets. I bought the tickets and payed for my seats on fours flights. They changed my flight and didn`t give me the seats that I payed for ( next to the window). When you call there they put you to hold on line and wait for more than 5 minutes each time (payed called). Worse experience ever! NEVER BUY HERE!

Suliafridi. You joined Trip Advisor today. You found the Air Travel forum but seem to think you are speaking to Travel2be? Surely what you need to do is get in touch with them by phone or email?

"Never again. The line does not work. I had confirmations details a two months ago and then a few days before the flight, they have sent me an email about that my payment was refused and I have to pay extra money. Those flights are through Iberia but those guys have told me that I have talked to ravel2be. Like really?"
"Like really? Yes. You chose to book with a third party, so that is who you have to deal with."
I don't mind to talk to them if the line would be working.

melodygayle. You have had a very lucky escape. Now just book directly with the airline and save yourself a lot of grief!!!
I'm currently finding Travel2be a nightmare. Payment has been processed but tickets still haven't been issued. Tried to call customer service twice and each time after holding for 10min I get disconnected after an automated voice tells me to rate my call! So frustrating.
Yes they are so cheater and their service is really cheating. Don’t trust them. They put price on website but they charge much more in the end. And people in customer service are so rude. I don’t understand there is like this bad company in this world. Plz you should check before you buy ticket from them. Because I don’t want to see any victims anymore.

>> I cancelled already and they said the penalties is €221 which is unbelievable. <<I assume this was not a refundable ticket...what were the fare rules?...are you applying for a refund of the refundable taxes (less the agents admin fee?)....
Hi Kazuyo. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration.
No they said this is refoundable and I need pay penalties €220. I called them many times and 2-3 people said same price €220.Otherwise you should hear the recorder of our conversation which you always record.
Penalties depend on airline rules and admin fees. They will inform you by mail. Regards
I want it as soon as possible Because you guys always say you will email me in few hours and it’s always not true and it’s like forever thing.Please do properly what you say.
"Kazuyo, if the staff are rude and tell lies about contacting you, do you think it's possible that they may also have lied to you about the refund?"
Yea thanks that’s what I am worried about. They said they will refund me but they might not. Because so far I can’t trust this company as everyone said same.
I wouldn't trust them. Even their responses here just demonstrate how poor they are.
"Unfortunately, this is what can happen when you don't check companies out before you hand your money over. I am sympathjetic to victims of these terrible companies, but you have to take some responsibility, learn from the experience, and make sure you never make the same mistake again. I've made some mistakes in my time, but never the same one twice."
"The answer is that too many people do nexactly the same as you, and only find out how poor a company is when it's too late. If everyone did the proper research, and avoided those third parties with poor reputations, outfits like Travel2be would last five minutes, if that.I don't want to see any more victims either, but I'm as powerless to achieve that as I am to bring about world peace."
Very bad experience with travel2be. They are clearly scammers. I booked a ticket and a few hours after I paid (it already showed as deducted) they contact me and tell me the price is higher now. If I do not pay extra money they will cancel my ticket! I sent them several emails but only got come copy&paste answers not even related to my email. Then I called and after a really long time in wait I was connected to a representative that wasn't even capable to understand English. It seems my ticket was canceled now and I hope I will at least get back what I paid. Either way I lost money since prices are up now. Stay far far away from this company. I feel they should get sued! But it's not worth the hassle.
"Hi thias15, of course we can help you with your booking doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all the flights info and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"Prices aren't up in reality, since the fare you saw was probably never available at the time you made a booking request. And that's another thing to remember, apart form the fact that rubbish companies don't have live pricing. You didn't make a booking at all. You asked them to make a booking, and it's at that point and that point only that they actually discovered how much the flight would cost."
thias15. It doesn't sound as if you know how third parties work? They did exactly what you could have done yourself.They phoned up the airline and made the booking for you. They were then told the price of the ticket...which of course was more expensive than quoted on Travel2be's website.They then passed the extra cost onto you.Edited: 2 years ago 
"Yes, I guess you are new to air trave or a very irregular and inexperienced flyer, thias. What Travel2be do is very common. Most booking sites work this way. It's just one fo the reaosns why I avoid them completely and book directly with the airlines."
"I just booked 2 flights today, got my email confirmation of the booking.One hour and a half later, at night time, I receive an email stating my payment was rejected probably due to credit card limit or lack of money, suggesting I contact my bank OR try to complete the payment using another card through a link.I go to the link, give another credit card (checking before that it has no credit card limit and has more than sufficient money for that particular payment).My online bank's gateway gives NO ERROR, it asks my login and my coordinate numbers specific to that transaction alone. It all goes through without a problem, as usual. Then, Travel2Be page shows again an error, saying the payment was rejected by payment gateways. No further details.Since there is really no online support with this company, I look for an email address on Google, and I landed here and found that custmer support email. I sent an email.However, it was almost midnight here in Spain and the email I received by this company said the fee of my booking would not be guaranteed past the same day I made the booking. Which is beyond unfair.SO i went to Travel2Be website and called the support number there. An employee from Urugay's call center takes my call and helps me NOT...like nothing at all. He insists that there is a problem with the payment and the only solution is either I call the bank to ask permision for the payment...what a stupid thing!! my bank does not need me to call them to verify a transaction. No bank operates that way these days, its damn 2018!!. Second option was to try to pay again through the link (I told the staff that I did that already, but he did not seem to care much). And his third option was I give him the 4 last digits of my credit card for him to try to do the payment from there. I did, gave the last 4 digits of both used credit cards. Nothing.Not content with that, he informs me that indeed some amoiunt has been charged to my credit card but not the entire payment, reason why my booking is rejected and I have to make a new booking. So..what happens with the money you have charged already??? Are you for real???Also, I told him several times that I cannot call a bank on a Sunday at midnight and he repeated himself that he is giving me solutions like calling my bank.Not to mention he was beyond rude as if the problem was with me or the bank, when the problem is clearly with the payment system of this company.Finally,I asked his name in order to present a formal complaint. He refused to give me his name.I said Im entitled to do so, but he refused again.So I asked him to send via email the recorded conversation we had, since by law the calls are recorded and both parties can ask for it at any given time. Lets see when i will receive it...its been 30 minutes form the call and I still havent.Probably never willTRAVEL2BE you better fix this mess...apparently you have some good experience in having to fix your mess.."
"Hi merrygcdm, of course we can help you with your booking payment process. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"merry, it's highly likely that the fare you saw and wanted was never going to be available. There is no problem with your card at all. Saying that there is just allows the company not to reveal to you that they don't have live pricing, and to pretend that the price has gone up because of the delay in processing your payment."
"buyer beware buyer beware buyer beware travel2be is a scam,i bought a ticket from them,they advertised if i want to buy flexible ticket to pay extra money which i did, i call them for over a month for them to change the ticket for me but everytime they cut off my call. i also sent them an email they refused to respond to my email there customer service number has incurred me a lot of charges since the time that i have been calling themthey are fraudstar.they collect money from me but they are not offering the services they collect money for"

"Hi Guys, how do we tackle this company that is obviously out to scam people yet get away with everything just because their customer service people plays the ""rude"" and ""nothing can be done"" card. I booked tickets to Tokyo and vividly remember I tick yes to paying SGD1,300 odd. and the next page I got directed to, I saw I paid for SGD1,400. I sent a few emails to the customer service people and all they did were reply the standard, you paid for what you ticked yes to. I wished I took a print screen of what I ticked yes to but I didn't. Is this something I can take up with the bank? I am happy to pay but not to scam websites that places things in fine prints just to get a few extra hundred bucks."
Hi Jamie of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. RegardsEdited: 2 years ago 
"Hi Travelgenio, I think it is counter-effective to pretend you're willing to help with your consumers'' predicaments just by replying that template response everytime we try to raise an issue on TripAdvisor. Just for other users' benefits, they are not willing to help at all. All they will reply is a ""you ticked to the terms and conditions provided"". My situation was a clear ticking to a SGD1,300 odd transaction and then being re-directed to a payment page with a different value where payment was already verified. I'll be calling up my bank tomorrow just to understand how banks deal with scammers like these."
"Jamie, the question for me is whether you can provide supporting evidence to your bank about agreeing to pay one amount, and actually being charged a higher sum.If you can, then you have a much better chance of getting soemthign done, but perhaps Travel2BE/Travelgenio will be able to satisfy the bank that the additional sum were extra charges that were notified to you elsewhere? Or that they were foreign transaction charges? I don't know, I'm no expert on what happens as I only book with the airlines.Good luck, though, and please keep us updated as to what happens."
"Hi RojBlake,Yes that makes sense. I'll be doing that. I think most users just get tired of going back and forth on this topic that they give up but I really don't think shoving things in fine prints, blaming users for not reading thoroughly enough is the way to go to earn an extra couple of bucks. any further suggestions to deal with this fraudulent operator are highly welcomed."
"I can't think of anything else. If I were in your shoes, I'd be contacting my bank asap. Like I say, I can't guarantee that they will be able to do anything to help, but it's worth a try. I commend you for not giving up."
"Jamie W, could you tell us your booking code to check the final amount you authorised and contact you back? Regards"
"Travelgenio/Travel2be, your website works solely on deception and misleading information so as to cheat a few extra bucks out from consumers. It surprises me how cooperative you appear to be on tripadvisor yet it is another story via emails and calls. to all users out there, i'm still checking with my bank and cyber security associate of my country to see how we can prevent further users from being conned by this website. Will update you guys."
"'I booked tickets to Tokyo and vividly remember I tick yes to paying SGD1,300 odd. and the next page I got directed to, I saw I paid for SGD1,400.' The difference may have been travel2be / travelgenio's service fee for making the booking or it may have been that the website does not have live pricing, or possibly a mix of both.'to all users out there, i'm still checking with my bank and cyber security associate of my country to see how we can prevent further users from being conned by this website. Will update you guys.'No need to wait for an update and certainly no reason to contact any 'cyber security associate'. In order to avoid paying a fee for service (which the website will have indicated) and the aggravation of not being offered live prices then don't use these less than stellar third party booking sites.That's it. Instead of believing what's advertised, spend five minutes and make a dummy booking with the airline. If the fare is substantially different from the price shown at Cheapforareason.com then that fare isn't likely to be available, so don't even bother with the website. It's really not that diffcult."
"I think you're missing the point here. This is a matter of how consumers can guard themselves against such scam sites..Nobody's going to know travel2be is a ""less than stella third party booking sites"" unless its website has a plain dodgy interface. And it is a fact that such websites are still being used rather than direct websites in hope of securing a cheaper fare for some. If it is not an obvious case that such websites are out to scam people then the point here would really be to flag it out, restrict their traffic flow so less consumers can be directed to them. In the best case scenario, get it shut down completely. it's really not that difficult to understand."
"""This is a matter of how consumers can guard themselves against such scam sites""FFS all that is needed is a 2 minute Google search for ""Reviews travel2be"" and also reading their T&C's. It is not hard, and it is you who are missing the point and just going click, click, buy."
"<<I think you're missing the point here.This is a matter of how consumers can guard themselves against such scam sites..Nobody's going to know travel2be is a ""less than stella third party booking sites"" unless its website has a plain dodgy interface.>>Jamie.I don't think anyone is missing the point here.If people looking to book a flight stop for one moment and do some research on the company they are planning to give their money to, they'll find lots of comments that do indeed show that they are 'less than stellar third party booking sites'.THAT's how consumers can guard themselves against such 'scam' sites.A quick Google of Travel2be brings up Trustpilot with poor reviews and a couple of Tripadvisor threads that should have you running for the hills with your credit card tucked firmly in your back pocket.And THAT's really not that difficult to understand."
"Jamie, without identifying your booking we cannot check the booking process you made. Could you please send us a private message with the info? Thanks"
"hi users, it's quite apparent now my replies have attracted the usual trolls who discredit and abash people who came on this thread to raise their concerns. Focus should be on the organisation itself, not the end consumer. Users are smarter now at reading terms and conditions (and not ""click click buy"" ..haha at that assumption) but scammers are also getting smarter at providing unclear and misleading terms and conditions. Reviews can also be flagged out but unfortunately also thwarted by trolls who side those scammers and lead consumers out there into forming an undecided impression. anyhow users, i will end by saying you can raise a case. If you do feel unjustified and that the site is truly misleading for purpose of getting a few extra bucks, raise it to skyscanner, raise it to your bank. I've got a good few cases going on and they do treat it very seriously. good luck all."
"'If it is not an obvious case that such websites are out to scam people' They are not out to 'scam' people. As with a great many other businesses, their terms and conditions are weighted in their favour, after-purchase care is not a strong suit, and they do indicate that they charge fees for using their (awful) services.'then the point here would really be to flag it out, restrict their traffic flow so less consumers can be directed to them. In the best case scenario, get it shut down completely.' No. As soon as someone starts to determine what one can and cannot view, that's the first step on a slippery slope I do not want to contemplate.Instead, consumers need to take much more responsibility for where they spend their money. Crying foul when one has made no effort to perform due diligence won't be of benefit. The only way to put a dent in the operations of these companies is to greatly reduce their income - by not using them."
"""scammers are also getting smarter at providing unclear and misleading terms and conditions""Then if the terms are not clear surely you run to the hills and dont book with them !"
"My starting point is that only one person truly has my best interests at the heart of what they do and that is me. All commercial entities exist to make money. Some may do it in a reputable way and treat their customers fairly, some don’t. Some work a low cost model where service is minimal and costs extra. I know I can’t expect much help from the latter. The clue is price. If they are selling something at the same price or cheaper than the actual provider (in this case, the airline) then chances I’m going to be paying extra for service if I can manage to get it.I’m more than happy to protect myself by doing a few minutes research on a company before I appoint them to act for me and read what the terms are of what I’m buying (what luggage is and isn’t included, seat selection, cancellation or change fees and conditions etc). I do not need a “Nanny State” doing this for me, reducing choice and no doubt driving up prices.I’m not excusing poor companies but we have to take personal responsibility for our actions or inactions. If I book a non refundable ticket for the wrong date by accident, that’s down to me and I pay the price.Too many who come on here screaming “scam”are too blindly trusting that every company is great online, they will get great service and get a cheap price and be dealing with someone reliable. It’s inevitable with this approach to online buying that they will end up buying something unsuitable, get bad service and lose money. It is of course their money and time to lose.For me, spending 5 or 10 minutes (or longer for an expensive trip) before buying is far better than spending hours after the event trying to get redress against a contract I didn’t bother to read."
"<<hi users, it's quite apparent now my replies have attracted the usual trolls who discredit and abash people who came on this thread to raise their concerns. >>Oh dear, Jamie.Just because people have pointed out that you've been pretty silly with your money by booking with one of these websites doesn't make them trolls.They're just telling the truth - which you don't want to hear.<<Reviews can also be flagged out but unfortunately also thwarted by trolls who side those scammers and lead consumers out there into forming an undecided impression. >>You didn't see the reviews because you didn't check them out.""Thwarted by trolls""?Don't be silly.A quick Google for 'Travel2be reviews' shows this thread:https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g1-i…What part of ""Travel2be Review - Buyer beware!"" (that's the title) would ANYBODY not understand?Edited: 2 years ago "
"Focus should be on the organisation itself, not the end consumer.Completely disagree. I think this is a very dangerous way of thinking actually. The focus should be on educating the consumer that ALL sketchy 3rd party sellers are bad, not just Travelgenio, and that one should book directly with the airline. By focusing on one organization, it’s like you’re not able to see the forest for the trees. While you beat the drum hear to avoid Travelgenio and someone else does the same in the eDreams thread and another does the same in the Kiwi thread, it’s like, don’t you all see the bigger picture here?"
"<<The focus should be on educating the consumer that ALL sketchy 3rd party sellers are bad, not just Travelgenio, and that one should book directly with the airline. >>Actually, I think it's far wider than that.It's not just about 3rd party airline ticket sellers.It's about being wary of doing business with ANY company that you don't know are legitimate and trustworthy.I've just read a post on another (non travel related) website about a company selling alleged Birkenstock footwear.In this case, the poster had enough sense to ask before placing an order.People - it's YOUR money. Make sure you don't throw it away to the wrong companies.Check the company out FIRST. Not AFTER."
"As I regularly say, in my view it's far, far better to try and protect yourself and your money than to rely on other organisations to do it for you. Especially when the latter involved having to raise complaints and try and get your money back after the event.I couldn't agre emore with Sonia B. If T&C's are unclear or you consider them misleading, then run away fast. Of course, people do have to read them before they can make such a decision, and far too many just don't bother.All this talk about trolls and attacking the consumer is, frankly, a bit pathetic."
"That’s very true!! I was thinking about only the context of this Air Travel Forum, but yes, in general all online businesses need to researched and intially mistrusted. It’s interesting that in “real life,” no reasonable person would expect the knowledge and expertise of a five star sommelier from a fast food employee (nothing against fast food employees!), but when you walk into a McDonald’s your expectation is that the order taker will punch in your order correctly and that is all. And yet people expect so much more from Travelgenio and their ilk, the fast food equivalent of the travel industry, and it’s just very interesting seeing what the internet can do to cloud reality for these folks."
"<<All this talk about trolls and attacking the consumer is, frankly, a bit pathetic.>>I guess it's easier to refer to people as trolls than look yourself in the mirror and say 'I made a mistake by not checking this company out before giving them my money'."
"I am constantly amazed by how people are smart enough to come on a message board like this after they have spent money and complain. However they are not smart enough to do any research before they handover money to anyone they find on the Internet. I admit that if you’re smart enough to find the site to complain it’s hard to feel sorry for you, you obviously have enough brains to do research. It’s too bad you did not put them to use before you pulled out your credit card number"
"Unfortunately, it is much easier to blast others and call them names than it is to accept that you have made a costly mistake. Even 30 years ago, few would admit to such things. Pub converstaions were always about getting the best deal on a car, or a kitchen, or how someone got something super cheap. It was a brave man or woman indeed who admitted that they had been ripped off through their own errors, it was always someone else's fault!"

I have recently booked a ticket through Travel2be from Mumbai to Toronto. The fare was lowest as compared to others and the ticket was issued instantly without any issue. I would recommend this website for flight ticket booking.

"I will NEVER EVER use this site again. Total disaster from getting confirmations in German (I speak English and booked in English) to having the customer service assistant tell me to stop talking as I was trying to explain that I wanted to change my return date. He insisted on interrupting me then got annoyed and disconnected me. Yesterday they had computer problems and could not change my date and today they did not have anyone who spoke English and I was told to call back another time.Changes cost a LOT on top of which there is a high admin fee.LOUSY, BAD. I will not use again.BUyer beware."

"That's funny. Gabrielle has tried ot ge thelp on three separate occasions and failed, but 'of course' you can help, simply through Gabrielle trying again. I don't suppose Gabrielle is laughing, though."

"Travel2be is incredibly misleading how they show the prices.I had selected my flights, inputted all the travellers details and put in my bank card payment details and clicked confirm. whilst loading when i thought payment was coming out for the original price of $3100 i looked back at the screen and a pop up box had popped up saying prices were now $6759 due to increase. Then it asked if i wanted to continue. You could very very easily select ok and pay 110% more...I had to check my bank to make sure it had not come out.it had not come out so i proceeded to retry, the very same thing happened again.Travel2be advertised incorrect flight prices to lure people in! DO NOT try to book with them! it is a SCAM! I also worry what they do with all the personal information they gather ie childrens names, date of births and also my bank details. This is very concerned. Where is there phone number to contact them to discuss this matter ?!"

"What do you want to discuss, helen? They are what they are and they do what they do. And they are not the only company who don't have live pricing.Just avoid all the online booking sites and book your flights through the airlines or a reputable bricks and mortar travel agency instead.I'm afraid there is no magic air fare fairy who will get you cheap flights.Edited: 1 year ago "

"@Travelgenio, the person you’re referring to hasn’t received anything so how would they contact you with a booking reference?@Vivy, if you’ve not received anything contact your CC provider to dispute payment. And next time book directly with the airline, using a third party especially this close to travel can only cause issues."
Sometimes from Nigeria being scammed. Karma?
"@Sunmagic, Thanks a lot. i have contacted my CC regarding that and i am waiting for them to initiate a charge back on that transaction. if i had seen their reviews here, i wouldn't have made that mistake. Thanks"
"I hope you;ve learned an important lesson, then, vivy. Always check companies out thoroughly before you hand over your money. Your payment gets taken a lot quicker than it takes to get it back again."
"Dear Vivi135, our team already sent you all the info through mail reference #1975127. Please refer to it and reply there if you need any further details or assistance. Regards"
"I also found the same problem with their pricing scam. They provide you with a price which is less a discount and then when you click pay after entering in your credit card information, they issue you an invoice with a different amount. Besides, if you are in the United States, you can't contact them by phone except you are using an international phone line. They are based in Spain and have no contact in the United States."

I have emailed you several times within the past couple of days and it appears you don't even want to admit that the price of the ticket you displayed on the purchase page and the price on my invoice after I entering my credit card information are different. Hundreds of customers can't possible be complaining of the same thing it it is not valid.I need my refund. I am already initiating my report to the US Trade Commission.This is not right.You don't even have a phone number that customers in the US can get to you. Its appalling.
Could you please tell us your booking code to check all your incidence and contact you back? Without identifying your booking we cannot assist you. Regards

All these people posting about issues with this company and 'Travelgenio' pops up to help every time.Wouldn't it be wonderful if the people come back and let us know if and how Travelgenio have sorted out their issues.Just sayin'.
Here here..PPC
I don't think that Travelgenio have sorted anything out in most of the cases.

"Exactly - though if it had been me I'd be here ranting about them not following through with anything.Fortunately, though, I've never gone near this mob or any other online booking flight booking site apart from those of the airlines themselves."
"Hi, i have same bad experience with them. I just try to buy some tickets and after the price changed with €100 for paying with visa, and then a mistake appear on my name and i try to call them on the numbers from their website , i was waiting more then 30 min on phone ( i was charged over 25 euro on my phone) and nobody answer. There is no email where I can't send a request ."

"Do not book anything with Travel2be - overall very bad experience.I have been receiving emails stating that my itinerary has been changed - to some hours that do not suit me. Of course I have tried to contact them, but that seems a bit likem ission impossible. After waiting more than 10 min on the phone the line sounds occupied and then the connection is lost. Also, there is no email address on their website, where I cans end an email. But, eventually I managed to get into contact with them via phone, and asked to find an alternative because the one they sent was not good. They found a much better one, and told me that they will send it via my email. So, while I was waitiing for the new booking, I received an email with the revised ticket - WITH THE WRONG HOURS AGAIN - the same hours for which I have called them to modify. Now, I am again in the situation where I need toc contact them, and I can again not reach them over the phone.This is such a waste of time! I have never experienced such poor services from any travel agency."
"Hi Diana, of course we can help you with your booking changes. Sometimes airlines change their flight plans and our agents inform passengers about the possible alternatives.

"Travelgenio. You might be interested to know that somebody has started a new thread today about their problems with your dreadful company, They said that they have tried getting in touch after you specifically asked them to and guess what...………..nobody has responded!!!!!Pretty much what we always thought then. You post to try and make the company look a bit better and then do nothing!Edited: 1 year ago "
"They are bloody cheaters, yeah. They show one price but... no way to pay it. When you choose any payment option it is always increased."
"Like many other booking sites, they don;t have live pricing, Samuel, so it;' sbest to look on their advertised fares with a great deal of caution."
"Hm... finally I got a ticket with public price and even via PayPal. The system has a trick: if your first step is choosing of payment system (card or PP whatever) the price will be automatically increased.But!!! If you start to put your card details without choosing payment system, and then choose card mode or even PayPal - the price is the same as public. My best wishes."
Never ever use travel2be. If you don't want to lose your money. I lost 1300 dollars because I could not cancel my airline schedule. Their cancel page does not work and they do not have English speaking staffs. Their customer service is horrible.
"Ok. So that's 2 new posters joined today, both say they're from Seoul South Korea, and both complaining about the same company. Yeah, right, whatever!"
johnma910We heard you the first time.No need to repeat it 3 more times.
"I have left some comments here before, but I see myself in the need of doing it again. They say they are going to contact you, and reply to you, but then you do not hear from them. I had to contact the flight agency - in my case KLM, directly in order for someone to take action. They have been very helpful and helped with my matter. So, if anyone needs to do anything, just do not count on Travel2be. So, far I still did not hear from them, even though I contacted them by email and phone and so on...."
"Our team replied your mail under mail reference 2031175 telling you the current info and alternatives we had for the involuntary changes made by airline. If you need any further details, please follow that mail chain. Regards"
"Hi,this is not true! You have only sent me one email. You did not send me any alternatives or options! You have only told me you are going to look into it. there is no information in it!"
You will receive an update during next hours. Regards
"Ok, noted. thanksBut please ntoe, that I have already received an updated flight ticket from KLM directly, which has an itinerary that suits me. I have also sent you an email about it, but I do not know if anyone has checked that. I would like to keep the hours as per the KLM ticket that I have received."
"After reading this thread, I wish I have a time machine sent me back to yesterday and punch on my face to stopping me using this terrible agency.I booked flight tickets to Japan yesterday, and also done the payment by my wife’s credit card. However, I received an Email told me that I need to pay extra 105 EUR to complete the booking.I can’t accept the extra 105 EUR, so I have to cancel the payment (my angry wife stand behind me). I sent two Emails and get no any response yet. Try to use the Travel2be’s CUSTOMER SERVICE through website today, and there is always a window pop-up after I click the submit button, tell me “Código incorrecto inténtalo de nuevo”, which means “wrong security code” (I am pretty sure that I enter the correct security code).So, who can borrow me a time machine? Please.-------------------After made a phone call to the customer service today, they cancel my booking immediately.Happy ending!Edited: 1 year ago "
That's true.. i faced the same issue today while booking flihts from FRA to india. Very poor customer support . And not sure if my flights are booked or not. No one pics up the call

"I had agreed to pay X amount for my ticket - on the payment page the price was listed in three places as X. However as soon as my payment was processed, the extra 45 appeared. I never agreed to pay this. I have emailed the company and am waiting for a response. I've also seen on Twitter that some people who used this site to book tickets for flights with aeroflot were left ticketless - when they contacted aeroflot, the code number provided by travel2be did not exist.Edited: 1 year ago "

"That was my very same experience. My total was $364.00 clear and big as soon as I hit pay after entering the card details. It spiked up $25 taking the total I was charged to $399.

"Do NOT use this company, unless you don't anticipate changing anything. Sure, they have cheap flights, but their customer service is not existent - if you call them, after the obligatory hold period, you get hung up on; if you email them, all you get is a copy of your email back. Seriously not worth it."
"Last year in January, I bought a ticket for my son. I also paid additional money for the maximum fee on Cancellation Protection Plus insurance for not being able to travel no matter what the reason. My son was not able to travel and I have since that time being asking Travel2be to refund me my money as I paid the cancellation protection, but up to now they are still sending me from Travel Agent to Airline office - from pillar to post without helping me. I find their customer service not helpful. They did not direct me to the right people that could solve my problem. I have sent many emails to no joy. I think this is the most reap-off Travel Agent and Lufthansa was the airline, did not help."
"If you had travel insurance your claim is against the insurance company, not T2b or Lufty. Your ticket would in all probability been non-refundable so therefore it is an insurance matter provided the reason your son did not travel was covered by the conditions of the travel insurance."
"did you follow the process at least 24 hours before the flight departure?""If once you have purchased the protection, you need to cancel your booking you must send us, at least 24 hours before the scheduled departure of the first flight of your booking, a written confirmation indicating that you have the protection and that you want to cancel the booking. This confirmation can be sent through this contact form or by fax at +34 91 754 5683."""

Thank you! The other thing they do is offer you payment in your own currency - which ended up in an overcharge payment of USD 70. So angry.
"Simone,Being offered to pay in your own currency is called Dynamic Currency Conversion and you will find that in many places around the world. This news report aptly calls it ""Robbery by choice"". ALWAYS pay in the currency of the country being visited.https://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-…https:/…Dynamic_currency_conversion"
"they are really cheaters. It is not possible to pay with maestro card. So automatically your amount of payment will increase. I called them, the person agreed it was a kind of cheating, but it was not illegal she said !!!!!"
Did you still book with them then after being told they wouldn't accept a certain type of payment?

This people are a sham!!!!!!!!!!!they stole 500 dollars from me. I purchased ticket for April 2019. They sent me an email saying my booking has been canceled that's all they said.

I booked a flight today, also redirect via Skyscanner and noticed that they charged me around 40 Euros extra than advertised.

"2,669 posts at this point, and most probably 95% of them say exactly the same thing."
And virtually nobody comes back to say that they have had a satisfactory outcome! I wonder why?
"Trav,I also wonder why the punters never report back. They are so wound up to vent in the first place, if they were then dudded again they would re-double their vent I would have thought, but as the vast majority are one-posters in the first place they would likely not report a successful resolution (although in all fairness a lot of the whinges are because they did not read the T&C's and would never achieve resolution in their favour).Strange."
"Maybe they just can't find the forums again. They probably forgot what words they used to find the thread in the first place, and the navigation on TA has baffled them :-)"
"Frommy, I don’t think some posters understand how the forum/threads work. I think many read the OP, hit reply and then that’s that. Notice how many of the one off posts are a direct answer to the OP, even though it was years ago. Or how they can’t figure out how the reply buttons work. I know stuff like that is configured differently on other forums, but it’s clear after reading a page or two of a thread how things work around here. It’s why we get so many, to whom are you responding? comments!"
"right! Forum navigation is a challenge for many newbies, and TA don't help matters with the reply buttons and in being so different to most other fora."
"This is the second time when I find myself in the situation where I have to write here. It seems that Travel2be is not capable of doing their job. In October my itinerary has been changed and it was extremely difficult to get in contact with them. Now, 2 weeks before departure, I noticed that my itinerary has been changed once again. The situation is the following: I am flying from Aalborg to Shenzen. However, I have to transfer the flights in Amsterdam and Shanghai. That would not be a problem. However, they made it really impossible. The flight from Amsterdam arrives to Shangai Pudong Airport at 6.55 a.m. and the transfer (as per the new changes they made) needs to be done from Shanghai Hongqiao Intl Airport at 8.15 a.m. This is not possible, because the trip from one airport to the other takes at least 1h02 min and the time between the transfer is of 1h20 min. This gives only 20 minutes to check-in the luggage, do the security check-in, go through passport control and all the airport procedure. In the same time, every airline policy states very clearly that the passengers need to be at the gate 40 minutes before departure. I do not understand who was in charge of making such a booking, but this is simply physically not possible. Moreover, considering my initial flight ticket, I did not buy or consider or included costs as transfer from one airport to the other.Nonetheless, I contacted both KLM and Travel2be, thus spending 3 hours on the phone with them, and not being able to solve anything. Why?! Well, KLM informed me very clearly that, because I have bought it through an agency, the agency needs to contact their trade center and to find a re-route. However, when I passed this information to Travel2be, three times, their answer is that they cannot change/touch the flight because of the flight status and only KLM can do so. But KLM can only do so if Travel2be contacts them. But, Travel2be keeps saying they are sorry and there is nothing they can do. It seems they are not aware of the passengers rights and regulations according to the European Union’s laws. Article 8(1) of the Regulation imposes on air carriers the obligation to offer passengers a triple choice at the passenger’s convenience. ‘’The air carrier has to bear the costs for re-routing or a return flight, and must reimburse the costs for the flight borne by the passenger where the air carrier does not comply with its obligation to offer re-routing or return under comparable transport conditions at the earliest opportunity.’’ And there are many laws and articles, showing that how they are handling this is totally unacceptable and they are breaking all passenger’s rights. However, all that I want, is some to do their job properly and book me a correct flight from the same airport, without me having to change airports. I have a very important meeting to attend to Shenzen on the 9th of February, and one way or the other, the company needs to make this possible, since this is what I bought."
"Hi Diana, changes are made by airlines and, as a third party, we inform you about the alternatives they provide us. If airline has taken the ticket control, we cannot modify nothing in it. Please send us all the details to customer.service@travel2be.com and we will check the info we have and the possibilities we can provide you. Regards"
"But you do not understand that it is your responsability to check with the airline, not mine as a client! I paid for your services, but you are not providing them!"
You will receive a reply by mail with all the details. Regards
"diana,That article you quote applies to the ""air carrier"". You booked through a third party ticket flogger, not an air carrier."
"I was just going to say the same thing. You didn’t purchase the ticket from KLM. You are not the customer of KLM. You can’t expect the laws and rules to apply to you. It’s like when people expect the 24-hour cancellation rule in the US to apply after they purchase through a third party. That free cancellation only applies when the flight is purchased directly from the airline. Only more reasons to purchase direct. There are many complaints through this forum about third party middlemen book layovers in a large that involve a transfer to another airport in the city. It’s completely idiotic and makes it look like the flights were cobbled together by a computer and not a person, but that’s what you signed up for. Cheap. Cheap service. Cheap aftercare. Cheap everything. Ethically they should do better, but what they’re legally obligated to do may be a different story."
"Well, I know it is not KLM's responsibility, but since I saw that the third party does not understand their job, I thought KLM could help, because they helped before. The problem is that what do I do now? I mean I paid for these services anyways, I planned everything, And to be honest it was not that cheap, cheap thing as you mention. And the initial flight I booked had very good schedule and this was another thing that made me choose it. It is not me that made an unreasonable and impossible trip. And yes, it feels like talking to robots, not human beings. And it is their responsibility to solve this.... but somehow they do not admit it. It is honestly crazy what is happening 2 weeks before. And seriously, the booking they made it is absurd: to transfer from one airport to the other and change flights in 1 hours and 20 min when only the trip from one airport to the other takes one hour. I mean, this is just impossible. But, I am waiting to receive the email they have mentioned they will send."
"Hi againThe email you have sent me is really not helpful. You mention that the airline took control over it. So please contact the airline!!!! I booked through you, so it is your job to contact the airline and solve this issue!"
Follow the mail chain if you need any further details about the current situation please. We cannot proceed as a third party without having the ticket control.
"Travelgenio. Just for future reference....""We cannot modify nothing"" is not grammatically correct.You should say ""We can not modify ANYTHING"".If you say you can't modify NOTHING, it actually means you CAN modify SOMETHING."
Diana - which airline was originally operating the Shanghai to Shenzhen flight? has the airline changed? (I assume there was not an airport change when you first booked?)
"Listen, because it seems that you are not able to understand. In order for you to get control over the ticket, YOU need to contact the TRADE CENTER at KLM. This is the solution!"
"Hi Carol,No, everything was fine when I made the booking. It was no airport change. And yes, they also changed the airline. Before it was China Eastern and now it is Shanghai Airlínes. But I really do not understand what is their problem and why aren't they contacting KLM..."
Have you noticed that you're talking euros and she's talking u.s. dollars?
"this happened to me where on the last page, the price all of a sudden goes up!"
"Hi Lynniehsu, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"Here we go again. ""Of course"" they are not going to help you! If they were, then they would answer their phones and emails from their customers!"
"I've had a terrible experience with this website. I think they might be operating fraudulently. I made a booking for a flight to Hanoi. I received 2 emails on the day of booking. One with a 9 page PDF all in Chinese (as I am in Taipei) and the other was booking confirmation. I had researched Hahn Airways but nothing seemed to be coming up. I thought it might be an affiliate partnering up with another airline and since the return flight was with Vietnam Airways, I thought nothing of it. On the day I am supposed to be travelling, I am at the airport check in counter and they tell me there is no reservation. My fault for not doing my research properly and ignoring the fact that I didn't receive an E-ticket, however because the payment was taken a few days after I made the booking, I assumed everything was fine. I called the company - and they are in Spain - a female Cust service rep tells me they emailed me to inform me that the original flight was not available and they found me another flight but it was a little more expensive. I received no such email, and she would not speak to that. She just kept telling me but you should have known that you didn't receive an E-ticket. I feel it's their responsibility to get in touch with me as they have taken my money! I have no idea if I will be receiving a refund, but I have asked for one. BEWARE of this company! Does not seem legit at all."
"Jae, it sounds like you knew something was wrong, but you didn’t trust your gut. Never wait till the last minute to sort something out. As soon as you didn’t receive a ticket number/couldn’t find your reservation on the airline’s website, that was the moment to act. Why didn’t you simply book directly with the airline yourself? Why go through a well-documented shoddy middleman in the first place?"
"Hi jae83_00, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"'On the day I am supposed to be travelling, I am at the airport check in counter and they tell me there is no reservation.' Does this mean you did not check the status of the booking until the day of departure?'I feel it's their responsibility to get in touch with me as they have taken my money!' Only to a small extent. After buying an air ticket the responsibility lies with the purchaser to ensure all is in order, especially checking with the airline rather than with the (in this case hideously awful) ticket seller.'I have no idea if I will be receiving a refund, but I have asked for one.' If payment has been made but there is no booking - and I'd check with the airline to ensure there is no booking - then contact your credit card provider. Ignore the forum posts by the Travelgenio bot."
"Jae. The message from Travelgenio is one that a bot has posted. Take no notice as they do not intend to help you at all. If you care to look back a few pages, you will see the bot posts the same thing over and over again."

Wish I had read these reviews first. What Travel2Be do is totally illegal as they even try to demand more money after your flight has been confirmed! Luckily I used a credit card so am protected and have disputed the original payment but DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE!!!!
"Wrong. Nothing illegal and your flight was never confirmed. You did not make a booking. You made a booking request. The first email confirmation you received was to confirm the booking request and not an actual booking. As you would have realized had you done research/read the terms and conditions, Travel2be do not have live prices. When they attempted to make your request and the price did not exist (again, covered by the terms!!!) they came back to you with the real, higher price."
"I wish I had read these reviews first!!! What Travel2Be are doing is completely illegal. They tried to charge me an extra 600euros AFTER my booking had been confirmed by both them and the airline, but they refused to issue the tickets unless I paid up. DONT USE THIS WEBSITE!! Luckily I booked with a credit card so I cancelled within 24 hours."
"Norton. I'm sorry but dire though they are, Travel2be are doing nothing illegal, only what you signed up to in their terms and conditions.  I would now spend some time reading a few of the posts on this thread that will explain everything to you."
Hi NortonM22 please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. RegardsEdited: 1 year ago 
"Travel2Be/Travelgenio are a dire outfit indeed, but they are not criminals."
"It puzzles me how many people come here to assure us that everything is ok because they have made a successful booking, but they have not yet got to the checkin counter or even received a ticket. I’d be much more reassured if they had actually taken their flight first."
Bad experience using their platform.Prices seem cheap but halfway through the purchase there is a price amendment.Their personalised service charge is definitely a scam - don't pay extra for tt option - who selects their seats from a text box?!?I would rather pay more for a service I trust than use them again.Won't be using their site again.

"Do not buy anything through them!!! I had the worst experience with Travel2be. Their customer support is not accurate (and I work for customer support). I had to cancel my trip last year ($3000) and they gave us the option to pay an additional $1200 to change our flights or cancel and get our refund. Of course we opted for the refund since we were planning go have our trip in February. They sent me an email with confirmation and that we would get the money in 1 to 3 months. It’s been 4 months and every time I call, I get that they are processing the refund or they are going to call/email etc with a confirmation. never again"
"I also do not recommend Travel2be. We found our tickets through Skyscanner ($3000). I had to cancel the trip because I had issues with my documentation and they gave us two options, we could change our flights for an additional $1200 or we could cancel and get a refund. Of course we had to choose to get a refund. I’ve received an email with a confirmation that the refund would take 1 to 3 months. It’s been 4 months and I’ve been calling probably every week for two months to get a status. Their customer support is very misleading, every time I call I get a different response or they said the refund is being processed and I would receive the money by the end of the week, by the end of month. We bought tickets through different websites in the past and they are by far the worst"

"Travel2be is the worst company where I bought a flight, they never answer emails, they do not have a telephone service, they also stole 1,100NZ. I bought a flight and paid for an insurance with which I was going to be able to cancel up to 36 hours before my flight, I did it one month in advance and it is a date that still does not refund my money. I advise you never buy a ticket with Travel2be they will take the worst experience of your life and many prayers."

Thank you so much for your warning. I was almost going to fall that trap. They really took good amount time of mine
Most horrible platform and bloody cheaters. They cancelled my flight despite complete payment being made. They showed me final price in $ and even sent me invoice in $ but later I see they charged me in euro and put conversion charge on me. When I raised question they cancelled my ticket without even telling me. I found out about it at checkin counter. They had not even bothered to return the money to my account by then. Was on my anniversary trip had to see my wife cry coz of these #@#& and paid 3 times the original ticket price.When connected to customer care they just ask you to email them details and then give an automated reply. Just cause they are in different country they take advantage of us. If any good lawyer in Spain is reading this and can help me it would be great. I have all evidences including call recording of they accpeting their thing.

I have booked return tickets for my family from Mumbai to London on this portal. My return was booked on Virgin Atlantic flight which was operated by Jet Airways. I called the customer service and the phone is never available and doesn't ring. I then called up the mother portal Travelgenio.com. The owner is someone called Mariano Pelizzari from Spain. Someone spoke to me after a long wait and disconnected the phone without resolving the matter. The customer representatives are not even taught to speak properly. I am still waiting for the refund after the Jet Airways shut down. I hope I get the refund at the earliest. Prasad
"you need to identify where your money is - Travel2be are unlikely to have your money as they will have used it to purchase your ticket from the airline. They will only refund you when they receive the refund from the airline.Was it a Virgin or a Jet ticket number? If Virgin, have you checked with them if and when they have issued a refund to Travel2be?"
"Hi Prasad, please send us all the details to customer.service@travel2be.com and we will inform you about everything. Regards"
LTravel2Be are bandits. Its simple like that. I made the misstake to book tickets at their website and the price went up and up for every transaktion. At the end I was stuck with tickets that allowed no bagage. I must travel naked.Never again. Travel2Be sh ould be stopped and deleted from Internet.Simeon
"Hi Sven, if you need any info regarding the luggage policy of the tickets you purchased, please let us know all the details in customer.service@travel2be.com and our agents will inform you. During the booking process all the info regarding the bagagge is shown in an icon. Regards"
"Yes, I’ve been caught by travel2be too.....travel2be books me a premium economy seat when I searched for and believed i was purchasing a business class seat. Discovering their error within hours I immediately began attempting to call their customer service number, which i was horrified to learn was a toll call from the US to Spain. I called 30 times over two weeks with my calls mostly ringing then being disconnected before being answered. Less frequently I was in the useless voicemail menu which gave me 3 inappropriate options that did not apply—mostly after waiting 5-45 minutes the call was disconnected while i waited on hold before reaching a representative. Finally, in the two or three instances when I did reach a representative the rep DID NOT SPEAK English, or spoke English so poorly communicating effectively was impossible. Many of these calls were disconnected while I was asked to “wait”. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON’T BOOK THROUGH TRAVEL2BE.COM."
"Hi Marc L, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"I'm sorry you had to learn the hard way what a poor outfit Travelgenio are, Marc. I wouldn't expect anything to happen following the message from the Travelgenio bot. This is the same message they have posted thousands of times.But please come back and let us know if by some miracle they do assist you."
I am trying to reach the India Customer Service Contact number of Travel2be but the phone goes silent after 1 bell. I have sent an email for them to reach me. Lets wait and watch.
"First of all, when I booked my tickets through travel2be, NYC-Moscow-NYC, I did not see a choice for meals, when it's usually a choice right away. Then trying to call, I spent at least an hour handing on the line, three times the call was just dropped. Then Spanish speaking lady picked up and she did not speak English. Then after a while, I finally got someone who could speak English and she told me that if I want to add or change meal choice through them, I have to pay 20 euro per person! What?? It's included in the ticket price. Always. I am so frustrated."
which airline did you ask them to book for you? the information on meals would be on the airline website. Were you trying to add a special meal eg Vegitarian etc there has maybe been some sort of terminology confusion.
"Hi Kseniya K, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
"Ksenya, do you mean you need to order a special meal? The airline may let you select for free but your didn’t book with the airline. Did Travel2be five you the airline booking reference? If so log on to the airline site and make the request. If they haven’t or won’t go e you the reference, then you will need to get them to do it for you and they will want to be paid for doing extra work on your behalf.if only you’d booked direct instead of using a dreadful OTA"
"When you are booking your flight, the system always asking you to choose a meal, regular or kids or vegetarian. Travel2be did not have that option and when I called to add it myself, they asked for money."
"Well your not the airline’s customer, they are. So you’ll need to pay them. These shonky ticket floggers that people think are so cheap have to make their money somehow and they do this by controlling and charging for all additional stuff."
"Yes, they make their money through additional fees. There's nothing to be done about it. You've been caught in a classic third party trap, I'm afraid.I have also wondered whether the airline you've chosen includes meals in their fares, or charges extra themselves. I don't know who flies between New York and Moscow, so I can't even begin to guess."
>> the system always asking you to choose a meal <<is this something specific to the airline on the airline website if you book direct with them?
"I just had this exact experience - the price quoted throughout the booking process was $100 cheaper than the Emirates website - it was only on the credit-card page that I noted - thanks to a last-minute Google search which prompted me double check - that the $100 had miraculously been added. I booked through the airline.... I have plenty of good experiences booking through third-party websites - most recently an amazing Black Friday deal from Singapore to Hawai'i through the scarily-named CheapOAir - which went like clock-work - booked seats, veggie meal & all. But this one - not so much.Edited: 1 year ago "
By the way - this was also a Skyscanner redirect.A couple of other sites advertised a cheaper price on Skyscanner and then raised it when I was rediretced - but at the very START of the booking process - not on the final payment screen.
"You were NOT redirected from Skyscanner, you chose who you would book with from the offerings,"
"Please try to understand that you are in control of where you choose to go. You decide which results to follow up, not Skyscanner. So you are not directed or redirected. You see the results and you make the decision.You have the control, you have the responsibility."
"Wish inhad a fiver for every time some hapless victim is directed, redirected or linked from Skyscanner completely against their free will and made to buy.If I also got a fiver for every time someone wrongly used the terms scam, scammer, scammed and thieves. I’d be flying in first all the time"
My experience is even worst than that. I have put it here: https:/…5ce302409a846c80755cb1b8Edited: 1 year ago 
"Hi waqas, of course we can help you with your booking changes. Sometimes airlines change their flight plans and our agents inform passengers about the possible alternatives. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com and we will inform you about the latest flight schedule and the alternatives they gave us in case they don't suit your plans. Regards"
"Waqas, why do charge you the fee, even though it was the airline who made the schedule change? Because that was the contract you agreed to. You were able to take the new flight offered to you free of charge, but if you are requesting a flight change then of course you will have to follow the terms and conditions which you agreed to."
"If you want to be able to sort things out with the airline directly, then you need to book with the airline directly. It's that simple."
"yes, be aware. Unfortunately we read this review after our bad experience with travel2B just now. Misleading site. Not clear at all. Customer service did not provide us an answer on our question. They proceeded our request wrongly. While booking the flight, we could not choose between hand luggage only or hand luggage and 1 checked luggage. When clicking on bagage the box behind it was empty - no information. We selected the request extra bagage for 14 euro each in order to be sure that we would be able to check in one luggage; On the confirmation mail I received Sunday after making the reservation for the flight tickets, there is written 39,80 euro on the invoice and total 294,50 euro so we thought everything was already included in the price charged by our credit card. We were surprised to receive the mail from travel2B asking us to pay 14 euro x 2 in order to proceed the request. We asked for clarity.I repeatedly asked for clarity on what the price was for being able to check in a luggage - not the price travel2B charges for the service. Two times I got this message:Mon 5/20/2019 5:50 PM : In case you wish to add checked baggage the price it's the one we provided you in the previous email. Tue 5/21/2019 11:51 AM :We inform you that the price previously reported is given by the airline.I asked to forward me the mail in which this price was reported. I even called travel2B to speak to someone on the phone . -> travel2B did not forward me the mail. They did not write me the price for checking in. On the phone they could not give me the price neither. They said someone would inform me on the price by mail the next day. On Tuesday 21st we finally thought we had understood it clearly and said to Mahela that she could charge 1x 14 euro to proceed for arranging that we can bring ONE piece of luggage for the two of us together, so 1 extra luggage in total and not 2 extra luggages. We were surprised to be asked to pay 37 euro on top of the 14 euro. No clarification that this was in fact for 2 luggages.We only read that on the final confirmation letter we received after paying the additional cost: we paid 39,80 euro = 19,90 euro X 2 pax. THIS IS FOR 2 luggages. Again, not what we had asked for."
Posting in one thread is sufficient abossier. Multiple posts are likely to get removed by the community..
"Hi Abossier, of course we can help you with the luggage information and the service pack conditions to add luggage. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with your booking code and we will tell you the allowed baggage for your ticket rate. Regards"
"I pulled the plug and ordered from Travel2Be tonight from Washington DC to Vietnam and made sure to pay through Paypal in case anything scammy happens. After reading hundred of pages of reviews between this site, MyTrip, and Gotogate, I decided that Travel2Be would be the most trustworthy of all. And better that they provide Paypal as an option. They did notify me once that the tickets have increased in prices before booking, and asked if I wanted to continue the payment, so nothing sketchy happened on my end... yet. Crossing fingers. Anyway, I got my e-tickets within 15 minutes. I'll update if I ever get to Vietnam successfully. The prices offered by Travel2Bewere already fairly expensive, so I couldn't justify spending another $500 by booking directly with ANA which is the airlines I prefer. Other airlines I checked charge roughly the same amount extra or even more. Hopefully I picked the right poison."
"“While booking the flight, we could not choose between hand luggage only or hand luggage and 1 checked luggage.”Abossier, ok. Stop and think. At this moment in time, why were the red warning lights not flashing and going off like crazy? Why would you ever proceed with your booking on a site that felt confusing and you were unsure of what you were buying? Yes, travel2be are inept and all that, but you kept going when you knew something was off."
"Hi Michelle, thanks for your comment. If you need to help you with your booking at any moment, please send us your query to customer.service@travel2be.com and we will be pleased to give you support. Have a nice trip. Regards"
"Michelle.Are you seriously saying that after reading hundreds of dreadful reviews waring about Travel2be, you still went ahead and booked?Sorry but I find that very hard to believe!!!"
"Traveller from the UK, I did :) And I can share my confirmation screenshot if needed. I had checked out other review sites for Travel2Be as well, and they were slightly more positive, unlike MyTrip (which was my first option frankly). I also emailed their support service about luggage fee which seemed to be a problem based on the reviews, and they responded within 12 hours assuring me I have 2 standard-23kg-baggage allowance plus a carryon. So far, no complaint, but still crossing fingers 'till I actually board!"
I'm speechless! This one thread alone has over 500 posts most of which are complaints and it is by no means the only one on this forum. Complaints run into the thousands.You may have noticed that the Travelgenio bot has now racked up over 3000 posts offering to help people? That surely must tell you something?Good luck is all I can say!
"Sure, but consider what I've experienced from far: they let me know the prices have increased before checking out, they let me pay through Paypal and sent me my e-tickets 20 mins after, I emailed them and they responded within 12 hours answering my question. Nothing suspicious happened to my order yet. Everything's going the way it's supposed to.And from this thread alone, while there's a lot of valid complaints, I've seen many unreasonable complaints from people with subpar English skills or lack of common sense, so I'm taking everything with a grain of salt. I'll update my process as I go through :)"
Travelgenio is the worst service - robbing consumers of money through ill-informed terms & conditions. Yolanda on the call-line couldn't be more unhelpful and obstructive. What terrible customer service. I'll never be using this platform to book travel ever again.
"I'm betting that you didn't choose Travelgenio because of their reputation for stellar customer service, Mikey. I'll guess you chose them because of price?michelle, I do wish you all the best. It is possible to use these sites once, or even a few times and get away with it. But your good fortune will eventually run out."
Hi Mikey C. of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. RegardsEdited: 1 year ago 
"I'd like to update my Travel2Be experience. I used their booking confirmation number and was able to choose my seats directly on the airline's site for FREE. The flights are confirmed and ready. I had to provide this input because at least two people in over these 50 pages in this thread were complaining about how Travel2Be charges them for asking for seat selection. Obviously, they are a third party reseller, they're going to try to make profit, since their prices offered are already lower than other competitors. You can just practice a little common sense, and use your confirmation number (which Travel2Be provided within 15 mins of ordering) and negotiate directly with the airlines. I also got to pick my meal preference.Edited: 1 year ago "
"It just happened to me 2h ago when I booked my flight ticket with Travel2be via Skyscanner. The original price on Skyscanner was $405, but after the payment with Travel2be I paid $429.98 instead. This is insane to mislead and overcharge people.Please, be very careful when you do the reservation with this company. I don’t really recommend it."
"Hi Sokda, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"SAME thing happened to me! But it is not just the price,the luggage allowance is not even included after I purchase the ticket!!! When it is clearly stated during the purchase that 2piece luggage is included."
"When you go through a cheap third party ticket flogger they are almost always going to book you in the lowest fare bracket and this means no checked luggage. Perhaps it was not clear on the website or in the terms and conditions of the ticket, but somewhere where it’s always clear is when purchasing directly from the airline website."
Then where do I send the screenshot of the luggage allowance included during the purchase? Their customer service doesn’t even allow you to do so with their one way answer and question type of survey form. Reading all the replies here back from 2016 made me realize how long this had been going.-Transparency and honesty are the key for the success of the company. No need to mislead customers to generate sales. Words of the mouth travel faster as how the power of social media nowadays does-just wait until this to trend.-
"Have a read of the thread, a couple of replies before yours Travelgenio have provided an email address. Send your screen shot there although I doubt anything will be done for you."
"If you have the screenshots then why don’t you try to send them to your bank/credit card and get a chargeback for what you’re paying for luggage. Word of mouth has already spread about how awful this company is. This thread alone (one of many on TA) goes back to 2016. With all the warnings and and info on how they operate, why did you still book from them? I agree that word of mouth can be very powerful, but only if you research and use it to your advantage."

"Even worse - I was quoted 380 for a flight, got to a confirmation page online that said I was charged 400 for a flight - just to check my email to find a charge for 420 had been made on my card! Even though I never agreed to it, provided the screenshots of the discrepancy and complained, their costumer service is not doing anything about the problem - saying that the prices provided are only quotes. I will never again use Travel2be or TravelGenio - they just stole money."

"Keep away from these people - You have been warned!They are the most unreliable group or Company I have ever had the disgrace to try and deal with6 hours on the telephone, no answerThey took 24 hours to answer an email for God's sakes!!Ones you click with them, you are connected with a chain you cannot break, especially the Payment option. You get nothing after you pay, you don't know if you paid or not and there is NOBODY to communicate withI had to call my Credit Card Company to block them, they were trying to get my money by giving me NOTHINGThank God I got to my Credit Card Company before they did"
“Keep away from these people - You have been warned!”This thread alone is nearing 600 posts and goes back 3 years. There are countless others like it with complaints going up in the thousands. You clearly were warned too. Why did you not heed the warnings yourself?
"Hi Bearnie, we will be more than pleased to check what needed regarding your booking through our customer service mail: customer.service@travelgenio.com that replies in less than 24 hours. We feel sorry if there was a delay on your first communication. Regards"
"Bernie,You have no idea. You made a REQUEST for T2b to try to buy a ticket for you. They do NOT have tickets to sell. They also do NOT list prices that are live. They then take time to try to find a flight for you for the price you saw, which mostly they cannot so either make some excuse why not, or ask you for more money."
"I'm in the rather unusual position of being quite impressed that this outfit answered an email in 24 hours. I mean, I've waited longer than that for an answer to a simple enquiry from much better companies.I do feel a bit weird about this, as it almost seems like I'm defending a company that I despise. I'm not though. I suppose I'm pointing out that they have far more serious flaws than taking 24 hours to answer an email message."
"Its absolute bogus site.I booked tickets for my parents and i wanted to change the dates and initially after long multiple holds they only did change for 1 passenger under the same booking code. This makes no sense to me when i told them to do the changes for both the passengers under the same booking. Though my ticket was refundable they have penalty fees + travel fees and all hidden fees.Every time i call them customer care tells me a different penalty fees and hidden fees. Half of the people do not understand english and those who do , do not do their job correctly. It being a nightmare to just change a date in a flight. I have never seen such a pathetic airline booking site. One of the customer care charge me the penalty fees for both the passengers but changed the booking for one, when i asked them why they did that. They hung the phone on me. I dont understand who gave them the license to operate such fraudulent site. Their payment link does not ever and they have no other way to take payments. Its a ruthless bogus site. Please dont but any airline ticket from them"
"This is not a defense of Travel2Be, but they are not a travel agency and should not be expected to act as such. They are a ticket flogger. They are (sometimes!) capable of transferring your data to the airlineâs website, but they should not, I repeat should not be relied upon to do anything else. They have no customer service, they canât change ticket dates or process special requests, etc. If you need flexible tickets because you anticipate needing to make changes to travel dates then there is no reason not to purchase directly from the airline- the company who will ultimately need to move around your flights. Itâs just not in a shoddy third party middlemanâs business model to provide good customer service (or forget good- any customer service.) If you want to gamble and use a shonky third party like this, you need to be prepared to fly basic economy and not make any changes at all to your booking (and hope the airline doesnât make any changes either)."
"Hi Suchandra T, you will receive a reply to your mail during next few hours. regards"
"I just booked with travel2be and they totally messed me about. I got the email confirming the flights then another saying that the booking was cancelled. They said they refunded me the money but it has not appeared in my account! I need the money to book new flights so this is very annoying. And yes, the price dies change at the end of the booking so be aware of this. Not worth it in my view!!"

"Hi dale263, I'm sorry for the situation you're in. Here's my thoughts:It's not uncommon for a flight to be cheaper via a partner (codeshare) airline. For example, a trip from New York to Vienna (with a layover in London) where the first segment is American Airlines and the second is British Airways may cost one price from the American Airlines site and another from the British Airways site.Which airline(s) have you spoken too? With codeshare flights its also not uncommon that you may not be able to select seats properly on the operating airline when booked from the airline that marketed the flight. Travel2be's non-refundable seat selection fee & policy is quite unfortunate however. As you might have noticed, customer service isn't their strong point, as with many of the online travel sites. If you were overcharged to begin with and have it all well documented, you may want to consider having your credit card/bank cancel all the charges and rebook with the airline directly."

"""However this is a direct non stop flight""What I was saying is applicable to direct or layovers. For example if I'm flying NYC to London, sometimes the AA price for the same flight (some are operated by BA, some by AA) is lower than the BA price for that same flight, or vice versa. I obviously pick whichever is less. Good luck sorting it out with Travel2be."
Yes a travel agent got dirt this out for you but unfortunately you didn’t use one of them. Instead you picked a shonky online ticket flogger who provides non existent service because frankly that’s the only way they can sell cheap tickets.See their bot has already responded. Don’t hold your breath about it actually delivering. It just gets used here to give the impression they care but they don’t
"I bought ticket with travel2be yesterday with cancellation protection plus policy which says refund in any case as long as you inform them 24 hours before the flight,. I have submitted the request for cancellation 3 times. In terms of making reservation with correct name and price no issue. everything has been fine so far. I am hoping they will honor the refund per policy as traveler has lost her passport. [Ticket #2546868. Ticket #2546837, Ticket #2546831I have submitted the request for cancellation 30 hours before the flight. Tried to send a fax the number had error and fax could not go. I will update if I hear back from Travel2be and in case they refund."

"On April, 28, I booked a flight home to Toronto (QYFC47) from Frankfurt for June 28. I have used Travelgenio in the past and booked this flight the exact same way I booked all of my flights. I paid, I received a confirmation email that looked like all other emails I received in the past after booking. I didn't think of it again until the day came to fly. I got to the airport and was told I was not booked on the flight. I had no ticket. Nothing. I had a family event so waiting to take another flight was no option. I paid 1,790 EUR on that day. $2,500. This was an EXTREMELY devastating experience and has completely changed the budgeting for my trip, and the months that will follow. To say I am disappointed is an understatement. Furious. Also an understatement. I work internationally and frequently use(d) Travelgenio for my bookings. This was the last time. I also work with hundreds of people who travel and, upon my return to Frankfurt, I will be telling them of this awful experience with your company. Rest assured, you WILL lose customers for this.I expect some sort of reimbursement or compensation for your company's mistake. I am happy to seek legal advice from my uncle if needed. I do hope your company takes this seriously, as I would hate for someone else to feel the shock and frustration I felt on the morning of my flight ...where all I wanted to do was go home."
"Worst site I have ever seen.very much misleading. I have booked international ticket from this site .I selected AIRINDIA FLIGHT .I Igot a booking I'd with a etickt mail which is sent by travel2be but when I tried to search the ticket status in airindia site its showing no booking available.could you please provide the ticket which is sent by airindia.

"Today received a reply with subject: Request processed 92P7VCDear customer,We are contacting you to inform you that the requested refund has been processed.You will receive the refund on your card in the following days.Please do not hesitate to contact us again if you require further information.Travel2be.com Other contactsMy question is the following: the cancellation plus policy says REFUND IN 15 DAYS. After 19 days and 4 emails later asking where was the refund (with replies saying that they are in process of refunding) I get this specific email saying that I will get the refund in coming days. So why mention REFUND in 15 Days... why doesnt the policy say Refund eventually, or refund within 1 month, or 3 months... I paid 50$ for this policy to protect against need for cancellation. Why I cant pay after the purchase or date of flight .... If I must follow the rules and buy this policy at time of purchase of ticket then why cant I be refunded as stated in the policy. I suppose as stated above, I should be grateful if I ever get the refund... I guess I will be grateful if I ever do get the refund."
Sadly you should be glad if you ever receive the refund (minus fees I assume?). Are you sure the 15 days are not defined as 15 business days and not actual days?
Hi DAC81. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours. Thank you for your collaboration.
"I confirm receiving the refund in full yesterday. They have honored their refund policy and I will be happy to buy this policy and tickets through them in future should I require. And this post should also serve to give confidence to other buyers that this is not a scam. If I may say I think having this forum does help in facilitating timely processing. The policy doesnt say 15 business days, just says day, but if we look at it in terms of business days then refund was received within 15 business days. Good luck everyone. This email was received day after last post: Jul 9Dear customer,We are contacting you to inform you that the requested refund has been processed.You will receive the refund on your card in the following days.Please do not hesitate to contact us again if you require further information.Travel2be.com Then this email: Jul 10We are pleased to inform you that the refund of your booking 92P7VC was completed on 09-07-2019.The refund was carried out as follows:Refund to your card: 316,26 EURShould you have any questions, please reply this e-mail.Kind regards,-- AlbertoAdvanced Support Agent"

"I have to agree. As far as I can see, there isn't much in this saga that would persuade me to use them again. It seems to have taken a few weeks and not insignificant effort to get 85% of your outlay back."
Very misleading website. My final purchase price was $1628.65 but charged $1764.90!! I would not recommend this at all. In the end the 1st price changed twice before end of form. Do not recommend travel2be

"Do not use this company they are thieves in board daylight. Sent multiple emails to follow up on my complaint I sent on 9th July 2019 asking for a refund and I still have not received a reply. Called their customer service today and they were no help. We paid for baggage and as stated on their website for baggage select the “Personalised Service” during the booking process"" option. We didn't find out until we got to the airport that we did not have check in baggage for our flight. We ended up paying for our baggage at a higher rate cause when you purchase baggage at the airport you pay almost double the price if you would purchase it online and before hand and the airline had no record nor did they know what the “Personalised Service is.This service is a joke and be sure to confirm that baggage has been included before you get to airport."
"The joke here is that people will still book their flights and THEN find out about the extras. AND come on to complain. Not every 1st post means the poster has never been on TA before, but a bit of research is much better before booking!"

"I bought an air ticket from their website with a flexible ticket insurance. According to their website at that time I could do ""either cancellation or date change"". I have a screenshot of the same as proof, as available on the website. But their customer service representative says I can't cancel my ticket without paying the airline penalty and admin fee. This is very misleading from their side.It's a very negative experience for me. I was mis-led by what was falsely advertised on their website. Even if it was their website error, my decision of buying that option was solely based on that. These people are deliberately mis-leading customer to make money. Own your mistakes and error travel2be!!"

"Fraud site , I booked a ticket with 143$ unfortunately I changed my trip plan they asked my additional 175$ to cancel that 143 $ ticket illogically.Stay away from travel2be"
"“Fraud site , I booked a ticket with 143$ unfortunately I changed my trip plan they asked my additional 175$ to cancel that 143 $ ticket illogically.”Actually, it’s not a fraud site, at least with the information you provided. You paid $143 for a non-refundable, non-changeable ticket (I presume, as this is what they normally sell). Then you agreed to a set of terms and conditions. You said you read and understood them. You agreed to all fees they would charge in case of cancellation. Nothing illogical about them charging a fee you agreed to. The only thing I can surmise being illogical here is you agreeing to a set of terms and conditions that you didn’t actually read. It is quite illogical to enter into a contract without reading it first."
"It ain't fraud and it is logical, sorry Jithin. You see, the company, rubbish though they are, are perfectly within their rights to enforce the terms of the contract that you agreed to.That is not fraud. It is normal, logical business practice, I'm afraid."

"Booking ID # F0LZCYI have been cheated by KD 59.15. The amount was deducted from my card without confirmed tickets.I had booked my tickets from Mumbai to Kuwait. Travel2be deducted the amount from my card, but the tickets were not confirmed. On checking with the Customer care she offered me the PNR of EMIRATES flight (Q6CZS2) as mentioned below …Clearly it shows details of flight. I asked them to send the tickets to me, post which I got to know from Emirates no such PNR exists on my name.  I was then sent an email that the ticket is not confirmed and was given an option to fly with a flight which was not going to help me reach my destination on time. I immediately responded and asked them to cancel and give the money back to my account. Which has not been attended or responded. I need my money back immediately.Can someone please share the contact details of the authority to whom we can address such issues, as its hard earned money…..and not to be given for no service rendered.Regards!!"

"""Can someone please share the contact details of the authority to whom we can address such issues,""Stand in front of a mirror as that is where you authority lies, and repeat 100 times ""Book direct with the airlines""."
"Just like everyone else here I ´ve made very bad experience with this company, and I can only warn everyone!I booked a flight VIE-AYT and was forced to pay ""klarna"" (because that ´s the only way to avoid high cc fees).After the payment I got information that my ticket wasn´t confirmed (no further information provided). I asked for the reason and they said that the tariff wasn´t confirmed by the airline (i.e. they sold tickets without permission by the airline).So I asked them to refund the amount to my bank accoount. They promised to so within 24-48 hours.I asked them again. No answer.I asked them again. No answer.It ´s 2 weeks now, no money refund."
"No they didn’t sell tickets without the permission of the airline (that’s a load of bunkum). They don’t have ant tickets to sell nor do they have live prices. What it means is that when they tried to buy you a ticket, they couldn’t because the price no longer existed or never existed. So they blame the airline...Pity you didn’t pay by credit card then you could have disputed the transaction. Even bigger pity you either did nonresearch or ignored others warning and picked this well known awful middle man rather than buy your ticket from the airline.It’s possible that they will eventually refund you but they will take their time doing it. You wanted cheap - cheap doesn’t pay fir loads of highly trained staff just waiting to deal with your case."
"Hi Gerry, of course we can help you with your booking reimbursement. Please note that repayment depends on the airlines and each of them have different administrative times. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with your booking code and we will see your reimbursement status and the approximately management it will take. Regards"
"Gerry, Travelgenio are never going to be transparent or tell the truth about how they work. Nor will any of the other shonkies. That's why they come up with a load of bunkum to try and obscure the truth. It's all smoke and mirrors.What their message meant, of course, was that they hadn't managed to find a flight at the fare you saw on their website."
"Just look at the reviews for travel2be, all awful"

"My wife booked a ticket through Travel2Be and she payed for extra luggage, as she is traveling with a suitcase. She got an email, telling that she indeed payed for the extra luggage. When she got her ticket, the luggage was not mentioned on the ticket. So she phoned with Travel2Be (which was a real temptation) and Travel2Be said again my wife was right. After a couple of days my wife got an email, telling that LATAM-Airlines is charging another €18 for the luggage. So it seems that my wife has to pay two times the same extra luggage. Very annoying. Also meanwhile on internet she can book the same flight for half the prise. I totally do not recommend Travel2Be !!!!"
"Hi Felix, of course we can help you with the luggage information. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with your booking code and we will tell you the allowed baggage for your ticket rate. Regards"
"Expedia is one of the worst customer-friendly travel agencies. Typically, you reach an Indian call center where the representative speaks poor english and usually put on hold, costing a lot of phone big charges. Usually, the issue is not resolved in one phone call. Very frustrating."
vpnrt.This thread is NOT about Expedia!
"Am not surprised. Had the same experience with them last year. I wanted to change route in my booking and they refused saying it’s not possible then I called the airline direct and was told it’s possible and to call back Travel2be be because I booked through them. I called them back and still they were behaving to be funny, one of them actually cut the line and I called back this time with no mercy and I shouted at them and the minute I mentioned I called Emirates and they told me it’s possible their attitude changed, charged me €75 per ticket to change route."
I don’t recommend too.
Thanks for your comments Kaby. They help us to improve our services. Regards
"Never again !I booked the flight from Warsaw to Bali via Travel2be, and paid extra 20€ service for pre-booking the seat as I am tall and need a extra leg room. Apparently it is not possible (i just got the information from the airlines about that). I called the customer service, and afer some problems with tracking my reservation, they just confirmed that it is not possible and it is not their responsibility. Therefore I ask what did I py for, the answer was - for reissuing the request !!! Is it a joke ? They charge 20€ for service which is not possible. I asked to get the refund for it and obviousle it is not possible either ! I will never again use this protal and company and suugest you guys to aviod them."
"You need to read the terms and conditions of what you’re paying for a lot more carefully. As they said, you are paying for them to request the seats. Obviously, extra legroom seats between Warsaw and Bali would be A LOT more expensive than 20 Euros. That should have been a major red flag for your right there that something wasn’t right. If you wanted to ensure you had certain seats, you should have booked directly through the airline. If you had, your options couldn’t have been clearer."

No office pick up the phone. I even sent the message on facebook. Is this company closed? How come nobody assists in three countries??I bought the open ticket as I have to change the flight date. Could you please respond the my email???????? my original booking is 15th Oct and have to change to 14th Sep. I'm so worried nobody assists and in the end my ticket is useless."

utter bull *****ooked an airline ticket just now i have not received my e-ticket and my payment is completed . Now i checked again . now i see my booking status is cancelled .. this is cheating real cheating ...
"No you didn’t make a booking or book a ticket. Whatbyou did (with zero research) was ask a shonky ticket flogger to make a booking for you (you only made a booking request).They put a hold on your funds, then try to book a ticket for that price. They don’t have live prices, so when they can’t buy you a ticket for that amount, they cancel your request. The hold on your funds will drop off in a few days.Whilst you’re waiting for that to happen, do some research on all the shonky agents out there and hopefully that will convince you to book directly with the airline next time. They have live prices and availability and you can book your flight right away and receive your confirmation within minutes."
"muniya, you will probably be surprised at just how common this is. Because Amo is quite right about what has happened, and it's exactly the same with many of the ticket flogging sites.They will say just about anything rather than admit to not having live pricing, but the clues will all be there in their T&C's."

"I purchased a Ticket from Tel Aviv to Paris for the 13 of october as per I will have a surgery in Paris, through travel2be.On Thursday 19 September I receive an email from them telling me my ticket was canceled.I replied I didn't cancel it, no news then since the next day when I called the customer service, they told me they will get back to me.No news since this morning whrn I tried to join them again as per I didn't get any update.They hung up twice.So I bought a new ticket through another company and this is the reply I got when I asked them a refund of the ticket:[Ticket #2826617] Reservation UZEF76Dear Mr. Erick,Thank you for contacting us.In reply to your request, we are sorry to inform you that based on the airline’s fare rules your ticket is nonrefundable.Do not hesitate to contact us again if you require further information.Kind regards,-- Customer Care TeamThey charged $193.78 for the ticket and they refuse to refund it, when they canceled it.Be careful with this company."
"It sounds there is a sea of the problems with the Travelgenio. However, the good thing is that they seem to be listening and responding at least in this forum. While users have not replied whether they got a satisfactory resolution or not, at least I can not see a resurfacing of the complaints. This makes me hopeful that my [Ticket #2832666] Cancelled Transaction] shall also be attended as per my last mail and I shall get a satisfactory resolution. Happy traveling."
"Sorry Global Citizen but no one at Travel Genio is paying the slightest attention to the complaints here, it’s just a bot responding."
Hi Global Citizen. You will receive a reply by email within the next few hours (#2832666). Thank you for your collaboration.
That bot responding just adds salt to the wound.
"the bot thing is pretty amusing. Does anyone know how long they take to process a refund, my flight was cancelled by the airline, so I asked them to cancel my whole booking as it was gonna leave me stranded at BKK airport for too long. They said they are processing it but just wanted ballpark of around how long that might take?"
We have been trying to contact but nobody responds
"Hi Nafys, you will receive a reply by mail during next few hours. Regardss"
Could you please answer my query as well @travelgenio? is it true that the refund process can take between 15-90 working days??
"HI Jawwad, if you need us to check the refund status, please send us all the booking details to customer.service@travel2be.com. Refunds depend on airline authorisation and management. Regards"
looks like they've updated the bot's reply template
"Travel2be scammed me $114. From Skyscanner it showed me 716 Euro, and when I booked it showed me the same price. I chose the debit card option, and it showed me the same price, but after I paid it said it charged me $897.36 which is $114 more. 716 Euro should be converted to $782 or a bit more as conversion fee. I called them and they say to cancel it's 150 euro fee! that's ridiculous. Since I'm a lawyer I will take care of it for good."
"Oh, please Mr Lawyer, do keep us informed of your progress."
"Hi Itamar B, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"Be extremely careful when buying from this website. They took my money after purchasing tickets from their website. The day after I purchased my tickets, they sent me an email saying that the price was 130 EUR more. Of course, the prices are lower in other websites, but Travel2be misleads you by giving a lower price than what it actually is. By the way, the haven´t refund me my money back and it has been over 24 hours since they sent me that email."
"Ah, another one who doesn't understand how these things work. You have not made a booking at all. You have requested that Travel2be make a booking on your behalf, and they have confirmed back to you what you asked them to do. Their website does not have live prices, and neither do those of their competitors - the only truly live pricing is on the airline website. A very few on line bookers (Expedia is one) do a live price check while you go through the booking request procedure so you see what you will pay before you click accept. Most do what Travel2be have done, contact you afterwards, when your booking request reaches the head of the to-do list, and tell you you need to pay more, because they can't buy for the website price..So going elsewhere, unless elsewhere is the airline, won't help much.Regarding the payment, if you check with your card issuer you may find that they have placed a hold on the money, rather than actually taken a payment. If so it will drop off autiomatically after five days or so. If not, you'll have to wait for them to refund you.Is this illegal - no. Prices are advertised as ""from"" not as exact amounts, and the whole thing is explained (fairly clearly actually) in the terms and conditions you must have clicked to say you had read and agreed.Best thing is to book with the airline. What you see is what you pay, all the options about baggage, different types of seating, seat reservations etc are spelt out as you book, and you get a confirmed ticket when you pay."
"Hi Jose, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"Jose, the other, lower, prices that you saw on other sites won't be live, just like the Travel2Be price wasn't. So if you tried to book with any of them, exactly the same thing would have happened - you'd have been asked to pay more. If you don not proceed, your money will be returned (or the hold on your funds will drop off) but it will take a few days.Edited: 4:19 am, October 03, 2019 "
"I booked a flight through Travel2be for travel from Chengdu to Adelaide for a relative. The first leg of the flight was three hours late which meant they would miss the connecting flight to Adelaide. While the passenger was in transit I contacted Travel2be to try to sort something out but they were not very helpful. I got the run around between them and the airlines the flights were booked with. In the end I was told the call them back as soon as the first flight had landed. I did that but was unable to get through for nearly two hours. When I did they again told me to call back when the flight had landed. I had to explain to the operator several times that the flight had already landed, when it finally sunk in they said they would call the airline and get back to me but they never did."
"Hi HeysenWalker, of course we can help you with your booking. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your doubts and we will answer you asap. Regards"
HeysenWalker - if this was all on one ticket there was no need to involve your 'agent'. The airline has control of the ticket from T-24. This should have been a case of the airline amending the onward flight.
The airline did not provide any assistance and we had to buy another flight back to Adelaide. I am still trying to resolve the issue.
"Which airlines were involved, and what were your flight numbers? Is it possible you had separate tickets if the airlines couldn’t/wouldn’t help you?"
"Sichuan Airlines from Chengdu, China to Melbourne connecting to a Virgin flight to Adelaide. Both flights were booked on the same ticket. At Melbourne airport neither Sichuan or Virgin would assist."
Thank you!
"Just booked and paid($1,936.16) for a flight for my fiancée from Edmonton , Canada to Melbourne, Australia. to which my fiancée received a confirmation.., with in less than 24 hours , Travel2be send out a cancellation of the booking with out any explanation, I called Travel2be local contact in Australia several times which is automated, they( Local contact) have taken me through their telephone menu with all of sort of languages and later cut me off , I'm suggesting Travel2be is a fraudulent and dishonest business and I will ADVISE any one wanting to book with Travell2be to reconsider.Edited: 11:02 pm, October 12, 2019 "
"Ernest,You did NOT book and pay for a flight. You sent a booking request to T1b for them to buy the ticket, for which they then either placed a hold on your card or charged the card, then when they went to the airline to buy the ticket,but because T2b do not have live prices, they found the price you asked them to pay for the flight, which they advertised, did not exist. They then cancelled your request.Smarten up and just book direct with the airline, who do have live prices, as just about all other online ticket floggers operate in the same manner as T2b.Edited: 11:52 pm, October 12, 2019 "
"Ernest - if you only use 'price' to choose who you give your money to, I suspect you will be disappointed many times. Just a couple of minutes research and you would have found that it was very possible the advertised price (the one that sucked you in) did not exist, you would have found reviews of their customer service etc, read the terms and conditions that highlight all the fees....Knowing what you know now, would you research next time?"
"Hi Ernest, of course we can help you with your booking doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with your booking code and we will tell you the booking status. Regards"
"Its warning! NEVER book tickets via such vendors. They are highly unprofessional and unethical.I used to book tickets via Travel2be, until last time, when I need to cancel my travel due to some unavoidable circumstances. I called travel2be customer care for cancellation, they said in 15 days I will receive partial refund. It has been more than 2 months now, and I have still not received the refund. When I call the customer service it goes unattended and if I raise a request for status from there website, I get same email again to me with some reference code, but no one reply to that email.They are stilling MONEY from everyone. I will never book any tickets from Travel2be and I would advise you all to stay away from them."
"If the tickets were non refundable, as I expect they were, then all you will be due back are the taxes. And Travel2Be's own fees might cancel those out."
>> need to cancel my travel due to some unavoidable circumstances <<are the circumstances covered by your travel insurance?...best to claim thereIt is very possible that the €50 service fee may be more than the refundable amount (some taxes)

"As soon as all the amounts were summed (including an amount for selecting a meal), I got the final amount. But when I clicked to pay, the amount escalated by $123.40. NOTHING before that explained why there would be an additional amount owing once I clicked to pay. In fact, the line on the invoice for credit card usage said ""$0."""
"Hi Teresa, of course we can help you with the payment doubts. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with all your booking details and the amounts that do not fit and we will check immediately all the details. Regards"
"Travelgenio (Travel2Be alias?) replied to my 10/14/19 posting, saying that it wanted to help with ""payment doubts"" about a tack-on of $123.40 at check-out. Subsequently, I got an e-mail from Travel2Be that my earlier confirmed flight was no longer confirmed and that I had to pay an additional 406 euros to get it confirmed. Luckily, I was able to block the payment made the prior day."
"Hi, I booked 1 ticket Mumbai to mouritus on 4 Oct and some plan changed than this ticket cancelled on 5 Oct but i did not get refund also customer care service so many mail but they dont reply so i have bad experiences with this site"
"Travel2go is like click-bait where you are lured with cheap prices and you go through the process of inputting your passenger info and then towards the end, you are presented with a price increase because you are using Visa or Mastercard or any major credit card. Only if you use Maestro where the price stays the same. Nope. Not today, Satan."

"WARNING!!! NEVER book through Travel2be. I requested a refund weeks before my flight and I received an email back indicating that the 'refund has been processed and I would receive it in a couple of days'. Anyway, I had another generic email buried in spam, advising that I was only refunded the amount that I paid to change the booking. I emailed several times with no response and spoke to customer service a few times with absolutely no help whatsoever. They pushed me to speak to the airline, but the airline advised they couldn't touch my booking as it was through Travel2Be, so I should be following up with Travel2Be.I then kept going back to Travel2Be to ask them to follow up again and they advised that they had marked my flight as 'No Show', even though the flight wasn't taking off for a day. They said the only way I could change my flight was to pay $600 through the airline directly (which proved impossible also as they only wanted to deal with the agent). All you get is generic responses and passed from one person to another on customer calls.They also don't have a physical address, and as an offshore company, it makes it an extremely hard task to report or find them. I am going to start the process of reporting them to ECC, in Europe.STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY. IT IS A COMPLETE SHAM!Edited: 8:17 pm, October 31, 2019 "
>> I requested a refund weeks before my flight <<what were the fare rules of the ticket you asked them to purchase? - most will be non-refundable tickets (refundable tickets can be very expensive)If you are unsure what you agreed to you can name the route and airline and it should be possible to find the refundable fare price so you can compare>> advising that I was only refunded the amount that I paid to change the booking <<on a non-refundable ticket it is usually some taxes that are refunded. (less your agents fees) Could it be that this is coincidently the same amount?

I seen that so many people was scammed by them .I hope the head for this mafia to stay in prison"

I've just booked a trip from London to Perth and have only now seen all these reviews.... I'm really worried I've made a mistake! Has anyone had a decent experience with this site?!
>> I've just booked a trip <<how recently? - has a ticket been issued or have you just submitted the request. If the latter then you should know in the next 48 hours or so whether they can fulfil the request or not.If you get a confirmed ticket and neither you nor the airline make any changes you may be able to travel without issue.If they cannot provide a ticket at the advertised price they will likely come and ask you for more money...at which point you can decline (don't say 'cancel') then you can book direct with the airline or at least research any company that tempt you with their advertised prices

"I deeply regret not reading any reviews before booking with travel2be.After I paid extra for the service of choosing a seat, they demanded I pay extra again claiming the extra I already paid was for their service but the extra for the seats was a charge from the airline.That airline was Emirates and after I had a quick word with them they were happy to change the seats for free for my Mum ( the traveller ) because she has had a knee operation and needs assistance. Travel2Be didn't even try to help, and their staff were extremely rude and didn't care at all that the request was due to medical concerns not just someone looking for a more comfortable ride. I told them I hope they have a VERY NICE DAY."

I've never had to pay for seat selection using a shonky/ota....Budgetair recently sent me a mail with the facility to online check-in and seat selection....or go direct to the airline and do it.......it would seem travel2be and Travelgenio are the same company....very low user rating reviews on Skyscanner
"Aye, Tim, they're basically the same totally rubbish outfit.Simon, you're far from alone in regretting not checking a company out. I hope you can learn from this and will remember to due your due diligence checks in the future."
They will mislead you and you will end up paying a lot in shock when you arrive in the airport! Please avoid travel2be online ticketing and booking. You do not want stress therefore avoid travel 2 be and thank me later.

Travel2be are the worst travel agent in this world. They are so stupid and there customer service team doen not have any sense how to talk with customer. They think they can make people fool and they does not a single word of customer service what is it. They are fuc-***g stupid and can’t help their customer if some one need their help. They should get banned and people don’t make any booking throug TRAVEL2BE.
TRAVEL2BE are the fraud!!!! They don’t know how to do customer service. They are so dumb and will not help you out

"I have the same terrible experience with Travel2be as I was redirected by Skyscanner when I am booking a flight to Oman Muscat.My return flight was cancelled by the flight operator Emirates. All I received is an email telling me to check with the Emirates, without any details of new flight itinerary. After contacting the Emirates, they told me that the new return ticket has been given, but Travel2be needs to reissue the e-ticket. I have made 5 phone calls over the last 24 hours and I have not received the new e-ticket. I have no choice but to agree with a 4am flight for the next day. After 2 emails, I was told that this flight is no longer available and I have to take another flight 10 hours later with 9hours transit. This has screwed up my holiday mood and jeopardised my work schedule as well. Absolutely not recommending to anyone in future. Till now, I am still standby waiting on the e-ticket. I am very close to walk away from this and just get a new one."
"Hi Yap, sometimes airlines change their flight plans and our agents inform passengers about the possible alternatives. Please send us a mail to customer.service@travel2be.com and we will inform you about the latest flight schedule and the alternatives they gave us in case they don't suit your plans. Regards"
"my flight was cancelled by the Emirates and Travel2be left it for me to contact with the Emirates. However, Emirates advised that Travel2be needs to ""associate"" the new ticket with my original booking. I have been trapped in between. Also, the Travel2be kept on changing the flight schedule for 3 times. It is a nightmare as I have to arrange my accommodation and work leave. Finally when I board the flight, at the Emirates ticketing counter, I complained about the situation. The Emirates actually told me that the rescheduled flight that I originally wanted is available and was assigned to me. Travel2be left a message there saying that I chose another timing. It may not be a fraught company, but the poorly run Call Centre is definitely sinking the company. As I have complained in the corresponding email with them, the survey email sent to me doesn't have a link. Someone has removed the link from the survey button to stop me from feedback truthfully about their service. Shame on you Travel2be."
"Yap, Travel2Be is a horrible company, as you now realise. I don't know what you mean by redirected, but my understanding of the word means that you were taken somewhere by Skyscanner.In fact, you chose to follow a link that Skyscanner displayed. It was your decision. You weren't taken, directed, redirected or in any way persuaded by Skyscanner.The truth is that Travel2Be et al don't care how you feel about them. They know that they will continue to get customers no matter how bad the feedback is here, or anywhere else."
"Thank you for contacting us Yap. As you know, airlines sometimes change their flight schedules, in which case what we at Travel2be can do is to help you find an alternative, from among the airline’s options. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travel2be.com with your reference so we can study your case and help you with the info provided. Thank you."
This Trave2be agent looks like a bogus organisation. Flight company cancelled my flights a few weeks ago and Travel2be are trying by all means not to refund me. Every time you phone you the agent you get answered by a person who gives you a different answer to the previous one. On top of that the people are plain rude. I could mention them by name if it becomes necessary.
has the airline confirmed when they issued the refund to Travel2be? (no third party will refund until they have received the refund from the airline and this can often add time to the process)
"Hello Tandanami, thank you for contacting us. Of course we can help you with your refund. Bear in mind that the refund times depend on the airlines. As soon as the airline processes it, you will receive your refund via the form of payment you used to make your booking. Anyway, please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travel2be.com stating your booking reference and we will check the status of your refund and will give you an approximate time for its processing. Regards. """
"Tandanani, I don't think they are a bogus company. Perhaps you just meant to say that they are utter rubbish? If so, I would completely agree with you.Carol is right that no agent will refund their customer until they've had the money from the airline."
"Yes,Can I trust buying a ticket from Travel2be to visit family in South Africa. I live in Sydney.Garth R"
Garth - why not book directly with the airline?do you really want to involve a middleman where 1) you will not know what the price will be until they deal with your booking request (maybe 48 hours after you submit your request) - are you being attracted by a non-live advert?2) have to deal through should the airline make any changes to schedulesYour money but reading the reviews...not somewhere I would spend mine
"Hello Garth. Could you please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com with the details of your flights and your doubts so we can assist you if needed? Thank you, regards."
"700 posts warning you away here, Garth.Folks do get successful trips on this company, but you need to be 100% aware of the risks and the responsibilities if you want to take a chance.Read this thread THOROUGHLY so you fully understand what you are in for."
Yes I think you are right. We've since been told they cancelled the entire booking and we will only receive the refund after 30 to 90 business days. Totally scammed and no communication to let us know that they had cancelled the booking. We now have had to book new flights with another airline (I will only book direct through airline sights now). The absolute worst customer service I have ever received.
"Hello Journey247194, thank you for contacting us. Of course we can help you with your refund. Bear in mind that the refund times depend on the airlines.

"My bad because before using their services for booking a flight through their website, I haven’t read all the reviews online, especially here and on Trustpilot, worst experience I’ve ever had with an online travel agency, I’ve booked a flight, when I could have booked on the airline website at the same price and hassle free, few days later I had to cancel my flight because my mom passed away, I contacted their representative and the airline company, and I’m entitled to a full refund based on this circumstances, by terms and conditions of the airline company and also standing by the Italian civil aviation authority.They cancelled my flight with the Ticket #2917393, i then submitted the required documentation months ago, the airline is willing to give a refund but is the travel agency that should carry on the request, they don’t reply to my emails, they haven’t given me any feedback, they stole my money and they’re being lucrative even on this terrible circumstances.Avoid at any cost, good if you want to use it as a search engine, but then book the same flight on the official website of the airline, you won’t have all the problems that based on the countless negative reviews you’ll read online people had with this agency."

IMPORTANT: You have given out your booking reference and your real name and the company you have booked with. With this anybody can now modify your booking. ADVICE 1: Remove your post.ADVICE 2: Just contact your credit card company and dispute the second charge.
"COMPANY STOLE MONEY FROM MY CARD.I have paid for tickets through my credit card, but then I noticed that there were 2 transactions from my card for these tickets, so I have bought it twice!!!!, but get only one ticket confirmation on my email (actually I need only 1 ticket). Through the second transaction they just steal this money from my card, they ignore me on email, I asked them to have a call where I can provide them with all profs about TWO transactions instead of one, but looks like they recognized their mistake and just ignore me to not return my money back."
"Thank you, I will try."
Hello Yaroslav. Of course we can help you with your queries on the amounts for your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travel2be.com stating your booking reference and your queries about this and we will check the details immediately. Regards.

No doubt the original price you saw wasn't live and up to date. It's common enough with third party ticket floggers.

i have made the booking online and they charged my credit card but after 3 hours they sent me email that your booking has been cancelled without any valid reason now i am chasing them to refund my money.i have raised a ticket using their website and received a confirmation email that airline has cancelled and they are processing the full refund which they have charged me. at least some positive email back from their but i do my level best and ensure that these both companies travel2be and travelgineo should be unlisted from the APTA ATOL panel.
Hello Fparekh. Of course we can help you find out if airline has confirmed your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travel2be.com stating your booking reference and we will check your booking status and will make sure you get this information as soon as possible. Regards.
"Give them a day or two to reply, Fp, and then dispute with your credit card company. You have their e-mail as proof that you didn't get what you paid for.And then stay FAR away from this company. You've been a member of TA long enough to know that you should research a company before giving them your money"
"This is upsetting as I need to book 2 flight tickets It’s a shame ! They are loosing a lot of business I was about to book, but I thought of checking reviews and it’s disappointing from all!"
I doubt you will find any regular here who thinks it is a shame. In fact most would sooner see nobody booking with any of the third party ticket floggers so they all go broke.
"I think it would be great if they and all the other rubbish third party ticket selling sites would disappear. Unfortunately, it's not going to happen. The best I'm hoping for is that a few of them will go bust as a result of the coronavirus issue making people realise just how poor they are."
"The worst company ever to book a ticket. Did not give me the refund back, though i ordered the tickt with refund insurance. I have spoken with two spanish ladies who could barely speak English and they told me that my money will be back in a few days, but nothing happened.Very dissatisfied and disappointed....Never, please never get in touch with them and use their services...It is a fraud and a scam!!!"
"Roman S... were these the terms of the policy? Did you claim exactly as specified?Cancellation protection PlusGet your ticket price* refunded if you are unable to travel, for any reason. The most complete cancellation coverage of the market!Did you know that you won’t probably get your ticket price refunded if due to an unexpected incident, you are no longer able to travel once you have made the booking? Most fares are “restricted economy class”, this means that changes and cancellations are not permitted and that no matter the cause, the ticket won’t be refunded, not even due to force majeure.Besides, even when refunds are allowed by the airline’s rules, the refund period will depend on internal processes of the airlines and this process can sometimes take time.The cancellation Protection Plus allows you to get the 85% of your ticket price in a within 15 days, if you need to cancel your trip, for any reason.If you want to take this protection, you only need to add the Cancellation Protection Plus when you make the booking. Bear in mind that the protection can only be purchased online at the moment you make a booking and it can’t be added to the booking afterwards.If once you have purchased the protection, you need to cancel your booking you must send us, at least 24 hours before the scheduled departure of the first flight of your booking, a written confirmation indicating that you have the protection and that you want to cancel the booking. This confirmation can be sent through this contact form or by fax at +34 91 754 5683.Once we have received your cancellation request and the necessary documents, we will process your case and within 15 days you will receive the 85% (*) of your ticket price refunded (service fees, administrative fees, cost of service and complementary services are not included).Bear in mind that the protection covers the cancellation of the entire booking and that partial cancellations are not permitted. Once purchased, this cancellation protection is nonrefundable under any circumstance."
"which cancellation protection did you purchaseIf the basic, then have you sent all the required medical information?If you purchased the Plus, have you followed the directions?""f once you have purchased the protection, you need to cancel your booking you must send us, at least 24 hours before the scheduled departure of the first flight of your booking, a written confirmation indicating that you have the protection and that you want to cancel the booking.

#770'The worst company ever to book a ticket.'You will soon meet the Travelgenio Bot....it will tell you that if you send them all your details they will make sunshine instead of rain......then of course having showed the public they pretended they cared....you will still be in the same mess as before....
"Thank you Roman S for your feedback. To review your case in detail, please could you write to us at customer.service@travel2be.com with all the details, so we can check what happened?. We look forward to hearing from you. Regards."
"Roman, as poor as this company is, they are neither a fraud or a scam. It's not criminal at all to have terms and conditions which you then abide by, and expect the other party to do the same. Having staff that don't speak brilliant English is hardly a criminal matter either."
Beware!!!! Travel2b is a SCAM!!! Once you purchase your ticket (which you end up paying much more than what they publish) they dont have customer service. You can be weeks waiting in their customer service phone with no answer.They have a recording that always says that the waiting time is 4 minutes and 25 seconds no matter when you call and you wait until you get disconnected. Don't even think to buy a ticket through these bandits
Don't say that you have a customer service if you can spend weeks or ever trying to contact them. THAT FOR ME IS A SCAM!!!!!!!!!!
"Hi Robusta, please send us all the details to customer.service@travel2be.com and we will be pleased to assist you. Regards"
"Robusta, your idea of a scam seems to be different to mine (and every dictionary I've ever checked) but I'm not going to defend Travel2Be or Travelgenio,They are appalling, and if you had checked them out first, you'd have known this and never have used them."
Yes they r very fisshy

"Absolutely terrible customer service. Even if you have to pay more to book with another company, just do it. I had to cancel my flight and spoke online with a rep, and he said it would be 75 euro.This was a hefty but I said fair enough and said I would call back to confirm with my sister. I call back and suddenly they say it is 250 euro. I told the rep that the first rep told me 75 euro and that 250 is ridiculous. She then tells me that they have no record of that and 250 is standard. I then get a different email quoting me 180 euro.....I asked the second rep to email me their terms and conditions and she lies to me and says she is not allowed to do that. DO NOT BOOK!!"
"Hello Nab. Of course we can help you to cancel your booking. Please send us an e-mail to customer.service@travel2be.com stating your booking reference and whether you wish to cancel the whole booking or just a part of it and we will indicate the conditions of your fare for cancellations which, as you know, depend on the specific conditions the airline applies.

"Travel 2 be is one of shadiest companies out there. Avoid buying a ticket. I made this mistake and ended up buying my ticket from them. Then I received a phone call saying i had to pay $48 more (for 2 passengers). When I said no they said they would cancel within 24 hours...when i said cancel they put me on hold, and then a minute later they said that they will ""eat"" the loss of $48, All shady business. Yes i got my tickets for the price i saw on the internet but it is not worth to deal with these people by all means"

"I have a bad experience with travel2be as well so I keep trying contact them but no answer at all even by email or leaving message on its page or asking Spanish friend call them 3-4 times but it is only automatic machine. We booked flight from BKK to MUC via Dubai on May 03, 2020 and back on June 03, 2020 vis Dubai as well but the problem is our flight from Dubai to BKK must be on June 04, 2020 at 08.50 AM but we ahve got an email that our flight change to June 05, 2020 at the same time but we just wondering how come Travel2be changed ou flight to the next day even its flight only postpone to 09.40 on the same day. We keep contact Travel2be for a few days but no response at all and why you are able to reply on Tripadvisor so please contact me back soon at bhashinee@hotmail.com. My booking is CZPMVV. My name is Nichapat Bhumibhamon and we are a family of 3 people from Thailand and all 3 passengers as following.Ticket number :1763771248697 - Bhumibhamon NichapatTicket number :1763771248698 - Bhumibhamon BhirayaTicket number :1763771248699 - Bhumibhamon Suthep I have received an email from Emirates airline that my returning flight from Munich to Dubai is still the same date and time but my returning flight Dubai to Bangkok is changed from June 4 at 8.50 am with flight no EK370 to June 5 at 8.50 am with flight no EK370 instead.  Due to we own 2 hotels in Krabi, Thailand which are Andamanee Boutique Resort Krabi and Thepparat Lodge Krabi and one of the passenger who is my sister (Ms. Bhiraya Bhumibhamon), she is the one who is running Andamanee Boutique Resort Krabi and she has a really important appointment to sign the hotel contract with a wholesaler in Thailand on June 6 at 10 am and we have already booked the flight ticket from Bangkok to Krabi on June 5 at 13.20 with Bangkok airways due to our original flight will be landing in Bangkok on June 4 at 19.15. Therefore we really can not take a new flight from Dubai to Bangkok on June 5 at 8.50 am and this flight will be arriving at 18.20 for sure due to my sister 's appointment with a wholesaler in on June 5 at 10 am . So it would be very nice if you will help us to change to another early flight which is on June 4 not on June 5,  I have already contacted Emirates Airline and informed them about this issue and one of the customer service team has already informed me that they can change my returning flight from Dubai from June 5 to be on June 4 instead and this flight will be leaving from Dubai at 9.40 am and it will be arriving in Bangkok on June 4. at 18.20Then I can make it to take the flight from Bangkok to Krabi on June 5 at 13.20 and I can see my wholesaler agent on June 6 at 10 am and sigh the hotel contract with them.  They also asked to me to contact Travel2be in order to change my returning flight from Dubai from June 5 to be on June 4 instead. They said after Travel2be contact them then they will change the flight for me right away. So I would be really happy if you will contact Emirates airline and ask them to change the flight for me and please change for 3 passengers. All of us would like to take the same returning flight from Dubai to Bangkok on June 4 at 9.40 am  Please contact me as soon as possible."
"Hi Bhashinee, you will receive a reply by mail during next days. Regards"
"Bhashinee, I strongly recommend you delete your post. Yoire not communicating directly with Travel2be but posting far too much personal information on an unmonitored public travel forum.

"The most horrific customer service experience from the most unprofessional company I've ever come across. China Southern changed my return flight for April back in January which I need to change or get a refund for, as the change is a whole day later which doesn't work with my employer. I have since sent at least 5 enquiries on Travel2Be's website, and called them almost daily up to 4 times a day since then trying to get through, only to be hung up on every single time. I've already sent reports to both the UK and AUS consumer affairs.Absolutely fed up and disappointed with this company"
Travel2be are the worst online travel agent . They wanted to charge me 450 euros to cancelkl my flight when the airline qantas is not charging a cancellation fee. When challenged on this no response. I have a flight 24 March but cannot cancel to get a refund.
"While Qantas may provide a full refund, you did NOT book with Qantas, did you. You have chosen T2b as your agent and, as such, you are bound by their t&c's."

"I've had my flight cancelled due to covid 19. You would expect after sending over a dozen emails that I would get some sort of reply. Every single phone call that I try to arrange would get cut off after being on hold for over five minutes. I have never ever taken time off to write a negative review on the internet but the closer the date gets to my flight, the more I realise that shady websites still exist on the internet. I expected that a redirect off skyscanner would most likely be legit but I would honestly approach this one with care. Even before the airlines canceled my flight, I informed them about several travel restrictions/bans that governments have applied and their customer service representative informed me that as long the airlines haven't informed them, they would not be able to assist me. Once the news reached them from the airlines, my phone calls seem to have either been blocked or completely ignored. I really can not believe how atrocious this experience has been for me and I really hope this does not happen to any of you."
"While I appreciate the numbers trying to change/cancel bookings at the moment, perhaps you should get more staff - it is very stressful for people to be getting no response when they have spent a large amount of money with you. I am booked to travel from NZ to New York this week and have spent hours on the phone to Travel2Be each time being disconnected after a period of time AND the website won't accept an email from me. Really disappointed in (and stressed by) your service"
>> perhaps you should get more staff <<EHR70 - had you done any research you would have found that you cannot expect expensive customer support from any of the cheap online ticket floggers (even before this situation)What is the benefit to them of paying money to put GDS-untrained personnel on the payroll so they can answer the phones but cannot use Sabre or Amadeus to access any reservations or help customers?>> the website won't accept an email from me <<use the email address supplied by the bot many times in this thread....you 'should' hear something in a few days Tim they say
Happy to pay the 50 Euros administration fee but the additional 165 Euros per person how do they justify this ? Never using them again - ever
Rubbish have written to you multiple times - you don't respond.

"I had really bad experience with travel2be lately. My international ticket was on April 3rd. I have contacted the airline company and was told that my ticket has been canceled by airline company since early March. I have tried contacting all the appropriate contacting approaches through the phone call or email, hoping to get the response from travel2be on time. Today was my original departure day. Since I couldn't get any answer from them, I am not sure what happened to my ticket. With covid-19 spreading out, I totally understand they might want to hold money for a month or two to deal with their sharp decline from the shrinking market and can refund to customers later. However, without any phone communication or email messages, how can customer knows what is going on. From our end, what we feel is that they would like to hold on the money and not return any more. By that logic, their services are extremely BAD. I hope people won't use them any more."
"They have been bad for three years that this thread has been running, and if they don’t go out of business they will be bad three years from now.Hopefully they will reply to your post here."
"Wow, these people will rip you off! Do not use them. Booked two flights through them using Aeroflot and Bangkok Airways and both have refunded through travel2be/travelgenio. I have contacted the airlines and they have confirmed this. Travel2be charged me twenty euros for a admin fee and promised me the refund yet I have nothing. They keep promising to contact me every time I leave a review on trust pilot but guess what, nothing! It's daylight robbery, I fully intend to get my money even if one day, when we can fly again, I will go to Spain and get it personally."

"8261. 'They' didn't cancel your flight, the airline did.2. The airline should indeed provide a refund to their customer, which is Travel2be3. To calculate what you are likely to receive back from them, re-read the T&Cs you read and agreed to - you did read them, right? - when you bought the ticket and deduct the applicable fees.4. You would have received notification of cancellation had you booked directly with the airline - in addition to a full refund."
My flight was two and a half weeks ago. I didn't get a notification about it being cancelled. i even checked my junk emails. My problem is travel2be hasn't replied to my emails and i couldn't find a phone number to call. the amount of refund is not the issue now.
"Hi Sam, You can find all the procedures and info in the following link. Regards…travelgenio.com/pages-information-regarding…"
"Hi, due to the current situation my Swissair flight from Zurich to Tokyo has been cancelled. The departure date was on the 4th of April. 2 weeks before on the 20th of March, I received an automatic email informing me that the flight was cancelled. So far, I've tried to reach several time Travel2be (resevation BL1ZJ2), and created ticked related to my reservation. However so far I didn't get any reply from them, and I don't know if I will ever receive a refund."
"Sebastien, As you can see from other posts on this and other threads, your case is typical. I think your expectation that you don't know if you will ever get a refund is, unfortunately, probably realistic."
Refunds will be processed as soon airlines approve them and manage them. Once received we will transfer them. Due to the actual situation all this process will take a few more weeks than usually. Regards
"Hello Travel2be, I did submit online forms more than 5 times before my departure day. Until today, I still didn't get any messages from your company. I am so frustrated with the service and zero responses from your firm. Airline said they have approved the refund on March 13th. Then my departure day is April 3rd. Now it's April 7th, almost a month. I still didn't get anything back from your firm. You keep saying that airline needs to approve it. Why nothing is returned back from your firm?Edited: 3:18 pm, April 07, 2020 "
"Few more weeks, I understand that. But please do not take me for a fool. It's been over two months since Aeroflot cancelled and I paid you the twenty euros for the admin fee. I can send you the proof of that if you like, so that's seven to eight weeks ago. S5EACE. as for the Bangkok Airways flight, they told me they refunded had refunded it but because of the current situation, I will wait a while longer. If you answered my emails, maybe we could be a bit further down the road."
"Y'all bought from a crappy company. I hope they get you your money back, but this is what happens sometimes when you go for the low cost provider."
Totally agree. I won't make the same mistake again. Could understand if they had not received the refunds but I know they have. Despite the whole COVID-19 issue they have no right to withold anybody's money. People need to be aware of these rip off merchants. I will go to the end of this earth to get my money back. There must be a regulatory body that I can go through. Just hope plenty of people see these posts and stay away from them.
"Kevin, How did you pay, you could dispute it with you CC/DC provider.So long as the money has been refunded to Travel2be then you have a direct link to the trader and they should return the money less fees. If the money had not been refunded by the airline then you can’t pursue Travel2be.However in these extraordinary I don’t know what a reasonable time would be to refund the money. The CC/DC providet will investigate. Just be aware that CC disputes are covered by legislation Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. DC chargeback is more of a courtesy scheme not covered by legislation.Contact your card provider and they will advise you.https:/…https:/…"
Thanks for the reply. I am willing to wait longer for one refund I must admit but one of the flights has been cancelled for over two months and I even have the email saying it's being processed from travel2be and a receipt for the twenty euro admin fee. I will go through the CC provider I just wanted to give them a chance.
"Hi yl9124, please tell us your booking code. Refunds will be processed as soon airlines approve them and manage them. Once received we will transfer them. Due to the actual situation all this process will take a few more weeks than usually. Regards"
"Hi Kevin J, Refunds will be processed as soon airlines approve them and manage them. Once received we will transfer them. Due to the actual situation all this process will take a few more weeks than usually. Regards"
Aeroflot is over two months ago. Stop lying to me. I've paid you but you have not paid me back as promised on the phone. I've got an email from you saying its done but no money.
As a third party we need airline to send your refund in order to be able to process it. Regards
"Then you need to speak to the airline. Later today I will send you all the emails I have from the airline and yourselves and after you have those, there is no reason for you to hold my money anymore, because as you'll see, it says your refund is being processed, that was TWO MONTHS AGO!! And a copy of the receipt for the twenty euros I paid for the privilege. As for the other flight, they also told that they have already refunded it. Therefore, you need to pay that too. So I think you can see why I feel that you are withholding money hoping I'll go away. The second of these two flights may take a bit longer that is granted as it's a busy and unfortunate time, but the Aeroflot one should be sorted by now. S5EACE. contact the airline, get me my money."
"As told, it will be processed as soon as airline makess it effective. Regards"
Being that this is the only way I can get through to you. Please give me an email so I can send all relevant documents that I now have ready. Once you have them it should end any argument and you will refund me. Many thanks.
Kevin: if you search the posts by TG you will find lots of info they have shared here.
"SCAM-Travel2Be & TravelGenio, the sister companies don't respond t refund/cancellation request, even if the airline has already announced free of cost refund/change. There is no other way to contact but through the contact menu which does not create any response from them. They keep on responding on forums, meaning they are still not dead, but they have robbed many customers of thousand of dollars and still have the impunity to come up with automated responses on these comments. I wish they get what they deserve. Incase they want to contact me, my email is cheema1973@gmail, and my ticket numbers are 235-33866886920 & 235-3386870523, Turkish Airlines is offering free refund, if these looters are kind enough to punch a few keys and cancel these tickets and refund my 1,500 USD."
"Hi Cheema, Refunds will be processed as soon airlines approve them and manage them. Once received we will transfer them. Due to the actual situation all this process will take a few more weeks than usually. Regards"
"Hello,I do not want to mislead other people. I finally got in the phone line and talked with someone from Travel2be. My refund is issued on April 6th, 3 days later from the original departure date. So not too bad. It's just hard to communicate with them over the phone or email."
Seems you are one of the lucky ones then.
"As requested. Codes are: S5EACE & S74IQD Bangkok Airways contacted me and said that they have refunded you but you have not notified me of any refund! As for the Aeroflot booking that was two months ago! Again I ask for a contact email so I can send all relevant paperwork including receipt copies of the 20 euros you charged for admin and the confirmation email I have stating that my refund was being processed, two months ago!"
"Their contact email is in many of the TG rep’s emails. Search their posts for lots of contact info, Kevin"
"Yes I do. All it asks is for an email to entered into a box and then nothing in return. Their phone lines are never answered and that was before the coronavirus issues and then when you do get through which was only once, the cost for that call was astrinomical."
"You picked a terrible company to deal with, Kevin. At least TG is posting here and providing resources. Use them, keep track of your attempts, file a dispute with your credit card company if you can.At worst you learned an expensive lesson about the penny wise but pound foolish game of booking cheap airline tickets and the importance of researching first."

I'm starting to feel a bit sorry for the bot. All they can do is post here.
"Shahzad: You posted today and you expect an immediate response when there are hundreds of thousands of folks in your position?Give me a break. Chillax. You picked a really bad company to work with -- note the EIGHT HUNDRED posts in this thread, and thousands more in other threads. The TG rep has replied to you, other companies aren't even doing that. Travel2Be is in Spain, aka Lockdown. It's going to take days, weeks, maybe months to get everyone straightened out.You're going to have to wait and maybe pray or wish a little. You never should have booked with this company. In good times they are pretty lousy which is why this thread is 3 years old.Did you do any research before you gave them your money? I mean, you have been a member here for over a decade, you should have known better in the first place."
"Guys, do not even trust this online travel agency If you value your money. This is a real scammer. They will not respond to email and in your hundred calls. That’s a clear crap customer service. They cancelled my flight and told me that they are processing the refunds so I changed my plan and cancelled my flight immediately to my company. I tried to follow up on my refund, but as usual, no response at all!! And then just a few days before my supposed flight, they re-open my same schedule which is really unacceptable. And so I tried to immediately request to cancel my flight to them and request for a refund but no answer on my calls (mind you guys, when I say calls, that’s literally nearly hundreds) and even my emails. What is this, on and off??? That is hard-earned money and they don’t care. The volume of clients (complaining) is never an excuse."

Mark:800 posts here over many years. WE KNOW not to use this company. Your post isn't going to help anyone.TELL YOUR FRIENDS! post on Facebook.. Tweet about it. You need to warn folks like you who don't do research before they throw their money at a bad company for a low price.
"Yes, they are scammers! Just never buy on Travel2be discount option - they will scam you at the end of payment after you spent one hour entering the flight details, passport details: names, date of births, passport #'s, they scam you at the very end with the price increase! Nasty scammers - Travel2Be must fo to hell with Coronavirus thing!"

"Worst Travel agent ever. I have been waiting for my refund for more 3 months and every time I call the customer service (which I paid additional for Priority Customer Service - Silver) they say wait for another one month. Their customer service people are rude and don't help their customer at all.Travel2be.com cancellation charges is much higher than any other company and you don't even get 40% return even your ticket was refundable. I will never ever recommend anyone to use this agent ever again.Regards,Helpless customer."
"Hi Sanjau We would like to study your case in order to see if airline has already approved and managed the refund.

You will immediately receive instructions"
"This travel agency is a scam. We purchased our Maldives flight back in September for our February trip. The trip got cancelled by the airline, and when my husband reached out to Travel2be for our refund, they said that it's already been refunded as of March 27th. It is now May 8th. We've checked all of our accounts, especially the credit card that we used to purchase the tickets. Don't use them, no matter what flight deals you find through them!"

Thomas: Read post 870.After you do that you will get an immediate reply with lots of information. After that you will hear nothing.Dispute your charge with your credit card company. For some reason you chose a terrible company to give your money away to. Good luck!
"Thomas G, if by some miracle you do actually get somewhere with this shower of owl pellets, please let us know."
"I booked a round trip from Germany to Turkey using Travelbe website. Travelgenio charged me on Feb 6th. My flights got cancelled by the airlines due to COVID19. In order to request refund, I called TravelGenio at their customer service phone many times. I was never able to reach them. I have opened customer service ticket through their website, and also followed up via email. TravelGenio has never responded. I sincerely put all my effort to reach them but got no response. Afterwards, I had no choice but dispute the transaction with my credit card. My credit card reviewed the case and issued a credit to me because even my credit card dispute department could not reach TravelGenio. After 4 months, TravelGenio re-billed my credit card AGAIN without getting my authorization. After this, I went to Travelbe website and submitted a refund request. Ever since, the status is never changing. It always displays ""Awaiting Airline Approval"". I am still trying to reach them and I am not able to talk to or get any response from them. It has been 4.5 months and this is still not resolved. I am planning to open a lawsuit under European Union jurisdiction if I cannot find a resolution. This is completely unethical business practice, and I will never let this go away. I want my money back because I am at no fault. The airline canceled the flight. Not me. Travelgenio charged my credit card for the second time without my consent and authorization and they are not responding back to my inquiries. If this issue is not resolved soon, I will make sure they will pay for their fraudulent business.Edited: 11:27 pm, June 13, 2020 "
"Hi Suna, Thank you very much for contacting us. One of our specialised agents will study your case. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travel2be.com, from the e-mail you indicated when making the reservation, mentioning only the Booking ID (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail) in the subject and we will inform you of the next steps."
"Suna: why not go back to your credit card again? It worked once, why not again?"
That is more sensible than pursuing legal action.
"The TravelGenio bot that tells you send an e-mail to customer.service@travel2be.com is useless. I send the email, it routs me to TravelGenio website to fill out another form. I fill out the form, then no one ever contacts me."
"Another update: I called the airlines. They told me that no travel agency has ever requested a refund. Airlines verified from their system that no one has ever contacted them to request a refund on behalf of me. For all this time (3 months since I started requesting refund), Travelgenio/Travelbe has been lying to me and having me await a refund request that they have never sent to the Airline. This company is a complete fraud."
"It is easier for them to do nothing than to do something. Dispute the charges againEdited: 4:55 am, June 15, 2020 "
"I genuinely don't know where to begin with Travel2Be/TravelGenio. I booked a flight (Vancouver - Montreal) in late January 2020, before the Coronavirus restrictions hit. When my flight was cancelled I was not sent an email or notified in anyway. I notified Travel2Be myself that I would not be able to make the flight since I would not be able to enter Canada. I requested a refund as was due since I had not cancelled the flight myself. Almost 4 months since my due flight departure date, after leaving 5 tickets with Travel2Be, many many phone calls not answered, several emails, and attempts to seek out their customer service agents through social media platforms, I have stilll not been refunded. All I have received is a single email two months ago now asking me (and others) to stop creating tickets as it would only create more work for them. No part of this email was personal to me or my case. This is infuriating and ridiculous. I am currently (16/June/2020) on hold with their customer services. This is my third call today since my first call ended after 10 minutes and my mobile phone losing €20 worth of credit, my second call ended after almost 20 minutes and that mobile house phone dying... now I am 45 minutes into call three. I can't imagine what charge this has incurred. If you're reading this, never, I mean NEVER book with Travel2Be or TravelGinio. I am so very close to going to the small claims court with this issue. If Travel2Be/TravelGinio are reading this, give me my damn refund already.Regards,Niall"
"Niall:This company has more red flags than the entire Soviet Union. Why you ever chose to give your money to such incompetents is beyond me.Hang up the phone. You won't reach anyone and you are just wasting money.Dispute the charges with your credit card company and pray they come thru for you. Your alternative is to wait, likely many months, to hear anything from this company.We have over 10,000 complaints on them. No one has reported hearing anything from them, nevermind a refund or voucher, in months.I cannot fathom why you would give so much money to strangers on the internet without doing any research. You found this FOUR YEAR OLD THREAD today without much trouble. I assure you this thread was here in January, just quite a bit shorter but still as much of a warning."
"I admit I should have done more research into how poor their customer service is before booking with them, but I had booked through them in the past without issue. They are usually cheaper than booking direct through an airline and funding has been an issue for me. The reason I came across this thread today is because I decided to add to these warnings for the sake of others. So I have reasons for booking through them and I've now learned my lesson. I will not be giving up on this refund though. Regards,Niall"
"I hope you saved enough in the prior bookings to cover any losses here.Dispute with your credit card. I repeat: 10,000 complaints here, no one is getting thru to the company or getting a reply or refund. Don't put good money after bad"
"Niall, we must follow airline procedures and this can take some time without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline makes the refund, from Travelgenio we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travelgenio.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive instructions to contact one of our agents."
"And Niall, not a single airline has seemed to refund the money to TravelGenio in order for them to return it to their customers.Not a one.What are the odds?I think TG has one employee and their job is to post her. And do nothing else."
"It's very good of you to want to warn others against using this company but most of the people who need to see the warning won't even look. Maybe, like you, they have used them before and not yet had any problems.Of course, there's always the chance that someone will come across the end of this very long thread, but to be realistic, most people looking here will already be aware of Travelgenio, Travel2Be and how awful they are.I suspect you know know enough about them to ignore their stock reply. Don't waste any more time, money and effort trying to contact this shambles of a company, go to your card provider nd let them sort it out for you."
"I have a different opinion than the previous posters in that I think that the flight which was cancelled was your flight into Canada, and that the flight booked through T2b from YVR to YUL would have still gone ahead as it was not affected by the border restrictions on entry to Canada. In which case you cancelled the flight and that would be then subject to the rules pertaining to your booking.I would bet you had non-refundable tickets and are therefore not entitled to any refund."
"Hi,I hope you are doing very well. I want to update you that because of your bad customer service I unable  to get my flight .I call Friday about confirmation of my flight because Covid19 I want to make sure it is on time so your agent told me that it is on time and your ticket is confirmed with Alitalia Airline operated by Etihad airways so just double check with Alitalia airways I call them and they gave me Reference  number of Ethiad airways JMDHKV so I call Etihad airways they said that flight is on time butt my ticket status is showing  Unconfirmed so please  call your main airline they can confirm  it so I call Alitalia airways and they said its showing  confirm from their side so call you agent Tavel2be they will check it I call them again your customer  service and they said its comforim because you got E Ticket number:055-3835516084 so you should not worry at all as I been expecting email for online check -in email  before 24 hours butt I did not receive  any email so I been worried about it than I call again on Alitalia airways they again said its confirm so I can check in at airport.when I reached airport I tried to check in they said that your ticket is showing  Not confirmed  so please  confirm it first than come back to us I call Etihad airways customer  service  they told  same thing than I tried to call Alitalia airways  butt unfortunately  not customer available at flight  time 1AM so I tried to call at your customer service travel2be its waiting time 2 hours and it's been hold so I been stuck at airport because  of your negligence and misinformation.i been helpless and under stress at this late night time.Me and my family was in mental pain because  of this hectic scenario.

"I will also never use Travel2be for future flights. In early January 2020, we purchased flights for two different summer trips abroad. Due to the Covid 19 pandemic, we decided to cancel our summer trips. Every airline we booked through had no problem giving us a full refund. Our mistake was using Travel2be.com to purchase our second destination's return flight. The best they could do was offer us flight vouchers for the two return trips at a cost of $100. You would think that during a time of global crisis a company would be more understanding and at least offer flight vouchers free of charge, instead of trying to take more of your money. Never again!"
"You are lucky you got anything from them. We have over 20,000 complaints about them here going back many years . Most folks got nothing.If they gave you your money back they would quickly go bankrupt. It would be nice, but it isn’t realistic. Why ever would you have chosen them in the first place with all the Complaints all over the internet?Edited: 5:41 pm, July 10, 2020 "
"Jaime T, if you need to check the general conditions accepted during the booking process, you have them available in our site. There you can find the mentioned service fees for any change, refund, voucher, etc."
More excuses. Only time we hear from you lot is when you are criticised. You still owe me over 400 pounds from a flight cancelled months ago by Aeroflot. Bunch of thieving cowboys who should not be allowed to trade.
"Travel2be ,is imposible to conect with you by the customer service email I send it so many emails and nothing no response at all,my flight was cancel in march because of the covid 19,I am waiting for my refund since then.please give me any other email so I can write again.thanks"
"If you have sent many e-mails, then you are part of the cause of the problem. Somebody has to stop processing refunds to read the incoming mail.There is no known way of contacting Travel2Be."

"Carolina C, If you have followed the procedure and registered your request through the link, our agents will contact you as soon as possible. Cheers"
"I highly recommend NOT to ever use Travel2Be. My flight was cancelled in April 2020 due to coronavirus. Trying to get a credit or refund is impossible. They want me to pay a fee for the service of trying to get a refund (no guarantees) - fine. But the process they have asked me to do online will not accept my credit card details. I have tried multiple times and on different computers and different browsers. Funny how this does not happen when they are trying to get money out of you for your original service. So I contact their customer service and weeks later they just copy and paste the original instructions, which do not work. There is no phone number on their website. I have been applying for refunds and credits from multiple companies due to coronavirus and this this one is the worst!"
"Thank you Yviess for your comment. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travel2be.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8-digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive instructions to contact one of our specialised agents."
"Dispute it with you credit card, Y.Don’t give them more money. You picked the worst company to deal with, now run away fast."
"I am posting this so that everyone can see what a bunch of cowboys this company is. DO NOT USE THEM. They withhold funds that do not belong to them . My flights were cancelled months ago and still they refuse to hand over the money. Bypass them and contact the relevant European Authoroties and you can find the CEO's details online too. Bombard him with emails as I will be. They will not refund you if you do not push them and I'm still having trouble with them. Book through airlines directly, do not use travel2be or travelgenio (same company) let's put these people out of business."
"KevinThere are already hundreds of threads and at least 20,000 posts warning people about Travel2Be and Travelgenio. Your post is just another grain of sand on the beach, and will have absolutely no effect."
"Hi Kevin, Talking about refunds, we are constantly contacting airlines to be able to make them effective the sooner the best. Anyway, we must follow their procedures and this can take some months without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline approves the refund, from Travel2be we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase. Please send an e-mail to customer.service@travel2be.com, from the e-mail address you used to make the reservation and indicating the Booking ID in the subject (8digit code that appears in the confirmation e-mail), and you will receive instructions to contact one of our agents."
"Kevin,Ever dawn on you that they don't yet have your funds. People have waited months for a refund direct, so these companies (as the airline's customer) will be in exactly the same boat. Oh, and pray tell, which are the relevant authorities?"
"Kevin posts his story here every few weeks. It's a sad one, but one we have read thousands of times. I'm not sure how bombarding the CEO with emails helps, has it helped you, Kevin?"
"Absolute rubbish. Aeroflot cancelled these flights at the end of February!! The 20th of July was the date of departure and there were no flights! I've contacted you customer (terrible) services many times and I get nothing from them but lies! I'm better off slating you on here, as I at least get a response. S5EACE Stay away people."
The relevant authoroties are easy to find if you look hard enough. I've been waiting since February!
"Kevin,I don't need to, nor do I care t, look. I was merely interested in which authorities would deal with online intermediaries flogging airline tickets to cheapskates over the internet? It's just that I'm not aware of any. You don't seem very happy."
Rave on!
So Kevin’s still not named these relevant authorities?
"No, Kevin seems to expect us to find them ourselves, even though we don't need them because we haven't been caught out using a rubbish company without doing proper research.I think Kevin is right to be annoyed with this mob, but his actions don't seem to be getting him anywhere, which is something I find pretty predictable."
"Kevin J, as soon as airline approves and manages the refund for cancelled tickets and we receive them we will be more than pleased to transfer them. You have all the info to contact us if needed. Regards"
Worst travel agents and worst customer service. I normally don't complain but I have been waiting on my refund from last 6 months and they are not helpful at all. I have called them more than 10 times and all I hear is that your refund is in process and CSR's are rude. I would never recommend this company to anyone.

"They aren't a travel agency, Sanjay. They are a ticket seller. They do nothing that you cannot do yourself, but you can do it easier and with more safety by just booking directly with the airline. An agency has people and customer service. T2B has computers and no service."

"Hi BE425, As soon as we receive airline's refund in our systems after their approval for each case we will be pleased to transfer it to the same account used in the booking process"
"Has the airline confirmed to you that they have issued the refund to Travel2be? Third parties do not refund until they receive the funds back from the airline. Some airlines are taking months to refund - there are people that booked direct with airlines still waiting for refunds from March, April etcTheir communication and after sales service is terrible but that is nothing new - there have been warnings for years"
Hello. My flight has been cancelled by the company. I bought a ticket through your agency and there is notheng about refund and nobody answers me on my mail. I want my money back and you cannot just refuse to give me my money back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"gaga: You chose to give your money to one of the worst companies out there. This thread has been here for FOUR YEARS with nearly 1000 posts warning you away.When you give your money to incompetent companies you should expect bad things to happen. You have to find threads like this BEFORE you give your money away.You can try to see if your credit card company can help you get a refund, but if they can't, you have a very long wait ahead of you and you may not see your money again. Be more careful picking companies in the future!"
"gaga.rulic@gmail.com, Talking about refunds, we are constantly contacting airlines to be able to make them effective the sooner the best. Anyway, we must follow their procedures and this can take some months without, unfortunately, being able from the travel agencies to shorten these deadlines. Once each airline approves the refund, from Travel2be we will transfer it to the same credit card used during the purchase."
"Well... are you reading internet prior to all of your purchases? When you use Expedia, Orbitz, Skyscanner, etc... and land in a travel agency to complete your transaction, wouldn't you trust the big travel search companies as noted above. So clearly, THIS IS ALSO SKYSCANNER'S FAULT... For the last 4 years, they must have received complaints about Travelbe/TravelGenio... And yet, Skyscanner still works with this unethical travel agency. That is what happened to us. We trusted Skyscanner and ended up with this fraudulent and irresponsible Travelgenio/Travelbe company.As Travelgenio requested, I opened a ticket. They never updated me. By the way, US Department of Transportation accepted my complaint about Travelgenio and forwarded my complaint to the Airlines. Next, they will face a lawsuit. They will end up some serious fines and a ban by a number of airlines. All they needed to do was to properly follow up with the customers whose money they have blocked, and update the customers as they promised. They are a fraud business, and they will pay for their unethical practices. The last thing we need during the COVID pandemic is companies who are leeching on people.Edited: 3:18 pm, July 31, 2020 "
"The fault is in your mirror, BE. Skyscanner is an advertising site. Just like TripAdvisor, Google, Late night TV, that telephone pole down the street, and the newspaper.NONE of them check to make sure the companies that advertise there are legit, they just make sure the check is good (other than the telephone pole which doesn't get paid). It is YOUR JOB as a consumer to do a bit of research to make sure you are giving your money to legitimate companies. T2B is not a good company and hasn't been for many years. Five minutes of research back when you chose them should have scared you away. I am not sure how you became such a good consumer advocate in the past month or so because you really dropped the ball back when you gave them your money."
"“clearly, THIS IS ALSO SKYSCANNER'S FAULT... ”You really should not be using the Internet as you clearly don’t know how Skyscanner works. It is a search engine that searches for flights. It does not vet any of the links or adverts on the site. Many agencies are paid adverts. It’s similar to Google, the links are there and it is up to you to do your own research and due diligence. It was you who decided to use T2B, it was you who clicked on the link, not Skyscanner.Before I hand over money to a site I do not know I research who I’m handing it over to. Do you hand money over to a stranger in the street who offers you a cheap airfare? I guess not, so why hand money over to an unknown web site on the internet? And yes, i do do my research first before handing over my money.May be you need some lessons on how to use the Internet and in future book direct with the airline, so much easier to cut out the middleman.Edit. NT, our same thoughts crossed, Will the poster get the idea and look in a mirror!Edited: 3:46 pm, July 31, 2020 "
Considering we both work for T2B and sit next to each other it is likely we would have the same reply.Please pass that delicious beverage over to me when you can!
"NT, maybe we need to change tactics and have a 30 min delay Between replies, then we might not be found out.Have a good day!"
"You should answer on my mail and tell me how many days approximatelly i will wai for refund, or anything, just answer to know. I don't have money for waisting"
"Gaga: they don’t Reply to emails. They never have, they never will. You could have found this out before you rushed to give them your money but you didn’t do any research.There are MANY bad companies on the internet who will rip you off. You need to be careful always"
"Guess what... I contacted the airlines... and they told me that no travel agency ever contacted them to issue a refund... apparently these guys are displaying on their website that they are awaiting for airline to approve the refund EVEN THOUGH they have never requested the refund!!! Also, airline confirmed that T2B did NOT use my credit card number to book the ticket... and that the T2B used their own credit card for the transaction with the airline... so airline would not be able to issue a refund back to me now because my credit card is not there in the transaction... what type of shady scheme is this?!!!"
"Of course they didn’t use your credit card. You would have seen that charge if they had. If they used your cc then both TG and the airline would have charged you.and you would know how much TG actually pays for tickets, info they don’t want you to have.And no surprise they haven’t requested a refund. They will get around to it, eventually.YOur expectations continue to be unreasonable. Understand that you walked into the center of town, found the village Idiot, and asked him to buy you a plane ticket.Edited: 2:12 pm, August 01, 2020 "
"@NT, what do you mean with ""They will get around to it, eventually.""? (It's been 4.5 months since my flight got cancelled, and more than 3 months I have opened a ticket with T2B requesting a refund.)"
"Exactly what NT said ""eventually"" BE425 - some airlines are quoting up to 90 days to process refund themselves and as you did not book the flights the refund goes back to the agent . The agent will not do anything until the money is passed to them at which point the clock will start ticking down again as things at their end are presumably being dealt with in order of receipt of funds (not the date that customers first aske for a refund) so ""how long"" is a question nobody will be able to answer.As for your comment in Post 932 "" ...Also, airline confirmed that T2B did NOT use my credit card number to book the ticket... and that the T2B used their own credit card for the transaction with the airline... so airline would not be able to issue a refund back to me now because my credit card is not there in the transaction... what type of shady scheme is this?!!!…."" this reveals a fundamental misunderstanding on your part of the process of buying flight tickets through an agent as you have done . YOU chose to insert an agent into the process so when the agent buys the tickets from the airline they use their business account card - that Isn't shody practice -, it happens all the time when you book through online ticket floggers like T2B . Unfortunately if things then go wrong the payment route is reversed - the airline refunds the agent onto the card used to pay for the tickets, and the agent then (eventually) refunds their own customer (you) .onto the card you paid them with in the first place . That final refund will of course be less any fees T2B is are entitled to charge you according to the contract you entered into with them"
"BE425, would you please let us know exactly how much cheaper your tickets were, as opposed to directly from the airline?Edited: 5:10 pm, August 01, 2020 "
"Refunds depend on airline, that's why we cannot give an approximate time, because we cannot manage them until they authorise and refund them through our systems. Thanks"
"Eventually means I hope you see your money by the end of next year. But it may be gone forever. That’s what happens when you give your money to random strangers who tell you that they can save you money. You didn’t do a lick of research to see what up kind of people you were giving your money to, and that has consequences.Every story doesn’t have a happy ending."
"Thank you all for your valuable comments and insight. The flight was an international flight. Based on the PNR codes I see on the itinerary, there are 3 airlines in 4 legs of the flight. Do you know if TG/T2B would submit refund request to all 3 airlines separately (nightmare scenario for my refund!) -OR- there would be a primary airlines to whom TG/T2B would submit the refund request? I called 1 of these airlines and that airline told me the amount of my refund *if* TG/T2B would submit a refund request on my behalf. Problem #1 is the amount I am told is a little more than the total amount I paid, which makes me think that, separate refunds are being prepared by each airline. Problem #2 is, of course, that airline told me that they have not received any refund request from TG/T2B. (Even though TG/T2B website shows the status as ""We are awaiting airline's approval"")... When I send a follow-up inquiry TG/T2B, the response I now get is ""there has already been an entry, please do not contact us again""."

"I booked my flight with Air Caraibes to flight to Reunion through Paris in November 2019 using the travel agency Travel2Be. My flight was cancelled by the airline in late March. I receive a message saying that I can reschedule my flight for later. Then the situation with covid-19 got really bad and the EU issued a travel ban for all US citizens. I contacted Travel2Be to explain the situation to them and it took them a long time to reply saying that I have one year from the date of original purchase to use my tickets or I would lose them. I then tried to fill out a refund form on Air Caraibes. The site did not work and there was no email or number to contact them.I reply to the cancellation email, once again explaining the situation and asking them if they could extend the ticket to 2021. Their answer was use it by November 2020 or lose them.The airline cancelled the flight and this was out of their control but I also have not control over the travel ban. How are they expecting me to flight if I am banned from entering the EU and there are no end date for the ban?I have tried several emails and have received the same answer: use them by November or your lost. Best wishes. Are you kidding me? They basically took my money, didn’t provide any service and they won’t give it back.Both Travel2BE and Air Caraibes are horrible and dishonest companies. I will never ever use them or any companies associated with them.These companies are taking people’s money and then asking the government to bail them out. Who is going to bail the customer’s out? The customers who lost their money and probably have been affected greatly by the pandemic.If I don’t get my money back from these companies, I hope that no on uses them and they go bankrupt because the way they do business is unethical. I do feel bad for their employees who are probably told to say the same thing to all the customers: use your ticket or lose. Sorry."
"I can't speak for the airline, Kim, but 900 posts here over many years suggests that Travel2Be is as bad as you say it is. 20,000 other posts here at TripAdvisor suggests the same thing.You MUST do research before you give your money to awful companies. ""Hoping"" that no one uses them is naive. We have all these posts here and YOU used them.You need to tell your friends and post on Facebook and Tweet and reach the people like you who don't do research and are swayed by a ""cheap fare"" from a terrible company. That's the only way to cut the head off of the snake.Edited: 9:28 am, August 12, 2020 "
"#941 - Kim GHad you have booked through the airline direct,and not through this Shonky you could have done a charge back through your credit card.Fear not,the TravelGenio Bot will be along soon....just to tell you how silly you were booking with its company..."
"Kim G, we follow airline guidelines. As a third party we cannot offer nothing they do not authorise. Any further details regarding the conditions they give us for your case will only be provided as a reply to our last mails. Regards"
TravelgenioI raised issue online request (reference number 3987382) weeks ago and still no response. I have also email customer.service@travelgenio.com (booking code 17165773) and also no response. Can someone please respond.thanksRay
"If you have followed the procedure and registered your request through the link, our agents will contact you as soon as possible. Cheers"
"Definitive proof there that ""as soon as possible"" means weeks if not months.Ray, keep your fingers crosses that they get in touch by Christmas. Christmas 2022 that is."
"#945' I have also email customer.service@travelgenio.com'That should read customer.lackof.service.comRay,have you learned a lesson from this? Learned to book direct with the airline,not some Shonky useless third party?"
"BE CAREFUL buying tickets via travel2be and travel genio, i bought plane tickets through them and due to the covid -19 outbreak, i canceled the ticket and applied for a refund to United Airlines. United Airlines has approved the request for refund and the refund has been paid to travel2be but they did not return the money to me.They cannot be contacted by phone or email, the emails they send are always ""no reply"" email."
"I've had the same issue with this company for months now. Almost given up on getting my money back now, but I'll hang in there. To be honest, Aeroflot are just as bad."
"Ypsan: As Kevin knows we have well over 20,000 complaints about these companies going back YEARS!As the thread title says: Buyer Beware. You HAVE to do research and find threads like this before you give away your money to strangers."
"Too true. I made a bad mistake. However, that doesn't give them or AEROFLOT the right not to refund me does it."
"The right? No. But there's really nothing you can do about it other than try a chargeback, post on social media, and warn your friends.You lie down with dogs like T2B, you are going to get fleas"
"It's got nothing to do with Aeroflot, Kevin. Having chose to use Travel2Be your contract is with the agent not the airline. Aeroflot have kept to their side of things if they have refunded the agency.Definitely hang on in there, though. Try your card provider, it won't hurt."
"Hi Ypsan,How did you find out United Airlines paid the refund to travel2be?1. Was there an update on Travel2be website?2. Was there an email from Travel2be about the refund progress?3. Did you call United?I am in the same situation as you are.5 months after my flight was canceled and 4 months after I requested my refund, they sent me an email saying my refund went into indirect refund process and it would take longer than usual! I guess this mean I have to wait 6 more months? 1 more year? I have no idea. No transparency whatsoever... A delayed refund is one thing but not being able to track what is going on and not being able to reach to their customer service is just awful.I regret giving my money to this company."
"#955'I regret giving my money to this company.'As did the previous 954 replies on this thread.....and the thousands of others on the many other threads on this board.Simply dispute the payment with your card provider,giving them all the evidence of attempted contacts with this company.The TravelGenio Bot will soon be here....telling you that only a fool would book with its company....sensible people avoid all online ticket floggers,and book direct with the airline...."
"BE425, I doubt very much that the answer to your question will have anything to do with Travel2Be. The information about the refund will have come from the airline. It's impossible to predict when your money will come through. tim's advice is good. Contact your card provider and ask if they can help you."
"Tim and Rojblake, my credit company literally sold me off. They found the slightest chance to discontinue the dispute. This was UBER visa card with Barclay's. Stay away from this credit card. Their dispute process will NOT protect you in any way."
"Barclay's reversed the initial disputed credit without notifying me. By the time I found out Travel2be charged me for the second time (dispute reversal), I missed the 10 days window to re-open a dispute, and Barclay's told me they will NOT continue the dispute. All Travel2be had to do to reverse the dispute credit was simply to tell Barclay's that the charge was valid and the consumer accepted Travel2be's cancellation policy at the time of the ticket purchase. Barclay's took only this explanation from Travel2be to reverse the disputed credit without notifying me. I found out about this 11-12 days after which was outside of 10 days window. Again... please make yourself a favor and stay away from Barclay's UBER Visa credit card at least for travel purposes."
"I think you have highlighted why getting a card provider involved is not a guarantee of getting your refund any quicker. But I'm a little confused as to the reason given by TG to Barclays. Are the saying that due to their policies there is no refund due? Or is it more that they are in the process of doing your refund, and it's just taking longer than usual?"
"It is extremely generic and vague explanation from Barclays. At the end of this post, I am copying and pasting what Barclay's explanation was to reverse the credit in favor of Travelgenio. As you can see, Travelgenio tricked Barclays as if I was requesting a refund on a non-refundable ticket where I did not want to fly..... In reality, airline cancelled the flight, but this fact was masked by travelgenio..... and Barclays did NOT care to protect my consumer right even though I explained them it was the airline, and not me, who cancelled the flight and I am eligible for a timely full refund.... BARCLAYS DISPUTE LETTER:""Unfortunately, we're unable to pursue credit on your behalf for this particular transaction(s) for the following reason: ***>>> We are unable to override the merchant's no refund cancellation policy that was agreed to when making the purchase. <<< *** While we are unable to assist you in pursuing credit for this transaction(s), we recommend you contact the merchant directly to see if there are other options to resolve your claim.""Edited: 2:04 pm, August 22, 2020 "
"All I can say it is not only the travel agency you should be careful about but you should also give business to a credit card that would protect your credit consumer rights.Barclays UBER Visa card does brand positioning as a travel credit card..... but their dispute process is AWFUL.... My experience would have been MUCH different, had I used my AMEX instead of Barclays UBER Visa card.I regret giving my money to Travelgenio...... I regret using my Barclays UBER Visa.....Hope you dont make the same mistakes.."
Elevate your claim at Barclays.
How? (Please help if there is a way!)That was Barclays US who rejected my claim.Uber Visa is a credit card issued by Barclays US
"#964Sometimes you just got to give up on something.You picked a bad card provider,and an even worse travel company.Move on,not backward,learn from it,and do not use agents again...book direct."
"Call them up, ask for a supervisor or a manager. Go to Chris Elliott’s site to get names/numbers/email info"
I think it's worth pursuing this with Barclays US. If the flight was cancelled by the airline then you have not received what you paid for through no fault of your own. Be perfectly clear that you didn't cancel anything so it's not a question of overriding the cancellation policies at all.
