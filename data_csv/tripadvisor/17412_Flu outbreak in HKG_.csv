There have been so many reports in Canada that there's a flu outbreak in HKG right now. I've heard a few children have died. What's going on? Is there an epidemic? We are heading to HKG next week and would like to exercise caution as necessary. Please inform. Thanks!
Follow former HK 1st lady's advice: Wash you hands... repeat 3 times.Reports in Canada didn't say there's a flu outbreak. TVB satellite news or HK newspaper never said that either. Take your flu shots (though it's pretty late in the season so they might have run out in Vancouver)
"Excuse my ignorance...what's TVB? Is that a Chinese station? We only watch and listen to English TV like CTV, CBC, and Global news.All the Chinese people we know have been telling me about the flu outbreak. There was even someone warning me about the possibility that one of the children sick had meningitis. We just want to be informed. That's all.As for washing hands, my family is very good with that. We use soap and sing the Happy Birthday song before we rinse with warm water. We also use paper towels to touch door handles in case others aren't as diligent about washing their hands with soap and water."
"Perhaps you can help us with the ""so many reports"" part since we're not learing any of that in our local media here.Generally, keeping your fingers out of your mouth, nose and eyes is a good first line defence against all sorts of health issues.For Hong Kong specifically, you might want to read:…cdc.gov/travel/destinationHongKongSAR.aspxA list of travel clinics in your area (where you can get flu and other shots) is available here:phac-aspc.gc.ca/tmp-pmv/travel/clinic-eng.php"
"Since the weekend, every Chinese relative or Chinese friend I have encountered has given us the ""flu outbreak"" alert. They have been listening to the Chinese television media (hence the reports I am talking about). I am concerned because I am travelling with children. I also want to be informed.I am hoping a HKG local can tell just what the current situation is and whether the media is just hyping it up to something more than it really is."
"Reports are exaggerated. Yes there has been two deaths of young children, and one school has been closed as a precaution, but this is the flu season, and so in many respects no different from previous years in terms of the number of flu cases.As someone else said, wash hands frequently and eat healthily and you will be fine. Basically bad news sells newspapers - and the HK newspapers are as guilty as others for exaggerating the seriousness of the situation."
"According to today's South China Morning Post, three children have died, but only one appears to have had flu and nobody's really sure about the other two.There are hundreds if not thousands of people with flu in Canada right now too - as there are every year. It's not an epidemic, it's normal. Call me a cynic, but the media need to hype up every news story to make it entertaining."
TVB = Hongkong TV station. They have daily satellite news available in Canada. I am watching/reading the same HK media as your relatives but I do not see an outbreak or epidemic. 
"It is true that several young children have died. But the cause is still non-conclusive. It could be flu, or flu-complications, or something else - new or unknown yet.Exercise caution but not to be too worried about it at the moment. "
"""What's going on?""No more than a slightly raised rate in the normal number of infections. I wouldn't let this influence your trip in any way. As others have said, the best thing you can do is regularly wash your hands. "
"Thanks so much for alleviating my fears about a flu outbreak. I am more relaxed now knowing that it is indeed the media hyping it up. I'm sure now that it's no more than the numbers of people with the flu in Canada. And yes, there's a stomach flu making its rounds again here. So take note of that if you plan on making a trip here to Vancouver :-)"
"well, as a mother, I am very concerned. And having experienced the year of the SARS, I would be lying if I said I wasn't worried.Today, and along with 6 other mothers I know... with young children, we have kept our children at home from school today, we are 1 week away from Easter holidays. The media's news and report is only ""part"" of the facts and ""part"" of the truth. There is definitely more to the situation than we are told.However, it's not at the stage of panic. I think that is no use. Keep up with personal hygiene, stay away from very crowded and congested area/events, and maintain your health and immune system.While travelling here, having some antibacterial hand gels, and alcohol wipes would be a good idea."
Which part of the sitution are we not being told Kate?
"Thanks KateTam! Good tips. I will include antibacterial wipes, Purell, zinc/echinaecia, etc."
"drumdrake, I am afraid it's not open information.Will see what the government is going to do next.I have faith they learned their lesson from SARS.Not implying that this situation is ANYTHING like SARS. Not at all. No panic necessary.HK is still very safe to travel to, just take precautions with washing hands (more often), and stay healthy by eating well balanced diet, and exercise. Young children under 12, and anyone with weaker immune system, may need extra protection such as flu shot (although this one is not protected by the flu shot now)..... better than not being protected from the other strains.Antibacterial wipes, sanitizing gels, and children's masks are sold out in MANY pharmacies and watsons or mannings already.I was only able to buy 75% alcohol wipes from pharmarcies today, and adult masks."
"Hi all,I've just booked my air ticket to HKG. I'm quite worry that it will affect my trip. Kindly update if there is any news with regards to this matter. Thanks"
Just announced that ALL primary will be suspended for 2 weeks!!!!
ops...Primary School I meant
"I think they must have learnt their lessons from SARS, better be more cautious then under-estimating the flu outbreak. "
"All nurseries, kindergartens, and primary schools across HK will be closed tomorrow. Early Easter Holidays they call it. "
"But I still can't see what's behind all this panic. Flu outbreak, it happens every year, and public hospitals operating to its capacity is nothing new in HK, right?Maybe I'm among those stubborn citizens who will die first because of their short-sightness, but before that happens I don't see any reason for any activities or visits to HK be deterred in any way."
"Might as well close it, if I have kids, I wont bring them to school anyway."
just saw a news bulletin tonite - they're closing kindy and primary schools for two weeks starting tomorrow
What are the symptoms and how long will it last?
"I think most kids starts with the normal symtoms of flu, high temperatures etc etc....."
"Yes, Flu season is common, we all knew it's flu season ... and it would be extra lengthy this year. However, flu resulting deaths within 12 hours in young children is quite rare. Nothing is conclusive yet, but, friends and relatives in the medical fields and hospitals have called me to advise.... get your kid to wear masks.... and my doctor told me to keep my 2 year old at home, don't go to school.Does that sound like precautions and measures taken by the government for just a ""common flu ?"""
"Seriously... what does it mean if you keep your kids at home (or they have to say home because the primary schools are closed)?All reports are very inconclusive. They are talking in double-dutch.... they say one thing, but mean another. If it was really THAT bad, wouldn't they say that ALL schools should be closed? What about MTR's, Buses and Secondary Schools?IMO, it is just the government trying to be nice. They don't know what is happening, but they are playing SUPER CAUTIOUS. Even at the height of the SARS ""epidemic"", there were not that many reported SARS cases. I think this is just the goverment being overly cautious."
"I think it's ""cautious"" move from the government, but NOT overly cautious. (I am speaking from a mother of 2 children under 5.)I think the reason secondary schools are not being closed is because these students have more knowledge and common sense about personal hygiene, and their education progress have a lot more at stake.And, the deaths have been children under 7 years old.Can be prevented by washing hands more frequently. Very different from SARS threat."
i just wonder though - are children really kept at home during this two week suspension of classes?hk homes are not exactly palatial and im sure that kids (and their parents) will be bored being stuck at home - and they could go while the time at the malls or playground.so i wonder if this is really a sure measure to prevent the flu from spreading....
"well, no, I won't be putting my kids in a ""vacuum"" for 2 weeks... however, I think by closing the schools, it gives us parents a choice.With the amount of hours my child stays at school, and with that many children in one classroom for a lengthy period of time, 5 days a week... it is the most common place to pick up a virus or cold.... AND, it's the only place where I cannot keep an eye on them.With going out to a shopping center, or playground, I can wash their hands immediately afterwards....I can't say it's going to prevent it from spreading... but it's certainly a start."
"My daughter (teacher in Shenzhen) e-mailed me just a little while ago saying that all schools (but perhaps she meant primary) were closed in Hong Kong for two weeks and that two children had died. She said that there is also flu at the school where she teaches but it doesn't seem any more unsual an outbreak than what we would have here in the States. Her opinion was that because the population is just so dense that it makes sense to close the schools so it doesn't keep spreading. Ironically, she e-mailed us within 15 minutes of our return from a Doctors office after getting Hep A shots and declining a flu vaccine."
"As a Doctor,I can tell you that this avian flu has serious potential to cause a pandemic. Don't forget, 5 yrs ago,the avian flu claimed 500 lives in Hong Kong. It would be naive to think that simple precautions like hand washing and wearing mask will protect you.As far as I am concerned, I will not be going to that part of the world anytime soon."
"tunnu,Um, just what kind of a doctor did you say you were exactly?Avian flu has had 330 confirmed cases worldwide since 1996, so hard to see how 500 PEOPLE could die of it in Hong Kong. Of course, I'm talking human cases, and maybe you're a vetrenarian and you're talking 500 dead...uh... birds?????Maybe you should read this report from the CDC:cdc.gov/flu/…avian-flu-humans.htmOr maybe you meant to say the next human pandemic might well be caused by a mutation in avian flu which allows aerosol transmission from human to human. (No cases of human infecting human have yet been established so far as I am aware.)Seems to me the authorities in Hong Kong are just being prudent until they establish whether there is anything happening out of the ordinary (for that reason, I don't suggest people like Katetam are over reacting).But again, the number one defence against all sorts of illness is to keep your fingers out of your nose, mouth and eyes (or more commonly stated, don't touch your face or your food with your hands)."
"OK, ""Doctor"" Tunnu, so in 2003 ""avian flu claimed 500 lives in Hong Kong""? Care to provide us with any links to back up your bizarre claim? Surely a doctor wouldn't confuse SARS (which did kill around 300 in HK) with influenza... "
"Already posted this on the other thread, but worthwhile repeating here:Schools are not closed for two weeks.Fact: kindergartens and primary schools only have closed two DAYS early. They were going to be closed for two weeks for the Easter holidays anyway.Three children have died (according to South China Morning Post this morning, around 1000 people die every year as a result of flu and complications - this is normal compared with European and US figures) but nobody knows if these children even had the flu."
"I am having the same dilemna, I have been for the past 2 days surfing the net on news about the flu outbreak. In my case I have already paid for the tickets and our hotels are already confirmed, so that means it's non-refundable. Our schedule for the HK trip is next week and my 4 year old daughter is coming with us and she's really excited to go to disneyland, that's all she's been talking about for the past 2 weeks and we have planned for this trip since last 2007. I have asked my doctor for the flu vaccine but as of this date there is still no stock of the new flu vaccine in our country. What I really want is for someone specifically a mother with a 4 year old child living in HK who can tell me the real situation there and what are the odds of her catching the flu? Or someone who is also in the same situation as I am, who is also bringing a child, who will be travelling to HK also next week. I know it's a hard question to answer but please somebody help me. Any comment is really appreciated. We will be leaving on tuesday early morning, please I need your replies immediately. Thanks so much... "
No new flu virus found in dead children RTHK 2008-03-14 HKT 21:29Hong Kong Health officials say gene sequencing tests on the flu viruses taken from the seven-year-old boy and the three-year-old girl who died recently from respiratory ailments have confirmed that no new virus has emerged. It said the viruses of the two matched the genetic makeup of viruses that were already circulating in different parts of the world.
"There has never been a pandemic bird flu issue - so what kind of Doctor are you - PhD in what?! Are you confused with SARS, which was not bird flu?Last year in Australia several people died from flu - kids, healthy adults, and the aged - it happens every year, in every country. Do you escape from your own country when there is an outbreak?It is sensible to take precautions, like keeping kids home from school, isolating sufferers, etc etc. But that is it. "
"AFAIK no competent authority has issued official advisory against travel to HK.This following information was posted at the UK FCO web site:“Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has closed all kindergarten and primary schools in Hong Kong until after the Easter holidays. This has been done as a precaution to attempt to prevent further spread of a suspected influenza outbreak. Hong Kong is at the peak of it's flu season and the outbreak does not appear to be of a new strain. The situation in Hong Kong is calm. There is no reason to cancel any planned trips to Hong Kong but travellers should monitor the local press for any changes and maintain high standards of hygene throughout their stay.In the first half of 2007 there have been a few reported cases of Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) in Hong Kong but only in birds. No human infections or deaths have been reported. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has confirmed human cases elsewhere in the region and there have been some human fatalities in China. If you plan to visit China please also view the latest China Travel Advice.The risk to humans from Avian Influenza is believed to be very low. As a precaution, you should avoid visiting live animal markets, poultry farms and other places where you may come into close contact with domestic, caged or wild birds; and ensure poultry and egg dishes are thoroughly cooked.You should read this advice in conjunction with the Avian and Pandemic Influenza Factsheet, which gives more detailed advice and information.”Source: www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front…The notice specifically affirms that “there is no reason to cancel any planned trips to HK but travellers should monitor the local press for any changes and maintain high standards of hygene throughout their stay”.RichmondCA – No Official warning has been issued for HK by the Canadian government. However, you may want to check the Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada web site regularly for any update.Link: www.voyage.gc.ca/dest/report-en.asp…"
"""What I really want is for someone specifically a mother with a 4 year old child living in HK who can tell me the real situation there and what are the odds of her catching the flu?""Unless that ""mother with a 4 year old"" also happens to have research experience in the epidemiology of influenza, then it's difficult to know why you'd place any great importance on her advice. All the evidence suggests that the situation here is no more serious than the norm for this time of the year."
"Well, living in HK and travelling in HK are way different. People living there have to travel, every day in buses/trams etc; tourists dont. They have to go to schools and work places, tourists dont. My kids are older than four, but as it currently stands I would have no concerns about travelling there with them. When there is a flu outbreak in your area, do you leave? Hardly, they happen every year, you just need to take sensible precautions. Some people here are acting like HK is the only place that gets flu! Too weird, stay home but stay away from the next person in your neighbourhood that sneezes, they may have the flu!"
"Though I started this thread with the utmost concern for my children, I am no longer that concerned. I refuse to be sucked into the mass hysteria that is being formed by an overreacting media machine.We are leaving early Tuesday morning (just like Troubled Mom). We are going to enjoy ourselves. We will wash our hands religiously, bring Purell waterless hand sanitizer, and sanitizing wipes to wipe dirty surfaces. We talked with our family doctor about it. The flu in HKG is no different than the flu that is currently going around here in Canada. It is important that you approach the situation rationally and in an informed way. It was wise for the schools to close 2 days early for Easter break. That's not such a big deal. We had a few schools shut down here for a week due to an extensive outbreak of the norovirus in January. Flu is all over and that is the reality of the winter to spring transition. As everyone says, take the necessary precautions. Eat lots of veggies and fresh fruit, and build up your immune system before you leave."
A voice of reason from RichmondCA. Enjoy your trip.
"I am an expat living in Hong Kong.About a week ago our HR department warned of a HK flu outbreak and cleaning of surfaces like lift buttons was stepped up, masks were made freely available and Ribena with high vitamin C content offered free of charge in the office.Since then 3 preschoolers have died and a further 17 people (mainly kids) have been diagnosed. This is a strong flu NOT bird flu and not SARS. The cases are mainly in the New Territories (near where I live and work) however the kids had no known connections and are from a large number of different schoolsOn Wednesday night as a precaution it was decided that all primary and pre schools would close for two weeks. Most would have been closed for most of this period for Easter anyway so it is just a few extra days. Apparently this flu can take 7 days to incubate so 14 days off should break the cycle and stop any kind of epidemic.I went to work expecting lots of mums to be away and more masks than usual but was surprised to see no evidence of panic of any kind especially as HKers are quite paranoid particularly since SARS.It is very common for people to wear masks when they re sick, this is the protect colleagues rather than themselves so as nobody in our office is sick, nobody was earing a mask. Many families have maids so additional holidays for the kids does not mean extra time off work for parents.I have been into central several times this weekend and noticed no change to the number of people wearing masks. Most public buildings have stepped up their cleaning though.There is no need to change your travel plans, the government is just being cautious and rightly so.SARS pretty much ended when the weather got warmer. HK has just had its longest cold spell since 1968 (26 days) and a long winter so it is not surprising immunity is running low. It is now getting warmer and this flu will pass."
"TYPES OF FLUThere are three types of flu viruses: A, B, and C. Type A and B cause the ANNUAL influenza epidemics that have up to 20% of the population sniffling, aching, coughing, and running high fevers. Type C also causes flu; however, type C flu symptoms are much less severe.Each year, the flu is linked to an average of 36,000 deaths and 114,000 hospitalizations in the United States. Hong Kong influenza - strain of Influenza A Russian influenza - a 1978 epidemic. Spanish influenza - an epidemic in 1918. Asian influenza - a strain of Influenza A in 1957. Swine flu - an epidemic in 1976, in the United States Avian flu - a chicken flu in Hong Kong in 1997.BIRD FLU should not be confused with pandemic flu. Bird flu (Bird flu caused by H5N 1 virus) is largely in birds and spread by preparing diseased birds, handling fighting cocks, playing with poultry, consumption of duck's blood, and eating of undercook poultry.Pandemic Flu versus Season Flu - What are the differences? Flu itself is generally not regarded as a serious illness (except those in the risk groups) and self limiting in effect. Pandemic flu is different from ""normal seasonal flu"" in that: We do not know specifically when it will happen, though signs suggest that this may happen soon.=========HK FLU 2008 is THE NORMAL SEASONAL FLU"
"5678 wrote:""Bird flu (Bird flu caused by H5N 1 virus) is largely in birds and spread by preparing diseased birds, handling fighting cocks, playing with poultry, consumption of duck's blood, and eating of undercook poultry.""No authority is quoted so I would respond by saying from everything I have read, bird flu is only spread by bird poop (which is inhaled or otherwise enters the blood through, inhaling dried fecal material, cuts, getting it in your eyes or nose, but NOT by ingesting it!) There is no documented evidence of anyone ingesting the virus and getting sick. From the CDC website:http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/qa.htm  ""Can I get avian influenza from eating or preparing poultry or eggs?You cannot get avian influenza from properly handled and cooked poultry and eggs.There currently is no scientific evidence that people have been infected with bird flu by eating safely handled and properly cooked poultry or eggs.Most cases of avian influenza infection in humans have resulted from direct or close contact with infected poultry or surfaces contaminated with secretions and excretions from infected birds. Even if poultry and eggs were to be contaminated with the virus, proper cooking would kill it. In fact, recent studies have shown that the cooking methods that are already recommended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for poultry and eggs to prevent other infections will destroy influenza viruses as well.So to stay safe, the advice is the same for protecting against any infection from poultry: * Wash your hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw poultry and eggs. * Clean cutting boards and other utensils with soap and hot water to keep raw poultry from contaminating other foods. * Use a food thermometer to make sure you cook poultry to a temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit Consumers may wish to cook poultry to a higher temperature for personal preference. * Cook eggs until whites and yolks are firm."""
Authority?crisis.gov.sg/FLU/…http://wrongdiagnosis.com/f/flu/subtypes.htm
"how about the world health organization as an authority?All evidence to date indicates that close contact with dead or sick birds is the principal source of human infection with the H5N1 virus. Especially risky behaviours identified include the slaughtering, defeathering, butchering and preparation for consumption of infected birds. In a few cases, exposure to chicken faeces when children played in an area frequented by free-ranging poultry is thought to have been the source of infection.Should people stop eating poultry?No, but avoid eating sick or infected birds.  Always observe the following:Avoid eating poultry meat or eggs that are not properly cookedAvoid eating raw bloodCook all poultry meat (there should be no pink parts) and eggs thoroughly at high temperature.thorough cooking kills the virusetc etc=========Bird poop or not.... I think I will take the precautions that WHO recommended "
"Just want to say that we will be pushing through with our trip to HK, will be bringing masks, alcohol and antibacterial sprays just to be sure. For all those who responded to my post thanks much. "
"5678""All evidence to date indicates that close contact with dead or sick birds is the principal source of human infection with the H5N1 virus.""Wrong! (Unless you can give me a direct quote and reference that says otherwise.)Here's what the World Health Organizations says at:who.int/csr/…isthere""How do people become infected?Direct contact with infected poultry, or surfaces and objects contaminated by their faeces, is presently considered the main route of human infection. To date, most human cases have occurred in rural or periurban areas where many households keep small poultry flocks, which often roam freely, sometimes entering homes or sharing outdoor areas where children play. As infected birds shed large quantities of virus in their faeces, opportunities for exposure to infected droppings or to environments contaminated by the virus are abundant under such conditions. Moreover, because many households in Asia depend on poultry for income and food, many families sell or slaughter and consume birds when signs of illness appear in a flock, and this practice has proved difficult to change. Exposure is considered most likely during slaughter, defeathering, butchering, and preparation of poultry for cooking.""It's faeces, not blood that is the principal source for infection.Stay away from bird poop (or things contaminated with bird poop) and you'll be just fine.(We're on the same page on this one, which is, let's get the facts right and avoid hysteria over one or two or three recent and unfortunate deaths of children in Hong Kong (the flu kills many every year worldwide especially the young and the old) so people can be concerned about the things they should really be concerned about.)No. 1 line of defence. Keep your fingers out of your nose, eyes and mouth, or, more commonly stated, keep your hands away from your food and your face.No. 2 line of defence. Get your shots. Vaccines have saved untold suffering for years and yet many people still take the attitude, ""It won't happen to me."""
errrr i did get that off the world health organization website!
For anyone with travel plans to HK: don't worry. The flu in HK is the same as the flu in your home country and your chances of catching flu in HK are the same as catching flu at home. And if you catch the flu (whether at home or in HK) your chances of you or your children dying are the same no matter what country you're in (assuming you seek competent medical help) or where you caught it.I'd say that you're still far more likely to die in a car crash on your way to the airport in your home country than you are to catch the flu on holiday in HK.
" My cousin is going to HK this Saturday and my aunt is worried. I advised him to get flu shots before leaving Manila. I caught flu & cough on my September trip to HK last year, maybe due to fatigue and when you are in a plane, you get ""recycled"" air. I was ill for more than a week. I had a flu shot in October before my US trip. I caught flu here in Manila last December but it only lasted for 2 days. Even with the 8C weather when we were in HK in January, I did not catch even a cold. So for anyone going to HK since it's flu season there, I highly recommend having a flu shot before going. Not just because of the flu season there but also because you are traveling. "
"Good advice, 3cia. Last week, my daughters and I went to see our family doctor and got the flu shot. My husband had gotten it through work last November. We're all set to go. Leaving later tonight for HKG. After all the planning, we are finally set to go!"
"3cia, if your 'flu' only lasted for 2 days then it wasnt the flu, it was a cold virus. Flu lasts for well over a week, maybe 10 days minimum and you simply do not recover from it that quickly."
"Lots of people do not know the difference between a flu and a cold. Lots of people also do not know that anti-biotic is ineffective against virus, and for that matter, the difference between virus and bacteria."
" That's the advantage of having flu shots. If you get struck with flu, the days when you have it is shorter. If you got it. Same with vaccinations for mumps.  Well, maybe I did not have it but it sure felt like I have the flu. Hope not to start a catfight here hahaha Regardless, I'm glad I had a flu shot last year. It's good for a year so I'm getting another one in October. With or without a flu outbreak, I recommend getting shots if you travel on a regular basis and taking long haul flights. Take vit c tablets too. When I was single, after a long night partying, I take 3,000mg before sleeping and I feel better waking up the next day. Richmond, I just take Kirkland brand, the one bought from Costco :)"
"""So for anyone going to HK since it's flu season there, I highly recommend having a flu shot before going""It's worth being aware that it takes around two weeks for the flu vaccine to become effective."
"RTHK News 2008-03-18 HKT 21:11A traveller who returned from Indonesia has been infected with Chikungunya Fever. The 65-year-old man came back on the 3rd of this month, and was admitted to hospital two days later, after developing fever, chill, rigor, and joint pain.

"5678 is right when he says:""But nothing beats all of the above than the on-going seasonal HK Flu... thanks to unnecessary mass hysteria and scaremongering.""I must first say after my ""challenge"" to 5678, he provided the reference to the webpage and I found the W.H.O. section he was referring to and certainly I understand what 5678 was saying. The W.H.O. does historically refer to avian flu as being related to bird poop exposure but the one section 5678 pointed out from a 2006 article which was extensively peer reviewed seemed to at least not expressly link poop and avian flu, and was much more general in suggesting human illness relative to exposure to sick and diseased birds or their poop. So my apologies to 5678. But back to seasonal HK Flu, if you all want to be really up-to-date on the latest outbreaks wherever you are travelling, see the W.H.O. Disease Outbreak News page and you can reference outbreaks by year, country, or disease!http://www.who.int/csr/don/en/What is notable is no headlines at the W.H.O. for the latest round of seasonal flu in China.As 5678 points out, unnecessary mass hysteria and scaremongering. "
Can anyone tell me the update. Is the flu abating or is everyone still walking around with masks on?
"The flu virus found in the two children who died in the past month belonged to a common strain that showed no mutation, the controller of the Centre for Health Protection said yesterday.Thomas Tsang Ho-fai made the disclosure as he warned the flu peak season would not be over when the Easter holiday ends and primary schools and kindergartens reopen.""We conducted genetic research on the flu virus found in the bodies of the two deceased children over the past few days,"" he said. ""The report showed that the two flu viruses were exactly the same as those widely circulating in our community.""Tsang added that the flu currently circulating in Hong Kong is of the same strain as one found in Australia, Europe and the United States.www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp…======please read important points- HK FLU IS A COMMON STRAIN- NO MUTATION- HK FLU IS THE SAME STRAIN AS IN AUSTRALIA, EUROPE AND U.S.A.you have it, they have it, we have it... so what makes hk flu different from the rest that makes people panic and shudder with fear?"
"in addition....HK StandardNo cause for flu panic: scientistFriday, March 14, 2008A top Hong Kong scientist said yesterday there is no evidence to suggest the flu virus in the territory's current outbreak is more virulent than past flu viruses, insisting there was no immediate danger of a major flu outbreak.POINTS Again- NO CAUSE FOR FLU PANIC- NO IMMEDIATE DANGER OF A MAJOR FLU OUTBREAK- THIS CAME FROM A TOP HK SCIENTIST "
"I just got back from HK, I was there while the 3 children died. That was very unfortunate, but it didn't worry me there . I am from Vancouver and one guy in my office got the flu and everyone ended up getting it before I made the trip. So it was a lot easier for kids in school to catch something from another kid. One big difference for me is at home I drive, so not much getting coughed on on buses, subway, being in small crowded area and meeting all different people than when I was in HK and took public transit everyday. And we live in small world these days, if something really horrible broke out in one corner on this planet, it wouldn't take much to get to everyone else. "
I cant believe how people are panicking about this! Stay home if you are that scared but watch out for your next door neighbour because they may have it too!
