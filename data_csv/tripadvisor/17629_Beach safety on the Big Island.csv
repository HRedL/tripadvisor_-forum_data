Any information about safety in the beach areas would be appreciated. We plan to drive to many beaches on BI while we are there in December. Is it safe to leave stuff in your car at beach areas?
"In general, you donʻt want to leave anything visible in the car or anything valuable in the trunk. And donʻt pull into parking and then put stuff in the trunk, if you must. Breakins are not epidemic, but they do happen."
"Thanks pzp, another question. I was reading about the various hiking trails on the island. Places like Papakolea beach, the write up said that it is a 2.5 mile hike from where you park the car and that it is one of the most remote places on the island. Is it ok to hike to a place like that just on our own or one should always go with a bigger party?"
"The problem with the hike to Papakolea is that the car rental companies forbid you to drive the road down to Ka Lae, where the hike starts. You will void your contract, and if you have any problems youʻll be on your own. Ka Lae also has a bad reputation for car break-ins. Frankly, Papakolea is not that big a deal. Itʻs pretty, but the sand is not bright green, more a vague chartreuse. Itʻs a long, hot, dry hike there and back, and I swear the wind was in our faces going both directions. :-)"
"There are beaches where there is essentially zero theft, mostly the beaches within resort areas, like Kikaua, Kukio, Makaiwa, Honokaope, Pauoa, Kauna'oa. Then there are beaches where you would probably not want to leave anything of value in your car . Hapuna, Waialea, Manini'owali, any east side or Kailua Kona beach. The road to Ka Lae, where the trail to Papakolea starts, is not only prohibited by rental car agencies, but the primary reason is because of the theft ring that sprung up, whereby people in trucks are on hand at the parking area to offer you rides while their buddies stay behind to break into your car.Edited: 3 years ago "
"Sorry to hijack your question laviniam but along the same line, is it ok to leave beach towels, extra clothes, etc. on the beach unattended while we snorkel nearby? I bought a small waterproof box to carry things like phone/keys/money with me while in the water. Thanks!"
"Yes. In almost 20 years here I can't recall any issues with theft of anything on any beach (and I'll admit I leave all sorts of stuff on the beach most people wouldn't ) except once, at La'aloa on Kailua Kona, where somebody stole my beach bag a long time ago. But La'aloa is a real exception, it's not a beach I ever recommend anyway."
"I've never had anything stolen on the beach. Be discreet, and look at the people around you. Very seldom do nice people on vacation, if ever, decide to just pilfer. The people who steal are thieves and mostly do drugs and look sketchy. They aren't the ones hanging out on the sand with you. More likely they are staking out the parking lot. Hapuna is somewhat of an exception in Kohala. Lots of people on the beach. Spencer I do not trust because of the camping, but I don't go there. On the Kailua Kona beaches, no trust."
