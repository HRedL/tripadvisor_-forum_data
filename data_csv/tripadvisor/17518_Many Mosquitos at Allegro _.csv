"They love to eat my GF.. i mean they really really love her. We stayed at the Occidental for 5 days last year and she came home with 60 bites.and she bathed in Deet. [I had 2 I think with no Deet...lol ]Anyways, are they bad like that at the Allegro ?"
"We have stayed at the Allegro in December and July this year. I am also a mosquito magnet (unlike my husband and children). I came home with many bites in December because I was not as prepared (although I did purchase spray in Cozumel). I brought spray with me in July and religiously sprayed even though the other 33 people with us were not getting bit, but I still ended up leaving with a few souvenir mosquito bites.   Long story short, bring the Deet and have her use it right before sundown. If you plan to see the ruins, have her arm herself with EVERYTHING. The jungle mosquitos literally bit me through my denim shorts in December.   You guys have a GREAT time!   BTW - even with all the bites, it does not stop my love for Cozumel.  "
"The mosquitos at allegro are pretty bad. My girlfriend both bathed in deet and we still got about 40-60 mosquito ""kisses"" a piece. We just gave up on the the last two days. For precautionary reasons, bring your own anti-itch cream. The mexican one that everyone recommends does not work. I did here to take garlic pills a few days before you go and while you are there. Good luck."
"The trick is...people buy sprays and lotions that say....""made with deet"" on the lable.....this is Not good enough....Off came out with a spray thet is 100% Deet....We used it a couple of weeks ago and it worked Great....Everyone else stayed inside....Another tip....BUY BEFORE YOU GO......I saw cans of the regular Off selling between 6 to $7.00....YEEEEEOWCH ! That stings more than the Skeeters...."
"Start taking the garlic pills now. Spray , spray, spray, and take some Benadryl tablets and Benadryl gel (it works great). I have also heard that vitamin B complex can be a great repellant as well."
"Hmmm... My wife and I were there back in April and had none if any... I guess you have forced my hand, now I will have to go back to Coz just to investigate this further.. hehe... Is 6 months too early to start a countdown?"
Not at all.....seems like everyone's looking at April :o)
"We just got back from the Allegro and 5 out of the 7 of us were covered in bites and scratching like crazy.We all used Deet, but it didn't seem to make a difference.I was fine, but my hubby is covered with bites from head to toe."
"I second that - I brought the actual Deet with me in July, not the Off with Deet and still got bit. I have never tried the garlic pills. I eat a lot of garlic, but I will definately start taking the pills. I live in Houston and mosquitos are bad here too.Mosquitos or not it will still never stop me from watching the sun go down in Cozumel. :-)"
"I don't know if it had anything to do with the brand or not, but the first night in Coz we were swarmed with mosquitos at sundown. Everytime we swatted our legs we were getting 5 to 10 at a time....The second night we used the off with the 100% deet and didn't get a bite for the rest of the stay......If you go on Google and search ""Off 100% deet"" there is a couple of sites that list the Off products....There are 4 sprays that have a lessor percentage of deet in them.....The one we used only comes in a very small pump bottle....You only need a couple of sprays, then rub it all over....a little goes a long way....I've already have two bottles to take back with me in April....The stuff worked great....Give it a try..."
"Folks, it is not just using 100% deet, it is all the other stuff you apply in the morning and during the day that draws insects. Since I have asthma pretty bad, I am very careful about buying EVERYTHING unscented; including deoderant, hair spray, face cream and no cologne or perfume Idarn and some I really like). The other day, I was standing outside an ice cream stand in Michigan and one lady had biting flies attacking her arms and legs all over. I had nothing. I even bathe in unscented body lotion. The smells you put on during and after your morning shower may just be what is attracting the little buggers. Start with a clean slate (unscented body) and then apply the deet before you go out. "
"I agree with both Morgy and MichiganOldLady... lived in the backwoods of boonyland growing up and worked in forestry here in PEI, and the more scent you have one other than deet, the nastier the lil critturs can be. Some folks used to swear by using a fabric softener sheet like Bounce to keep them away, but I think it would look a little odd to have one of those hanging from yer shorts... I always try to be positive about things, so I am thinking, if lots of folks are there ahead of me, maybe the mozzies will all be full by the time I get there! ; )Regardless, if they are there or not, I can't wait to get back to Coz..."
"Okay, I will bite (whoops did not really mean THAT way). Where is PEI Canada? I am hoping the same thing for November that the darn buggers will be both full, tired of flying and will just leave me be. But I agree with being careful about scents and no frou frou sprays. Just go for the heavy duty deet stuff. "
"lol... Where is PEI? What? The entire world doesn't know!?! Yeah, well... there isn't much to it. It is the smallest province in Canada, on the east coast. It is a small island surrounded by beautiful beaches and has what seems like a million golf courses on it. We seem to be known for our spuds, our golf, our beaches, Anne of Green Gables and COWS ice-cream... Anyway, can't wait to get back to the Allegro. Taking the kids this time, should be fun. Feed the bugs well for us in November, ok? : )"
So what's the trick if you need both Deet and sunscreen? Put on sunscreen and then the spray? Or do the mosquitos only come out at night? We will be at Coz Palace in November and I am trying to get my shopping list together now. 
The SWARM comes out at sundown....They usually don't bother during the day....unless you are walking through the woods...
"Well, let's hope I don't find myself in the woods! I am planning on seeing lots of water instead!"
Then all you have to worry about is dinner time....The little monsters start at the ankles....then get into a feeding frenzy...... 
"Hello,Just got back from Allegro this morning, and YES bring your bug spray for sure. You will use it i promisehave fun:)"
"I recently returned from the Allegro (one of the Flopnfly group) and had quite a few mosquito bites. My daughter had way more than I.I used 50% Deet diligently and also don't use scented products, but unfortunately, I am and always have been a mosquito magnet. I just accept the fact that I'm going to come home with bites. I didn't have as many this trip as I had in Guardalavaca (Cuba) in June. That was probably the most bites I've ever had in my life. Actually made me feel sick bleh"
"mojitomiss and other ladies, Mosquito bites and a lot of insect bites can make you very ill. I can recall my hands and arms swelling to twice their size from a gnat bite. As you said....some people have all the luck and are magnets. For the most part unscented lotions, and toiletries do help. But from what Morgy says, it is not good in the evening. I will get the 100% deet stuff from Outdoor World in Michigan. I don't want to coop myself up in the evening all the time, but neither do I want to be ill or get what Robert had. I guess it is just a bad year for some reason and there are lots of bugs. Some times there is no explanation. I also use an unscented hair spray or none at all. It may be a good idea for ladies to shake out their hair or brush it when they come in at evening time. Mosquitos seem to love to hide in hair and on clothes too to attack later when they don't have to fight all of their friends for a piece of your body. "
"....also, you may want to read this artical posted by TravelJudy on another thread........Then use the 100% Deet.... :o)Copy and Paste... …yahoo.com/s/…dengue_epidemic"
 I noticed the mosquiotos only arrived after sunset. I think I would bring a citronelle candle with me. They seem to work really well.
"Just got back on Sat. Had the heavy duty deet, tried bounce sheets, worn long pants, had specialt anklebands that are ment to stop the bugs. Kept our feet up off the floor, tried to sit where there was a breeze.Took the vitamin B weeks before we cameNo good. Think hubby and I each got about 20 - 30 per day/knight. Not sure I could have done a second week, it was driving us both over the edge.On a happy note, some people only got a few.Best of luck. Take antihistamines, they really help.Halina"
"I started the (unscented!) garlic pills yesterday in preparation for leaving on Sunday. I've never tried this before but, It's open season for the mozzies when they see me. And I tend to swell like mad from some bites, not sure if it is the mozzies or something else (sand fleas?) I get bitten during the day by things even when I'm not on the beach. Sweet English blood, I suppose.I'll let you all know if it works at all. Like MOL I don't use scented stuff while I'm in Coz. I'm also taking a bucket of deet wipes, sprays and other concoctions, some natural, some chemical. So, we shall see.....bbbbzzzzzzzzzzz, bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. "
"Boy, they will see all of us coming....ankle bands, smelly deet and a candle to light our way. Hey, packing a candle or two is a darn good idea. I will do a search and destroy this evening to see what is left in the stores or in my utility room. I forgot all about the garlic pills. I heard that helps with black flies. Didn't know it would help with the mosquitos. I will try that. I will tell hubby it is another vitamin.I am curious however in the basic cause of the mosquito problem all over the carribean. "
".....and you the locals are chuckling among themselves saying....Yep, The Gringos Are here... :o)"
"MOL, that's exactly what I would have told hubby too but I just handed him the capsules when we were having dinner, and he swallowed them, just like that. I may have mentioned something about ""don't come crying to me when..."" and ""buy your own deet then..."" Whatever, it worked and, at least if the shop assistant was wrong and the garlic pills do give off an odour, we won't be able to smell each other, we'll have tables to ourselves, the shuttle bus will clear out, and so on.....Now, all I have to do is find something to clear away the roaches from the island while I'm there, and the tarantulas. The exposure therapy I'm putting myself through is not working fast enough!!"
"Morgy and BeCoz, That's okay I don't mind being the crazy gringo lady with red hair. But I called Outdoor World and they still have the repellant with 100% deet. It is called 100 Repel.I will try the garlic pills too. Hey, I will NOT be bothered by vampires wherever I go. And don't a lot of Mexican dishes use garlic? Who will know?I will put a flower in my hair and every now and then say something like ""Who would have thought they smelled like garlic?"" Damn orchids! Seriously, I did tell sweetie poo to not reserve a dinner on the beach for my birthday. It will be a toss up between La Veranda or just staying at the hotel and eating. I will probably be all pooped from celebrating all day from the east side beaches anyway. "
....and while you are wearing the flower in your hair....don't even give one thought about the killer bees....Heh...heh... :o)
"Thanks a bunch Morgy. You should have seen the stuff I collected at Outdoor World (you guys would just love this place). I have two small spray bottles of 100 Repel for skin. I have the stuff you spray on clothing and shoes and tents that last for up to 6 weeks ( I will do that before I leave) and I have the wrist bands. Not really glamourful, but who cares. I also bought a nice big carryall canvas bag for piling in a towel or two snorkel gear and bug spray and my sea safe for going to the beaches. I have a long weekend coming up and I will get the garlic pills. I am ready. The antihistamines are always in my purse anyway. So if you see a swarm of the little buggers heading for Florida, just duck. They will be avoiding me at all costs. I guess Robert did us a big favor in just letting us know what could happen. It made all of us more aware of the problem, uncovered some news that it is not just Cozumel but all through the Carribean.Outdoor World is part of Bass Pro Shops and you can order the stuff on line if they have cleared it out of the northern drug stores. I am looking on it as part of a first aid kit. "
 Yup...........there are mossies....they spray helps a bit bring deet..also worse than mossies...sand fleas...on overcast days they are out on the beach. Also we left beach area around 4ish during the day for the pool. If your on the beach and its cloudy at that time rinse feet well when leaving the sand ..we dipped them in the jaccuzi. Didn't walk on beach at night...saw what bites they left on friends.. L
Geez MOL....anything else and you are going to have to wear one of those Hazardous Waste Stickers...Heh...Heh....You can also order the Off 100% deet online....Google Off 100% Deet...
"Morgy, Some folks may say that I am hazardous waste. You are good people and I learned what the darn smiley means after several months. So, if you see that in the future, it is my little hello to you. (o: (o: (o: (o: (o:"
