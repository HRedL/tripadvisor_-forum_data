"There has not been a lot of good news lately. But with the discharge of Boris Johnson from hospital on Sunday, and statements that the “peak” strain on the National Health Service would be over the Easter period, you might be under the impression that the storm is passing, and the Covid-19 pandemic will soon be a memory.Fueling this mood are reports from studies of communities already hit by the pandemic. At long last we are beginning to see the results of work looking for signs that people have already been infected, through the presence of antibodies against Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19. Some of this data suggests strongly that many infections may have passed unnoticed, with the only symptoms being mild things such as loss of the ability to smell and taste, and that as a result, more people may be immune than had been thought. Surely this is a sign that communities around the world can breathe a sigh of relief and start getting back to work?Unfortunately, it is nothing of the kind.https:/…number-coronavirus-pandemic"
Just because we are descending slowly doesnt mean we can take off our parashute just yet.
"NZ is following a policy of elimination rather than containment but there is a problem with that, the tests are throwing up false positives and negatives plus many people are asymptomatic. Reports show that the virus has mutated at least three times in the world since the outbreak. Relying on big Pharma to produce an effective vaccine maybe wishful thinking.The numbers being released ( based on very limited testing) by various countries are either a commentary on their own honesty or on their ability to be honest"
"I do wear gloves when supermarket shopping (mostly as I also shop for others) but take off the gloves after I deliver the groceries to friends but before I unpack at home. I don't wear a mask and won't unless it is mandatoryI walk my dog each day - the regulars have a system which seems to work fine for us all. If you arrive in the park and no one else is there, you can let your dog off for a run and ball play. If another dog turns up, you then leash your dog and allow the new dog to play off lead."
"""you might be under the impression that the storm is passing, and the Covid-19 pandemic will soon be a memory.""No one is thinking this, not even in the slightest, bit of a nonsense commentary really.The UK just acknowledged they're no where near any peak, or light at the end of the tunnel, and just extended their lock down by another 3 weeks.The only one beating the drum for re-opening the economy in the US is the Translucent Orange Moron and his GOP capitalists.Poster child for the early response Singapore is going through a massive resurgence in case numbers and Japan has just declared a State of Emergency.Russia is escalating rapidly with 15%+ day on day increases in cases.Yes Italy and Spain are starting to reopen some businesses but is more an acknowledgement that they can only contain the virus and limit spread at best, and staying locked down further is no longer going to achieve anything, elimination is a pipe dream.New Zealand is a different scenario, an isolated Island nation that closed its borders and enforced a lock down as elimination was a real possibility with all cases being imported. Numbers of new cases are dropping, especially now as New Zealand is almost at the end of 2 cycles and almost all cases can now be linked to a point of origin. Encouraging is the random testing now happening to see if there is any undetected community spread, and have no doubt this will continue, even if new cases reaches 0. As long as those in the Health Sector are caring for hospitalised COVID patients there will always be a risk of infection and new 'clusters', as is still being seen with a Wellington DHB Nurse becoming infected.Elimination is a strong possibility, but won't be for another 2-3 months when the last known case recovers. It is then just a case of keeping the border closed until a vaccine is created, so 1-2 years away."
"I don't think the New Zealand economy will allow for their borders to be closed for 1-2 years.Just today on our local TV their was talk of NZ down the track open it's borders to Australia as both are island countries with similar situations.This maybe a start I would think but quite a few months down the track yet.PS love your comments BarryEdited: 11:25 pm, April 16, 2020 "
"Our foreign minister, Winston Peters, was suggesting this could be a first step once both countries get the virus under control. Australia is still our main source of overseas visitors, and Australia is every Kiwis stepping stone to the world, where we all cut our teeth. I can't wait, I'll be on the first flight."
Wen to the UK and the US and travelled the world for many years before I got to Oz. I don't think I know anyone who went to Oz first.
I would have thought New Zealanders would travel through OZ to get to Europe as it would be too far to fly all the way to EuropeI know of many who used Emerites flights that went NZ to Australia to Dubai and onto Europe and vice versa.I am wondering how WLnz flew to Europe without going through Australia first.Maybe I have it all wrong correct me please it I have this wrong
"gts While my first 2 overseas trips where to Aus. the rest (west bound) over flew that red (from the air) place to Bali, Singapore, KL, Bangkok and Hong Kong apart from a couple on Emerites. From memory Garuda, Singapore, Malaysian, Thai and Air NZ."
"I always flew via LAX. I know it has a bad rep now, but it used to be fine 40 years ago. And then even when US border security/homeland security went bad, by then I had my greencard so each time I entered the US I was greeted with 'welcome home'.Anyway, even if I had flown via Oz, I don't count fuel stops as visiting a country."
"Just seeing Sydney Harbour , the Bridge and the Opera House when flying in is enough for many to say they have seen at least some of Sydney."
There's more GTS?**hides**
Not sure what you are asking Andy. More of what?.
"Sydney, I assume."
"More to Sydney than the Harbour, Bridge and Opera House GTS. I first went to Australia in '87 when I worked very briefly in Adelaide. Leaving Sydney for Adelaide I took a photo through a gap in the clouds of the city below and it was only when I had the photos developed that I saw it was a perfect picture of the Sydney Harbour Bridge - I had no idea what was in the shot when I took it."
"For the avoidance of doubt, in case that gets lost in translation, I was not being serious about Sydney. I have said previously how our time in NZ was made even better by being bookended by Singapore and Sydney, and we would have loved to have had more time everywhere."
"""I would have thought New Zealanders would travel through OZ to get to Europe ""?? Sorry GTS, no Kiwi has ever flown to Europe via Australia, makes absolutely no sense at all as it gets you no where near Europe, from NZ is close to 24 hours away. Kiwis get to Europe via 3 main routes, Asia (Singapore) , North America (LA) or the Middle East (Doha or Dubai), all transits that get you close to 1/2 way to Europe or even closer with the likes of the Middle East.As for Oz being the first destination, can't think of any friends or family when this was the case, most cut their teeth in the South Pacific, Fiji, Cook Islands, Noumea, Vanuatu, Tahiti or Hawaii. For me it was Hawaii almost 30 years ago, then Bali.Problem with Oz is that culturally it's too similar to NZ, so doesn't provide that real sense of being somewhere else, also Bali and Thailand are attractive for easy to get to, being very cheap for food and accommodation, and BEER!Oz has always been more of a safe destination for the conservative traveler.Don't get me wrong, I've been to Oz many times for work and have a soft spot for Melbourne."
"Add to the 1/2 point is China (2nd biggest source of visitor and our biggest trading partner) For a long time Hong Kong was one of the choices.Way back in the seventies on our first trip to Europe LAX, Singapore and Hong Kong were basically the only options. On the cheapest ticket you could have a 2 night stop over.The only choices of airline we had in 1978 were Air NZ, UTA, Pan AM, TWA and British Airways using the Air NZ plane from LA.Over the years we have been via LAX a couple of times, Singapore and Hong Kong. The last 3 times we went via Guangzhou as we could afford business class with China Southern which allowed us to go from Christchurch. We had planned to try Seoul this year but decided to give it a miss just before this Covid.Edited: 5:49 pm, April 17, 2020 "
