https:/…I hope it is good news for us.
I would be surprised if they made any change to our status. Our numbers are slightly up and they have more cases recently.
"I don't see any difference to the situation in the UK and others in Category A.For example Germany has 11,000 confirmed cases in the last 14 days and so does the ukhttps://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-d…"
"Poland also have an increase in positive tests, especially in the past week. Another Cat A country. Five passengers travelling on two flights from Poland tested positive during random testing at the airport yesterday. However, more likely countries will be moved to Cat B rather than move the UK to Cat A."
The only positive outcome will be to protect Cyprus so I agree that the likely outcome for UK will be stay the same and if any changes are made it will be downgrades rather than upgrades
"Due to fly to Paphos in 3 weeks, hopefully by then we will be in Cat A. It is nowhere near as bad now as it was a month ago, just hopefully it can stay like this for the next few weeks."
Maybe its a case that upgrades happen on the 1st of the month and downgrades can happen at anytime.
"We are due to fly to cyprus 9th September, we booked flights and accommodation ourselves not a package holiday We said that if we are not in catory A before we fly we won't be going and just loose our flight money We fly on a Wednesday so need to have covid19 test done 72hrs before that means we would have to have the test done Sunday and no one's open in our area on Sunday's can't leave it till money as might not get results in time ,"
"Do you mean private clinics aren't open on Sundays or the NHS ones, I'm sure an NHS one will open day within a 30 minute drive somewhere, have a look at the gov.uk website and do a dummy booking to see what is available next Sunday."
Several NHS test centers are open on a Sunday
