Go to Prairiedogbrewing.ca and read the following article: SIX FRUSTRATING CHALLENGES TO REOPENING A RESTAURANT IN THE COVID-19 ERA. Very well written and informative.
We have heard of a few places being closed for not following the new regulations. Being checked to see if food orders tickets are real by checking the bill receipts. Can’t have liquor without food.
"Ah the ""nanny state"" is enjoying a real ""hayday"". A whole industry has been born. Buy stock in anything health/sanitation/pharma/PPE related. Whoever thought hat you could get so rich selling masks and wet wipes? On the other hand - liqour laws (at least in Denver) went out the window. Booze delivered to your front door with your Kung Pao. Who 'da thunk it?Edited: 11:14 am, May 24, 2020 "
The article was very well written. It explains clearly the challenges a restaurant business faces with the large overhead and now the ever changing safety procedures required to hopefully make a small profit. Prairiedogbrewing.ca
"Good for them if they feel that not opening is the correct decision for them. Their decision seems well thought out and I support them 100%. At the same time, I also support those small businesses who have decided to reopen. The wonderful thing about the free market system is that each business can make their own choice and the consumer will let them know if it was correct.Cheers all."
"Well John L., this is not just an economic question. People and businesses do need to be responsible. It does no good if one restaurant does not open and then another one opens and people get infected. Not sure you have thought this thing through. Its a bit more complicated."
"""It does no good if one restaurant does not open and then another one opens and people get infected""This may be true but we do now have a government promise of June 1 being a new phase. We have to balance the damage from the virus versus the catastrophic economic damage. We can't just close down businesses forever. For better or worse, things are going to change in about1 week.Edited: 10:09 pm, May 24, 2020 "
I certainly agree with you yandoblu. We have to open but according to guidelines. I was responding to what I thought was a statement that owners could open simply because they want to. W/O any mention of opening safely. He was talking free market system. I agree with you.
"Gopkrs, I took some extra time to think before I responded to you since you assume that I don't think enough. That you would assume... as you did, that I support any business reopening without safety precautions is absolutely absurd. Nothing that I wrote indicates that I felt that way."
All right. Thanx for the clarification.
“We have to balance the damage from the virus versus the catastrophe economic damage.”I agree with this statement 100%. Well said!
