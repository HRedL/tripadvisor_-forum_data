"Can someone give me any insights on the Pueblo Bonito Los Cabos? We have a great opportunity but I’d like to make sure it’s a nice hotel and wouldn’t want to compromise just for a good deal.We went to Cabo in 2009 and loved it. It’s one of the very few places I’d visit more than once (and we went in the midst of the swine flu epidemic!). We stayed at the ME and had so much fun. It was perfect location, setting, etc. I’d love to stay there again but we can save a lot of money by staying at the PB. Any info would be very much appreciated (Location? A lot of children? Food? How’s the pool? Service?) This is our first trip since 2009 (and probably our last for a while) so I just want to make sure it’s perfect. Thank you!"
Location...next door to MEKids...not manypool service...great!Food....Very good.I love PBLC....aka Blanco.....and so will you!
"Can't tell you much about PB but we also stayed at ME Cabo during the Swine Flu epidemic in 2009 it was so perfect, no cruise ship blocking our view lol. Enjoy your trip :)"
"It is one of our favorite resorts in Cabo. It is an older hotel but beautifully maintained and is located right next door to the ME so an easy walk into town and right in the center of Medano Beach.It is smaller than most of the other beach resorts and almost every room had a gorgeous view. The pool is small but we love it! It has an island in the middle so you can walk ""laps"" around it while enjoying a beverage- perfect! There is a very good restaurant onsite, Cilantros if you don't feel like leaving one night."
