"Gov extended lockdown today until May 15.There are no new cases, but they are still having problems with illegal entry and there are too many cases in neighboring islands for them to let their guard down.I am sorry for those who were planning a trip at this time."
But really great to hear there are no new cases!
agreed! We were supposed to be arriving in a month... so sad for our own plans but hopeful this means a smoother return to tourism/economy.
"We're on-island right now!! (In our heads, that is!)(sob!)"
This is for AXA? What about SXM? We are scheduled to arrive June 13th. Praying that we can go.
"I read that wrong, it is May 12 for AXA.French side of SXM is locked down until May 11, I am unsure about the Dutch side, which is where the airport is located. There have been discussions about the airport closing for 2 or 6 months, there has been no announcement as to that."
For sure SXM is going to be locked down for a long time! They are basically out of money to repair the airport.
Can you link to the airport closing for 2-6 months? The only item I am aware of was an article in the Daily Herald from a few weeks ago if I recall.Our honeymoon trip in July is still.... up in the air.... no pun intended.
"Kristen...so in 7 weeks or so you think it's a reality?Stay well...stay informed...I've said it before and I'll say it again..Be Smart......Be Sensible..........Be Realistic.I for one, will not be going on a plane.....anywhere......nor will I be going anywhere where there are crowds UNTIL they come up with a proven vaccine against COVID19. My days of playing Russian Roulette have long passed....Sorry..... but if people disagree you are putting not only yourself in harms way......but many others. Regardless of the severe economic hardship for the lovely people of Anguilla, I choose their safety before anything else.Peace.....out.Edited: 2:48 pm, April 17, 2020 "
It’s a heavy heart and tears we canceled our May trip. Seeing the St.Martain airport closed thru at least the end of May we had to do this.....12 years and now will have to wait until next year.....love My friends in Anguilla!
"From the latest news it looks like AXA is one of the safest places to be at this time.They have (cautiously) discovered that the virus does not like sun, heat and humidity, which might be the reason that hot climates fare better than cold, dry ones and have less problems.More study is required but it looks like a possible new beginning on the horizon.Fingers crossed...."
"PS. Problem is that plane travel might cause a big problem that has to be addressed with the dry, dark, closed air-conditioned atmosphere inside the cabin."
Well... if you have antibodies and they actually turn out to be protective and that you can't spread it... that might be the only scenario were I would consider getting on a plane.That is if you can even get a test.
Time is our biggest factor.
"Fauci has said that he expects this virus to act like other flu viruses in that it will go down in the summer and return in the fall. Which goes to what Pepper said that the virus does not like sun and heat. NY is a cold damp, dreary place this time of year.Edited: 5:33 pm, April 18, 2020 "
"Dominican Republic has over 4000 cases with nearly 400 deaths. Here is a chart showing Caribbean cases:https:/…So, it would seem as if the warm weather theory is not accurate. Anguilla's numbers are staying low because they closed their borders and stopped all boats. A few days ago they arrested two people for trying to smuggle in illegals."
Any possibility of Anguilla opening up entry by June 1st?
"Well, personally I am inclined to believe that hot weather theory. But I guess time will tell."
"I hope its correct. It would be nice to keep Anguilla Corona free with open borders. I would like nothing better than to see its residents safe, and their economy thriving. As it stands now, the only way they can stay safe is to continue their lock down. SXM just extended their lock down, and there is no travel right now between Canada and the US. It is going to be a while before things get back to ""normal""."
I am a health care professional. Covid-19 appears to be affected by the heat in a similar way to the Influenza virus.At our hospital we are gearing up and expecting a fall resurgence of Covid-19.
"The current numbers out of the Caribbean are frightening. Please do not let your guard down just because summer is coming. Be diligent, stay home, stay safe, be well."
"Agree @ Ellen. California,Texas and Florida are warmer climates and their numbers are in the top 10 cases in US. So while I wish the warmer temps affected the virus, trust me I do since we just cancelled our June 26th trip... I don’t honestly think anyone truly knows. Be safe all!"
Nothing like the amount of cases that are in NY.
"NYC has a high concentration of people living close together and using public transportation. California, Florida and Texas are more spread out and don't have the same subway, commuter rail and bus usage as NYC.The lockdown ends May 12 but the borders will probably be closed until end of May (or later). Sigh. Finally giving in and cancelling my end of May trip."
I will be going by what the experts have said.
Ha! Which experts? A good many of them have been wrong so far.
"""California,Texas and Florida are warmer climates and their numbers are in the top 10 cases""They are 3 of the largest states too, per capita their numbers are miniscule ."
Florida got hit with New York people flying down to escape not only the cold but the virus. Many cases in South Florida.
@tayfor211 I mentioned those three states having high numbers because I was mentioning that despite the warmer weather they still had high cases and that the virus didn’t seem to be losing strength since it was mentioned in a previous post about it dying off in hot weather and that New York’s was high due to cold gloomy weather (in one post)
"Let's not forget how many people live in Los Angeles, Miami and the big cities of Texas."
"Dominican Republic's population is 10 million, there are 4000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and over 400 deaths. DR is warm and humid year 'round."
Or where you live Ellen. I also have family who live in Vegas.
"Vacay 567, not sure what you mean. We have around 3 million population, 3000 cases and 300 deaths.We have been on total lockdown since March 16, all non essential businesses are closed, including liquor stores and gyms.We are to stay home, and if we go out to stay 6' away from people and wear a mask.I, personally, have not seen anyone or been anywhere since March 8, it is a trying time, but we will get through it. We need patience, kindness and to understand that what we are doing is for the greater good."
"Man o' man, when I read back my posts on this thread, how my mind has done a 360*.Looks like heat is the Covid's friend.I have hopes that the AXA government is smart enough not to allow outside guests to infiltrate their (so far) safe community.As difficult as it must be for the restaurants, hotels, businesses, etc. the health of the island must come first if they are to survive.Survive before Thrive!"
