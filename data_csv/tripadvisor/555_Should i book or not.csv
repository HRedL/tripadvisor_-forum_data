"Hi guys I never been on holiday to another country in my life but my partner has when she was a child. Now me and my partner are sending off for our first passports so we can go on holiday to antigua in April 2021,there will be a delay for new passports upto 5 months some reports say, but travel agent says we can pay a deposite for April to secure our date, my partner is of course paying, so since she's paying she don't know what to do she said she wants to pay the £600 deposit now and secure her place but I recommended her to wait until she gets her passport then book but she risks loosing her place the travel advisor said, what about insurance etc, help please"
Place for what? A tour? You don't need to take a tour to Antigua.Personally I wouldn't be putting down a deposit for anything travel related right now. No one knows if you will be able to travel to Antigua in April.
"Place as in secure her date of departure and holiday start as we booked 2 weeks off work and it's only 2 weeks we can get off to go on vacation.so far antigua is back open and BA is flying there.Edited: 9:11 am, July 24, 2020 "
"You don't need an agent, book directly and post on Antigua forum for recommendations. But I think it's still too early to book foreign holidays for next year, wait till the Autumn at least."
"1) Add your location to your profile so we can understand your situation2) Let us know if you understand with Covid going on now that even spring 2021 isn't definite3) Explain to us this ""tour"" thing. Generally for a trip to an island, you book a flight and a hotel."
"Updated my location. Anyways its not a tour, just a 2 week all inclusive holiday at the club st james resort antigua, my partner is just unsure to place deposit down so she knows her April holiday is booked up and pay the rest of it when the passports arrive. But I say wait but she won't have any of it."
"Nathan,A slightly different take from me. The travel agent is likely to suggest that your partner will lose the place if she doesn't book now. If I was a travel agent looking for business I might do something similar. I'm not convinced that the appetite for travel right now is so overwhelming and think it is unlikely to be oversubscribed. Your shout, of course, but they'll be grateful for the £600 for sure."
Make certain everything you book is fully refundable in cash. Booking thru an agent can add a layer that could result in a voucher refund instead of cash. Get it in writing.
"Wonder if the OP is talking about booking a package - hotel and airfare - which would require a deposit? Even if that is the case, I'd be waiting until later this Fall to book anything and would make sure to arrange as many refundable options as possible so that my financial risks were minimal. As others have said, the Covid-19 situation is too uncertain IMO. We aren't booking our usual Caribbean trip for February at this point. Additionally you should keep up with the entry requirements for Antigua, as they can change between now and your planned trip in April due to the ever-changing Covid situation. They can be found at https:/…"
"I said she could lose out of £600 if something were to happen,but she said she's not bothered, the thing is I don't think anyone would provide travel insurance without a valid UK passport correct?"
"Thanks barbp it is a package holiday your right, and Northern the travel agent and BA said on the phone said the package holiday is fully cash refundable if something were to happen, but I have not yet asked about if deposits are refundable."
I would be surprised if that was the case.....after all you are not insuring one single place but general travel over a specific period.
"You don't need a passport to get travel insurance - after all you can buy insurance for holidays in the UK.You should take out travel insurance at the same time as booking, so that you are covered should something happen to you between now and next April. But it's not recommended to buy it from either the travel agent or BA. Have a look at moneysupermarket or another comparison site for suggestions and beware the very cheap offers, which are likely to have poor cover.In this case with no international travel experience using a proper bricks and mortar travel agent combined with a reputable airline like BA is very sensible.Whether you put down a deposit now or later for me depends on how much you want the specific hotel and dates for this holiday. There are any number of hotels like the one you're considering across the Caribbean so there is bound to be plenty available past Christmas if you can be a bit flexible. The only caveat would be if you're planning to go out during the UK schools' Easter holidays when demand will be high or if you really want this specific hotel on specific dates."
"With no end in sight and predictions for a vaccine not being available till next year, I think getting any travel insurance to cover you during this pandemic could be a much greater problem than having your passport. While things may be different in the UK, I don't recall having been asked my passport # when getting my trip insurance independently of a tour or cruise company (who would have that info).Interesting that she would not be bothered by losing 600 GBP. Maybe she says that now, but what about next April if you have to cancel? Many travel-related companies are offering reduced and refundable deposits but you have to read the fine print. Some deposits are only refundable up to the final payment date, and that could still be many months before the actual trip. At that point the normal cancellation penalties may kick in, and those can be substantial. I wouldn't make a decisions based on a phone conversation - I would want the agent to provide me a copy of the T&C's in writing first."
"Cancellation penalties? How much we talking about?, to be honest I wouldn't want to cancel the holiday anyways, I will tell her just wait it out until she gets her passport between November and December-ish and then pay, we got option of paying full or deposite but we will pay a deposite as we don't know what will happen in April with covid 19."
"Don't accept a verbal ""yes it's fully refundable"". Get it in writing."
Thanks for help guys I will try my best to persuade her to wait until autumn/early winter when her passport comes to book
"I would also want to be 100% certain anything I booked was 100% refundable, otherwise I would just wait. I travel at lot usually, and I feel I will be booking way more last minute trips in the future if flying, and if driving the accom will all be pay on arrival. After spending the last 4 months trying to get refunds from all kinds of places, it is just not worth it. Get your passports organised, then look at options. The travel agent just wants the cash. Nowhere is booking up fast right now. If they tell you that, then they are reeling you in with their lies. Go elsewhere, or plan your own trips."
"""Cancellation penalties? How much we talking about?,""Most tours, cruises, and even package holidays will have cancellation penalties. These usually start kicking in after your final payment (but some could be after your deposit is made) , and can be any number of days prior to your departure. For example, you might lose 25% of you money if you cancel between 91-120 days prior to the start ; 50% at 61-90 days, 75% at 31-60 days, and then 100% under 30 days. The time frames and amounts will vary with each travel company, so this is why I am strongly recommending you get everything in writing - don't rely on what you are being told over the phone. Make sure your travel insurance will fully cover any of these type of cancellation fees.You might not want to cancel the holiday, but right now none of us can predict what the state of travel will be next April, so you may not have a choice. Even if Covid-19 is under control, things happen in life that could prevent you from traveling for other reasons."
"Have I missed the name of travel agent that your wishes to pay a deposit with? Is it a non refundable deposit, even though it seems to guarantee you availability at your chosen hotel on your chosen dates.Travel insurance doesn't need a passport, and should always be taken out the moment you may any sort of payment towards a holiday to ensure you are covered and can get monies back. However, not all travel insurances are equal, so you need to do research on travel insurance before taking out a policy to make sure it meets your needs.I'm no expert on travel insurance, but I'm unaware of any new policy that would cover you for Covid as a reason to need to cancel. Also, not having a passport issued or renewed in time is also something few travel insurances will cover - and yes, I've read reports that brand new first issue UK passports are taking an age to be issued at the moment, so backed up are UKPA. Even if you are set on staying in a certain hotel, it's rare for all bookings to a property to be exclusively available with only one travel agent, so you should shop around for agents, if it is a package deal. Some airlines have excellent holiday travel offers that count as packages for ABTA security and only need a small deposit paid to secure the price and hotel dates. It's my personal view that it's a buyers market at the moment for almost all kinds of travel. I suspect - but cannot guarantee - that if you do not book right now, you may find the trip becomes cheaper not more expensive the closer you get to your travel date. And by holding back you may have a bit more certainly of what's happening with the darn virus.SWT"
"If you're looking at BA, you can book packages directly on their site - you don't need an agent and at least then if something goes wrong you can deal directly with BA (who have anecdotally been good about refunds/changes for both holidays and flights booked with them direct). It used to be a £60 deposit and the balance about 8 weeks before travel but that may have changed). I wouldn't listen to any guff about prices, no one knows what will happen next year - if anything with lowish demand likely to continue there'll be sales toward the end of this year. I would not want to book any earlier than this anyway and even then it might be too early to tell where Covid is heading and the fallout on travel.Buy travel insurance separately - check what's covered and isn't and buy it as soon as you can after you decide on your trip and in the meantime apply for your passport(s) which are taking quite a long time to process at the moment."
"""I'm no expert on travel insurance, but I'm unaware of any new policy that would cover you for Covid as a reason to need to cancel. ""Trailfinders has a policy that claims to cover you for changes due to Covid-19. Disclaimer - i haven't looked in detail about what is covered."
"Who is the agent? I don’t see any rush to book this far in advance.If it were me, I’d be booking the holiday directly with BA. I’ve had 3 holidays with them, everything went fine and I saved a lot compared to booking flight and hotels separately."
"The travel agent was haystravel, I am going to book with BA they seemed excellent so far"
"As above, you don't need a passport to book flights or a package holiday, and you do not need a passport to buy travel insurance.The details of what is required in terms of payment, what is refundable, what may be returned in the form of a voucher, and what may be nonrefundable are all available at the BA website. You can make what's called a dummy booking there and go as far as the payment page without having to give anything more than the names Jane Smith and John Jones with made-up details. With that dummy booking you'll get to the page with the terms and conditions of the purchase - this will be a clickable link.BA are usually good about providing the terms in easy to understand language, and it's worth the ten minutes needed to read through them to ensure you know exactly what you're buying. If you have more questions then call BA at 0191 490 7900 between about 0730 and 2000 as the phone agents are usually pretty knowledgeable.What is covered by insurance seems to be contingent to some extent on whether there are advisories against travel to certain countries; if the FCO suggests travellers don't go then it's doubtful any insurer would cover the trip. See what your bank or credit cards can offer for insurance, but if the coverage isn't suitable then keep looking until you find what *you* need. It's also worth the 15 minutes needed to go over the policy to make sure it's what you want even though you hope you'll never have to make a claim."
Hays Travel are going to encourage you partner to book. What agent wouldn't? But I'm one of those who wouldn't want to book anything at the moment for next April. At least not unless I was very sure that I would not lose a lot of money if things happened that meant we wouldn't want to go.
"Just done a dummy booking and read the fine print and this came upGood news. Your holiday is eligible for additional flexibility.Up to 3 weeks before travel, you can change your booking without paying our usual fees (shown below) or you can cancel in exchange for a voucher (for travel before 30 Apr 2022).Then this in tiny writingMore than 3weeks before travel:depositMore than 72hrs before travel: 60%Less than 72hrs before travel: 100%Fees apply to the total package"
Just wait a few months Travel is so uncertain at present especially for long haul destinations. With the Covid worries I believe there will be plenty of people not travelling for a while & you will get availability to your hotel of choice in a few months. I agree with the above also book direct with BA
I don't see a lot of point in rushing into anything at the moment.
"The St. James has 280 rooms, so it's highly likely that with the reduced demand you will still be able to get a room in a few months. You might want to keep abreast of the Covid-19 information the resort has posted on their website, including the current requirement to have a negative Covid-19 test within 7 days of arrival. Of course all of this can change significantly between now and April.https:/…"
"Just no point in rushing in to a trip booking, months away, right now. Book time off, get passports in order, and see how things look much closer to the date. Oh, and save up, savings are everyone's best friend when you like to travel."
