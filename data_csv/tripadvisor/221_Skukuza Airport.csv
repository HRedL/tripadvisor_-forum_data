"Skukuza airport may have opened, but I don't know if any carrier is flying there yet.Airlink reckon they cannot resume flights before November, so there may only be charter flights, like Bateleur air charters, or Federal Air, flying to the KNP area.Besides, in game reserves,visitors can only self drive, and no overnight stays are allowed at the moment.Our borders are also still closed to international ""leisure "" visitors."
"QOD1 - just saw that the private lodges in KZN can open early next week. 8 July! Just no crossing provincial borders yet so it will only be locals. But it’s a good start and test to see how it goes. And seeing pictures from fb friends in the kzn parks from today was oddly exciting! Unfortunately Americans won’t be welcome any time soon. We went through so much in New York and few learned from our experience. Hopefully I’ll get to visit in 2022 (with residency by then!). Holding thumbs. It will be interesting to see which airlines pick up which routes, especially those tourist routes, over the next year+."
"I hope it works like a trial run. It can’t be profitable, especially with some of the very good specials. But many of them have continued to house (and maybe even pay) some of their staff. Let’s hope it is just the beginning. There are more residents in KZN than in Limpopo or Mpumalanga (I believe but likely wrong) who might have the opportunity."
