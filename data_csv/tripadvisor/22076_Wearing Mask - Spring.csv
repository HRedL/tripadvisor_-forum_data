"I was watching a video on touring Seoul. One of the things the person warned is the pollution and said anyone coming to Korea should invest in a mask. They also said that the Spring is one of the worst times for air pollution. My question: is this true? If yes, do you recommend buying a mask?I'm going in May and I just want to be prepared. Thank you."
Yes. There are days TV news recommend trying masks on.
"The root cause is in China. This is the common spring problem among northern China, South Korea, and western Japan. Beijing is usually much worse. Mask can be found at various places."
Thank you!
There is an app that you can download on your phone. It provides you with daily info on air pollution + pollen etc. Based on the info you can decide if you want to get a mask. You can buy plenty in every convenience store in korea.
"Hi, what is the name of the App you mentioned about daily air pollution in Korea?Thanks"
I googled the app. Not sure if this is the one everyone is talking about.https://www.airvisual.com/air-quality-app
Thanks for the app. I'm planning a trip to SK in 2021. I'm curious as to whether or not the masks mentioned in another post as being readily available are effective. I've worn masks and respirators for work. The mask type has to be at minimum N95 to be effective against micro particles and microorganisms. Fit testing is mandatory to ensure effectiveness and prevent problems from wearing (being unable to breathe properly.)
"Never found the need for one during our visit to China, Japan and South Korea last spring.However, with the current concerns about health issues, we are rethinking that for our fall visit."
"The annual spring mask depends on the specific weather and you respiratory disease history. Current coronavirus is another issue, actually."
Probably more worrying is the coronavirus.
"Yes, I recommend buying a mask, ""N95 mask""."
