We will be in Riu Tequila next weekend (YEAH) and wondering if the bugs are really that bad. We are tryin to stick to carry on luggage so I might need to go find a little bottle of repellent.thanks so much!
"In all my trips to this area, two have been in October, and I saw not one mosquito... I think like everything else there are seasons for mosquitos, fleas, sea lice, bed lice, roaches, whatever!! (Seems like lot of people complain about bugs, but they travel into countries that are breeding grounds for 99% of the insects..) Go figure that!Bring bug wipes, not bug spray! (They are not ""liquid"" so they can be carried on with your other stuff... ) You will be fine......Until the snakes and lizards get ya! -teasing- Have a great trip, bring plenty of film and lots of laughs! :-)"
Great idea about the wipes! Thanks
"I've never been bothered by mosquitoes in Mexico except for the Crococancun zoo. I think if you plan excursions into the jungle, you definitely want to wear bug spray/wipes, but on the beach, no problem. Better to be safe than sorry."
I highly recommend the bug dope ...read the post from Robert...…yahoo.com/s/…dengue_epidemic
