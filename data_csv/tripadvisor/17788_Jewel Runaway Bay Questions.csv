"We love the reviews and everything we are hearing about JRB and can't wait until our arrival in late February. I have some questions that I hope can be answered in detail if possible. Food:Candlelight dinner under the stars 1 night a week- is this included? Is it worth doing vs the other ala carte options?Managers Dinner- is this a buffet? Also is this worth doing?Not a fan of buffets for dinner but is there a seafood night or any theme that is better than other nights?Entertainment:Does the house band play every night? What type of music?How often do other outside bands play at the resort?Sing along bar- sounds like a good place to sit outside and meet with others, do people actually get involved or is it more of a kick back and listen atmosphere?Pools:The infinity pool looks like the best/main pool and we love to hang out at the swim up bar but concerned about kids using this as their main pool without the water park opening in the near future. Do kids use the swim up bar pool more than the others? Is it an issue?Rooms:Booked a standard room and my only concern is the view. I know we will not have an ocean view or maybe even pool view but was hoping for some type of nice view at night with nice lighting, not just a view of dark jungle. Any recommendation on buildings or roomnumbers (odd even) to achieve this in a standard room? One item of note. Everything I research about this resort sounds great except one re-occurring complaint ""towels"". For all that Scott and the resort seem to be doing the right way why is this simple issue so difficult to resolve? I know it may cost a little bit of money but in the big scope of things I would think this should be resolved by now???"
"The swim up bar is deeper (4') than the kiddie pool (2') but they are attached, so there are kids there. Also this pool gets used for water aerobics. Towels are easy. Grab two fresh at the end of the day and take them back to your room for the next morning. If you can't get fresh then hang them up on the rack on your balcony to dry."
"On thursday night at 6:00 we have a manager's cocktail party in which you meet the managers of the resort with rum punch and hors d'oeuvres and giveaways. After that at 7:00 there is a 6 course meal around the pool deck with a show ""under the stars"" Monday night is a Jamaican Beach party on the beach.House band is on 5 nights a week, Sunday is steel pan orchestra and something else the other night. All kinds of music. two nights but there is a change sometimes with singers. Sing a long and Kareoke usually gets a lot of people involved but we don't consider them an outside band.There are three pools The main pool is the largest in the middle of the resort close to the beach bar. the romance pool is the smaller one by the suites and the infinity pool is midsize but the shallowist thus the kids tend to gravitate towards it. the swimup bar is also at that pool. Water part will come on late this year. Depending upon the person will determine if it is an issue. I can have two people eating the same pizza and one will hate it and the other love it. I had three dryers down I know not anyones problem buy mine. the dryers are working we bought more towels. We have them. We also had 800 people a day here who are writing about it so it will continue until new people come and write other things that we did to annoy them or not. i didn't answer about the rooms because you asked for an opinion and I only do facts. let me know if you have any other questionsScott from JRB"
"Boy, this guy Scott sure knows a lot about the resort. LOL. Gona contact you soon my friend. Getting cold here and need something warm to look forward to.  I'll give you my opinion of the standard room category. The standard room category is just that. A standard room. The view is kinda luck of the draw. You may be looking at the west side fence and perimeter, or you may get lucky and get a nicer garden view. More than likely you will not see and water. Pool or ocean. But highly unlikely you will see a jungle either. The one thing you are very likely to do is sleep, dress, wash up, rest, change, shower, humdee dumdum (before or after shower) hehehe, and sleep, repeat. And be more than comfortable doing so. As for towels like Richard said, either get a few fresh in the afternoon or hang to dry at night and get fresh ones once available.Hope this helps!Enjoy!Cocotel251DrewEdited: 6 years ago "
"Scott thank you for your detailed replies, one of the reasons I chose JRB."
"Thanks Cocotel for the room info. I'm not big on needing a special fancy room, just was hoping for a decent view to wind down the night.Also sounds like most rooms will be getting new furniture this month."
"Im in block 3 facing the French, but there's lights out there and it's perfect to just chill and listen yo the insects also a hammock just outside so it's all good. Been here 2 weeks and have experienced no towel issues - a couple of times have gone to get some to find they had none so went to breakfast by the time I was done they was fully stocked up again. With regards to kids bring in the infinity pool I would think late February there shouldn't be that many kids as they should be set school - there's no many here at the moment so the infinity pool is virtually child free, but to be fair the kids like the middle of the pool as there is a fountain so there's plenty of room for everyone."
"I just wanted to comment about "" late February there shouldn't be that many kids as they should be at school"" . In my area ,the first two weeks of March are spring break for elementary & high schools. So just a head's up that there may be MANY children during that period. We will be arriving for a week with our 2 at the end of February and they love both the pool and the beach. We picked JRB because it's family friendly and we teach our kids to respect everyone, everywhere."
"Is it common in Canada to have a 2 week break late Feb/March? From our experience not many kids at the resorts the last week of February, presidents week is over by then. We have kids or our own that we took on trips for years but just concerned that the pool by the swim up bar seems to be where kids hang out here???"
"Hi dmac, it's only a one week break, however, the region where I live (Quebec) the break is the 1st week of March. Families will be travelling from the wednesday prior depending on best flight/prices etc... The region where I work the break Ontario) is the second week of March...Same thing, people trying to get the best flights etc. Our universities break around the 15th of February. Some of my friends with children that attend all three will travel during the University break so as not to disrupt the older child's stricter schedule. I think the bottom line is if you are going to be annoyed by the presence of children in the pool on your holiday, perhaps an Adult Only is a better choice.I know that this is a sensitive subject for some, but the reality is that the bars, whether swim-up or not, is the only place for the kids to get their drinks whether self-serve or otherwise. I understand that many guest like to lounge and spend alot of time there and you may not wish to get the odd splash in your rum punch but you're in a pool...the likelyhood is high whether the splash comes from a child or not.Happy Travels!"
My son is on break from school for the Mardi Gras holidays. We will be their the first week of March!
Hi Dmac - My husband and I are also going to be at the JRB in late February. Feb. 22nd to Mar. 1st to be exact. When will you be there? Also can anyone suggest a good room (we booked a waterview room) and would like to be on the upper level close to the infinity pool. Any suggestion on a room we should request? Thanks for you help.
"Bafer- we will be there a day after you, please save us some Red Stripe."
Red Stripe is it? That will be different from the el Presidente in Dominican. Do they have any good vodka or should I bring duty free?
"Here is what I found in a previous post about a year ago asking about vodka at the resort:smirnoff, absolute and sky as well. yes on the flavors (flavored vodka).Scott from Jewel."
IMO Red Stripe can be a little over rated here in the states but should be a good beer for an all inclusive. I really liked El Presidente when we were in Punta Cana.
"I loathe buffets but JRB rocks in this area. Clean, fresh, awesome food choices. The amount of Jamaican foods was better than I have seen at any other resort in Jamaica. Some strange but most delish. Best snapper ever.Yes, the infinity pool just happens to be the pool where kids congregate due to the low depth. My fave was the smallest all the way to the west side. Never anyone there. Depends what you want. The inifinity pool was loud, busy, and crowded. There is no bar within 12 feet of the other pool but Miguel will find you and bring your beverages. No loud music there, either. Also, my term for swim up bar is the pee pee pool. Just sit outside of the pool and watch the people drink all day. And nobody exits. All those beverages need to go someplace. Yuck!If you are concerned about the view at night, it's dark. No matter what room you have. Nothing to see. If you are sitting in your room during the day, well, your choice but why?"
"Pee pee pool, LOL. The kids pool is connected too so double whammy. But, these pools are generally designed for a high turnover rate. The water is filtered and treated at a much higher rate so I wouldn't worry too much. Just don't get a mouthful."
Heading to Jewell Runaway Bay Nov. 8th. Does anyone know what is being done to prevent chickungunya virus spread by mosquitos? It is now an epidemic on the island and people are concerned there by the poor response by Department of Public Health.
"We're arriving on the 17th. From what i've seen in previous posts JRB fogs for mosquitos several times a week during the evenings and also mosquitos are more prevalent in areas with standing water, there isn't supposed to be any standing water around the JRB. I stocked up on bug spray to bring with me, but I'd do that anyways because apparently i'm tasty and get bitten way more than my husband ever does. It seems as though this virus is throughout the carribean and has moved into parts of the states. We have west nile up here transmitted by mosquitoes so it's not much different I guess, just something you have to deal with. I'd suggest bringing bug spray with you. Also, maybe some citronella candels for when you're sitting on your balcony in the evenings etc..."
