I am due to travel 21 May and am very unsure whats gonna happen now!
I put that on another thread. I'm due to go 14th. Not much chance now but still just outside the refund dates. Frustrating.
Website still saying 5 May. How did you find that out?
I know because I work for Thomas cook.
Thanks. When are they going to tell everyone else?
"It says 12th on the website now, but Caribbean Warehouse had the update on theirs a couple of hours ago."
"Game over for me then, flying First Choice on the 11th so no doubt they will follow suit."
Thomas Cook still not updated but have now seen Caribbean Warehouse. Just noticed that UK now has 8 confirmed cases. 
I'm due to travel on the 15th. Even if we could get a refund theres nowhere to go. No holiday for me till October 2010 now.
"It's updated for me Leyland.The problem is with transferring holidays, all the flights are full. Thomas Cook added an extra flight to the Dom Rep on the 13th May. It's filling up fast and the prices are stupidly high compared to normal.It would be great if someone could find out how many more flights are being added and destinations. I have to keep ringing Caribbean Warehouse and I'm getting nowhere fast."
"I know this may sound stupid - as I am sure you poor guys have alread looked into it...But here I go...Regardless of whether your chosen holiday company - say Thomas Cook can swap your holiday for you........If you have holiday insurance - does that not cover you for this type of thing - basically the advice is not to go - so you cannot - so the insurance cover should pay for al money you have spent on Mexico. Then you can use the money on totoally different holiday with other company if you want....The only reason I wonder, is my brother was due to go to Turkey a few years back, and then due to fighting in Iraq I think.... the advice was not to travel to Turkey. So he was able to get all the deposit etc back via the insurance cover........Hope you all get something sorted - must be horrible - especially if your one big holiday!!!!! Wishing you all most luck x"
"posted this on the other thread as well but here it goes....have you thought about re-booking with TCook for mexico next year and then just booking another flight sompleace else with someone else?Teletext has great deals and so does airfrance.And your travel insurance wont cover mexico, at least mine wont. mine says that if my flight goes, i have to go. if my flight doesnt go, i should get a refund from the airline so it will have nothing to do with the insurance. i guess the bit on the policy that covers epidemics only kicks in if you happen to already be there when an epidemic hits. very misleading. "
My insurance covers for cancellation if the FCO advises against travel. I think there is a grey area though because the FCO haven't put dates on there advisory. I can't image the tour operators will resume package holidays until the advisory has been lifted. 
"Its not as easy as just booking somewhere else now. Theres 5 of us, that means altering time off with 5 different employers and working around other commitments. Also many of the tour operators have put their prices up. The other slight problem is that my father in law needs a wider seat and that means premium, and guess what..........no availibility."
