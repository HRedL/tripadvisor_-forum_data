With limited Korean skills I haven't figured out how to book online on this website http://www.dandongferry.co.kr/main/main.asp# Could someone with better Korean-skills tell me if it's possible?
ferries from dandong has been temporarily suspended due to the ongoing coronavirus epidemic.
OK. Thanks.
