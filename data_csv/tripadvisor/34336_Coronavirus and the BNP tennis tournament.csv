We are elderly and have series ticket for the tournament. We are becoming concerned about attending. It starts 9 March. Anyone else having the same concerns?
"I'm not sure anyone else's concerns (or lack thereof) should impact your decision. You know the odds of being exposed (low), you know the risk to your own health if you are exposed (high), you know the precautions being recommended. Those are the only factors in which you should make your decision, in my opinion, unless you want to ask your own doctor.(I'm going through the same dilemma myself, being due to leave on a Nile River cruise on Friday. I'm older and have chronic asthma... but I've done my risk assessment and feel it's a reasonable risk to take. My doctor didn't contradict that and just gave me antibiotics in case I develop bronchitis.)"
I’m sure someone else has similar concerns. Question though is whether that is relevant concern. This involves risk......probably low.....and risk tolerance....which is subjective.
My concern would be more for the flight than for being at the tournament. I'd probably still go If I was in your place BUT that's me. You'll have to make up your own mind based on your own health and feeling about the possible risk.
Only you know you and only you can make the decision.
Google just canceled its major developer conference in May out of coronavirus concerns.
"Besides the above, Facebook has decided not to send anyone to the South by Southwest conference in Austin next week. Amazon has told employees to postpone non-essential travel. Nestle told employees to limit domestic and avoid international travel. L'Oreal banned international travel by employees. United announced that change fees will be waived for travel dates between 3/1 and 3/31. Good time to short airline stocks. I wonder how often aircraft are given a good scrub down."
Steve Wozniak is saying he and his wife may have been the first to have been exposed back in January. CDC told them to wash their hands after filling out forms and being hospitalized. His wife was vomiting blood.that's what government can do for you.
The plane flights are increasingly worrying.
"Thank you for all of your replies. Yes, the plane has me worried. Can't stay 6ft away from anyone while on board. Even though open air at the tournament, we stand close in line to enter and at the bathrooms. Especially the practice court seats have us all packed together while watching the top players. I'm going to make my decision this afternoon."

I wouldn't believe anything Steve Wozniak says. He is loony tunes. Plus you don't vomit blood with coronavirus.
His wife says she did not have coronavirus.
BNP Paribas is giving full refunds or creditshttps://bnpparibasopen.com/coronavirus/
"I decided to go again this year but will take suitable precautions. The banning of towel hand offs will make watching Rafa worth the trip alone! As for the risks of flying, that worries me more than the event itself. But life is worth living and the reward far outweighs the risk in my opinion. We will see if I feel different in two weeks as the number of cases inevitably rises."
It is cancelled by health dept declaring emergency due to local case.
Technically it is merely postponed. It was perhaps precipitated by some players choosing not to participate.
Very disappointing news. I just cancelled my hotel (Omni Resort) and they waived all cancellation fees. Nice. WestJet was not so nice as it cost me about $250 to cancel my ticket and was only rebated a portion of the overall cost. I feel for all the businesses in the Indian Wells area who depend on this tourney for a large portion of their annual revenue. I am personally out about $1000 due to the cancellation which is peanuts compared to the hotels and restaurants.
westjet prove again what a crappy airline they are...they charged me cancellation fees too...
