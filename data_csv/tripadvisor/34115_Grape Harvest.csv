"So here are a few facts & figures to ponder before you plan a visit to Wine Country this year during Harvest. Between them, Napa and Sonoma Counties have over 100,000 acres planted to wine grapes. Harvest normally takes place over two to three months, depending on the weather and varietal. When the winemaker says the SE corner of Block 30 is ready to pick, he means NOW, not a week from now, and he wants them all picked within a few hours. This requires teams of 8 to 12 skilled vineyard workers, who are only here for 3 months. These teams work together and are usually paid together for what the team harvests. What’s relevant to the coronavirus is that they all tend to live together, usually in bunkhouses, but sometimes in a ‘friend’s’ house. With say 20 guys in a bunkhouse with 2 bathrooms, it is nearly impossible to maintain safe practices. My ‘back of the napkin calculations’ are that somewhere between 5,000 to 10,000 seasonal workers are required to harvest those 100,000 acres. Admittedly they don’t have a lot of free time!, but they’ve got to eat, put gas in their cars, go to the bank, etc. In other words be out and about in the community.I’m sure that wineries and county health officials are well aware of the situation. And I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt that they’re going to do what they can to make things safe, but I’m having a hard time imagining how that’s going to work. It’s possible that between the virus, and immigration restrictions, there simply won’t be much of a harvest this year.Bottom line, imo, is that between this influx of seasonal workers and the possible opening of schools, let’s just stay hunkered down for a few more months."
Do you work in the industry? Do you have friends who do? I would ask them. Each winery I am sure is addressing. Good points - but it would be interesting to also find out who you have talked to about this.
"Please don't visit the wine country until 2050. BTW where is CA Dreamer? Her posts were not very coherent but, unlike a few others, were not venomous."
"Mimi, Yes I did work in the industry for over 10 years. Not a tasting room. I have been inside the bunkhouses, signed up seasonal workers, walked thru the vineyards, was personal friends with winemakers and their staffs, etc. Nothing I wrote is controversial, it's common knowledge within the industry. As I said, I'm sure the employers and the county health departments will all do their best this harvest, but as has been amply demonstrated if you have a bunch of people all living in the same tight quarters, it takes only one infected person to spread the virus.vnrose, 2050? Where did that come from? And ""venomous""? Towards whom?"
Thanks for letting me know. Sounds like you have very good first hand knowledge and agree with you. Been following closely all these goings on in the Press Democrat and the Napa newspaper - and it looks like some wineries today started their harvest but in a very toned down way. Thanks again for your valuable insights. Very much appreciated and thanks so much for answering my question. We have some family members too who work in the win industry and its been a challenging year for all. Best to you and yours.

"vnrose is sarcastically telling everyone on assorted threads not to go anywhere until 2050, a snipe at people who are urging caution and moderation in travel. Locals here are not suggesting people make prisoners of themselves for the next few decades, but should seriously consider how necessary a trip is and then commit to doing everything they can to protect themselves and those who must live in the destination locations. That is reasonable advice and doesn't call for a snotty response."
"I like vnroses posts. Getting real tired of the same posters, some of who seem to change accounts after they disappear. KInda like tired of the violent rioters up here. (Thank you Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler for finally taking charge). The message is diluted and being tuned out. So you know, I am a very liberal democrat and now more then ever. Vote!So I've conversed with mini a bit about winery visits. Up here we have very done several winery excursions throughout the WV and the Columbia Gorge. Now I think Portland area people are real covid savvy as has been our experiences. Everyone is doing the right things. Everyone has been extremely covid responsible and it has been a very nice experience. So are you people saying if we wanted to come visit Napa/Sonoma that we shouldn't? Not that I am(not likely) but it's really up to the wineries and businesses to send out the message of what they feel is alright.It's interesting to read what people's idea of acceptable distances to travel are, depending on all our whims and desires and what one deems right for them. Coastal and mountain areas are not just for those who live close by. Public lands. Be careful, do the right things. It's easy.Bring on the vaccines!"
"Acceptable distances has to with visiting another area that may have much higher rates of infection and then you possibly getting ill and exposing people in your town with lower rates and vice versa. Also a longer car trip means more stops, which means more chances of infection. Common sense. You might not live in a tourist area, but when your numbers go 180 around the last week of June to 1,200 3 weeks after the 4th of July you might understand the concerns of those that live in tourist areas. You would be surprised how many visitors ignore local mandates. With gusto. It’s why many counties are now fining people for not complying.Edited: 11:49 pm, August 06, 2020 "
Too late to edit: The post didn’t say not to visit. The fall and the crush are popular times to visit. Many seasonal workers will be coming into the area and it has already been proven that migrant living conditions have been spreading Covid. The post was to provide info if someone is going. Maybe they want to wait or sooner. If you look at each county with agriculture the majority of the cases are in the ag areas. Here in a tool from LA Times where you can look up outbreaks by county. https:/…
"Thank you all for helping me explain. People look at the wine country and seem to think - ""it's beautiful, refined, spread out - surely my chances of catching COVID are slim here."" I'm trying to lay out the facts of what goes on behind the scenes. You're all free to do what you want with that information, but personally it would add to my list of reasons not to travel for just a few more months.I have high hopes that a vaccine will be developed in the next 6 months or so. I doubt it will eradicate the virus, but hopefully it will reduce the risk enough that we can all resume our lives. What punctures that hope are stories of huge parties in the Hollywood hills, or people insisting on traveling for their 'mental health'. We are so spoiled. A generation ago people took a weeks vacation once a year, if they were lucky. During WWII my grandmother told how she'd avoid streets in SF with street car tracks - to save her car tires so production could go to the war effort. Where is that social responsibility today?"
"Erica T, just think my grandmother’s family would sit in the dark for hours during air raids without a complaint. Well I’m sure their was a complaint but they did it. All that and there never was a German or Japanese attack on the mainland. People are just being asked to either wait for a trip or take one closer to home and suddenly that’s a big deal. I missed my trip to Kauai this year and I hope I don’t miss our trip to Greece and Italy next year. It’s not like we don’t travel. I want this thing gone so I can freely leave the country again.Edited: 12:53 am, August 07, 2020 "

#8As if anyone from Oregon would understand the daily lives of Californians let alone during a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
"Ah, the harvest/crush.Some wineries DO have events (in other years), but now, things are different.Most wineries are interested in the harvest, and doing the best that they can.This is an important time, and tourists should not try to insinuate themselves, into the mix.This is business. This is life.Most often, wineries, in general, do not want hoards of tourists, mucking up the works, for the perceived glamor of the harvest/crush.2020 is not the time, to want to “stomp the grapes.”Maybe next year?Hunt"
