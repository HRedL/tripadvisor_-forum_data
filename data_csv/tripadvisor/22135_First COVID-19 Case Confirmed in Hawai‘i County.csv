"The Hawai‘i Department of Health now lists on its website one presumptive positive case of COVID-19 in Hawai‘i County.According to the state website, there are 13 total cases: eight in Honolulu County; two in Kaua‘i County; two in Maui County; and now one in Hawai‘i County.“While we do not yet have an indication of community transmission, these introductions are concerning, and each represents an opportunity for COVID-19 to spread in our state,” DOH officials state. “Now is the time for everyone in our community to practice social distancing (i.e., maintain at least six ft distance or two arm’s length, whichever is longer, from others) to protect especially those who are most vulnerable in our community.”The state Department of Land and Natural Resources today announced the temporary closure of the following state parks on the Big Island, effective Wednesday:— ‘Akaka Falls State Park— Kekaha Kai State Park— Wailoa River State Recreation Area— Wailuku River State Park— Hapuna Beach State Recreation Area— Kiholo State Park ReserveThe DLNR said caretakers will continue to maintain, monitor and service parks during these closures. Camping and pavilion use permits are suspended. Vendors and concessions are being contacted with cease-of-operations instructions.DLNR said the parks are being closed “to help reduce the potential spread of COVID-19.”"
"The case here on Hawaii Island is a tourist from the mainland, who brought COVID-19 here with them.PLEASE don't travel to Hawaii at this time! As Danipo notes above, all state parks are being shut down to help reduce the potential spread. Please do your part and stay put in your home state or country."
"From what I can gather, cruise ship passengers are still being allowed to visit the island. Is this correct? I read that they are being scanned for a fever before coming ashore, but everyone seems to agree that the virus can be transmitted by people with no symptoms. I can’t help but wonder why they are still being welcomed on the island."
I don't believe any cruises are still operating.
Yes there's a few cruise ships still out there. I believe the Pride of America's passengers will be screened when they disembark. There are two international cruises headed for Honolulu Harbor that will be allowed to re-stock supplies and refuel but their passengers won't be allowed to get off the ship. Those poor people can't find anywhere that will let them dock and get off. My heart goes out to them.
NCL and Pride of America suspended operations until at least April already.........................like over a week ago.
"Here's an update about the 2 international ships (and note the fact that POA operations were suspended March 14, along with all other cruises):https:/…"
Good to hear about Pride of America!!
I am glad to hear this!
"This is even better---Lt. Gov is calling for a mandatory 2 week quarantine for ALL arrivals:""Lt. Gov. Josh Green is calling for the suspension of all non-essential travel to Hawaii and the closure of all businesses and schools until April 30 to prevent a mass outbreak of the coronavirus in the islands.Green, who is also a practicing emergency room doctor on the Big Island and leading community efforts for widespread testing, said the state should also mandate a two-week quarantine for anyone entering Hawaii, “contact test” every positive case and completely isolate them and begin screening all passengers at local airports.""Something I and some others have been talking about for weeks.........here's hoping it happens.SW"
4 more new cases on Oahu today.....and 2 on Maui.
"Lt. Gov says it's 11 new, not 6:https:/…I think I believe him."
"They dickered some more, LOL.........now it's a total of 10. I think they aren't counting the Tripler case.The Maui people are residents who returned from Europe with symptoms."
"Puuhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park and Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park are both closed due to concerns over the coronavirus.Hawaii Volcanoes National Park remains open, however, the Kilauea Visitor Center is closed as the coronavirus pandemic continues.Edited: 4:56 pm, March 20, 2020 "
The DLNR is closing Kealakekua Bay to all activities until April 4th. They’ll continue the closure past the 4th if necessary.
"Community members have closed Manini Beach, Hōnaunau Beach, and Miloliʻi Beach. Hoʻokena is working on their closure plan."
"I think it's great closures are ramping up there on the BI.Haleakala Ntl Park has closed totally, effective tonight. Maybe VNP is going to as well?"
"As of this afternoon, there are two more cases – both at Kona Community Hospital, reportedly tourists."
Is Harry waking up????
"Sorry, dupe!Edited: 12:56 am, March 21, 2020 "
https:/…special-alerts-informationEven the tourism agency says don't come. But Hawaii County stands out as not issuing covid guidance. For shame. Glad we chose not to retire there.
