"From tomorrow 17th March, the Gili Islands (Trawangan, Meno and Air) will close their harbours for 14 days.Although the Gili Islands are in Lombok, many visitors go there from Bali."
Hey Lynnepp I contacted my accommodation on Gili Air to cancel last night and this morning they have contacted me to tell me that I can still get there by public boat. So its all bit confusing at the moment.
"Sorry Eddie, your accommodation is wrong."
"According to news in Australia (sorry I could not link the nine news wa today site) those already in the Northern Gilis Air, Meno and Trawangan can see out their already booked accommodation . But no foreigners can now enter these Islands. Please everybody stay as safe as you can, as this will help local people and other travellers. Who would have thought our world would be so compromised.Tried not to say this but I will ... Bali will be next."
Ok I tried harder here is a linkHoliday islands close down over coronavirus fears https:/…d299eb97-bb29-487e-b4c7-900e7a14a8bd
I can give you a link in Bahasa Indonesia but most would not understand it.
All boats stop tomorrow! Today is the last day
"Don’t know for how long but for now.Kelly Goldie the Admin on the Loving Lombok Facebook page has just written, that it is only the fast boats that have been stopped.You can apparently still fly and catch the slow ferry.My thoughts are with everyone travelling at the moment, the tourism industry as well as our local friends."
"That's right Kath, just read from Gilitransfers fanpage, Slow ferry from Padangbai to Lembar harbor still open with a stricter checking. West Nusa Tenggara gov. only stopped all access to Gili Islands and Senggigi harbor. Regards"
You can get to Lombok but not the Gili Islands.
