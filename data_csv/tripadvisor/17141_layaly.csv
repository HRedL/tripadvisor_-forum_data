"hi all,who can tell me about the ""Lou loua beach hotel""thx."
It's on the beach in Sharjah. Right next to Port Khalid. It will be full of Russians.
is it good or bad hotel? can u answer pls?
Good or bad as compared to what?
"is it clean? is the service good? i will go with my family, and i never been in sharjah.is it safe? thx for ur answers."
Let's just say that it is 'fit for purpose'. It will be safe unless the kitchen staff come down with a botulism epidemic.
"I hate to say this but, generally speaking, if there is a comment abt Russians, it means it isn't quite up to par. I don't know abt this place, but that's what I would read fm that comment, personally speaking. Is the Marbella Residence still there? That used to be okay I think?"
"Funny, when i was there there was no ""russian invasion"". There were few russians but not as more than fex. americans wich i find more annoying :). And actually thinking go back there again in winter with my family... You actually have to read these forums with ""filters on"", many writings are totally bullshit. And as for alcohol consuming in sharjah, i had a few beers with me in beach and in swimming pool area and HAD ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEMS with anybody!!! "
"Good for you Mr./Ms Finland, just keep recommending that to everyone. Everything is down to personal choice. 'We suggest and recommend, but what each person does is down to them. We share with them our experiences and knowledge from this part of the world and what they do with that is, again, down to them! You go for it and keep on drinking alcohol in a dry area that is funded by Saudi! I wish you much happiness for the future. Take this to mean that I think what your comment is total b*******!"
