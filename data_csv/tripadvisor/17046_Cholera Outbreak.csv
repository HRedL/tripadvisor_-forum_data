Traveling to Havana Cuba in 21 days. Anyone else concerned about the Cholera Outbreak and the limited official information from the Cuban government?
There are already one or two threads on this subject.
“There are already one or two threads on this subject.”*****Here is the link to a recent thread:“http://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g147270-i91-k5559919-Cholera_in_granma-Cuba.html - 42038794”and here is the link to a recent BBC article:bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18758325

"The Cuban government has informed of a Cholera epidemic and more than 3000 cases of "" Acute Diarrhea"" that has not been identified in clear terms. The official press informed about 85 cases of Cholera, but the rest of the thousands of cases of diarrhea have not been linked by the authorities to any agent. These error leaves numerous questions about the Cuban Health Ministery (MINSAP) seriousness and has risen suspiction of a cover up of epidemiological data to avoid scaring potential tourists to the island. These has been the opinion of Ileana Ros Lethinen from the US Congress. It would be recommended to avoid traveling to the eastern part of the island where the epidemic has impacted most and to obtain a vaccination againts cholera after the appropriate medical consultations before traveling. Haiti, geographically next to Cuba, is still facing the worst Cholera epidemic in modern times. Visit the CDC website www.Cdc.gov/cholera/general for more information in how to avoid Cholera infection, symptoms and treatments.Edited: 8 years ago "
"Ileana Ros Lethinen is a republican politician born in Havana and currently living in Florida. Gheeez, I wonder if her views will be in the slight bit biased against anything the Cuban gov't claims????? Sorry but she is not a source that I will personally go to for accurate information on this subject. Similarly, at the other end, the Cuban rag Granma doesn't seem to be saying anything about this subject which I guess makes them just as useless. ---------------------------------------------------------""It would be recommended to avoid traveling to the eastern part of the island where the epidemic has impacted most....""And from link you have provided.........Should I Be Worried About Getting Cholera From Others?The disease is not likely to spread directly from one person to another; therefore, casual contact with an infected person is not a risk for becoming ill.How Can I Avoid Getting Cholera?The risk for cholera is very low for people visiting areas with epidemic cholera. When simple precautions are observed, contracting the disease is unlikely. Drink only bottled, boiled, or chemically treated water and bottled or canned carbonated beverages. When using bottled drinks, make sure that the seal has not been broken. Avoid tap water, fountain drinks, and ice cubes.Wash your hands often with soap and clean water. If no water and soap are available, use an alcohol-based hand cleaner (with at least 60% alcohol).Clean your hands especially before you eat or prepare food and after using the bathroom. Use bottled, boiled, or chemically treated water to wash dishes, brush your teeth, wash and prepare food, or make ice. Eat foods that are packaged or that are freshly cooked and served hot. Do not eat raw and undercooked meats and seafood or unpeeled fruits and vegetables.I plan to be in Manzanillo this autumn. According to CDC link article you provided, I shouldn't have to worry if I am careful and prepared.Edited: 8 years ago "
"Epidemic of cholera in Cuba may spread without even the population being informed. According to worldwide press the government has not disclosed all the cases of cholera probably imported from Haiti by Cuban medical personel. There is a risk of the disease becoming endemic: this means becoming part of the diseases that a person may acquire in a simple vacation trip. Cholera is contagious and it is already endemic in countries like Bangladesh and India. It cause death by dehydration, meningitis and shock. Cholera do not respect ages, believes or whealth. Tchaikovski died from cholera, so Clar von Clausewick. It would be wise to avoid risks, especially for children, older individuals, and person affected by other conditions. Consult your doctor before traveling and keep yourself informed from trusted sources. empowher.com/cholera/content/cuba-cholera-ou… This is a serious matter about health and risks of dying. Do not get tangled in politics."
huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/09/cuba-cholera-o… More about Cuban cholera. Stay informed.
Cuban cholera reaches Havana...this doesn't sound like a vacation to me.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18758325
Got any actual up to date information? All of the above has been noted previously on this forum.
newsmax.com/Newsfront/…445057 Cuba has not provided World Health Organization office in Havana with more updates about the Cholera epidemics.
"You know, governments everywhere tend to keep a lid on unpleasant information. I wouldn't read anything into it, myself. There are so many visitors to Cuba that information will be available sooner rather than later if there actually is much spread of this problem. Of course, there are interests in Miami that would love to see this impact the tourist business, and they will try their best to spin things out of proportion. Any flu outbreak would be far more of a public health concern, due to the method of transmission. Cholera is less of an issue except where sanitary facilities are lacking, which might describe parts of rural Cuba, but doesn't really apply to the places tourists frequent."
My own personal opinion is that we maybe are making too much of this. It seems to me that any little thing that happens in Cuba is usually blown up out of all proportions on these forums.
"So ivyqui, the answer to your question is that josetonysoto is extremely concerned over cholera and everything else about Cuba. Its a very scary world for out there for him. Think happy thoughts."
"josetonysoto, are you actually going to Cuba? If not, what's with getting your panties in a tangle about what may or may be not going on there?"
"Gee, someone joins this week to launch a tirade against the Cuban government. That sounds like a bunch of political stuff. But please, don't anybody report any of those posts. It's important to understand what kind of people we have in this world."
"…cdc.gov/eid/article/17/7/11-0059_article.htm Please do not make this a political battle ground. This is about an unfortunate crisis that is being covered up. No body has question Haiti because of their transparence and the clarity of information expressed by reputable sources. Ileana Ros Letihnen is a Member of Congress and is calling attention about disclosure of information about an epidemic. By the way she was born in Cienfuegos and yes, she is biased and not a bit, but a lot for those Cubans than has been imprinsoned in Cubans jails for demanding freedom of speech. Anybody should be able to travel or not to travel. The fact is an epidemic, serious, concerning. The incubation period 6 to 48 hours http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8407/. Yes, it is serious, so the experts say."
"First of all. I do not were panties. I am proudly a man, as my name indicate. Second, I am not defending or criticizing the Cuban government but citing specific press information, reliable and public. I believe that on the other hand you are too worried for your own personal interest in Cuba, in his politics and your Sterling Pounds or Canadian Dollars. Get real and read, the truth will set you free.Edited: 8 years ago "
"From CTV's site in Canada;The Public Health Agency of Canada is warning travellers about the outbreak of cholera in Cuba, a destination that’s long been popular with Canadian tourists.ctvnews.ca/health/canadian-tourists-warned-a…They are not advising people not to go to Cuba but to take some basic precautions which have been mentioned on the other threads.Edited: 8 years ago "
"JoseTonySoto Yes, I know you are a man but you are still getting your panties in a knot about something that apparently isn't going to affect you. Just seems rather strange to join a forum and post about nothing else, other than something that doesn't concern you!I wish I was going to Cuba next week! Nothing I've read would bother me."
"""Please do not make this a political battle""Good words, but ....."
"from post 17.'' Get real and read, the truth will set you free...Is that not just the truth !!!!!!!!!!!!!?"
We have just returned from Cuba this morning and the first I heard about this outbreak was back on British soil.
Just had a text from my friend in Cuba and she tells me that they are being told to avoid rivers and to wash their hands all the time.
"I'm leavin for Cuba next Monday, and I am not worried at all, just going to follow the precautions and everything will be fine. Going to stay away from lettuce, seafood and tap water!!"
the truth will set you freebut first it will make you miserable
The truth is out there. We just want to know where it is?
"she is biased and not a bit, but a lot for those Cubans than has been imprinsoned in Cubans jails for demanding freedom of speech. -------------------------The Cuban five. heard of them and their injustice?****************************************************Anybody should be able to travel or not to travel.------------------And the Americans are free to travel to Cuba whenever they want are they?sorry; just had to mention those points."
"I follow the Jamaican forums on TA as well.Same thing happened when a Cholera outbreak occurred a little while ago in Jamaica. Lot's of concerned tourist posting at that time. Understandable, but when all was said and done it turned out to be a non-issue for travelers to Jamaica. I'm sure the same will happen in regards to Cuba."
"Well when hurricane season starts for real, then the cholera posts will be replaced by... Will Hurricane x , y , z, ruin my holiday?"
diva:They will also be spread across all the sub forums too.
"Diva; all hurricanes have been cancelled this year, snow is forecasted for mid August so that will hopefully freeze dry all the bugs, September should bring intermittent sunshine along with increased numbers of flies likely causing outbreaks of sickness and diarrhoea through into October and November ~ So interesting times ahead Im sure."
"LL, :( I thought we had the monopoly on Snaw up here in the North, but I am happy to share.Now is the S&D due in Oct / Novemeber after the 23rd?"
cbc.ca/news/…cuba-cholera.html Canadian and European Health Advisory about Cuban Cholera epidemic.
"Cubans are not allowed to travel anywhere in the world without an expressed permission from the dictatorship called ""the white card"". Cubans are not allowed to return to their motherland if they publucly express disagreement with the so called revolution. Cubans are not allowed to watch foreign television channels in their homes if they so desire to place a simple home made antenna. Cubans are not simply allow to Google, not even this free and civilized dialogue that we are mantaining. And 5 spies will remain in jail for spying on Boca Chica American military base i Key West where you probably love to go to have mojitos and enjoy Hemingways life style."
They have the identical advisory about the Dominican Republic. :-)
"""Jose can't you see"" that the Cuban government reported the outbreak on July 6. If they were hiding something why would they bother?"
"It is absolutely normal for various Canadian government departments to issue advisories in a whole array of areas as it is consistent with public awareness campaigns.We routinely receive (through the media) advisories concerning road conditions and the need to exercise caution during winter storms.We routinely receive (through the media) advisories about “smog alerts”, and the need for some people with specific respiratory conditions to exercise caution in their activities.We routinely receive (through the media) advisories concerning recalls of various products, including food products that may be contaminated.We routinely receive (through the media) boil-water advisories when there is concern that our water treatment facilities may be compromised.We routinely receive (through the media) advisories concerning lake contamination, advising swimmers to avoid swimming in specific lakes due to contamination.We routinely receive (through the media) advisories reminding people not to leave their pets in a vehicle during the summer.The list goes on. This advisory is of the same nature, There is NO question that any outbreak of cholera needs attention, but there is no need for the scare-mongering that is taking place (imho).What's the fear-level colour in the States today?"

"""Cubans are not allowed to return to their motherland if they publucly express disagreement with the so called revolution.""So Jose .....of those thousands of ""Cuban Americans"" who return to Cuba every year NOT ONE has ever expressed diagreement with the objectives of the Cuban government?"
I wonder how Jose knows so much about somewhere he's presumably never visited? O let me think - google and the US press. Very reliable methods of information hahaha! Obsessed is the word that springs to mind!
LeylandSunaddict:He's just one of those Cuban Americans with an agenda that pop into the forum from time to time to try to stir things up.
"Leyland .. Jose is the type that will tell you only ""communists"" spread propaganda."
Well he's making a pigs ear of it Bellagio! I hope he doesn't give up his day job lol!
"Any new news from a different source, not just hear say?"
Sunandfun ... here is a report from CNN's Patrick Oppmann.cnn.com/2012/…index.html
"And, Here's the latest one I had found a couple of days ago:reuters.com/article/2012/07/14/cuba-cholera-…"
"I think that the last paragraph in that article says it al...ATB,J."
New news is needed about the Cholera outbreak. The Cuban government has done little to keep its citizens and the travelling public informed. All reports are now over a week old. A reliable and trustworthy entity needs to step up and give more and acurate cholera outbreak info as regards to travel inside Cuba. I am concerned for my families health and do not want to fall ill while in Cuba.
"Sunandfun ...If there is no ""news"" out of Miami then everything is more than better. LOLWhere are you going and where are you lodging?"
"SENIOR RADAR .very concerned about cholera and dengue on the island and especially Havana area. Getting sick in a country were running water and airconditioning is a luxury item, and not found in Cuban hospitals is not for me or my family. My favorite news source is the JAMACIAN OBSERVER. I have to read news from other sources because we all know what comes from the Revolutionary Gov. Is always is Fidels news.  I am staying in various Casa Particular some legal some not. The ones not licensed have better amedities. ALSO The families keep more of their rents... I take them packaged spices from Goya that they love. I HAVE LOTS OF RESPECT for the everyday Cuban who has to live full time in that prison camp. Not my first Rodeo there Radar. ARE YOU THE BOARD COP? ITS PRESS PRESS YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT? Tell your frens at Granma to do new story for the concerned. I'm ready to scrub my trip as I like comfort and Cubas best just barely cuts it. OK Radar."
"""I'm ready to scrub my trip as I like comfort and Cubas best just barely cuts it.""Excellent idea, IMHO. Why would you want to go somewhere if you are that worried about it? And you are right, there is Dengue in Cuba (and the DR, and Mexico, and......etc.) And stay away from North Carolina and Florida. They have been experiencing outbreaks of eastern equine encephalitis, which can be deadly for both humans and horses.Edited: 8 years ago "
"Why did you book in Cuba in the first place if it ""just barely cuts it""?"
sunandfun2012:Best thing you could do IMHO is to stay away from Cuba.Edited: 8 years ago 
"eeeefarm; Thanks for the info about the outbreak of Eastern Equine Encephalitis in Florida. “He who cannot be named” was kicking up his heels to go to the Battle of the Barns Pleasure Show in Florida later this month. Good time to avoid Florida, no question. LOLI agree with you, Bellagio."
"""sunandfun2012:Best thing you could do IMHO is to stay away from Cuba.""I second that emotion."
