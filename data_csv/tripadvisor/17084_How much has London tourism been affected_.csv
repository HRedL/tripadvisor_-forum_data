"This forum has kept my hope up about going to London regardless of the Coronavirus situation. But I am curious as to how much has London tourism been affected by Coronavirus. I am hoping the situation will get better over the next few weeks and that we can visit most, if not all, of the attractions we plan to visit. I hope none will be closed down while we are in London."

"I have not seen any recent updates on London tourism numbers, but others likely have their fingers on the pulse of such.Are you a travel writer, looking for info, or a traveler?If the latter, what, exactly, is it, that you wish to know?Best of luck,Hunt"
"I just want to know the trend (decline in tourists). I am guessing there will be less tourists from Asia, especially China and South Korea but I am not sure what percentage of tourists in London are from Asia. I just hope London stay safe and open business as usual in the next few weeks or months. I am just a traveler from the US, first time to Europe so I am super excited but also afraid of the possibility of having to cancel my trip should things get worse."
Check this for quick up to date analysis... http://worldometers.info/coronavirus/
"We were just in London. The only thing we heard from a local is that the very high end shops are suffering a bit due to the lack of tourists from Asia.On our travels we met others from the US and numerous other European countries. There were lines at most attractions, though never over 20 minutes."
I’ve just had a US visitor so we went out a lot in Central London and it seemed as busy as ever there and on the tube. But of course anything could change now anywhere in the world. Don’t book anything where you can’t get your money back if you are legally prevented from going.
"I haven't noticed fewer people in London, it's just as busy as always. A few people walking around with masks on now and all shops seem to have run out of hand sanitiser, but that's about it."
"We were doing touristy things in London last week and London seemed as busy as ever.Saying that, the Chinese restaurant we went to (not Chinatown) was almost empty.Down in Bath, I am still seeing Asian tourists (but they could easily be UK residents on a day-trip and/or some of the thousands of students who come over to study at our University). I know some language schools have had blocks of students cancel, which has implications for some host families and local businesses, but most people are unaffected.It is early days, but I think most fit and well families are carrying on as normal."
"I'll be in London in 3 weeks (18th to 22nd March) and not worried at all.I just hope this virus doesn't spread too much here (Austria) or in the UK and it would affect my plans (flights cancelled etc). I already bought tickets for musicals/theatre, Potter Studios and an exhibition and would be pissed if I wouldn't be able to go.I'll stay at an Airbnb, so unlikely to be quarantined, no other guest who could show symptoms or getting tested positive.I'm in Vienna (Austria: 5 confirmed cases at the moment)."
"Just got back from 3 days in London and it's business as usual. Hardly saw anybody wearing face masksThink this is a total overreaction. Up to 30,000 flu deaths each year globally and nobody bats an eyelid. 2,000 COVID deaths and the world goes bonkers. Financial markets crashing, flights cancelled, people having to isolate themselves (after they have become infectious, so pointless exercise). Makes me wonder if that Extinction Rebellion lot are behind the whole thing"
"I haven't noticed anything different. Certainly everyone seems to be at work as usual. The ballet last night was sold out and the theatre looked full to me, although there was a man wearing a face mask in the row behind me. And the tube home was pretty crowded too. I guess things might change over the next few months but there's certainly no sign of hysteria here."
"I don’t know when your trip is but for any trip we always get travel insurance. There are many types and not everything is covered so you have to research what is best for you and your family.........medical, medical evacuation, trip interruption, lost baggage, trip delay, etc. Most policies have restrictions unless you purchase the more costly “cancel for any reason” policy. We also try not to lay out much in advance and never book non flexible, pay now hotel rates, etc.The question of travel safety is really up to your tolerance. My wife has a lower tolerance than I have. You can get sick at home just as easily as you can on any trip........however you are more likely to be in crowded situation on a trip......airports, planes, public transportation, shows, sites, etc. Really depends on what you are comfortable with. Our trip to London is in September so it is a wait and see on how this “pandemic” develops.Edited: 5:40 am, February 28, 2020 "
"I feel some people are not grasping the implications of the coronavirus outbreak.The chances that you will catch coronavirus in the UK are very, very low - at least at the moment.The chances that your trip will be disrupted due to measures put in place to stop the spread of coronavirus are much, much higher.The Swiss have just temporarily banned all public events with expected attendance over 1,000. This is a drastic measure, and while I cannot see the UK copying it exactly, it is quite possible that some large events may not go ahead. If you can't cancel or delay your trip, as mentioned in #12 - get travel insurance."
"As far as I can see, not at all."
There yesterday and just as busy as ever.
"Yes we have travel insurance. We can cancel our hotel one day before arrival without any fee. We have only booked WB HP studio, Parliament tour, and Heathrow Express so the loss is for these three is only about £150. The travel insurance that we bought while booking our flights using Skymile doesn’t cover much but we will get money back if we have to cancel and re-deposit the miles back if the reason of cancellation is covered. I am more worried about not able to go outside my control and being locked down at the hotel if someone in the hotel tested positive. Plus the “epidemic” is excluded on the travel insurance so I think we will not be covered if we have to stay longer or have any medical expenses caused by Coronavirus."
"If I had travel plans for let’s say the next 4-6 weeks with so much uncertainty, I would have a difficult time convincing my wife to go. You have to go with your gut feelings and level of tolerance. Being away from home and the support you have is anxious enough without any unforeseen effects of the current health situation. We had a cruise scheduled for December and just cancelled it.......our September London/Edinburgh is a wait and see right now."
"66 Million people in the UK.19 Cases.To put that in perspective, that’s 1 in every 3,450,000.All have visited one of the infected Countries like Iran, Italy and China.Oh and so far, no Deaths!"
"Re post #18. I don't think people are necessarily concerned about catching the illness or even dying, but more to do with what the situation is regarding day to day life in the city. At the moment everything is normal, but if there was to be an outbreak here I suspect it would cause considerable disruption as in the effected areas in China and Italy. As it is schools are already start to shut in the UK as a result."
"On our TV news, there were photos of St Marks Square in Venice, looking deserted. London is nothing like that.All the reported cases are in (or have been in) specialist isolation hospitals or quarantine. There has been no mass contamination event in the UK as there seems to have been in South Korea, Italy and Iran. There has been little or no person-to-person infection in the UK.However, shares in travel companies like airlines have plummeted in the expectation that people will cancel travel plans. And posts like this will encourage people not to travel and so it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.Yes, don't travel to risky areas, but where there is minuscule risk, why not continue with your plans?"
"#19, you are so right! Yes I want to go on with my plan. I could appreciate less crowded attractions as long as they don’t look deserted. I want to enjoy London at its fullest of energy and excitement. I don’t want to be interrupted with quarantine should someone in the airplane or in the hotel tested positive. I want to be out and about during my 7-8 days in London (I will be there in 4 weeks). I am not worried about getting Coronavirus because if I get then I won’t be able to go out and about anyway. Being locked down while you are well and could have been out doing things is painful emotionally.Edited: 8:58 am, February 28, 2020 "
"The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has put some countries on their 3 stages of alert, and the UK isn't on any of them now. But that means here nor there when it comes to travel next week, or next month. https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/And for some, it's not nervousness about getting sick. It's about wasting time and money to go play tourist and not being able to do touristy things.And travel insurance (unless you pay for cancel any reason) only covers you if you actually contract the virus, not because you're worried about it.It's really a rock and a hard place for near-time visitors, as so much had to be paid upfront.Edited: 9:05 am, February 28, 2020 "
"Judging by the ludicrously long queue (in the pouring rain!) for the security check at the British Museum today, I'd say the impact on the number of tourists visiting London is nil.A few people wearing face masks, and being looked at with ridicule by fellow visitors, and yet leaving the toilet without washing their hands because they seem to assume sanitiser will do.Edited: 10:14 am, February 28, 2020 "
"#23, good to know! Thank you! I appreciate the responses from all of you.If any of you reading this post are currently in London , can you please provide update? Thank you so much"
">>A few people wearing face masks, and being looked at with ridicule by fellow visitors, and yet leaving the toilet without washing their hands because they seem to assume sanitiser will do.<<That's disgusting. It's always disgusting but now it's also ridiculously stupid if they're wearing the masks...!"
"The same group were all carrying selfie sticks, so I think 'stupid' is a fair assessment of them generally, but yes, who leaves a public toilet without washing their hands. Gross!Edited: 10:43 am, February 28, 2020 "
">>If any of you reading this post are currently in London , can you please provide update?<<I walked from my place in Islington to Russell Square for work this morning.

"It’s good to see that London (much like NYC) has been business as usual lately. I’m planning to go to London the first week in June and have been watching these forums like a hawk all week. I know the situation is so fluid but I hope I can still go with no issues! I’m also hoping that there is *some* merit to the idea that the warmer weather might lessen the risk a bit, but I realize nobody knows."
I agree that wait and see is the only logical approach at this time. One of my concerns is the lack of worldwide testing and treatment so who really knows how many people going about their normal business in London or NYC are infected.
"It's not just London and NYC, martyap. That's the question around the world because it's flu season. How many people are or were infected who are/were treated for the flu?One of the (now) confirmed austrian Coronavirus cases is an elderly man who already was a critically ill 'flu' patient at one of our hospitals for 10 days before he even got tested for COVID-19. Now he is quarantined, all his visitors and hospital staff, doctors, nurses have been tested (negative).He wasn't tested because he didn't travel and no one he has been in contact with travelled during the weeks prior to his contagion. His 'patient 0' is unknown."
"Well, it's ""relatively"" warmer in the Southern hemisphere but the outbreak has just started there. Let's see if there is a statistically significant difference in the rate of spread of infection in the southern hemisphere compared to the northern hemisphere"
I spent time in tourist London (Kings Cross and Oxford Street) yesterday and the day before and it struck me that it was business as usual. In two days I only saw one youngish man on the tube wearing a mask.Politicians are scared to be seen doing nothing so I wonder is something may result from a Cobra meeting called for Monday but I don't see the point of cancelling anything or closing stadiums and other places where people will gather unless cases of local to local infection are reported.
"jtwiz – I think that’s very understandable. A lot of people are feeling the same way. An Italian student of mine has booked to go home to Rome for the Easter break. She's now thinking of cancelling even though she won't get a refund on the flight and will be stuck in her student house on her own outside of term time rather than being back home with her family. The alternative of course is potentially much worse, which is that she's unable to get back into the UK without potentially going in quarantine and missing important exams."
"We are set to travel to London next Friday and I'm nervous. Not so much about going there but if something were to happen while we are there (quarantines, things cancelling, schools shutting down). That would be a major bummer. My tickets are non-refundable and unless there is a state of emergency in UK, virgin probably won't refund my tickets. i also paid for my airbnb already. SIGH."
"Ayesha, I think the chances of anything major happening in the next week or so are highly unlikely. If you were coming in a month though, well, who knows.Over the last 2 weeks there's been an extra case here and there, but no mass outbreaks. It really would be overkill to be shutting tourist attractions and having mass quarantines with only 20 people in the UK affected."
"Tourism is already affected. Airlines like British Air, Lufthansa, United have cut flights, instituted hiring freezes, offered employees unpaid leaves and if you don’t “see” it does not mean it isn’t happening. I do not think you can make light of this and going forward it may not be business as usual."
I’m traveling in about 6 weeks and am also worried about the trip being disrupted due to containment measures. What does a quarantine look like if you’re stopped at the airport for instance? Where do you go? Who pays?
I think even with travel insurance you run the risk of a financial burden. One issue for us......if it becomes as widespread and transmissible as some think is it worth the risk to be away from home?
I haven't noticed any change at all but to be honest London is a very busy place I think there would have to be 1000+ less visitors to actually notice
"'so who really knows how many people going about their normal business in London or NYC are infected.' No one knows how many people around the world have contracted COVID-19, had a mild illness, and are now going about their business. As well no one knows whether any of those people will have passed on the virus.With a longish incubation period and mild respiratory symptoms in a number of people it really will be difficult to say that the disease in City A is the result of a traveller from City B. Incubation with influenza is about one to four days during which time a person might feel off colour and pass on the virus before the illness kicks in.I'd say the biggest concerns are that there aren't any effective antivirals, no vaccine as yet, and that this is an unknown pathogen which may turn right after indicating left.Those at risk - and it's not just the very young or very old - will have to decide their risk tolerance. I intend to travel next week but plan to ensure more than my usual hygiene standards for my own health and to avoid acting as a vector."
"“It really would be overkill to be shutting tourist attractions and having mass quarantines with only 20 people in the UK affected.”===============It’s only 12. 8 of the first 9 patients have recovered and been discharged. Indeed with 4 of those 12 active cases being from the Diamond Princess and under quarantine the moment they left Japan, you can argue there are only 8 “homegrown” active cases in the UK. Of course that could change and I suspect it will to some extent. How serious that “some extent” turns out to be is anyone’s guess."
"We are scheduled to arrive March 19th. A bit worried (not so much about Coronavirus as I beleive it can be transmitted anywhere) but more so about getting over there and being stuck or our Eurostar being canceled into France where our return flights depart. I am also wondering if we need to purchase a private medical insurance policy in order to be seen by a doctor if needed. We still plan to visit as the insurance policies are not allowing any coverage for a ""known or foreseen"" event. We have about 15 tours between London, France and Finland that are already paid. Just not sure what's going on at this point. Even if our flights reimbursed us, we are not likely to get the Eurostar, Thayls, Great Western Railway, etc trains and so forth reimbursed."
"I would pose these questions directly to your travel insurance company......they are all different in the coverage they offer; what they would cover; etc. The most worrisome thing is that it appears this is so fluid that situations can change in any country in a matter of days.... before you travel or during your stay. Also worrisome is that China, South Korea, Iran and now the US government have not been totally transparent or prepared."

"Every policy is different.....some will pay directly and some are only secondary insurers.

"Post 49 - yes, medical insurance is highly advisable.Only basic emergency medical care is free to visitors to the U.K. anything else is subject to charge - as is repatriation, which can get very expensive indeed."
"Going forward this may become a very unique situation as to what travel insurance will cover or even be able to cover. We have travel insurance for our September trip which includes medical insurance and repatriation. If the situation worsens how good will that coverage be? We do not have the more costly cancel for any reason policy so if we decide not to travel we would lose any items we already pre paid (air, theater tickets.) Our hotels are all booked with flexible, refundable rates.I would be very careful what you pay in advance........if you have already pre paid items and your trip is soon I would contact your travel insurer and find out what your coverage is and what your options are. Don’t assume just because you have a policy you are good to go.....be proactive."
"Adding to #55, consider what would happen if you need an extended stay eg because you or travel companion aren’t declared fit to fly or are in isolation for two or more weeks."
The Louvre closed until further notice. Is it only a matter of time before one of London's museums follow suit? https:/…29cc5b26f3620a2bbd6c8444f4f12e42
"Closing the Louvre to visitors sounds like an exercise in reducing the potential for transmission to staff than anything else.However, if staff leave their houses, use the Metro or walk through the streets of Paris the chances of meeting the virus are probably only slightly lower than when at the not really closed environment of the museum, although the number of people moving through it is substantial.Trying to maintain a cordon sanitaire when the population inside it has a mix of those who may have been in contact with the organism is rather an exercise in futility. Risk reduction attempts such as this can ramp up anxiety in the well population too."
"That’s what I was wondering too about attractions closingEdited: 3:42 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"I wonder that the reason of low number of positive cases in some countries, like UK, where the neighboring country has high numbers like Italy, is due to lack of testing. In US, only those symptomatic patients with explicit contact history with known locales or known positive cases have been tested, less than 500 tests have been done. New cases will certainly rise when more testings are carried out in the following weeks. Not trying to be alarmist, but I think there is a possibility of false negative due to lack of testing. I don't see how UK is substantially different from Italy, especially when the population are free to move about."
"Italy is not a neighbouring Country to the UK!Remember we are an Island, and even though we have left the EU, and were never part of the Schengen Zone anyway, there is no freedom of movement in the sense you are meaning!Of the 36 cases in the UK to date, virtually all of them have been linked with people contracting it whilst visiting another infected Country!"

"#63, ""all of the cases have visited infected countries"" - is this because only those cases have been tested? In US, this was the reason until couple days ago (and we didn't know about it until a couple days ago), is UK testing standard different from US?Edited: 9:35 pm, March 01, 2020 "
"If you are concerned then stay away. The virus, which seems to be little different to a normal flu virus, is in the US as well so choose your risk level & location. Consider other risks too - you are far less likely to be shot in London!! You say your aren't trying to be alarmist but that is exactly what you are being. Feeding the hysteria is not a good idea."
"On the other hand, choosing to ignore the fact is also not a good idea.Edited: 9:47 pm, March 01, 2020 "
I don’t know? What is the Standard? What is your Standard?We will find out tomorrow morning when the Prime Minister chairs a COBRA Meeting on the Subject!
"There is a difference between ignoring things and hysteria. I was in S E Asia in late Jan/Feb with thousnds of reported cases and none of the hysteria that has now attached itself to e.g. Italy, often borne of a complete lack of understanding of the location of outbreaks and the steps taken, nor of the actual rsk of catching COVID19. Many thousands more have died in the US from ordinary flu. People need to get some perspective."
"#68 - Corona virus infection is diagnosed by lab testing via swab a sample from the patient, In US, CDC's testing criteria included contact with people from known areas or contact with people with positive test result. So if a patient displayed all the symptoms but without explicit contact history he/she was simply not tested. Until a few days ago, a pneumonia patient without such contact history was finally tested because he was not responding to treatment and the result was positive. This is what is called community spread. Now CDC has changed its testing criteria to include all patients that display the symptoms, it is expected the number will rise significantly. We are still waiting for the production of testing kits to ramp up, so far US has tested 500 cases, South Korea 90,000 cases, China over a million.These are simply facts, all I want to point out is just because the current confirmed cases are low, doesn't mean the infection is low. I do know that Italy doesn't border UK, I mean that population is free to move, it is not logical that virus spread is only high in Italy. I agree with you that it is not good idea to be hysterical, neither is false sense of security."
"The symptoms are mild for most people, and deaths are miniscule compared to flu, I am simply pointing out low number may not be a true reflection of the virus spread."
"Our trip is not until September but if we were planning to visit in the next few weeks we would cancel.......that is our tolerance level, not necessarily everyone’s. Too many unknowns; the basic travel/medical insurance we bought months ago is probably useless; possibility of some venues being closed; better support and medical at home. We have had the basic flu and with meds and rest we were good to go in a few days..........this virus is quite different and we would not be comfortable being that far from home.......that’s us. We will see how things look in a few months and decide."
“Too many unknowns; the basic travel/medical insurance we bought months ago is probably useless”It’s good that you’ve identified that now rather than too late. It gives you time to find appropriate travel insurance for future trips. IMO that is essential regardless of the current Coronavirus issue. “better support and medical at home”Hopefully you’d have the support of family and friends if you catch the virus at home in the US. I assume you mean you have insurance which covers medical care at home rather than that medical care itself is better!
"I'm in Austria and we share border with (North) Italy.We have 14 cases, 13 cases people who recently travelled to North Italy or related to them.Edited: 2:30 am, March 02, 2020 "
"The latest declared testing figures I can find are from 26/2. The U.K. number was 7000+, USA 445, Italy 9000+ I believe the NHS is offering ‘drive through’ testing for those who may have been at risk."
"Current figures (taken from Gov.uk website)As of 01 March at 9am, a total of 11,750 people have been tested in the UK, of which 11,715 were confirmed negative and 35 positive."
"How much this virus spreads and how much travel is affected is somewhat unknown. One thing travelers could be aware of is what existing or new travel insurance policies cover and what they do not. Many travelers have pre purchased accommodations, inter city travel, theater and site tickets in addition to their air fare. This recent article may help those who are planning to purchase travel insurance for upcoming trips as well as those who already have a policy. https:/…I am not advocating changing your travel plans.....I am only suggesting you are proactive in knowing what you are covered for; what expenses you might not want to pre pay; what your options are."
"#77 thank you!! I am traveling domestically in the US for business trip and I saw a few people wearing masks (less than 10) in the entire airport. Either, they are afraid of getting infected or they are one of those who have been to the countries with high cases and they are trying to save other people, just in case they have it but a mild case, which is scary. Closing of attractions is what I am afraid of. I don’t want to go if attractions are closed. Taking chance of getting sick and delay in returning back to the US is crazy but it is ok as long as I can still enjoy my vacation as I have hoped for. People around me think I should cancel my trip (end of March) but I still haven’t given up yet."
"I do not know your particular circumstances as to what you have pre paid but currently as things stand you would not be entitled to any refunds if you cancelled only because the virus exists. Will things change in three weeks? Who knows. If things remain status quo you would most likely be just as safe in London as at home. Wash your hands often.....stay away from anyone coughing......maybe tweak your itinerary if you were planning to attend crowded venues. Doctors agree that masks do little. Knowing what your travel insurance will or will not cover is smart to find out before you leave. If some of your reservations can be cancelled without penalty, reviews d know the terms.I’m sure the many London TA members will have specific suggestions.....have a fantastic trip."
"Angela, I leave this Friday and I am leaning towards cancelling. Not 100% sure yet though - a part of me still really wants to go but like you said, I don't wanna get there and find out attractions are shut down (we are there for 10 days so things can change rapidly even while we are there). Also the possibility of being quarantined makes me nervous. Does anyone know what happens exactly if one of us get sick while in London and go to the hospital - would we be stuck in a hospital for 14 days? What happens if one of us has a fever at the airport when we are leaving London? I am trying to find out these details hopefully one of you knows ;) TIA.Edited: 11:27 am, March 02, 2020 "
"As I mentioned before, everyone has a different tolerance. You have to prepare for the worse case scenario. Can you cancel anything today w/o losing money? Do you have travel insurance including medical and what does it cover and what does it not cover? Chances are your trip will be fine but why not gather all the facts TODAY and know what your risks will be and how much £ you forfeit if you cancel.......I would not wait to map out all of your facts and then decide."
"We are in the same boat as you.. supposed to leave thursday night on a red eye, and not sure what the right answer is. We also have many people telling us not to travel, and a small amount telling us to travel. Like you, not terrified of becoming ill, but the logistics of being potentially getting quarantined somewhere."
"Ayesha , I sympathise with your indecision and I agree with Martyap about making sure you have all the information you need.All anyone here can tell you is the situation as it currently is, no one knows what will happen in the next few days, let alone weeks. At the moment we seem to have a fairly low level of confirmed cases relative to the number of tests carried out. It certainly doesn’t seem that London is currently a hot spot for the virus but that also might change."
">>Does anyone know what happens exactly if one of us get sick while in London and go to the hospital - would we be stuck in a hospital for 14 days?<<Ayesha – You would only been quarantined if you tested positive for coronavirus, in which case I imagine you'd have to stay in hospital for treatment anyway. They aren't just putting people in quarantine who just happen to have a fever caused by a cold or something similar. There's no way the system could cope with those numbers for a start.Edited: 11:50 am, March 02, 2020 "
Spoke to airlines and hotel. They said I cannot be refunded :( I guess we are going for now unless something drastic happens.
"With an incubation period of about 14 days there may be people planning to travel in the next week who have been in contact with COVID-19 who are unaware of it. A percentage of those who've been in contact with the virus will have few to no symptoms although those with certain risk factors may feel more unwell. It would be difficult to impossible at this time to determine who has been in contact with the virus when showing few to no symptoms.'What happens if one of us has a fever at the airport when we are leaving London?' That would depend on whether you had other symptoms as fever on its own means little. I've got friends still in clinical practice. One - an A&E doc - is on holiday in the Caribbean right now. When I asked both if they'd travel this week the answer was an unequivocal yes from both.I plan to travel in the very near future, but others must decide for themselves."
"As mentioned upthread, I have an upcoming business trip to London. I would have little hesitation going (and am in fact flying to San Diego for work this week from NJ, about the same distance of flight...) other than the fact I have a 2 week vacation planned back in the US. Things can change rapidly during the course of 7 days, and I don't want to find myself on the wrong side of the Atlantic when I should be in Key West!One point I will make is I did catch the H1N1 virus back in the Fall of 2009 and it was one of the worst bouts of flu I have ever had. I had not missed a day of work in years and that flu took me almost a week to fully recover. When I think that I was 11 years younger back then, it does give me some pause for thought!"
"I know so many are concerned. We are traveling to London on 4/22 london to Portugal for 3 weeks. Most of our hotels are cancellable, but not airfare which is pricey. At this point, we are not cancelling anything and just watching. Up until today, portugal did not have any confirmed cases, but....2 reported. Sounds like you are going so I hope you have an enjoyable trip!!! Part of me thinks if they dont stop travel to where I am going, maybe less people!!!"
"We're supposed to leave for London next week via Virgin Atlantic. At this point we still plan on making the trip. But, with today's news of British Airways canceling a bunch of flights including from JFK in New York, I'm getting more concerned about getting stuck there and not being able to get home on our booked flight than I am about contracting coronavirus.Things are changing fast so we might have to make our final decision on the day."
"We have a trip to the UK during the Spring Break (early April).I think the virus is going to make its rounds everywhere - that ship has sailed. But my fear is getting stuck in Edinburgh or London because of it, or going there and having to stay indoors the whole time. Or landing and being told we can't get in.I'm from Seattle where the first 6 deaths happened and who knows what's going to happen next several weeks.So I'm really considering canceling everything. I have two weeks to decide.In the end, my heart goes out to all the people that died.@jtwiz My wife got the H1N1 too and she doesn't remember that week very well...Edited: 4:59 pm, March 02, 2020 "
British Air and Ryanair have cancelled hundreds of flights due to reduced demand........tough call if you are traveling in the next few weeks

"Regarding US-UK flights, according to this site...https://www.businessinsider.com/british-airw…...BA is only canceling a total of 24 flights between JFK and London in the month of March. That's just a small percentage of its flights. It makes sense that they'd need to cut *some* due to decrease in demand. Will just have to wait and see how it unfolds. Fortunately I'm flying into Manchester. ;) My trip isn't until July/Aug though; things could change greatly before then.Edited: 5:36 pm, March 02, 2020 "
I just saw online that Delta allows change of flight without fee for international flight with travel date March 1 2020 and later. However it must be rebooked within 1 year.
"Please correct me if I'm mistaken, but that will not affect any of us.""Eligibility only for customers with an Original Ticket Issue Date between March 1, 2020 and March 31, 2020."""
"American and Delta are waiving the change fee, but only for new bookings (Mar 1-16 for American, Delta for Mar 1-30), this appears to be an effort to drum up the demand for future travel rather than relieving the concern/stress of the virus of the current ticket holders."
My flight to London is on April 26th and I am still waiting. Will cancel only in case of Level 3 alert
"I am high risk (age and medical conditions) . I've been to London and Winchester recently and am still planning to travel within the uk. Testing here now includes people presenting with anything that might be coronavirus in at least some locations, not sure if that covered all the uk. There have been over 10,000 tests and only 40 positive and almost all those picked it up from abroad or close contact with people from abroad there is one where they havent traced the source yet. So at the moment it's contained. That could change rapidly - but it could also change rapidly at home. Few people here are going into panic mode yet but bring your own hand sanitiser as that is selling out If you got sick while here you'd phone NHS 111 - do not go to hospital unless instructed to do so or seriously ill when you call 999 for an ambulance and say you have breathing difficulties.If you come get disinfectant wipes and wipe the trays seat buckles and window shades on your flight Wash hands often (2 choruses of happy birthday) https:/…coronavirus-watch-how-germs-spreadand disinfect your phone as most have more germs than the owner's toilet.Edited: 5:07 am, March 03, 2020 "
"DaytonJG, you are right! I misread it...hopefully Delta will extend its offer to customers booking prior to March 1 too if the risk level is higher for London. I checked WB HP studio and they allow change of date for £10 (per ticket I think). I hope all other attractions with advance purchased tickets will allow change of date if they close. The train tickets probably not much hope for change.Edited: 6:38 am, March 03, 2020 "
“”and disinfect your phone as most have more germs than the owner's toilet.””So true! I always do that even when I am not traveling.
"This is such a personal decision. I was in hospital quarantine for five days with H3N2 in 2015 and had to cancel a trip to London last minute. But I was at home and not travelling. I am in a vulnerable age group and have enough underlying conditions that I would cancel any upcoming trip anywhere. But that is my particular case. So you need to consider your age and general health, read the T&Cs of your travel/health insurance, and calculate your risk comfort zone. If I were younger and healthier then I would go because I think the risk is still low."
"AyeshaU, Confuso, and those having trip to London planned in March or April, please give us update what you end up with (going or not going). If you go I hope you will enjoy your trip without interruption or illness and that you will be able to come back as planned. I am gonna wait and see till the week before my trip to make a decision."
"Dancingmolly, you are a wise woman. What a kind, thoughtful and correct response! Thank you!Nora"
BA tickets for 4/8 to 4/15.20th anniversary. We will keep reviewing stats.
So the government announced today plans if the outbreak escalates here in the UK if you check out the BBC news you ll be able to get details. At the moment apart from a lack of hand sanitiser in shops you wouldn’t know any difference in London. I went in yesterday by train to work. Walked along south bank to the office and later took the tube to different office. I didn’t see one single person wearing a face mask. Now things can change and decision to travel anywhere should be based on your own circumstances.
"I think you would be insane to plan a trip to London at the moment. Other UK cities would be bad enough, but London is a special case. Imagine just one infected person arriving at Heathrow and taking the tube into central London, to their hotel and then going sightseeing? All the things they will touch? The passports they hand over for checking at immigration, ticket machines, escalator handrails, taxi door handles, shop door handles, menus, seats in the London Eye, beer glasses, ATM screens, credit card machines, cutlery, wrapped sandwiches in Tesco express, trying on clothes in Oxford Street, grab handles on sightseeing buses, the towels and linen in their hotel that the chamber maid picks up, the menu touchscreens at McDonalds, trays in restaurants,Beefeater dolls in souvenir shops, ticket barriers when they touch their Oyster card to it.The list goes on!"
"“”lack of hand sanitiser in shops””That’s actually a great thing: means that people are taking the threat seriously. I am counting days to my trip and hope for the best. Although I did stop prebooking attractions at this point and have only one theater and one opera tickets purchased. Thank you, familytraveller155!"
"karmen - Flights booked (back in November) for end of July/early August for 50th Bday. We’re also taking a wait and see approach. If we cxl, $ for flights lost."
Angela - we decided to forge ahead with our trip to London this Friday. Now back to packing! =D
"Please update us on your trip. We’re scheduled to travel to London April 1 and are nervous for all the reasons mentioned here. Safe travels!Edited: 11:58 am, March 03, 2020 "
"AyeshaU, I think your chance of enjoying your vacation next week is better than mine (4 weeks from now) because by then the virus would have been more widely spread and attractions maybe closed, quarantine is more likely to happen 3-4 weeks from now. Enjoy your trip!!"
"We are leaving for London tomorrow from the US, and thanks to this forum and input from everyone, have decided to go ahead with the trip. From the answers on my post about the same topic seems like things are almost normal in London.Will surely post after we get back to give an update.Edited: 1:25 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"We are leaving for London and Portugal on Sunday. We’ve considered canceling, but at this point, we are planning to forge ahead. We have planned this spring break trip with our 2 grandchildren for over a year. I’ve been lurking on this forum thread and really appreciate all of your comments. Best of luck to everyone."
"I will keep monitoring the situation in London and Edinburgh and will travel if things don't get worse.Things are not looking good though. UK is now at level 4 incident which is the highest.Meanwhile, I'm sure Seattle cases are going to skyrocket because, well, we were not testing before, and we're still not testing a lot of people. In two weeks we'll probably be like Italy, I think."
"Personally, I cannot find anywhere that UK is now at level 4. Maybe poster #119 can provide some more information - where exactly was it posted?Edited: 5:39 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"#120 - Here's an article about Level 4. I think it's good that the UK is being proactive about this and putting the infrastructure in place that they may need for containment. I doubt it'll reach N. Italy proportions, but it was still a smart move imo.https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news…Edited: 5:48 pm, March 03, 2020 "
The level 4 that you mention in 119 is an internal NHS grading given to allow more central control of activity and resources. It allows the service to plan more effectively for potential problems. According to the HSJ the decision was taken several weeks ago and announced today.
"Now it is clear, thank you both!So it is clearly not the same as CDC Alert Level 4, which has not been issued for the UK. Even for Italy, CDC Level 4 has been issued for Lombardy and Veneto only so far.Actually, I applaud the NHS Level 4 Alert: it shows how seriously the virus threat is being treated in the UK. Thank you very much!NoraEdited: 6:12 pm, March 03, 2020 "
"I am reminded of the old adage 'if you can keep your head when all around are losing theirs, you probably do not understand the seriousness of the situation.'There was an 'expert' on BBC Radio 4 this morning who estimates the real figure for the number of infections in Italy is between 50,000 - 100,000 cases. The vast majority of those are trivial and many don't even realise they have the virus. Unfortunately that is NOT a good thing as many of those will go on to infect others who WILL become seriously ill. The general consensus seems to be that the UK is 2-3 weeks behind Italy. That is why there are all these reports here of the 'life is going as normal'. The problem is that what is happening in the background is far from normal. The first 40 or so cases were all people who had been to infected areas. now we are seeing infections in people with no obvious link to previuos cases. I think if you come to the London within the next 7-10 days you will likely have a perfectly normal holiday. I think it is also likely you will catch coronavirus and take it home with you."
"The outbreak in Italy stayed in single figures for almost three weeks, then within less than a week the cases jumped to over 1000. Likewise in the UK, the number of infections stayed below ten for 25 days, then last week it jumped to over 20 and as of today it is 53. This seems to be the pattern, a 3-4 week period of single figure infections then a sudden increase in weeks 5,6 & 7. The problem is the long incubation period and the fact the virus stays active on some surfaces for up to a week. There could be thousands of people in London infected and currently infecting others.If the number of infections stays in double figures for the next couple of weeks it will be a good sign. If it gets to three figures by the weekend then things are looking bad!"
"And at the Press Conference yesterday, one of the two Top Experts standing either side of the Prime Minister, said that one in a Hundred who contract it could die, however he tempered that by turning it around and saying 99 would live!Let’s wait and see!And another thing, trawling through the Dozen or so of today’s Front Pages (courtesy of the BBC News App, personally haven’t bought a Paper for years) I see nothing but sensationalism designed to sell papers!Edited: 6:20 am, March 04, 2020 "
"I have followed the posts on this forum as we have a trip planned for September. I agree with #125 poster and that seems to be true in the USA as well. Since testing is limited and many who get the virus either don’t know they have it or self treat their symptoms the number of reported cases are false positives.Will venues close......probably yes? Do you run a greater risk on a vacation trip......going to theaters, using public transportation more, waiting in lines......possibly? My main concern (70 years old, good health) is that if I were to become infected I would rather be at home than thousands of miles away. That is me. Everyone must decide on their own. I agree that in the weeks to come the number of infected cases will increase and business as usual.....in many countries, will be altered.Edited: 6:28 am, March 04, 2020 "
"To get back to the OP's original question. I was chatting yesterday with a friend who works in tourism, and she said they've noticed a definite downturn in far ahead advanced bookings. She said they're still getting people joining their tours, but the trend has moved to booking only a day or so in advance and usually it would be at least a few weeks."
"Poster 116 & 117 please update us on your trip. We leave for London in 14 days on March 18th. At this point we’re forging ahead as our insurance does not provide cancel for any reason. I’m mostly worried about attractions and being quarantined or stuck as our return flight is out of Paris. We are arriving into Heathrow, staying for a week, then taking the Eurostar to a Paris for a week and then leaving from CDG. But as each of these areas are not showing level alerts, AA is not assisting g or offering any changes without s tremendous fee. Please let us know how things are shaping up. Thanks!!!"
"I think you will know what the situation is like within about 7 days. If the number of new infections stays per day stays in single figures I doubt there will be much disruption.But if the infections seriously escalate then there are plans to stop public gatherings and limit public transport. I cannot see either British or French governments allowing Eurostar to carry on as normal. Especially the British government, considering the general xenophobic atmosphere in the country anyway,"
"Oh Lord, you must be watching and listening to the media and feeling your blood pressure raise by the second.The media (and BBC in particular - the bloody virus was about 80% of the Today programme this morning, then at 9am, a virus special with Nick Robinson) is in utter hysterics and it's absurd. Everyone should get a grip. Every year thousands of people in London catch the standard flu virus. Many don't even realise. Many get a bit of a cold/fever. Some vulnerable folk die. Do we close events? Shut down public transport? Tell tourists not to come?I live in London, and though as a diabetic am apparently more vulnerable, will be out and about this weekend on the Tube as I am every weekend. It is good that the government is making preparations (though the only good thing they're doing!), but everyone acting as though we're already in a crisis is just madness. KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON!"
"The pandemic is in the media. I was in Costco yesterday and people were buying (whatever was left)....toilet paper, water, tissues, paper towels and cleaningsupplies as if we were being invaded. I agree about using common sense and going about your business. My concern is that I’d rather deal with the hysteria at home than across the pond on “vacation.”"
">>The pandemic is in the media.<<That's the ""infodemic""..."
I think I would rather be quarantined on my chosen Greek island for an extra two weeks as opposed to being stuck at home in my flat!. I will still be going on my holiday in June as long as the flight will take me. !!
"The “infodemic” is on the TA Rome forum as well, Ariel. Self-appointed moderators are having sleepless nights updating TA readers with the information easily available online and making their own judgements, projections and recommendations. Kudos to the London forum contributors for being so reasonable and respectful!Edited: 11:37 am, March 04, 2020 "
"Our trip is in middle of May to UK. I appreciate the thoughtful posts from those of you who live there. We plan on using public transport and staying in VRBO - Bath, London, York and Edinburgh. So far we plan to continue as planned."
"Circulation in the papers and media watching is way down in the USA. There are many who appear to be using this virus for personal gain. We see it over and over here with weather events, mass shootings and with the narrative used being only the part that furthers their personal agendas. Hope TA doesn’t think I have over stepped the line on posting this. I rely on TA for all my travel planning and value the input from individual contributors."
"Armrest Dominance, I stopped making advanced booking too. At this point I only booked WB HP studio, Parliament tour, and Heathrow Express. I decided to just wait and see till it is closer to my travel dates. Good thing London has a lot of free museums so if no tickets are available to other attractions while we are in London then we just gonna go to the free museums. If we can still go (end of March.)Edited: 12:50 pm, March 04, 2020 "
I wondered if there would be panic on here when a big gathering cancelled the show.The reason they cancelled/postponed it was because a number of the participants couldn't fly here because of flight restrictions by their countries. It was multicultural and couldn't continue with only half the contributors. So far the only one.The major sights will be open as long as we don't get massive loss of staff due to illness as they are residents or the thing doesn't rage into something massive. And that's an unknown. We are all in the same boat there.
"So far the growth in the number of cases has been almost entirely people who brought it back from trips abroad. As long as the increase doesnt include lots of people who picked up the virus in this country your chance of acquiring the virus here is low. There is still some scaremongering on this thread.We dont yet know exactly how long the virus survives outside the body. To quote a bit of science instead of hysteria "" depending on the material and the conditions, human coronaviruses can remain infectious from 2 hours to 9 days.At temperatures of around 4°C or 39.2oF, certain versions of the coronavirus could remain viable for up to 28 days. At temperatures of 30–40°C (86–104°F), coronaviruses tended to persist for a shorter time. ""Important to note that the shorter survival times are on metal surfaces - like the rails on the tube. So to be infected you have to grab that rail after an infected person has done so and before someone else has touched it. You then have to touch your mouth, nose or eyes before you wash or sanitise your hands.When there is evidence - in the form of large increases in cases who contracted the virus in this country - or the virus being widespread in the environment I'll be more concerned. We are not there yet.We are beginning to see large events with a lot of international participants being cancelled."
"I just checked Delta website and it looks like Delta is now offering fee waiver for international flights booked on or before March 1 Impacted Travel Dates are March 1-March 31. New tickets must be re-issued on or before May 31, 2020Rebooked Travel must begin no later than May 31.Not a lot of flexibility but better than nothing for those who want to reschedule their trip.I hope I read this right, cancellation is not in the offer, only rescheduling is allowed for fee waiver.Edited: 4:13 pm, March 04, 2020 "
"Thanks Angela. I'm scheduled to leave 03/27, and as of now still plan to go. Delta's new policy assumes things will be hunky-dory by 05/31, and they know most families can't just adjust their vacation when school is still in session."
"On the radio yesterday, LBC someone rang in from a bus company that do tours around London. He has just lost his job with a few others as the number of tourists has decreased already. I know it’s not peak season yet. One thought is though once it’s becomes wide spread, it won’t matter travel as you then could catch it anywhere, as long as the place you go has a good health care system."
for those of you with booked flights soon - my take on this is that you are a lot safer coming soon than in May. We are still in the containment phase but it's increasingly unlikely this can be contained and if it cant May could be peak epidemic. However by then there will probably be epidemics in most of the world.
“”but it's increasingly unlikely this can be contained””This is an assumption and not the fact at this point.
This is an assumption and not the fact at this point.———————————————It’s pretty much the message that the Chief Medical Officer has been giving in various interviews today.

"I agree that if you are choosing going now vs. going in May, now maybe a better choice. Most of the travelers' concerns are not catching the virus, but for logistics, like attraction closing, public events cancelled, or flight canceled, etc. Since the cases are low in UK currently (even if it may not truly represent low virus spread), the above measure are unlike to happen. It will take some times for the case to ramp up, so right now maybe the window of time to go.Edited: 2:17 am, March 05, 2020 "

"A form of collective insanity if you ask me.————————————————-I’d only ask you if I knew that you were an epedemiologist.“Since the outbreak of Coronavirus, far more people have died from Influenza, yet nothing is ever said about that.”———————-Not true, although that seems to have become a mantra in the last few weeks. In addition everyone in the UK who might be at risk is offered free annual immunisation. Those of us who don’t qualify can have it done at a pharmacy for a modest amount of money. So plenty is said about it."
"The difference is that the mortality rate for flu is about 0.1%, yesterday it was announce that for CV it is now about 3-4%. It is also different from flu in that it seems to stay alive on surfaces for much longer."
I think it is significant that yesterday we had the biggest daily increase in infections and the government decided to stop giving daily reports on infection rates!
"#155 of 155 “I think it is significant that yesterday we had the biggest daily increase in infections and the government decided to stop giving daily reports on infection rates!“The fact is that this virus is spreading rapidly and drastic measures will be taken in many countries. The OP and others on this forum are trying to determine if travel to the UK is safe. It is probably as “safe” as where you live. Look at the thousands of passengers on the Grand Princess now in limbo off the coast of California......how many are now infected? How many were infected during their several weeks of traveling on back to back cruises to Mexico and then Hawaii?How many disembarked the ship after the first cruise, boarded planes and innocently went about their business spreading the virus even more?No matter how you spin this, traveling away from home is risky. You are leaving your comfort zone, your support system and access to your medical coverage. Will sites close during your vacation? Will venues like theater shows cancel performances? Will you be quarantined at your expense? No one knows but as this virus spreads these are certainly possibilities and as the OP asked........there is no way to determine how much tourism will be affected but it will be affected.Sorry for being so gloomy but I really feel that this is not to be taken likely. Chances are travelers will continue with their plans and have a great time but there are risks involved that should be considered. Decisions are made daily based on the spread.Edited: 5:38 am, March 05, 2020 "
"All life is a risk and sometimes travel away from home is safer than staying at home. I've visited South Africa a few times and I consider it safer for white South Africans in London than in Johannesburg. I dont have to avoid roads with slow traffic here for fear of being highjacked, I dont need a private security firm on speed dial.There is scaremongering still on this thread. As I've pointed out before the virus doesnt live for long on metal surfaces. It can be made harmless by soap and hot water, by 70% alcohol, by various disinfectants, by UV light. Infections in the uk are still almost all acquired abroad. The average person with the virus will give it to few others, because it is not transmitted as easily as the mass hysteria might suggest. Other infections, like flu and norovirus, may actually be LESS prevalent this year precisely because people are taking seriously advice about hand washing.We are still in containment mode, so only a few cancellations of events involving a lot of international participants. However the mass hysteria may mean that attractions are a bit less crowded and prices are a bit better. Now is a good time to visit."
This is not scaremongering. The lack of transparency and not taking this virus seriously is a mistake and washing your hands and going about your business sounds better than it is. Each traveler must determine his or her tolerance level.
UK is no longer in containment stage. From BBC: Coronavirus: UK moving towards 'delay' phase of virus plan as cases hit 115 (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51749352). There are cases of community spread.

"Noraact, thank you! Yes I have been watching the price of the hotels as well. Today is the first time I saw significant drop so I cancelled my reservation and rebooked too (I haven’t given up!!!!) I think it will probably drop some more by the end of March. It’s demand and supply market so now is a good time to go actually, less tourists (at least there must be a lot less tourists from Asia), cheap hotels, etc....as long as attractions stay open and do business as usual and the fear of being quarantined is less than the excitement ones have hoped for. Though, I recently have another fear of “alienated” upon my return from London should anything happens like Italy; however, we are still going at this point because Delta offer to reschedule the international flight is limit to traveling by May 31 which is not doable for us.Edited: 1:32 pm, March 05, 2020 "
"Same here, Angela! I am still going on April 26th, unless something very significant and unfortunate happens (for me, Level 3 Alert from CDC is significant). My airline ticket is on points, so... oh, well, the worst case is that I will lose them, but I am sure Chase Manhattan will offer me something (I am a life long customer and have Chase Sapphire). So let’s hope for the best!"
"Hi all! I'm scheduled to go on May 31st and I'm also taking a wait-and-see approach. I really don't want to cancel, but I figure by then hopefully either things will be improved (I know it's a long shot but I'm hoping that this is like the flu and diminishes in warm weather), or it will be a semi-equal chance of catching the virus here at home. I figure I'll wait until early May to see what the situation is - both in London itself and whether traveling by plane is safe, and then make my decision. I appreciate everyone's insights. I haven't been to London in 3 years and I miss it!"
"I am not an alarmist but it appears that this virus may be here for many months. Each day more community based cases are confirmed all over the USA. Our trip to London and Edinburgh is not until late September and the only thing we prepaid was air. I would be very cautious what you prepay that is not refundable; see what your travel insurance covers. All we can do is wait and see how this virus spreads. We all have different criteria, circumstances and risk tolerance so whether to travel will be very personal decisions. Whatever you decide.....travel safe"
"Excellent, Ariel! I am not planning to cancel (and I am way older than you) and will be anxiously waiting for your trip report. Fingers crossed!"
"martyap - I was about to pay for airfare for a late sept trip, but held off. If H1N1 is any guidance, it subsided around july/aug 2009, then the 2nd wave started around spet/oct, then vaccine became available in nov. So maybe sept will be a narrow window."
"The way things look it might not be necessary to purchase air now to get a better price. Everyone has different circumstances and risk tolerance. Everyone has different obligations at home. Everyone has varying health conditions. If things get worse we would have difficulty going on a vacation and having a good time. That’s us. It has nothing to do with what might or might not be....just pure facts. If we lose a few $$, so be it.Note: I believe Airbnb just came out with some new cancellation policies re:this virus"
"Meanwhile those of us who live near London are still buying ballet, opera, theatre and Wimbledon tickets for the upcoming months."
"Latest advice from our chief medical officer “One of the things that is clear if you model the epidemic,” says the chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, “is that we will get 50 per cent of all the cases over a three-week period – and 95 per cent of the cases over a nine-week period, if it follows the trajectory we think it is likely to.”The problem, of course is - which 3 week period? We are now moving out of the containment period with 25 new cases in London yesterday and into the delay phase - trying to reduce the peak of the infection and spread it over a longer time period. We need a heatwave.This is likely to spread faster in America where those with an infection may be less able to afford to stay home."
"#170 ""Meanwhile those of us who live near London are still buying ballet, opera, theatre and Wimbledon tickets for the upcoming months.""Buying theater tickets and spending thousands of pounds for a trip are quite different. All I am saying is that this is very fluid and governments both in the UK and USA can change policy at any moment. As the World Health Organization calls it, ""This is not a drill."" I hope this disappears tomorrow but travelers should realize that trips in the next few weeks and months might be disrupted.....no one knows how much and you certainly cannot pinpoint how you might me affected during your travels. I am only suggesting you know all your options both medically and financially BEFORE you travel.Edited: 7:44 am, March 06, 2020 "

I've seen some posts (on different forums) where someone has decided to cancel just assuming they get refunded for everything and then be shocked to find out they don't. If the destination isn't a high risk area then the costs are likely to come out of your own pocket.I would cancel if things changed and my government (and the WHO) regarded the UK as an ""epidemic area"" - don't know if that's the correct term, that's what they say here about continental China, Iran, South Korea and Italy - and if I lose my money so be it. But as of now I'm continuing my planning and staying optimistic."
"If you decide to cancel your trip, CONTACT all places that you made prepaid advanced reservations regardless of what the written policy about change or cancellation said. Some places have allowed cancellation with full refund or change of date without a fee during this uncertainty. If they don’t allow today or this week doesn’t mean they won’t allow it next week or month, don’t give up. If you decide to go, enjoy your trip, wash hands often, bring hand sanitizer, don’t touch your face, and come back with your trip report to give us hope."
"I have just read that Italy overall has seen a 90% drop in visitors and airlines are cancelling flights due to lack of demand. Sicily alone has seen an 80% drop in bookings and that is about as far from the centre of the outbreak as possible. So when the number of infections in the UK get into four figures we are bound to see the same thing here. At the moment London has the largest number of cases in the UK. Still only double figures, but I wouldn't go near London at the moment."
Just read that two British airways baggage handlers have tested positive! I wonder how many bags they have handled since they became infected?
"The figures for London are tiny compared to people here with TB and the regular flu. I travel by tube every day because I have to. I went to a concert at the massive 02 venue last night . I cant live my life hibernating in fear in my house else I would die of anxiety, stress and depression instead!! Spreading fear and paranoia helps nobody. Just be careful and keep washing your hands. We have to live life!!!Edited: 10:12 am, March 06, 2020 "
"“”Just read that two British airways baggage handlers have tested positive! I wonder how many bags they have handled since they became infected?””So what??? In no shape or form it means that every bag owner will become deadly ill. It depends a great deal on the age, immune system and overall health of a person. Some people really enjoy living in fear rather than thinking logically about the whole situation. Desinyy, thank you for your post! Way to go, in my opinion.Edited: 10:21 am, March 06, 2020 "
"David, I think the virus has impacted on tourism all over the world. I saw online that San Francisco Chinatown is a ghost town. Chinese people around the world have a big hit on their business (restaurants, etc). People are being very cautious and soon some won’t go out to eat regardless of what restaurant it is because who knows if the chefs are infected and touch the food, sneeze or cough into the food. But like Destinyy said, we have life to live so each one of us must know how much risk we can handle and act accordingly."
"Yesterday we had a meal from our local Chinese takeaway. It's not something we do often but we thought we ought to support their business. Instead of the constant scaremongering from yorkshire lets have some more facts - from the World Health Organisation, about contact tracing of the infected in China "" Between 1% and5% of contacts were subsequently laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19,"" These are family contacts of people confirmed to have Covid-19 and the vast majority STILL dont contract the infection. But if you want to panic over a bag just wash your hands after you handle it, then stick it next to a radiator for a time. We dont know yet how much effect heat has but it wont survive long on a bag anyway. To quote the DC this time "" COVID-19 has a generally poor survivability on surfaces and poses a low risk of spread from one person to another through contact of a shared surface"""
"We are basically doing what you suggest on Long Island, New York......going about our business. We ate lunch out today, went to the mall, Costco and my wife is currently having a manicure at a salon owned by a Chinese couple. It is easy at home and if you should get ill you go to your own doctor, your own hospital, using your own medical insurance and if you are quarantined you do so in your own home.Traveling, especially internationally “ might” involve a different set of issues......venues might close; trains or planes might suspend service.....and if you become ill your medical travel insurance might be worthless. And suppose you do contract this virus and told to self quarantine......where????? at whose expense? what about your traveling companions? who pays for the changed international flight home?We are trying our best to support local businesses at home as much as possible and agree that the hype and hysteria is not useful. We also agree that the risk is low and common sense precautions will most likely keep you safe and healthy to enjoy your trip. Knowing your options, liabilities, insurance, etc is very important at this time."
"Hello everyone We were set to leave this Sunday with our two grandkids. I have been so worried about taking them and either scaring them to death with all the hand sanitizer, etc., or them being quarantined and missing school for two to four weeks. If it was just my husband and I, there would be no question. Today we finally decided to cancel. We were able to rebook a trip to Fiji on the exact same dates. So, thank you everyone for your kind remarks and thoughts. I hope all of you who get to go enjoy your trip!"
"This is a very informative thread. Leaving for London and Paris next week. Flight, Euro star and hotels booked since December. Travel insurance purchased but seems pointless. We are getting mixed reviews as well on whether to travel. As a provider I am only concerned about being quarantined or stuck for any reason. I also feel it is inevitable that I will contract this virus from my hospital or office but at least I will be home. This is very hard...Edited: 10:33 pm, March 06, 2020 "
"Very personal decision.......watching the 20/20 special right now. This seems like it will change and not for the better every day. My point, if I were going to get this virus I would be better off at home than somewhere across the Atlantic. Planes and ships and the underground are Petri dishes under the best circumstances.....good luck with your decision and stay safe.Edited: 10:57 pm, March 06, 2020 "

We were able to rebook a trip to Fiji on the exact same dates.————————-Lacy20, we must all make the decisions that feel best for ourselves and our family BUT you do realise that the hand hygiene guidance doesn’t just apply to London or Europe? You must teach your grandchildren this whether you are staying at home in Arizona, travelling to London or visiting Fiji. It’s guidance for everyone, everywhere."
"What brittraveller said. People must keep up good hand hygiene EVERYWHERE. Lacy, this concerns you and your family at home too and you are not excluded from it by not travelling to Europe."
"Very much agree with the previous couple of posters. It doesn't matter if you stay home, go o Europe or somewhere else, you still need to practice good hand hygiene and help to protect yourselves.Personally, I think that it's good for children to learn about viruses and how to minimise risk."
"It. Er tai ly seems to still be busy. 2 weeks ago I was trying to book a restaurant for my upcoming birthday weekend I. 2 weeks time and I was on my 6th or 7th choice before I could get a reservation at lunch or dinner on the Friday or Saturday. I appreciate that’s more likely due to locals booking but folk are clearly still going out and about, getting on with their lives.Was out for lunch with my sister in Edinburgh yesterday, The restaurant was absolutely packed and if we hadn’t had a reservation, we would not have got in. Went to a gin place afterwards and also bursting at the seams. We were able to get a table that was being held for people coming for dinner at 7.30 as long as we moved on before then. On.y difference I noticed was in the bathrooms where folk were taking more time washing their hands."
In London now for a short trip. Took Thames River cruise and they cancelled several sailings for lack of demand and our boat was 1/4 full. It never gets full in winter but still. Very few Far Eastern visitors.
"#183- Same here. Set to leave in about 9 days with a week on London and Eurostar over to Paris for a week with our return flights leaving from CDG There are 6 of us including the kids. Much of our trip was pre paid (train tix to Paris, Thayls tickets to Belgium and Great Western tix to Bath),American Airlines is not negotiable at all on allowing us to postpone with an $1750 change fee for the 6 tickets so we’re set to continue at this point. Please post an update on your experience. Stocked on hand sanitizer and been taking additional vitamin c per my docs suggestion. Would love to know more about any restrictions happening though if any are at this point. We’re actually still pretty excited, but nervous of course as we don’t want to end up quarantined in any way. Thanks!"
"I'm also set to leave for London March 20th with my three children, ages 15, 12, and 9, and on to Paris via Eurostar for Spring Break. Everything pre-booked and impossible to get out of as of yet, so I really hate to cancel. Mostly concerned about quarantine and them missing school. As of now, we have not canceled anything. We are practicing good hygiene and have plenty of sanitizer, vitamins and supplies, both for here and our trip. The kids have also heard so many rumors at school that they are worried about this trip, too. So hard!"

I’ve been checking car rental prices and they haven’t dropped much (in France at least). This suggests to me that tourism isn’t dropping off a cliff yet.

"Don't worry Noraatc, most of us have no idea either."
"Two friends of mine arrived in London yesterday morning, staying at the Sheraton Grand Park Lane (where my one friend has been staying on business for the last 25 years...) They say the hotel is at ~50% capacity. I was able to re-book my hotel for later this month at a lower rate (saved almost 150 GBP over 7 nights). Now I just have to hope we can get there (and back.) Right now, I am a bit worried that my customers will pull the plug on anyone visiting their offices that have flown in from elsewhere. I have heard several instances of this, including the friend I reference above. Fingers crossed I still make it over! I've got dinner plans with local friends, theatre tickets for the weekend, etc. all planned out."
"Bring your own toilet paper.Otherwise, London is open as usual."
"Has there been any comment by government or others about closing popular tourist attractions - when the incidence rate rises to a given level?We are coming from Aus so we will be a long way from home.It is inevitable that the virus will continue to spread.The risks as I see it are:-Becoming sick and possibly hospitalised (we are over 65yrs) and partner having to pay for accomm while waiting-Changes/cancellations to flights and ferries, trains etc-Tourist attractions closing - so we miss out after long trip to get there-Getting stuck in transit if Singapore imposes further bansWould appreciate thoughts on this, thanks"
"@Noraatc - I’m from Sudbury as well. I heard Concord has its first case, along with Wellesley. This is bolstering my thinking that as long as there aren’t dire warnings in London and France and Amsterdam before I leave in early April, we’re going. I’m not feeling like my risk is a lot lower here at home if it’s out in the community already here at home."
"You as well, Noraatc! From what I read, the patient called ahead to Emerson so the staff was prepared; and it was a mild case and the person was sent home under quarantine. Reassuring that Emerson has it figured out. My mother lives next door in the senior care center, though, which is worrying. I can’t stop thinking about the senior home in Kirkland, WA.I do worry how easy it would to find care overseas (with no understanding of their system) but have to believe in the kindness of strangers helping you should that happen. I have confirmed my health plan covers me while abroad so I’m set there at least."
"#205 GreatTravelling.......that is how I see it........your costs could be extensive but not only if you get ill.......you might have to self quarantine if you are exposed to someone who has the virus. Where would a traveler stay in that case? Would your hotel have to provide accommodation for these additional days? How do you get food? If you then get ill and must be hospitalized who pays that bill? Most standard travel/medical insurance policies may not? Who pays for your new return flight home? Complicated questions and potentially very costly answers! I think the question is far more extensive than your chance of contracting the virus at home vs on “vacation.” Sorry, just being rational........the kindness of others may or may not be your salvation.Edited: 11:30 pm, March 07, 2020 "
"Has there been any comment by government or others about closing popular tourist attractions--Not in the UK. Major events like the Six Nations and football matches are under review; one of the Women's 6N matches this weekend has been postponed, but the others went ahead as planned. Some matches may happen, but without spectators. Of course, things may change; look at Lombardy. But the UK isn't there yet."
"Oh I agree, lots of unknowns . I would think the kindness of strangers would help direct me to a hospital if I needed one, for instance, or to help sort out where to go if quarantined. In mass quarantine events there must be some help (Red Cross?) for travelers? I’d love to see an article about what happens if you’re quarantined abroad - it feels like a real possibility but also a bit mysterious at the same time. Time will tell - We are not making any decisions until the start of April, at which time the UK and France May look like Milan and it will be an easy choice to stay home."
"if your tickets are booked with Delta, I just read that Delta has added an option to cancel flight booked prior to March 1. Just in case things get worse and cancellation is unavoidable or preferable.“You may choose to cancel your trip, and use the value towards a future flight. —You may cancel your flight and apply any unused value of the ticket toward the purchase of a new ticket for a period of one year from the original issue date.—Applicable change fee and fare difference will apply for new travel dates and will be collected at the time of booking the new ticket.”Edited: 7:59 am, March 08, 2020 "
Thanks Angela.....we did book our flights on Delta prior to March 1
"Booked for 8 nights in London, arriving on March 19 with our two teenagers. Living day-to-day with a back up plan to go to Buenos Aires if there is a travel warning/ban to the UK. We have until March 14 to get out of our Airbnb with just a loss of the service fee."
"MChiddy, sooner is better I think. Our trip is not until March 28. Have fun and come back safely as planned. Let us know how it’s going while you are in London as much as you possibly can please."
>>antibacterial hand wipes<< Check if those contain at least 60% alcohol.
"Yep, am aware of the effective ingredients, no worries."
"Safe travels, MChiddy! I will be anxiously waiting for your trip report. Thank you in advance for writing it for all of us who are planning to come to London soon.Enjoy London!Nora"
"Thanks! This is probably my 18th or 19th(?) trip (husband is from Woodford Green, Essex). It will be interesting to see if much has changed but I suspect it's pretty much business as usual, only with smaller crowds of tourists. Our only worry is visiting his elderly parents, which was the purpose of the trip when we booked it. We will play it by ear upon arrival but so far, they still want us to visit.Edited: 3:51 pm, March 08, 2020 "
Arrived in London yesterday. On day 2 of our trip had a awesome time walking around. Everything is normal here not any diff than US - hope it stays that way. Weather has been decent.
"Awesome news, Ayesha!!! Keep us posted please! Stay safe and healthy!Nora"
"Hi! We're planning an 8-day stay in London departing 13/MAR. Concerned about closures there, museums, sights, etc. Any info on that?"
Nobody knows.
"I can only assume that Ana W has not read the 200-odd previous posts that can be summarised thus: With some very minor exceptions, life in London and the rest of the UK continues as normal."
"MChiddy one idea might be to meet them at a tea garden or beach where you are all outside. See what they say. They will know the situation better than you.I live in a retirement area and we are continuing with all activities. Keeping fit, socialising (with sensible precautions) is important. Meeting you will do them more good providing you remember to take care."
"Hi Toopaz - Unfortunately, my in-laws are 88/89 yrs old and unwilling to get out and about due to knee and hip issues, and general disinterest. We will see how they feel about seeing us after we arrive, although their main concern wasn't about their health, but ours. Perhaps if the weather is nice, we can have a chat in their garden rather than in their enclosed lounge, as it typical when we visit.Edited: 10:57 am, March 09, 2020 "
"*as IS typical*We have plans with friends and tickets for various things, so all won't be lost if we don't make it to Woodford to visit them. My husband is just keenly aware of their age and with us being so far away, we have been trying to make the trip over a little more often. We were in London in October as well."
"Well, we've just received word that my in-laws don't want us to visit them, they aren't comfortable with the situation. So, we're deciding what we want to do now. I've prepaid our hotel for 9 nights and they have already told me that unless my flights are cancelled, they won't even think about issuing a credit towards a future stay. Hoping to still make the trip, as we were also planning on meeting up with various friends too.Ugh, what a mess!Edited: 12:03 pm, March 09, 2020 "
"If you are in good health, I would probably wait and decide, McChiddy. You have nothing to lose if you wait a bit longer. If I go, I will not be showing up at my parents’ house (87 and 90 years old) for two weeks upon my return. Best of luck with your decision!Nora"
"Hi, I live in outer London and had to go into town today. I was also on the King's Road on Saturday (for an appointment), and was surprised to see, on both occasions, that it was busy, as were London Victoria and London Bridge stations and the overground trains I took into central London. I think visitors in London right now, would see little difference from the norm. There is an undercurrent of anxiety- expect furious glares if you cough or sneeze! However, everything is open as usual.Unfortunately, as has happened in Italy, South Korea and elsewhere, the situation can alter rapidly as government advice changes/infection rates increase. It makes it impossible to know for certain whether to travel or not. I cancelled my own overseas plans for April as I didn't fancy being stranded far from home, but everyone's risk tolerance is different!Btw: You won't see many locals wearing masks, mainly because they are not widely available in UK shops at the best of times, (and not at all now). Some have been buying them at horrendously inflated prices online in small quantities for emergency use and DIY shops have sold out of dust masks, respirators, etc. However, there is no culture in the UK of mask wearing outdoors ordinarily, so things will have to get worse before those who do have them, bring them out in public!If visiting, please bring your own hand sanitizer and wipes. These haven't been available in shops for a couple of weeks, despite government claims that there is no problem with supply. This is partly due to hoarding but also to people buying in bulk and reselling at inflated prices. Supermarkets are only now, belatedly, trying to respond to this by introducing rationing for such items.As elsewhere in the world, toilet paper is becoming hard to find, but if staying in a hotel, this won't be an issue!I have another appointment in central London on Wednesday, so if I notice any changes, I will report back.:)"
"Oh, thank you so much for your post!! I so appreciate the information you've provided! And yes please, let us know how it is on Wednesday!"
"I had not, as I am normally not on this site. But thank you for your response."
"Poundland at Dalston Junction had supplies of household cleaners and wipes for those who must have single use products in a display very near the shop entrance this morning. They also had soaps, shower gels and hand washes on the shelves.Sainsbury's and Waitrose branches have cleaning products as do the M&S Food Halls I've been in. My Sainsbury's in Whitechapel was a bit picked over last Wednesday but was stocked up again by the weekend. The branches of Boots I've been in over the last few days have had soaps, shower gels and some cleaning products as well.Some people are making an effort to practice good cough or sneeze hygiene and some are not. What is notable is that people are talking about hand hygiene as if it was a new invention rather than a first line sensible measure.School parties are visiting museums, shoppers are out in full force, the markets are busy and life goes on. If asked, my take on things is that many people will do what they can to reduce the risk and hope they don't meed Covid 19, but aren't hiding from life in the short term."
"Delta extends its offer for change of flight or cancellation implying things are not looking good, Italy locks down the whole country, fear of being quarantined/ locked down while in London, and fear of being alienated when we get back from London (if we can come back as planned), fear of my daughter cannot go back to school when we get back (self quarantine), stock market is crashing....March 28 (my travel date) is still 19 days away and much can happen between now and then....I am so sad this is happening. What a mess!!!"
"I’ve been watching this thread and the news for awhile, trying to find info that would help quash the growing feeling inside me that we need to cancel our trip (18-days thru France-Netherlands-Germany-UK). We have decided to cancel - we can always go back next year. We were to leave a month from today, and if these countries are as impacted in a Months time as Italy is now, it would not be good to be there. Plus, my best friend has a bad case of asthma and we will have 2 teenagers with us. I wouldn’t want them quarantined in the states either upon their return. Really hard decision but we’ll regroup and plan a trip for 2021 (we will buy cancel for any reason insurance this time... you live and you learn). Several attractions seem to offer the ability to reschedule your tickets - I hope that will work out."
"I have followed this post and all of those who post that everything appears normal in the U.K......business as usual. It is not “normal” for those of us trying to decide whether to go ahead with our long planned trips. Each day the news makes you stand up and take notice......Italy locking down millions; Ireland canceling St. Patty’s Day Parade; cruise ships denied ports; concerts and sporting events cancelled; schools and universities closed; suggestion people over 60 refrain from flying. These are not normal times and traveling anywhere these days is risky. It is risky not only because museums might be closed.....it is risky because the spread of this virus changes by the day and no one can predict what tomorrow brings. Each of us must make our own decisions about upcoming travel but I would be very concerned about traveling until things settle down worldwide.Edited: 10:49 pm, March 09, 2020 "

"""I can’t seem to find news of it online?""Because there is no news to report."
No panic and no change in major tourist sites at the moment. London is open as usual!
"Just back from 2 days in London. All is as usual, tube trains, shops and galleries were just as crowded as always and I saw only 4 people wearing face masks and 3 of them were Asians who often wear them anyhow. In the lavatories people seemed to be a bit more thorough than usual with hand washing, otherwise no impact at all."
London is almost entirely normal at the moment.
"Hi, here is a link to an interesting news article on how people here are reacting:https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51815486:)"
"Yes, but the trouble with these articles is that the journalists hunt down the one person wearing a mask, or the one empty shelf in a shop, and use that to illustrate the article.I was just in London this weekend. Perhaps the traffic was a little lighter than usual, particularly out near the airport. But I didn’t see a single mask. People were out and about enjoying life more or less as normal. I am sure a lot of them are thinking about the virus, washing their hands more often and the rest. But so far, that’s it. Of course, looking at Italy, that might be about to change here, who can say?"
"I'm self-employed and rarely venture into London but did so today to spend a day in an office - afterwards friends and I went for dinner in Chinatown. Piccadilly seemed about normal for a rainy Tuesday evening when we arrived at 7pm, but it was a little quieter than usual at 9pm when we left - although far from deserted. I had to stand for one stop on the Piccadilly Line and then got a seat despite some delays on the line. But nothing stood out as being abnormal and I think people are going about their everyday lives for the moment.I realised it's perfectly possible to avoid touching anything on the Tube if you're able to stand without holding on and avoid holding the handrail on stairs and escalators."
"Hi, the article I mentioned doesn't say that many people are wearing masks, (I haven't seen anyone wearing them myself except for a couple of tourists, who presumably brought them with them). I merely thought it was an interesting piece, with some good BBC links on related topics that may be of interest to overseas visitors. Having said that, I did see people wearing their scarves over their mouths on the tube and train yesterday, (and it wasn't cold!) My son noticed the same thing in London on Saturday. I agree that London seems as busy as ever. Those tourists who are here are going about as usual, enjoying their visit, as everything is open. Some city companies are encouraging more from home working, however, where this is possible. All the cinemas and theatres are open. My son goes to the cinema regularly and says it's been as busy as usual. The restaurants near me seem to have been quieter in the last week, but Costa and Starbucks were as busy as ever! For now, life is continuing much as normal, but people are following the news with more than usual interest here."
"Latest figures from Heathrow Airport this morning say travelers are down 4.8%;Put in reverse then, 95.2% are traveling as normal . . .Not saying it's right or wrong, just an observation ."
"The British health minister has just tested positive to the virus. Although many on this forum continue to claim that it is business as usual the risks are very much alive. I think every traveler must consider those risks and the consequences should they get the virus while on vacation, especially an international trip."
"The business as usual posts refer to the day-to-day normal things at that moment such as are attraction open, are people out and about etc."
"Actually it is a junior minister in the Department of Health, Nadine Dorries, that has been infected, rather than the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, himself.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51827356Ms Dorries has since tweeted that the experience was ""...pretty rubbish, but I hope I'm over the worst of it now..."" Which suggests that the majority of people who do catch the virus will recover, as has been borne out by statistics. Yes, there are risks in travelling, but the point is that there are also risks in remaining in your home country. Latest figures show that the UK has 5.6 cases of the virus per 1,000,000 of population, whilst the figure for the US is 3.1.So in deciding what to do I would consider your own state of health, whether your insurance covers you if you do become ill, and the official advice from your own government.I am travelling to the United States between April 25th and May 18th, and am not gonig to cancel unless:-(i) The UK government advises against all but essential travel to the US(ii) The US government decides to prohibit entry to the US for UK citizens(iii) My airline (Aer Lingus) cancels the flight.If any of these event occur, my insurance will kick in, and I will be able to rearrange the trip for later in the year."
"If London enacts more draconian measures to combat coronavirus, such as banning gatherings of crowds, closing attractions, etc., does the rest of England have to follow suit? If social distancing works, and flights don't get cancelled by the airlines, would tourism be ""normal"" in the Bath, Cotswolds, Glastonbury, Wells, Stonehenge, Avebury circuit?"
Many scientists and doctors strongly suggest the way to “control” this virus is to be aggressive now and anticipate what WILL happen in the days and weeks ahead. To say that this virus will merely disappear and things will continue as normal is very unrealistic. Good luck with your travel plans.
"I’m a traveler. I canceled my 18-day trip yesterday (April 8 - Paris, April 26-London). I’ve been on these forums and read the news, but haven’t been able to find out what happens if you are quarantined away from home - do you get put in a hotel? By yourself of with your traveling companions? Are you charged a reasonable hotel rate or are you at hotel’s mercy? How do you get food and necessities if you’re sick and in quarantine? These are the kinds of questions that aren’t answered. If anyone has seen an article with specifics pls post on this forum. Everything I’ve read is so general that it leaves you with all the same concerns. After what happened in Italy I decided it wasn’t worth the risk if the rest of Europe was about a month behind Italy, since I was to travel in a month. I am sure I have as much chance of catching the virus here in the US but it feels like it would be easier to deal with at home. Also, I don’t think I’d be ‘present’ if we took the vacation - I’d be too worried about whether X was open or if we could take the train to Y. This decision is personal to us, and was hard, but now that it’s been made I feel a rush of relief.Edited: 7:14 am, March 11, 2020 "
>>To say that this virus will merely disappear and things will continue as normal is very unrealistic.<<Who said that...?
I came to the same conclusion as SMa1983.....too many unanswered questions especially for international travelers. Should the virus spread rapidly in an area a traveler would be more vulnerable not only to the virus but to circumstances in general. And how much fun is a vacation with that hanging over you?The President of the United States feels it will magically disappear. The scientists feel we are just at the beginning of this crisis. We dropped the ball on testing so accurate numbers are unknown......I do not know the extent of testing in the U.K.
"I am so torn at this point. I want to go but the fear of the unforeseen events is getting stronger. I have asthma and it is complicated to think of the unexpected expenses if I get the virus and have to be hospitalized during my trip in London even though I have travel insurance. I haven’t cancelled anything yet because I am still hopeful. Delta’s condition of rebooking has to be done within one year of the original issues date (I purchased on Jan 13) meaning we can’t go during spring break next year (April 2021). I am still in a “wait and see” mode until a week before my travel date (March 28). I have decided to cancel my upcoming trip to California (2 days after my London trip) to attend a conference. That decision is much easier than our London trip.Edited: 7:46 am, March 11, 2020 "
"Im in wait and see too, but not feeling good about it as I did a week ago. Read an article recently that said most likely this virus will hit everywhere and so no place is safe including your home (it wasnt a ""scare"" tactic article), so you should decide if you do get it are you more comfortable in your own country for care and/ or is the country you are visiting up to the standard of care you would need. Live in Colorado and in the last few days we have seen more cases reported. Event cancellations and school closings. We are schedule for April 22 to London and April 28 to Portugal so hoping for some better news in a few weeks. Just hoping BA credits our ticket for further travel."
"Hi, Re: TestingI don't think they are testing people here in the UK unless they are either already in hospital and showing symptoms or have returned from Italy, etc. or have knowingly been in contact with someone who has. This is despite evidence of community transmission having begun in the UK. My son woke up this morning very poorly, with symptoms of the coronavirus. (Of course it could be flu or a bad cold.) However, he travels into London by train and packed tube every day, so we are concerned.He was told by NHS111 that he couldn't be tested as he didn't meet the aforementioned criteria. The gp won't see him either as his symptoms are those of the coronavirus. He wasn't told to isolate himself by the NHS advisor, which I find even more worrying. I really sympathise with those due to travel. I cancelled my own forthcoming visit to Japan and South Korea. Not an easy decision, but the right one for us."
"This is a link to an article about the effect - if any - on tourism so far. The Guardian is not, imo, known for being alarmist. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/0…"
"Here's another one from the Metro. This publication doesn't have the gravitas of the broadsheet, but it is an interesting article, with pictures:https:/…"
"Just returned from a two week trip. If no one had told me that there was the Covid 19 virus going on, I wouldn't have known. I saw may be 3 people in masks (one at the York train station, two in the London tube). Among other things, I went to Mamma Mia and Les Miserables, and it was full house. I didn't notice any empty shelves at the supermarkets (Sainsbury, Co-Op) that I went for groceries. Things can certainly change very quickly but if I were in the process of planning a trip, I would just continue to monitor. And unless I am older, have a history of respiratory system problems or in questionable health, I would wait-and-see."
PLtraveler ......glad you had a great trip....did not realize Le Mis still sold outWhat is today or last week is not what will be next week or next month. It is risky to travel internationally at this time ...... how risky is difficult to say
"Of course the past cannot predict what's going to happen in the future when it comes to Covid-19. But if you read everything in the news, you would think supermarkets are being raided, people are wearing face masks to the hilt on the buses and in the tube. But that's not quite the case, and that is something to keep in mind when trying to filter the information coming in."
"I had to cancel my trip to London for next week due to a travel ban/restriction by my employer.As I understand theatre/musical tickets are non-refundable, also my prebooked ticket for the Tutankhamun Exhibition. I have tickets with my friend for the Warner Bros. Studio Tour, we still don't know what to do with those.My employer will pay for all non-refundable expenses, which is a lot at the moment."
"I don't think there's anything to do. You could contact the theatres and WB Studios. I don't think they'll refund anything, but at least the WB Studios are usually sold out so they might be able to let someone else use the space. Then get the money back from your employer."
I contacted WB HP studio last week and they said they will allow change of date without a fee or full refund if trip is cancelled. You just need to call them to make a request for refund.
"I am at the wait and see model, as my family will be traveling on April 7th. I think we should be fine but if it develops and spread then I would cancel. I already contacted my AirBnb host just in case as for my airfare I dont think Norwegian will allow any credits or anything it would be wash, I havent contacted them."
"If London enacts more draconian measures to combat coronavirus, such as banning gatherings of crowds, closing attractions, etc., does the rest of England have to follow suit?--The Mayor doesn't have that power – public health is a matter for local councils and the NHS. I think only HM Government could order such restrictions, but it would be done on a locality-by-locality basis in the first instance"
"It's my friends birthday, March 21 so she'll ask her friend. If her friend can't go to the WB Studios with her, yes we'll ask WB Studios for a refund. Both, 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child' and Delfont Mackintosh Theatres don't refund tickets, they would exchange them to an alternative date. Which isn't possible for me. I'll most likely come to London later this year for one of the NFL UK games, but they aren't announced yet, so I can't plan anything at the moment."
"I very much doubt if any tourist attraction would wish to be seen as profiting from coronavirus.I would expect refunds to be forthcoming from many operators who don't usually issue refunds, and alternative arrangements such as change of date being offered by others."
"Supposed to fly tomorrow night from the East Coast for a 3 day London mini-break, just got a Washington Post push that the White House is considering a Level 3 Travel Advisory on all of Europe now, all but guaranteeing we cancel as traveling w/ our two kids as well. Only a matter of time before they get sent home from school for 2 weeks anyway, don't want to risk having THAT mess start just for them as soon as we get back, plus risk of stranding. Prez addressing nation @ 8, chances high he will want to show off yet more Wall-building by bragging about banning nonessential EU travel too. Off to make calls and figure out how to break the news :("
Can you recommend some restaurants near Russel Square? Our hotel is very close.
Antalya Restaurant (Turkish) in Southampton Row is quite good.https://antalyarestaurant.co.uk/
Le Bistro Savoir Faire is a TA London favourite.http://savoir.co.uk/savoir/
And Trattoria Verdi Restaurant is a nice Italian sometimes with a pianist as a bonus.https://www.trattoriaverdi.co.uk/
For such a serious topic you might think restaurant questions AND recommendations should be in a separate post. Everyone has their own priorities I guess.
"martyap, very few people are affected by Coronavirus for the rest of us life must go on as usual."
"Auld Jimmy, those are almost exactly the same words said by our Italian friends in Emilia Romagna two weeks ago."
"Carry-on-as-normal 'Blitz spirit' in this situation shows ignorance and selfishness, not strength of character. Everyone can and should do everything within their ability to minimise the spread of the disease, for other people's sake. A lot of us have to attend and travel to work, but we don't need to engage in unnecessary additional activities. The more people demonstrate stupidity in the face of the crisis, the more likely it is that we will have restrictions forced upon us by the government."
"“martyap,very few people are affected by Coronavirus for the rest of us life must go on as usual.“That’s what Tom Hanks and his wife thought. I hope you are right and this forum can return to posts about restaurants and theater tickets. The question is whether the “leaders” of the USA and U.K. are doing everything to mitigate the spread of this virus or are they merely saying it will magically disappear. That method did not fair well for Italy."
"We are due to fly from NZ to London at the end of March for most of April, spending a couple of nights in Bali on the way. I’ve been following this thread to keep my optimism going but today had really knocked my confidence that the trip can take place. London and the south east are my home. My elderly dad is there. I haven’t been home in a few years and I’m desperate to see him. But Don’t want to risk bringing the virus to him. The whole situation sucks.Will keep reading here though. If people are adamant that London goes on as usual 10 days from now, 12 days from now, who knows.Edited: 6:40 am, March 12, 2020 "
"The government is set to announce new restrictions today. Seems likely to be school closures and ban on public gatherings. So I expect places like museums, cinemas, theatres etc will be affected.By the way, I don't think Bali is safe! A British tourist died there this week."
Your last sentence is omniscient . I never try to paint refined gold I can add nothing more to it. So sorryRegmaiche
"@Ariel-Scarlett - and my Finnish based company just banned all international travel! So no London for me, just cancelled my flight and hotel. I have theatre tickets for next Saturday night which I offered (free, of course) to my friends that live in town. But now wondering if West End shows will be cancelled as well..."
"In Scotland the First Minister is recommending that all gatherings of over 500 people be cancelled, from Monday. The UK government may decide on similar measures."
The handwriting has been on the wall for a while. Unfortunately I feel we are in for a prolonged ordeal. Hope everyone stays safe and healthy.
"Ok I decided to cancel my trip to London (March 28-April 5) even though U.K. is excluded from the travel ban. Much can happen on UK side (travel ban, attractions closures, etc) between now and then. I have spent too much time to think, read, educate myself for the last 4-5 weeks and it is time to get over with it for now. I will reschedule my trip to London once the virus is under controlled and things are back to normal.Edited: 9:17 am, March 12, 2020 "
"@Angela, I think that is a very wise decision. I am not an alarmist (nor a germaphobe - I just flew on a 6 hour flight yesterday!) But it is so very stressful to figure out ""what's next"" in the list of bans, restrictions, etc. I will say I am very happy that my upcoming April holiday is in Key West - even if my flight gets cancelled, I can do a REALLY long road trip from NJ."
"@jtwiz, thank you! I also cancelled my trip to CA in April. I travel to Tampa FL once a month by plane but I have been thinking about driving instead of I still have to go (work related) during this chaos. I have asthma so I am in a high risk group.Edited: 10:48 am, March 12, 2020 "
">>In Scotland the First Minister is recommending that all gatherings of over 500 people be cancelled.<<Same here, those are cancelled until the end of May. I'm very glad I got to see Bryan Adams last weekend before the next gigs were cancelled...Interesting to see if the Eurovision Song Contest will be axed."
"I am in the same boat as well, Ariel. With all the restrictions, I have very little hope that my trip will happen. I will cancel my hotel soon (luckily, it is a Marriott hotel with free cancellation) and will call Virgin Atlantic to ask for rescheduling. @jtwiz, I guess, the road trip to FL from NJ does not sound too bad: my family members do it every year to my surprise. We are considering only road trips for this year; luckily, New England and Nova Scotia offer amazing opportunities."
My hotel reservation is non-refundable unfortunately. I'm not touching my flight yet - if there's any chance that Finnair will cancel it then I'm just going to wait. If I cancel the flight myself I'll only get half of it refunded.
"Hi Ariel, it makes sense to call the hotel and ask what they can do for you. The whole world is in the uncharted territory now and in the pretty gloomy one, so I hope they will cooperate with you and maybe at least allow to reschedule, as other businesses do. So sorry about it! I know how you wanted this trip to happen. Nora"
"Best of luck, Ariel! I am waiting for Virgin Atlantic at this point: maybe they will allow cancellation vs.rescheduling. If not, I will reschedule for September 2020. Not the right time to travel for sure..."
"We are - were - flying Emirates who are offering to park our fares if we re-book by August, without penalty. Hotels and car hire being similarly accommodating, although I’m yet to find out about a couple of pre-paid Premier Inn stays. We have tours booked at the Tower of London, Harry Potter Studios etc also, has anyone found places like that to be flexible?"
"I'm booked to leave Chicago for London this Sunday the 15th. I'll stick to the plan even though I'm having 2nd thoughts. What is going to be so different is that I would expect the international terminal at O'hare (Chicago) to be close to empty on Sunday. Unless I misunderstand, nothing would be going out other than to the UK."
So I have been asked by my coworkers over the last few weeks if we are still going. I finally told them yes we have cancelled our trip today and that is when one of my coworker opened up. He said if we went then I will have to be quarantined for 14 days before going back to work. It is not his to say but I can see that some other employees would refuse to come to the office if I show up after coming back from London. Same with my daughter’s school. Some moms have told me they were concerned about our trip as well and they are uncomfortable about my daughter returning to school after our trip. So there are much more to think about at this point. The travel ban has made me call it enough until things are normal again.
"Thank you, MChiddy! Not the same atmosphere in NYC... Broadway shows are getting canceled, Metropolitan Museum is closed, etc., etc."
"Hi Angela - It sounds like you made a wise choice for your family and community. I am lucky in that we don't have kids at home anymore and we also work at home. So self quarantine for a few weeks wouldn't be a total hardship, if necessary. London and the rest of Europe will survive and you'll get there eventually ❤"
"MChiddy, thanks! We have until Dec 30, 2020 to reschedule and travel so hopefully we can go by then."
"Just remember, everything is closed on Christmas Day, virus or otherwise ;-)"
"Re 304 - RetiredTripper -you might be interested in this.https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-government-announces-moving-out-of-contain-phase-and-into-delayUK is moving out of ""Contain"" phase to ""Delay"". The action plans for Delay stage include banning large scale gatherings. I would expect this is the time that closings will begin to be announced.Also - if you are flying out of ORD on UA or AA, you leave from a domestic terminal. But if BA, Terminal 5. And, I would agree, 5 is likely to be fairly empty"
"Angela, interesting discussion from your co-workers and fellow moms. I honestly didn't consider that. Because our travel isn't for 2 more weeks, I'm holding out that the flight is cancelled by Delta. I want a refund, not a crappy credit (particularly since I only spent $2669 for 4 tickets w/ seat assignments), and you know the airlines will do everything they can to recoup their losses from this. I imagine travel later this year will be twice the cost, leaving you to pay significantly out of pocket.Edited: 8:16 am, March 13, 2020 "
"@europelover2014Yes. I read BBC news online twice a day and keep up with all things UK. My assumption right now, and of course could change, is that the museums will stay open a while longer. I have no interest in other venues such as theater or concerts. A large part of my trip (which could increase) is walking through various neighborhoods and along the canals, and I would be ok with a trip that becomes almost entirely outdoors. And yes, I always fly BA so it should be pretty darn quiet.Edited: 9:21 am, March 13, 2020 "
"^^^ I hope you have a good trip. I have mentally written off my May visit. I am also canceling a domestic flight next week. Our local library, schools, park district have shut down (north 'burbs). I'm not going to risk being exposed somewhere and bring that back to a community that is trying to fight back. It will happen - but I couldn't live with being my area's ""patient zero"".Edited: 10:21 am, March 13, 2020 "
We are booked to leave from NYC Monday. Having many second thoughts.
"#312 I'm due to go to NZ/Australia in 2 weeks, and if I rebook for later in the year flight costs go up 30%. Definitely also hoping for a flight cancellation / ban on incoming flights."
"Dayton, I used Skymiles to book our flights. I called Delta yesterday and the automated answering service said they will call me back “more than 6 hours”. It has been about 30 hours and I have not heard back from them. The online Coronavirus update said unless you are traveling within 72 hours don’t call them. I am also hoping to see the my flight get cancelled so I can get the miles deposited back to my account without restrictions if when I have to use them. I hope you can get all your money back!"
Thanks for your detailed response! We’re suppose to travel next Friday. We are still on the fence at this moment. Going to wait and see what next week brings.
"We’ve decided to not proceed with our planned March 18 Family trip. It’s become clear that the trip wouldn’t be “as planned” even under the best of circumstances. Too much anxiety, too many questions, things like our Paris day trip already off the list. Non-refundable expenses hurt, but- truthfully- the money would have all been spent 2 weeks from now either way. I will cancel the Delta tickets this weekend, and have some credit for future. (Warning to others who haven’t looked: everyone seems to be pushing trips to end of summer, and prices seem to be skyrocketing)"
Harry Potter has closed and I received an email that they will call and give a full refund in upcoming weeks.
"Hi, I’m in London now and everything is business as usual. Not sure how long that will last, but for now they’re just saying “wash your hands a lot and you’ll be ok.” Everything is open. Good servers and hotel staff can be seen wearing gloves and sometimes masks as a precaution. No one is panicking (yet)."
>>Everything is open.<<No it's not. As you can read in the post immediately preceding yours.
"Tina, I don’t know where you are from and if you have visited before but you give the impression that everything is normal. No it’s not. London is quieter than normal, there fewer tourists, workers are working from home. So please be accurate. Royal Opera House has stopped back stage tours and I’m sure that other attractions may also implement changes.I would prefer that tourists did not come to the UK even though there are no bans. We don’t want tourists to bring the virus with you, we don’t want tourists to have to use our over stretched NHS. As a tourist you should Not want to take the virus back to your country. This virus needs to run its course and that will take time. It won’t disappear in one season we could be faced with it next winter."
"Much of Central London, it's many attractions, streets, squares etc now resemble The Whispering Gallery at St Paul's Cathedral... so, so quiet.Keep well allAnthony K"

Well that's great for you
They haven't closed anything officially but everywhere pretty empty and think official closure will come in next few weeks anyway.I wouldn't waste your money visiting London atm not a happy place

"Yes, just saw that our wonderful leader had his temperature taken, got tested for the virus and announced the extension of his travel ban to include the UK/Ireland starting Monday. I don’t think the US and Europe will move towards controlling this virus until drastic measures are enacted similar to China and North Korea..........i have been following this thread for a while and feel for those who had their travel plans ruined, lost money, etc........but control of this virus is what is paramount. We are schedule to travel to London/Edinburgh in September and even that might be dubious. Stay safe, stay healthy"

I have a trip scheduled in April - bu still want to go. Just wondering how long the Great Briain travel ban will go
Your guess on the length of travel restrictions is as good as anyone's. The virus is not going away anytime soon.
Scientists calling for more restrictions in the UKhttps:/…science-environment-51892402
Looks like we got out at a good time. Sad we had to cut the trip short but happy for the time we did get!
"I'm still leaving from US on an overnight to arrive in London on Monday, the 16th. There is no barrier to coming back from the UK as long as you're a US citizen. I will have to self quarantine on my return.  Not to be at all flippant, but if I get ill in the UK, at least I can get tested and get better hospital care in London than I would at home (at least for now)."
Extend your stay and save us your sophism. You are willingly and selfishly flying into a hotspot that everyone agrees contributes to spreading the virus and threatens others on your return.
"Not sophistry, truth. I can't get a test here at this time. I've checked. U.S is not prepared, UK is."
"“ at least I can get tested and get better hospital care in London than I would at home (at least for now).”So you will use our stretched. NHS, so selfish. Stay at home, you don’t know if you are bringing the virus with you. Why should the NHS use valuable resources on you."
Re #341 You have got to be kidding....
"So many have lost the concept of ‘sacrifice for the greater good’ these days. It’s sad, and scary in this situation. No amount of lost deposit on your trip, or disappointment, is worth the risks - which are real and varied. London will still be there when this mess is over. Be patient."
"I just canceled my April trip. Really, London does not me now and my family certainly does. And it looks like poster #341 wants to get into the 14 days quarantine upon his return and does not realize that UK has to take care of her own citizens now and not of him. So selfish and irresponsible!"
"Some abuse this forum to advance a political agenda and bash someone they disagree with. Happens all the time. Gratuitous swipe. Disguised as travel question or advice. Plus, in this case, the selfishness."

"RE Post 347 ...Cancelling an April trip. What have your trip providers said about refunds or vouchers?Is anyone cancelling May trips, yet?CheersAnthony"
"If 341 is under 50 and in good health normally the likelihood that they will use NHS resources is smaller than normal. If they get the virus - and that is not guaranteed as some family members of those infected do not - they are unlikely to need a hospital bed. Increased hand washing here means less transmission of other infections. If they self-isolate on return there is less risk they will transmit the virus than if they stay in America. The virus is already widespread in America and is going to spread even further thanks to a health care system that is costly and inefficient and a president who hammered the public health budget and doesnt listen to experts. That is not a political comment it's a statement of fact by someone with no axe to grind.For those at low risk life will, and should, go on - those at higher risk need to look to protecting themself."
341 has been married for 40 years so I'm guessing they may be just a little bit over 50...

"People,I would like to request that when you post on here, could you please try and be very precise? My rant deals with two posts from yesterday #333 (Loup Garou) and #336 (Confuso) who state that the US is banning travel to the UK. This is NOT true. The current US ban (with the UK to be added on Monday) means that the US is banning non-US citizens from entering INTO the US, not keeping anyone from leaving the US.For those of us closely watching the situation, and slated to travel in the next week or two, (although we most decidedly will not be traveling), this could mean the difference between getting an airline voucher for future travel vs. getting a full refund (if our borders actually ARE closed.) We are still in a wait and see situation, but posting false information, or rather poorly worded information, does nothing to help those of us looking to get the most up-to-date information. And, of course, I double and triple fact check anything that pops up on the TA website, but don't give those of us hoping for full refunds false hope.Small potatoes in light of the overall seriousness of the world situation, I know, but please allow me my rant. This is, after all, a site that deals with TRAVEL. So please endeavor to be more precise in the future.Thank you."

There are many knowledgeable experts here, but also a fair number of cranks, bored pensioners, obsessives, infirmed elderly, those suffering savior complexes, etc. You know who you are. I enjoy coming here to expose snark, puncture overblown ego and fight condescension.

"#361,Perhaps you might wish to review your statement a bit.Here is a report from the BBC: https:/…world-us-canada-51891662CNN: https:/…index.htmlFOX News: https:/…trump-european-travel-ban-uk-irelandUnlike some... I watched the press conference at 9:30M (MDT), regarding the widening of the travel ban, by the USA, effective Monday, Mar 16, at Midnight (EDT?).As stated, details were light, but would assume to be forthcoming.Maybe time to study the situation more closely?Best of luck,Hunt"
"#369,Thank you for the links. I have seen them, but unfortunately, these do prove my argument (albeit, very poorly worded sometimes.) Reading VERY carefully is a must.The BBC article title clearly states ""US to extend travel ban to UK . . ."" When the travel ban came out, it (took a day or two, but) was (eventually) explained as a ban only for those COMING or RETURNING to the US, and would ban only non-US citizens. If you don't know this, it could be easy to be misled by these articles. The was poorly handled initially, but certainly has been clarified as such since then. This article just adds the UK to this existing ban. It does not say the US is banning OUTGOING travel to the UK.Similarly, quoting from the CNN article: ""the ban on foreign nationals ENTERING (my capitalizing) the US from Britain or Ireland will begin at midnight on Monday, Vice President Mike Pence said."" No OUTGOING bans instituted. Much the same with the Fox news article.However, the president is said to be considering some DOMESTIC travel bans, which would not affect international travel.  If you have an article that clearly states that the US has banned OUTGOING international travel specifically, or plans to, please post the link and I will be glad to reconsider your statements! And thanks for reading my initial post.Edited: 12:40 pm, March 15, 2020 "

I think it would be best to contact your hotel of choice directly.
Re 416You won't be coming to London in 4 weeks time...I've got a crystal ball ... and another couple.Anthony K
Anthony it's definitely looking that way. Getting back to my post if hotels don't comply or there is a loophole where they can open their bars and restaurants then they'll have the monopoly. To make matters worse there is no endpoint and new restrictions to clamp down even more seem inevitable.
"Restaurants can remain open but only for take away. The same applies for restaurants in hotels.""Johnson said that with the agreement of the three devolved governments, “we are telling – telling – cafes, pubs, bars and restaurants to close tonight, as soon as they reasonably can, and not open tomorrow”. They would be allowed to sell takeaway food and drink, he added.""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/2…The same policy is being adopted in many other countries."
"Very happy for you, Ariel!"
I've been checking their website daily. If I had cancelled right away (when I decided not to go) I would've gotten nothing. Then they amended their policy stating they'd give a 50% refund. And now they've amended again. So it paid off to just wait.
Exactly! This is what I am doing with my airline reservation. The hotel has been canceled at no charge.
Happy for you Ariel! I am still waiting for Delta to cancel my flights but they have not. My flight is in 6 days. I am going to wait till Tuesday before calling them for assistance. Hoping for full refund.
"Call Delta. I was supposed to leave 3/17 for London. I called Delta on 3/11 (before everything properly blew up) with the intent to cancel. I was hoping for an e-Credit at best since these were definitely non-refundable tickets, but the Delta agent actually offered a full refund, no further questions asked. It was about a 1.5 hr wait to speak to someone at that point though. Sure enough, a couple of days later, the flight we were supposed to leave on was listed as cancelled, so maybe they knew something beforehand."
I was able to get a refund for my Virgin Atlantic flight. Details: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g1-i10…

"Ariel and ClintG1, I knew I couldn’t travel since the travel ban to U.K. begun about 2-3 weeks before my travel date. I slowly cancelled my reservations but Delta flights and travel insurance were the last in my list to cancel because I wanted to wait for Delta to cancel it so I get full refund instead of voucher. I called Delta 5 days before my travel date (March 28) even though my flight has not been canceled because my friend told me she cancelled her trip and got full refund. I got full refund both for my flight sans travel insurance. I am still waiting for a refund from WB HP studio and Parliament tour (both of these places sent me an email they will refund). Heathrow express offers rebooking within 12 months so I emailed them also but haven’t heard back but at this point I don’t know if we can travel to London within 12 months. Should things get back to normal, our spring break next year is a week later than this year so it will be a week over 12 months. But that is alright because I bought the tickets in advance and it wasn’t that expensive."
"If the 40 years I’ve lived here, I’ve not seen anything like this. Streets are deserted, everything is closed. You can only hear the ambulance sirens. Very somber. But London will bounce back. It’s people are very resilient."
"Very eerie in New York as well and I believe we have several weeks to go before we peak. We are not scheduled to visit London until mid September and question if we will be “ready” to travel internationally even then. Until there is a proven vaccine I think we might limit travel closer to home. Stay safe as we all look forward to a cold pint, on a warm summer night, at our favorite pub."
"At 8 am yesterday, my local Asda, Feltham, West London, now opening 8 am to 8 pm Monday to Saturday only, taking advantage of priority entrance for the aged and disabled, I found most shelves to be very well stocked. The store has a Bakery, which is fully operational, except they will not handle your chosen loaf and slice it for you, which is only right. Only some medication was in short supply. And I am delighted to say there was no sign of them profiteering. Queues, at 8 am, stretched the length of the store building and round it's far corner.I was one of only three people on my local bus, in both directions. Drivers were masked-up and everyone that I noted kept a social distance apart.These unprecedented times can be managed, if we are sensible.Keep well allAnthony K"
"Ariel - that's unfortunate. Do you not have a goverment 'no travel' advisory you can use to claim back on travel insurance? Or the ability to postpone travel date ir get a voucher from Finnair? Some European airlines are offering such for even still running flights.Off topic but I had a peek at flightradar24, saddo that I am, and I was amazed how many aircraft there were across European airspace still flying scheduled flights. Even Alitalia had flights to several European cities in the air at the time I peeked.SWT"

"^^^ How nice. The Chatham Historic Dockyards will be sending a ""gift certificate"" for use through April 2021. My booked and paid for date was mid May. I can't think that this will do me much good - although I will be the first to return to the UK as soon as safe. The dockyards close over the winter months, further limiting access. It strikes me as quite a limited amelioration when they have canceled tours which have been pre-paid and closed the facility. I am sympathetic to the situation and if asked would probably have donated my already paid fees - but their method of dictating terms that do not consider the circumstances of the visitor is off-putting.It seems the Chatham Historic Dockyard Trust is a Registered Charity. Does anyone know if this response is typical of historic trusts? Anyone aware of similar policies at London venues?Edited: 11:01 am, April 09, 2020 "
"Chatham Docks Website shows that this year they were planned to be open from 8 Feb to 22 November.Frankly I would not want to be there in winter anyway, they are only closed December/January (OK if you want to be pedantic, the last week in Nov and the first week in Feb)It is a large open site without much shelter. I can imagine that it would be bitter cold at that time of year, especially with the coastal wind whipping across the site.They are doing you a favour not opening at that time, frankly."
Is Chatham Dockyard one of those places that needs to be booked in advance?
"You can get a bit of a discount at Chatham Historic Docks if you book on-line, but no, you don't need to book in advance.Went there just under a year ago, I think we actually booked 'on line' on the day, before we set off on our journey from Essex.But there were peeps buying their tickets 'at the gate' with no problems."

"I had booked a ""Call the Midwife"" tour as a treat for my traveling companion and myself. They sell out, so it was necessary to book in advance. I booked before the pandemic hit the US or the UK in great measure through the Dockyard's website. Ordinarily, I would not have pre-booked for a simple visit to the Dockyards.I am disappointed that the remediation for those of us - there will be many - who have paid for tours that are now cancelled is a gift certificate that will have a very limited time for use. I was interested that the National Gallery was immediately forthcoming in refunding ticket prices for exhibits that are now closed. It is disappointing that the Dockyards doesn't have the same consideration for those of us who have paid for cancelled events. I recognize this is a circumstance beyond anyone's control, but to not offer refunds for events which the venue has cancelled is hardly good customer service.Edited: 2:51 pm, April 09, 2020 "
">>>You can get a bit of a discount at Chatham Historic Docks if you book on-line, but no, you don't need to book in advance.<<<Thanks, EW. I've been thinking about a trip exploring Kent for a while, but my wife wasn't as keen as me. Thanks to the lockdown she is now keen to go anywhere at all, so both Kent and Norfolk have risen up the list.When we do go to the area, Chatham historic Dockyard will be on the list. She really enjoyed the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard."
"The ""Call the Midwife"" tours are a separate business from the main Chatham Dockyards, IIRC, although tickets for those tours allow 'normal' access to the Dockyards, of course!NB you did not mention that in your original complaint.AndMaybe you should take this up with Neal Street Productions...."
I really don't see what else they can do. The alternative would be permanent closure which nobody wants.We have also been given credit towards a future visit on a couple of things booked for our now cancelled US trip at the end of this month and I was more than happy to accept that credit even if we can't get there inside the next 12 months.
"Thank you for the Neal Productions idea. I haven't really explored the issue fully. Getting a refund is truly the least of my concerns in the current environment! However, After Anthony in #462 posted his National Gallery experience, I wondered if there was any ""standard"" response from London and London area venues. I thought I might get more general info from locals - Neal Productions is a great start!If it is a gift certificate only, even without the Neal Production Midwife Tour, I do hope I can use it. I am eager to see the Dockyards - the tour was really more for my friend. I am able to get over to London fairly frequently. Maybe it will be safe to do so next spring - if not, I'll consider the lost cost of the tour and entrance fee as my small contribution to the facility! I also have a credit on lodging in the Lake District - can't wait to use that! Thank you all!Edited: 6:22 pm, April 09, 2020 "
"There is no ""standard response"".Each attraction/service provider is doing their best in difficult circumstances."
"Colleagues, on this tread and others, myself and others have recently criticised British Airways. May I just place here a message I received yesterday ...From our family to yours Thu, 9 Apr 2020 16:24British Airways (BritishAirways@fly.ba.com)Dear Mr Kreppel,For only the second time in our 100-year history, (the first being during the Second World War), the majority of our British Airways aircraft have now touched down in London, leaving just a small fleet flying to bring people home to their loved ones and to deliver critical supplies to countries and people in need.As borders continue to close and the world comes to a temporary standstill, we wanted to extend our heartfelt thanks to you for your incredible support of British Airways and our crews, and to send our warmest thoughts to you and to those who may be suffering at the hands of this unexpected crisis.As difficult as it has been for our teams and our customers, we stand together. Our business stands on strong foundations. At its heart are many thousands of colleagues who care passionately about the airline, Britain and the nations and customers we serve.An incredible new global community has emerged from the situation we find ourselves in and that is something for us all to feel proud of. Hundreds of thousands of people have volunteered their services to help organisations around the world, so too have many of our own people, and for that we are proud and grateful. While many of our aircraft remain on the ground, we will take inspiration from the heroes who are working on the front line and we will continue to serve Britain as best we can.Sadly, we know that now is not the time to travel. We don’t know when it will be, but we do know that when our aircraft are cleared for take-off once again, it will be epic. Families will be reunited, the wheels of industry will start turning again and when they do, we’ll be ready, to fly and to serve.Until then, from our family to yours, thank you and we wish you well.Thank you,Alex CruzChairman and CEO, British Airways"
Anthony I think vast numbers of people received that email.
And many did not ...
"""And many did not ...""Is it of any relevance to those that didn't get it? Or indeed those that did?"
Quite right John.Anthony anybody who has travelled with BA would have got that email. The people who did not get it as they have not travelled with BA probably could not give a toss.
Couldn't agree more John.A load of PR waffle thats says and means nothing.
"Actually, all airlines sent emails to the passengers with booked tickets. I received several emails from Virgin Atlantic and from Delta. No need to cut and paste well known information."
"Demi there was no information in the BA email, just as stated PR waffle."

"“ Anthony anybody who has travelled with BA would have got that email”Mr bestcornishcat and I travel several times a year with BA, most recently in March. Neither of us got the email."
Have you taken your trip to London?
"Nearly all travel is by commercial mass transit, traveling this past thanksgiving to Dec 6th we made it just before the COVID 19 hit, and we had a fabulous time. However, now the Virus has spread all over Europe and especially the UK. I'd stay out of there the rest of 2020 and wait to see what next year brings. It was crazy how the crush of people would press into the TUBE, which can take you all over London. however everyone was breathing all over one another on each run. Similar situation on the Double-decker buses, just a lot of people crowding into a small space. Imagine 150 people on a typical bus, now you can understand what sardines look like in a can.....squeeeezed.. now you see the photos of the Tube it's empty and those few riders have their facemasks on, and I'm sure they feel oppressed by this virus and the after effects. If you go be very careful... I can't imagine everything is open either. Picaddily Square, Portobello Market and Camden Market at night were some of our favorites. as well as John Lewis Partners Mall on the London East Side. DONT MISS IT !!!!"
London has a lot more to offer than a shopping mall.
