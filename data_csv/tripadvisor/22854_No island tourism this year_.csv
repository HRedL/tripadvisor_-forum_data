"Aurigny have decided to cancel all flights ,except the vital Alderney and Southampton routes. What with the quarintene it looks like no tourism this summer? I was thinking of going in September but looks like even that might not be possible.https:/…"
I am guessing that would include ferries as well?
"Reading how the virus was managed by the islands is impressive.https:/…COVID-19_pandemic_in_GuernseyWith no new cases it isn't surprising that they want to keep it like that for a while. The ferries to date seem to be only on hold till summer. Why want the islands put at risk of having to go through this again as the virus bought back? Yes, financial hardship but alive and free to rebuild. Though they could introduce the 14 day quaratine idea if it could be policed."
"They do have a 14 day quarantine (at least in Guernsey and Alderney).Condor Ferries are currently scheduled to re-start in mid-June.And Guernsey has just announced that they are going to Phase 3 of the lockdown exit, ahead of schedule. See covid19.gov.ggEdited: 1:33 pm, May 15, 2020 "
"At the moment you can only get to the island if it's essential travel and that's unlikely to change anytime soon, except perhaps for people with a job offer in Guernsey. The ferries are due to start again in mid June however pretty much everyone is doubting if this is realistic. If they do restart, I would bet it's as passenger seats on the cargo ferry and still only for essential travel, as I know there's a number of people who need to drive their car back to Guernsey or the UK.There is talk of testing on departure/arrival combined with a shorter quarantine however this would be targeted towards Guernsey residents or the aforementioned job offer holders rather than for tourism purposes. Perhaps they'll use it for tourists later on but I think they're considering the risks of that to be too high for the foreseeable future."
Does anyone know where you stand with getting refunds from hotels / airlines if you are unable to get there?Normal travel insurance doesn't cover for pandemics unless you take out an add-on which of course we all did before this one came along!!
"I am amazed and enthralled by Isle of Man, which came to be noticed as I searched for the ability to own a gold coin from there with a cat on it. I adore and rescue cats. Nearing retirement age, this may appeal to us. My husband is really magic in his building & repairing abilities of anything & everything, electrical, water, dwellings, mechanics. My talents are medical, home making, cooking, baking, animal care, crafts & things of that sort. A main passion of my husband is cycling while mine is confined to the home or swimming & hiking. How may I learn about this wondrous place?"
"Marsharina, your retirement plans sounds like a plan to work, and that isn't always easy on the self-governing islands like Man:https:/…"
Suggest you post this on the Isle of Man forum.
Ask a resident!! What do you need to know?
"""Condor Ferries are currently scheduled to re-start in mid-June.""That's now moved to 1 September... and Aurigny have cancelled most flights until then too.The good news is that there have been no new cases in Guernsey for several weeks now, and still none at all in Alderney, and that some of the lockdown measures are being eased ahead of schedule - but not the 14 day quarantine which is likely to be one of the last things to go."
Does anyone know if Aurigny will refund fares if holidays aren't possible due to covid?
