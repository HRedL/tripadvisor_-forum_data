I realise there won't be a definitive answer to my question. But I was wondering what locals or expats living in Sri Lanka think the chances are of visiting Sri Lanka during the last 2 weeks of July. Possible? Unlikely? Highly Unlikely? Should I expect it to be cancelled? In which case I will concentrate on making other plans for later in the year (or next year).
"Some local hearsay said 'November as first broad chance, BUT earlier than that if a tourist can provide a recent certificate of being tested Covid-free'. Which is not obtainable for tourists in almost all countries as the tests are too scarce to be used for these kind of silly requirements.But every other hearsay can be different ;-)< Erik> & [Sandya]"
Chances of visiting Sri Lanka in July? Not very likely. Unless of course someone/country comes up with a miracle drug.
"Very very unlikely for July I would guess, unless the government is willing to take a big risk and allow tourists in which would be foolish. There is no way there will be a miracle drug - no such thing for a virus - drugs only help with symptoms - only a vaccine to stop infection and the earliest that will be available and widespread is 12 months from now. Sorry to be so negative. Hopefully hotels etc in Sri Lanka can do some business in the mean time from internal tourism.Stand strong Sri Lanka, you are beautiful, we will be back when we can!"
"what working vaccine you can get for a virus that already mutated and has few strains :) ?same ""working"" and ""good"" vaccine as for influenza virus?Just take care of yourself, of your immune system and deal with it - virus is already out.If you are not in high risk groups - which is mostly age and ongoing health issues - you will be fine.And you may be also grateful that its not a virus like Ebola-type...On the other hand - there are cases of 100 years old people actually having this pathogen and succesfully fighting it. But guess what - it is ""interesting"" that many of these guys had a harsh life before, like surviving crisis of 1929, hunger, later were fighting the ww2, active all the time etcNow you may ""wonder"" if locking down whole generation of healthy people at homes will actually make that generation stronger or weaker...."
"Totally agree with #4. But tell that to the authorities, in Lanka and abroad. And for the democratic countries also to their voters, as the useless fear mongering comes as much from them as from official channels...< Erik> & [Sandya]PS useful local perspectivehttps:/…Edited: 12:20 am, April 30, 2020 "
"for now the only hope i have is that it goes the same way the coronavirus SARS did, which started in November 2002, and it did it's full damage for a 6-7 months, and then when July 2003 came, it ""died down""... and the outbreak was officially over (and the following months: very few cases were reported, but they were researchers/medical staff who worked in labs on the virus etc, not the general public).So if this coronavirus goes the same way, then come July all this will be over, and by September we will be going back to ""business as usual""....but all that is based on ""hope"". Worst case scenario: it goes on and on, and we will be able to travel only by December: masks, gloves and ""certificates"" in hand... lets hope it does not come to that."
As usual #4 is sprouting nonsense.
"#7, Thanks for providing lots of valuable arguments for your ""thesis"".Nonsense is what the world does because of the virus with an average mortality rate of 0.2 % among population under 65 and without permanent health conditions.You know that Sri Lanka is #1 in the world when it goes to suicide numbers/ per 1000 people? It's actually around 20 people per day!What you think, because of economic problems due to curfew, lockdowns and tourists stopping coming to this country (even less money), this number will increase or decrease?Yes, I know that you didn't think about it..."
"This is principally a travel forum, even though there is not much travel happening, not a place for crazy medical theories, we can leave those to that orange guy in the White House. Those of us with a modicum of sense are well aware of the awful effect that covid is having worldwide, even if we are not directly effected ourselves - my niece is working in a hospital in central London full of dying patients and has to ring relatives every day to tell them bad news, so please do not make out like this is not a serious situation and does not warrant border closures, if it were to become very prevalent in Sri Lanka it would be a huge tragedy and there would be enormous loss of life.We all hope for the sake of Sri Lankans that the situation is resolved as soon as possible so that those who depend on tourism for their income can do so again.Looking forward to visiting your beautiful country and people as soon as possible."

"Back to politics and health discussions, are we?!While still keeping my ""social distancing"" to those two, my post is only to correct misinformation given in post #8 related to number of suicides in Sri Lanka:https://tinyurl.com/ybltoqpoOfficial data found on page 72. For whoever does not want to read, in year 2017 there were 3263 suicides in Sri Lanka, which averages to 8,94 per day (and not 20 / day as posted in post #8).Every thesis or ""thesis"" should be backed up with actual data, not heresays. To use your words, wroclaw...., I know that you didn't think about it ... to check your data at available official sources.Edited: 6:55 am, April 30, 2020 "
"Well I don't want to add to that discussion as we've traded similar opinions earlier. But as many (prospective) tourists want to understand the country and the background of the specific situation there which does impact travel/tourism a lot, another useful link with IMHO fair advices to the local public and authorities.ft.lk/columns/…4-699499< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"It is not mine to comment on that article, but I actually agree with all 8 points! Yet, the article does not discuss the opening of the borders to incoming visitors/travellers, or any other measure related to tourism, which would be the only point why linking it would be relevant to this travel-related forum.How and why each country is fighting the war with the virus is and should be the internal matter of each government and its citizens.What is the right way or the wrong way of combatting the pandemic is not and should not be the topic of this forum. Let us leave this to professionals (we two made that error a few weeks ago, and time told us some lessons).A travel related reply to the OP question is that only the actual pandemic situation in the world and government's decision will have the answer in due time."
"Thank you for your honest opinions and some insights into what is going on locally. If we have to postpone our trip to next year, which time of year is generally better weatherwise - April or July? We would like to visit the cultural triangle, Ella, Pasikuda, Yala National Park and Galle + a couple of nights on the coast in Tangalle."
"to #12This is from where I took my suicide numbers.https:/…sri-lankaSite looks quite reliable, isnt it...10 per day or 20 per day...Now, how many people died because of this deadly virus in Sri Lanka in last few months?You realize that every day around 150 K people die worldwide? Because of many reasons...if someone is 92 or 85 years old, has ongoing hypertension since 20 years, heart after 2 surgeries, and will catch the flu, ekhm pardon CORONAVIRUS, will it be really only that virus' fault that this person died?So funny to see (almost) everyone wearing mask here in Sri Lanka, guess what, it probably wont help that much with terrible quality of air in many places in this country...And air pollution leads to many diseases too...Who cares? Nobody cares! Nobody never cared!But but but CORONA!Edited: 9:13 am, May 01, 2020 "
To #15: April is better for Galle and July for Pasikudah. So it really depends on what you want to see there.https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29396…< Erik>
It's a trick one as I would like to visit both. Which month is better overall? How does August compare?
"We have done those (apart Pasikudah) in August, and have been lucky to have great weather most of the time. However ours was not having any beach time, if beach is important then follow link given by Erik in post #17."
Passikudah is good during July to September. Galle is good any time of the year since there is really no proper beach there and you will not plan to get into sea at Galle. The real beaches south of Galle are swimmable from December to early May.
"Do you want to swim at both beach locations? April is the shoulder season for both coasts, but with some luck you'd be able get some swimming in the south and west coast.July is usually busy everywhere, with a lot of people on their summer holidays. You definitely won't be able to swim in Tangalle but should be be fine for Passikudah."
"Provided we have a decent pool, swimming in the sea is not that important. Which time of year is better for Yala, Kandy and Ella?"
I'd say April is slightly better for those.< Erik>
"If you plan on April make it the first two weeks. After April 13, the vacation spots get really crowded as locals take their vacations after the Sinhalese and Tamil New Year."
It would have to be whenever the Easter school holidays are as I am a teacher.
"You will find it difficult to find accommodation if you travel just after mid April. If that is the only time you can travel, book your hotels early."
"Highly unlikely. We have been stuck in Sri Lanka since 19 March and if you use Singapore Air (Silk Air) as a guide they have cancelled all flights through end of June and possibly longer to Sri Lanka. That being said, if you could travel here as soon as it opens, the kind and friendly local people would love you for visiting their wonderful country."
As my recommendation do not plan your travel days at this moment. even at the moment the country is with curfew and it will takes another few weeks to get a result when will be the countries open. and all regular international flight schedules has closed. The Government will announce soon when is the airport open and international flights will be active as normal. there are not travelers who arriving to the country at the moment. as my advice please hold your decision if you’re planning to Sri Lanka tour for another few weeks.
"if you can pick when to go on holiday, then for me the absolute best months are February and June, very less tourists around, low risk of bad weather all around the island, and great for the local fauna..."
"Yes that is good advice. But according to all current newspaper reports the plans to re-allow tourism are coupled with the requirement that tourist obtain a certificate of being tested Covid-free before travelling. And according to all info I get from news sources around the world, the availability of those tests anywhere soon _for tourists_ (instead of for high-prio needs like healthcare staff, other government officials, prospective patients) is a huge issue for any foreseeable future.Hence even if Lanka opens, if they put requirments on e.g. UK or German or Ozzie or Indian tourists which for the current situations in those countries are downright silly it won't be of much help...< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"as i mentioned earlier, my hope is that come July all this will be over and we will slowly go back to normal, but if it were to come to ""worst case scenario"" and goes on and on, then i won't be going anywhere on holiday with medical certificates, except back home to Sri Lanka to visit my parents.fingers crossed."
A medical certificate saying that you are covid19 free is only good at the time if the test. An hour after the test you can get exposed and can be positive after that. Only way a certificate can work is if it shows that you were exposed in the past and now carry antibodies so you are not a spreader of the virus.
I cancelled my Septemner holiday in Sri Lanka and have re-booked for mid November. Just keeping my fingers crossed.
Marilyn: fingers crossed!
I thinkt there is a 80 % chance you cvan go
"Thank you, 80 percent sounds hopeful."
Udo Hagemann are you referring to July? Do you think it's 80% likely we can travel then? Or is your response referring to someone else's contribution?
"I really don't think Sri Lanka (or any other country) will be fully open for traveling this summer.Edited: 10:59 pm, May 07, 2020 "
I think the 80% referred to my post about visiting in November 2020.
"Sri Lanka Government has officially annouced to re open Sri Lanka Tourism back with new procediours and rules,They did not announce when they will open but they have been said that they will re open it soon Use the link below to see what are the rules and procediourshttps:/…"
"Well the content is a huge relief, as nowhere (unlike all earlier press releases) they talk about the tourist needing a COVID free certificate before getting the visa or before arriving. These are quite hard to get worldwide, most countries decide that due to scarcity of testing outbound tourists are not at all a priority getting this (and IOHO that makes sense).But let's hope that the policy stays as this PDF says (and thet I did not miss something)...< Erik> & [Sandya]"
chapter 1.3 states:Negative PCR report or positive anti body test report taken two weeks prior to landing in Sri Lanka to be uploaded with the visa application or produced at the Colombo Airport on arrival.Also you need to wear masks and gloves in the taxi/car.No use of public transportI guess we will pospone our trip to next year hoping things will be more normal by then.
"Okay, sorry I missed that.A showstopper for most countries; those tests are just not available to outbound tourists due to the scarcity (and priority), not even talking about the extra cost.This is no way unique to Sri Lanka, it's a worldwide issue, but it's a silly requirement and will hardly help starting up inbound tourism again... :-(< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"I agree. I dont see much (if any) international traveling happening this year. At least not for leisure. Aside from being allowed into the country, if I spend 5K on a holiday I want to make te most out of it and with all these (understandable) rules&regulations that’s not going to work for us."
That link on the Sri Lankan government on opening the country for tourism is just a draft proposal for discussion. Those are not the real requirements which not formulated yet.
"Yes checked for Netherlands. The PCR test is simply not available, also not from private clinics, if the person is not working in medical profession or is suspected of Covid. The antibody test is available from private clinics, prices I found range from 100-200 euro, but the issue is that Lanka (and maybe other countries to) wants to require a POSITIVE test: proof that you have had Corona and now are immune. So the tourist first spends a lot of money and then if it's found out you have not had Corona you can still not enter :-(So indeed, for most Europeans it'll be no long distance travel; only some within-EU holidaying but even for that the rules still have to be made. And Indiands and Chinese, major markets for Lankan tourism, probably also refuse to come with these silly medical requirements...< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"The proposals also require updated PCR records to be available and kept with most tourist industry workers, no tourists allowed in public transport service, and a bunch of others that are simply not practical and not available in the country. This looks like just an academic exercise. Unless a vaccine becomes available soon, the world as we knew is simply gone. People will not travel long distances for pleasure. Even if they want to, the costs will be prohibitive for most average people. Countries that depend on tourism will have to rethink their strategies."
"As already mentioned by Erik, the only reasonable document would be the positive serology/antibody test. Everything else is just useless as one can get infected on the exit door of that same facility the person has been tested. Two weeks are an eternity in today situation.Vaccine will be available, eventually (not a fact just an opinion). And there is always hope that virus will mutate into a less dangerous strain. Until such time, let's get to know the home and the homeland :-)) .Edited: 11:39 am, May 08, 2020 "
"My concern about visitng SL again (as I would dearly like to do) is not the risk of catching the virus there, but rather more the hazards of spending 10-12 hours in an airborn cigar tube in close proximity to a large number of other travellers. That's a situation which will not be safe IMHO until there is an effective vaccine, and that will be some time yet. When it is, it would be sensible for some form of certificate to be issued after vaccination before travel or entry is permitted."
"That is one approach. Another one at least from the Lankan side is not to put requirements on tourists which basically under present circumstances cannot be fulfilled, like the PCR test.It's in the end a subjective choice of the local authorities. But at least they should stop misleading their own people (esp. the tourist industry) and maybe even some tourists that the current plan will be of any help. Unless they would explain how to get a PCR test in e.g. USA, Canada, Europe, India, China, Oz... (The blood test as mentioned above generally can be bought but does not make sense unless the prospective tourists knows that (s)he had Corona and needs proof. Buying the test and then hearing that you are Corona free and did not have it still does not allow entry into Lanka with the current proposal...) Local hotels are already investing quite a lot in making their facilities Corona-proof, and if the borders are not opened up under reasonable rules (and instead the industry has to wait for a vaccine, if it comes at all, for tourists to enter Sri Lanka) then that is only more and more wasted money...< Erik> & [Sandya]"
The recovery from the virus has two sides. Sri Lanka can do everything they want but if the people are not ready to travel all that Sri Lanka do will be for nothing.
"Agree. But at least a percentage of travellers will not care too much about the safety in planes etc and will just want to come when rules allow it. So let's at least hope for rules that make sense, the current proposed list is simily unworkable. Unless someone or even the authorities point out where in the main countries for tourists this testing can be done in any foreseeable future. My expectation (no proof...) is that slowly quite a few countries will open up with _workable_ rules and will push Lanka out of the tourist market for the near future....< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"July?No, I don't think so. it's better to wait two or three months. It is not even ready to open Sri Lanka for tourism still. And also the vulnerability of Covid is still there."
"Well, our flight for 19th July has now been cancelled, so I've got my answer, we won't be going this year. Will try to rebook for next year!"
"Who were you due to fly with?This is one of the reasons I think holidays to Sri Lanka will struggle when restrictions are finally lifted.I am able to book a package holiday leaving on the very same day July 19th, infact up until yesterday I was able to book a holiday to Sri Lanka leaving on Sunday ......yes Sunday 17th may , the holiday company knew full well the holiday would not go ahead , but were still willing to take my money. This is with no visas being issued to uk nationals by Sri Lanka , no insurance available and restrictions on flying imposed by the foreign office., but will take your money anywayI think the way the holiday industry in general , especially in theUK , have treated customers will deter many people from booking , certainly many months in advance.People may book last minute, which goes against the business model the holiday industry uses, so expect prices to dramatically increase, and if Sri Lanka want to chase high spending individuals then a family holiday will be way out of reach of most people"
We were due to fly with Qatar from Birmingham but had booked many months ago.
"I booked last sept to go on 17th March and return just after Easter. The tour operator cancelled on the 15th , when Sri Lanka suspended flights from the UK, I did get my money back eventually but it took well over a month, but all the time they were still selling holidays to the island and indeed are still doing it , despite restrictions on travel.I’m prepared to jump through whatever hoops Sri Lanka impose on any future travel, as I love the place, but will have severe reservations about booking through a travel agent or airline, when the customers have been treated in such a despicable manner recently, and. I think other people will behave the same, in that you may or may not get your money back if things go wrong"
"#54very interesting as for the flight cancelled for 19th July.Speculation: so it means that the airport wont be fully operational till that time?That would be really bad, as i don't want to be stuck here for life haha or overpay for Sri Lankan Airlines flights (they recent ""new"" prices are 2.5 times more than before for flights to Dubai for example)"
"As far as I understand the Birmingham - Doha flight has been cancelled. So it may be different from other (bigger) UK airports. As regards Stephenr's comment, my husband is a travel professional but as I understand his company will not accept any new bookings with departure dates before October. The customers my husband's company deals with are made fully aware of the current travel advice, insurance restrictions etc. If they wish to go against this advice or have a pressing reason to travel then that is up to them, It is the airlines that take ages to refund your money, with some (i.e. Emirates) even trying to hold on to it for an entire year! But I suppose yes, you will get travel agents who will still sell you trips for this June/July but they are obviously desperate not to go out of business, travel businesses operate with small margins at the best of times.Edited: 7:48 am, May 12, 2020 "
"Good to here the are some professionals out there, however a quick scan on the ITA Matrix sees flights from LHR on June1st, from several major airlines, Oman, Qatar and Sri Lankan albeit at eye watering pricesThe main reason tour operators are struggling though is due to their business model.I paid the tour operator in Sept 2019 for my holiday in March 2020, that some of money did not pay for my trip, it paid for someone else to go on holiday later on in September, thats the main reason tour operators, are struggling to pay back what the law says they should, they simply dont have the cash to hand and the consumer is suffering But like I said its good to see there are professional operators out there, maybe drop me a d.m as I quite fancy a month or so looking around India when this is all overBest of luck in the future with your business as travel is going to be one of the worst hit industries"
"Yes, still I believe that the percentage (80) is OK. The Sri Lankan Government has done really well so far!"
Well maybe earlier. BUT what requirements they wlll put on arrvving visitors is unclear here. If it's the impossible Covid tests abroad or compulsory 14 day quarantaine it won't help much...https:/…< Erik> & [Sandya]
"According to my personal assessment In Sri Lanka, people are very keen to bring tourists back to the country quickly! I repeat myself: the information issued by the government on new infections etc. make me optimistic"
According to our government sri lanka will open end of July with number of safety instructions. Tourism have to face two week checking period for covid 19 in sri lanka but don't worry as per the government they will provide you transport in this period.
"Well let's await the details.If they mean '2 week quarantaine, stay in/around hotel during that time' it'll be a showstopper for 99% of the tourists. Even if they can come without the, hard to get, Corona checking at home.If they mean 'usual excursions and round tours are possible but the government-approved and well-cleaned car-driver companies will have to transport you', yes it might work in getting some tourists (not the backpackers clearly). Supposing that the tourists still can e.g. climb Sigiriya, enter Temple of Tooth etc etc. But those liberties mean quite some loss of the 'isolated cocoon' thinking behind the safety measures, and always mean some more risk of spreading the virus. (Whether that risk was/is exaggerated large scale in Lanka and anywhere else is another discussion, not for here and now.)So let's wait and see what comes up...Tnx for sharing,< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"You can be absolutely certain that no one will come as a tourist to Sri Lanka if they have to go through a 14-day quarantine period in the beginning. That is simply crazy. So for two weeks of vacation, you have to add another two weeks? These people have lives, they have jobs to go to, they have families to look after, hundreds of other things to do. As an ex-pat that has lots of family in Sri Lanka, I would not even consider coming if that is what I have to go through.Edited: 6:10 pm, May 15, 2020 "
Rescheduled my September holiday till mid November but now thinking that will not be possible.Sri Lanka will still be there next year but so worried about their economy.
I think the government of Sri Lanka should not wait too long giving binding info regarding opening of the airport and the rules for incoming tourists. As for me it is clear that they can forget about tourists as long as they have to go through a 14-day quarantine!
"And the pressure is on; according to latest info all EU nationalities can freely travel as tourists to Italy after June 3rd. (However they might not always be able to return to their own country without quarantaine ;-), and filight availability is also limited. So in the global competition that exists for tourists, Asian and other countries should also at least give timelines...< Erik> & [Sandya]"
According to the SLTDA (Tourism Authority) chair person goverment is planning to open the country for the foriegn tourists around month of July if the things will continue smoothly. Islandwide curfew mostlikely to shift from June 1st onwards.
"Well seems like this oneft.lk/front-page/…44-700290which won't fly at all:* 2 weeks extra needed for the quarantaine period (but okay it's at a 4 star and free)* PCR test needed before flying. In e.g. Poland these seem to be available (100 euro), in Western Europe including UK and France simply not. Too scarce to allow usage for tourists, they are restricted to e.g. medical staff and teachers.< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"""Travellers will be subject to a two-week quarantine at four- or five-star hotel or at a Government facility free-of-charge."" - if I would be interested in such type of tourism (All-inclusive) Sri Lanka would be on top of my travel list. However, what would be the economical reason for giving away a 2 weeks of free holidays if that is probably on the upper range of an average tourists stay in the country?Edited: 7:19 am, May 17, 2020 "
"The government is delusional if it think that tourists will agree to two-weeks of quarantine before they start a tour of the island, or that there are thousands of tourists from India who travel in private planes."
"Yes it's silly and hypohethical. Won't help the tourism much.As for ""However, what would be the economical reason for giving away a 2 weeks of free holidays if that is probably on the upper range of an average tourists stay in the country?""well it's just another kind of subsidy. By paying those 4 stars (if the travelller gets them - expat Lankans probably get a far more basic Army Camp!) an amount per day, not much more than their basic costs, government does not need to pay them for furloughing the hotel staff. Insofar those subsidies exist at all, as a developing country Lanka hardly has social security. And government this way can expect the hotels etc. to make some money from the time beyond 2 weeks that the tourists come, in the end leading to them paying their taxes (next to the ETA fee, airport tax etc. coming from the arrival). Whether it's worth it economically - no idea. But their expectations of this attracting tourists (esp. China and India generally come for 7 days only as they don't have more holidays there) - a Fata Morgana to explain the local crowds and maybe later make them accept a more workable (but always, essentially, more health risks bringing) poilcy?< Erik> & {Sandya]"
"Indeed, government(s) moves in mysterious ways."
"I like the sound of the 5 year long stay visa though that’s a game changer for me , no I’m not a high end tourist , but someone close enough to retirement so for me that’s great.Regarding the 14 day ‘free’ accommodation at four or even five star hotels ,I usually stay on the island for between 3 and 4 weeks, so an additional 2 weeks free of charge will be no hardship...........plus an additional two weeks probable quarantine on my return to the uk.As an aside this’ free’ accommodation in Sri Lanka, could it possibly be subsided by SriLankan air fares?I’m looking at flights right now from Heathrow and they are literally double every other carrier. And in December I’ve flown business class with them for less than the price they are charging for economyI know SriLankan are usually a little more expensive than the others but double is something I’ve not seen before"
"Okay, if people take the plans of the 2-week luxury quarantaine a bit serious here some lessons learnt about the current one. (Mainly in Sinhalese media, credits to Sandya).* Since late March or so, both due to overloading of the army camps and complaints from locals with enough money, the option of certain 4-stars is given there too. Those hotels very likely also play a role in the new proposal.* Cost Rs 7500/day, to be paid oneself. Full board; probably on (twin) room sharing basis.* And of course better facilities, e.g. wifi and pool, than in the army camps* But as the local media tells even that is not enough - spoilt student-age kids of a wealthy local (you guessed it, with questions on how he got his wealth) repatriated from London. And complained about their stay in 4 star Citrus Kalutara hotel that it was 'not comfortable enough' ;-)[Sandya] & "
"""But as the local media tells even that is not enough - spoilt student-age kids of a wealthy local (you guessed it, with questions on how he got his wealth) repatriated from London. And complained about their stay in 4 star Citrus Kalutara hotel that it was 'not comfortable enough""1) First of all, can you provide the source of this information?2) Second, under what circumstance are you questioning his/her/their source of wealth? Are you saying that wealthy people never obtain their wealth from honest means and that honest people are always dirt poor? Oh I'm under no illusions. There are indeed shady individuals who have made fortunes (around the world in fact), but what right do you have to make a serious accusation like that against a random person just because he/she/ is rich?"
"#78: I would guess (yes guess!) that most new-rich or new-money in Colombo has been obtained by fraudulent means, at least playing loose and fast with rules and regulations. Definitely with political connections that allow favors."
"Yes. As the suspicion is in the vast majority of the cases true, I won't spend too much time in finding Scoob a Sinhalese source which he probably won't easily get a translation for. The father was a governor of the Central Bank, which is a government job and hence generally cannot explain sending the kids to study in London ;-)< Erik>PS Citrus hotel is quite enough quality for me and most other tourists, and if it is not with these 'local' kids there is not only something quite wrong with their father but also with them..."
"To be fair to the government-run quarantine centers, the majority of the people who were taken to those, that includes a few foreigners, were very complimentary about the services and the facilities. This was apparent from the post-quarantine interviews they gave to the local media. It was only a few that were complaining loudly.Edited: 11:36 am, May 18, 2020 "
"Yes agree. And for some people not even the paid hotels were not good enough, as shown above ;-)< Erik> & [Sandya]"
The content of the last comments tells me that I no longer get into this forum. Best wishes
"Point taken, the discussion drifted off a bit from pure travel advice.But bottom line remains that the current proposals are ridiculous and silly and won't help tourism for a dime. In the quarantaine (now already 3 Meditteranean-European tourist countries are opening borders for EU citizens, without quarantaine, in June-July) and in the silly requirement that tourists should test for Covid at home while in most countries these tests are simply not available for average citizens/tourists.So the ridicule is partly self-inflicted by the authorities (not only the Lankan ones, it happens at more places...).< Erik> & [Sandya]"
Which countries are opening for tourism?
"Italy June 3rd, Spain 'late June - early July' and tiny Slovenia May 31st. Note: only for EU tourists, not yet for outside EU (that EU wide ban is now until June 15th).Mediterranean countries up to some extent (beach centric tourism) are quite a competitor to Sri Lanka and similar tropical countries, so the tropical countries should better get their act together instead of being quite slow...< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"UK, currently open to everyoneAustria, Belgium aiming for 15 th JuneCyprus between 9th and 13th JuneGreece aiming for 1st JulyHolland already open to Schengen countries (eric will correct me if I am wrong)Italy due to reopen on 3rd JuneNo word on Spain yet , but Portugal will open again shortly so expect Spain to follow soon afterwardsTravel restrictions are often changing on a daily basisso keep checking folks"
sorry last post should have read England not the UK
"Well, good that those countries feel confident about opening up for tourism. However Sri Lanka does not have to open just because they are. It is not a race. Get it right. People who wanted to come to SL will come eventually. I think it is more important to act in cooperation with other countries in the region rather than rush to open simply because Southern Europe is opening.Edited: 5:28 pm, May 18, 2020 "
Yes and no/. Tourism is global competition...< Erik> & [Sandya]
"Hmm..I missed out on this irrelevant chatter.But I have to say that the story in #80 was a popular item of fake news. I know of a couple of people who got quarantined at hotels, and they've liked it. Seems to be the general vibe in Colombo."
"Okay I'll ask Sandya, the source through which we got #80, to check the Sinhalese media for fake news. Not an easy task ;-)< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"Another update:https:/…If these guys got it right, the quarantaine requirement is dropped. (But the PCR requirement, silly for many major Western countries of their clients because these are in short supply and not available there for tourists, remains).< Erik> & [Sandya]PS On the real-or-fake-news story on spoilt kids disliking their stay in a 4-star: if it was fake it was well-done fake, as the Sinhalese paper publishing the story had pics of the Citrus hotel and of the kids there..."
"And some more research on the compulsory-it-seems PCR test, if that requirement goes ahead. Intermediate conclusion: with current knowledge this testing (twice - upon booking the trip and 14 days before flying to get the visa) is a huge extra cost for tourists, hence it would really restrict the border opening to wealthy tourists. (But see the various other posts, by e.g. not allowing public transport usage and forcing 3-4 star hotels and expensive car-driver it directs to that market segment anyhow. Not e.g. to Indian or Chinese group tourists...).* Poland: private clinic, around 100 Euro* UK: for tourists available at private hospitals for around 200 pound* USA: ditto, around 200 USD upwardsNote that both UK and USA the test is free/covered by insurance if the GP refers you due to possible symptoms, but that is quite a different usage than for a tourist visa ;-)* And tiny Netherlands: 'under discussion' whether, as now, it's only on GP referral or freely available to everyone who wants to get tested for society's sake (and paid by the insurance).Good luck all,< Erik> & [Sandya]"
Minor correction to Post #94: Chinese tourists are not poor by anyone's standard. It is just that because of language issues they tend to travel in organized tour groups.
In even tinier Slovenia both tests are available; swab for 93 Eur and antibodies for 25 Eur. Out of the pocket. Still less expensive then some countries' visas.
"Yes agree, Chinese tourists (unlike many of the Indian ones) tend to use 3-4 star hotels. the cost for PCR test there if available could be workable for them. So if current plans go ahead, some upmarket European/Western tourists and Chinese groups could be the first one to bite ;-)< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"@93. Of course they are ""well done fakes"". Easy trigger points for anyone who is infuriated by that stereotype.In principle, it's understandable - and acceptable - for you to be annoyed by these stories. But if you're to be pedantic about the facts, there are loads of them. I'll list a couple, regarding the whole ""studying in England"" thing and being spoiled by the new riches.1. The kids did study overseas. Even before he had a Govt appointment. They graduated eons ago2. There was fake news claiming his daughter made a huge fuss. But he doesn't have a daughter3. Citrus is owned by Government cronies. It has nothing but high praise from its higher ups.But all this is well known in Colombo. I guess most of the fake news sticks around outside Colombo"
"As for the ""test requirement"", it seems that its just better to get infected with that ""horrifying and deadly"" virus, GET WELL after 1-2 weeks, have antibodies and laugh at every overzealous officer and burreacrat out there.[That of course, if you are under 70-80 years old and without existing serious health conditions]I seriously don't know what difference does it make ""negative test result"" from the last 24-48 hours,as if you can get infected at any time later.Yet another try to ""feel good method"" because of the illusions of control.Of course, as for the antibodies test, I head that there are few types of sars-cov-2 already, so it would mean that this test is kind of useless too... Just like for the flu.Edited: 12:38 am, May 25, 2020 "
"Yes you can argue a lot about the relation between the proposed measures and what they aim/claim to accomplish. But never mind, we're here to advice travellers based on the legal boundaries, and if these will become as announced they'd be workable (but expensive) for a segment of the tourists.Assuming one does not think one has had Covid, an antibody test would be useless. So that's two PCR tests (one before booking and one within 2 weeks before departure; latter is needed for the visa). And either a changeable/refundable flight ticket rate or a travel insurance covering Covid risk for new bookings. The latter is quite rare to find (and possibly costs as much as the price difference between cheaper ticket and a refundable ticket)…< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"#99 it surely is better if one gets well after being invected with COVID-19, no doubts about that part. However, not everyone under the age of 70-80 (and younger!) is lucky enough to do get well as this is indeed a horrifying and deadly virus. So what you are suggesting to travellers is neither wise nor safe. And since you are repeating that phrase ""just like a flu"" ... no, it is not just like a flu. BTW, have you followed your own advice? Whatever travel requirements by Sri Lanka will be in the future, visitors will have to follow them. And of course, they will also have to follow the related health requirements from their own country."
It seems as they will open up restaurants this week. And most locals visit hotels for restaurants
"#101 good luck with being horrified and scared.I won't deprive you from the right to be like that :-)Edited: 8:36 am, May 25, 2020 "
"#101, anyone who is saying ""this is just like the flu"" is being totally ignorant and totally selfish. Even if it does not affect most young that severely, they can infect their older mothers, fathers, grandparents, and others with that stupid attitude."
"Laviniam, I share your thoughts 100%. It is poster of post #99 that is (repeatedly and wrongly) comparing COVID-19 to other flu-related viruses.If self-driving in Sri Lanka was described as ""playing a Russian roulette"", what will be the description of this statement ""... that its just better to get infected ...""??"

"Well the whole discussion on how appropriate the measures and rules of authorities, including the Lankan ones, are not very relevant now. Let's await the real rules for opening up (though commenting on the current drafts is useful, in terms of tourism impact), AFTER that we can debate again between 'travel as much as possible within the legal boundaries' or 'do not travel until there is a vaccine or cure, and do especially not travel by plane' as extremes.And our opinion in that round can be predicted from the past (and from being amongst the first wave of foreign tourists into Germany next week, from the EU): as much as possible, as there are lots of exaggerations, overreactins and wrong lockdown plans around.< Erik> & [Sandya]"

Some updates....themorning.lk/hotels-to-open-for-locals-befo…< Erik>
There should be some more announcements this weekhttps://tinyurl.com/yc8hzhk4
"Following on post #107, my personal opinion is yes to 'travel as much as possible within the legal boundaries' but adding ""preferably within your country of residence for time being ""."
"....and there we disagree, because I find that addition plain wrong. But that's a discussion for the later future then, when e.g. Lanka formally opens up again for tourists.< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"People should travel when it is safe to do so, not because a govt wants you to. For example, it would be silly to travel to Brazil right at this point, despite what the government there is saying."
"Agree, But also the other way round - our trip to Germany next week is allowed by German authorities, but officially still 'discouraged' by the Netherlands ones. They are slow in updating their advices.But we ourselves, based on our research of the situation and of course also asking in TA Germany forum, decide to travel...< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"Okay Aug-1 might be the date. But if by then all nationalities are allowed, with exactly which requirements (like the PCR test, only poshpacking etc etc), still in a crystal ball...https:/…"
"Of course you would disagree, Erik. But I have only added my personal opinion, ... and I have not disagreed with yours, and not even with comment that ""there are lots of exaggerations, overreactins and wrong lockdown plans around."" Your opinion is valid and my opinion is valid and why would we need to disagree each and every time?!BTW you can also visit Slovenia. To cross the border you would need to have the confirmed reservation for your accommodation. Slovenia apparently has better situation then many other EU countries, based on available published data. And weather is lovely! Our airport is opened from May 13th but still no commercial flights. Opening the airport is only the first step of many to reignite the international tourism. Hopefully Sri Lanka will walk faster through those steps."
"Yes your airport flights were the problem. Starting mid June or so, whilst we have the holiday booked first weeks of June. Also Sandya is slightly scared of flying now, but we'll bite that bullet with some long weekend in Europe later this summer before, if all rules work out well, we can fly intercontinental again this fall.Tnx,< Erik> & [Sandya]"
August 1st is now indeed the official date that they are hoping to re-open the airport.
"according to the news (also on the radio yesterday) they are hoping to reopen for tourism starting from 01 August.https:/…Edited: 12:10 am, May 27, 2020 "
"It's getting closer and closer.An interesting related question from a tourists in another forum (need to rephrase as it was in Dutch)'We have a holiday booked for August, with public transport and hostels. What to do with it as the borders DO open (probably), flight DOES go (probably), but with new visa rules my trip still cannot go ahead?'Answer1. Check with airline whether due to the new visa rules they still allow postponing your trip, or change to a more train-friendly destination.2. If they don't allow, resort to your travel insurance. (It would not pay out if the airline offered something, then the insurance tells you to use that).3. And if you did not take insurance with cancellation coverage (of course from pre-Corona times, since March that cover is unavailable in most cases) it was your risk. Sorry.All the best,< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"So no reasonably priced OUTBOUND flights from Colombo until August 1st?Perfect, just perfect :("
"How much is a reasonably priced flight? From what I've heard, there isn't much demand or interest in flying out. The few exceptions are willing to pay the premium"
"Well, maybe - except these 10,000 foreigners that are stuck in Sri Lanka, there are actually some Sri Lankas that want to go to work abroad?Reasonable is the old normal price, like up to 200 euros to UAE for example."

"Ah yes, the idiots who didn't want to get out. There were about 75000 tourists at the time of the lockdown. And most of them managed to get repatriation flights back. They - and people involved with the repatriation - were the only ones who were allowed to move around and work during the height of the curfew.But there are quite a few business owners and expats, registered as tourists, who chose to stay here as this is their second (or possibly the first) home. That's understandbleThere were also a large number of Indian workers registered as tourists. This counts for the majority of your 10000. Lots of of the Polish here lost their jobs, and most of them flew back in March. And I don't think they will come back till the economy/tourism kicks backEdited: 12:28 am, May 28, 2020 "
"Well tourists should be glad they are only allowed in a bit later (Aug-1?). The hotels and their restaurants have reopened recently for locals, after the 2-month curfew period who forced many of them to close fully.A Colombo friend immediately grabbed the opportunity to dine with others (at 2 m distance) at a leading 5 star in Colombo - I'll withhold the name as it probably could happen with any of them. And got (I think) a la carte, not buffet.Came home with a serious food poisoning. The very likely cause: food that was put in the freezer in March due to the forced closure, and served now.Once tourists come in this 'guinea pig phase' should be over :-(< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"Thanks, Sandya and Erik for this update. Hopefully, if safe, my November holiday will go ahead."
"Same for us. Next booking for me is late Oct - early Nov with Swiss, lucky I booked it before Corona so _if_ my PCR test two weeks before flight would be blocking my travel insurance still pays back, but i'll have an interesting challenge booking all local hotels with a fully refundable option (with only certainty, and hopefully paying, within 14 days from flying).< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"Haven't heard of this incident yet. I dined lout last night without any issues.But most of the high end restaurants have been functioning throughout, on a takeaway basis. They've been quite busy with their limited menus."
"Now at least a 2nd source tells no 14 day quarantaine. No 100% certainty on all other issues however, not even whether it's August 1st.themorning.lk/when-tourists-arrive-in-the-co…< Erik>"
"From what's being mentioned, it seems that Aug 1 will be the tentative date and visitors are planned to be tested at the airport itself, and allowed to proceed with their travel if the tests are negative. Not sure whether the tourists are supposed to stay in the airport itself or isolated in nearby hotels till results come in presumably in a few hours or on who will bear the cost. Anyway, no guarantees that this will materialize, as with all things, it could change at the last moment on a whim. However, at least this seems a common sense way to move forward instead of mandatory quarantines or test certificates procured beforehand which become meaningless even after a few seconds of close contact or opening everything up completely from the get go.Edited: 7:30 pm, June 02, 2020 "
"Well your guess is as good as ours. I still read""“A negative PCR test when applying for a visa is a must. Once they arrive, they have to take another PCR test here as well""so it's still that for most countries not cheap (USD 100-200) test before you get the visa. And a refundable air ticket if you don't want to bear the risk of not being allowed to fly yourself (travel insurances do as a rule of thumb not cover Corona risk for any new booking).< Erik>"
Hi...August 01 open our Airport ...now sri lanka is safe country you can planing nowthanks
"Yes but awaiting LOTS of more details before people can decide. All mentioned in thread - e.g. public transport allowed yes/no (including scenic train ride), hostels allowed next to posh hotels, riding as passenger in cab or tuktuk next to the car-driver model, etc etcAnd a, to be expected, trend in some EU countries is: 'travel to outside EU including Lanka allowed, _but_ upon return from outside EU one must selfquarantaine for 14 days'...< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"Doors have been closed quickly but they will open slowly. Both the hosts and the guests will have to adapt themselves to the new rules and recommendations. It will took longer but eventually we travellers will be back. Surely not in the same numbers, and it will be times when good business practices in the past will yield results in the future."
Some hotels are opening up for local tourism this weekend.
"IIt's getting closer. Strangely not on SLTDA website, only on their FB page.https://www.facebook.com/sltda.gov.lk/?tn-str=k*F&hc_location=group_dialogMain points:* Visa fee USD 100* Need a PCR test at home 72 hours or less before flying* No public transport (and only selected hotels).* No clarity on many other things, like being allowed to be passenger in a tuktukRegards,< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"Well like you said before, what's the point of a 72 hour old test. Esp if they intend to do one on arrival. Either way, the hotels will get a head start and some practice with the locals and the government will get a bet idea of what to allow once things open up here. Public transport in general is suppose to resume from Monday"
"#137.Good luck with that!Also, what a perfect way to make some money on side for the government and its buddies... If ONLY there will be tourists willing to spend it that way :)"
"Also, to not be so harsh, I see one potentially positive thing there: long term multiple entry visa (max 6 months per entry). This one can be useful for many people I guess."
"They will get very few tourists, probably some tour groups from China and India. Given that covid19 is rampant in India with much control, I am not sure that SL would want people from India to travel there. No public transport means, the low end ""back-packers"" will not be there. So most of the less expensive homestays probably will stay closed. The airfare from North America are unbelievably high during the coming summer months, so there will not be many north-Americans traveling. Middle-east tourists are a possibility, but given the recent planeloads of sick people from there, do you want them to come?This will be the first time in many years that I am not planning to come to Sri Lanka. Sad."
"Yes agree. I _will_ be there in the fall, but that is partly due to the ticket being booked long before Covid. Anxiously awaiting more detail; not using public transport is doable, but fully avoiding using tuktuks gets challenging and of course need to visit our own Colombo house too. But majority of the nights would be in hotels anyhow, will discuss later with our travel agents exactly what the conditions/lists for the hotels are...< Erik> & [Sandya]PS Same info as on the sltda FB page now readable for everyonetravelvoice.lk/sri-lanka-tourism-ready-to-we…Edited: 2:23 pm, June 05, 2020 "
"I think that public transport is ""recommended to not be used"", not banned from being used.Big pain in the a... with MULTIPLE pcr tests. one before, one at landing, and two additional tests being in the country.This one looks like a killer of the tourism. Also - ""certified accomodation"" means that smaller guesthouses, which are the majority of accomodation here will have problems. And what a great idea for a gov to make even more money from local people and tax them (by ""certificates"") even more.Big money will make some money, small and medium money will be at losses or die.Anyway, Im happy cause I will be able to leave Lanka finally at normal airline prices :)maybe it will even happen before 1st August :)Edited: 10:19 pm, June 05, 2020 "
"Okay let's wait and see. ""Public transport should not be used."" is how the press release phrases it, no idea how strict this will be. As expats living in Lanka are of course exempt, those like us knowing a reasonable level of Sinhala won't need to be very afraid of this, but still....< Erik>"
"been discussing this in a couple of italian groups:- pay 100 USD for the visa - - pay 130 EUR to get a test done and certificate or you wont be allowed to board the flight- get a second test done after arriving (for free) - spend the first night in a 4 o 5 star hotel in Colombo o Negombo while waiting for test results (who pays?) - get a third test done after 5 days, - get a fourth test done after 10 days... Only those who have friends/lovers/family are willing to go through all that hassle, but not one tourist, literally not one ""real tourist"" wants to come in these conditions...can you blame them though?"
"In addition to above points, if that 2nd or 3rd test is positive, a (mandatory??) 14- or 21-day quarantine follows. Just too many obstacles for a ""general tourist"", IMO."
"xelas: and the worst part is, IF someone tests positive then ALL PASSENGERS who arrived on that flight are tracked down and taken in to quarantine, so even if you don't catch it or have it, your holiday may still be ruined because someone in your flight got it, so yes, way too many risks for a general tourist, i agree."
Shawn: that is a very good point about someone else being positive on your flight and you getting quarantined. I don't think think these rules are workable for tourists.
"Agree. And it's not the only country shooting it's own tourist industry in the foot this way.If the opening up of the borders for tourism within Europe proves to be succesful enough (no direct 2nd wave), it'll be proven that the reaction of Sri Lankan authorities (and quite a few other countries too) is an extreme overreaction.But let's wait and see, main purpose here is to help travellers that chose (or consider) Sri Lanka to travel within the legal constraints possible. Not to critise those constraints too much, the responsible people are not listening to us anyhow ;-)< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"After reading through the link posted by Eric, on travel voice, I think everyone seems to overlooking the fact that valid travel insurance is mandatory now (presumably because of the virus)?Well good luck with that one, in the UK all annual policies taken out before the outbreak and you should be covered.However trying to find an insurance company now that will include cover for Covid is impossible, and I expect if and when they do begin again to include Covid on their policy then the price will be prohibitive"
"Valid travel insurance?! I have never ever paid for the travel insurance, only for the medical insurance. Why is it mandatory now? Is it a state mandated condition to enter Sri Lanka now? Any links to the source?"
"My interterpretation of the text (it's same in all websites linked recently) is that you should proof medical insurance. Which is not mandatory for some nationalities in their home countries.Not additional insurance against e.g. theft, loss, cancellations; the cancellation coverage also for Corona is now almost impossible to get, and the normal theft/loss insurance often is void if people come to Lanka this summer while their own authorities still give a negative travel advice. But all of those don't matter to the Lankan authorities. They simply want to make sure that someone pays the hospital bill if a tourist ends up there with Covid or whatever other diseases.< Erik>"
"This version at leasttravelvoice.lk/sri-lanka-tourism-ready-to-we…quotes it as 'proof of medical insurance'. Should give enough certainty ;-) So post #150 quotes it wrongly, for UK people some proof of NHS coverage abroad is enough,E+SEdited: 2:42 pm, June 06, 2020 "
#Stayhome do yourself and others a big favour!
"This still needs some thought I think if they hope this will attract tourists.Sri Lanka has been more successful than most in containing the virus but there are risks with opening the borders that cannot be eradicated completely, so its a case of minimising the risk...I understood that the Sri Lankan government wanted to encourage longer stay tourists. This makes sense as once a tourist has been in the country for two weeks they present only the same level of risk as a local - hence minimising the risk. But to attract the longer term tourist insistance an insistance on 4 or 5 star hotels for the duration of the trip is not going to fly, except perhaps for the uber wealthy, and the smaller establishments in the tourist sector will not survive.Maybe a hybrid proposal is needed. Testing and restrictions on hotels and public transport for the first 14 days (perhaps a simplified version of the current proposal) but after that issue a certificate to the effect that you have been on the island for 14 days and as such are free to stay where you wish and use public transport etc.Those that want the reassurance of the high end certified hotels will continue on with those after the 14 days is up, others will be free to support the smaller establishments in the tourism sector or visit friends and family etc and spend their tourist money thoughout the local economy rather than a few select places.But the whole world is trying to figure this out, I think it will come together in time...Edited: 9:20 pm, June 06, 2020 "
"My bet is that this is just temporary protocol for the next few months.People and countries will get back to their common sense (those that kind of lost it) very soon.Unless there is/ this is a coming/crawling worldwide ""change"" of basic universal income for everyone and ""one government and monetary system for all"" :-)Also, the possible fact of soon - slowly dying and fading out virus of ""Black Death"" (forgive me my terrible sarcasm,I'm such a terrible man, oh no it's sarcasm again) in the next months will definitely help in coming back to casual, common sense. The first ""step"" in good direction is a fading mass media coverage. I hope so at least!"
"Thanks Erik, for reply and link. Yes, medical insurance only is what I have understood by reading that same page. Not so sure that all countries will get back to their common way very soon, at least not all of them. COVID-19 pandemic is still in effect. ""Casual"" and ""common sense"" are not working hand-in-hand in these times. Majority of world countries have adopted the same approach towards fighting with the virus, and thus preventing the lives of their citizens. Some have opted for a different approach; mass media coverage are telling us how successful each approach was/is.Before travelling anywhere, a traveller must inform herself/himself about actual situation and actual procedures in both the visiting country, and the home country. One more piece of information that we need mass media (internet) for."
"I may not have made myself clear enough, here in the UK travel insurance automatically includes medical insurance. I am not aware that I can buy anywhere travel insurance which excludes medical insurance.They are both the same thing, so apologies for any confusion.So again if Ive read the conditions of travel to Sri Lanka correctly I need to have something ( medical/travel ) insurance that I cannot at the moment currently purchase.. Thats assuming the insurance specifically has to have cover for Corona virusAnd again to Eric as far as I am aware , if I read your post correctly #153 the NHS will absolutely not provide me with any help whilst outside of the UK."
"Okay sorry I don't know the exact NHS policies. For other European countries, at least NL-BE-Germany, the local medical insurance generally applies worldlwide. (Extra insurance is solely needed for countries where medical stuff costs more than at home, e.g. USA). Hence for these citizens medical insurance for Lanka is simply there; insurance companies cannot exclude Covid risks for this (only for other things like theft and cancellations, see above).If UK companies can exclude that coverage now - well a matter for UK Consumer Advocacies then. I don't think this specific Lankan rule is unreasonable at all, expect it to come for many other now slowly opening up countries. Up to the Brits to find a solution for their specific market, if your description is right it sounds a lot like the pre-Obamacare 'pre-existing conditions' in US health insurances of which every other Western country thinks these are totally unacceptable...< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"#158: Same in Canada. Our health insurance, which is very comprehensive inside Canada, does not cover travel outside the country. At the moment, as far as I know, no Canadian travel insurance provides coverage out of the country for COVID19.Edited: 12:47 pm, June 07, 2020 "
"Okay then interesting complications for all foreign travel out of Canada then. And again, as all non-UK European countries I've checked do this better, reason for some consumer action...< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"I have duel citizenship of UK and Canada and have lived and travelled from both countries.Both countries require additional medical travel insurance for travelling out of country. Most medical travel insurance (and cancellation insurance) is invalid once a level 3 or 4 travel advisory is posted.I am now resident in Canada and travel on group insurance. I was due to travel to Sri Lanka mid March, right at the time the advisories were issued. At that time most medical travel insurance ceased to include COVID-19, my group company declared at that time also that they would not cover COVID-19 medical expenses.I noted just yesterday that once again my insurance does include COVID-19 coverage. Other insurance companies I am sure will follow suit but I expect insurance rates will increase.Edited: 1:26 pm, June 07, 2020 "
"Okay great to hear. Any idea whether same company would also cover cancellations due to Covid again (e.g. if you test positive in the 72-hour-before-travel test)? The European situations I mentioned do for now exclude that, meaning new planned travellers to Lanka might want to book an expensive changeable ticket...< Erik>"
The group policy I have does now cover me if I get sick with COVID-19 and am unable to travel.
"Okay, an interesting difference caused by the different insurance models. For Lanka as mentioned above* All medical insurances for us would cover * Cancellation insurance for new trips, no matter what government travel advice exists, would exclude Covid* And normal coverage of travel insurance is void if the travel advice is negative. Which for Lanka this summer from the EU remains so, hence e.g. thefts or accidents are not covered...< Erik>"
"caw2014: It is good to know that at least some Canadian providers of travel insurance are again covering covid19 related sickness. The travel insurance that I get from my CC does not - or at least in March, they did not cover pandemics. I wonder what will happen to the snowbirds that travel down to Southern US every winter. I would imagine that their premiums will go up a lot if they want COVID coverage."
"From EU/Slovenian perspective (and I believe that all similar insurances within EU are having the same clause), any medical assistance related to COVID-19 (as of today, but in general, any illness that is result of an epidemy or pandemic) is not covered by such medical (or travel&medical) insurance.Technically I can buy a medical insurance to travel outside of Europe but it is not covering me costs related to COVID-19. Question is, will Sri Lanka require a specific medical insurance that covers also for COVID-19 or it will be OK with a general medical insurance that is not covering COVID-19.Just too many question marks for an average tourist to start planning its visit to Sri Lanka (or other country with similar immigration requirements) as of now. It will took some time for the authorities to adapt their requirements to what is feasible, and obtainable by tourists, if they will really want to restart the travel industry in each country."
"This out now with much more detailed information:https:/…No public transport allowed, including no tuk tuks.If you test positive for COVID-19 during any of the tests then its into 14 day quarentine at US $100/night.Discussion elsewhere on this confirmed that the list of approved hotels is expected to include homestays to 5* hotels but no provision for those of us that stay with family/friends/own properties. As yet I do not think this list is published. It is also expected that this will be revised as the situation allows. I personally cannot see this attracting many tourists, but it is just a start. I expect at some point it will become clear that other places are not proposing as many restrictions and Sri Lanka will need to be more competitive if they want people to come. But there is always going to be a trade off between boosting the tourist economy and public health...Edited: 9:20 am, June 08, 2020 "
This reminds me of the old sign in shops . . .'credit will only be given to persons over the age of 65 who are accompanied by both parents' . . .
"JohnandKathyP, Spot on!! Couldn't have worded it better! :-)"
Any idea when the government will confirm the date of August 1th? Some hotels we booked in the second half of July cancel our booking by theirself. Others say the date of August 1th isn't official yet.
"As far as I know, August 01 is official. They have published a detailed instructions of 78 pages. Link below:https:/…"
"Phew! Very detailed. Not much is left to the tourist's own will. If anything, it is a very good manual for eventual second wave, or future outbreak."
But a date doesn't seem to be mentioned.
Let's assume Aug-1. But only when that materialises per July 1st on ETA.gov.lk site you are certain.E+S
At least that date is now confirmed by some authorities to the airlines...dailynews.lk/2020/06/10/finance/220365/jetst…< Erik> & [Sandya]
"I don't think anyone can ever be 'certain' of the August 1 date. If we have learnt anything this year is that everything is subject to change and that a flexible ticket is a worthwhile investment! I know Qatar Airlines are offering a lot of flexibility for tickets purchased for travel up to the end of this year...I have been following the discussion on the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority Facebook page and hidden in the comments in a few places is comment from what apears to be an employee indicating they are considering dropping the requirement for the test 72 hours prior to departure, appreciating that will be a hard or impossible condition to meet for many. This would suggest that this is very much a fluid process that is under ongoing review. We should be encouraged by that.I think we need to appreciate that Sri Lanka has done better than most in containing the virus and they are not going to risk that. They need to stimulate the economy of course, but if opening up to tourists puts them back in the severe and extended lockdown they have been in that makes no sense. Again discussion on Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority suggest that hotels at the start will be 4 and 5 * only but this will be expanded over time. We need to be patient.I hope that where we might end up is that the first 14 days are in these approved hotels and with restrictions on public transport etc as that would represent a ""quarentine lite"", ie not full quarentine but tourists are in a controlled environment for the first two weeks until they can be issued a COVID free certificate just as returning Sri Lankans have been issued when they leave quarentine. This would then allow tourists to move as freely as locals as they are only as much risk as a local...But lets see..."
Schools are to be opened during the first week of July. Elections are to be held on the 5th of August. You'd find that most schedules and plans will be made around the election dates
"Sri Lanka is to open back for tourism from August 1st, 2020 after the lockdown. The country has announced that it will welcome holidaymakers from all countries from this date, however, they need to meet strict requirements and undergo testing for Covid-19 prior to entering the country.Edited: 11:04 am, June 11, 2020 "
"Now the plan seems to be again to have ETA @ USD35?colombopage.com/archive_20A/Jun13_1592025043…ft.lk/top-story/…26-701587< Erik> & [Sandya]Edited: 4:40 am, June 13, 2020 "
My feeling is that by the time August comes none of the strict regulations that were announced few days ago will be in force. My contacts in Colombo are telling me that all kinds of pressure are being brought on the government to further relax things by interested parties. Too much money at stake here.
"Hoping for that too. If other countries in the region, competing with Sri Lanka, implement less strict measures indeed it would be a loosing game for the island. (Added to the fact that most Europeans can holiday anywhere in Europe from July onwards without expensive and complex PCR tests.)Can't help concluding for now that comparing the numb er of infections and deaths of Lanka to most of Europe, the current plans are way too strict focusing on health numbers and ignoring the economic impact...< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"I don't know about from Europe, but airfares from North America for Travel in August to Sri Lanka are sky- high, the highest that I have seen ever since I came to Canada. No one from here is going to travel there at these fares that includes the ex-pats that go back every summer. The fares go down in September but that is the time schools start here so very few will travel then. If the govt wants North American tourists they need to find a way to lower the airfares."
"Was to to fly into CMB on the 15 th March , when a return ticket was around £500, depending on the day of week and the carrier.From the beginning of August the cheapest I can find using the ITA matrix is £811 with one of the gulf carriers. Sri Lankan I think are pushing their luck at a whopping £1600, good luck with that one fellas ( Ive stayed for a whole month at an all inclusive resort in Hikka for less than that, in August too"
"I just checked Google Flights for Toronto - Colombo - Toronto fares in August. The cheapest I see is over $1800 and that is a very inconvenient two-stop flight. The cheapest 1-stop flight is above $2600. Add the visa fees, PCR test fees, and other stuff, who would want to travel? The only time I paid that much was when I had to rush to Sri Lanka for a family emergency."
The local business also has mixed opinions about it ;-)https:/…< Erik> & [Sandya]
"did you read the updated requirements to enter sri lanka? besides the ""absurd"" that i pointed out earlier on post N'145, there is a new one: """"If any tourist is tested positive for COVID-19, he/she will be sent to a hospital or a quarantine hotel and will be charged at the rate of USD 100 per night.""LOLhas anyone found an insurance company that cover Pandemic quarantine costs??https:/…SL_Tourism_Operational_Guidelines.pdf"
"Well the insurance depends per country. For instance earlier in this thread we found that some Canadian policies again cover health insurance abroad even for Covid, and tiny Netherlands medical insurance is available worldwide if medical cost level does not exceed the European level.If you'd want TRAVEL insurance, e.g. this USD 1400 cost, insuring is probably a dream. But that for that situation you can cancel all your planned accommodation for 14 days, and of course no one books and no hotel should demand any nonrefundable/voucherable rate. And you would probably save more than USD 1400 due to that in the speciiic case that you test positively locally.So I don;t see this specific risk as blocking; some other risks (like that you travel without insurance for thefts and accidents if your own country still has a negative travel advice) and costs (the PCR test at home) could very well be blocking for most tourists.< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"I recently checked a few large Canadian Travel Insurance providers and they all exclude COVID-19 as a known event. It is only the specific group policy providers that insure various professional organizations that provide COVID coverage.This is from Manulife (one of the largest Canadain Providers):Update on March 5, 2020As of March 5, 2020 Manulife determined that COVID-19 is a known event and the applicable exclusion will be applied for new policies issued on or after this date."
i haven't been able to find any travel insurance companies in Italy that cover any costs related to Covid.
"Yes there are quite a few countries which have this issue for travel, In your case travel outside Europe, as inside Europe your Italian medical insurance can issue an EHIC card which allows access to all state health care throughout Europe (as long as cost level is not above Italian, generally not an issue for you). And the mutual EHIC schema cannot exclude any disease, until end 2020 this also applies e.g. to British people travelling through Europe.< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"Hey guys, regarding U.K travel insurance, Just Travel have confirmed that it will cover you against Covid, if you were to transmit it whilst on holidays, for future holidays booked only & as long as the FCO hasn't advised against travel of course. Staysure, Saga and Holidayextras are incuding Covid in their policies. Policy prices hasn't increased either.Here is the link;https://travelweekly.co.uk/articles/374814/j…Edited: 8:44 am, June 19, 2020 "
"Forgot to add, Postoffice are now covering Covid"

"Hari Raj,Note that most of your posts self promoting your company have been removed by Tripadvisor this morning so save your energy!"
"Okay several sources confirm that for now the list on SLTDAhttps://www.srilanka.travel/accommodation…is all allowed to be booked (through booking/expedia or through agents) for an ETA-approved stay. However your transport must be confirmed and also sent with the ETA application, hence an agent or a freelance driver putting the whole itin on paper is required.< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"Trailfinders have cancelled our holiday due to fly out on August 1st. Offering full refund. This was our second attempt to get to Sri Lanka, having had to cancel last year's trip due to FCO advice. Maybe it's not meant to be for us."
"Well strange of them, as exactly August 1st borders will open and the type of holiday that Trailfinders offers is allowed under the new visa rules?< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"Maybe because the UK is a mess these days (from the virus) and the company does not want to take unnecessary risks and complications if the touring party gets positive tested in Sri Lanka.I am really curious to see who will travel to SL in August.Edited: 11:57 pm, June 27, 2020 "
Sounds like August 15th will be the next hopeful datehttps:/…re-opening-airport-delayed-two-weeks

Might be opening on or after 15th of august 2020Hope you can check the Srilanka tourism page for more updates
"Well same paper story appeared about 1 week back, hence not much clarity. And also no clue why these silly rationale is given, batches of returning Lankans (which might continue for many months) going into quarantaine for 14 days and hence technically no danger to health have almost nothing to do with health risk from tourists (and the local travel industry screams to keep some of the jobs...)dailymirror.lk/article/…< Erik> & [Sandya]"
"I don't have a crystal ball, but I highly doubt that August 15 would be the date with the current situation. The opening date will most probably be delayed by a while."
"Starting tomorrow, Not even we citizens, are allowed to come back, so i don't think tourists will be allowed anytime before September.dailynews.lk/2020/…bia-re-opening-hold"
