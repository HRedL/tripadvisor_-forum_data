"Fab stuff Dianna, it's great to hear that the Reethi Turtle is about, tell hubby to keep a close eye on him for us! Rain??? are you sure?? LOL Enjoy your G&T and maybe you could test out the cocktail menu for me?"
An epidemic of lilos?? I wonder if it's spreading? I'll report from OBLU next week :-)Originally we would have been joining you at Reethi but the lure of a new island was too strong.
So jealous about the turtle! Where on the reef was that? We are currently sitting in the comedy karaoke with the words playing and no one singing! Otherwise loving every minute! Food outstanding staff are superb and we have seen so many amazing fish.... Cannot recommend enough!
"Seannaholland the turtle is normally see between the cut through at 160 and the water villas, I am sure that Dianna can confirm that. 3 more sleeps until we leave!!"
"The turtle was actually nearer 135 this time. No sign today, though. We did see a sleeping Nurse Shark about 6 ft. long. This morning Hubby shouted for me to come outside at about 8:30 am so I dashed out in my chemise to see a pod of Dolphins passing by - lovely.It's been a lovely day today but quite windy tonight. The afternoon sea gets quite choppy, too.Seems to be quite mature crowd here at the moment. That is age-wise and not necessarily mentality!Enjoyed a passion fruit Mojito at the sunset bat tonight.TTFN"
"hhmmmm passion fruit Mojito sounds good! I started getting ready for holiday last night by having half a dozen or so Singapore Slings :-/ ohh dear I need more practice, the hangover was not good this morning!!"
"Well done, Nik - very important you put in that pre-holiday training! :-)"
"I didn't feel so clever this morning when I got up Cakestin and still felt drunk!I think that I had better try again tonight, maybe with some woowoo's for comparison purposes, purely scientific of course!"
"Yes, perseverance is a very admirable quality! Go for it!!"
"Well Nikola, I won't be keeping up with you alcohol wise. We are fairly moderate drinkers. If I over-indulge it just makes me ill and my holiday is too precious.It's been another hot, sunny day but still choppy on the reception side of the island. We are currently sitting at Rasgefaanu Bar and it is blowing a hooley ( Geordie for very windy!). It's a warm wind of course.I forgot to mention that if you should hear someone wolf whistling it is not Bob the Builder or his Mates. It is one of two African Grey Parrots which are quite tame.I tried out the Coconut Spa today and had a free neck and shoulder massage followed by a baxk and leg massage. How such a dainty lady can have such power in her fingers, I don't know. I felt very relaxed afterwards,though."
HiLooking to visit this Island during the Easter hols and just found a decent deal but for B&B only. What would you budget per person per day for food/drink. Is it very expensive? Currently in the middle of a house move so having to watch the pennies!Thanks
"All of the menus for Reethi are available online on their website, so you could use those to estimate your costings. Remember to add the taxes! We spent a lot at Reethi because the food was gorgeous!"
"Sounds like you are having a lovely time Dianna, not long now until we join you :O) Hope to see you on Thursday!!"
"he he he maybe Froggy!!! We arrive Thursday lunchtime hopefully Dianna, Simon has it all planned, Reethi Grill for dinner then down to the WV bar for afters :O) so may see you there and we can hear all about your trip. Have a great time xxx"
Enjoyed your up dates Dianna - happy holidays Nikola not long now .Well jel
"We are now on Reethi, sitting in the Moodhu as hubby is 'starving'! I am gagging to get in the water but we are a pair of fins down as we're waiting for a bag to arrive, apparently in a hour. We will see!! The direct flight with BA would of been great if it hadn't been for the numerous babies taking it in turns screaming all night long, we didn't get much sleep. I think a few of the parents were more used to flying Easyjet to Benidorn that long haul which didn't help. Hey ho, we arrived in good time & jaded. It was the usual chaos at the sea plane check in but we were in the air within an hour & came straight here Reethi is just as beautiful as we remember & hopefully we will get a snorkel after hubbub lunch has gone down!"
i always wonder which resorts those screaming babies end up at. Im guessing high end.
"Four months today we'll be heading for the airport for our third visit to Reethi. Woo Hoo!!!Enjoying the blog ladies, do please keep it up :-)"
"I was just wondering if you had safely arrived! Quite jealous (although obviously I'm still not suffering from maldivitis!!) Would quite like to be looking forward to a dip in the sea right now! I had a complete blonde moment this morning and got to my first clients house only to open the boot of the car and realise I'd left my hairdressing box by the back door in the kitchen! Doh!!!! Have a fantastic time to all of you there, we will be dreaming of it!x"
"Glad you are here, somewhere Nikola. We met ROSCOEBA + MRS last night, fellow North Easterners. Will see them for a drink later.We went on the Coral Gardens teip today. It was quite choppy and actually too much for me so I had to come back to the boat early after about half an hour,s snorkel. We were disappointed with the coral, not much colour at all. Never mind but in view of that we have cancelled tomorrow's Turtle Faru trip.It s a lovely temperature this evening. Off for dinner at Moodhu. What could be better?!"
"If you get the chance, do the Kihadhoo/Kamadhoo trip on Saturday.Really interesting going to these two islands.John"
Weathers looking good on my App for next 5 days. Be interesting to see what the reality is
"We've just had a delicious dinner in Reethi Grill, need to walk it off but can't to reception to book for tomorrow night. We got the last table this wv I g, they were turning people away. I doubt the screaming babies ended up at high end resorts, they didn't look/act high end, all I care about is they are not here!!! Weather is lovely, water is choppy as Dianne says & got a bit cloudy this afternoon, it's blooming warm though which is fab. Dianne hope to see you in the Moodhu at breakfast? I've got pretty dehydrated so need to go & top up at the wv bar! Xxx"
"2016-Paul- here at Reethi Beach the weather is more as you would expect today; hot and with calmer seas and improved visibility. The humidity has dropped, too. This evening there is a pleasant, if hair-spoiling, breeze. Let's hope your weather app is right!I am getting along famously with my Tribord. Just goes to show we are all different. Enjoying the reef here and finding it quite comfortable to drift along with the current.That's 3 of us TA posters who can now identify each other!"
"Morning :o) The sea is a lot calmer this morning, hoping for a good snorkel, with cameras & better visibility today! We did use the tribord a again yesterday afternoon & mine wasn't tight enough the first time, it's fine now, no leaks & I like it. Simon didn't ditch his & tried again & it was better but he is going to use his mask today I think. I think it's going to be a scorcher today, the breeze has really dropped so lots of liquids require, non alcoholic for me of course! We ate in the Grill again last night, we had curry & it was flipping handsome, butter chicken & the pea, mushroom & cashew nut one, we will definitely have that again. Our walk home along the beach saw some bioilluminescent plankton speckles, we saw some the night before too. You have to look for them but they are there, so pretty, Also on Select you now get 2 free trips a week so we're going to see which ones to do & get booked on before the time vanishes & we can't do them. Ok breakfast time now, laters aligators! Xx"
As Nikola says it is a lot calmer now. Hubby saw a turtle this morning near Watervillas but reckons it was different one to the other day. We have seen rays most times we have snorkelled together with lots of fish soup. The bikini is feeling tighter with all the lovely food! Good job I wear a size bigger than I really am. We are well looked after by Babatosh & crew at Moodhu and Santosh at the Reethi Grill. Saying goodbye to Mr&MrsROSCOEBA today so we wish them a safe flight. It was nice to meet themEdited: 4 years ago 
"Looking at my living earth app ( which , yes I do every day) I don't think I've ever seen the Maldives so almost completely cloud free. It's almost like looking down on Dubai . It's gonna be a few scorching days methinks"
"We've only been here since Thursday & my clothes feel tighter already! We haven't seen the turtle again yet, the current was quite strong today & we got swept down a lot quicker than expected, also got distracted by swimming with a very beautiful shark for a while. It was a black tip & very curious for such a big one. There are several huge Titans around which make me nervous! Our plan for next snorkel is to go in at the high no water villa end & drift down, fingers crossed in the right direction :-)It was so hot last night, very humid & no breeze but that's back today thank goodness. I may of lot the plot a bit with 2 Asian looking tourists who were standing on the coral today :-( no fins & lifevests on. They reckon they didn't understand but I have found their room no so I'm going to tell reception who can translate for us. Ignorant so and so'sRight of to some more sunbathing, it's exhausting eating, drinking & snorkeling LOL"
"Only just spotted this blog. Full marks to Dianna for taking the initiative, and great support from nikola! How envious do I feel? And someone on Select as well? Did I ever mention how much that cost me for 2 weeks? :-) Enjoy, folks, and the more envious of us shall follow closely your progress!"
"Lynphd, you are now my heroin! I knew somebody would remember! Dianna - have a good time at the new Island. Some accolade to you that I don't think anyone except myself has previously started a Reethi blog, and the chances of me starting one this year relied totally upon Camelot, who are woefully inadequate at present! :-)"
"Thanks for sharing your experience from Reeth. I think it was a beautiful island as well. (I do also remember Bonters long blog, welcome back :)Hope you are running a blog from Kurumba as well Dianna!Edited: 4 years ago "
"Morning, it's another day in paradise here :-) Sunny, hot & having a fab time. Today is hubbys big birthday so we went out on jet skis to see the Dolphins, now it's not something I thought I would ever do but oh my goodness it was fab! They were great fun & we saw hundreds of dolphins, it one point which ever direction you looked in they were there! Bottle nose & spinners, we then snorkelled on the way back. No where near as many fish as here on reethi but pretty table top corals. Dinner tonight is in Saima Gardens & we are looking forward to that very much. Need to go & catch some more rays, adios for now! Xx"
"Dianna - I'm a bit disappointed in meself really! Only gambling and drugs? No mention of alcohol? And don't even start me on s*x an' Rock & Roll! The Who were and still are the best rock band of the 60's, trust me, I was there. AND it has been said that I am very good in bed - I think I am cos sometimes I stay there till noon! ;-)"
"Pmsl it's great to have you back Bonters!! It's another beautiful morning here in the Moodhu. Hubby had a little stylish dismount off the wet bike yesterday, literally getting off at the very end :-/ I jumped off waist deep, he tried to get off but the water got a little deeper than he thought, he somehow left a leg behind & has twisted his knee badly. Unfortunately I'm not the nurse type, no sympathy, just fill up on painkillers & crack on is my way of going, his hobble however was getting worse & worse so he went to see the dr last night. Came back with it strapped up, some strong painkillers & deep heat cream. No snorkelling for a couple of days & he's got to rest it, so I'm now going to snorkel solo, which may work in my favour as I know if he's not there the likelihood of me finding the turtle are hugely improved, Sod's law I think it is! We saw a rather large black tip shark off our deck this morning, he was playing with something but couldn't work out quite what it was. We also seem to have a Titan trigger that rather likes our steps as well so we have to have a scout around for him before entering! There seem to be quite a few huge Titans around at the moment, no problems so far but I do give them a very wide berth. Dinner last night was spectacular in Saima Gardens, I'm still full now, hubby on the other hand is under 'doctors orders' to have a good breakfast before taking his tablet!Today is going to be a day for working on my tan, finding the damn turtle & reading! Adios & catch up soon Xx"
hi diana. I with my wife are planning to go there next month. can u suggest me about dress code and safety? my wife want to spend time in beaches upto midnight. is it safe? if possible she want to go topless while sunbath. local people are friendly or we should be cautious..plz suggest
"Roni7664- I note from another post that you are only visiting for a couple of days. I hope you realise that the transfer to Reethi from Male will take up quite a bit of your time. However if you are still planning to go the answers to your questions are: dress code is casual but swimwear must be covered up in the restaurants. It is a "" no shoes"" Island meaning that the paths are sandy and if you wish you need not wear shoes during your stay. I prefer to wear flip flops. I am not sure why your wife would want to be on the beach until midnight. You ask if it is safe; I would say yes from a security point of view but the sun sets around 7:30 pm or so and it gets very dark so accidents could possibly happen on the beach late at night unless she is just going to sit on a chair or sunbed and look at the stars. Topless sunbathing is not only forbidden in the Maldives, it is illegal. In your short visit the people you will mostly meet will be the staff and other guests. The staff are brilliant but are not necessarily Maldivian. As with anywhere you go if you respect and interact with people they will usually reciprocate."
Nikola - sorry to hear about your Hubby's mishap. These men will go to any lengths for a bit of attention. Hope he gets better soon.If you see Babatosh at the Moodhu Bar please tell him we are missing him.Enjoy the rest of your holiday and good luck with the turtle search.
"Roni, From your earlier post and this one too, I'm a little confused as to what you are expecting from The Maldives. There are two types of holiday in The Maldives; firstly a stay on a ""Local"" or ""Inhabited"" island where Maldivian people live and work. Sharia Law applies on local islands, so there is a strict dress code which must be adhered to (particularly for women), and alcohol is prohibited. Such islands offer ""guest house"" accommodation but do not offer the picture postcard beaches and views you will see in travel brochures. Local islands are usually served by ferries which do not run all day everyday, so you would need to factor this into your stay.A stay on a Resort Island (such as Reethi Beach) is a totally different type of stay. Swimwear may be worn, though topless bathing/sunbathing or nudity is illegal throughout The Maldives, including at resort islands. Alcohol is also available. A resort island is one resort or hotel on an island. It's a bit like being in a bubble, but in the nicest way possible. The only thing on the island is the resort, it's staff (not necessarily Maldivian) and guests. You will dine at the resort restaurant/s and apart from perhaps a small souvenir shop there is no shopping to be done and no ""sightseeing"" apart from excursions offered by the resort. I too am confused at your wife wanting to be on a beach until midnight and asking about safety, which leads me to think that you are perhaps considering a local island stay and not a resort, but either way topless is a definite no-no which could have serious consequences. With respect I think a little more research on The Maldives as a holiday destination is required on your part; there's a wealth of information in the FAQs on the right hand side of this page. With such a short visit you need to factor in the cost and time of transfers, particularly to resort islands, which could eat into your money and time hugely."
"thanks for your reply. I have just decided to go Maldives on a short visit. knew almost nothing. I thought Maldives is a very small country, so distance from male would not be problem. as I have just 2 days and 2 nights, I don't want to waste time to go to a distant place.. can u suggest any resort island which is nearer to male and also with reasonable cost? I will pay how much it needs but I want enough value for money. I don't need shops, market, sight seeing tours. I just want to stay there 2days with complete peace n calm. I m not very good in english. don't know u understood my queries or not."
"Ron may I suggest you search on the forum for your answers. There are hundreds of questions just like yours & you will find lots of very helpful replies there. This is a reethi blog thread Not general questions :-) Thankfully hubby seems a lot better today, it's like a millpond out there so we are going to try snorkelling & see how he gets on. Think we will wait until a little later as the tide is really low this morning, strange because it was really high yesterday! We are Moodhu now but can't see Babatosh, will keep my eyes open for him though & pass on your message."
"Evening everyone, It's been a scorcher here today with very little wind, the breeze has got up now thankfully. We're just in the main bar replenishing liquids before dinner in the Grill! We had a rude awakening this morning by what I will call 'Pirates' :0( a large fishing boat appeared outside our WV at 7.30am literally at the drop off. They were shouting & several guys jumped in with a huge net & 'fished' I rang reception who were confused what was happening but the 'pirates' took a lot of fish with this huge net :0( several people where out on their decks & lots also rang reception. It was very distressing to see. They quickly did 3 huge nets of fish then got footed it off. Hubby got photos showing how close they were & the boat name/number/crew pics. We went down to reception & they are taking this illegal activity very seriously, we have given them our photos as have a few other guests. It was awful to see, I was really quite upsetting. It has been reported to the authorities. I went for a snorkel this morning & I know I'm imagining it but the fish all looked sad, except the Titans who looked even more ticked off than usual! I was bobbing along the drop off when I saw a large shoal of very pretty but fish (can't remember their names!) and in the middle was this blooming huge monstrosity of a fish. He was an ugly bugger with another fish (dead) hanging out of its mouth! I followed him for a while & he then settled by one of the cut through bouys to eat his brunch! I did get go pro footage & apparently it's a saddle back grouper but I'll check with the dive school tomorrow, he looked like jaba the hut he was that ugly & huge!! We went for another snorkel this afternoon & the fish seemed happier! We saw a moray & loads of unicorn fish, lots of little babies too. We are going to book a turtle trip tomorrow, I'm fed up with trying to find the ones here, I think they are camera shy, no camera & you see them, have a camera & no chance!! My tummy is somehow grumbling to remind me it must be at least 2 hours since it was last fed so we're off to dinner. Curry night tonight! Xxx"
It's been super hot here on OBLU today too. It seems to get hotter every day! That's terrible about the fishing boat. There's a lot of big Titans here too. I give them a very wide berth. Tomorrow is out last full day :-(
"Wow cakes tin your trip has gone quickly :0( but I'm not to feel too sorry for you as you have another one later in the year! We have a lovely breeze this morning which is very welcomed , our trip seems to be rapidly disappearing too so lots of sunbathing & snorkelling needed every day. The turtle is still safe & sound but seems to of moved down the reef so we are going looking for him again this afternoon at high tide. We saw some cracking pics of him taken yesterday so he is around!"
The time flies doesn't it. We went out super early this morning again but not so busy today - two turtles and a black tip but no eagle ray. A lazy day of pool wallowing for us now! Good luck with getting some good turtle pictures :-)
"It was really choppy today with a strong breeze but decided to give snorkelling a go anyway. Visibility was poor & we were being bobbed up & down like nobody's business. We didn't see much at first but then I think our eyes adjusted to the murk! We went past the cut through at 160 as the turtle has been seen that end..... And we found him!! The visibility cleared & we spent about 20 mins with him. It was hard to keep a good distance but he wasn't worried & came up for air several times. We have some great pics & my GoPro has some fab footage. I'm owner the moon & we swam straight at me at one point to get some air. I'm chuffed to bits & it has made our holiday :0) The ugly big bugger I saw yesterday was a Giant Grouper, confirmed by the water sports guys. Shame I can't post pics on here but we will get some sorted when we get home. Caitlin your trip sounds great, lots of variety of fish too by the sounds of it. I had a chat to one of the managers (not Peter) about Reethi moving & he said its here for another 5 years. Not what I've heard on the island but we are going to hopefully see Peter before we go & get it from the horses mouth so to speak. Right Reethi Grill is calling my name so I'm off, laters everyone xxx"
Good work you folk. Be assured that the less fortunate are sat at home following your every word! :-)
"Wowsers it's been so hot today, if I'm honest almost unbearably hot! There has been no breeze at all, the sea a mill pond & the sun scorching. Today for the first time we have shut our WV doors & put the ac on, the breeze is supposed to pick up tomorrow, hopefully. We are sitting in the main bar having a drink before dinner... Why are you banging nails in the posts I asked one of the staff... Hurricane he says! WHAT??? hurricane lamps he then says LOL Phew, thank goodness for that. It's been a very chilled day, way too exhausting to do much, the heat has been energy sapping. An early night is needed tonight, we had a very late night last night, we kept poor Janaka at the bar til gone 12.30am, we just didn't realise the time. Off to dinner now so signing off for today xx"
"Lucky you - still in paradise. Arrived home at about 10:30 this morning. It's cold, grey and rainy. Know what you mean about the heat, though. We usually visit in July and it seemed so much hotter and often stiller. And not one little drop of rain. Make the most of the sun while you've got it!! ;-)"
"Oh we certainly are making the most of it, we have freezing temperatures & snow at home apparently :-/ lapping up ever bit of sunshine we can! Last night continued to be very still, fab for spotting dolphins rough as the mill pond sea made them very easy to see. A strange mist also descended last night over the sea, never seen it before, it was quite eerie! Today normal service has resumed, the sun is shining & there is a lovely breeze. We're just having a quick brekkie then getting out in the sun to soak up every ray. Looking forward to catching up about your trip Cakestin when we get back xx"
"Enjoying your up dates, its so cold here this am - very envious ."
"Thank you Buzze :-) We had a fab snorkel this afternoon, there was a strong current but we got to the drop off eventually!! We say a ray this afternoon, a lovely black tip shark, starry rabbit fish, oculus & a very cheeky unicorn fish who took a liking to my GoPro & gave it a head butt!! No sign of the Giant Grouper or the turtle but lots & lots of fish. I saw another fish I've not seen hefore & can't find him in our book so I'll ask the dive school if they know what it was. Off to the Grill for dinner now, reckon I'm going to need to pay excess baggage on me on the way home!!"
Edit: wrong window..Edited: 4 years ago 
"Well we are most definitely missing Reethi!! We had the most amazing time. It is taking quite some time to go through the GoPro footage and I have only managed to do days 1-4 so far, I have tried to keep it as short as possible but I wasn't very successful!! Incase anyone wants a nose the link is here. I will be doing the rest as soon as possible but will be more selective!! https://youtu.be/AoNaTp1M8go"
"We must be thinking of Reethi at the same time, Nikola! I have just done my review and have been pining for the lazy days at the Sunset Bar etc. Going to check your link now."
"We set off on Wednesday!I'll endeavour to keep the thread going I've enjoyed reading the updates so much, especially since we thought for a while that would need to cancel this trip...I'm off to read Dianna's review and have a watch of your video Nikola :) hopefully it will help prepare me for turtle spotting!!Packing underway..."
"We will be there next Tuesday, all equipped with new triboards! will attempt to keep the thread going."
"Great review Dianna!Nikola, keep those videos coming :)I've seen the beds mentioned a few times at Reethi, a few folks comment that they're hard and occasionally I see 'mattress toppers' mentioned too.Hubby's back has been complaining a tiny bit lately, so if we find that the bed is a problem, is there something we can ask for? what is this magic mattress topper? and does it make the bed softer and/or more comfy?ta! (one more sleep)"
"I can't comment,as,I didn't know anything about any mattress toppers until we got home after this latest visit!"
"Hi ppply! We were at Reethi the same time as Nikola; her videos are great!The mattress toppers are really just padded mattress protectors that hook over the corners. I think if you are in the WV the mattress is a Tempur type so not a problem, but ours in 123 was a bit too firm, hence my asking for the toppers.Already planning our return for next year...just waiting for Emirates."
"Hi SunFreak!! Our bed in the WV was uber comfy! I slept like a baby every night :) Here is another video, shorter this time!!https://www.youtube.com/watch…more to come though, I've not got round to the turtles yet!"
"What a great day you had! Rob says he quite fancies that trip.He took an amazing video of your 'yellow banana' fish, a golden puffer apparently. I shall have to get that uploaded.I remember you saying about the WV beds being really comfy; we'll just make sure they put a couple of toppers on our rather firm bed!!"
"It was a fab trip, not blooming cheap though, but worth it :) I look forward to seeing Rob's videos, I think I've got some turtle footage, not as good as yours though but i'm hoping for a couple of good stills off it :O) xxx"
"Hi all - I've been having far too good a time to pop into the forum so apologies for that, but now live at Reethi having breakfast in the Moodhu on the most perfect day!Blue skies wall to wall a gentle breeze off the ocean and I've just been handed a glass of Prosecco to enjoy - heaven!Have been enjoying a really peaceful time here lots of doing nothing and lots of snorkelling and eating. Managed to burn my bottom on snorkel one despite being (I thought) careful!So far we've seen tons of fish soup, sharks and eagle rays and yesterday afternoon we found the Reethi turtle- I feel like I've peaked early!!We're in a deluxe villa between the water sports centre and the sunset bar which is a lovely setting but a bit noisy with the dhonis and the sea plane activities from around sunset. Luckily I have my earplugs!Right food has arrived so I'm off will update again soon...Bye from paradise!"
"Oops! That should read sunrise not sunset - too eager to get to my brekky ;)Forgot to mention that the bed is quite hard, my back is aching I little. But 3 more sleeps and we move to a water villa with Nikola's promised über comfy bed"
"ppply - totally jealous now. If you're having Prosecco with breakfast, you beat us hands down! Enjoy :-)"
"Dear allFirstly a massive thanks for the blog... Clearly a lot of ""Reethi-lovers"" out there...Which is great news, as 4 weeks today I'll have the soft white sand between my toes... And I cannot wait!For those that have been (or are currently there)... What are the ""must dos"" at Reethi?!?!Thanks in advance!!"
"ColsaHam - I think the chief 'must do' is absolutely nothing at all. And I'm not being entirely flippant there! But snorkelling is pretty much a necessity. The rest depends a bit on your appetite and alcohol intake, not forgetting your board basis. And............................RELAX. :-)"
"Must do at Reethi? As Bonters says - nothing! but "" a nothing which includes: snorkelling the house reef in the search for the elusive turtle, cocktails ( or whatever your tipple) at the Sunset Bar to watch the sun go down. Interacting with the lovely staff ( some great senses of humour amongst them), meals at Moodhu Bar and Reethi Grill ( if the meal plan or finances permit), counting the stars at night and the different shades of blue during the day, sparing the odd thought for those of us who are not there! Have a splendid time."
"Glad to hear you are all having a wonderful holiday and the weather is really good which has pleased my wife. We arrive on Reethi Saturday morning, flight lands at 0755 at Male so hopefully will be on the island enjoying our first drink at the Sunset bar by 12 noon. Last hour at work now looking forward to flying out Friday afternoon for two weeks in the sun, please come and say Hi,, we will be the very white couple at the bar drinking Moscow Mules. Peter and Sonia."
"ppply - myself and Mrs Bonters have long since been acknowledged as the best drinkers on Reethi by far but you have purloined our mantle for sure! Prosecco for breakfast requires REAL class, and you have that in abundance, well done! :-)"
Whilst on honeymoon in Italy last year I discovered the joy of Prosecco with fresh pear juice at breakfast. A classier version of a Bellini in my opinion :-) I'm a lightweight when it comes to alcohol but am pleased to report that there were no ill effects.... with the exception of walking straight into a lemon tree on the way back to our room and trying not to cry as I really hurt my arm! Not sure I'd be fit for much at Reethi after bubbly at breakfast so haven't indulged there yet but there's always an opportunity to try something new... did I mention that we'll be back there in 14 weeks???
"Yesterday we moved to our WV and I can confirm that the bed is much softer and very much more comfy - slept like the proverbial log! Although to be fair we'd drunk enough to down an elephant last night, that little bar at the end of the WV walkways is lethal Snorkelled from a different spot yesterday following our move and the current is much stronger at this end of the island. We were rewarded though by a massive sting ray, several stomach turning huge Titans as well as a fairly big shark - about 4 foot I'd say. Later in the afternoon I spied two eagle rays swimming by our deckWeather is still hot hot hot, we had a little cloud yesterday which was actually quite welcome and today we have puffy little white clouds and a lovely breeze, just perfectSkipping the Prosecco this morning Bonters - oh my head!"
Loving your updates
"I'm loving your updates too :O) please that you are sleeping well in your water villa.Santosh is fab isn't he, he looked after us in the grill last month. We also drank in the WV bar every night, it's beautiful there. Have you walked along the beach and night and seen any bioluminescent plankon?"
"Back at the Moodhu for breakfast with Santhosh :)Yesterday the sun was fierce, I think officially the temperature was 32 but it felt much higher than that! We filled the day with the usual doing nothing with a bit of reading, some fine food and lots of snorkelling. Yesterday's ocean dip brought us all the usual suspects and along the drop off, about mid way between the sunset bar and the WVs, the fish soup was just spectacular. At one point I turned my head to check where Mr Ppply was and all I could see were two fins, the rest of him was hidden behind a wall of those little black fish (are they bat fish?). My Titan fish friends are worrying me slightly less now, having researched them a little over lunch yesterday, I now know that usually they only attack if they have a nest - for your info folks, they make their nests in sandy patches, so usually safe over the reef provided there's a healthy respect for them!We also spied a huge moray eel yesterday. They look so feisty with their dagger like teeth, so graceful though.I've decided that I'm not a massive fan of the WV. The bed is really comfy and its magical to be able to wake up in the morning to the most amazing view across the lagoon to a teeny deserted island. But I miss the feeling of being connected to the island and all its happenings. We don't hear the birds whooping, or the fruit bats bickering and definitely not geckos chirping. Also, and this is purely our room orientation, we miss that last hour or so on the beach when other people start to wander off and the sun loses its strength a bit, turns golden and the baby sharks come out to hunt. That said though, I'm glad we tried it and we'll make the most of our remaining time here.No sea of stars yet Nikola, but we'll keep searching!"
Small update...We've just been treated to a pod of dolphins jumping whilst we ate brekky - just magical:)(Although moments later the peace was disturbed by a drone! Grrrrrr)
"I am reliving Reethi with you. Breakfasts in Moodhu are so peaceful and all the staff are lovely. I can't say I prefer a beach villa because I have never tried a water villa but they just don't appeal to me. I like to be connected to the island as you say. Ah Reethi I miss you!The island had just received their own drone when we were there, the same time as Nikola. The operator was learning to use it whilst we were relaxing and it came very close, grrrrrr! He wasn't very competent yet. So annoying when they fly over your head. I understand why the resort wants one to film ads but I hate them."
"I'm reliving it with you too!! We saw dolphins from the Moodhu at breakfast one morning, it's always worth keeping an eye out at sea, just in case :O) We havn't stayed in a beach villa so can not compare but we loved the WV, the feeling of seclusion and the amazing views when you open your eyes. I don't like the drones either but I have to confess I've watched a couple of Reethi YouTube vids that have used a drone and they are fab for giving a perspective of the island, they do 'drone' though and the noise is quite irritating. I hope you're keeping Santosh busy in that bar. Simon's favourite afternoon tipple was a chocolate milkshake with a double shot of Kahlua in it!! Enjoy every minute, it goes way too quickly xxx"
"Last night we had dinner in the Saima Garden, our second time. First time we chose the fish menu and last night we had the Maldivian one. OMG it was huge! Service from the guys in there is fantastic, as are all the staff here. A couple arrived shortly behind us to find their reservation request had somehow been lost between reception to the restaurant and were a little unhappy about it. Fortunately there was a vacant table albeit not made up. The guys scurried around almost silently and within a few minutes there was a set table, a much happier couple and a very apologetic manager doing his very best. Well done guys!The island guys have also been hard at work trying to protect what remains of the little beach opposite the WVs. All day yesterday they were pumping sand into another large bag and I think they'll be at it for another few days yet - they work so hard and it's so hot.Yesterday afternoon the lagoon out from the WVs was like a mill pond, everything was so still and quiet. At one point late in the day I thought we might get a bit of rain and I was actually genuinely pleased at the thought of being able to watch it roll in across the sea - alas it blew the other way though and our bit of paradise remains as SCORCHIO as ever, hard life!Nadir at the little beach bar is looking after us so very well, he already knows what we like and almost has a drink in our hand before our bums have hit the bar stool - heaven forbid your glass ever reaches empty.So now currently at the Moodhu enjoying yet another perfect breakfast setting. Just for a change we sat on the other side of the restaurant- my life is full of really hard decisions... What to eat, what to drink, swim or... Oh dear, at least my Kindle has things in order and just presents the correct reading material ;)Ttfn folks, sun to soak up & fishes to watch"
"Loving your updates ppply, enjoy every minute as all too soon it will be over. The staff are awesome & go so out of their way to do anything they can. Enjoy! Xx"
"Service as usual here in paradise folks. You'll be pleased to hear the the sky is blue, a few little fluffy white clouds, the breeze is gentle and warm, and that the sea is still the most amazing array of blues and turquoise imaginable The sand bagging continues in earnest, yesterday they reclaimed a good section of beach to the right of the WV jetted (as you look from the WVs) although the folks who had been using the sun beds there were absent, and along the beach a little towards the water sports area it looks as though some great sea creature has taken a huge bite out of the beach. I confess if that were my alloyed beach area is not be too impressed. Whilst the island will no doubt regain its natural beauty in a few days, maybe a week or two, if all this happens under your nose in your precious two weeks then ...hmmm, it is however necessary I do get that. The Tellytubbie contingent is in fine force here at the moment lots of tribord masks to be seen, having had a little trouble with my own mask yesterday I can understand the appeal of a simple solution, although I have a lot (and I mean A LOT) of hair so I've trouble enough with one simple head strap, heaven knows the mess is be in with a head harness!!No more sight of the dreaded drone thankfully, fingers crossed that remains the same. I too confess to watching the videos on line and longing to be 'there', they do give a good feel for an island. I guess that makes me a nimby!Breakfast today in our usual over the water Moodhu was accompanied by a blue Prosecco, Santhosh is really looking after us. Last night he was our waiter at the Grill too and I hold him fully responsible for my alcohol intake (good job well done !!)Time of writing is about 13:00 Reethi time so lunchtime soon and back the the Moodhu and again to the Grill this evening. I'm very much enjoying the Reethi Select and the freedom you have. Others have Alison commented on the excellent wine list and I'd whole heartedly agree, we've had some excellent tipples, some we'd not usually try at home, I fear there are now even more wines on the Ppply household approved list - oh dear...Signing off for now folks, just a few more updates to come from me, Wednesday is our last full day as we head home on Thursday morning bright and early. I'm trying not to think too far ahead especially as for us th Maldives is a once ever 2 or 3 year trip with often nothing else in between. I'd much rather have a really nice holiday less frequently than just make do every year for the sake of going on a plane somewhere Ttfn - back soon!"
"I remember thinking that something would no doubt have to be done about the beach near the WVs when we did our regular circumnavigation of the island. I never saw any more than two couples there in our 10 day stay. Like you, ppply, I wasn't too impressed by their beach area but I suppose most WV dwellers are on their decks.Santosh is a lovely man; such a gentleman and so considerate. We love Babatosh, too. Is he still there or did he go on his trip home?Re the Tribord and hair problems: one of my frustrations with my normal mask was that my hair was always getting tangled in the strap and it was a painful fight putting it on and off. I have between chin and shoulder bob and it was on Spammie's advice I believe, I bought a mask strap cover. I only tried it at home and it made a great difference but then bought my Tribord. Honestly the Tribord is so much easier to put on and as long as your hair is pushed off your forehead it is a doddle to put on. The straps are thick bands of elastic rather than rubbery. Keep on enjoying the rest of your holiday. Tough order. - not!"
"Great updates ppply. I shall forever have a vision of someone who actually drinks more frequently than Mrs Bonters! Even she'd struggle at breakfast, though thinking about it, we have had the odd glass of bubbly at some of the buffet breakfasts, most notably Vegas. Enjoy the remainder of your stay, it all goes way too fast. ;-)"
"Babatosh is still here, equally lovely, it's just that we've seen more of Santhosh :)Today started a little cloudy which to be honest was welcome - look at the Brit who pays tons of money to go 607km from the equator and is then pleased to see clouds!However after the lazy breakfast in Moodhu the clouds were already clearing and the sun poking it's head through. I'm writing this from my shady lounger on the WV sun deck having feasted on fresh fruits and pastries; Mr Ppply prefers a full English with a beef sausage. We're such creatures of habit that Santhosh is already waiting with our drinks whenever we arrive for breakfast or at the Grill for dinner - makes you feel so special. It's a little touch that more hotels should encourage. The morning has been spent lazing in the shade, my nose in a kindle, Mr Ppply's nose in his iPad book, whilst keeping an eye on the little boat 'parked' across the lagoon on what we've named 'dead tree island'. It's a small island with an even smaller connected island and a dead tree between the two. Very Robinson Crusoe. I wish TA would allow you to insert photos into the forum threads...Yesterday's snorkelling foray took us out along the reef heading towards the water sports centre as usual. Although we walked along the beach a little way and went in through the first channel as the current here has been very strong. We pottered around for a bit drifting this way and that, enjoying all the colourful critters. Mr Ppply has been on a mission to show me cuttlefish as I've not yet managed to spy them. Yesterday we we found them and bobbed along for a short while alongside, although they're tricky to spot and when they decide they're off my goodness they scoot fast! Great eyes :)A short while after that I spied the turtle just a little way off and as I manoeuvred myself to drift quietly by he decided to change direction and headed straight for me. I was a bit concerned that I was in his way but he wasn't phased at all and swan straight underneath my tummy! So glad I'd taken the GoPro with me, I'm not the best camerawoman by a long shot but what a memory!! It's my first time filming with the GoPro so it's all new to me but once we're home I'll endeavour to post up a link to the best bits - have to work out how to edit first though... Thus far our fishy finds have included a huge Stingray, a little group of three Eaglerays, a couple of encounters with Mr Turtle, the cuttlefish of course as well as the huge groups of multiple fish at the drop off, several sharks of various sizes, several huge Titan Triggerfish (one swimming around with a clam in his mouth like a happy Labrador) and quite few swim-bys from the inquisitive Trevally fish. Last night at Nasir's bar we got talking to a newly arrived couple on their honeymoon, their first time in the Maldives, although experienced divers. I found myself feeling a little envious of their 'Maldive-virgin' status; it's such a magical experience coming here for the first time and one that lives with you always. Bonters, today we abstained from breakfast Prosecco, but we're continuing to plough our way through the fab wine list - there's a NZ Sauvignon Blanc from Malborough that I'm particularly keen on :) I fear Mrs Bonters mantel is safe, I'm a bit of a lightweight, but my technique and stamina has definitely improved over the last week and a half. My liver though is looking forward to returning to a normal routine which is mostly tea based..."
"Bah, humbug, I got it now! ppply is just someone sat at home trying to make us all believe there really IS a Reethi turtle and make us all jealous. Probably that scouse Ian bloke winding me up? Prosecco for breakfast, Reethi turtle, blah blah. Your cover's blown buddy! (JOKE) :-)"
"Lovely update! Well jel!We-who-have-seen-and-swum-with know the Reethi Turtle is no myth!!! And fizz for breakfast can be lethal! it's that Nina Franco in the Moodhu. It appears you have discovered the Spy Valley Marlborough too! If I can get the quality up I shall post a few videos...including Nikola's Yellow Banana.And....*jumps up and down*...we have just booked for next year!!!! The prices are quite a bit higher, but the flights are at their cheapest. I will have to get my countdown clock going.Have a safe flight home tomorrow ppply."
"The Wishbone Sav Blanc is one of hubbys favourites, he says the Pinot Noir is good too. Our local Asda sells it so you will able to get it when you get home.... And a lot cheaper too! I am so jealous that you're out there, I've still got lots of go pro footage to go through & youve spurred me on to get on with it. We too won't be able to return for 2 years so I love reading the blogs & transporting myself back there. Please say hi to Santosh from Nikola & Simon who where in 206!"
Another thumbs up for the Wishbone Sauvignon Blanc. Delicious when properly chilled by Babatosh and Santosh!
"So today is our last full day, and I'm feeling reflective as well as both happy and sad. I never feel entirely ready to go home but I am starting to miss my own home, my bed and soppy me, my oh-so-fat ginger cat! I will have a proper think before I review Reethi but we've definitely had an amazing holiday with some memorable food and snorkelling (and yes Bonters, that includes the turtle, twice). I will post a link for proof ;) just as soon as this middle aged techno-phob works out how to edit (would you believe I work in telly land!?).Yesterday was a quiet one for us lots of reading and a little bobbing about in the lagoon behind our WV with dinner again in the Saima Garden. To be honest the sun got me a litter bit too much yesterday despite being under cover, it's just so fierce! So today will be a slow day with some snorkelling before lunch and no doubt again this afternoon. Then we will need to pack before our last supper at the Grill perhaps accompanied by the lovely NZ number ;) good to know we can get it at home Nikola!The guys are continuing with the beach building, I would think that within a week or two it will all be completed, so anyone arriving from April wouldn't really know what's been going on. Some folks here at the moment in WVs and those in the Beach Villas just along a bit, will have suffered a bit of disruption and I'm sure it would have annoyed me a little bit to have a beach muncher right opposite my sunbed. I guess though there's no easy time to do these things and they're getting it done fairly quickly.Nikola, Santhosh was at breakfast this morning so I sent him your best, he says hi in return :) actually we've been just a few doors up from where you were, we're in 210, so you'll know well the little island we've nicknamed 'dead-tree island' just across the lagoon.Sunfreak, you lucky devil! Have you stopped jumping yet? I did the same last September when we finally decided on Reethi. Our last visit to the Maldives was in April 2013 so it felt like ages. Until you land at Male and everything is oh so familiar; from the heat that hits you at the top of the plane steps to the moment the seaplane touches down in the middle of nowhere and a blue dhoni chugs up...This will no doubt be my last update here so the next lucky guest at Reethi will have to take up the baton - I'll look forward to catching up on all things Paradise from another's perspective. I enjoyed others' updates so much; the first I discovered was Bonters last year when he kept us amused with his snorkelling antics, Prosecco consumption and updates on his Select package - how much was that again..?Even before we'd booked it was great to feel connected with this special place through others experience 'live'.For a long while we thought we might need to cancel this trip, so when Dianna started this years thread it was bitter sweet for me, and I didn't really feel I could pipe in. By the time Nikola had finished her updates we knew we were coming. My updates have been a little thank you to those of you who contribute so much to this forum, Reethi and others, especially to the somewhat silent stalkers like me who pop on regularly for their maldivitis fix but often have little to say. I'd love to be more active but sadly my experience is fairly limited. I hope you've enjoyed sharing our little piece of paradise, thanks for the encouragement along the way, and I know there'll be lots more folk reading quietly in the background :)Will we be back to Reethi? I think so, but let's have at least six months of enticing research first, it will no doubt start on Monday lunchtime when I find myself back at my deskSigning out!Ppply xx"
"Thought I would post after reading pplys comments. We have overlapped with them and are actually next door but one in the WVs. My wife and I have been trying to guess who pply was but we think we have figured it out as we saw her pass the message to Santosh.Anyway, to echo their comments, we used trip advisor and the forum voraciously before choosing Reethi Beach (Bonters should get commission). Been here 10 days now and stayed in a beach villa and WV. Loved both and glad we did both. Also did Select All Inclusive and have really enjoyed the freedom and wine when dining.Saw the turtle today from our balcony so definitely exists! Did the dolphin safari yesterday on a speedboat, saw hundreds of dolphins so well worth it. We loved it.Currently in the main bar on our second bottle of Prosecco after a lovely meal at Reethi Grill. Best wedding anniversary yet even if I did forget to get a card. I did plan the holiday so I think all is forgiven.May post again or may not. Will continue reading though so I can relive the holiday when we are home. 4 more nights then back to UK, will make the most of them by doing nothing!"
There is still time. Hubby forgot to get a card for me and got one at reception at Reethi!
"ppply you have made me well up!!! Thank you so much for writing such fab posts, it has been a pleasure to read every one, just like SunFreaks :O) I absolutely love reading Reethi blogs, when you are waiting for your very first trip the excitement they create are fab, but when you are returning you can almost see/feel what the person is describing and you know exactly where it is. I know exactly what 'dead tree island' is! I spend many an hour with my binoculars checking out what was going on over there!! We made friends with the guys staying in 210 when we were there, they saw the turtle from their balcony too, I thought they were bs'ing me!! The Wishbone tastes just as great hear I am reliably informed. I don't shop at Asda but you can buy it online and get it delivered for free, which is what I do. I too started researching as soon as we got back for our next Maldives fix, hubby wants to go straight back to Reethi in 2 years, I feel the need to look at other places, just to check out the competition LOL #Have a safe flight back, hope you've got a jumper in the car, it's blooming cold here!"
I have finally gone through the GoPro footage I took of the turtle on Reethi and have edited it down to this...... https://youtu.be/tES44Hn2hBw Bonters this is real too!!
"Well done Nikola! I need to get onto mine now :)We arrived home an hour or three ago, long day and a bit of a delayed departure from Male but direct BA flight does mean home relatively quickly.I wanted to pop in again and say thanks so much for the kind words. I actually really enjoyed writing my posts and the replies were lovely to get. Note to self, don't be a silent stalker, chip in more ;)...and one last memory. On our last snorkel out yesterday afternoon (wow that's a long time ago!) not only did we see the turtle again - that's three sightings now - just as we came back to the beach a group of Eaglerays came right into the shallows inches from the sand, just fabulous to see......view of the island this morning from the seaplane was spectacular. Thank you Reethi for a magical holiday"
"Wow it sounds like the Reethi sealife saw you off in spectacular style!! I can not believe that we were still there this time last month, it has gone so quickly. I love this thread, it is so nice to hear other peoples experiences, we can not wait to start researching for our next trip, sadly not for a couple of years though :("
"My review is up guys if you fancy a read, there will be some photos to follow once they clear TA security.Px"
"I can't see your review, it says it is still pending?? Does remind me though that I need to get our one sorted out and posted xx"
"Oh I assumed as I could see it everyone could - it must take a while... I loaded a few photos too, some of the sand works as I'm sure folks would be interested..."
"I think it took about 24 hrs before mine was approved last year so it should be up tomorrow. Havent really enjoyed the last 2 most recent reviews about people staying in the WV who were complaining about not having enough space for their sunbeds allocated to them on the beach. They chose to stay in the WV s after all so whats the problem? Really enjoying the posts on here and bringing back wonderful memories of last year, so much so we're coming back to Reethi next April woop woop!Edited: 4 years ago "
"Hey ScottyI understand their frustrations especially as the sun beds were pretty crammed into a teeny bit of beach. But I agree, if you want the beach stay in a beach villa... Having now done both water and beach villa I don't think we'd be in a hurry to go WV again, but it was a nice experience. For me the biggest issue was lack of shade - I'm quite fair skinnedThe engineering guys were working hard to replace the beach and making good progress last week so I would think it'll all be completed quite soon. Actually I feel more sympathy to the guys in the beach villas where they were sucking the sand from, they had no real alternative. At least the WV guys had a peaceful & secluded deck."
Your review & photos are there now ppply.
Oooh! Thanks Lynphd :)
"Great review ppply, shame it was so brief haha!! Not sure if your remark about the standard villas is accurate though. The ones on the east side (sunrise) do have a path that separates them from the beach, but the ones on the west side follow the line of the DBVs and the path is on the island side. Well I hope so as thats what we've requested for next year lol"
Great review Ppply but yes Scotty you are correct - majority of the standard villas are also found on the west ( reef) side so have the same geography as the DBV . There are some standard villas on east side but very few - here is a link to a map below . Some of the villas on the west side down near the water sports centre have also been re - designated as standard www.reethibeach.com/about-us/interactive-map/
"I don't know re edit ... but have to say , I enjoyed your review much more than war and peace :) ... and I loved war and peaceEdited: 4 years ago "
Thanks buzze! I loved Reethi as you probably gathered. Just checked on the edit thing and I can't do it. The only option is to retract it and then re submit. Hopefully Reethi marketing will reply to my review and make the correction for me
"Could have been worse, like gone with the wind haha! But seriously, I love reading the long reviews, as long as they're fair and constructive. Cant stand it when people return from paradise and just say something like ' had a wonderful time etc'. Not really a review is it. If you do retract it ppply then copy it first so you can paste it and then edit it before you re post it. Wouldnt want to write that all again would you?"
"Great review ppply, you have inspired/reminded me to do ours.... mine has ended up like Gone with the Wind too!!! All submitted now :O)"
"We are returning in 2018 too ppply! It does sound a long way off but it'll come round soon enough I'm sure :-) I miss it too, miss everything about it, especially the sunshine!"
"Great review, Nikola. I was transported right back to Reethi. Whilst we have no current plans to return there (several other islands in the frame), it will always be a special place to us with the most wonderful staff. AND I saw the turtle, yay!!"
We need a 'like' button! Xxx
"Dianna, I think we stayed in 110 at Reethi in 2013. Not sure if the neighbours heard me talking to the resident Fred (gecko) :-)"
"Lovely to read your review Nikola, 11 weeks from now we'll be there. Third visit, Water Villa again and simply can't wait."
"Ah Beanerd, so it was you he was talking about!"
"Great review Nikola - looking forward to your up-dates Placitasgirl :) I will keep the blog going in August - woo hoo, - yep booked again ; I blame this blog ."
"Hi everyone, am new on this blog...but have been researching Reethi beach resort as hubby and me are planning a detour trip for 4 nights to Reethi from Singapore before coming back to UK. This blog has sealed the deal for me ,cant wait for mid June to arrive when i`m there.Can i just check I have the right info...its £450 for the two of us for domestic flight transfer and approx £500 for bed n breakfast. I did find the transfers pretty steep, but is that normal for Maldives? Its my first trip. Does that sound about right to all of you? Any websites all you seasoned maldives lovers would recommend?? Thanks in advance."
"Welcome to the forum alugirl. The domestic transfer price sounds about correct and that will be a domestic flight from Male to a small island and then a 20 minute speedboat trip to Reethi. Theres also the seaplane option which is more expensive but they only fly in daylight hours generally. The price for accomodation you have given seems to be the price for a deluxe beach villa going by Reethis own website rates, but a standard beach villa would actually be cheaper than that. We did DBV last year but have booked BV for next year as they are very similar apart from a few extras such as bath, a swing and a lounge area. Magic of Maldives, Simply Maldives, Purely Maldives are just some of the recommended agents which people on here use. Dont quote me on this but I think some agents insist on a minimum number of nights for UK customers but Im sure someone will correct me on this if Im wrong."
"Oh I so envy you alugirl!You will absolutely love Reethi, I can't really add much to what's already been said other than ENJOY and say hi to the turtle and the rays for me.Oh, and if you decide to go for a Reethi Villa and not a Deluxe Villa, ask for one on the sunset side as there are a few on the other side of the island that have a path between them and the beach.Definitely speak to the agents listed above you will almost certainly get the best deal that way, I would add Travelbag and Tropic Breeze - we booked through Tropic Breeze and they were brilliant.feel free to PM me if you've any questions I can help with, Dianna53, Nikola and I were all there earlier this year (albeit not together) so fresh in our minds still :) Px"
Definitely still fresh in our minds :) ask away and I look forward to reading more blogs!
"Apologies of my late reply. Thank you scotty202, Dianna53, ppply, and Nikola for your prompt tips, suggestions and advice. Have decided to go ahead with REETHI and am sooooo looking forward to it. As we are only there for 4nites decided to opt for the water villa for the view and the experience. I have managed to book the resort via Agoda for 4 nites as all of you were right, all the agents mentioned had a minimum 4 night policy for UK customers. Roll on June...REETHI here we come :-))))"
"Nearly time now ... getting very excited. Found out that I don't have to pay to have a kettle and tea facilities in the standard villa as they are now included . Anyone been recently - any other news ? Is the egg man back yet?I have treated myself to a new snorkel and mask - really pleased with it so comfortable , hoping its as good in the sea as it seems to be in the bath !!! Its a nice pretty pink too ☺Edited: 4 years ago "
"Have a fab time Buzze!I'm feeling very envious of you, no holiday countdown for us anytime soon <sigh>We were there in March this year, but I know others have been more recently. Can't comment on the Egg Man as we never ventured into the main restaurant, breakfasted in the Moodhu, They were tackling the beach movement when we were there, but no doubt that's finished now....I too am a 'pink snorkeller', I think the fish appreciate a well dressed observer :)"
"Oh Buzze, lucky you!!! We were at Reethi for our 3rd visit in June but it feels like forever ago.... So the bad news is that there has been no reprieve for the egg man :-( You can of course still order your eggs/omelettes at the table, but we found this very hit and miss to be honest. I think eggs are one of those things that everyone likes cooked in their own way and it's so hard to get right. It's also a bit of a nuisance waiting for your eggs before you go to get hot food from the buffet, or watching your hot food go cold whilst you wait for your eggs, but hey that really is a First World problem isn't it! The cooking station did have eggs benedict and eggs florentine on when we were there. I understand from Thomas the F&B manager that there are no plans to reinstate the egg man, so it is what it is.We loved Reethi just as much on this visit as previously. We were quite shocked to see the extent of the erosion of the beach at the Water Villa end of the island, but staff were doing what they could to minimise it's impact and of course the island is always changing due to the elements. One of the uninhabited islands off the Water Sports end of the island is now being converted to a resort (not the new Reethi resort though) but work is in the very early stages and apparently it isn't expected to open for about 4 years. Enjoy your countdown and have a wonderful trip. We will definitely return, probably before the new resort Reethi Faru opens. Look forward to your updates when you return."
"Hope you continue the blog... We've got 41 more days to wait until we go to Reethi, so would love to read about your holiday. Hope you have a great time!"
"Thank you all. I will certainly up date the blog from time to time but will likely post pictures on the Maldives FB page. Intersting about the new island Placitasgirl will have to look out for that . Shame about the egg man. :( I have not had breakfast at Moodhu so will maybe try it this year. Also I've never had the buffet in the evening so maybe that too. I really noticed the difference August last year in relation to sand shifting around as previously visited in the high season so it will be interesting to see if its the same this August. To all those not got anything booked - fingers crossed for you. To those that have may the time fly, and have a lovely time in Greece Scotty. I going to Embudhu first , my first two island hol so looking forward to seeing somewhere new and hopefully getting a coral fix if its not too bleached."
"SuperNana those 18 days will fly by!...you've just inspired me to go back and re-read the blog. Reading my posts from our visit in March brings it all back - how fantastic this island is, how you immediately feel relaxed and at home. The oh so soft sand, the great food and the amazing staff. In some ways it feels like a lifetime ago, in others I'm right back there as I read.I used to wonder what spell this island cast on its visitors, why did so many go back year after year..? on our flight there were another couple who had been every year for quite a few (I forget the exact amount, but I'm going with around 10!). Now I get it, we've been to other islands and enjoyed them, but Reethi does have a different feel. Its not the most polished, a bit chipped in places really, but that's all part of its charm; its like that favourite jumper you pop on when you cosy up on the sofa.Have a fantastic time Nana as a repeater you already know what a fantastic time you'll be having, enjoy every sunny moment, every fishy (and turtley) encounter, eat drink and make merry. You lucky, lucky devil !"
"Thank you ppplyWe first went in 2007 for my birthday, no need to say which one! We fell in love with the whole package. As you said, it's not the classiest, but I wouldn't swop it. We came home feeling totally refreshed, exactly as you should after a holiday. We found the staff were so pleasant and helpful, it almost made me feel guilty to ask for something, as they would rush off to do or get whatever it was. The pace of the island is the biggest bonus, everything is at our leisure, so relaxing it's an effort to roll off the sunbed to snorkel to get back on the sunbed!!We went again the following year and the intention had be to go every other year after that. However, in 2009 we had a family tragedy that stunned us to the core. We are getting life back on track and this is the Holiday to mark the changes in the future. We couldn't think of anywhere more delightful than going back to Reethi, just booking it made a difference. I know that may sound strange, but it is true. My first review of Reethi was titled Paradise Found, and that summed it up for me. The last time we left, I was struggling not to weep. I have never, ever, felt that way about a holiday destination before. I am not the ""cry like a baby at the drop of a hat type""!Hopefully, i will be able to add some pictures or a word or two to the blog or FB page.X"
"It's a struggle, but someone's got to do it."
We arrive on the 17th! I'm rather excited. It's our first time at Reethi. Hence really enjoying this blog! Will be watching for your posts SuperNana
"Very envious of you Buzze! Enjoy every moment.We found the best spot for Turtle spotting when we were there in March was over the slightly poor looking coral around midway from the water villas to the jetty (heading away from Moodhu), fairly regular spottings. The eagle rays too were often found around the same spot but at the drop off and a fair way down; they would come up to the shallows at the end of the day though just around sunset. One evening we spied them skimming the waters edge, two adults and a baby :)Fingers crossed the sun makes an appearance for you, but it sounds like you're having a fab time either way.Keep the updates coming, I love reading them!"
"Hey BuzzeLoved your post, my excitement level is nearly off the scale!, 13 days until we get there! Not that I'm counting or put an app on phone!We can't wait to snorkel the reef again. As for the lack of beach, as long as I can get a sunbead on there, I won't be complaining. Enjoy the rest of your time there hopefully you will take the rain home with you too lol"
"Thanks for the update Buzze, I love reading the forum member's blogs from the islands! Hope the weather improves. Keep having a great time!"
"Well I never did get to post again whilst there but thank you for the well wishes, yes the weather did improve but generally it was a mixed bag. I was not able to snorkel as much of the reef as usual as the wind was strong and the sea very rough on the west side . It was ok on the drop off but you had to brave the crashing waves to get there on quite a few days. Putting fins on in the water was quite a challenge :) Only occasionally was it calm enough to explore over the reef itself . The east side was always calm and I did find a reef drop off on that side which I had not seen before. Overall I had a fab holiday and would certainly return a fourth time ; however Reethi Faru may tempt me next time. Hope you had a good week Kelly and SuperNana ; you will love it.Edited: 4 years ago "
"Some photos here - I had a disaster with my underwater camera and could not use it at all on Reethi and for some reason I forgot to take my spare . Consequently there are not many underwater pics -those that are here including the manta pics were taken on cameras I hired from the dive school. The camera I used for the manta trip was the best they had- small Sony cybershot in housing ; the rest on the house reefs were taken on just a point and shoot , no zoom / flash or anything. In case anyone is wondering ( as I was) the fish with the grey/white stripe along the middle are ( with the sting rays) are Cobia. https://goo.gl/photos/f3C9jAUS3dkRFZMR9Edited: 4 years ago "
"Nice pics, buzze. Brings back happy memories."
"Thank you BuzzeThis time next week, we will be in the bar reminising on our first day back! I am going to be such a pain in the behind this week, everyone is fed up listening about it already, just imagine how annoying I will be with only days to go?We will have to look into the details of the new Island whilst we're there. Thanks again for your updats.P"
Yeh - 132 is closer to the sunset bar too ! Thanks for the update - so pleased for you that the weather is good and fingers crossed it remains so.
"We arrived on Saturday so thought I would add to the blog! Unfortunately we landed to rain and then a huge storm overnight, which was rather dramatic in the water villas!However since then the weather's been lovely. We're very impressed with the resort so far. Service, food, and the atmosphere have been amazing. Can only compare to mirihi and lily beach but so far everything has surpassed expectations. Really enjoying being on B&B - especially the food in reethi grill.Diving has been good too - we had over 30 mantas at one cleaning station! Will add more info later."
"Great news , keep on enjoying. :)"
"Glad you're enjoying Reethi!Make sure you try the massive grilled prawns in the Grill, they are to die for :)"
Two of my favourite islands blogging at the moment: Reethi Beach and Baros. Excellent!
Ooh! Have just booked Reethi for next March so very interested in this one.How is the erosion near the water villas?
"I don't think the erosion is bad, there are still sandbags but it looks better than the photos I saw on here. And we are staying in the water villas so do look at that area a lot. It also seems like they are doing a bit of renovation on the water villas - from room 222 onwards they are replacing a lot of wood, around the doorways and in the floor boards. It looks like all the others have been painted again too. I was suprised by this as I know it's not too long until the island moves. Good to see everything's being maintained!We've had some really fantastic snorkelling, even saw the reethi turtle (roughly outside room 160). I couldn't believe how long it stayed in the shallows, it was really fantastic. We've also been diving and snorkelling on the 'non-reef' east side - saw a group of four eagle rays diving (amazing!) and saw lots of sting rays both when we were snorkelling and diving. The fish feeding really does draw them in, never seen so many before.Thanks for the tip on the prawns! They're fab! Really enjoying the food here. And the iced tea and coffee - developed an iced tea addiction. This truely is a wonderful island. I was worried it wouldn't live up to expectations but it has far surpassed them. Already talking about coming next year.... Ooops!"
"Arrived late on Monday and I have to say it has been a long time since we were here last,2001 I think! I am a little disappointed as its not as good as I remember it. Food in main restaurant is very limited to what they used to have and staff nowhere near as friendly as other islands that we have been to. The Moodhu is still great though.Haven't done much snorkelling yet as water very choppy on the sunset side. Have tried my tribord mask which I quite like, hubby hates his and has lent it to a German guy who doesn't like normal snorkels plus he thinks that it makes you look like a tellytubby!"
Just having a mooch round the Blog again; lovely to hear so many positive things still being highlighted! Can hardly wait until Feb. I was just wondering if any more has been flagged about the proposed closure/move to the new island?
A couple of the forum regulars have visited the new resort and posted some updated info recently; Suffolk John and I think Paula from Magic of Maldives. If you check their posts you should find them. Looks interesting.
"The website isn't up and running yet but there's some activity and info on their FB page.Search for ""Reethi Faru"".John"
Hi all we fly out next Sunday and can't wait. Can anyone confirm luggage limits for the sea plane to reethi. Is it 20kg main and 5kg for hand luggage ?Cheers
"Yes, that's correct. They tend to add the two together, though so that the combined total is 25kg. Any large or wheeled cabin bags will be taken from you at the seaplane check-in desk along with your hold bags so be sure to keep out anything you want handy on the seaplane eg cameras."
