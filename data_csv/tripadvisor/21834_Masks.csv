Anyone know where I can buy some n95 masks? They don’t sell them on-line. Any medical supply stores in LA anyone knows about?
Medical professionals and their organizations need such masks. Please don’t compete with them.
"I heard there might be a directive to wear a mask when put buying groceries.Edited: 10:27 pm, April 01, 2020 "
I don’t know where that “put” came from. It should read when going out to shop for groceries.
"If you read the newer news, some are saying that a mask might be a good thing. This is definitely NOT N95 masks. Nor even a surgical mask. Wrap a bandana over your face or check online for how to make a mask at home. Our PPE equipment must be saved for front line health care workers."
So they are directing me to wear a mask and then i have to pull out a thread and needle and sew one myself or wear a bandanna across my face. Huh?
"Nobody is “directing” you to wear a mask, and certainly not a N95 mask."
There are handmade masks online that you have to wash when you get home. Try Etsy.
"The mask is to keep your ""germs"" from other people. There are some no-sew options you can find on the internet if you don't want to wear a bandanna or buff or something like that."
Ugh! I guess I’ll go to amazon and buy some cotton ones and call it a day. I wish I could buy an n95. I’d feel much safer.
"My favorite top performers, the Koreans, solved this issue, too: https:/…covid-face-mask-shortage.html"
"I'd feel safer if the health professionals who are taking care of the victims can be adequately protected while they're saving lives.And I'd feel safer if everyone else stayed home. .Former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb""The value of the mask isn't necessarily to protect you from getting sick, although it may offer some protection,"" he said. Instead, ""when someone who's infected is wearing a mask, they're much less likely to transmit infection.""He and the surgeon general both made clear that any recommendations for the public would involve simple fabric surgical-style masks, which could even be homemade — not the higher-grade N95 respirator masks used by health care workers on the front lines.""If you are going to wear face covering when you go out, please understand you still don't need an N95 mask,"" Adams said. ""And if you take one of those N95 masks, you could be taking it out of the hands of a health care worker who desperately needs it to care for patients.""https:/…"
"Liars, I hope we get a similar program here in the US. Be nice to go to CVS or Walgreens and buy a good quality mask."
"Scincalifornia, thanks for the etsy recommendation. Very cute masks and same or lower price than amazon. Washable too."
"It’s good to have a spouse who is a quilter. I like my home made. Produced with extra affection.Do wear a mask. My time in Asia underscored what was said in the article.....it is out of respect for everyone else and not just self protection.Above all, stay at home."
"Spap and they are made in Los Angeles. They aren’t as good as the R95 mask but those should be for doctors, nurses and first responders. They aren’t perfect but it’s better than a scarf. I bought two so I always have one ready. Hand wash as soon as your home and then put in a really hot dryer.Edited: 1:21 am, April 02, 2020 "
How was saying N95s should be for our medical professionals “inappropriate”.....huh? This is what was said in #1.
"Maybe something like this?https://www.nydailynews.com/news/new-emergen…Best of luck,Hunt"
"Masks are required in California now, but the directive reads that a scarf will suffice. You won't be allowed into a grocery store without something covering your face."
"ElleB, can you cite a source? I only see Governor Newsom considering guidance on masks. Even LA mayor is only in urging modality."
"I was in a grocery store last night without a mask, and most of the other people there weren't wearing masks, either. That included many of the workers."
"Management decisions....I was at a favorite to many grocer that metered entry but no masks on employees, and I was in a big Korean grocer in which all employees wore masks and gloves behind a plastic guard at the cashier and in which managers took the temperature of employees seemingly regularly....didn’t hang around to see how often. This is in San Diego.I personally favor masks, but fear panic and hoarding and taking from medical professionals’ needs.Stay at home. Socially distance. Wash hands regularly.Edited: 1:34 pm, April 02, 2020 "
"""I find this metric to be confusing ""It's not possible to quote numbers, since there's no testing available to the public. We don't know the numbers, I know many people who are sick and were denied a test. That's probably why the confusion, the numbers aren't representational."
"Rather than look at positive cases, the increase in hospital admissions, the increase of ICU admissions, the increase in intubations tells a lot more. When these numbers doubled every day, or every other day, it was very worrisome. CA doubling rates have been around 4+ days lately IIRC. Looking at positive cases is meaningless. Many experts say that half of the population will have gotten the virus, many of whom won’t know it. And so, because we don’t have enough test kits, and the tests we are doing are very back logged, we must be socially distant.The NYT is tracking every case, updating multiple times a day and making the info available for download if you want to crunch your own numbers."
"I'm only looking at the daily death count to get a sense of the virus's impact. We're up to about 1000 deaths a day, while the average number of pre-coronavirus deaths in the US was about 7500 per day. The problems with testing makes looking at the total number of cases somewhat useless. I'm reading that current projections say we'll have around 2200 deaths per day at the peak, which will occur around the middle of April. I'm also reading that it's currently expected Covid-19 will be 4 to 7 times more lethal than the typical seasonal flu. I won't take those projections as gospel, but they should give a rough idea of where we're going with this. Some people will be alarmed by those numbers, while others won't."
"""I find this metric to be confusing ""It's hard to compare deaths between a city of 50,000 and 1,000,000 if you use actual numbers, so it's very common in statistics to ""normalize"" numbers so they're all on the same scale. If there are 10 deaths in a city of 50,000, then you have 20 deaths per 100,000 people. If you have 100 deaths in a city of 1,000,000, then you have 10 deaths per 100,000 people. Some people will just look at 20 deaths vs. 100 deaths and say things are much worse in the bigger city, but if you rescale everything to a per 100,000 metric, you can see that you have a greater chance of dying in the smaller town."
"Why not get your groceries delivered? I have been doing that for several years now, mainly from Von's but that is just personal preference. Or use Instacart but lead times right now are longer than usual due to demand.The one main drawback for me is that you can't get most stuff from the fresh deli and bakery or you can only get a preset amount, like 1lb of ham or potato salad."
"""Why not get your groceries delivered?""1. There is an added cost. Impossible for someone out of work or low income. 2. SNAP does not cover groceries that are delivered. 3. Additional person touching the food and transporting it in their car."
"""It's hard to compare deaths between a city of 50,000 and 1,000,000 if you use actual numbers, so it's very common in statistics to ""normalize"" numbers so they're all on the same scale. ""Yes, I understand the concept behind couching the numbers 'per 100,000'. My point was: by referring to the number of cases as a simple percentage of the population, it's a lot easier to imagine in one's mind:'2/10ths of 1% of the population infected' is a lot easier to conceive of than ""178 out of 100,000 people"". Both methods normalize the data but how many people can really conceive of how big 178 out of 100,000 is? 2/10ths of 1% doesn't require doing any math!And in the case of West Hollywood, saying that 178 out of every 100,000 people is infected is misleading since there are only 36,000 people in our city (which would translate to 64 people IN TOTAL in our city are infected). Someone going into a market with the concept that there are 178 people sick when there are, in fact, only 64 is misleading since most people (myself included) don't know the population of the area in which they live.And, for those living in the city of L.A., L.A. county reports the number 'by neighborhood' and I'd be surprised if anyone knows how many people live in each neighborhood. Add to that, many of the neighborhoods listed in the L.A. County report are unknown to me and many that I'm familiar with are missing so I'm not sure where the boundaries are of these places. (It would help to have a local map like the one that Johns Hopkins is providing internationally).The good news is: if you look at the Johns Hopkins map today, and click on United States and espy the little yellow 'line chart' in the lower right corner of the page, the curve has definitely started to flatten. It's very minor but it's the first 'clockwise rotation' of this line and if everyone keeps doing what they're doing, we will see the end of this thing."
"Another factor in evaluating risk is that up to 50% of people carrying the virus don't show any symptoms. Which I believe is why they're starting to recommend basic* masks for the public. Assume you're positive and protect others... stay home and when you do go out, wear a mask.*Not the N95 masks, which should be reserved for health care workers and other folks in high-risk situations."
"""Both methods normalize the data but how many people can really conceive of how big 178 out of 100,000 is? 2/10ths of 1% doesn't require doing any math!""I actually find the 178 out of 100,000 easier to understand."
"Even Trump is allowing that there will be 93,000 deaths. Other models, ones which do assume social distancing, are in the 100,000 to 200,000 range. Without social distancing models say well over 1 million dead. Number of deaths alone do not tell the whole story. If hospitals become overwhelmed and there are not enough ventilators for patients who need them, deaths will spike unnecessarily."
"The public generally doesn't know how many people are on or in need of ventilators, which is why I don't use that as a metric."
"San Diego County""Effective midnight Saturday, April 4, all employees who may have contact with the public in any grocery store, pharmacy or drug store, convenience store or gas station shall wear a cloth face covering as described in the California Department of Public Health face covering guidance.""https:/…live-coronavirus-updates-in-san-diego"
Does anyone know where you can get a mask other than ordering them online or making them yourself? I'd hate to have to go out with underwear over my head and covering my mouth.
"Having been an expatriate in Asia for over three decades, I think the folks there are used to masks both to hinder exposure themselves and to avoid spreading to others. Lots of folks out there doing their own masks....including quilting groups....with stuff on sale too or even giveaways to vulnerable populations. Leave the N95s and even surgical masks to medical professionals.But do heed the advice that masks do not prevent and that social distance and hand washing are vital aspects of what you should be doing."
Gov. Cuomo gives out number of people in ICU (which he defines has needing a ventilator) at every daily briefing. He gives total as well as increase from the previous day. Also has charts over time. Hospitalizations is also a good a number and I believe generally readily available across the country.
"Since this is a California forum, here is our state’s site: https://covid19.ca.gov/"
Yours is an extremely generic site link. I trolled through it and did not find numbers per day as I mentioned NY has every day. Newsom does not do numbers every day. (Not a criticism. They have different agendas and NY is in a much different place.)If that site has specifics a link to them directly would be helpful.

The two times I’ve gone out at least a few people have complemented me on it and asked where I bought it. The fashionable hand sewn mask is the new cute purse. Lol. The first batch came in 3 days, handmade in LA, I ordered us 1 more each and we have to wait a week."
My wife’s homemade ones have an outer compatible with the user ....mine is guitars....with a towel or T-shirt middle layer and a solid color inner layer.Ones made by kits by quilting or sewing groups use whatever is supplied by the shops. In San Diego that has been JoAnn’s or Sewing Machines Plus or even private stash through blogs.
Liars ~ thanks for that link.scincalifornia ~ can you share the link to the vendor?
"^^^ @SC Yes, everyone compliments my mask as well. I've given out lots of referrals. My neighbor is also sewing masks to be donated to medical facilities that ask. People can sponsor this, too. The masks for general public use are made of sturdy fabric, but are stylish and colorful, too.My brother, who works as a first responder in another state, liked the look from a photo I sent so much that he ordered a batch for his family!Edited: 10:38 am, April 03, 2020 "
Here's my neighbor's site:https://www.roboro6.com/
"The ones made by quilting and sewing groups are usually for donation and not for sale, but some companies, including in LA fashion district or even a couple here in SD are reportedly making them en masse. Not sure how they are getting around essential service rules....maybe they are getting exceptions. But states outside California don’t have our rules.Very important to wash in hot water. That’s why we each have more than one.....son is an essential employee but thankfully not in a grocery/eatery nor in medical facility, and so my wife prioritized him. We are oldies and stayies."

I'm getting one of those masks with vampire teeth painted on the front.
"Japanese creations are great .....if you can figure out how to use them. For centuries, Japanese use furoshiki....a square piece of cloth as bags with no external ties or buttons but simply tied. Despite close to half a decade in Japan I never did figure it out. But the inventors of origami and furoshiki know their stuff.My wife’s masks initially had too short ties.....she went with cloth ties because they wash better than elastic. Since many of the participants here are apparently craft challenged or don’t have a maker/supplier, the internet has lots of choices. Just make sure the ties work for you."
"Kittygal I shared your friend’s site on my community Facebook page. Someone was looking for masks. She won’t get overwhelmed with orders, I’m in a small town."

"@SC, no worries. She's glad to help folks!"
"Frisco - sorry the hair ties didn't work for you. Alternatives include using cut up panty hoses if you have those. They probably have them at the store. Pantyhose as ties are used for many things like headbands for babies.

Silk scarves work in a pinch. Don't forget sunglasses.

"Number 1 must be read again.Nowadays WHO has announced,N95 mask is for who directly contact with Covid-19 patients/suspect.Surgical mask is using in hospital for other needs.Clothes mask can be using by everyone no matter feel well or unwell.Nowadays WHO has suggested everyone use mask, if go outside from the house.You can also wash the clothes mask with water and soap and do not use disinfectant."
Johns Hopkins University on where masks and other PPE fit in the “hierarchy” of dealing with SARS CoV2: https://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-i…Social distancing and hygiene far more important in public health terms.
"Yes, from the hierarchical pyramid we can know that social/physical distancing is the most effective and mask is the less effective.Nowadays social distancing in Jakarta public transport is good, because many persons work from home, but when more people work from the office, because the Covid-19 become ease, so social distancing cannot be applied well in public transport. So initial April 12, 2020 all passengers must use clothes mask in Trans Jakarta Bus Rapid Transit, MRT, LRT and Commuter Train.Social distancing or isolation can be applied well, if the people are discipline. In Jakarta an Indonesian and a Bulgarian in Lombok near Bali run away from the isolation, but can be found and are taken away by persons used hazmat suit. They afraid with isolation and afraid of death and maybe there are no adequate information about why must be isolated. Isolation is important for the others."
"If you want to discuss the affects in Jakarta please post in that forum. Your last paragraph has zero to do with the United States, much less Los Angeles. (As does much of your post.)"
