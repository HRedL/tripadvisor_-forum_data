"After canceling our plans to visit Maine overnight last month, now we are thinking of a long day's road trip to get our Lobster Roll fill. Leave Boston by 7AM, hit Wiscasset for Red's Eats at opening, and work our way home down the coast. No indoors visits planned (other than a bathroom), just coastal views and lots of sweet lobster.Is that currently allowed? IIRC last time we were considering this it was the overnight aspect that violated the rules."
"Thank you for asking! Sadly, many of your fellow MA residents have just been coming and going as they please for weekend stays (to their summer cottages, camps, etc.) so you may encounter a few ""hairy eyeballs.""Your plan sounds fine. You will probably benefit from reduced traffic and a shorter line at Red's if our recent travels in the area are any indication."
"""The State will allow adults who obtain and receive a negative COVID-19 test from a specimen taken no longer than 72 hours prior to arrival to forgo the 14-day quarantine upon arrival in Maine. ""https:/…keepmainehealthy""14-day quarantine requirement for travel and lodging"" I see the word ""travel"" in the ""Protecting Maine People and Tourists Amidst COVID-19"" directive...I do not see any exemption above for ""coastal views and lots of sweet lobster""Bring evidence of a 72hr negative COVID-19 test and eat all the lobster you want."
Well those are nicely conflicting answers!
"OP,I provided the link to the Protecting Maine People and Tourists Amidst COVID-19 from the governor of Maine. CB gave you what he/she said ""sounds fine"". You decide who is the authority on travel to Maine the Governor or CB."
"So not this?https://www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/mi…Which refers to having to complete the certificate ""This compliance form must be provided to check-in at all Maine lodging, campgrounds, seasonal rentals, overnight camps, and other commercial lodging, such as Airbnb"""
"SwimFan2012: You are 100% accurate. The governor is the final say and the rules are the rules. I said that NT's plan sounded fine because he will not be going in anywhere and, having read his numerous posts elsewhere, I know he will mask up, socially distance and behave himself. As I already noted, MA residents are pouring in and out of Maine and I am guessing that the vast majority of them are not following the testing rules every single time they come in.If it were up to me, absolutely no one would be entering Maine without a negative PCR Covid test taken within the past 72 hours. People are currently testing once they hit Maine, and/or receiving positive test results after they're already here. How is that helpful? However, it's legal if they quarantine until they get their results."
"Thank you, CB.Our plans are 2-3 weeks out and we will be monitoring conditions here and in Maine throughout the upcoming days"
"OP,Per your post # 5 the links both go to the same website just different pages.CB,Your second paragraph in Post 6 is irrelevant. You do not know what the OP will be doing. Perhaps the OP is asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic and spreads COVID-19 in bathrooms, gas stations, restaurant curb-side, etc. The OP is required to have proof of a negative test. The virus will continue to spread with the cavalier attitude here in this tread where mandates do not apply to them. The OP's ""Thank you, CB"" is them looking for affirmation for their trip where none should be given because of the governor's mandates.It is not a wonder that COVID-19 is spiking in many places with the attitudes displayed here !"
"Hate to disagree with CB, but,, in the OP's own words ""No indoors visits planned (other than a bathroom), just coastal views and lots of sweet lobster."" Unless they plan to use the tried-and-true Maine method of stepping behind a big evergreen tree beside the road, that ""indoor bathroom visit"" (anywhere on the Maine coast in the summer) will likely expose them to contact with other people -- the sort of thing the test-or-quarantine is designed to prevent...Northern Traveler -- be aware that CB's comment about a ""hairy eyeball"" because of your MA license plate is probably correct -- especially in light of the recent news that the hospital in Bar Harbor has been contacted by more than 30 out-of-state residents who came to Maine without getting their negative test results before leaving home and without quarantining after they arrived, only to discover, after mingling with family and community members, they had tested positive! Isn't making out-of-state visitors very popular right now..."
"Mainer - I hear you about the restroom issue and I am nervous every time I have to use the turnpike facilities (especially since they still have the hand blow-dryers connected), but let's say NT wanted to come and do the 14-day quarantine without a negative test (a legal option). Would you expect someone to ""hold it"" all the way from Boston to Bar Harbor or Rangeley? Or, understanding that's impossible, would you at least prefer someone who would mask up and follow the rules? I'm going to repeat what I said above - I wish no one was coming without a negative test (and wish there was a realistic turn-around time of 24 hours or less). I actually don't understand why anyone is traveling out of their home areas at this point. However, they are, so I am trying to mitigate the infection rates for those of us who live, shop and walk by those from away."
"I would say no. Unless you know of lobster shacks that deliver, or that will take your order over the phone and deliver your order to the hood of your car, you are not allowed to go out to public places. Restrooms definitely not allowed. There is an allowance to be outside for exercise, with a mask on if there are others around, but I don't think standing in line at a lobster shack is considered exercise. https:/…frequently-asked-questions.pdf(The rules are on page 12)"
