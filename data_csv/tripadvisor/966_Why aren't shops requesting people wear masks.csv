"I see so many people not wearing masks on videos of Gatlinburg. I realize that many people see this as being against their constitutional rights but stores can say no mask...no service. I live in Indiana and you cannot go in some stores without a mask. Trust me, they are no where near as busy as Gatlinburg!I was really hoping people would be more considerate."
"My ""guess"" would be in two parts:1. Smaller store owners are not wanting to discourage people entering their stores.2. Some may see it as a safety concern for themselves and their employees. The number of incidents with violence and threats by people demanding their ""Constitutional rights"" are being violated are increasing. A security guard was shot and killed in Michigan, restaurant workers have been threatened, including one threatened with a weapon, in Stillwater, Oklahoma, and just yesterday, two restaurant workers were shot in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma."
I plan on wearing a mask. I was tested for Coronavirus but it was negative. I still feel safer wearing the mask.
"Honestly, from a personal standpoint, I HATE THOSE MASKS!! And, I wouldn't personally patronize a business that ""insists"" on me wearing a mask to enter the establishment, like Costco is doing. That's my personal feelings about it, but I'm not saying others should feel the same way.I firmly believe it's a personal choice. If you don't feel safe around folks who are not wearing masks, you can make the choice to avoid them, but I don't believe in ""forcing"" everyone to do something so personal."
"Personally, I have no issue with businesses that make a choice to look after their employees, as well as their customers. It's not always easy to avoid people who are making no effort to be safe (social distancing, masks, etc.)."
"Hmmm...no shirt no shoes no service. Why not add no mask no service? I am so sick of selfish, self centered people."
"While you are tired of people not wearing a mask because you “think” they should, perhaps you should not not worry about the other person. In Tennessee it is recommended and NOT required. Until that becomes the case, it is a choice. No amount of shaming should be allowed to make a person feel like they should wear one. If you choose to wear one for your health, please wear one. If someone chooses not to, please respect their decision.Edited: 11:53 pm, May 07, 2020 "
It's easy to say that people shouldn't worry about others when it's unsafe practices by complete strangers that can cause someone to be infected with the virus.
"I wear a mask in places that I know will be crowded. I don't wear one when going somewhere like the auto parts store where there are few people and social distancing seems to work. Yes I hate them too and so over this entire mess. But we have to get through this. We have some places that are requiring them here where I live but most do not but all of our smaller shops have not opened up yet. We see about 1/2 of the people wearing them when we do go somewhere like Home Depot. Also if they don't keep the mask sanitary or replace it when they should all its doing is carrying around germs. I imagine only about 1/2 of the people wearing them bother to sanitize them, I have seen some pretty dirty looking masks and other garments they are wearing as masks. Its pretty gross."
"No smoking laws were created for both employees and patrons to have smoke-free environments to work / be a customer without having to deal with second-hand smoke. To me, the effects of COVID-19 are far more risky on a limited basis than second-hand smoke.Just an observation."
"Reid makes a good point about the complete stranger being the cause for somebody getting infected. A key point to remember is that the potential benefit of wearing a mask is to safeguard those around you (maybe even more so than even protecting yourself). You might not have been exposed and are not an asymptomatic carrier, but the mask would significantly reduce spreading virus to others if you had been previously infected.With that thought in mind, I could also see some places adopting a ""no mask / no service"" policy (if and when applicable). Much like most places prohibit smoking because of the potential harm of secondhand effects to others, the concern of ""secondhand"" viral exposure could be a legitimate reason to require protective measures. Having said all that, I also dislike wearing a mask. They tend to be uncomfortable and even distracting, but I feel the potential benefit of reducing exposure to others outweighs my personal discomfort...but that's just my own thought and opinion."
I just got back from my local Kroger grocery store and everyone had on a mask except 1 person.It's not mandatory but I was glad to see people doing the right thing and staying safe.
"Dr_xaos- "" Having said all that, I also dislike wearing a mask. They tend to be uncomfortable and even distracting, but I feel the potential benefit of reducing exposure to others outweighs my personal discomfort...but that's just my own thought and opinion""Absolutely agree! If everyone felt like that the world would be a better place. I just heard yesterday that when we talk droplets come out and they linger in the air for I don't know how long so keep your droplets to yourself! :)Employees being shot because they ask you to wear a mask is appalling!"
"I am a regular platelets donor; I donate every couple of weeks at the American Red Cross. The process takes nearly 3 hours from the time I enter the building until I leave. In addition to pre-screening, they implemented mandatory face coverings a couple of weeks ago in order to reduce exposure should someone be asymptomatic, but positive for COVID-19. I also have an ""essential"" job and have to be temperature checked before I enter the building and wear a mask in public spaces in my office building. It's amazing what you can ""endure"" while ""helping"" others instead of being only concerned about yourself."
"5cheers, I agree 100 percent. It's not about one's personal self; it's about other people - especially senior citizens and those with weakened immune systems.It's horrifying to see people being physically threatened, sometimes with weapons, let alone SHOT, for simply enforcing rules they didn't make. You really have to wonder about some people in this world."
"Well, I hope they do not require a mask. If they do, we will cancel our June vacation. We will spend our money elsewhere. Our local Menards is now requiring masks to shop there, so we are now no longer shopping there. The Lowes in our town does not and it has never been busier.What makes us angry is the fact that older adults are at the highest risk. My husband is a commercial contractor and is in hardware stores often throughout the week. He has never seen as many older adults shopping in the stores and not wearing masks. But the store banned kids under 16, making it hard for single parents to shop since Grandma and Grandpa cannot babysit anymore. My high school senior has given up her senior year and my two younger children cannot see their friends due to the lockdown but the older citizens that are at high risk that all these rules are trying to protect, won't stay home or wear masks. We live in a county where there have been 7 cases, 4 of which have recovered (no deaths). Just like most of the people replying to this posting that think people are being rude and selfish for not wearing a mask, I can say the same to the older adults who refuse to stay home and let the rest of us go on with life.If you are scared or at high risk, please feel free to stay home. Just like my family will stay home ( or travel elsewhere) if masks become required.This is a tough time for everyone. Where we live most people are essential workers, but nurses and hospital workers are the ones being furloughed due to no work. That's the other thing everyone needs to remember, not everywhere is being affected the same. We have quite a few counties around us that still have zero cases. Turn off the tv, the news media is doing a disservice to Americans right now. Everything under the sun is a symptom, and they have been caught creating false reports and making things look worse during their reporting."
"That is still not the point. You can be a symptomatic and still infect others. The masks primarily keep the person wearing it from spreading the disease. Telling certain groups they have to stay home so others can go about their daily lives without any concern whatsoever for the health and well-being of others is, in my opinion, both selfish and disgusting."
"Judgemental, the problem in our country. But calling me disgusting and selfish won't force me into changing my views. Sometimes people need to not be so quick to judge. Did you ever think about the people who are claustrophobic or are asthmatic? I'm both, so technically high risk as well. I cannot wear a mask due to both of these issues. But that doesn't mean I think others are nuts for wearing them in the stores. I believe they have all the rights that our constitution has allowed them. I just wish that went both ways sometimes.I will go on without wearing a mask and will deal with whatever that means. I just hope for everyone's sake this blows over fast. We have enough division in the country, I don't think we can afford more, especially with the shutdown collapsing our economy.Have a good day, and please before you judge and call people disgusting, realize that you have no idea what is going on in their lives."
"I'm truly shocked at the number of grown adults acting like stubborn babies. We are all subjected to ""dress codes"" every day. This is life. Do you whine this much about having to wear shirt/shoes in the store? This is a serious health issue right now. People are sick and dying, including the healthcare workers who are having to deal with the fallout of people like you who refuse to wear masks."
I agree with Kitten. Well said!
"There is no ""Constitutional right"" not to wear a mask, In fact, states actually do have a legal right to do what is deemed necessary to protect the masses. And for the record, please read the comment again. I said the act of ""telling certain groups they have to stay home so others can go about their daily lives without any concern whatsoever for the health and well-being of others"" is what is selfish and disgusting; I was describing an act/attitude, not a person.Kitten, very, very well said."
"The best to everyone on the forums. I will not let fear rule my life, nor do I believe that we need to cater to the minority. Maybe Sweeden had the right idea.To everyone here, you have a right to your thoughts, just as I do. I just dont agree with the government's approach to this. Have a good evening."
"If looking after the elderly and those who have compromised immune systems is ""catering to the minority,"" then guilty as charged. It's not about ""fear"" ruling your life; it's about having some consideration about the welfare of others."
"Nobody is going to change anybody else's opinions on views like these. Denigrating, shaming and arguing are pointless efforts and only anger each other like talking about guns and politics. Humans are independent, thinking beings of free will and I hope we all stay that way."
We are seeing very few people wearing mask! So not only not wearing mask we see people standing about on top of each other in lines. So much for social distancing! I guess people don't care that they may start shutting things down again if people can't be considerate of others.
I certainly don't have a problem telling people to back up 6ft from me and stay in their own lane.I will be wearing my mask when I am around people. I will not wear it in my hotel room or truck. That's just weird.
"5cheers, what you are describing is exactly what many people were afraid would happen."
When everything is shut down again the * no maskers* will be the ones whining the loudest. They just don't get it. Wear a mask and social distance folks so we can hopefully get over this mess.
"I am so confused as to why wearing a piece of paper on your face when you're around people is such an issue. People are acting like it is the end of the world because we are having to wear a mask for a few minutes a day or two a week we are out in public... However, I guess we really shouldn't trust scientists and doctors, and instead trust Dr. Oz or whoever is saying we don't need to wear masks to decrease the spread of this thing.With that being said - I'm looking forward to my trip to GBurg. If everything is shut down, all the better. I will thoroughly enjoy sitting in my cabin, enjoying the hot tub, and doing nothing for a whole week."

"Unfortunately this “mask or no mask” issue could be argued forever. When all of this first started I was ok with the lockdown, face coverings, etc. but as time goes on the mandates have become simply too much. The WHO changes its advise daily....not that, in my opinion, they can be trusted at all. Most doctors I have seen...and that’s quite a few...agree this is pretty much an over hyped flu. Yes it is contagious but then so are many other things. The media is leading us around like sheep on this issue. Notice during all the “peaceful “ riots there has been little to no mention of Covid-19? But I digress...check with your health officials. Wearing a mask all day is not healthy either.....especially when you spend most of the time adjusting it or wearing a mask that is not clean. If you want to wear a mask wear one. If you don’t then don’t. Just use common sense and keep a fair distance away from each other. I personally have no desire to spend my hard earned money traveling to any place where I am required to wear a mask in every place I go. If you do, that is your privilege."
"On Thursday May 21, prior to the Memorial Day weekend, there was 1 active case in Sevier County. The average at the time had been 3-4 new cases per week, and recoveries. The latest data released yesterday, June 12, shows 93 active cases. For more info see https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g20533…The Tennessee Pledge requests that everyone—residents or guests—wear a mask in public, keep 6 feet apart, and practice good hygiene. While the Governor does not want to mandate this, he has stated he is trusting everyone to do this.The headlines across the country today are concerned about the nationwide spike in cases over the last 3 weeks.Edited: 9:13 am, June 13, 2020 "
I think uf you visit an area you should be mindful of the local population and keep them safe. Tourist are bringing in the virus and do not seem to care. Wearing a mask to help protect the local population is being responsible and considerate.
Thanks for posting this CRinTN. I think it’s a good wake-up call. People tend to forget that bad things can happen on vacation. We will be wearing our masks and taking appropriate precautions when we visit in July. Looking forward to our first trip to Gatlinburg!
Interesting discussion. If I was traveling or had to go out then I would wear a mask. Wear one anyway during pollen season to cut grass.My husband is at very very high risk so I must be very careful. We have not been more than 2 miles to drive thru pharmacy since early March. We don't travel (already cancelled several national park trips) and can't even visit our grandchildren. All groceries and supplies are thru contactless delivery.With the seriousness ( and yes very deadly nature) of the Coronavirus a mask if I did go out is simply like wearing shoes or clothes which are required to enter a store.
It sounds like you should not be travelling. High risk families should stay put. You will see fewer and fewer people with masks when you do venture out.

"Remember most of those people are from ""somewhere else"" and don't care. About 80% are from New York...North Carolina....Florida....Alabama....Texas etc. They come have fun and leave!!!!!"
"Today, Governor Lee extended the state of emergency in TN until August 29. The new Executive Order extends the previous one. At https://www.tn.gov/governor/news/2020/6/29/g…there's a list of extended provisions. Second on the list is* Urge persons to wear a cloth face covering in places where in close proximity to others;"
"""urges"" is not much different than ""recommends."" I don't anticipate this new order will in any way change the percentage of folks wearing masks in the Gatlinburg area.Edited: 7:41 pm, June 29, 2020 "
"To dislike wearing a mask is being reckless and careless.What about many others who are trying to be safe and careful.It is selfish to just think about yourself and all others who are trying to stay well.None us like wearing the mask, but this is a very real problem and you should rethink your actions.Thank you for your consideration."

Sevier County leaders met with business owners today to discuss this. Here’s the news story: https:/…
"Here’s WATE News’ story about the meeting with Sevier County leaders and business owners: https:/…County Mayor Waters is continuing to urge tourists to wear a mask and practice social distancing and good hygiene. They want to be clear this is the expectation, even though mandates have to come from the state level. They had this meeting in advance of the 4th of July holiday, in hopes that businesses will be able to relay the message to guests."
"Agree that the mask issue is an unresolvable debate.... I don’t even agree with my own kids on it. So I don’t go places where people aren’t wearing masks and social distancing. That being said, if a business says they do require masks and distancing then I wish they’d enforce it. If they don’t have a mask requirement then my expectation is that people won’t be wearing masks and I don’t go there. The idea of “urging “ people to wear masks is fruitless because even if most wear masks and some don’t then you are exposed. I’m not debating mask or no mask..... I’m saying that it’s your choice to go where people aren’t wearing masks. I agree that you should stay home if you are concerned about being exposed to those not wearing masks"
"Sadly, had the safety protocols of the Tennessee Pledge been emphasized from Day 1, this might not have happened (TN added to Tri-State Advisory): https://www.wbir.com/article/news/health/cor…I applaud Sevier County leaders for meeting yesterday, but really wish the State had helped them with this from the beginning if they were going to rely on businesses to carry the load of messaging to tourists.Edited: 12:46 pm, June 30, 2020 "
"It's not about being considerate or being a ""jerk"" (insert your own adjective here). This a matter of public health and safety. Wearing a mask reduces everyone's chances of contracting what can be a fatal infection. Unfortunately this message is not being transmitted from the person holding the highest office in the land. We were in Gatlinburg last week & drove down the strip. I counted TEN masks in that entire strip. We opted to not stop anywhere in town for that very reason. I work in healthcare & I can tell you that many people have died from this virus & many, many more will do so before this is all said and done. Be safe & protect yourself."
"We are on a continual rise daily in Tennessee.. I live near Nashville. I went with my family to pigeon forge/Gatlinburg last week and maybe 5% had masks on everywhere some business owners didn’t even wear them but most did. It was as busy as it was pre covid other than the few masks and the limited seating only in some places most were not limited or spaced and the stickers in places for lines being 6 feet Apart you’d never know a pandemic was happening Check out this article from Tennessean:Vanderbilt: In East Tennessee, coronavirus is spreading fast to older residentshttps:/…"
"People with businesses cannot ""stay home"". I am over 65 and have chosen not to travel but locals do not have that option. They need to make a living. They run the risk of covid but if people were to wear masks, their exposure would be less. We can open the economy and be safe...we just need to be smart about it."
I find it interesting that an account was created in May with the sole purpose of arguing against the COVID-19 safety precautions on the Gatlinburg forum.
"For those interested this morning, I have been informed that where I live, we are being required to wear facemarks when entering public space. The supermarket where I shop has a sigh out front in the control lane that specifically states that you must wear a facemask to enter this business store.On further reading the article, it specifically states that those caught violating the given rule of law, you can be fined $500.00 and maybe some time in jail. In an adjacent area these people are being told to stay at home except for personal business like specific appointments.This can be done in GB."
"In this afternoon’s press briefing, Governor Lee made his strongest statements yet as today marked an all-time daily high in cases, with 1,806 more statewide today than yesterday. He urged Tennesseans “….don’t put our state two steps backward by refusing to wear a mask or (practice social distancing) . . .” He said he was asking everyone “to get us back on track by wearing a mask” and the Health Director also implored everyone to wear a mask and practice good hygiene and social distancing.He acknowledged that mask mandates are a hot topic and said that local governments (outside of the 6 counties with their own health departments) and other areas are asking how to make local mask mandates, and that he is exploring the authority they would have to do that. He expects to have guidance on that very soon. So, it looks like there’s a possibility Sevier County may be given authority to make their own ordinances soon.Edited: 4:51 pm, July 01, 2020 "
"Here’s more on Governor Lee’s comments today regarding potentially granting local communities more authority: https://www.wbir.com/mobile/article/news/loc…Edited: 8:09 pm, July 01, 2020 "
"So, CRinTN, just to make sure I understand correctly, Gov. Lee is not willing to issue a mandate to wear masks in public, but he is willing to try to assist local authorities with doing so?"
"ReidAdair,That’s correct. He said he is not considering a state-wide mandate at this time, in part because there are many counties that are doing well, as he doesn’t want a one-size-fits-all approach. But he issued his strongest statements yet about adhering to safety protocols and said he would have a resolution soon to the requests by various local city and county leaders throughout the state that want to do more.Both he and the Health Director expressed concern for Sevier County, but lumped it with other rural areas without mentioning the tourism factor. Yet Sevier County is unlike most small towns in that it gets more visitors than just about anywhere else.Edited: 9:32 pm, July 01, 2020 "
"John S, you claim you didn’t join to argue about masks and you’ve posted about other things. You have 27 posts and only 5 of them don’t talk about masks or the virus ...... and you didn’t posts those for a few weeks after you joined.....JS"

"Respectfully John, I do live nearby and have many family members who live and work in Gatlinburg. Wearing masks is not synonymous with ""closing the economy"" and rioting has no place in this discussion. There's really no need to be inflammatory with the scenarios you're throwing around.Starting tomorrow in Knoxville, masks are required in all indoor public spaces, subject to fine. While Knoxville originally had autonomy on making all of their own decisions, they aligned with the statewide ""Tennessee Pledge"" earlier this week. This is an example of a post upthread about Gov. Lee saying the state would ""assist"" in helping communities who wanted to mandate mask wearing. It is not unfathomable that Sevier County communities might do the same.Contrary to John's sentiments, I say if you want to help keep the local economy in Gatlinburg healthy, just wear the dang mask so that you can get out and about and support businesses. There's no on/off switch to this scenario."

"Governor Lee has just signed a new Executive Order granting authority to county mayors to mandate masks, if they choose. Here's more: https://www.wsmv.com/news/gov-bill-lee-grant…"
"CRinTN, it will be interesting to see how this progresses. I believe I saw either Knoxville (city) and/or Knox County mandated masks, if I'm not mistaken."
"ReidAdair,Yes, Knox County passed a mandate earlier this week, as they have their own health department. Here is a Press Release from Sevier County Government:“JULY 3, 2020 -  SEVIER COUNTY UPDATE:Today, Governor Lee issued Executive Order 54, which grants certain county mayors, including Sevier County’s, the authority to issue COVID-19 mask requirements. City and county leaders are consulting with the Sevier County Health Department and legal counsel to determine the implementation of this order in Sevier County. We hope to have a determination by Monday based on those consultations.” https:/…press-releases.html"
"I personally have had the Covid 19 and I still believe it should be up to the individual. If you feel at risk, stay home. If you want to wear a mask then be my guest. I do not want one....I have been tested with the antibodies (now discussions are how long they last) but why would I need to wear a mask? Just to make others feel good? Wearing a mask for covid19 is like Smoking a cigarette with a filter....it really doesn’t protect you."
At least put up a sign and make an effort to protect the people that did choose to enter your shop and support your business. People are dying daily with this virus and they had rights too. Don't be so selfish and think of others....it won't kill...or maybe it will or your loved one.
"And that is exactly why ATLANTA is a ""hotspot"" and GA has the highest death rates of any, ANY state. 257 kids test positive in 1 weekend in Fulton Co. 11 died. They didn't have a choice. You could be a-symptomatic and carrying the antigens and spreading it and not even know it."
