"It seems that from tomorrow, each passenger arriving from a high risk country, and staying more than 10 days, will be tested two times: one at the border, and a second time after 4-6 days.This is due to the recent rise of Covid-19 infections in Iceland.Does anyone knows if the second test can be done elsewhere than the Reykjavik area?News in icelandic about the new rules:https:/…hertar-adgerdir-i-tiu-lidumEnglishhttps:/…Edited: 8:31 am, July 30, 2020 "
"The 10 days rule... Anyone know if its based on 10 x 24 hours, or 10 days counting arrival and departure day?"
"Here's an official statement today on the Government of Iceland website (in English):https:/…The double checking only applies to new arrivals from July 31st. For those of us who already in Iceland there seems to be no requirement for a second test. I'm currently in East Iceland and while I'd be happy to be retested if the government felt it was necessary, it might be difficult to arrange.Note also that 2 meter social distancing rules are back. So some museums, clubs, etc may need to close.The two COVID-19 testing labs are both in Reykjavik. Presumably the government must have some means of testing Icelanders at other locations who fall ill and getting the samples back to Reykjavik, but it isn't yet clear if they will do anything for tourists who are traveling.dahokolomok: Unfortunately immigration officers normally count arriving and departing days as full days. Unless we hear something different I think it's safest to assume they will do the same here.Edited: 11:01 am, July 30, 2020 "
The 2nd test is free of charge and testing is available at health care services all over the country.https://www.landlaeknir.is/servlet/file/store93/item42251/Hygiene%20measures%20on%20return%20to%20ICE_Heimkomusmitgát%2027.7.20%20%20ENGL.pdf
"What's the list of countries that are defined as ""high risk areas"" that need to do the second test?"
"Wosco, second test at ""any health care service all over the country"":This is a cut and past from the link below:""As of 31 July, all passengers arriving in Iceland from high-risk areas who intend to stay in Iceland for 10 days or more have to undergo two PCR-tests. The 1st is at the border on arrival and the 2nd by the primary health care service 4-6 days later. In between the two tests special precautions need to be taken. The 2nd test is free of charge and testing is available at health care services all over the country.""I don't believe there is an actual list of ""high risk"" countries. Right now, all countries are high risk, with 6 exceptions: Greenland, Faroe Islands, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Germany. These 6 countries are the only ones exempt from a covid-19 test upon arrival in Iceland, and I believe are exempt from the follow up test.But obviously things are changing as the infections increase in Iceland. This could all change shortly.Here is the source link, scroll down to the botton half for English:https://www.landlaeknir.is/um-embaettid/grei…Sorry to see this happening in Iceland. They have done a wonderful job so far; hope they can controlthis outbreak."
@perivinkl and @drr49Thank you for the informations. I was worried I had to go back to Reykjavik for the second test...Let's hope things will settle down in this wonderful country.
"Tourists have taken the virus all over the world. They will continue to do it, even with testing on entry."
"Hi all,I found this a list of locations where there's testing in other parts of Iceland. However it says you need an appontmentweb: https:/…20ENGL.pdftext ""In the Reykjavik area testing is performed at Suðurlandsbraut 34, 108 Reykjavík, ground floor,between 10:00 and 15:00 Monday to Friday, and between 12:00 til 15:00 on weekends and holidays.No appointments are made. An ID such as a passport needs to be presented. Registration is linked tothe 1st test and those that are automatically notified will receive a barcode by email but others will beregistered on-site.Outside the Reykjavik area an appointment needs to be made with the primary health care service ata center that perform border testing and can register travellers for the 2nd test (listed below): Suðurnes (HSS) Selfoss (HSU) Vestmannaeyjar (HSU) Höfn í Hornafirði (HSU) Egilsstaðir (HSA) Akureyri (HSN) Ísafjörður (HVEST) Borgarnes (HVE) Stykkishólmur (HVE)""does anybody know how to book an appointment in one of these places?thanks!"

@mathladyca49Of course! But since we were talking about Iceland here...
"@JulesInSwindon, I agree with your assesment of how things will go on your trip. You will have the one test upon arrival, wait the 24 hrs, and if no message, you are free to travel until you depart the next Sunday.But, as you say, with this recent infection flare up, things can change. It was that a positive first test would have you come in for a second test (for antibodies). If antibodies are present, you are free to go; no antibodies and you quarantine for 14 days. There was a hotel in Reykjavik for quarantine purposes, and paid for by Iceland. Not sure, but would guess these procedures are in place for those visitors in Iceland for 10 days or longer, and test positive on the second test. Which would be a major change to what was planned. But the folks running the covid-19 program in Iceland really know how best to handle this recent outbreak. I wish them continued sucess in defeating this virus.Hope you have a wonderful trip to Iceland. Wish I could go, but it will be some time before that is even a possibility for the US."
Here are some vegetarian options in Reykjavík:https:/…vegan-vegetarian-guide-to-reykjavikI would see if they have their menu online and call ahead to order to you can just pick up your meal and be on your way. Plus you'll be sure if they are open before you go.
"I do not understand your reasoning for staying in Reykjavik and doing the Golden Circle. These places have the highest concentration of tourists and the densest population, while in the countryside there is hardly anyone around. You can get into your car at the airport and head out there, maybe staying in a self contained cottage and do outings locally while waiting.South coast like Jøkulsarlon and the large waterfalls also attracted many tourists, while more off the beaten path hardly any tourists at all.And why not do self catering rather than relying on take-outs ? The vegan restaurant across the street where we stayed were closed two weeks ago."
"@drr49 thanks, the second opinion is welcome!@Kim T - thanks to you too, it was really recent 'on the ground' info I was after. But our plan will be to do just as you say.@klimaflyktning - our holiday priorities this time around are very simple. We know we will come back to Iceland in future, probably more than once, and when we do, we'll do our more usual form of travel which is more adventurous and more on the move. On this occasion, having been within a few kilometres of our own home for the overwhelming majority of the last 5 months, just being able to be somewhere different, where in fact the density of people and tourists will be lower than at home, will be enough. We have both been working incredibly hard and even now, a week away from our trip it's by no means certain we will feel able to come. we have deliberately kept it simple and booked the same hotel we had last time on a cancellable rate; our flights which were mostly paid for by vouchers from refunds from trips to other places cancelled due to COVID, and our car hire which again is cancellable rate and the same place we hired from last time. We want to invest as little thought in the actual trip part of it as possible, focusing only on what we need to do and know for COVID. We have a few ideas about what we want to do and we'll definitely do some different things, but merely the absence of living by the clock in 30 to 1 hour back to back video meetings, and the ability to be somewhere different, will be a massive holiday for us. We'd love to visit the Golden Circle areas at a different time of year, particularly Thingvillir which was total white-out the last time we visited. And driving there in our own hire car at the current time, I'm confident we'll not feel like anywhere is crowded! for us, this is by far the least stressful thing to do. Food-wise, we'll have some basic facilities and a fridge so we'll be fine for breakfast and packed lunches. If we end up similar for dinner, that's no big deal. But actually, eating some meals we HAVEN'T had to prepare for ourselves will be a very big bonus bearing in mind our lockdown. In summary, what is a priority for you on a trip is clearly different to what is a priority for us on this occasion!"
"Hi, I was wondering if you found an answer to this question yet. I will be there for 9 days end of August. If I count the calender days it would be 10 days.Edited: 8:15 am, August 05, 2020 "
"I sent my question about testing on arrival to this e-mail address, and they replied the same day:mottaka@landlaeknir.is"
"You didn't upset me, but it might be worth considering that a) it's generally fine for other people to have different priorities to you on a holiday and particularly b) at the moment, anyone you're 'talking to' might have very different motivations than usual. In our case, watching whilst one's government makes every single bad decision possible resulting in scores of thousands of unnecessary deaths (still averaging over 60 deaths *every day*) has not been a fun experience. Getting away from it to any degree is enough.Thanks for the link: the ECDC daily and weekly reports are some of the (many) data sources I've been watching daily for weeks. Iceland's incidence per 100k overtook the UK's several days ago, having shot up from <5 to >20 in a matter of days, but given the significant difference in population sizes this is not the only relevant factor (and that is likely why the UK hasn't - yet - started making noises about quarantining arrivals from Iceland, as it has Spain. As for our trip, we're currently about 50/50 whether we will come or not and plan to make the decision on Friday, for traveling early on Sunday.Such is the nature of travel in a pandemic... and why it's best not to get one's heart set on any particular plan."
"@JulesInSwindon, fellow londoner here trying to assess the situation. considering flying out 19th for 9 days. most of our travel will be off the beaten path, but we're conscious that a downward spiral might impact our entry into iceland and re-entry into UK. more news seems to be coming through today. FYI RUV's english site: https://www.ruv.is/english"
"@JulesInSwindon, rooting for you because we are in a very similar position (though without being able to say we've worked very hard during lockdown). It's going to be our first time and while researching the trip has been a bit overwhelming given Iceland's abundant beauty spots, like you if it happens it happens..Edited: 12:16 pm, August 06, 2020 "
"Jules, I know you are still anxious about this decision. I was a bag of nerves before our recent trip. We are all just guessing but my gut feeling is that it is not likely that Iceland will go the way of Spain when it comes to quarantine on return. Several reasons, but a major one is that it just does not seem to be on the UK government's radar as a holiday destination or one where the numbers of travellers either way matter too much.I think the only way it would happen would be if there is a blanket ban on travel abroad and I don't think that is a high risk in this time frame. I am watching this topic for my friend who is also going to Iceland with her kids for 2 weeks soon.Up to you but having been lucky enough to have had my trip recently I would go for it even if it had been from now. Once you arrive you will feel so relaxed in the great Icelandic outdoors and it will be so worth the pre-travel stress."
"We are at the end of day 5 in Iceland now and still had no info on the second test. The leaflet said they would email us. I checked the official stats and there were zero cases from incoming tourists the day we arrived, so that’s a relief. There was the very small risk I could have been sat within a row of someone with a positive test.We saw the Icelandic Lava Show in Vik last night and they provided face masks which was quite uncomfortable because of the heat from the lava. I understood though, because it’s inside. However, I’ve today had an email from the whale watching trips I’ve booked in Husavik and we will have to wear masks on the boat, which seems very odd given it’s technically outside. They’re also no longer providing the warm overalls so we need to be prepared with warm hats, gloves, coats etc, and also not providing refreshments on the tour."
Make sure you bring several layers of warm clothes with windproof jacket and ideally pants. It can get seriously cold on the boat.
"Hi @CaramelCruffinWe are in a similar position. Hope you can answer a couple of questions as it is a bit vague about what to do now we are here.We are staying for 12 days and under impression we need to get test as we are staying 10+ days.Did you stay 10+ days and did you get notified about your first test? Did you go to a clinic to get the second one or not bother because of lack of contact via the app/ email? Thank you or anyone else for more info about the second test.Edited: 5:09 pm, August 11, 2020 "
"@frankied Apparently the gov don’t count your arrival and departure days in trip count, so you might be fine. There’s an email address to confirm in this tripadvisor thread: ‘Iceland trip and need for second covid test’Edited: 5:29 pm, August 11, 2020 "
"I thought rule was 10 or more days. Excluding the day of arrival and departure.Anyone else worried about the proposals with regard to quarantine? Test 1, 4-6 days quarantine, test 2."
"About the possibility of making tourists quarantine until the second test: they said today that would take time to implement so I don't think it will happen with short notice. If things keep improving over the new few weeks, they will relax more restrictions. I'm due to arrive on Sept 8 for 3 weeks so hopefully things are good!"
"We arrived 2nd August in the morning, and leave 14th in the morning, so even excluding both travel days, it’s still 11 days and didn’t get contacted for a second test. A few days ago we briefly chatted to another Brit couple and they hadn’t been contacted either. I’m assuming they don’t have the testing capacity at the moment, but could be wrong.Based on the location of testing health centres, we could have made an appointment in Hofn or Egilsstadir without much disruption to our plans, but again, I wasn’t going to make contact as they said they would contact us. We’ve had mobiles on, which they used to text us the arrival test negative result, and email which they used to send the test barcodes. So we’ve not avoided it, I’m just not going to chase them."
