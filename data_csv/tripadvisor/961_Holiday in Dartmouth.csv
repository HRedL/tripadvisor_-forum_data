HiWe have a holiday booked to Dartmouth on 4th April for a week. This is obviously just after the 2 week social distancing guidelines from the government but this is a fluid situation. We have a self catering house and understand we probably wouldn’t be able to do all the activities we would normally but I was wondering what people’s thoughts are regarding whether we should still come or cancel? Are there still holiday makers in Dartmouth? Are grocery shops still open and stocked? Are cafes and restaurants offering takeaway services? We are in two minds and really could do with some local guidance. Thanks in advance
"I think you may have misunderstood ... the 14 days period is self isolation after contracting, or suspecting, COVID-19. I will not be holidaying anywhere until much later and only when Government advice changesUntil further notice we are advised to practice social distancing: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/c… ""What is social distancing?Social distancing measures are steps you can take to reduce the social interaction between people. This will help reduce the transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19).They are:Avoid contact with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19). These symptoms include high temperature and/or new and continuous coughAvoid non-essential use of public transport, varying your travel times to avoid rush hour, when possibleWork from home, where possible. Your employer should support you to do this. Please refer to employer guidance for more informationAvoid large gatherings, and gatherings in smaller public spaces such as pubs, cinemas, restaurants, theatres, bars, clubsAvoid gatherings with friends and family. Keep in touch using remote technology such as phone, internet, and social mediaUse telephone or online services to contact your GP or other essential servicesEveryone should be trying to follow these measures as much as is pragmatic."
"I'm in the United States watching our own virus crisis explode. We have reservations for a UK trip in October...that seems a long time from now, but if this keeps getting a lot worse...even though it will eventually get better/fingers crossed....we may just have to cancel our trip. Been really looking forward to Dartmouth...."
"Things are changing very quickly indeed. I'd have absolutely no expectation of going anywhere at all in April, maybe not until much later in the year or even next year.I realise that you asked this question three days ago, which is a hell of a long time in the current crisis, so hopefully you now have a different view of the way things are going."
"I hope you have decided to cancel, if not, what part of the Government’s advice against all ‘non essential travel’ do you not understand? Holidays and short breaks are non essential travel.If morons keep travelling we will surely end up with a total lockdown. Play your part stay at home and social distance. If we all play our part we may defeat this awful virus.Sorry this sounds harsh but I’m fed up with people thinking the rules apply to them."
"The government has advised against non-essential travel to destinations abroad, however I've not yet seen anything regarding travel within the UK (with the exception of using public transport). I may have missed this, of course. In any case, I wouldn't be too surprised if we do end up on a countrywide lockdown at some point. It's a bit of a waiting game really..."
"Did you not see the Chancellor at Friday's News Conference standing at a podium with ""Stay at Home"" on the front?"
"""If morons keep travelling we will surely end up with a total lockdown.""Of course if the money obsessed businesses offered refunds or rebooking then people wouldnt travel.The ""we are all in this together"" clearly doesn't apply to business owners."
"The only person to blame for travelling during this time is the idiot who decides to travel.Unfortunately there seem to be rather a lot of them about,"
UPDATE- some lovely kind comments on here(sarcasm!) so thanks very much!!This question was posed before The full “stay at home” message came to light obviously with this being and extremely fluid situation over the last week. For those who are interested we have obviously cancelled and rearranged for next year. For those who like to call people idiots....wind your neck in and remember #bekind in these uncertain times!!!
"No, I didn't watch his speech. And I still haven't heard that non-essential travel in your own vehicle is not permitted."
# Sorry - I did not intend to suggest that you were an idiot!I was responding to post #7 which was blaming business owners who did not offer refunds for the fact that people were still travelling.Clearly you are not that stupid and I must admit that I find it difficult to accept that people would travel just because they couldn't get a refund.
"For those who might be interested, the government has now provided clarity. According to the ""Covid-19 essential travel guidance within the UK"" page people should not be travelling to holiday premises, including second homes.https:/…covid-19-essential-travel-guidance"
"I pulled the plug in March and cancelled our trip from the U.S. to the UK. Too many concerns about virus health, and the U.S. is facing huge unemployment and a terrible economy, now it's national protests over police brutality. Terrible times."
