"I'm travelling to Sri Lanka in a few weeks and I'm nervous about the record numbers of dengue fever over the summer. I understand that it is coming into the dry season so it should be less of an issue, but how bad is it going to be? Will we need to be wearing Deet, long trousers, shoes and long sleeves at all times?"
"It depends on where you are and what time of the day. It is an issue mainly in certain parts of the island, especially in the western part, in the interior from Colombo. It is less of an issue on the southern coastal areas. You should be in long sleeves and long pants at dusk. Yes, deet will certainly help. We always have that with us when we go there and use it in the evenings. Make sure that your room is either has air conditioning or a fan going full blast when you sleep. Mosquito nets over the bed are also very effective.The dengue mosquitos do not travel far from where they are born. So if your hotel or the residence practice good mosquito control, the risk is low. No pools of dirty water, no rubbish dumps and so on.Edited: 2 years ago "
"And the dengue mosquitoes fly by day, so if you get bitten at night you won't get dengue."
"Dengue mosquitoes breed in clear water, even in wells. Bites usually during morning and evening hours. Best solution would be to apply repellent generously when you are out of your hotel room."
"Great advice above. We travelled in October, the start of the wet season and encountered no mosquitos during the day which is when the dengue mosquitoes are active. We did encounter mosquitos in some locations at night but no worse than anywhere. I also live in a climate similar to Sri Lanka and have encountered dengue outbreaks so I took no more precautions than I would at home. If there is a dengue outbreak it would be quite isolated and word will get around. Carry a Tropical strength repellant that contains DEET just as a precaution however we never had to use it. We wore shorts and t shirts pretty much all the time and not one bite, and I'm prone to being bitten.Take advice from locals or your driver, they will know if there is a risk or outbreak. I doubt you will have a problem. As I said Dengue mosquitoes don't travel far and if your location is free of stagnant water such as pooling in coconut palms, plant pots etc you should be ok. A 1km radius from an outbreak will give you plenty of protection if the property you are staying at has done the right thing.Edited: 2 years ago "
anyone who went to Sri Lanka since December? We have planned a holiday end of February and beginning od March and we have just read about Dengue epidemic and sounds scary. Did anyone go? Got infected?Any suggestion appreciared
The risk is there but if you take proper precautions the risk is minimal. There is no tropical country in the world that does not have dengue.
"We only encountered them at night, some areas there was quite a lot! Take some rid or aeroguard to protect yourself in the early evening when they are around. We were all bitten a few times but nothing serious! That includes our kids :) We visited for a few weeks in January & have just returned.Edited: 2 years ago "
"Just to repeat what has been noted before, that the dengue mosquito does not fly at night, so if you are bitten at night don't worry."
Is there risk for dengue mosquitos in May?
Year round. Sorry :-(< Erik>
"If you are sensible you will be fine. The Dengue risk is far higher for residents, with longer exposure and less likely to stick to constant DEET and covering up.Having had dengue before (as a resident) I was cautious on return visits (latest Jan/Feb 17). I covered up when appropriate (but not all the time, provided wearing repellant), and slathered on the mossie repellant at all times. Equally, I avoided waterside (lakes/pools) accomodation, chose a/c rooms where possible (sealed windows and doors) and in 3 weeks I think I had a grand total of 2 bites, and no dengue. Take the precautions and there is nothing to worry about.Edited: 1 year ago "

Haven't seen many tourists in Kandy in long trousers and long sleeves.Many is versions much shorter.Whatever they are doing against mosquitoes must be effective.
"Haven't seen many mosquitoes either in my two week travels. And it was already raining every day when we started. Inside the AC will be on all the time as the heat and humidity are unbearable, so mosquitoes will not be a problem. Outside, the repellent seems to do the trick.Negombo was the worst with lots of mosquitoes but I was assured they were not carrying dengue because the air is salty. :)"
