"https:/…6051898After yesterday’s videos of the, seemingly, same people that were crowding bars on St, Pat’s Day now crowding the beaches and the 606 and the Mayor’s angry “State of the City” report, this was inevitable. Why aren’t young people listening? Stay at Home."
Youth is wasted on the young.

Ummm those were mostly people over 40 in those pictures.
"Whatever age they are, they are stupid. Frankly, I don’t know what Lori was thinking. Keep it open, people will go there. Bars, parks, lakefronts."
"Got an emergency alert on my phone an hour ago with the notice.I can't fault the way Pritzker and Lightfoot have been going about it, really. They started (a couple weeks ago) asking people to pay attention to ""social distancing"" and had also cancelled St. Pat's activities. When they saw that their suggestions were being ignored by businesses and the general public (bars packed), the closings started. Then asked, still, for people to not congregate. People still did. So then shut the parks. They gave businesses / people a chance to ""do the right thing"" and took sterner action when that didn't happen.Sad they have to post cops along the trail to keep people out, because of course people will ignore the signs and just go around the barricades. Maybe actually getting ticketed will change the behavior. And no doubt plenty of folks still getting together to socialize, because ""we've all been taking precautions.""Makes you miss the days explaining how to get from O'Hare to downtown for the umpteenth time..."
"SF announced closing it's Muni System https://sf.curbed.com/2020/3/26/21195566/mun…BART and buses only. Chicago has been hand-in-hand with SF. Will it happen here? Yes, if people don't take this seriously."
Really frustrating as this is the best place to get exercise with gyms closed etc and there is no reason people shouldn't be able to bike and walk the lake front if they simply observed social distancing rules. It is particularly bad for bikers -- those still biking to work now have to bike on dangerous streets without bike lanes rather than the safe long lake shore bike path. No doubt someone will die because of this.
Yeah I don't really blame Pritzker or Lightfoot either but why have bars open and then are upset people are at the bars. And people were told they can go out and walk so they did. Of course they will walk on the lakefront. But yeah the football playing is crazy.
"The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. has climbed above China's total since the start of the outbreak, becoming the world’s highest.Stay Home"
The mayor is not against people going out and walking etc as long as they are distanced appropriately. Yesterday people were playing basketball and soccer. The 606 was very crowded and it is narrow. Wrecked it for everyone.B.
"Yes Janettravels, someone, or more, will die of Coronavirus."
And yes Carlo because some people were dicks and didn't behave responsibly other people commuting to essential jobs on bikes will probably die in traffic or be forced onto the buses and get COVID that way.
"from what i saw at gilson, up in wilmette, on friday, there were plenty of people out and about.... BUT, people were respecting social distancing---singles, pairs, maybe a family of 3 or 4 pretty much kept their distance from each other.... i did not observe big groups mingling together like what was happening in the chicago parks and lakefront.... the weird thing was vehicle traffic along sheridan rd was like a sunday morning, but there were tons of people out walking, jogging, walking the dog, biking.....again, keeping their distances from each other.... the only violation i observed was about a half dozen cyclists heading south on sheridan, but even then, they were a good distance from each other (who knows if they social distanced themselves during breaks or whatever)....but now i hear the beaches in the Northshore might close down as well.... the playgrounds, community centers, tennis courts etc have been closed for awhile.Edited: 2:10 am, March 27, 2020 "
"You have a new mayor and a new governor. On top of it, you got Rahm all over TV talking about how he would do things and you have the President releasing Blagovitch and Blago is writing editorials. Governor and Mayor can’t get any information from the feds except tweets saying nonsense. So they are panicking that Illinois is going to be the next big problem."
"Happi,Maybe I didn't fully understand your post, but I don't think Gov and Mayor are ""panicking"" at all. If you meant frustrated, then sure. Seems to me, they've been taking the advice of medical professionals and also been seeing what happened in China, Italy, etc and figured the lesser evil was to wreck economy vs wreck health care industry. I genuinely think they are making the best choices they can, although it cost my wife her job (she works in IT for a food service distributor). Sorry to say the density of Chicago means we will have a boatload of positive tests and more deaths...I've read it in multiple places, that if you could wave a magic wand and keep everyone 6 feet away from each other for 14 days, this whole thing just disappears (virus dies off in those infected and can't find new infections). No way to know if that's actually true of course, but really drives home the social distancing point.What a mess."
"I certainly do not think that the Governor nor the Mayor are panicking. They told us what to do, we didn't do it. They gave us the information and tried not to step on our freedom. The general population blew it themselves. Now our leaders have to slap us on the wrist and put restraints on us. It's our own fault. We need to stop treating Stay-At-home days as if they were vacation days."
I stand by my post. I’m sure they are panicking in the same way we all panic when the toilet water keeps rising and everything you try to do to stop the water flow doesn’t work.
"just remove the lid from the tank, and raise the float. then turn off the water at the shutoff valve at the wall. i don't like plunging, so usually i'll let the head pressure of the water in the bowl work its way thru the clog. if no joy, then i take a bucket of HOT water and pour it in the bowl.....this usually works after a few tries..... i'll plunge as a last resort, or as a final last resort, i'll break out the snake, which is pretty gross.... one time, i actually pulled the toilet off the floor to clear the clog (i thought a kid flushed a toy), but in hindsight, it wasn't necessary.my advice is ALWAYS do a courtesy flush first, THEN wipe. so, if the toilet plugs up, you're only dealing with paper and clear water, instead of raw sewage..... don't forget to flush after 2-3 wipes to reduce the chances of plugging the toilet!! if it takes 3 or 4 flushes, so be it!! and stay away from charmin, or other thick toilet paper..... that stuff is notorious for plugging toilets. the best is scott's 1000 sheet rolls, which COSTCO carries, when they have it in stock.... plus, it lasts much longer.hope this helps!!"
"""...stay away from charmin, or other thick toilet paper..."" ST, I can tell you are a man. We of the female persuasion prefer the soft TP :-)"
"ST, this deserves to be a sticky. Next time, make it travel related, “Fixing toilet in a Chicago hotel”. Lol. Maybe I’ll just take a pic of your handy directions."
"that's a good idea, but the questions editing page hasn't been working for me lately. when i hit the ""Add a question"" button, i get this message: ""Your request was invalid. Please send a valid HTTP request.""Dave, you got any advice?"
"ST re: courtesy flush...I am reminded of John Cage's penchant for a fresh bowl: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5bGfUKu-hM..couldn't find a clip of him saying that, but the above is a hoot anyway..."

"darn, i missed the drama............"
"Me too. S-T, since we’re both here now, how are the preserves up by you in terms of crowds, like by Harms Woods and the Skokie Lagoons, etc? I have been walking in my neighborhood everyday, but it’s a bit boring. They had to close the nature preserve near me, as well as Rosehill Cemetery, as people weren’t keeping social distance, and were treating Rosehill like a park, and I won’t go to Legion Park anymore either, so am thinking of an occasional outing."
"Warriorjan, I was going to start a post about where everyone was walking. I agree, the neighborhood can get boring after a while. We're still staying close to home, so we're not driving a great distance.We've noticed that the forest preserves are way more crowded than usual - my husband explained that there is nothing else for people to do now. I think hikers keep their distance though. Will County Forest Preserve parking lots had been closed, but are open now.Yesterday we walked at O'Hara Woods in Romeoville - a really spectacular sight with all the bluebells blooming as far as you can see. (Almost up there with seeing the eclipse!)"
"WarriorJan,Blair Kamin wrote a piece today about Graceland Cemetery. I've been, tho not recently. It's beautiful.I too was wondering about Harms Woods, including if toilet facilities would be open. The paths do get muddy after a rain there, so timing is important."
"Yeah I am still sticking close to home too, for now, so Romeoville is a bit far but maybe for a future trip. And Graceland is gorgeous, I have done various walking tours there."
"Illinitrav, that eclipse seems so long ago now! I still wear my eclipse tshirt from that shop in Hermann where we met by accident. I would love to get out somewhere like Moraine Hills, but am sticking closer to home for now. Yesterday my neighbor and I went on a socially distant neighborhood jaunt, and we actually walked around Peterson Park, which I had never done before, though it’s only about a mile away, as I don’t tend to go across the North Shore Channel for some reason. So still some little discoveries to make around here. I think Harms or the Lagoons will be next on my list, maybe Bunker Hill though not on a weekend with good weather."
"jan, April 8, 2024! I still wear my t shirt also. The plan was for my husband and I to have the matching eclipse t shirts, but he has yet to wear his. We were at Moraine Hills in the fall and the winter and saw sandhill cranes. A few years ago, there were a few that were on the trail right in front of us. I like what you said about little discoveries."
"Harms and the woods up to lake st had a fair # of people on the bike path during the recent warm days, but you can still maintain proper spacing, from what i've been able to tell. the cooler days, like today, there should be no problem.The parking lot off lake, just west of harms rd had a lot of cars on the nice days.the north branch was flooding after the big rain, so any dirt trails running near the river or in the bottomlands will be a nightmare.drove by the 'goons last week, but couldn't tell if the lots were open.....i think the one off willow rd was open. again, the 'goons were flooding, so i wouldn't bother with any of the dirt trails around them at this time.also last week, lighthouse beach and gilson park were open and people were walking along the lakefront. there were people at the gilson dog beach as well. the winnetka lakefront parks were closed and gated (tower rd, lloyd beach, elder lane etc)........next total eclipse is 2024!!!BUT, next nearby PARTIAL eclipse happens in a year!https:/…2021-june-10it'll occur right at sunrise---depending on weather forecasts, thinking of heading either up to copper harbor, mack city, alpena, marquette...or anywhere up nort with a clear view of the northeast horizon... it'll be visible here too, but it'll be minimal, but better than nothing!Edited: 1:10 pm, May 05, 2020 "
"TA outing to northern Wisconsin? Precursor to maybe Texas in 2024( I have already been thinking about where to go then)? I’m in. The Missouri outing taught me that one needs to situate oneself where you have the ability to head in different directions, depending on the weather. We had no clear idea where we would end up when we left St. Louis, but Hermann proved to be perfect. I wouldn’t head to either Harms or the Lagoons on a weekend. I have a friend in Evanston, she’s been walking through Northwestern frequently I think."
you can always go to carbondale!
"I looked into this awhile ago, not recently, and I think we were thinking about where you are most likely to have decent weather, with the longest time to see it."
"Almost four years from now, but I'm thinking about it too.ST, I didn't know about the eclipse next year. 725 miles to Nipigon, ON."
too far!
"S-T, seeing an eclipse is totally awesome -it is worth every minute you travel getting there. Some friends of my neighbors were so enamored after the eclipse here that they have become eclipse-chasers, and headed to South America for the last one."
