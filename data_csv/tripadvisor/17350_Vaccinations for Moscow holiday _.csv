Is it necessary to get any vaccinations for a week’s holiday in Moscow in early June? Other than a possible trip to the ‘Golden Ring’ towns we will not be travelling outside Moscow. Last year we holidayed in St Petersburg and did not get any vaccinations. Some guidebooks we have indicate that Tetanus/Polio/Diphtheria are recommended for Moscow. We are both in our 50s and have not had any ‘jabs’ for many years. Thanks for your advice.
"Hm... Never heard about unlucky foreigner who catched this terrible diseasies in a week holiday in Moscow. What differs Moscow from Paris, Shanghai or New York in terms of epidemic danger?Edited: 9 years ago "
Moscow does not differ from St.Pete in this regard.
We were told we didn't need any needles when we travelled to Russia. We ate food cooked by babushkas on railway stations and never got sick from that either.
Just don't eat yellow snow and you will be safe and sound :)
"Thanks for your good advice. Much as I had thought, but I suppose Guidebooks tend to work on the precautionary principle.Will also of course definitely avoid snow of every hue !"
