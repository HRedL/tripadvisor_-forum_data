Anguilla's borders are closed until at least May 31st.Anyone want to guess when she'll re-open?Mine is July 15th.Your's ?
October

November 1
End of August
Pepper! I hope you are right!!!! ❤️
End of August doesn’t make much senseSeptember is busiest hurricane month and lots of places closed
"Oct. / Nov. dates sound good but people need a paycheck.AXA has committed to 3 months of $800 EC payroll assistance for April, May & June for workers who have paid-in to Anguilla Social Security. There may be a new gov't team in place in 1-2 mo's after the upcoming election and the challenging party has run on a citizen-centered platform so they may find a way to extend payroll assistance, if they win. If payroll assistance is extended I can see the later (Fall) dates for re-opening. I guess I'm speaking out of both sides of my mouth."
"Today the border closure was officially extended to May 31.The shutdown is sure to be used for political gain. I predict November 15, and only then with draconian measures for ""protection""."
I hope I’m wrong but I think the rest of this season is lostI had a Malliouhana rez for June and they sent me a letter and cancelled it.They said they will re-open October 25th.
"Phoenix, I think you’re right. I think our May trip that was rescheduled to July is going to end up getting postponed until 2021. I don’t see this summer happening. Flying in and out of JFK is a huge contributor to my thought process."
"I will be surprised if they open this year. With the recent predictions of airline restrictions, no carryons, 4 hour checkin, testing before flying and after, it will be difficult for them to open. The island has to protect itself at all costs, they cannot afford to have an epidemic, they do not have the facilities or resources to stop the spread.Most people vacation for a week to 10 days, with the current proposed 14 day quarantine in a government facility, it will be difficult for the average person to vacation on Anguilla."
Phoenix: You are so right. I was actually thinking of the US and my particular area.I think maybe November will be the beginning for AXA. I hope so because it will likely be the safest place to be with the humidity and warm weather. (It's the getting there that's the tricky part!:-(
"It's not simply a matter of opening the borders. It's how to open them and make certain that no one coming in has the virus. One case and it's all over. So, the airlines are going to need to come up with a solution, and once here, people are going to likely need to be quarantined. Unless and until there is a vaccine, I suspect travel to Anguilla is not in the cards. I fear that there will be another dead season next year."
"Peter L: What if AXA insists upon a Doctor's form that guests coming into the island have been deemed covid free?Edited: 9:36 am, May 12, 2020 "
Apologies in advance if this question seems off topic but just wandering how long Anguilla can survive without the tourist industry?
"joebeach, the answer to your question is: It cannot survive.Peter L, the ""one case and its all over"" line of thinking is pure paranoia. The world will never be free of coronavirus or any other virus. Ever. That's life."
I’m a medical professional on the front lines.Widespread testing is ramping upA negative test or so called “immunity passport” will most like my be required for entry.
"Call me paranoid or whatever you like but I have to agree with Peter L. on this. I don't see it happening until there is a vaccine. On an island unprepared to deal with an epidemic, it seems the loss of life would be too high. Eventually there will be a protective ""herd immunity"" and we will all have been exposed, but seems like your chances are better with a vaccine and possible forthcoming treatments, along with a better understanding of the virus as a whole as it seems they are learning new things everyday.Just hope Anguilla can hold out long enough economically.Time will tell on this one."
"Phoenix: If what you say is so, then why would we have to be quarantined once we are actually on-island?"
"I believe that Anguillians are a very strong, resourceful and diligent people. They will come through this and they will NOT fail. It will be a hardship for them just like the hurricanes, but they showed their strength then and came back with flying colors and will do so again -- albeit with a difficult struggle.Let us be positive rather than the voice of doom for them and support them as they get right down to work fixing things as only they know how to do.Edited: 12:16 pm, May 12, 2020 "
"Hey Peps, I have an annoying tendency to drop nouns at the beginning of sentences.That last line should have read ""I"" just hope, meaning an expression more like hoping and wishing for the best, rather than ""Just hope"" which sounds more like an exhortation suggesting doom and gloom.Edited: 12:43 pm, May 12, 2020 "
Daff: I never took it any other way. I know ya gal!
PepperQuarantine on arrivals is a “current concept” that countries are exploringAn antibody test would document status of patient and would hopefully obviate quarantine
Gotcha!Thanks
"<< ""An antibody test would document status of patient and would hopefully obviate quarantine"" >>Actually, it won't document anything meaningful relative to need for quarantine.An antibody test will only confirm whether the subject's immune system has ever mounted an immune response to COVID-19. An antibody test will NOT document anything about when the patient was exposed to the virus or -- more importantly -- whether the subject is currently infected and contagious.If you were exposed, say four days ago, you might show antibodies. Or you might not. But either way you could be currently infected, asymptomatic, and highly contagious.If you were exposed, say a day or two ago, you might NOT show antibodies, Or you might. But either way you could be currently infected, asymptomatic, and highly contagious.If you were exposed two months ago, you would almost certainly show antibodies. Or you might not. But even if you do have antibodies no one really knows yet whether you can contract again... So either way you could be currently infected, asymptomatic, and highly contagious.Accordingly, from a travel/quarantine standpoint, results of an antibody test at this time -- whether positive or negative -- doesn't really mean anything."
RJPAre you a medical professional ?I respectfully disagree with a significant portion of your last post.As this is a travel forum I’m happy to discuss via private messaging
"PhoenixFF, please, enlighten us on your opinion. It would be instructive for all potential travelers.Edited: 3:44 pm, May 12, 2020 "
"Hi Kap,I fully agree that there are lots of health issues floating around at there, but none of them has risen to the level of being a pandemic. I fear that unless and until there's either a reliable vaccine or a herd immunity that travel to anywhere is going to be severely restricted. I think I'm being realistic rather than suffering from paranoia. It's going to be an extremely difficult decision for Anguilla, but I believe caution will prevail."
"<< “ As this is a travel forum I’m happy to discuss via private messaging‘ >>The relative value of antibody testing for screening of travelers seems travel-related to me.Admittedly, it’s been decades since I took an immunology course, and I gave up my “scientist” union card a long, long time ago. So, while some of the details may be fuzzy (eg time to detection of SARS-Cov-2 specific IgM/IgG, etc) my rudimentary understanding of serologic antibody testing — as it exists today — is that it’s not currently the travel panacea that many folks are hoping for.Edited: 4:23 pm, May 12, 2020 "
"Firstly I think we need to see how the repatriation of Anguilla's own goes. Will the nation pay for them to utilizea private charter flight? Travel to countries that have the virus and the means to deal with it will be very different than virus free nations. With out direct flights there is no guarantee passengers haven't been exposed transitting thru the many stopovers that are mostly required to reach there. So much is unknown ie, having adequate immunity (titer) so IMHO Anguilla is a no go till the vaccine. Perhaps the uber heavy hitters who can travel privately will be able to visit upon getting tested pre-travel and flying direct only. The only answer is time and likely lots of it."

Well said Ellen!
That brilliant quote was from the esteemed RJP-NJ. I totally agree with all his statements.
"Ah, not i see that thanks. Well said RJP-NJ!"
Possibly November 3rd might change the complexion of our country (either for better or for worse)
Cryptic. Please elaborate as to the effect on the re-opening of Anguilla.
I have given up hope until next Spring. Pray I can do it then.
"Misty:Sadly, I think you are right."
"Most of us understand the need for the continued travel prohibition and that it may need to stay in place until a vaccine is developed (I don't see how Anguilla or any country could document or rely upon the necessary level of ""herd immunity"" as a substitute for a vaccine) or the virus disappears on its own (like the 1919 Spanish flu or the SARS virus). Since we don't know when, or even if, a vaccine can be developed, or when the virus will expire, there's no timetable that can be given for when Anguilla (or any country) can safely welcome international visitors. On the other hand, we do know that many companies are hard at work trying to develop a vaccine (and therapeutic medicines that can alleviate the worst effects of the virus). And we also know that past pandemics did come to an end after seeming to be unstoppable. So there's good reason to believe that some day (hopefully in the not too distant future) the restrictions will be lifted and life will return to something approaching what it was like before the pandemic."
"Let's assume there is never an effective vaccine. What does an island do that depends on tourism for their economy? I am hopeful that we can get back -- although this summer is looking depressingly unlikely, we are keeping our reservations until the end! -- even if it's never ""the same"" as last year. Eating Jacala's lobster club from a takeout box on our own rented beach chairs with our own icy bottle of rose tucked in our cooler? Still heaven."
"RMG:Are you not worried about getting there with all the congestion in airports, etc.?I am hoping for December, but realistically I doubt it will happen -- safely."
Multiple vaccines are already in development.Unfortunately there are no perfect vaccines.The viruses are smart and tney constantly mutateThe yearly Influenza and pneumonia vaccines are limited in their effectivenessFuture travel can document vaccination or a positive antibody test Neither of which infers complete immunity from re-infection
"We just rescheduled our June trip to March 2021. We were looking forward to introducing our 12 yr old daughter to the beautiful island and people of Anguilla. So sad. We’ve only been to Anguilla in June where we have most restaurants/beaches ourselves. We always make reservations just so restaurants know to expect us, but how much more crowded is March over June?"
"hcompton,Mar. '21 should be busy as people will come after not being able to visit most of 2020.... as long as the traveler, the island, and the airlines get to a safe(r) place with this virus."
"I wonder whether at some point AXA may conclude that it has to take some level of health risk, in order to save the economy from destruction. It does not seem to me that the offshore banking sector, or any other island industry, can sustain the island's economy in the long or even medium term. BUT I am not that knowledgeable about all that, and in any event it is a decision for local people and their government to make -- balancing the disease risk against the risk of economic destruction. Very tough decisions, I imagine."
"Many Anguillians would like to grow their natural resource, fishing, so their economy becomes less dependent on tourism. Anguilla has seen what Mother Nature can do to tourism with Hurricane Irma 2017 & coronavirus 2020. 70-80% of the AXA economy dependent on tourism may be too much today. Anguilla thinks the demand for fish within the Caribbean islands mkt. could support their quality supply of snapper, mahi mahi and lobster/crayfish."
My wild guess would be that offshore banking/finance has better prospects than fishing. But competing with BVI and Cayman isn’t easy.
"Anguilla has a very limited health and hospital infrastructure compared to the countries that make up its tourist base. If the virus were to break out in Anguilla, the hospital system would be quickly overwhelmed. That's the fear driving the government (and the vast majority of Caribbean countries) to take the stringent steps its taken. The government is certainly and painfully aware of the economic consequences of its decision, especially coming just two years after Hurricane Irma. My guess, and it's just a guess, is that the Caribbean will look to open up again in time for the 2020-21 season in the hope that any second wave of the virus will be much milder than this year and that there will be therapeutic medications available to limit the strain on the countries' health systems. In that event, they'd be taking on some level of health risk in the absence of an effective vaccine being developed but the risk then would be more limited and more manageable than it is today with the current state of the pandemic.Edited: 7:59 am, May 17, 2020 "
"I thought this was an interesting article:""One new expense you need to consider before you travel again""https:/…"
"Check the Governor's Facebook page Mon. or Tue. May 25th & 26th for update re: opening up Anguilla.KLASS FM 92.9 radio should be on top of it, too."
"I have been monitoring this closely as we should be there now. We postponed until early July. We are scheduled to arrive July 5th. We wanted to go earlier but our hotel had no availability. We were thinking of going a few days earlier and staying at Four Seasons as they had availability, I check daily. They now are not booking rooms until October 25. I know it is bad to assume but I am thinking that is when the island will be open for visitors.. I guess we have to wait until next week.Edited: 6:56 pm, May 22, 2020 "
"This is great news, hopefully, they will learn the procedures quickly and testing will allow people to enter.COVID-19 Testing Equipment has Arrived in Anguilla22 May – With the arrival of equipment from the UK and the completion of on-line training the Health Authority can now accurately and quickly test for the COVID-19.Health Authority CEO Maeza Demis-Adams praised the hard working laboratory staff and went on to say:“Testing is a vital component of the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The acquisition of both the GenXpert and the Quanstudio PCR machines, testing kits, supplies and training will significantly enhance our ability to manage our local situation. The significance of our ability conduct testing on island is remarkable. This milestone was made possible by the UK Government (FCO, Local Governor’s Office and Public Health England) who have all been phenomenal in the support given to Health Authority of Anguilla during this health crisis.”"
I don't believe ppl in the U.S. realize that like the UK just implemented the U.S. will impose a 14 day mandatory quarantine when you arrive back in the USA from your vacation on Anguilla once air travel is reinstated . Who has 14 days post vacation to stay quarantined in their house after arriving back
"UK has not implemented anything yet...but will do so from 8th June, with some exceptions, US citizens will not be one of them"
"@mahdtii -- with many of us, yours truly included, working from home for the foreseeable future (likely months for us), ""having to stay home"" for 14 days would be no different than the current situation. We'd gladly do it!"
"FWIW- rec’d correspondence from Zemi re: our June 26-July 5 trip and I will share it. Granted no official word yet on extending the closure, but perhaps this is what they are preparing for with the hopes of reopening for high season? The email stated:Due to the continued coronavirus situation, St. Marteen and Anguilla travel ban will continue for the month of June and perhaps for July and August as well. We are therefore, contacting you to propose to reschedule your visit for any date after October 23rd 2020."
"Sueq, exactly in line with when Four Seasons will now be accepting bookings."
"We're supposed to be there for honeymoon in the last part of July/early August...... still hoping....Is there one official page for the dates? I'm just following along on the beatcovid AI site and FB page - as well as looking at SXM airport.Another thing though - even if stuff opens - these different countries could have different rules. Say... you land in SXM and have to quarantine for ""X"" amount of days before going to Anguilla or something..."
"rmg , you're in a dream world. in 2.5 months kids will be physically going back to school in many states and Anguilla borders are still not open. Once they do open, July at the earliest, that gives families 1.5 months to arrange a holiday before the kids are back in school and a 14 day post vacation home quarantine wait would be difficult for many. Being a family member would probably make this a little more understandable for you I'm sure.Edited: 1:22 pm, May 23, 2020 "
"mahdtii, I am not sure where the personal attack is coming from re: ""dream world"" and accusing me of not having family members?? You have been extremely argumentative with posters here and on Facebook before (Manoahgate) so I'm stopping after this. 1. Despite insisting you have actual evidence that the US will adopt the UK policy, you miraculously refuse to link to it when asked and just state you have it. Ok then.2. Let's assume the 14 day isolation policy happens. Many visitors to Anguilla aren't caring for children at home and will be working remotely for months to come if not permanently (ex Twitter). Or even if not, their workplaces will accept ""work from home upon return"" given the vacationing employees have already proven the ability to do so productively during this time. So I can certainly see an active return to tourism even if self-quarantine is required when returning home.Sorry if that affects people with kids at home more than those without (or people who can't work from home) but we have to start somewhere..."

or necessarily after their trip
This summer season is lost.Major hotels are going to open in late October again.
"PhoenixFF,You're probably right, I'm just not sure summer is gone. Extended quarantine could be t-h-e killer & big resorts may not re-open until Oct./Nov.But,1. Smaller hotels, villas, restaurants are nimble & may re-open. 2. People need paychecks.3. Historically, 80% chance bad weather stays away.4. Governor says ""We can't sit behind closed borders forever.""5. Visitors want to return."
"No matter how nimble smaller hotels may be, they're not going to reopen until international travel is allowed again to Anguilla. If Anguilla does begin allowing visitors to come, it's almost certainly going to insist on the same rules and conditions for them that apply to its own citizens returning to the island.We all understand the crushing economic reality from this prolonged shutdown. But we need to appreciate that Anguilla has a very limited hospital infrastructure compared to the United States, Canada, the UK and most of the countries that make up its tourist base. It wouldn't take a lot of cases to overwhelm its healthcare system. That, more than any other factor, is why the government is proceeding so cautiously about reopening Anguilla to tourism. I don't see Anguilla moving beyond these strict restrictions until there's greater certainty that its hospital system can deal with any spread of the virus. That may come if/when vaccines and other medical treatments are developed to deal with the virus. It could also come if/when a robust testing regimen is established to ensure that visitors are virus-free. Probably some combination of the two. It's hard to see that happening in the next few months but by this fall it may be a different story, subject of course to whether there's a second wave of the virus."
Well.... I bought the new GoPro and snorkel gear ..... figured it'd be best to have anyways.... at least now we will have it for the trip.Wedding is in the air due to rules... trip in the air..... 2020....Anyone considering a 2nd wave in the fall after things open up?
"The Anguilla Governor FB page has a post 5-28-20 with rules for coming back onto Anguilla. The guidelines include several steps, a 14 day quarantine period for everyone (many times in a gov. quarantine center) and the prioritization of people coming back has visitors toward the bottom of the list."
"The governor's office just announced procedures for repatriation of Anguilla residents. Mandatory 14-day quarantine, priority given to those coming from countries with no active cases, among other fairly draconian measures. Full paranoia mode, IMO. I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for Anguilla to open up to tourists any time soon. It could be a very, very long time."
"Yes, I do not see tourists returning anytime soon. They have to protect their little island. Right now, they are looking at belongers, students, residents, all with a 14 day Q upon arrival, who knows when tourists will be allowed back in.I commend them for their diligence in protecting their population."
I’m a little behind on my AXA knowledge but have there been many/any cases on the island?
"chelloveks - no. I believe there were 3 total confirmed cases. Anguilla did an awesome job of isolating the spread and there have been no further cases for 45+ days -- hence the relaxation of rules for people who are there already but also the extreme concern with new arrivals.Based on the caution shown with allowing even citizens/residents back on island I'm not willing to make any bets at this point re: when tourists will be allowed back, as I can't imagine any of us want to spend vacation time in government quarantine on arrival (and even if that is not required, the 14 day quarantine required for returning citizens/residents is longer than most people's trips)."

"Wow I’m happy to hear they did such a good job with the controls. As someone who grew up a block away from Elmhurst Hospital and have had 10 people I know get the virus, I kinda know how serious this has been. All of them recovered thank goodness. My current house is 7 miles from Times Square as the crow flies but I can tell you, THIS crow will be avoiding my beautiful city and all it’s alluring restaurants, shows, and cultural entertainment for a long time to come.I’ll just have to go to Carmine’s in Atlantic City!"
Port closure order has been extended to June 30.
Good afternoon. Where did you find this information re the borders staying shut till the end of June?Thank you.
Press release on Radio Anguilla FB page.
"KAP, thanks for heads up. I believe these are the changes eff. June 1st, 2020:1. Anguillians may now return home. (new)2. Anguillians & non-Anguillians may leave island. (new)3. Fishing allowed 7 days a week on north side of island. (new)4. Cargo may come onto the island. (continuation)5. Emergency transportation is allowed on & off the island. (continuation)6. Incoming borders still closed If not a citizen coming home."
The revised regulations are on the BeatCovid19.ai site:https:/…
It appears that most resorts are looking at the last week of October to re-open
Does that mean sans quarantines of any sort US or AXA?
"Guess: virus update will be after June 29th elections when govt. team for next 5 yrs is chosen. Now:Belongers, permanent residents, medical students & work permit holders have priority for entry.Tourists come next which may require 14 day quarantine like everyone else. Seems that'll kill tourism but is there a better answer short of a vaccine?"
We have rebooked for May 2021. I pray by then this is all far behind us.
"NYBeach - same here. I think we had roughly the same original dates (late May), backup dates (around the 4th of July), and now officially-postponed dates (late May 2021 - our first Anguilla Day on island, knock wood). Hope to see you there :)"
"Hi RMG, yes you are correct! We are now going mid May 2021 and will miss Anguilla Day."
RMG and NYBeach hope to see you both May 2021! The countdown is on!
