"I have flights booked to Dubai early May. What's the current situation in Dubai, in terms of- do they let tourists visit the country- is there a mandatory quarantine- is it also allowed for tourists to leave their hotels without permission between 6am amd 10pm, use public transport, etc?Thank you."
"No inbound flights and foreigners allowed to enter the country. They just say it will start back early July in the best case scenario, possibly September but anyway gradually."
"I have booking for 2nd july, fingers cross its all opened by then"
Don’t expect matters to ease before July https://m.khaleejtimes.com/coronavirus-pande…
"Dubai is aiming to be 'open' again on 01 July, which is perhaps why the two main local airlines have shifted/delayed until then.Of course, it's not just the flights but there are other issues (visas, movement restrictions/regulations as well as degrees of 'open' in terms of restaurants, shops etc..So there are two factors really - if you can get in, and how diminished your experience maybe once you get there. It would be prudent to check to see what options you may have for a contingency e.g. rebook, refund etc. because it's unlikely to be the experience you expected when booking.For instance, open brunches/buffets are very unlikely to be available."
