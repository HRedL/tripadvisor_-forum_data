"Has anyone gotten approval on a Saturday or Sunday that HAD to upload a negative covid test? According to what I was told, those travel authorizations that have to be reviewed by a person as opposed to being approved by a computer. I'm curious because 5 days prior to arrival for us is a Saturday and if no one even reviews the weekend applications until Monday, that creates quite a backlog and it makes me worried that we won't hear back in time."
"At Visit Jamaica, you can email your question....this is what I would do. I have read that many are getting very quick answers. I would trust that answer vs an answer here on TA.Happy Travels"
"thank you, I had thought of doing that too but I'm still waiting for a reply to a question that I emailed them this past Sunday :("
Got approved on a Sunday after requested on Saturday!
@robint834 thank you so much for that info!!!... did you have to upload a covid test also?
We applied on Monday and still haven’t heard anything. We are supposed to leave on Friday.
"@sonomom oh jesus!!... nothing like stressing your butt off right before you are due to leave... please keep us updated, and sending positive vibes your way!"
"whether you need a test result depends on where you are fromUS citizens yes, Canada and UK no (those seem to be main visitors)the date for this coming into force was today but whether that uses today as arrival date or application date I don't knowEdited: 7:00 am, August 20, 2020 "
"This says it's based on arrival date, the 10 day thing should make it a lot easier for youAll residents of the United States of America (USA), Brazil, Dominican Republic or Mexico who are 12 years of age or over, with travel dates of August 20, 2020 or later will be required to obtain a COVID-19 RT-PCR test. The test should be conducted within 10 days of the intended travel date at a medical laboratory that is accredited by the relevant national health authorities. For the United States of America, the medical laboratory should be accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP).Edited: 7:04 am, August 20, 2020 "
@sonomom I am in the same situation. Leaving tomorrow applied on Monday. Have you heard anything yet? I don’t know whether to reschedule at this point but then we would still have to go through the process all over again.
"That's not good if it's taking so long, hope you get sorted"
"Danni G , did you try calling the number on the verification page they list if you need help? 888-786-2703)"
"Winnie: that number is for residents only.. they might be able to help, but don’t hold your breath."
"Still nothing. We called yesterday after it had been more than 48 hours. After 2 hours on hold, they said they expedited our request."
I am so stressed. Could you please tell me who you called.
We called 888-786-2703 Good luck!
"Sonomom, did you get the authorization after they said they expedited it? How long after ? Everyone is going to have to be put in anxiety medicine to go on vacation! We booked back in May before things got screwy , wish we didn’t."
"here's a question for those flying with a significant other but not technically a family member, how did your answer that question? I benefit it's something like number of family members traveling with you, or are you traveling with family? did you answer yes or no?"
"@winnie w oh yes, I booked in May as well, and I had a mini panic attack on my way to work today!!"
We are still waiting on our approval. Almost 72 hours from when we applied.
"Family means those who are related to you by marriage or blood. If the person you’re traveling with is not related by blood or marriage, they are not family"
@sonomom We just got our approval. Fingers crossed for you.
We got our test results Tuesday - I uploaded and completed the form on Tuesday. No approval yet - I'll try calling this phone number---we fly out on Saturday at 6am !Anyone not get their approval in time for flight?
I applied on Sunday night and still no approval! I even requested to expedite my application using the site's support request form yesterday.  I'm leaving tomorrow morning. I'll probably have to cancel my trip.
"Yeah if you don't have the approval, you can't even board the plane."
"Jc jacko, this is a shot in the dark, but I wonder if the resort you are staying at would have any pull or connection to get them to move it along, I'm sure they wouldn't want a last minute cancellation."
We still haven’t heard anything. Getting close to cancelling.
I canceled my trip. I'm tired of constantly checking! Wish you all best of luck for those who are waiting.
Have you heard anything yet? We are suppose to leave on Saturday.
We haven’t heard anything yet
"Sonomom, when do you leave?"
Call this number to get approved! She approved us right away! 1(876)542-6006
"Thank you so much! You saved our trip. I spent the whole day on the phone. And then your post, Approved immediately!!!"
I called 876 542 6006 and was approved right away. My flight leaves Saturday morning. Keep calling someone will help.
Yes life saver. I called that number and approved right away. Thanks so much.
We were ready to cancel until we saw this post. Thank you so much!!!!!!!!
OMG!! You are an angel/blessing! This saved my wedding !!! Thank you soooo much!!!!!
Did those who got through to that number reach someone right away? It just keeps ringing.
@QTMama I got through right away but others have had to call numerous times. Keep trying although I don't know what time they close and start again in the morning. Good luck!
Great breakthrough! Good work TA people!
Just called and they said that someone could help me tmrw at 8:00AM. Going to try then (fingers crossed!)
Yes worked perfect. Thanks a lot
Did you call this morning already? I’m trying to get a hold of them now but no luck so far
"Has anyone had success calling this morning? Thank you so much for the help. Take care!Edited: 9:07 am, August 21, 2020 "
"There is an hour time difference, it's 8 am there now, someone said they come in a eight ."
Thank you everyone! My wife and I received approval through that number. A special thank you to the person that shared the number. Good luck everyone!
Got through on 1-876-542-6006 and was approved right on the phone! Keep calling - my husband and I called dozens of times for the last two hours. Be persistent and you will get through!
"Having this number that a human actually answers is awesome! But may I make a suggestion?Please don't call it unless your situation is REALLY getting down to the wire (maybe if you haven't heard 24 hours before you fly?). I know how easily systems get overloaded in Jamaica (and everywhere, California EDD STILL doesn't answer their phones!) so we'll want to leave this line as open as possible for folks that are really stuck. So, hard as it might be (I'm so Type A I wouldn't have a hair left on my head) please wait out the approval through regular channels before calling."
I went to the Facebook page for the Jamaican Ministry of Health and it appears they shut down their Kingston office due to an employee testing positive for COVID. It states another facility is open. I don’t know if this will effect authorization rates. I am supposed to fly in less than 48 hours. Haven’t been able to reach anyone by phone all morning.
Any updates? I have been calling all morning and can't through :-( We are supposed to travel on Sunday and it would be ideal to have it in hand today...Do they even work on weekends? This has been beyond stressful! :-(
I uploaded my negative test result yesterday morning and scheduled to fly out on Tuesday morning! If they're so backlogged I wonder why they make you wait until 5 days prior to travel to submit the form. I'm hoping I don't have to cancel!!
Did you end up getting approved my flight is set to leave in 10 hours and we have heard nothing back
Did you try calling the number?1(867)542-6006
I sent my application on Wednesday but was suppose to fly out today ( Saturday) and had to change my flight.. Is there a number to call? It’s been pending for days..
"Keisha, looks like multiple posters have gotten through on 876 542 6006 and we’re helped immediately. Not sure about weekend hours."
Does anyone know the weekend hours? I’ve been calling all morning and the phone line is busy. I rebooked my flight for tomorrow.
Try changing the last digit of the phone number to 7
Thank you!! I’ve been trying tht also.. has anyone called today and got them ?
"Have you gotten through to anyone? I submitted mine on the 19th, still says pending. I’m supposed to fly out tomorrow. Not sure if I should cancel or rebook for Monday"
I called them 289 times on 2 different cell phones and got through. They approve it over the phone and you will immediately get the confirmation email. There is no other way around it but to keep redialing until they pick up. My flight is tomorrow at 6am.
So you got an answer on Saturday? We fy at 9:30AM tomorrow and still in pending. Trying the number but getting called party unavailable.
Anything?
I called 289 times on 2 separate cell phones and was able to get a representative to help. She approved me instantly over the phone and confirmation emails were sent. If you don't call then you will not be approved. Don't give up and just keeping redialing. My flight is tomorrow morning at 6am.
I have called both numbers hundreds of times and keep getting that the called party is temporarily unavailable. Anyone else have any luck?
"I have verizon and this number says call cant be completed, has anyone had this issue?"
Same it says call cannot be completed as the called customer isn't available at this time
We are freaking out over here in Cumming. We are supposed to fly out tomorrow as well. Husband keeps getting a Jamaican when he calls: 888-786-2703.Is this the number ya'll are calling??
Verizon call not connecting recording..there are 6 of us. Some have taken off work..this is crazy
"OK, we just got our authorizations. we called BACK TO BACK! KEEP CALLING! One thing I did is called on whats app. I know that alt of other countries use this, don't know if this will make a difference . They are working this saturday!"
I just landed in Jamaica. At the airport the party in line in front of of was panicked because ther were not allowed to check in. I gave them that number and they received authorization in time to make our flight. The number workd just keep trying.
Which number?? We are close to canceling. My daughter is devastated
what number is everyone calling? I am listening to Jamaican commercial from ministry of health
"You would think the ministry of health would streamline travel authorizations for people who booked holidays in advance but got screwed by the short notice change to a mandatory PCR test. Turned in my results 2 days ago, but travel authorization never responded. No working phone number (yes I attempted the one provided here all day for 2 days), no e-mail.My girlfriend and I cancelled. Won’t be re-booking either. Jamaica can get their 35% GDP tourism from someone else (not including tips). It’s been a pain to get a response from the hotels, airport transportation companies, Jamaican gov’t. Lazy. Cya!"
We called the 876 number 176 times and finally got someone on the phone. He said he would push it through but I have no idea when. He said an hour or two.
"Someone in my fb group mentioned if you call this number you will get an authorization very quickly. 1-876-542-5998... it may be hard to get through, but keep calling. There is another number back in this thread to try as well! Good luck!"
WE GOT THROUGH!!!DON'T GIVE UPNow we wait... he said hour or hour in a half...he was very nice and apologized. He said they were very very busy.
Please keep us posted we are also traveling from Cumming tomorrow. Headed to Sandals Negril. Would like to know if yours gets done.
Did you ever get your approval?
Not yet. He said an hour or two.
What number are you calling. I haven’t been able to get one at all!!
Please tell me that number you called. I haven’t been approved and it’s pending for 3 days now and called the Jamaica residents number and they couldn’t help me.
Can you tell me what number you called I have a flight tomorrow my son got approved already I’m waiting for mine
That’s the number I called and they told me they couldn’t help me
Please let me know the number when you can
What number did you call to get help????
"I am truly sorry for all is you having some delays on your travel authorizations. Just remember, id you don’t have that authorization when you get to the airport, you’re not flying anywhere. My nephew flew in a few days ago and he said they’re were a couple of travelers who didn’t have theirs and weren’t allowed to board. Good luck to those of you waiting"
Can I suggest that you wait until you are 24 hours out unit you use the number? Most of us are traveling tomorrow morning.
We called 1-876-542-6006
Thank you
"876-542-6006It took 51 calls for them to finally answer!Sometimes it would ring, sometimes go straight to Verizon message.Just keep calling!!Please remember there are folks trying to get through for tomorrow's flights..."
I leave Monday evening from the U.S. and submitted my travel authorization on Thursday. I was approved today via email. I too was very worried that I would not be approved in time due to the weekend. I called the number listed earlier many times this morning and finally got through. I even sent a message on the visit Jamaica website and they said they would expedite my authorization. Be persistent and stay positive!
Well the call did help. We got a request for more info. They are saying we do not have the correct test type because the lab didn't put PCR on the form. It just says SARS COV2 nasal swab.
I just got through and they told me I should receive something shortly and hung up on me. Did they tell you that you were approved over the phone?
Where did you get your test done and which lab processed it?
Andor Labs. In North Carolina
How do you know it is still pending? I am waiting as well. Supposed to leave tomorrow and haven’t heard anything. Is there somewhere you can check to see that it is pending?
they didn't tell me I was approved but they asked for my name and passport number. Then they told me that I would be getting the travel authorization sent to my email. I waited about 1-2 hours after the phone call until the authorization arrived in my email.
GUYS PLEASE KEEP CALLING. Don’t give up. We finally got approved!! Rebooking flights now. 1876542600518765426007
"Whoever shared the 876-542-6007 number, thank you! We just got approved in time for our flight in the morning. All they needed were the passport numbers. Please don't give up folks! Call without ceasing."
We had to cancel until the 7th..so stressful
I called 876-542-6007 and got through pretty quickly. They also have lines ending in *6005 and *6007 too. The agents on the local numbers seem to be more available. I submitted my application this morning and she was able to approve it an hour ago.
"We rescheduled. It was to stressful. We were dealing with flights, villa, travel insurance, and 2 people did not have the right Covid test( PCR)We have changed everything to the 7th.The 2 hurricanes will be gone as well.."
OMG!!Same here!! We went to Windermere medical!!!We rescheduled for 7th-14...to much stress ugh
These phone numbers to call for expediting/instant approval- would these likely result in international call charges for US callers? Just trying to weigh how long before calling to avoid unnecessary charges if applicable.
"@katelyn, buy an international phone card. in bigger cities with caribbean/african/latin american/indian populations they sell them in bodegas/corner stores/package stores.like this: https:/…"
"No, the number everyone is calling is 1 (876) 542-6006. It is the Ministry of health and wellness number. A pattern that I have noticed is that they are not answering in the morning. If you look everyone that has called they say they got an approval it is in the afternoon or later evening. Which that is exactly what happened to us we called all morning and around 1:30ish (CST) we were able to get through much easier. Hope this helps someone, this forum helped us so I am trying to put as much information in here as possible."
First and foremost I came on here earlier trying to search for answers and a number to call to get my travel authorization approved. The number 1 (876) 542-6006 does work. I download an app called boss revolution loading 10 dollars on to the app and was able to make the international call. I called many times it kept ringing and hanging up. I kept calling and finally I got a hold of someone. I gave my first and last name and passport number. Then received a email approving me after. It works don’t give up
I called the number and i was able to talk to someone. He said the application is approved within 48 hours from the submission time and he can't help me to approve it. I have a flight later at 6am so I guess I won't be able to fly :(
I called this number 876-542-5998. It’s very hard to get through. Phone will ring and then stop. Just keep calling. Once answered a young man took my name and passport number. I was approved in 10 min.
We also finally got our travel approved but too late as we made the decision to change our plans. Jamaica is missing a lot of revenue with this terrible process. It's insane that you must dial a number hundreds of times in order to get this approval and that there is no effective way to use their approval system. So we are going elsewhere for this trip and we are happy we got insurance on this one. We love Jamaica and will be back but likely after the Covid stuff has passed and things get back to normal.The Jamaican government is missing a great opportunity to make money. They should look to ClubMobay as an example. I would have paid almost any amount to have this process expedited.
Did you call this morning or was this yesterday? Does anyone know if they will have the phones staffed on a Sunday?
This is what I need to know as well. Are they open 7 days a week because my flight is tomorrow morning... I guess I will keep trying to call and pray that I get through
"Alayna, please let us know if you get through and which number worked (hoping it does!!)"
"Hello all, my wife and I are flying to Jamaica tomorrow morning, and she got the approval letter at 2:20am. I have not gotten mine yet. I have been calling the phone numbers listed here, but it won’t even ring. Does anyone know another phone number I could call? Or any idea of the outcome of this?Thank you,-FEdited: 11:33 am, August 23, 2020 "
Call these two numbers: 1-876-542-5998 and 1-876-542-6007. I got through and they say they will expedite my app. Fingers crossed as my flight is also tomorrow am. Hope this helps
I got through however they are saying they are expediting my app. Called 1-876-542-6007 & 1-876-542-5998
They're picking up on the first ring on the 6007 number!! The rep said she will send the approval email shortly. Jamaica need to change the requirements asap. This has been such a hassle!!
we called this number this morning and she answered. Just got approved! 8765425998
"Thank you so much, I was able to get through on 1-876-542-6007, and they said I should expect the approval soon. I'll keep you all posted, thanks again, this was very helpful."
I just spoke to someone at Sandals and he made it seem like there was a big glitch in the system. We are supposed to leave next Sunday. I am still nervous about it so I am curious to hear from people the next few days on if the process is a little bit more seamless.
"Did it seem like the glitch was fixed ? Submitted last night we have a Thursday departure plan to start calling tomorrow afternoon, if we need to cancel need to do it by Tuesday night. Will keep the group posted."
"Hello all, I called this number again: 1-876-542-5998, and this time after speaking to a nice gentleman, I got the approval 10 minutes after the call. Keep calling until you get it, call every hour or half hour.Thank you all for your help."
"Pink: what requirement? A travel authorization and negative test result? Why? You’re ridiculous. We are in the middle of a global pandemic that no leader, in this world, has ever faced before. Jamaica is doing a great job handling this crisis.. don’t like the requirements, don’t travel. If you must travel here at least have some sense and wear a mask, keep your hands clean and stay away of locals as much as possible"

"lol, @Pink Chocolate- SUCHHHHHH a hassle.sorry your vacation plans have been very, very, very marginally impacted by a global pandemic and one small country's attempt to manage it without completely capsizing itself."
"Our travel authorization was denied after calling. Our only option in the time frame allotted was the PCR test offered by Walgreens. I had a bad feeling it did not clearly state it was a PCR test but it was what out travel rep from Couples recommended. I also called PWN Health who confirmed that the test they were providing in conjunction with Walgreens was a PCR Test. I guess I just want to let everyone know it's not a slam dunk, I assume everyone who made it through had supporting documentation that clearly indicated a PCR Test.We submitted our application on Thursday - we were to travel on Tuesday. Thank you for providing the phone numbers - I guess knowing we aren't going is better than still waiting."
We had ours from Walgreens as well. With the info provided at the test site they included a sheet that specified RT-PCR. We submitted this along with the labcorp copy of the test results not just the emailed version from PWN. I submitted ours yesterday for Thursday travel... now I’m worried . I did send an inquiry late last week and they said Walgreens and labcorp would be good ....
"@chitownMS - I also took a Walgreens covid test today and got my results within 40 minutes. Unfortunately, the lab results do not say PCR on them so I've been looking for another lab. I don't travel until Sept 2 so I have a little bit of leadway. Sorry to hear you have to cancel. :-("
"@chitownMS if you don't mind me asking, what did it state on your results, as far as the type of test?"
"Our PCR test had to be sent away to a lab, it was about 48 hrs from test to results. Perhaps the 40 minute rapid version isn’t accepted? Some test sights offer both, perhaps you just need to specify ?"
"Any rapid test will not count, they need to be sent to a accredited lab. Results on site will not count. CVS does the PCR COVID test, depending on your state they take 2-7 days."
"anyone that's still waiting and leaving tomorrow, I just listened to the MOH press conference and they said they have a little more than 200 more people to review and approve and they will all be completed tonight"
"Sorry to cause worry for others. It states Covid-10 rapid diagnosis testing. We tried what was recommended in the time-frame we were allotted. We did not have the time for other options so it is what it is, just a heads up for anyone else submitting this type of test.Best to you all.Edited: 9:58 pm, August 23, 2020 "
"Has anyone who has gotten approval had a test that was CLIA accredited not CAP? We got negative test through the county, however it says through a CLIA lab. We got a second round through what is a CAP lab but not sure results will come in time."
"So glad to hear that! I got approved this afternoon and my flight is at 8am..I think they worked hard today to expedite everyone's submissions... So grateful I found the numbers to call on here otherwise I would have had to cancel my tripEdited: 1:37 am, August 24, 2020 "
Here are several articles on the backlog. Hopefully they have things straightened out. JHTA said the govt created the backlog on purpose. http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/Travel_authorisation_backlog_cleared_%26%238212;_Ministry?profile=1228http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/JHTA_accuses_Gov%26%238217;t_of_delaying_entry_approval_to_visitors?profile=1228
"BL: it’s my understanding that is it’s not a CAP lab, they won’t accept your test and issue you’re travel approval. Want to know for sure? Email them or call, but know they are pretty strict in their guidelines"
Any way for you to upload the image or email a scanned PDF of the image? Presumably everyone that has specifically a Walgreens test would be able to use this as supporting documentation as Walgreens is running only one test for the entire country. It is curious that some Walgreens might be passing along supporting documentation and not others.
I had to set up a separate access with labcorp to get the results on the labcorp letter head used same email as the Walgreens / PWN one and it automatically went to my email and to labcorp app.
Can I ask what are you saying when you call? Are you just saying it’s past the 48 hours and you’re looking for an update? Just wondering if there are key words to get me approved ASAP since it’s past the 48 hours and I have less than 24 hours before I need to change my flight and altert the hotel and my work. Thank you!
I said I was following up on my travel authorization application and they just asked for my name and passport number and told me to check my email. Mine arrived in my inbox about 3 hours later. It was a very quick call- I think they are just trying to move through them as fast as possible.
Thank you! And I’m assuming you were approved?
Update! We resubmitted our Walgreens negative results along with the information packet that Walgreens provided (as someone suggested in this forum - thank you) and a copy of this https:/…RealTime-SARS-CoV-2-AssayWe called and were able to come across a person willing to help and received a travel authorization in ten minutes.
@chitownMS when do you leave?
Tomorrow the 25th
@chitownMS CONGRATS!!!! This is giving me hope!!! Have all the drinks and enjoy!!! Cross your fingers for us!
"I just spoke to a lovely woman who found our request and approved while on the line. It took a few tries over a few numbers to get through, but got it done. We will be traveling on Jamaica on Thursday."
Congrats!!!! Enjoy your trip!
@SunseekerinvermontBrilliant!! How long did it take for your results to populate?
We sent in our info on Saturday. Waited until today to phone. Once I got through on the phone i gave her passport info she put me on hold for about 2 minutes came back said to check emails and they were there within seconds. Not sure when we would have been approved had I not called but hopefully they are caught up. I needed to confirm by tomorrow if I needed to cancel or change plans.
@sunseekerinvermont. Sorry. I should have been clearer. I meant your results from Walgreens in Labcorp portal.
Tested on Wednesday at 4 pm had results in email Friday at 4 pm almost exactly 48 hrs. That is in Vermont we very low numbers and not a lot of testing sites. Our tests were sent to a labcorp lab in Massachusetts.
http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/Travel_authorisation_backlog_cleared_%26%238212;_Ministry?fbclid=IwAR0X67r06BRF6J_toynN81eTMpH3JFXlkCwpg8kuFMB2vuczpMNgBKUG2qg
"idk who you all got on the phone, but no one I've spoken to has said anything about hold on and home back to give me an instant approval"
"I got it, I got it!!!!!"
"Can you provide the number you called, please? We are leaving on Wednesday and have not yet gotten a response."
There are several different numbers that are scattered on this thread. You have to keep redialing through them to get someone (that’s what I did today for my approval )
@sadie j888-783-2703 (be prepared to hold for 30-60 minutes)876-542-5988876-542-6005876-542-6007
"sadie j were you able to locate the numbers?... if not, send me a message"
Is anyone getting an approval today? We are waiting on 1 approval and I got mine yesterday. We were told it would be approved last night and to call if it wasn’t sent. It wasn’t so we called this morning and were told we should hear back by early afternoon. We also sent several emails.
You can also chat with Ministry of Health on WhatsApp at 876-542-6006 to check on your authorization.
Waited an hour and a half and the woman said there was nothing she could do. She said just wait for the email. Asked if an email can be sent to help escalate and she said she doesn’t have that ability which was odd since the other people prior have done so. When mentioned that there are less than 38 hours before our flight she said “oh you have plenty of time”.
The post cut off before I finished! But we called the number below with WhatsApp and were APPROVED!!! Thank you for providing more information!
Did you check the status on the website ? If it was processed it will say so... maybe you’re just not getting the email for some reason?
Does the test need to say RT-PCR or PCR test is ok?
"The website says this: The uploaded test result should include the name and date of birth of the individual tested, name of the laboratory, test type specified as RT-PCR, and test result.But you can call and ask- my lab didn’t say it was CAP but was in their directory."
mine said RNA NAAT PCR and was approved
As long as it says PCR you should be fine. I called in yesterday (albeit 30+ times) but received both mine and my wifes authorization. This thread helped big time!
"I was supposed to get my authorization in 48 hours and it was not like that. I lost my flight, my vacation and my money, I called all the numbers that other passengers recommended and nothing at all. I do not know why they say that we will obtain the permit in 48 hours if not so badly I will not try to go to Jamaica ever again."
"Wendy,I am sorry about your experience. Jamaica is doing the best they can to keep their country safe. These are not NORMAL times at all!!! Nothing can be a guarantee during a world wide pandemic. Since you were not granted permission to enter Jamaica, I would think that some of your costs are refundable. Are you working with your airline and hotel/resort?"
Did anyone have the rapid SARS test with same day results? I'm not sure if this is the same as PCR. I'm freaking out.
"Visit Jamaica website spells out the testing protocols. At this time, your results must come from a CAP accredited lab.Edited: 11:25 am, August 26, 2020 "
I've read everything on the Visit Jamaica website thoroughly. I was just curious because the lab is CAP accredited but when I asked them was it a PCR test they stated that it was the SARS test. I googled and it seemed like they are the same. I was just curious if the rapid test is the type of test that everyone else took.
"It has been almost 3 days, still says it pending. What number should I call?"
"Mark F,If I were you, I would try the numbers already posted in reply #162 and #165"
The What's App number works! Send them a chat message instead of calling. They were responsive and asked for my name and passport number. My husband and I had the authorizations emailed to us within 15 minutes. The number is 1--876-542-6006
They don’t allow you to apply for the authorization until you are 5 days out from travel and they are backlogged so many people are losing hotel and flight fees or incurring change flight fees upward $500 per passenger.
Where does it say “pending?” We leave Sunday morning and I know I’ll get an email but I just want to know where to go to check it.
"Jeanne: it would be nice if it worked that way, but from what I understand, if your trip had to be cancelled, you eat it. I want to say there’s a warning in the website saying to check with your airline about fees. It is sad but like you said, we’re in the middle of a pandemic and people are expecting things to be normal. Nothing is normal and Jamaica is doing their to make this process work as smoothly as possible.Wendy: To say you’ll never visit Jamaica because you couldn’t get approval, during a world pandemic, for your vacation is just down right ridiculous."
I ended up calling this morning ‭1 (876) 542-5998‬I was approved right away She sent the certificate645am no waiting
"Hi! I'm glad you were able to get through. I'm also travelling soon and stressing. What specific number did you call and how, specifically did you resubmit? Did you resubmit via a new application or just upload/amend an old pending one? Any helpful details you can give would be greatly appreciated."
"@NitaNaughty I almost paid $300 to get a rapid test at a local lab until advised to wait and see what the medical professionals at the regular clinic say. The medial professional told me that there is no ""rapid"" PCR test (which is the test required for travel) and that the test required always take at least 2 days for results based on how they are done and the type of result they give. I hope this helps. I'd say just be sure to ask lots of questions and make sure the test is the PCR test. Research the different sites, call your doctor's office, or go into an urgent care clinic.I've had to reschedule my trip several times but I trust God. Any ""delay"" is probably for my good. I'm praying that all goes well, I can get approved and keep it moving! God bless and good luck to you!"
"@B L The ""pending"" status is on your application page when you go to the JamCovid website. Also, you would have received a confirmation email that your application was received and pending. I hope this helps and good luck to you!"
@NitaNaughtyIt cannot be a rapid same day test. It must be a PCR test sent to an accredited lab.
"Hi, does the Covid test have to say PCR? My status is currently pending and I’ve seen people say it’s because the form doesn’t say PCR."
Thank you. I found a CVS that did a PCR test thats sent to an accredited lab.
"For people worried about not getting approved in time, you might want to look into whether travel insurance might cover it. There are a few (only a few) policies that cover COVID-related reasons https:/…"
"That's good news @NitaNaughty. I'm still waiting for my approval as well. I've called the numbers listed in the thread and have not yet gotten through, however, I've also taken my attention off of it as to not stress myself so much. I pray all goes well. My flight is in a few days."
Yes my friend just got her travel authorization approved somewhere between midnight Saturday and 3 am Sunday morning. I’m Waiting for mines and we suppose to Be traveling tomorrow
"I called 1(876-542-5998) literally 67 times no joke. I actually counted. I was very very frustrated because I leave tomorrow 8am in the morning to Jamaica. I submitted my travel authorization 2 days prior because that’s all it’ll allow me to do. If I didn’t call trust me I would have to reschedule. Call and don’t stop!!! You will get someone , I’ve been calling from 7AM (6AM ) their time and I got thru at 10AM exact time. Keep calling guys don’t give up and yes they do answer on weekends, I did this on a Sunday!!"
"People have said the Lab Corp Pixel is accepted, I will be doing it as well, you have to upload no sooner than 5 days,. They have a accreditation page that lists the CAP no for each lab.Edited: 4:58 pm, August 30, 2020 "
@SboomFWI did mine last night and needed to upload two different pics because one result document had a big Negative on it and the other didn't but the other had the lab info and the latter didn't. It only let's you upload one file. So I had to go make a collage of the two documents and upload it. I hope they accept it. I'm a nervous wreck also.
@SboomFW I think you just select whichever file and upload it. I don't think there's a specific format.
Does cvs pharmacy work for travel authorization
Is cvs pharmacy ok for testing for covid
So happy for you but not so much for me. They said at home kit (Pixel) results are not approved. I give up on going to Jamaica. Weve had to jump through too many hoops. Happy and safe travels to everyone!
"NicPark , Really? A few people had said they used it and it was fine.Edited: 7:39 am, yesterday "
@Winnie. I was hoping I would have been one of those lucky people to get approved. Apparently not. I’m exhausted. This is too stressful.
Likewise! Submitted my travel auth on Saturday for travel on Thursday and received the approval at 2am this morning. I was fully prepared to be on the phone all day Tuesday and Wednesday.
"Updated test info from Visit Jamaica..IMPORTANT: COVID-19 PCR test required for some countriesAll residents of the United States of America (USA), Brazil, Dominican Republic or Mexico who are 12 years of age or over, are required to obtain a COVID-19 PCR test to submit a Travel Authorization application. Uploaded results using home test kits (ex. Pixel by LabCorp), along with antibody and antigen tests are NOT accepted. The sample should be collected no more than 10 days before the intended travel date, at a medical laboratory that is accredited by the relevant national health authorities. For the United States of America, the medical laboratory should be accredited by the College of American Pathologists (CAP)."
The web site now says pixel home test are not accepted.
Is this a kit you ordered or did you have walgreens do the trst in the drive thru ?
"Laura, It was a kit you ordered from LabCorp Pixel home test, it was being accepted now it's not.Edited: 6:39 am, today "
"Kristie, Did you get your test done at a national pharmacy chain?Thanks"
No. My doctor sent me to Passport Health.
"I tried to get tested at CVS and was told (on their website) that i don't qualify for the test (no symptoms). So now that it's become more difficult in the US to get tested, i wonder if that will change any of the criteria."
"There is currently (and actually has been) a serious push to constrict testing in the United States for political reasons. Keep trying - you are in California, we do things differently here!"
"Iangosta,Are you sure you didn't have a runny nose the other day??? Maybe you have been possibly exposed to COVID at the grocery store??? I think just about everyone has been possibly exposed at some point in public."
The problem with lying about that Brian is that if it shows up on the lab report you will not get authorization to travel to Jamaica.
"did you get your approvalEdited: 2:19 pm, today "
Does it update on the website or do you wait for the email
