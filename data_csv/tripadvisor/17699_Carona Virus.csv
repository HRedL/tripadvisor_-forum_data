"Hi, I'm suppost to travel to Europe in October. Although it's far away , is it safe to carry on planning my trip?"
Its impossible to know what the situation will be by then. I have two upcoming trips... One next week and one in April. I'm thinking they will probably not happen now....We were planning another trip in August but decided to leave it for now.
Why would you ask here? That's just silly. Nobody here has a crystal ball that can look into the future. You need to figure this out for your self and make a decision.
"If you really want to go, wait and see. If you don't want to, see what you need to do for refund- or, if one is available.So far out, you won't automatically get a refund for 'change of mind', I don't think.We're still planning to travel to Amsterdam in July. If we can't travel, we won't go. Simple."
I hope that if you've booked anything Non refundable eg flights or accommodation You’ve already taken out travel insurance.

We haven't booked anything yet
"I was asking what would be the wisest thing to do. - The situation is changing almost on a daily basis, if it was me I would not make any new travel plans or bookings until the situation is resolved"
"How in the name of all things would we know how risk averse you are? Many will still be travelling at that time, but others will not. Stand in front of a mirror and ask the same question."
"I too have travel plans for June. Not too far in the future. As things stand right now, I do not think I can go ahead with the plans. I have non refundable international flight tickets, but I am hopeful the airlines will consider free change of dates, if not cancellations. But as of now they are allowing changes only for bookings till March end. They might extend the dates as things go further.Regarding your October dates, it really might not be your choice. Countries will have travel restrictions in place and you could get quarantined at any point for 15 days. As of now, it would be wise not to buy non-refundable tickets and block dates only where it is not a firm commitment from your end."
"October is a good while away but I certainly would make no major plans for travel at the moment and if I did I would make sure everything was fully refundable.I do have plans to travel in the middle of May a trip I booked several months ago,both flights and accommodation are non-refundable but the company I have annual travel insurance with contacted me a few days ago and said anything non refundable booked before any travel ban comes into force would be covered by my annual policy."
"Yesterday I had plans to go to Germany, Switzerland, Miami and San Francisco (twice) in the coming months. Today I don't have any of those plans any more.It is possible that this outbreak will run its course by the summer, China is already saying that the peak has passed there, so hopefully some form of normality will return by October."
"Flycat,By the time October comes and at the rate of exponential growth of the virus as explained in the fabulous video linked to in the sticky above ( covid-19 affecting US/Canadians), everyone left alive on the planet would have already gotten it. Therefore it should be all over and safe to travel again - until the next thing."
"Echoing others - If I were to book anything new I'd make sure everything is fully refundable. And take travel insurance.I have one trip coming next month (London) but my travel insurance only covers cancellations for trips to ""epidemic areas""."
"Hi. Thanks for the advise guys to those who were polite. I think Ill book with full refund. Peace outEdited: 6:08 am, March 12, 2020 "
"I think that the only solution is to wait! We can't know or plan anything now, and October seems so far away, I think that by that time the virus will be gone (or at least all this isolation and danger with travels)"
"Tom: Just silly to ask strangers what ""the wisest thing to do"" is. We don't know you or anything about you. Only you or your closest friends can make that decision for you."
"Tom wasn’t asking, he was quoting the previous poster. Most unlike you TallandCool to dive into a thread and respond without thinking."
"OP,I feel your pain, and share your concerns, BUT, as stated, the situation is highly volatile.Wife runs over 200 medical facilities and hospitals. She now gets updates from CDC (USA) 4x per day, up from 1x day a bit over a week ago. Same for updates from her corporate CMO, same for AZ Health, and every 2-3 days from WHO. She is definitely “in the know,” as of this very moment.However, and with all of that said, we have about 6 trips on the books, including one to London, at the moment. We have been taking all of this under advisement, and still do not have any hard, firm answers.I can imagine the consternation of so very many, who do not have such direct contact.What will April bring? Heck, what will Saturday 14th bring??No good answers, other than to try to stay informed, then consider everything.Best of luck,Hunt"
"As others have mentioned, no one knows what it will be in October. Another thing is also the financial health of the airlines: a few have gone bankrupt already and probably more will do. If you purchase tickets useable only in a while make sure to get proper protections. The same goes if you accept a voucher instead of a reimbursement.."
Thank you Hunt
Cash is king. I applied for a refund for my departing flight last night instead of a rebooking. Safer that way.
"Yip. Best to see what the future will bring. We hope for the best. Nothing booked yet. Just have dates. The virus has only hit our shores now. People are going crazy and stocking up. My poor friend is a travel agent and she's struggling badly.Edited: 3:13 am, March 15, 2020 "
Tall and cool - why so mean? They’re just asking advice on a platform of people offering advice...
Hope this will be all over and good by October. I’m going to Poland in May and am really hopeful to still go on that trip.
"That makes all of us. Well, I have hope as things are improving in China now ,that it will be a wave that will blow over and we will be able to say thanks for the memories very soon."
