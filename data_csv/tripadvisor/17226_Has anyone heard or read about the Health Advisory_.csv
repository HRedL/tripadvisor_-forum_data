"ctv.ca/servlet/…(have to copy & paste the link)I won't let it ruin my vacation, but one can't help but worry about getting an illness like this! "
" People have finally started to understand that the tourist areas of Mexico are safe, and now a new potential issue. Lets keep one eye open and hope it is not a problem in Cabo. "
"I've never worried about the safety, I'm more at risk here in Vancouver with the current gang wars... but man, this ""flu"" sounds awful, and we heard on the news that 20 people have died. Yikes... Wash your hands often peeps! "
Hi Yalumba: I heard Steve and Lynn broadcasting this story on the morning news today. I thought it sounded a bit like SARS. You are right to keep doing the hand washing and stay educated but I am always reminded the news does tend to blow things .... well you know. 
"wOW! Creepy, isn't it."
"Im sure it is a reaction to the battle we had here with Sars, but it is scary. I am not going to alter my plans, but maybe a trip to Clinic for flu shot? Think this is over reacting? We leave Monday, think it's too late for shot?"
I live here. There is no flu epidemic in Los Cabos. I have seen nothing in the US news about this. I'm not worried.
"There hasn't been anything in our news either, and none of the people I know that live there have mentioned it. The article also mentions it is in South and Central Mexico, not Baja. "
"A report was just posted on AP. The flu is currently centered in Mexico City, about 800 cases nationwide. 20 have reportedly died from whatever this is nationwide with 13 of those deaths in Mexico City."
"I'm with you bc4me, on how the news tends to ""tweak"" the stories to scare or whatever their agenda is."
"Again, I'm not stressing out about this, but people should just be aware of it, so they can see their doctor when they get home, should they exhibit any symptoms. As for it not being in Baja, this link: http://www.canada.com/health/Health+officials+watch+after+mystery+Mexican+outbreak/1525963/story.htmlmentions Baja, ""The flu-like symptoms include fever, cough, general aches and pains and shortness of breath, which quickly progresses to trouble breathing and severe respiratory illness, she said.The affected areas of Mexico were Mexico City, San Luis Potosl, Oaxaca and Baja, Skowronski said.""I don't think there is any need to be afraid, but there is the need to be aware.  Myself, I'll be on the beach in Cabo in 8 days! yahoooo! "
Ironically the Dallas local news are apparently reporting that the disease started in the U.S. and was brought to Mexico by traveling Americans. But it is serious - I believe the death toll is now over 70 and Mexico City and the state of Mexico have closed schools for a day.
"Have there been any reports that Los Cabos is a part of this unfortunate flu breakout?Currently, Mexico City plus 2 other smaller areas are the targeted areas."
Here is a link to a pretty complete assessment of the virus:comcast.net/articles/…Both the WHO and the CDC said there was no need to alter travel arrangements in Mexico or the United States.The CDC said it will issue daily updates at www.cdc.gov/flu/swine/investigation.htm.
"CDC and WHO have not issued travel warning (which is a big deal that would cost Mexico millions, maybe billions, if done hastily).But, both are ""very, very concerned"" because they have never seen an avian combined with swine flu and then being transmissible to humans, as well as the deaths being in the healthy population more than the usual vulnerable.That was the hallmark of 1918 pandemic...it predominantly killed twenty-somethings and probably had to do with that generation not having had the older generations bouts with previous flus. Every time you have a flu or get a flu shot, it adds to your immune factor. You can be exposed or innoculated with a non-identical flu and still get some protection based on some familiarity.That is just another good reason why getting a shot every year is smart...because each shot gives you three different killed virus flu's, and each year they change the flu shot to account for that years mutations.Think of the science behind the native Americans falling like flies to common European illnesses because Indians had no similar immune agents in their arsenal.It is the totally new virus' that are so dangerous."
"All that said, I wouldn't cancel an upcoming trip to Baja because it IS isolated from mainland but maybe you'd like it if your flight didn't stop and board passengers from Texas or LA?I'd go get a flu shot tomorrow.Flus, unlike the common cold or bacterial illnesses, are most often spread by airborne droplets, so while the handwashing certainly goes a long way, you can still easily breathe in the aerosolized virus.Hand sanitizers, not anti-bacterials (which are problematic), are good as the alcohol in them breaks apart the viral cells...mchanically opens them rather than killing them chemically."
"Tamiflu is an antiviral that if taken w/in 48 hours can lessen and shorten flu. 24 hours is really better time frame.Recently though, there have been some conflicting reports on its' efficacy.Wonder how hard tamiflu is to obtain in Cabo?"
i'm quite concern too...we're going to los cabos the end of this may...but we can't cancel our vacation...is there any update? is los cabos effected with this virus?
"WHO and others convened in Geneva yesterday, deciding whether to call emergency which would trigger travel advisories or bans. They are holding off to get more information.I'd stay tuned and luckily your travel date is end of May. The difficulty is people with plans in next two weeks and wondering.I'd see if it wasn't too late to get travel insurance for such cancellations."
"Los Cabos is NOT isolated from mainland Mexico when it comes to an communicable illness such as this. (S.I.R.Given the amount of international planes (Can, US and MX) that arrive at SJD on any given day... all it takes is one infected individual to bring it over. Distance, in this case, is not really a deterrent. SARS originated in Asia (China, if I'm not mistaken) and surfaced in Toronto, Canada.... but nowhere else. Toronto was more isolated geographically from China, but air travel closed the gap.Let's hope for the best...hey, I wan to go back to Cabo as much as anyone!!!"
"And we're one of those many I'm sure, that are leaving for Cabo in exactly two weeks, May 9. Three days ago we were so looking forward to this getaway to relax and enjoy some sun and surf, however now I'm not so sure about the relaxing part.Still no travel advisories here in Canada, yet, and hopefully it won't get to that. With 14 days to go before we leave, as this point we're just watching each day for further news/information.E&L "
"Epidemiologists said that because this hit a dense, 20 million population, and the same strain was appearing in Texas and California, that any quarantining, border control, etc. would simply be politically, not medically driven.Meaning, epidemiologically, the virus would be incubating in many geographical areas, ALREADY.That is what WHO and CDC mean when they say, ""too late to contain."" Again, the best thing you could do at this point was just go get a flu shot if you didn't get one this year. It is uncertain whether the current flu shot will offer protection but there is probability it would, even just lessing symptoms.Wikipedia has an interesting piece on the 1918 pandemic. As a story, it is fascinating."

"I'm wondering how many people that are worried about the ""swine flu"" and are concerned about traveling to Cabo......SMOKE A PACK AND HALF A DAY!!!!"
"I've never smoked once in my life. I think people are well within their rights to have concerns. There is NOTHING wrong with education and knowledge before you travel. Once again, I AM traveling to Cabo in 7 days. I am aware of where the swine flu has been infecting people, (not Cabo so far) but I am also aware of the potential for the disease to travel. Education, awareness and hygeine are your friends. "
"Yalumba, Not sure if you've caught the Global morning news here in Vancouver, they have reported that two severe cases of flu, not confirmed swine flu, have been reported in Canada. One in West Vancouver where a woman is very sick and just returned from Cabo, the other is reported in Halifax...don't know any details on that.Not intending to scare anyone, but this is definately a situation that we have to think about. Sure, as some people have posted on this forum that x number of people die in car accidents in x city...yet you still drive...and you can get a cold or the sniffles from just about anywhere now-a-days...but here we are dealing with a situation of trying to contain or stop this particular flu from spreading around the globe...that may be too late already considering the way people travel these days.It really is about containment...and from what I've read this ""swine flu"" virus spreads very easily.The best thing is to stay informed with what is being reported by the health organizations. Sure we would be disappointed if we end up cancelling our trip to Cabo...however, I don't believe Cabo is going to disappear and there's always another time.E&L "
"It seems to me the people who are set to leave in the next week are in a tough place. In a week to ten days WHO and CDC will know what is what and decision-making will be easier.The thing to watch is whether the adults that get swine flu, outside of Mexico, get normally ill or seriously ill. The kids in New York got mildly ill...so wait and see how adults fare.If this turns out to be a normal flu, not a big whoop. If it turns out to be a serious flu, then we will be dealing with an issue much bigger than whether we go on vacation or not.1918 flu killed 50-100 million (HIV globally killed 25 million over 25 years...so that is big) and the highest mortality age was 25-45 years."
"We all have to worry about health and safety especially as we are finding new germs and new crimes seem to be abundant. I am not sure if you are aware of a hand sanitizer product made in your local area that is unique in North America, Health canada approved and kills the norwalk virus and H1N1, in a comparison test study, other alcohol tested sanitizer did not kill norwalk. T36 regards"
