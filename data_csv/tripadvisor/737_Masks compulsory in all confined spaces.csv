"From Saturday 11 July it will be compulsory for those aged 12 or over to wear masks in confined spaces throughout Belgium, the rule already applies to public transport.Confined spaces include shops, shopping centres, markets, bars, restaurants, cinemas, museums and other attractions.In bars and restaurants the masks may be removed while you are actually seated at a table.Failure to wear a mask where it is required may well result in a hefty police fine."
Thanks Becasse for alerting us. Do you know what the reason for this decision is? Is there an increase in Covid-19 cases?
"No, no increase.Simply bowing to increased pressure from scientist (virologists mainly) who have been dreaming of an opportunity like this to control the population for decades."
"The number of new cases hasn't been going down, which is probably due to increased testing. However, there have been clear signs that people had started to get more ""relaxed"" about the strong advice to wear masks in shops. Now, from tomorrow they will have to, and the relaxations that all Belgians have been enjoying won't be put at risk by the selfish actions of a few."
#2: fortunately (for you) tin foil hats are still cheap to make yourself.
"Well, in the Netherlands no-one wears a mask except on public transport. In German speaking Switzerland, the same.I have seen zero evidence that wearing a mask everywhere achieves any better result. If such evidence existed, like if many people had actually been contaminated in shops, ... I'm sure it would have been widely used as proof. So I think it is not the case.Now I'm not against wearing a mask in supermarkets, ... I do it personally.I'm against politicians, experts, medias, using fear as a weapon and creating a real psychosis in the population."
"No 'government' obligation to wear masks for your visit to bars and restaurants, although the owner himself can decide the obligation. Same rule is applicable for zoo, theme park, outside markets and (inside and open) playgrounds."
"Indeed Ronny, from what I can find reported by Belgian media, the government rule to wear a mask doesn’t apply to cafes, restaurants, markets, casinos, zoos and theme parks.But all of these locations can decide for themselves that customers/visitors must wear a mask. A rather confusing situation, if I may say so....Edited: 12:37 pm, July 10, 2020 "
"Yes, BTG, sometimes a bit confusing.BTW masks compulsory in casinos (Ref MB 10 July 2020, Art 4. 8°)Edited: 3:40 pm, July 10, 2020 "
#4 possibly my favourite TA post ever!!!
"I'd rather wear a tin foil hat than a face mask when I go shopping.Luckily, just over the border from Belgium, in the Netherlands, I need neither."
"“ 4 possibly my favourite TA post ever!!!”It’s says a lot about someone when a post in which another human being is put down for having an opinion they don’t agree with, is their favourite TA post ever.While kbbcn may have worded things differently than I would do, I too wonder why the Belgian government has suddenly made mouth masks mandatory. Well, if anything the shops in the towns and cities just across the border in the Netherlands will profit. There were already a lot of visitors from Belgium in my hometown Breda yesterday. I know they were mainly here because of the Flemish holiday, but I spoke to a few of them and they all mentioned the mandatory masks. I won’t repeat what they thought of their government’s decision, but it’s safe to say that shoppers from Belgium will continue to go shopping in the Netherlands.Edited: 3:52 am, July 12, 2020 "
"The number of cases increases very slightly, like in several other European countries, but I don't think it is related to shops or the like. Rather that people and mostly young people meet and congregate frequently in close contact with each other. And that increases with the holidays. It is normal and it was predictable.We also know there is a problem with the contact tracing. Some infected people will not tell anything to the authorities. It's rather logical too.In Belgium in general there is a distrust towards the governments and the politicians. And authoritarian politics, like it is the case with masks here, conflict with the, in my opinion better, message that everyone should act responsibly."
"I found the #2 remark funny too. It was only a joke. Probably because of ""the decades"". I found it a wise decision to make masks compulsory, because people never keep enough distance. Same rules in Germany, which I visited last week. Even in the hotels, bars/restaurants you have to wear masks (except when sitting at a table)."
Let's not forget thiis latest twist. https:/…3634eb6316f1
"As I predicted in #12, the number of cases is increasing. Maybe foreigners should not plan coming to Belgium anymore.The mask will not produce much of a positive result."
"Quite right, I am old enough that the tin foil hat just made me laugh out loud. But at least nobody here has offered up 5G as the virus problem!We are just so used to wearing masks here in Toronto, Canada it would seem strange to NOT wear one. And briefly off topic, I am apparently as thick as they come, and I cannot figure out either government website (seriously can’t). Are Canadians allowed in to Belgium but must quarantine for 14 days (unlike France)? My head is spinning, I am getting my France Belgium UK Italy research all muddled. Help!"
"No. Canadians are not allowed to enter Belgium.And you are not thick, an avalanche of regulations in each country, and they introduce new one everyday, nobody can follow.Edited: 1:34 am, July 23, 2020 "

You are correct. Canadians are still not allowed to enter Belgium.I found an official source in English here https://reopen.europa.eu/en/map/BELI will remove my earlier post.
Thank you Pierre!
