Just wondering if there are any specific vacinations we should get.I get conflicting info.
"At lot of people get the Hep A & B shot just to be on the safe side. Its really your choice, however isn't it better to be safe than sorry. Most health plans pay for it anyway. Its also not that expensive when your talking about your health. I know you'll hear people on this forum saying I've been to Cuba 27 times and have never had any issues but it only takes 1 time. Again your choice. Have a great trip. When are you leaving and where are you staying. 29 sleeps till Cayo Santa Maria.Cheers"
"Hi,Actually not.Just some important things:1)Don't drink water from the tap if you don't want to spend your holidays in the toilets! (except perhaps on some resorts).2) Bring medicines for disentery and salts for rehidratation.3) Bring toilet paper (it's almost impossible to find except in the hotels or casa particular)4) last year there was a big epidimic of DENGUE, especially in LA HAVANA. Nobody knows how mmany people died ( perhaps few hundreds, perhaps few thousands), so bring the necessary to keep the mosquitos away.Pakito"
"I'm sorry this questions comes up A LOT on many different forums and I don't mean to be rude, or offend anyone because I have found a lot of great advise on this web site and have had lots of fun with the many fantastic TA members.But you are on a forum asking a bunch of total strangers who don't know you and who you don't know for... medical advice.Isn't that why you have a family doctor or do you not trust their medical advice. If you trust your doctor that little it's time to find a new doctor not ask a bunch of strangers.Would you pick up the phone book and randomly pick 5-10 names and call them to ask about your medical treatment?? It is the same thing."
"Hi,certainly you're right, but does all the doctors know about the dengue epidemic? It has been kept under secret by the Cuban government and only very few newspaper mentioned it.Pakito"
"Don't forgot the most important vacination, it is called the Mojito, it prevents Touronitis.......we could all do with a few less tourons!"
"dengue fever is endemic to Cuba, it has not been kept under raps.That is why there is travel medicine clinics. So a Doctor can give you medical adivse.Hep A and Hep B are also something to be concerned with but you advised there is no need for vaccines."
"My doctor recommended that I get Hep A and B shots. Just received my second shot this morning! I've been to travel clinics in the past, they are very helpful and have up to date information. It's good to visit them well in advance of your departure date so you have the right amount of time for your vaccinations and other prescriptions to be effective. My doctor prescribes antibiotics as a precaution, to be taken (only) in case I come down with a nasty case of illness due to something i may have ingested along with my food. I've never had to take it but it gives me piece of mind.Like our noble president sweetpeaagnew advises, see your own doctor for the best advice. Wash out your TALL mug every day."
"sweetpeaagnew,You raise a very good point. No one should take medical advice as a given.I was surprised at the lack of consistant info I was reading.I remember years ago that for some South American countries that the info was consistant. I will contact the travel clinic and ask. I just wish I knew before hand what they may say. I do not want any unnecessary vacinations.I know that recently their were warnings on the news, I was asking if someone remembered what was said for which countries. It was some Carribian countries and Mexico."
what exactly is dengue fever. and what are the symptoms. Just curious.
"Contacting a travel Medicine clinic is the best way to go, our family doctor keeps up with all the latest information because he has many patients who travel a lot so I trust his advise. Some family doctors are not up to date with travel vaccinations and that is why the travel clinic is your better choice.this link will give you a list of Travel Medicine clinics in Quebecphac-aspc.gc.ca/tmp-pmv/â€¦qcTravellers should visit 4-8 weeks before departure.Here is what you ""MAY"" be told: Hep A&B (Twin rix)They will check if your other vaccinations are up to date: Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)Two doses recommended for all travelers born after 1956, if not previously given and Tetanus-diphtheria Revaccination recommended every 10 yearsRabiesVaricella (chickenpox) if you are over 1 year and have not had chicken pox before.they may suggest dukoral (for those who are susetable to tummy troubles)Typhoid~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~For those of you not in Quebec, this link will list all travel Medicine clinics in Canada just click on your province and find your town or city.phac-aspc.gc.ca/tmp-pmv/travel/clinic_e.html"
