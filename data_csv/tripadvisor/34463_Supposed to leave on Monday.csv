Just wondering if we should still go from USA or cancel?
"Hum I guess Cayman is still letting cruise ships dock. First case was an italian visitor from cruise ship. Any island that allows cruise ships will be having cases of the virus. Personal decision...if you flight is still going then you have to decide your comfort level. Considerations are general health,, age and tolerance for risk.. Things are changing minute to minute."
"I see they are denying cruise ships on Monday and bans have been put in place come Monday. They aren't denying us in yet, but things may change come Monday. No gatherings of more than 50 people anywhere. Will restaurants be open if they have to restrict people?"
Agree with it being a fluid situation. We arrived today and so far everything has been good. But things are changing. Today they announced beginning Monday they will restrict cruises. I think it’s a good decision for health. But sadly it will affect caymans economy.
I am sure the travel ban will include the US within days. Link below. https:/…
"Auddy I totally agree with you. I am willing to bet they’re going to start restricting travelers from the US. I can’t imagine it will be much longer and I’m hoping that will be the case. As bad as I want to go in one month from today, I know it’s not realistic anymore. It sucks horribly and I’m so upset about it but I don’t think I’d even have fun at this point with all that’s going on."
"If I were leaving Monday & no ban was in place, I would certainly go and enjoy!"
"Unfortunately we just cancelled, Ritz was forcing my hand as they wouldn’t extend our 21 day cancellation period. We were going with 3 families and 8 kids for spring break. They shut our schools down today in SoCal.... too much uncertainty right now. Once we start testing in greater numbers the US numbers will grow rapidly and I have no doubt they will ban travel from the US. American Airlines would only give us a credit, no refund. Every other airline I have been dealing with has given us a full refund. Reinforces my preference to not fly American..."
That is bad to her about AA. We are scheduled to go to GC in a month on AA. I am hoping things are better then and we will still be able to go.
Lots of cancellations and closings are coming in as a result of yesterday’s restrictions. Restaurants will be hard put to be able to remain open with the 50 people only policy. The hotels are already cutting hours. There may be more sweeping announcements on Monday. I would reschedule our trip if it was me.
We are staying in a villa on the beach near Kaibo with our family. We are flying AA too. We will be making most of our meals from home while in GC. Cayman Villas will only switch dates to this summer and that doesn't work for us. Thinking we will just go. There is 10 people in our party. The excursion people said they will still be doing the excursions.
"We are due to arrive on GC April 18th. I need to cancel my condo by March 19th in order to get my deposit back. I still want to go, if possible, but I don't want to lose my deposit. And I am worried about them restricting US visitors in the coming weeks. I think I will call and cancel my condo, but keep my flights and if the y haven't put restrictions on US visitors, I will call and rebook the condo a day or 2 before hand (assuming they have units available). Is that awful?"
We are here and still happy we came. In condo. I reposted the newest restrictions just so you know what is going on here.
"It would be very surprising if the travel ban from USA is not put in place within days given the current state of things and what Cayman has already enacted. Even for those who do feel okay about going, one of the US national news reports today said everyone returning to the USA from other countries must now self quarantine for 14 days....a factor you need to seriously consider.Edited: 9:35 am, March 14, 2020 "
Yes keep in mind you may get there unless GC shuts down. You may not get home in a timely manner or without a quarantine.B.
"lovecayman - where did you hear that about self-quarantine after all international travel? I heard that from my in-laws last night, but after extensive internet research I can find no confirmation of that."
"It was on a Boston, MA television news program. Hard to determine how accurate reports really are these days, but given the official “national emergency” declaration, it is certainly likely."
what happened with AA?
"Facts. As yet, the Cayman Islands are not on the CDC list of countries one will be ""ASKED"", not required, to self-quarantine when returing to the USA.https:/…after-travel-precautions.htmlThat could of course all change, but that's what the US government is currently advising."
What is the grocery store situation?
For the state of R.I. the Governor has said anyone traveling from abroad is to self quarantine for 14 days. Perhaps due to a Covid case affecting a person who lives in the state and recently vacationed in the Bahamas.
The grocery situation is messy. Hopefully it is just a knee jerk reaction. We have just been assured that supply lines will remain open. That said we were also assured that the victim who was brought here and died would pose no risk as the caregivers we’re experienced in handling quarantined patients.
"We were to fly in on Tuesday the 17th but cancelled yesterday. Flying AA meant only a credit for future travel before one year from purchase of tickets - so we have to use the credit by end of October!:( Thankfully the condo (Plantana) was very generous in telling us they plan to refund us in full when we don't by contract deserve one cent back. So thankful! We were so looking forward to this first trip but btwn our work conference being cancelled & our kids both having school/colleges shut down here in CA, it felt reckless & ill-advised to travel anywhere far from home. Sheltering in place at home for the next week weeks it looks like. I do not regret our decision to cancel but I believe I would have regretted going forward with our trip."
"Im scheduled to leave Tuesday night. My B&B has not yet responded to questions about re-scheduling or even how they are handling things at their establishment. Nor are they answering the phone either. Sigh.Per the website, no refunds/reschedule within 30 days of travel. It a lot of $$ to be out right now. I would love to reschedule for the fall if I could."
"Susan I am in GC looking at CNN right now. I am looking at footage from Chicago, O’Hare It is Americans returning home. Why would you put yourself or your family through this. An awful lot of people are going to lose much more money than their vacay money. It really should not be a priority at this time. People here are out trying to comply with the new restrictions put in place on daily life for themselves and their family. We are expecting more stringent restrictions tomorrow. What do you think they can tell you? What is your cancellation policies? Do you have trip insurance? These are your guidelines in this unprecedented global situation. Put the news on.Edited: 1:13 pm, March 15, 2020 "
