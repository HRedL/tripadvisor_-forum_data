"Has Mia addressed the nation in the last 6 days?The Minister of Health is calling covid-19 a ""bad flu"" which it clearly is not. That should be corrected.loopnewsbarbados.com/content/barbados-govern…https:/…index.html"
She addressed the nation last night.
"Alexjbim, what did she have to say?"
"Entertainment events and large gatherings with more than 100 people are to be postponed for the next three months as a precautionary measure against the potential spread of the COVID-19 virus. Prime Minister Mia Mottley made the announcement on Monday night as she updated the nation on the island's preparedness plan for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).While the country remains in the preparedness stage, Government has determined that all events on the We Gatherin’ cultural calendar where more than 100 people are expected to attend, will be restricted if there is a confirmed case of the virus. . The Prime Minister also indicated any large events or Crop Over events scheduled within the next three months must be postponed. “We do recognize that there are some large events that people are planning particularly that may lead to outlay in advertising, the outlay in buying supplies and food and we are advising those persons to reschedule their events. Any event within the next three months to be rescheduled until later this year or next year. ,” Mottley remarked in her national address. “Although we haven’t had a case yet, we don’t want people to spend money only to be told within less than 24 hours that they need to cancel. . . . We need to do things to keep the spirit of the population up but we are going to have to pull back on the larger scaled events for now."" Mottley also advised persons over the age of 70 to refrain from attending large gatherings. She recommended that they should self-quarantine during the next 12 weeks. The Prime Minister encouraged all citizens to protect themselves and their family members during this time. “I am appealing to all Barbadians that we each have to take care of ourselves, take in all the measures from washing your hands to not touching your face to all the things the ministry of health is guiding you to do, distancing as far as possible but at the same time to recognize that we need to take care of all of the more vulnerable, our grandparents, our mothers, fathers, and aunts whoever they are and to help them minimize going out. What we want to do is to protect them at all cost, we can’t shut down from the world fully.”"
"We Gatherin’ has become a casualty of the coronavirus preparedness action, while more than a dozen major public events and festivals over the next three months are expected to be called off under Government’s advice.Make this correction to first paragraph “The Government’s year-long series of events designed to bring Barbadians abroad back home has been suspended while promoters and planners have been urged to cancel concerts and shows. Cancellation of least three national festivals – Oistins Fish Festival, Barbados Reggae Festival and Gospelfest – appears imminent.While Crop Over has not been called off, pre-launch events are also expected to be affected, the Prime Minister said on national television during an interview tonight.The Prime Minister said: “We have made a determination that all gatherings larger than 100 would be restricted after we reached Stage One.“We haven’t reached there yet, but we do recognize that there are some large events that people are planning, particularly that may lead to only an advertising outlet in buying supplies and food. And it may be ways we are advising those persons to reschedule their events.She continued: “Any event within the next three months to reschedule it until later in the year or next year. Why? Because even though we haven’t had a case yet, you don’t want people to spend money, only to be told within less than 24 hours that they need to cancel.”When questioned specifically about Crop Over Mottley said the Government is looking at a 12-week period in the first instance.“Crop Over events that are early have to be held back. The music can go out. We can enjoy music without necessarily being out there. If it comes to that we will have to take those decisions going forward.“There was a time with the polio outbreak and they had to postpone Carnival to May so that these things are not unknown to us. But at this stage, the Government is looking at a 12-week horizon.”The Prime Minister also revealed that St Thomas We Gatherin’ events set for this coming weekend have been called off. The events affected are on Saturday: Harvest Market & Nature Expo, Rum Shop Crawl, Discover Rock Hall Village, Rum Shop Tipple Country Style Karaoke and on Sunday: Rally & Vaucluse Andrew Philips Memorial Rally and the Friends and Family Gatherin’ Service.The Prime Minister explained: “We’ve said, for example, for the We Gatherin’ mass base activity on Saturday and Sunday, don’t have it because we don’t want vendors to go and buy food and then find out that they’re out of pocket.“If you have a case on Thursday or Friday and the Government has to cancel the event, suddenly you’re not out of pocket. I have told the We Gatherin’ secretariat to start looking at more virtual ways of engagements because we connect even if we are not connecting physically.“I speak to my niece in Australia on a regular basis and I can’t touch her but I can speak to her.”But the Prime Minister said she is still encouraging everyone to keep the spirit of We Gatherin’ alive.She said: “We feel that the spirit of We Gatherin’, particularly the ideas forum and maybe you can find a way of virtual karaoke. But there are things that people can do especially to hold the interest a lot of the older people.“Patrick Gollop used to have a programme that reflected the spirit of Barbados; one was Heartbreak Hotel.“The point is we need to do things to keep the spirit of the population up but we gonna have to pull back on the larger scale events for now.”"
So would that close down Oistins for example or the street party at Holetown? Westie was saying that Lonestar was packed out the other night I guess they will have to limit the number of guests they allow in. Any other restaurants with a good-sized seating capacity will have to do the same.Just thoughts that have sprung to my mind.
"As visitors stop traveling to Barbados and locals start social distancing, there will be no need for restaurants to do anything - they will be lucky to survive, much less be crowded! Sad reality."
"If Mia did - momentarily - take her eye of the ball, it was probably because of the current situation in Guyana where it appears that election rigging is back in fashion."
"Mia appears to have taken sensible and prompt action ...very soon after the first confirmed casesSocial isolation is probably the best way to stop or slow the spreadSomething we have yet to learn in the UKEdited: 10:42 am, March 19, 2020 "
"MDP you are making very sweeping statements regarding the UK. Most off my friends and family are adopting social distancing practices, only coming in to contact with others when we need to. We have stopped visiting the local pub, stopped using public transport, stopped eating out, suspended gym membership etc etc etc, it’s difficult even after only a few days but we’re sticking with it. Within our community we have established volunteering networks to offer support and assistance to those who need it. We are listening to the experts, we may not agree with them, we may think advice arrived too late, we may think there should be more enforcement but...... We may all have our own views on the best solution but I for one prefer to rely on the experts. Let’s stop all the negativity and work together locally, nationally and globally to overcome this crisis, we are all in this together!!!"
"Chris .... I agree with you 100 % ...and my wife and I and many of our friends ( most of which are in or close to the 'vulnerable group') are social distancing..which IMO is the most sensible way of beating the virus .... other than my wife I have not been near another human being now for 4 days ....and that was at a distance of 12' at my allotment We now have WhatsApp exchanges with my son and the grandchildren whilst our daughter in law ( a GP) is self isolating in her bedroom - she is 60% sure she has the virus. Even as a GP she has not been able to test herself despite trying for 3 days to get a test kit ...just unbelievable !!!We have also being having WhatsApp video 'coffee mornings' with friends and neighbours - strange enjoyable The BIG PROBLEM is that far too many people are not following our example ... they somehow feel that they know better than the 'experts' .... especially some of the younger generation The pictures on the TV this evening of people in London still frequenting pubs, bars and cafes etc is just selfish beyond beliefI am not being negative ... hopefully just factual - according to my contacts in the NHS along with those Consultants and Doctors that have brave enough to go public - Boris and his 'experts are hiding the truth and the facts about the readiness of the NHS. Besides the younger generation I am also having trouble with my 89 year old mother. In her mind she has survived WW2, rationing , Asian flu in 1957, Hong Kong Flu in 1968, swine fever, SARS and the financial crash without having isolate - so she and her similarly aged friends still gather for coffee mornings and afternoon tea ...again unbelievable !!! At her age I doubt I will change her mindThe Government should have been more truthful, more decisive and acted sooner on a whole number of things .... and listened to those at the coal face. It is absolutely shameful that all our NHS workers are being put at more risk than they should be - because the Government did not act quickly enough Now they have somehow got to persuade large numbers of the population to take distancing more seriouslyMust go now - the wife needs the PC to do a Rock Choir performance on You Tube !!!Edited: 4:08 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"Ha Ha Ha ------------------I am just imagining Mrs Mdp right now . Love to her and you .  I hope to see you both when this dreadful thing has died down,and I pray I am here to see it, as I pray for the future of Barbados and all it's people. It's going to be a long hard road, but the people of this Island have faith and resilience , and even now as I speak to friends on the beach every day and say "" Morning, you good "" they say, ""yes, I'm good, not earned any money for a week, but I'm good "" We Brits, Canadians, Americans, etc etc have a lot to learn from these people. Alex, I hope your job is safe . Barbados will rise again, have faith . Just thank God that we have Mia in charge now and not that evil former Prime Minister. Under him, we would now be long gone."
Well said Chris G. Mia has the advantage of seeing how other countries have tried to deal with it. Maybe what works and what doesn't. Who knows yet?
I totally agree with you Chris. Sounds just like us here.
"Barbados is clearly finished now with the coronvirus spreading throughout the Island,and without tourism ,will finally collapse into oblivion."
"Oh John Francis , if that is true then wherever are you going to be able to write your posts of doom and gloom ?  How about saying a little prayer for us instead ?"
"It’s also pretty telling about your feelings for the Island when you condemn so many lives to oblivion . Barbados must have really done something to hurt you at some time .  May your God forgive you for your feelings of revenge .Edited: 7:01 pm, March 19, 2020 "

Is this poster a clairvoyant? I hope he’s not right?
"Mdp, sounds good. Ours are getting a bit older so we can talk to them on the phone. We may use FaceTime at the weekend too. It’ll be fun and games after schools close tomorrow. Our son in law is also working from home. Our daughter recons they’ll all kill each other unless they have time apart in different rooms in the house! Our son’s family too will be climbing the walls. Better to be safe though."
"MDP some novel approaches for dealing with social distancing, will have to try them. Really feel for your family, such a worry for you, hope all is well. WhatsApp video is such a great technology we rely on it for contact with our family in Singapore, they were due home for a month in May doesn’t look likely so it will have to be WhatsApp. John Francis I hope you’re wrong and I am sure you are. What I have seen of Barbados and it’s people they are resilient and I am sure will get through these dreadful times. Why be so negative!"
"Working from home or social distancing does NOT mean you cannot go out or get away from others in the house. You can even meet with people so long as you are 2+ metres apart and not coughing or sneezing from a non Covid 19 infection We are planning a meet up with friends ..who,like us, have been social distancing for more than 7 days and are without symptoms ...roll on picnic weather!!!Isolation is necessary only if you have or suspect you have (with appropriate symptoms) Covid 19This crisis is throwing up up some odd changes to customs and practices ...Email from the golf club says we MUST putt at all times with the flag in and we no longer have to rake the bunkers !!!Edited: 9:39 pm, March 19, 2020 "
"This link gives simple instructions for self-monitoring and self-isolation. I know the guidelines are from one specific gov't but I think the definitions are universal.If we all follow the instructions we *may* get a handle on this.https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/servi…Edited: 7:19 am, March 20, 2020 "
NC - interesting ...maybe a bit complex to work out I think there is aslo some confusion around the terms distancing and isolationWe have now self distanced for 5 days ...no symptoms ...but we go out for a walk and to work at the allotment and small short shopping trips at the special older people times ..STILL keeping 2 metres away ...this is the really important measure ..avoid crowded placesIsolation is when you have symptoms of any kind or know you have been in contact with someone who has symptomsKEEP 2 m away from ANYONE outside your family unit and you should be OK7+ days for a solo person ...14 days for a family
"ON another aspect of this ....In London and other UK cities there seems to be FAR TOO MANY younger people not complying with the distance rulesIMHO ...this is for a nmber of reasons .....They generally do not watch the TV, listen to the radio or read newspapers ...they rely on 'social' mediaThey are generally the most cynical generation about 'experts' and especially politicians They are living with the concept of fake news and treat much of what they with some degree of doubt but on the other hand they are all to willing to accept what the bloggers and influencers say According to a friend who works for Facebook UK ...they were yesterday strongly criticised, for allowing too much content that was not in line with the Governments policyIn my view all Governments sould be dedicating time and effort to persuade bloggers , influencers celebrities and media 'stars' to stress to the younger generation that this is serious and going to the pub club or cafe is not a good ideaThe UK has an middle aged male 'expert ' pushing our message about self distancing ....hardly the most likely person they younger people will listen to"
"AFAIK....Isolation means removed from general public and orhers and diagnosed with a disease.Quarantine means removed from general public and others and not yet diagnosed.Self means doing either on your own, not in a facility.Many people are using the terms incorrectly including our PM. He says we are in self-isolation which isIncorrect since we have not tested positive."
Guess they haven't heard that 12% of people between 20 and 50 with the virus end up in ICU and some have died.
"NC it seems the government here is going with the approach that most people will be infected as per the PM. I do wonder if they have not seen what is happening globally. As much as they claim they can manage it I think most Bajans know our health care system cannot manage a major health crisis. In addition, Barbados has more seniors than it does young people I am just hoping this goes ok."
"NC ... in #26.. ..well said and agreed ..the UK Gov and its experts are equally confusing over the use of these critical wordsAt least Boris and co have now been firm, decisive and unequivocal ...all bars, pubs ,gyms restaurants erc will be closed as from tonightApparently research shows that 30% of people in London were ignoring the social distancing 'rules'This has been supported by a almost unbelievably massive package of economic and finacial support The bad news ( live on the TV now) ... still a big lack of testing for front line NHS workers ...frankly unbelievable"
"It is unbelievable that the UK was so unprepared and took so long to realize that the ""herd"" concept was not suitable in this case. Sir Patrick Vallance has a lot of explaining to do.https:/…"
NorthernCanuck1She addresses the nation everyday and is doing so again right now.Regards
"Mia has just finished her two and a half hour faultless speech . I do not think I have ever heard anyone so inspirational in the whole of my life .  Thank God we have her leading the Government , I shudder to think where we would be if the last Government had still been in charge . I expect you will all be able to read her plans tomorrow."
"Hello to all my Barbados friends, I’m sorry I’ve not messaged recently. I’m thinking of you all now and concerned that you stay well and look after yourselves now C19 has arrived in Barbados. I’ve been busy sorting out emergency arrangements for my staff and customers (as many of you will have been). Advice from government has been coming in very slowly and has made things stressful for all. I’m missing Barbados very much and hope very much to be back in December if all this is over by then and flights resume. For now, what matters is that you all are okay."
.#10Totally agree with you. Very erudite and sensible comments. Thank you..
https:/…pm-thanks-bajans-businesses-support
Has her speech been posted online yet?
SYNOPSIS - link above
BB ...#10 was mainly about my comments in #9 ...and I agreed with Chris in #11... now the UK Government has belatedly taken the required actionDaily Telegraph reporting today that between Monday and Wednesday ...only around 25% of the UK population was following the advice on social distancingThe pictures and videos of people in the UK and the US ignoring the advice is quite frankly frightening for those of us following the rules
"Many unwarranted personal attacks on Boris and the UK Government,when in reality,they are showing leadership in their handling of this shocking crisis afflicting the entire globe,and introducing world leading strategies to protect the economy and employees alike.Some on here are clearly living in the past,for some obscure reason, and still want to discuss Brexit , rather than moving forward !!Will be interesting to watch Mia's proposals to protect the Barbarian people in what was described on the radio this morning as potentially, the worst international challenge exceeding World Wars 1 ,2 and the 2008 banking crisis rolled into one."
Thanks for posting Canby
John Francis . “ Barbarian people “ ? I trust that is a typo ?
"Westie,Apologies,meant Barbadian people.Should be wearing glasses all the time at my age!!Stay safe,you are probably better off staying on the Island,rather than returning to what can only be described currently, as chaos."
"I agree John Francis and thank you . However I really worry about my close relatives and friends in the UK.  All I can do, is pray for them to stay in good health. I know one close relative who is over 70 has been going out and about in and around London literally until a day or two ago, a fact that disturbs me greatly.Edited: 9:51 am, March 21, 2020 "
