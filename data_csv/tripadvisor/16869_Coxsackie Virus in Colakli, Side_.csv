All explained here ...https://sputniknews.com/art_living/2...irus-epidemic/ and one post today said ... Having read the article I am wondering if this is yet another slur on Turkey particularly by the Russians. Putting people off of holidays in Turkey is easily done if you think you're definitely going to catch this disease. But I believe there are cases all over the world and has been for years and years. However tourist numbers will stay down if people have something else to be frightened of. Then in the long run it'll eventually ruin Turkish tourist trades and anything linked with it.
"We came back yesterday from Antalya! We stayed at our preferred hotel calista in Belek! Our son ( 9 months) get Coxsackie Virus 4 days after Check in! For young kids and babies it is a high risk. 400 kids in the hotel and 36 Celsius!! Don't use pools, kids club and desinficate baby chairs and so on..."

You can get sick everywhere...
"Coxsackie virus, whilst not very nice, is hand, foot and mouth and not the same as the foot and mouth disease cattle can have. I can remember having letters about it when my children where at nursery quite a few years ago, so unusual but not unheard of. And not pleasant at all to get on holiday."
"As NicyCheshire says this is an unpleasant condition, but not unusual or dangerous.https:/…_and_mouth_diseaseI think people are confusing it with foot and mouth disease which is very different and affects livestock. It is not the same. This is something that mainly affects children and breakouts in schools and other places where children congregate are not uncommon.So although unpleasant, there is no need for mass panic."

Did your son swim in the pools? Or how do you think he got infected? Thanks
Infection pick up from pool and kids pool! Most resorts use for Desinfektion only ionisator systems with very less chlorine! This is not enough! For example in Germany it is not aloud! Only chlorine is able to kill all Virus and bacteria !
"We are also in belek ABD i can confirm. Or son 18 months old got it as well. Honestly, you cannot really take the ambassador seriously. He cannot say anything else."
May be Kemer or Fethiye! If you go to belek do not go in the pools or kids pool....go on the beach and in the sea!
You could go go Cirali .
"The problem is that I've read that the virus is in belek,"
"I have read that it's also in Kemer, Alanya, Cyd, and Manavgat. Fethiyeh will be a long trip. I will not even think about getting in the pool. I won't risk it."
"Hi,We caught it in Belek (Crystal Family Resort and Spa). All three of our family (2y old daughter, husband and me). I suppose it was a light form of that virus in comparison with photos available in google. Besides we did not swim in pool!Edited: 3 years ago "
My 2 years young daughter had the same symptoms (t at its highest point was 39.8)
Go to Fethiye. Lots of accommodation and some nice resorts in that area.
We are back home now. We stayed in the old town and cancelled going to any resort anywhere. We stayed in Tuvana hotel and loved it so much. It was a different experience to stay in a small boutique hotel and also felt more comfortable for us not to risk our baby. Thank you all for your advice.
Good choice!
Also this seems to have been blown a little out of proportion. I well remember getting notices from my children's school about this virus. I think the main problem has been that unlike a school the unfortunate kids suffering from it cannot be kept at home hence the spread.So pleased you enjoyed the Tuvana. I've met several people that have paid repeat visits there. Kaleici does take some beating as a place to stay.
Yes we loved it so much. Also I feel we were lucky to read this post. My sister's friend was in Belek the same time we were in Antalya and her 18 months old daughter got infected too.
"My family are in turkey and the 11 month old babie has caught hand foot and mouth disease, soon after arriving. Ruined the whole holiday. This was hotel In manavgat side turkey. Quite a few people in hotel have the same. Very bad."
"It's not adviseable to go all inclusive. I know it can work out cheaper for families, but nothing is worth putting the health of young children at risk. There are so many good 3* hotels in Turkey doing B & B, as well as S/C apartments, and hundreds of restaurants and lokantas serving good quality, fresh food, at prices so much cheaper than in the UK. You don't know who has handled the food at the buffet style dining areas of these hotels, and it's not the fault of the staff usually."
"Yes, our 28 month old daughter got it last week at pegasos world side."
"I can never understand anyone wanting to go all inclusive in Side when there are so very many wonderful restaurants close to hand and all at reasonable prices with excellent food - some with views of the sea - others overlooking the Apollo Temple where Anthony and Cleopatra fell in love - and yet more along the harbour.Good b and b s in Side are ... 1. The Beach House Hotel which has 12 rooms overlooking the sea and in the heart of Old Town Side yet on a quiet street and with its own private beach area. 2. Sunbird Hotel which is a 10 minute walk to the beach and then a further half hour walk along the promenade into Old Town Side. 3. Sun City Hotel which is very close to Sunbird and a lot bigger of a place. 4. Hanay Suites Hotel, also in that locality, surrounded by restaurants, bars and shops. Check the prices. i think you will be pleasantly surprised. x Angela in Side x"
"I totally agree, cannot understand anyone gong A.I anywhere in Turkey Hotels are so cheap as is eating out at a different wonderful restaurant every night. Is fabulous and a real experience of Turkey."
