"We always vacation in early May, and rarely book at the same resort twice. However, we are staying at Mahekal next week and we are confident that we may have found the type of place to become ""regulars"" at. So, a good chance to be going back to PDC in May."
"May 11th for 2 weeks at the RPRM. First time to Mexico and first time AI.Can't wait. Every Sunday morning lying in bed (probably too much info) with cold grey skies reading the forum and hotel reviews.So exicted, the hotel and beach look fab. Once Xmas is out the way, pay for it in February (ouch) then proper countdown begins. It's great having this to look forward to over the winter."
Riu Palace Riviera Maya..May 15 to May 25
Plans are to book for the last week of May which is my favorite time to be in Mexico. Will be going to Grand Palladium. Most likely the Kantenah but we have not ruled out the other sections yet.
"I am glad to see that someone else is excited as I am, I am already counting days. We will be at Secrets Maroma May 4th-7th and then Excellence Riveria Cancun May 7th - 10th - a toal of 6 nights. We have been to the Mexico four times - Cozumel, EPM, Secrets Silversands, and Live Aqua. This is our first time to try two resorts on one trip. We got the idea from someone we met when we stayed at Life Aqua last May."

This is going to be such a new experience for my husband an I as we have always gone to Florida (7 times) for our family holiday. Next year it's just the two of us and apart from places in Spain and Greece we have never been anywhere apart from Florida so I have a lot of reading to do before we go.Really looking forward to our trip."
May 15th for 4 nights at EPM for us. Our first time at an AI and my first time to Mexico.
Honeymoon 6th may for 2 weeks at the epm! Can't wait so excited! X x x
Looking for June 10th for 8-9 nights in Riu Playacar or Tequila. Me and spouse.Not booked yet like Barcelo too ..
"I am at the riu yucatan but slipped over to the palace to take a look. Very fancy great if you are looking for a nicer hotel with little shops, half hour walk to Playa del carmen. Beaches are beautiful,sandy, no need for wet shoes, The resort is not so great if you are looking for nature and snorkelling, or if you are travelling with kids"
"I was their last week too when they were not open yet, but the new pics dont impress me that much, I would prefer RPRM over RPM if I go that way, I like Tequila and playacar and Yucatan layout looks more Rusty and not modern,For modern i can go to Michigan Ave in downtown Chicago and they have Tens of these discotheque types of Hotels and can be rented as low as $60 per night. I want to see something Authentic Mexican not just a modern Style.But thats just me...."
"First week of May, headed to the IB Grand !!"

We are going May 18 thru 27th. We were hoping to try a new resort this year but so far the CRT is still winning!!! I am still looking around.... Happy travels all!!!
"Last posted here in November when all excited about our first trip to Mexico and our fist time staying all inclusive....RPRM 11 May. Well happy days, time flies when youre having fun down to 14 weeks 4 days (lucky guess!!!) in fact got the letter from the travel agents asking for the balance to be paid this coming weekend. Should brighten a February Sunday especially as we are calling in the pub for a couple afterwards.Still reviewing the forums every Sunday morning to check out what's happening and make sure the hotel reviews stay positive.........sad I know.Don't want to wish my life away but bye bye January role call and bring on February another month closer."
"May 25th-June 1st. Haven't picked the place yet. Down to Playa Maya, Porta Playa, Aventura Mexicana, or maybe a late comer."

"Surfnorthwest, we might get to see you at the Grand how great for you to get to visit all them resorts sounds fantastic."
Surfnorthwest - I shared your web address with someone on Tripadvisor the other day. I gave you credit for the idea of splitting your vacation between resorts.
Just booked Secrets Maroma for 7 nights beginning May 4th.
May 8 for 14 nights at CRT with 12 members of our group.
"I'm going to ask, what I think is a really stupid question. Its -40 celcius where I live and I'm going to EDR beginning March. Why do people go to Mexico in May, June, July. I have NEVER been to Mexico so I may get my question answered then, but I am curious."
Espresso..... We travel in May because the prices drop at the beginning of May. June and July kids get out of school then and parents can travel with them or leave them with the grandparents.
"Polloman, great explanation. Makes sense! Hows the weather in May."
Have gone in May for the last 4 years and it's a good time to travel. The real HOT weather hasn't come yet but it is warm. Water temp is good and very little if any rain. Polloman
"Thanks Teresa, you guys are going to have a great time. Recheck that website in June....might see some other resorts to pair for 2014."
"The reason we go in May is spring has arrived at home and we go to Mexico for 2 weeks and know we will come home to warm weather instead of frigid -30C, if we go in the middle of the Canadian prairie winters, and we can keep our tans all summer long."
2nd time to Mexico and now hooked! May 27th for 1 week! No kid's week! Just a nice alone and peaceful time with the husband :) at the GSP. last time we stayed at the Catalonia but wanted to get closer for a 1st time visit PDC. Can't wait and counting down!
