"An update and a warning. While Turkish Airlines continues to fly to various points (eg Romania) which people have then used to fly on home, from 27th March it will fly only to:New York, Washington, Hong Kong, Addis Ababa and Moscow.I imagine these have been chosen as regional hubs of less-than-grave coronavirus risk, but we may get to a point where all flights are suspended. Please make your plans accordingly."
