"Hi just wondered how things are in lovely Madeira, we are looking to go in October,i see you have to have a covid test on arrival, do you pay for your test at the airport and if so how much does this cost, can you go to your hotel or do you wait in the airport for your results , any info greatly appreciated, thanks"
"Brunodog: This subject has already been exhaustively covered on this Forum. See the thread entitled ""COVID Test on Arrival"" (185 posts, the last on 11 August!). You'll find everything you need to know right there."
"If you change to the madeira Islands forum rather than the funchal forum, you will find more threads with information to answer to your questions."
You can make the test at Madeira airport upon arrival. The test is for free. You can go your accomodation and wait there for the test result which can take up to 12 hours (on average 8 to 9 hours).
"Many thanks, i did try and read through all the other posts but could not find my answer, much appreciated"
"Re Covid test. Just returned from Funchal yesterday. Get your test before you fly, 72 hours or less before you fly. If you haven't got all the valid paperwork for your test, you will be tested at Madeira Airport free of charge but according to those in our hotel, it is not a pleasant experience and not a good way to start your holiday. Then you have to isolate at your hotel and if one of your party tests positive you are then isolated at a separate COVID hotel where you are not allowed out of your room! So suggest you get tested before you go to ensure you're not going to spend your entire holiday in one room!"
Hi philadelphus. .. I’m still a bit confused with test or no test at Funchal Airport . So you got a test here in UK within 72 hrs of going on hols I take it . ..? So that means if you pass test you don’t get tested at Funchal ? I didn’t think that’s how it worked Cheers
Alex S: Philadelphus is correct. That IS how it works. Show proof of an appropriate negative test carried out no more than 72 hours before departure and you don't have to take the airport test in Madeira.
"Is that what you done BF ? Just wondering why others without naming names just didn’t do that then . Not taken in with your this how it works , must be more to it , like recognised body giving you the test cert or something / type of test etc .Edited: 10:53 am, August 17, 2020 "
"No, Aex, the information I gave came from the Travel Advice section on www.gov.uk, entry equirements for Madeira.As I said, the test has to be an appropriate UK test that is recognised by the Madeiran authorities. But getting it done in time to get the result back before your flight could be fraught with difficulty, egYou have an 07.40 flight on a Monday arriving Funchal about 11.30 This means you need to be tested sometime after 11.30 on the Friday. But it can take (so we read in the press) 3 days for you to get the result of the test. Doing it on the Thursday is no good because that will be out of time.Maybe Philadelphus can help us out on this."
"AlexS agreed I wish getting test 72hrs prior had have been simple as it would definitely have taken some worrying away for us. First you have to get a private test and not NHS test as government have been clear we must not use NHS testing for travel purposes. Cost £150 which although a lot agreed shouldn't be tax payer responsibility. Private test has to be correct certified organisation to be accepted and also test results must be back for a Monday flight when all private centres we found close on Sundays. We were also unclear at the time whether they would count a diyvhome test as after all no one verifies the sample was taken from correct patient, we did see something it had to be a clinic but could not find full clarification. Sadly no private clinic offering service anywhere near here so we stayed in semi lock down for 2 weeks prior to travel and took the chance of test at airport."
"ClareJ ; Good info a bit clearer now . Never thought of the semi isolating 2 weeks prior to leaving , quite a good idea that . And for the record not naming names bit was NOT referring to you Clare , but great you came up with all the info . Cheers"
"AlexS semi lock down was OK but also with 2 weeks quarantine on return, that makes 5 weeks for a week away. Was it worth it? Yes for us it was especially after the last few months and hardship others facing but we could factor it all in due to our work. Wouldn't be able to repeat however. Testing facilities in UK and results timings seems way behind some other countries. Saw on a news article that Frankfurt (I think I remember correctly) offer private testing at airport, results back 3-6 hours depending on how much you pay for your test. Heathrow are looking in to similar I believe both ways but UK government not convinced and they need to approve it first."
"type of test - it has to be a PCR test, dated and signed to be accept by the local authorities. It's clear on Visit Madeira - ""3. COVID-19 disease test - All passengers on flights from abroad, who carry a negative PCR test for COVID-19 disease, carried out within 72 hours prior to departure, in laboratories certified by national or international authorities, upon disembarkation, may proceed to their destination, upon presentation of the respective report, which can also be submitted in advance, together with the epidemiological survey, at www.madeirasafe.com;"" link http://www.visitmadeira.pt/en-gb/useful-info/corona-virus-(covid-19)/information-to-visitors-(covid-19) Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEKT2SfnXjM"
"#12 ClareJ , glad the 5 weeks was worth the 1 week , must have been a great holiday . #13 ptnov64, thanks for clear info as well ."
Bucksfizz yes but it has to be from a recognised test place or they won’t except it and I have no idea how you would know if they will accept it as could find no info on it.
"Hi Clare J, I was just wondering what the test at the airport was like? As another post describes it as not a pleasant t experience. Thank you!"
"Hi Charlotte, the test on arrival is well organised and all staff pleasant and helpful. No it is not pleasant experience but lasts a minute at most. It is the same test as in UK, swab up both nostrils and back of mouth/throat."
Thanks for your quick reply. That’s good to know.
Hi How do the airport testers get your results to you at your hotel?We are coming to Funchal in January and weighing up our optionsThanks
All the details here:http://www.visitmadeira.pt/en-gb/useful-info/corona-virus-(covid-19)/information-to-visitors-(covid-19)When you fill a simple survey at www.madeirasafe.com you have to provide a phone number and email. This is where you will get your test result.
"I'm hoping that by January the test at the airport will have been dispensed with, but who knows?"
"Jamieboy I would like to share the same thought but looking at the current scenario across Europe and the perspectives for Winter I believe that will not be the case.I am more inclined to think 1) there could be more specific testing based on country of departure and/or 2) testing will be simpler, quicker and cheaper by then."
fnc_paulo - Wishful thinking on my part lol
"Never mind January I'm hoping for end November lol . We have 2 out of 3 okay (for now ) , no quarantine on Return, direct flight yesterday just need a ""result"" of some sort on testing and we are sorted . :-)"
"The testing I could live with, it's the masks that clinch it for me."
"HO101 ...I'm okay with masks probably because i know what i'm getting myself into , whereas Testing bit there's the worry with What If we test positive . Surely the Mask enforcement be done away with or relaxed in near future ."
"HOlidaymaker101 - I could put up with the mask (though obviously not ideal) but the thought of testing positive and having to spend the 'holiday' isolated in a strange hotel room horrifies me - and you can have no symptoms whatsoever and test positive . Alex, I was pleased to see yesterday that direct flight from Scotland was operating ."
"Agree with you Jamieboy was great to see a Direct Flight from Scotland , i will monitor in months ahead .Done a mock flight booking - there's 19 seats at least left on my flight , expected that anyway ."
