"Dengue fever is now prevalent in many parts and cities/towns of Cambodia, so please do not get complacent about this very unpleasant sickness for which there is no prophylaxis or specific treatment.Please see:https:/…But there is no need to become paranoid about dengue fever either if simple common sense precautions are taken by travellers.It's some years ago now but my own daughter caught dengue fever in the Siem Reap - Angkor region in a January during the dry season, so it is far from being a ""wet season"" only problem as some post to this forum. It is also very unpleasant for both the patient and the parents.Best regards. Ian/Angkorlad"
"Hello Ian/Angkorlad,Whilst on the subject of health and wellbeing, I have an elderly English friend living in Phnom Penh that is trying to find a doctor he can trust, do you have any recommendations for a good family doctor.Many thanksRegardsRoger"
"Agree, one should be ""alert but not alarmed"" wrt Dengue Fever. As it is mosquito borne, risk is low to travellers in the dry seaosn, but there is still a risk, as you note.Best measure is a bit of DEET repellent during the day. I think the media would report any major outbreaks, though, right? That is typically the case in Thailand and elswhere.Craig."
"Hello Roger My recommendation would be British doctor, Dr Gavin Scott, BSc. MBChB, DRCOG, Dip Ven (UK) who is a general medical practitioner.Gavin was a UN Medical Officer who stayed on in Cambodia and is married to a Cambodian and has family in Phnom Penh.His consulting rooms are in one of the streets that borders the main Phnom Penh Night Market, Street 108 and the building number is # 88. Phone numbers are: Reception - 023 306 802 His HP - 012 - 898981 and 015 9121 00I bump in to Gavin from time to time at Phnom Penh exhibition openings.I hope that this helps somewhat?Best regards. Ian"

"Hi Angkorlad, I've been following your posts about Dengue Fever with great interest, thanks for keeping us updated. How awful for those affected and especially young children. I do hope the situation improves asap for their sake.I'm planning a solo trip to Vietnam, Cambodia and Northern Thailand in late October (very soon). Unfortunately, despite using DEET and following all the recommended precautions, I am always bitten and get quite severe reactions. With the 2019 outbreak of Dengue Fever, I'm seriously considering cancelling the trip. The prospect of having to douse myself in repellant, covering up in the heat and on constant alert is bringing me down tbh. I was under the impression from many posts here that a mosquito net wouldn't be required on my trip but evidently it will be. Am I mad to consider cancelling my trip or am I overreacting? Kind regards,MJ"
"Nobody can possibly answer that question for you as regards your tripYou say you always get bitten despite following all recommended precautions, and subsequently suffer quite severe reactionsThat will not change of course, but you will only get Dengue if you get bitten by a mosquito that is a Dengue carrier, and that will be a breeding femaleSo are you ready for more severe reactions is the question you have to ask yourself, and is it worth it if they are that badHappy Mosquito free Travels"
"Absolutely, you're right no one can answer this for me. My apologies. I think I just get swept up in the new reports and to hear that people are suffering, terrible.I'm really very careful about it but still get bitten with swelling, sore limbs and bruising. However, as you said, it wouldn't matter if it was a Dengue carrier or not... but the potential threat does worry me.Would you recommend taking a mozi net for stays in hostels and guesthouses grahamlake2016? Thanks again for response.Edited: 10:42 am, September 12, 2019 "
"I would say a mosquito net would be essential for you, but it cant do any harm anyway can itPersonally I normally dont have any trouble with mosquitos after residing here for many years, but my Malaysian wife is a mosquito magnet If I do get bitten I slap some saliva on it and just forget about it, dont ever scratch them because you will see some locals with scared legs especially childrenHappy Travels"
"Today's update on Dengue Fever in Cambodia.https:/…cambodia-its-bad-year-dengue-feverIf you really want to help a poor person buy them a good quality mosquito net. A good family sized net made in Thailand will only cost you $12 in almost any local market and could save a life. Yes, you can get cheaper nets but why skimp on size and quality if your aim is to help?Best regards. Ian/AngkorladPhnom Penh"
@maryjo I have never needed my own mosquito net in Cambodia and I am usually using cheap fan rooms where they are provided and occasionally cheap a/c where they have not been necessary but it does of course depend on where you are stayingthe overall risk of a traveler catching Dengue is low even though the risk is higher this year. The question you should be asking your GP is how with your medical history Dengue would affect you and are there any added risks. regardless of Dengue though you would need to take precautions against the mosquitoes
"Deaths from Dengue in S E Asia / the region have now surpassed 1,800 in 2019The majority of the deaths have occurred in the Philippines, over 1,000 so farTake all precautions necessary and dont let your guard downHappy Travels"
"I think the worst time to get bitten is around sun set. Especially if you sit in bars or restaurants, so avoid doing this.Also look out for swarms of mosquito's in rickshaws or near the road and avoid these places, or where you are standing. Check your room for mosquito's. A good idea is to spray your deet under the bed and around the room this will kill them and drive them out.Where shoes and socks instead of sandals this will help. Over all there isn't that much you can do. If i apply the deet sometimes it makes it worse and the mossies attack!Good think is i don't see that many mosquitos around here, so i depends on the area. I guess Siem Rep is a bad area for it."
the worst time could be during the day if you go in the jungle or forest but yes generally around sunset the worstIt is also worth noticing that some places seem to attract more mosquitoes than others and sometimes even moving table may help. Also as well as using chemicals one trick my host uses on the odd night when they are out in force is the fan which helps keep them away when we are sitting outside having dinner

"Many thanks for the update, Ian.We are headed that way in late December."
"Thank you Craig S for your kind feedback.It is essential that travellers be well informed but not paranoid about Dengue Fever.A well informed traveller can make decisions and take precautions that best suit their travel plans and personal ""comfort zone"".Best regards. Ian/Angkorlad"
