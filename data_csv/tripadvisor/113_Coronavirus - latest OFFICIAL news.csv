"Selfish motive as well...my trip coming up mid-May, but a bit of a labor of love as well!"
"For reference to others (please note just Google Translate so may not be perfect) here is the key point from the Decree.But more importantly people need to consider this Decree was dated 5th March where many nations not listed have seen increase in cases of over 300%. At the date of the Decree the US was at 200 cases, but is now past 1,1003. To require citizens arriving from the People's Republic of China, Republic of Korea, Italian Republic, Islamic Republic of Iran, French Republic, Federal Republic of Germany, Kingdom of Spain, as well as other states with disadvantaged the spread of new coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV) according to the list approved by the Federal Service for supervision of consumer protection and human well-being in the city of Moscow, in addition to the measures provided for in paragraph 2 of this decree, provide self-isolation at home for a period of 14 days from the date of return to Russian Federation (do not attend work, study, minimize visiting public places)."
"The issue here as I have expressed elsewhere is the phrasing: ""as well as other states with disadvantaged the spread of new coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV) according to the list approved by the Federal Service for supervision of consumer protection and human well-being in the city of Moscow"" Where, BTW, as stated to date, I have yet to find ANY such list one could THEORETICALLY refer to...and have been checking BOTH FEDERAL as well as Moscow specific sites (these are entirely different ""entities"" if you will..."
"""as well as other states with disadvantaged the spread of new coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV) ""My take on the generality of that statement is that due to the nature of exponential increase in case numbers and countries impacted, that they are reserving the right to include countries not specifically listed as at the date of the Decree.Hence I understand your frustration, and with the WHO now declaring a Pandemic, every country should be making available the simple thing you're asking for, a definitive, continually updated list of Countries which will be denied entry, or be required to self isolate.But ultimately, it is not going to help the traveler in making their decision unless they are traveling tomorrow. The situation is just too fluid, and being a Pandemic now, there is an acceptance it is no longer able to be contained.Edited: 4:31 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"#1 Thanks for the link.The information provided is in reference to the Degree dated the 5th of March, but importantly, it does clarify how it impacts travelers""Does the Decree concern citizens of other countries?The decree adopted on March 5 applies to both citizens of the Russian Federation and foreign citizens who arrive in Moscow from regions with an unfavorable epidemiological situation. If they arrive in Moscow for a period of more than 14 days, they will have to spend this period in isolation and then be able to return to normal life in the city. If the period of their stay is less than 14 days, they will still spend in isolation mode at the location the entire period that they planned to be in Moscow. And after this period, even if it lasts less than 14 days, they return to themselves.""So basically same rules for Travelers as for returning Citizens.Edited: 4:46 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"As there appears to be no international rules being applied to travel between nations, and Governments being slow to respond and update the situation, travelers turning up in Countries only to find they've just been put on the quarantine list, China now looking to tighten its border controls to stop the virus coming back in, here are some numbers that may help as I have been tracking the figure from as recently as last Friday (6/3/2020) , so here is the %age increase in cases since last Friday, and from Monday this week (also current total cases)China --- 0.45% since 06/03/2020 --- 0.11% this week (80,790)South Korea --- 27.38% since 06/03/2020 --- 5.88% this week (7,755)Japan --- 77% since 06/03/2020 --- 25.85% this week (639)Italy --- 223% since 06/03/2020 --- 55% this week (12,462)France --- 439% since 06/03/2020 --- 82% this week (2,281)Germany --- 251% since 06/03/2020 --- 71% this week (1,908)Spain --- 702% since 06/03/2020 --- 129% this week (2,262)Iran --- 156% since 06/03/2020 --- 34% this week (9,000)US --- 431% since 06/03/2020 --- 88% this week (1,109)Switzerland --- 453% since 06/03/2020 --- 84% this week (534)Norway --- 599% since 06/03/2020 --- 197% this week (533)Denmark --- 2110% since 06/03/2020 --- 452% this week (422)So what do the figures tell us? China with the the most authoritarian response has almost halted the spread.Also, where strict quarantines have been implemented a dramatic slow down in spread has been observed, South Korea down to 6% for the week, Japan dropping to 26%, Iran to 34% and even Italy to 55%.But it also shows the speed it spreads when countries don't react immediately, with Spain at 129%, and the sudden explosion of case in Denmark 452%.Germany, France, Switzerland and the US are seeing some slow down, with some restrictions being imposed, but those with more draconian restrictions are seeing the rewards.So what does it mean to the traveler? Every Government will be crunching the same numbers and coming up with the same conclusion, keeping it out is paramount, and swift quarantine measures at the slightest out break.The WHO has officially classified CONVID-19 a Pandemic which increased the alert levels for international travel.It is now up to each individual with travel plans to consider their situation and risk."

"Information shared by Member on a notification from KLM""Because of the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19), the Russian authorities have imposed new entry rules for passengers travelling to Russia.All passengers arriving in Moscow traveling from one of the following countries are required to self-quarantine for 14days: China, Korea, Italy, Iran, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, USA, UK and Norway.""The updated list would appear to align those nations suffering the greatest outbreaks, as the original Decree was dated 5th March 2020. The actions of the US to halt travel from Europe may see a similar response and with India closing its borders to all foreign travelers, and Russia's predisposition for reciprocity, if traveling from India it would be worth checking.Edited: 4:21 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"MuscoviteVT, if you refer back to #8, you will see all the nations listed as being at Risk, bar Japan and Denmark are on the updated list by KLM. I would expect to see Denmark added shortly. Point is, reporting out of all Government Agencies are latent, and travelers need to be assessing other aspects other than simply what is being published. The major issue for travelers from India is their Governments decision to close its borders to all foreign travelers. Russia is the king of reciprocity."
"While Russia may well be “the king of reciprocity”, I can assure you all that based on my constant monitoring of Russian media...including TV news and daily political discussion shows, that there is ZERO reciprocity involved here as they are NOT doing this based on diplomatic reasons, but on a very strong sense of doing all that is needed to protect their citizens, something we could learn from in the US..."
"Hi everybody,I'm flying early April Bog-Bcn-Mow (layover in BCN airport as there are no direct flights from Colombia to Russia). I don't intend to abandon the transit area, however, do you think that only bc I'm taking a flight in Spain I will be subject to the quarantine requirements?"
""" ZERO reciprocity involved here as they are NOT doing this based on diplomatic reasons, but on a very strong sense of doing all that is needed to protect their citizens, something we could learn from in the US...""The reference is to India and responses are not immediate, but Russia will take note that its citizens are being banned from entry, the response won't be instantaneous, as would look like a childish tit-for-tat, but watch this space.There is no surprise about the expanded list from Russia as agree about protecting their citizens from the outset, as opposed to the US denial, then panic bombshell ban when the horse has already bolted. The UK exclusion is odd at least. But it's not just the US that have been complacent, our government is still allowing Cruise Ships to berth whilst advising its citizens against Cruise Ship Travel, go figure!"
"Where, apart from KLM, is this expanded list?"
"Hi David,What Passport are you flying on? If the notification from KLM is correct ""All passengers arriving in Moscow traveling from one of the following countries are required to self-quarantine for 14days: China, Korea, Italy, Iran, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, USA, UK and Norway""Then travelling on a UK Passport may be just as problematic as you will have no proof you haven't been residing in the UK. Generally your Passport is the first thing Immigration look at, then for stamps for where you have recently traveled to."
"Where, apart from KLM, is this expanded list?This is the issue, information is very scarce, and other than a Decree posted the 5th of March, nothing official on any Russian Site, but as has been highlighted, the broad term 'other states showing possible “unfavorable” signs' of which there are now many.Please take note of the penalty that is being reported on numerous publications if Self Isolation is not observed.Those who return from China, South Korea, Iran, France, Germany, Italy and Spain and other states showing possible “unfavorable” signs of coronavirus should self-isolate themselves at home for 14 days,The Moscow healthcare department said on Sunday that those disregarding the regulation risked severe punishment including imprisonment of up to five years."
"Hi Eugene, Thanks for your prompt answer.I'm flying on my Colombian passport (useful as we don't need a Russian visa)It won't show I've been to any red area (I haven't left Colombia since January).Do you think I will face any quarantine? I won't have a Schengen stamp either as I'm only transiting Madrid.I've talked to the Russian Embassy in Madrid and Bogota, as well as with Aeroflot, but their responses have been surprisingly vague."
"Sounds like you're one of the lucky ones, as Columbia would not classify as ""a state showing possible signs"".As you are only transiting through Madrid your original port of departure with show as Bogota.You'd probably in the best situation, would have been even better not transiting through Madrid.You could still end up being questioned though, as your flight will be flagged as arriving from Madrid.Hopefully someone else may be able to expand on the latest arrival procedures in Moscow and whether they are identifying passengers by flight No?"
"That would be great. Yeah, I know, I thought about changing the route to fly through Cuba, but it was way too expensive, I bought my tickets early January, when all this was only happening in China.Hopefully, someone can share their experience transiting through the EU coming from non-red areas.Still, thanks for your help Eugene."
"Hi, I am about to open up another thread on ""Should I travel - by the Numbers""In short, there may be a glimmer of hope, as nations hit early and have taken immediate action are down to single digit % movements for the last 24 hours, 0% China, 2.5% South Korea, 4.8% Singapore, 3.1% Hong Kong, 7.5% Japan.Even Italy is slowing at 17.5%, when compared to Spain 27.6%, Germany 28.4%, Switzerland 24.9%, Austria 31.9% and Denmark 23.7%.The US is at 24% and the UK 22.7% and here is the issue, Ireland are at 38.6%.Tracking all the data, it appears once the virus is introduced there is a catastrophic explosion in case number, then drastic measures are taken to quarantine cities, even countries, and then there is a significant drop off in numbers.The WHO have been bleating on about the risk for months where no on listened, and here we are, but the WHO have also been surprised the way in which strict quarantines have had an effect as is being seen in China, South Korea and even Iran at 10.7% in the last 24 hours.So Ireland's current trajectory is the concern, as Ireland seems to be at the start of the cycle.7 days ago, Denmark had 20 cases, they now sit at 674, Slovenia 3, now 96.Unfortunately your fate sits in your Governments hands and if it acts fast could stop the virus in its tracks. Your isolation may be a benefit, as has helped nations like Sri Lanka.Edited: 9:39 pm, March 12, 2020 "
"7 days ago we had 15 now it's at 70 and introducing all the same bans as the who advised its seems the past week to Belgium, Netherlands, France and Russia etc.I wish they'd just offer travellers the chance to postpone flights to next year then cancel as many flights everywhere as possible at this stage. Im not sure the statistics really necessarily match efforts taken etc is it necessarily draconian measures could be down to density of population as this spike in Ireland just started Tuesday after slow increases for 2 weeks, weather conditions, people in countries initially presented in public hospitals this is now being deterred... I'm not saying you're wrong actually I'd rather more measures were in place simply put though its probably more multifaceted and I'm not an epidemiologist. Fingers crossed we all get flight money back I think at this stage kaliningrad isn't worth crossing 2 messy borders to get into/out from , but one day.Please god the ryanaer gods are smiling on me soon.

"#26...Appreciate the update, BUT I fail to see how ANY numbers from US have ANY meaning...until we begin testing at the levels of South Korea ad China, we have LITERALLY zero idea of either presence or rate of spread. If I had to guess, or bet, I would say the US has AT LEAST 100x and maybe 1,000x more cases, and is following the Italy curve...and will not follow the China curve because we cannot and will not use as draconian measures...Edited: 9:40 am, March 13, 2020 "
"#31 the point of tracking numbers is that it has been a precursor to bans and self-isolation and as many TA Members are asking about April and May, tracking the numbers gives an indication of the likelihood of a nation meeting that criteria.Totally agree about US numbers being a joke, the US haven't even tested in total what South Korea are testing in a day. The Orange Clown is now saying the US are going to do drive through Testing like South Korea without even having the required testing kits.But on more factual updates, here is the latest from the IATA site which most Airlines use as their reference pointThe latest IATA update on Russia as at the 13/03/2020 is as follows:Nationals banned from Entry are China, Hong Kong, Macao, Iran (or arriving from Iran) and Italy.Passengers who have been in China (People's Rep.), France, Germany, Korea (Rep.) or Spain and are planning to stay in Moscow must self-isolated in Moscow for a period of 14 days or for the duration of their stay if less than 14 days."
"a word about the self-isolation rule:it may apply too when the traveler gets back. Both ways, enjoy ! :)the point is that, there's a complete lack of coordination over the borders and non-enforceable rules.as a real case instance:I spend 05.03 to 11.03 in SPb. There were some reports in russian media about what countries to put on an infection-risky list, among others Norway...The irony is that I live in Norway and yesterday the norwegian government declared a state of crisis, and stated that everyone who has been travelling outside the Nordics after the 27.02 must go into self-isolation. This is my case, but then who knows if I was or not traveling and where? Fact is that work colleagues and boss knew I was in Russia, so I got a phone call from the boss earlier today telling I must sit home on 14-days paid leave. If they didn't known and I decided to not tell, then nothing.So the self-isolation rule is a double-edged knive, depending your home context: when in Russia (and many other countries now) and back home!besides in that Norway-Russia-Norway travel case, the norwegian rule of self-isolation because travel out of the Nordics is in fact silly: given that Schengen-zone countries have been all more affected than Russia, much more risky than Russia, and that all the Nordics ARE Schengen-zone, Norway too (despite not EU). Helsinki airport, Vantaa, has a quite cramped Schengen zone area, corridors are narrow, waiting areas near boarding gates too, and of course at boarding time and inside the plane it's totally cramped. So there was much more risk for me to get contaminated in Vantaa than in Pulkovo. I did a Pulkovo-Vantaa-Gardermoen route where in fact the potential problematic node is Vantaa, simply because it's Schengen. Yet as per the idiotic norwegian gov., if i had been only Finland ie. Nordics, I wouldn't have to stay in self-isolation.the whole silliness tells at something: governements in all western Europe having been incautious, uncoordinated and driving in the dark without headlights.. this epidemic started in december in China* Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan have long land borders with China, and two important near border cities: Khabarovsk, Vladivostok. Besides Moscow airports are important hubs for traffic China-Schengen. These three countries took drastic measures in january in order to avoid propagation from neighbouring China. And it worked.* somehow, the virus found his way to Italy, but NOT via the natural surface ""Marco Polo"" route through the steppes, because russian, kazakhs, mongols did seal as much as possible the way. Otherwise these areas would all been quite affected by now, which is not the case, epicenter is in Marco Polo home land* then, for a month the virus has been at work in Italy, with all Schengen countries knowing well about its potential effects, known already from the chinese case and great warnings from WHO.Yet what? nothing, people have been moving around inside all that Schengen silliness. Norwegians who were on mid-winter holidays in the Alps, Venezia, Milano, Torino, Tecino, have come back infected and Norway is by now the most infected country per population ratio after South Korea.-----the bottom line:we can know nothing because in the first place at the top the leaders are in state of stupor. As for russian government they are probably puzzled by the idiocy from the Schengen side, and trying to make their mind relatively to this. And because being so much in the dark, also relatively to possible aftermath relapses, the best is to cancel plans, swallow the losses, not make plans until autumn,Edited: 12:16 am, March 14, 2020 "
"#32...agree that tracking numbers as a pre-cursor is important, but at least in the US with our “dear leader” these are, again, meaningless, and I only meant to say repeating them only re-inforces the false narrative.

"With COVID-19 numbers continuing to grow in Europe with little sign of abating, watching the laughable position of the UK with their 'Herd' mentality strategy finally coming to their senses, although not banning, but encouraging citizen to stop all non-essential travel, the disaster of a response by the US that has them on a trajectory to be the next Italy, Russia had no option other than to close its borders and protect itself whilst its number of cases sits at 63.Having seen what has happened in the US and UK, where complacency has been their undoing and are now forced into draconian restrictions of movement and assembly, Russia has heeded the warning and acted swiftly, as has New Zealand, Australia blinked."
"> whilst its number of cases sits at 63.Just to be precise, it's 93 and counting"
"And to be even clearer, this is DIAGNOSED cases...as in, after testing some 250,000...so, any reason to think this is different than the US where we likely have 100-1000X more actually infected???"
"> testing some 250,000Officially, 109,939 tests were performed (https://www.rosminzdrav.ru/ministry/covid19). But all those quarantined in hospitals even without symptoms are tested three times during their two-week quarantine."

"> whilst its number of cases sits at 63.>Just to be precise, it's 93 and countingWas 63 at the beginning of the day at the time posting, and yes it is 93 now with 30 new cases for the day, but the figure will never be the same as it is continually changing.The precise point is that Russia have acted a lot swifter than the US or UK who didn't close their borders until they were in the 1,000s, the UK still only advising against non-essential travel. At least Russia has given itself a fighting chance to contain it."
"Again, folks...these numbers are like the US...results of TESTING, which, again while Russia is ahead of the US, the are NOT at the levels of say South Korea, which appears to have both the best testing, but also actions and results...And again, a few in Russia are (IMHO) foolishly being a bit smug about lower numbers and lack of deaths, but fortunately, their LEADERSHIP is not...and sealing their borders may well avert a larger outbreak..."

"FYI, in a related matter, I just had my Russia visa application and passport returned to me without a visa attached because they are not processing visa applications in the Houston consulate due to the corona virus. They DID, however, keep my entire $321 application and processing fee, telling me if I want to resubmit my application at a later date I'll have to pay another $321! Apparently, though the consulate wasn't available to process my visa, they were available to bank the visa application fee!My application was being processed by Artionis, the new company contracted by the Russian government to process their visa application requests under the name Russia Visa Application Centre. I'd strongly suggest you DON'T APPLY FOR A RUSSIAN VISA until we arrive at whatever the ""new normal"" is..."
"This seems very odd...in many years of interacting with Russian Consulates, i have always found them to be scrupulously honest in such cases. DC consulate also closed for this. Odd the visa processing agency because just in the last several years most Consulates in the US shifted to one used globally (used to be ILS, switched to VFS Global)...How did you pay? By chance did they accept credit card? IF they did, urge you to protest the charge. If via check, or debit to bank account, I would still suggest sending them a VERY strongly worded letter DEMANDING they return your money since while they may say this was “force majeur”, it clearly was NOT your fault. I HAVE seen where if a visa is denied, they will not return the processing fee..."
"VFS Global, who replaced ILS, has now been replaced by Artionis as of six weeks ago as the official handler of Russian visa applications in the US. Their website, linked through the official Russian embassy website, is a disaster and appears to be remnants of the earlier VFS Global and ILS websites. Nothing is clear, from pricing to application procedures. It took several weeks through calls and emails to collect enough information to submit the application. They required a money order or cashiers check. Apparently my passport and fees made it to the Russian consulate in Houston, as my passport is stamped with two dates in Russian: received March 9; returned March 18, without a visa. There was no written explanation with my returned passport as to why I hadn’t received a visa. The previous day I received a phone call from “Tatiana” from the Russia Visa Application Centre-Houston (Artionis) that visas weren’t being processed due to the virus but they were keeping my entire $321, including the Russian fee of $160 for the multi-entry visa. When I asked how the consulate could keep the fee when they were unable to process the visa, she just said all fees were non-refundable. When I pointed out fees were only non refundable if the application was denied or granted, she said it didn’t matter, it was out of their hands because of the virus.I plan to contact the consulate in Houston and formally demand a refund (or the visa) from this flighty company but hold out little hope. The entire process has been maddening. I’ve gotten visas from countries throughout the world, including some tricky places like Vietnam, Bolivia and Tanzania, but this experience has been the worst by far. I wanted to warn others to understand this apparent ripoff scam."
#59 @RunningboyI resume they are not issuing visas until the pandemic is over.Of course you deserve and explanation but not the handling fee or visa application fee - as the matter was handled and the visa applied for. Everyone who has travels planned is losing money so join the club
"Wow...thanks for update. AMAZING that they AGAIN switched...the last time was a disaster as well. As for of course they get to keep your money, at least in the US, folks generally do not willingly pay for services NOT rendered...and while MAYBE the visa processing center had some expenses, (open envelope, stamp date received, etc) there is NO WAY the Consular fees should apply.While maybe a lost cause, assume this “company” is still a company operating in the US...that is, has separate books if you will, and as such, would report them to the BBB...not like they care a whole lot, but can’t hurt."
"Thanks for your feedback. The main reason I’m posting is to hopefully prevent others from throwing away money applying for Russian visas now, as this disreputable company, acting as a contractor for the Russian government, will simply bank your application fees and return your passport without a visa. I’ll attempt to recover what I can, and will report them to the Better Business Bureau.As for Peter C’s remarks: of course many people, including me, will lose substantial money due to the corona virus. But I don’t expect fraud to be part of the losses. I applied for a multi visit three year visa. If the consulate had issued the visa, I could have entered Russia at any time after this crisis has passed. My trip wasn’t due to start until June. They had my passport at the consulate for nine days without action. I asked them to hold my application until it could be processed. They said it wasn’t an option.It’s understood that the processing fee is non-refundable whether the visa is approved or denied, but not when it isn’t processed. If the bloated $161 processing fees were kept, I could almost understand. But the consulate kept the visa fee of $160 without approving or denying the application. I’ve paid for and received dozens of visas around the world and never been ripped off like this...These are difficult times for everyone. Hopefully this is an exception as to how people will treat others as we sort things out. Safe travels to you all."
"HUGE thanks to you for this follow up...again, while I understand some of the force majeure stuff, have in the past (have a lot of dealings with them due to wife and stepson being Russian) has been that the CONSULATE has been scrupulously honest about returning money...I have a vague feeling that this is MUCH more of an issue of the AGENCY deciding to pocket money which is NOT theirs to keep. Maybe you said you did this, but aside from BBB, for sure send the Consulate a letter or e-mail...and for sure say “this behavior will likely influence my decision as to where to spend my travel $ in the future. My 3 year visa expires at end of August, and am tempted to try a private agency...though as I always warn folks, even THESE folks end up “submitting” your stuff thru the same “designated agent” (in a sack with others)..."
"Aside from the usual questions about ""since Russia is a dictatorship, maybe they are hiding something"", this is not a bad overview of where things stand...And, again, from my ongoing monitoring of Russian media, they indeed continue to treat this VERY seriously, and are as in the West combating a LOT of fake scare stories, and also aggressively combatting instances of profiteeringhttps:/…index.html"

"Yes, I think the World is taking this very seriously now with Russia now past 300, the US going past 25,000, no respite in Italy and Spain now worsening. Countries like Switzerland that seemed asleep at the wheel have been caught out horribly.Where this first broke out in China and neighbors Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan offer a glimmer of hope, but theses are very structured societies, along with Singapore, where there is a greater acceptance of the rules, and if you don't the consequences are quite brutal.Stark contrast to what is being seen in the US and Spring Break Hot Spots, along with European tourists being deported from holiday destinations for ignoring Self Isolation requirements.Western societies need to wake up and look to Asia in what it takes to beat this thing. The Governments and Health agencies are making all the right noises, but it needs their citizens to abide by the direction being given.Edited: 4:30 pm, March 21, 2020 "

Do you think Russia Consulate will waive the future visa fees for those who are affected by the COVID-19? Eg those applied and approved for a visa but couldn’t make it to the trip because of the border closure.
"What any of us think doesn't matter,what the government says does. Ask the Consulate."
"Consulates are either closed or not dealing with things like this, but seriously, would NOT count on getting a new visa for free...or even maybe waiving just the Consular fees (vs. “processing”)...IMHO"

Our passports run out mid July 2020 and unable to renew them because of passport office on shut down
We are on a cruise to Russia at the end of May 2020 but our passports run out mid July can we still travel to Russia with less than 6 months left on our passports we are unable to renew them because of coronavirus
"The issue is what your visa says? They WILL NOT issue visas for any period which is less than 6 months...assuming they even start issuing again in the next 3-4 months...But, anyway are you saying you still expect a cruise to take place end of May? IF you do, and if it does, no way will Russia allow you into port by that time...so, in this case, the visa question is moot anyway..."
">We are on a cruise to Russia at the end of May 2020<As the situation with COVID is changing from day to day the St.Petersburg Passenger Port officials recommend checking a schedule of ships (https://www.portspb.ru/en). At the moment the number of ship calls scheduled in May is 29, but I'm rather sceptical about this. We have to wait."
"It will be some time until Global Travel returns to any form of normality, you won't be seeing it before the end of the year unless a vaccine is miraculously discovered before then. The US like a freight train is steaming towards 1/2m cases, the UK no better, most of Europe struggling with Norway being one of the few in Europe looking to return to some normality internally. And that is the big thing, as nations get the virus under control they're going to keep the doors to the nation firmly closed to keep it from crossing the borders. This will be the way until a vaccine is found, every nation is solely focused on it's own citizens and reinstating their freedom of movement and kick starting their local economy.Everyone across the Globe now understands how dangerous this virus is, and how quickly it spreads.Don't expect to travel overseas anytime soon, look for options at home."
My Russia tour was cancelled by the travel agency due to Covid. We are planning to visit Russia on our own ( not doing a tour) after covid is over. Some of us have the 3 years multi entry visa. Do we need New invitation letters ( I assume the old ones from the previous tour is not valid anymore) from hotels? Does Russia custom ask to see invitation letters? Or the visa itself is sufficient?Thank you in advance!
"Your 3 year visa is valid til the printed date...period. No, you need no other documentation..."
I applied for a 3 yr visa back in January and received it in February. However since my US passport was expiring in April 2021 they made the visa expire 6 months before expiration (October 2020). So now with the Covid-19 situation it looks as if there is no way we will be able to make our visit to Russia before our visa expires. Is there any chance the Russian government may extend the term of this visa assuming we renew our US passports this summer? I cannot see spending another $300 for a new visa after the pandemic subsides.
"I follow Russian news, and there HAS been some talk of this, BUT, so far seems aimed at shorter-term, single entry visas that were for entry during the crisis,...i.e. from when Russia shut down end of March thru, well, whenever...stay tuned..."
@TonyskoMost visas (not America but definitely russia) are tied to the passport and never extend beyond the expiry of the passport. So even if they extend visas for a year your's would not be usable with your new passport.
Good catch on the passport angle...sorry missed that!!!
I'm travelling to Russia for Euro 2020 with all hotels booked. Although the tournament has shifted to 2021 does anyone know if the Fan ID visa free travel is still valid as we fly out at the end of May?
"Only official sources could say, and this would be on their web site...but based on past “behavior”, seems they would, though all depends on how the world is with regard to coronavirus ... if a second wave (likely, IMHO) and no good vaccine, then highly unlikely Russia, which closed it borders relatively early (after they saw their first few cases) would encourage an inflow of potentially infected folks...ALL IMHO..."
I am pretty confident that the FanID (as in visa free travel) is a requirement of the games being held in the host country.
