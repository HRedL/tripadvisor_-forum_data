"While everyone is freaking out about COVID-19, there are a million other ways to get sick or die."
Yes. But usually not in such large numbers or from something so communicable to others.
This article from the New England Journal of Medicine should help you understand.https:/…NEJMp2003762
"One of the problems is how quickly it spreads - already 1 in every 41 people in New York City has had it in just the last few months. Also, it appears to be very deadly for older and more vulnerable people. Another problem is that there is a high percentage of folks who are asymptomatic and are spreading the virus without knowing it.Edited: 10:49 am, May 28, 2020 "
"""freaking out"" alone is never beneficial or helpful, if you take no action.Following recommended guidelines in the face of world-wide pandemic hopefully is. Just because everyone is going to die someday from something... doesn't really have anything to do with attempting to keep covid managed and illness and deaths in smaller numbers."
"I have never freaked out over Covid-19, but I do give it a healthy respect. The virus not only attacks the lungs but reports now indicate some patients showing damage to kidneys, blood clots and the list goes on. Sure, we're all going to die from something, but why throw caution to the wind and perhaps hasten the inevitable."
"@Brid, Hope they're both OK now with no lingering effects."
I'm all about the golden middle way. No need to be a freaking out hysteric but also not an ignorant git who doesn't change their ways at all.
"""reports now indicate some patients showing damage to kidneys, blood clots "" and the rest.Before it attacks the lungs there is multiple organ damage and they don't know why or how to control it. And that's people with huge experience.Only the worst of other stuff that kills you does that. Survival can mean you are permantly damaged.The amount of freaking out depends on how much you value your life, the lives of your parents, children, friends because it can be caught in a breath.Yet you can be safe by keeping 8ft away from others and disinfecting your hands. So simple. So many reluctant to do that small thing."
"HiNo certainly not freaking out about itHowever, as others have said this virus needs to be treated with a lot of respect as it has very few boundaries and can be deadly. Unlike many other diseases that can be avoided through living a healthy lifestyle this virus does not really care what age you are or how fit you are so it is much more difficult to avoid which is why we need to take care but still wherever possible get n with life"
“ there are a million other ways to get sick or die.”But 99 percent of them are not going to happen from being next to someone who is infected. Nor do they overwhelm hospitals and healthcare workers.
My hope is to die of old age. Not catching a virus in a pandemic.
"I am not freaking out about it. I am following the medical recommendations, and staying home. Treating a problem with the respect it deserves is not freaking out. Just as I turn off power before working on electrical circuits. I am not scared of electricity but recognize the dangers and know how to work with it safely."
"I'm following Ariel and Toopaz with their posts. Don't need hysterics, but don't be stupid about it, either. Keep your distance and keep sanitizing. Even that is within reason. We want to kill the virus, not every germ (including 'friendly' ones) otherwise something else may take over.PS, It helps to live somewhere where it's fairly well accepted. Not being a smart alec, just appreciating my own circumstances.)Edited: 9:15 pm, May 28, 2020 "
"Not freaking out at all, just taking precautions reasonable to the risk. People make enormous lifestyle changes to stave off other health threats: stroke, diabetes, heart attack. Or sometimes they don't, and they suffer with those things anyway. The difference is, my grandfather's heart attacks and my father's stroke weren't contagious."
"I live in an area that you would call a very warm spot near some hot spots in Toronto, therefore for a Canadian I am kinda living in a very risky zone. It doesn't change my actions from a few weeks ago, as we have been sheilding anyway. I am angry at the rich areas in Toronto who complain and want their nannies and housekeepers and restaurants. The reason hot spots are hotter is due to bad transit and lower incomes and employment also due to bad transiit."
"I don't see much freaking out here where I live but I do see people taking precautions. We are constantly hearing ""we don't know or we are not sure"", ""we are learning so and so about the virus"" and this is from people who have spent their whole lives studying germs / diseases. That tells me we better take some precautions, simple things to reduce your chances of catching it.I'm not young but I would like to live a while longer, I would also hate to pass it on to anyone because I was careless and ignored experts warnings."
"Like Ariel, I am somewhere in the middle. We are very lucky here in Australia, and I think the chances of catching it are minimal.I am still very much looking forward to travelling to Europe again, the sooner the better, but we will be very, very careful. We aren't old, but we aren't young either. I am more frightened about catching it and passing it to my mother who has major lung conditions."
"I can't do much about heart attacks, strokes or cancer. The fact that the science about this virus is so elusive that even with so many medics and so many subjects they haven't been able to sort something out shows just how unusual this is.What amazes me is people who say I'm fit so I'm ok.......they don;t see others and think ' they may be contageous'. I guess that shows just how self absorbed society has come ot be.Edited: 8:24 am, May 29, 2020 "
"""freakin out""Did that many a time watching rock bands when I was 18If I did it now it would take me a week to get out of bed"
"Very little freaks me out! When it comes to COVID-19, I'm cautious. I've literally had less than 10 people in my personal space in the last 3 months.I'm extra careful if I need to be in contact with people I don't know to be equally cautious.I always wear a mask.I know people who are virulently anti-mask.They freak me out, not because of the virus but because of their backwards politics."
"Yes the 'backwards politics' and ""I demand my freedom"" people scare me more than covid-19 does!"
"I'm not saying you shouldn't heed the advice and or restrictions by the government but some people are freaking out on both sides of the coin. You got the people who refuse to wear masks when required and then you have the people who cross the street to avoid walking past another pedestrian who has a mask on. Howeverb I agree or depends on where you are. In my town, we have less than 3000 cases for 2 million people which I'm thankful for."
"{then you have the people who cross the street to avoid walking past another pedestrian who has a mask on}I guess I don't consider that ""freaking out"". It's pretty much standard procedure in Seattle neighborhoods right now."
I find more freaking out by those who refuse to wear a mask. If a store just dares to ask them to put one on they totally lose their mind. Talk about hysterics.
"@ Mike, thanks for sharing that story I hadn't heard of that. So happy they both are well:)"
"The only freaking out that I have seen is the crybabies that want a haircut. They also freak out when someone (like Costco) tells them to wear a mask. Funny thing, here in the Philippines, their president said we will relax our quarantine somewhat, next week. Most of the comments I see online are negative... as in against relaxing. Most people say it is too early. Asians countries are handling this a lot differently than most Western countries. (and our infection rate is much lower because of it)."
"I took ""freaking out"" to be short hand for ""taking seriously and taking serious measures"" not panicking.As I, and others on this thread have pointed out, heart attacks aren't contagious."

I think you will find that many of us have not wasted our lifeYour dad must have been very lucky to wake up after a heart attack and have no after effects
spammy spammer could have left this one at the bottom :( But I guess J&D need something to do today.
I don't think much of anything is worth freaking out about. But then I tend to be pretty calm. Of course we need to educate ourselves about covid 19 and any other virus that comes along and know how to protect ourselves and when we should seek medical attention. But to freak out? Why? That won't get you anywhere.
"“Freaking Out?”No, though some days, a bit of depression DOES creep in - especially when I am doing travel Reviews, and knowing that so much has changed.Stay safe,Hunt"
"IJ&DI fully agree that many families will have gained from either being in lockdown, working from home and / or not being able to travelMany businesses have diversified because of eventsHowever, many people have suffered because of the pandemic and it is those I feel very sorry for"

"J&D #46,Yes, time, and situations, have changed my mind on several things.I try to keep an open mind, and reevaluate my stand, as things change.Hunt"
"My opinion has not changed. Here is my original answer, from May. I still agree with it completely.--I am not freaking out about it. I am following the medical recommendations, and staying home. Treating a problem with the respect it deserves is not freaking out.Just as I turn off power before working on electrical circuits. I am not scared of electricity but recognize the dangers and know how to work with it safely.--"
"No, it's not worth freaking out about, but I think I was freaking out about it when this thread began. Back then, I didn't want to go to the grocery store without my husband. We didn't go all that often, and it was such a relief when we were finished.Also, going to the salon and the dentist back in June made me very anxious.I resumed doing Meals on Wheels in the beginning of June. On one of the first days, I remember sitting in an apartment building parking lot in tears overwhelmed with the mask, plastic gloves, and the thought of being in virus-infected spaces. My attitude has changed a lot. I'm careful, follow the rules, but not frightened like before. I'm purposely trying not to always turn on the TV like I did before."
"Its not worth freaking out about. We do stay vacations, occasional week-end travel, and enjoy life. Yes, some mornings I now wake up and it takes a bit to think of what I want to do now. Usually we're out traveling enough a down day at home is something to look forward to. This year there are more down days.In terms of minor inconveniences like wearing a mask or the occasional temperature check at an outdoor restaurant is fine.The things I miss are: 1) Dim Sum - Its great to go with friends and off the list thigs year.2) Movies - I loved going to movies and except for drive-ins showing decades old movies, they are closed.3) My planned travels this year to Alaska, Mexico, a Family Reunion.But freaking out about it no. I do get tired of it being the first thing on the news - so just avoid watching much of the news and as such out of sight, out of mind.Stay healthy."
"I think most intelligent people have realised that it isn't after all the Doomsday plague to end the human race as touted by the media. There won't be a vaccine for a long time, if ever, and you have to resume daily life whilst accepting your own level of risk. My own take is that I will probably catch it at some point, hopefully be asymptomatic but if not then no worse than flu. There's a very small chance I might get very ill or die, but then that's true of many other diseases."
"Very much agree with Post #52We have never freaked out about it but rather have listened to the advice given form day one and done our best to observe what has been recommendedJust getting on with the new normal and feel very lucky to be i the situation we are in as there are loads of people who are no where near as fortunateEdited: 10:28 am, August 18, 2020 "
"Yes, “adaptability,” BOS “freaking out,” is the catch phrase for us.Hunt"
"J&DYou need to take into account that in many countries lock downs were in place and the advise was not to travelPlease feel free to find some quotes where people were FREAKING OUT""Now you're going out and there's exactly the same chance of getting that disease as before.""Wrong as the infection rates are now very different to what they were several months ago""In 3 months no one will even care""I hope you are right but sadly I think you will not be"
"Nobody here is “freaking out“ for sure. We currently have 2 cases in this province and we have worked hard at hand washing, social distancing, using masks etc to keep cases low. Because of that everything has opened up again and we are able to take walks, eat at restaurants, shop almost as normal, have a vacation and do one day road trips whenever we want. There are NO festivals, concerts or large gatherings. And our provincial border remains closed except to those from the Atlantic provinces (where Covid 19 is similarly low). Those arriving from other areas must have permission to come into the province, and then must isolate for 2 weeks. My cousin and spouse from Florida were one of those needing permission (they had to help my elderly aunt return to NL) and they isolated, and were randomly visited by an RCMP officer to ensure they were keeping their quarantine.Most people here have taken public health rules and advisories very seriously and it shows in our infection rate. We are all worried about the reopening of schools in September; social distancing and masking rules within the schools are being finalized."
"Freaking out for sure, we have been shut down for 6 months. I lost 93% of business in April and May, slowly climb back to 25%, 28%, now 33%. Freaking Out! Give my life back!"
Sorry to hear that MacHopefully business will continue to pick up but it will no doubt take a lot of time to get back to normal

"J & D,XXXXX. editOh, I don't think I will waste my breath (typing finger)"
"Yarramar, hahaha. That is my highlight for today ""breath/typing finger""!"
"Different story in Northern California, everybody wears a mask, at work, in stores and on the street. It’s not hard at all, no discomfort, pretty simple elementary stuff for mutual respect and greater good of the society. If one counts the hours wearing mask or face shield, it is infinitely small amount of time. I wouldn’t even call that a sacrifice. Rarely in my long life I was called upon by my government to do something, this is it, gladly do my part."
Good for you J&DSadly many in the USA and other parts of the world have not been so lucky and are no longer with us
"What I find odd is you are today saying or starting to say what I said back in March, Back in March you called me silly, foolish, and other things simply because I was doing what you all are now doing. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------J&D back in March you said absolutely nothing except being worried about points, leaderboards, insulting some members and posting on year old threads. So please don't make us stupid."
"The only post worth of note is the one on Pittsburg forum...and nobody said anything to you or laughed or called you silly. Imagination, but again you like Beatles.The idea is to stop the Virus. If people would just follow basic common sense, If people continue to gather in large groups the Governor will be forced to close more business , If the irresponsible people continue to ignore the health issue. Just only go out if you definitely have to. Don't hoard items, others may need. Do some drive-up restaurants and order on Apps if possible,order online. This is a good time to visit eBay,Amazon,Bonanza and all dept store web sites."
"Well, it looks like we will travel, in two days.With United’s abbreviated schedules, we have to work, to get to the Smoky Mountains, but think we have it all planned out.Unlikely we will have a snack, or wine, on our flighTS between PHX and ORD, but will find out.Have our travel masks ready, and hand sanitizer, so will play it by ear.Stay safe,Hunt"
Hunt- do you enjoy the wine they serve on United? I do not.
"Hunt, Have a safe and fun trip. I'll wave when I see your plane heading for O'Hare!"
"It looks like we are up for some travel. We went to Boracay, Philippines a couple weeks ago (from Iloilo, only a 7 hour bus ride). And the other day, while looking for a new apartment in Iloilo city, my wife accidentally found one in Boracay.We are moving to the island in 2 weeks. Should be fun."
"Hunt, You can buy hazmat suits online for flying. I googled it after I saw a 8/11 picture of Singapore airport waiting room where everybody was wearing hazmat suits, you can buy them online. Always white color, do they have colorful happy day hazmat suits? If it comes in many colors, may look more happy and pleasant. You can make wearing hazmat suits trendy and fun."
"This reminds of laptops. I once asked a friend working at HP why don’t you make laptops in multiple beautiful colors? She is an engineer, she was totally confused, why do you want laptops in colors? Gray or black is fine. Your clothes are not just black or gray, cars are not just black, everything come in many color choices. But for engineers, they absolutely cannot comprehend that, computer has no color, period."
"My HP friends and other Silicon Valley tech friends thought my computers in colors was crazy, one year later Apple released the colorful iMac computers, Steve Jobs is a Genius! Nobody ever thought about colors! I didn’t think my colorful laptop idea was genius, it was a very basic elementary market technic, colors. Even kids knew that. Engineers don’t think that way."
They should though.Why are TV's always black? That doesn't look good for many living rooms. You used to be at least able to get white and even pink.There's room for someone to invent a way of getting an overlay so you could colour match.
"Toopaz, The latest TV's can roll away or turn into artwork. You can also have a fire going if you have it at fireplace height. And if you don't want to see anything there is this one https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/03/13/samsun…"
