Starting June 12 open take-out adult drinking will be legal on the Boardwalk and Gardner’s Basin.https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2020/06/drink…
there will no doubt be many who will be surprised that it wasn't actually legal before.
So true. Same with the beach. Over many years I've only seen limited enforcement during events that attracted many who did not know to never be clearly obvious.
Great idea! Although we have been doing there for many years....look forward to an August trip!
About time!
Never had a problem before with a little bit of discretion but nice that it will be legal now.
It says that it's only temporary???
Nothing is forever.
Most things being permitted right now are temporary. You're not going to see bars allow takeout cocktails in cups and restaurants setting up tables in parking lots prohibiting indoor seating forever. AC will use this opportunity to make this particular rule stick though. North Wildwood may consider the same thing.
