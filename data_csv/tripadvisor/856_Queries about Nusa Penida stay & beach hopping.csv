We are thinking of Having 3 nights stay in Nusa Penida instead of just daytrips from Bali....We would love to have some quality time on picture perfect beaches like Diamond beach Atuh BeachKelingking beachBroken BeachAngels billabong Peguyangan WaterfallSuwehan Beach..Just reviews about scary hike to Kelingking beach & Diamond beach .....Is the hike to both diamond and Kelingking beach can be doable without any risk ? & Which are the great view hotel/ resorts to stay in Nusa Penida nearer to the attraction places I mentioned ? Whats the cost for Moped rent per day & car with driver rent per day ?
When have you planned to do this trip?

"Diamond Beach has a decent looking set of stairs all the way down (I didn't actually go down, was too lazy that day). Atuh Beach (on the other side of the outcrop also has stairs. Kelingking is paved along the top but the path down to the actual beach is pretty hardcore towards the bottom - steep, sandy and slippery. It's also very narrow. Absolutely no chance of social distancing from the other tourists huffing and puffing all around you."
Currently the advice is that Bali will not open to overseas travellers till October and there will be specific requirements for entering Bali (Indonesia). All travel advice is changing on a regular basis. In Australia we will be guided by our own governmentâ€™s advice. A 14 day quarantine period on arrival home may be required.
"We had 4 days in Nusa Penida in January and loved it. Crystal Beach (which you didn't mention) seemed to be the most accessible as in not having to do a half a day climb to get there. We rode around the island on a scooter but had to beware of loads of vehicles ferrying Chinese tourists, who only turn up for the day, spent no money locally and leave again. Hopefully Bali will be clamping down on that type of travel in future.There are not many large resorts as such, but lots of places with 3 or 4 rooms and a pool. We stayed at Govardhan Bungalows - totally recommend. We hired a scooter for 70,000 rupiah per day - but you may have to pay more now - fallout from CV.We can't wait to get back when the coast is clear."
"Don't worry if you wanna hike down and hike up to both Diamond and Kelingking Beach. The pathway is okay, you supposed to have enough energy to do it :) bring a bottled of waters and snacks if you need that.I recommend you to stay at La Roja Bungalows. You can check their rates by Traveloka or TiketCom app.You can also ask the receptionist about price of rent a car per day."
