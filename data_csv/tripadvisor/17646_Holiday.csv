Is palm courts going to ne open during the month of may
"Think we need a crystal ball for that question Eleanor, but my guess would be no."
Hi!It's far too early to know how long the State of Alarm will continue. I believe that 15 days is the maximum that the PM can impose without getting approval from parliament.
"Why not ask the Palm Courts, though i would be amazed if they could give you an answer either way at this time"
The general consensus from Benidorm residents is that Benidorm will be closed the rest of the year. Steve
"Hi. I’m due to travel in June mid. I know it’s difficult to predict. But do you really believe Benidorm is likely to be shut or ineffective for the rest of the year 2020? My Vueling flight and AirBNB is prepaid and even under the revised terms being offered, we man not be entitled to full refunds."
No-one knows but this sitation is not going to be over any time soon.
My prediction based on the evidence of China would be June at the earliest. If this does not happen will be May 2021.
June is predicted to be the peak of the epidemic here so that month would surprise me. Over 70’s and the more vulnerable should still be isolating by then. I’m convinced my Sept holiday won’t be happening.Jules
"I’d be surprised if they’d be any holiday travel for many many months. Countries will want to stabilise their own infection rates, see it decline, stabilise to near nil before allowing international travel. It may be a case of watching the world as a whole to see that cases have decline to near zero. This may be many many months. No country will want to let in tourists who may reinfect. No one knows what may happen next winter. I am mentally prepared for no travel this year.Just my take on things which may be very wrong.Edited: 3:41 pm, March 17, 2020 "
Tebo how did you all arrive at this general concensus of benidorm residents you can't have asked everyone?Atb steve
"I suspect we'll be in the same boat as you Jules. We have 3 weeks booked in September to celebrate my 70th birthday and don't expect it to happen. Think we'll be lucky to make our January one. This is going to be long hard slog. Sad times but at least we've still got roof over our heads, which is more than many businesses in Spain and other countries will have soon. Not to mention our health. Holidays seem suddenly less important."
"#11. True, nicely said."
