"Has anyone any idea why there are so many flies in the resort at the moment. Have spoke to a number of ex-pats who have lived in Tenerife for 20+ years and they have never experienced what is happening just now. Suggestions put forward - Recent Tenerife rain, strange Atlantic weather patterns,or maybe inferior disinfectants used on rubbish sites. So is there anybody with any more enlightenment on the subject, as eating out is not the most pleasurable past-time at the moment."
"It seems its occurring in other areas too.Personal opinion ....i think it must be down to weather conditions ,a lot of winds and humidity this year .Think they have always burnt the rubbish as such and if ""inferior"" disinfectants should be the cause ,they have used these for years so why now? To add ,where i live on the East Coast UK we had this occur to during the summer months ,never ever seen this before in such vast numbers !!!"
"No idea, what is causing them but it must now be nearly 4 weeks since we stated noticing hundreds of the damned things. They are right across the island, friends in Puerto, Los Gigantes and the Golf all say they have never seen so many. Supermarkets have run out of flyspray. Maybe they are attracted by the pantomime as OH and I go on a 'big game hunt' with our swats. You would think those that escape would warn their mates as we are now crack shots. 8)http://redqueenmusings.wordpress.com"
"Just back from a two week holiday, the first week wasnt too bad but last week they were a real PITA! One resident said it sometimes happens around the season changes....spring/summer......summer/winter.Lets hope it doesnt last too long for those there!"
"Probably more to do with rubbish not being collected regularly enough, have the"" dustmen been on strike again? weather just gives flies the climate to breed easily but rubbish gives them everything else"
"Non-collection of rubbish is not why we have them, our bazuras are emptied every single day at 1.00am you can set your watch by them. http://redqueenmusings.wordpress.com"
Wonder if dogs muck could have anything to do with it then and of course people feed stray cats and leave food out all over the place.Flys need damp/wet conditions to survive and of course rotten or rotting food if these sources are removed the flys will vanish
I was told there were always a lot of flies when the banana trees were being harvested.I don't know if there's any truth in that? But we rarely see a fly when we stay in the winter and there can be wet weather then and the bin collection is the same and I'm sure dogs toilet habits are the same so I think that puts paid to those theories!
"Can anyone give us a update on the fly epidemic please, is it still as bad or has it settled down at all, we are in Los Cristianos a week today so hope its good news!!!!!Thanks Ramnit"
I've just got back from my first visit and there seemed to be a huge amount of flies around. My friends who had been there before thought there were many more than they'd encountered before. Daytime eating could be a tricky affair. The problem eases after sunset.
"It is no better and has been like this now for approx 3 weeks the bloomin flies are driving me to distractions. It has been suggested on the Tenerife Forum.org when someone said they didn´t have flies in the Puerto>>> I reckon it's because you get a more regular rainfall... I still think there are SOOOOO many flies because of the two on and off days of rain we had the other week, all the flies/maggots were like ""ohhhh everything is yucky and juicy wet, let's breeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed"" LOL ... I don't think it has anything to do with the banana plantations, they spray them every year, various times...<<<Perhaps they are right, it could be down to the weather but I can't ever remember having so many.redqueenmusings.wordpress.com"
we were there July 26th for 2 weeks - first 9 days fine the rest it was absolutely horrible - we thought it was either down to the gardener cutting hedge of maybe the golf course at back being sprayed with something but if i had have expereinced that for the whole 2 weeks it would put me off returning for sure and would have ruined my holiday. hundreds of them landing all over everything continually - it was like one of those awfully sad third world adverts on the tv landing and crawling all over people and their meals - not that this post is helpful of course but I had never seen any post from anyone ref the flies so did think it was just round our hotel as didnt seem as bad out of it.
i was in cyprus in october and there were a lot of flies around .i have not seen that many in the last 4 years.back home in kent ive hardly seen any the same goes for wasps and bees.
"Perhaps the flies have migrated from the U.K. to avoid the cold, I can,t remember the last time I spotted a fly here at home"
Maybe the Moths in your wallet are keeping them at bay !!!LOLIf the flies are still there after the recent down pours they must be on lilos !!!
Can anyone post an update please on this issue?Thanks
"There don´t seem to have been as many flies over the weekend and those that were around were very dozy and easy to swat, so fingers crossed they have gone/going. It was very hot last night though and slept with the windows open and no mozzi net drawn. Woken up by buzzing of mosquito and had two bites 8(redqueenmusings.wordpress.com"
"If you fell asleep here with the windows open you would wake up with a bite also FROST BITE but it,s lovely here in winter too"
Been to the beach to day (las vista beach) and it was a pain looked like every one one the beach had gone mad hitting them selves lol.Enjoy
"Hope they bugger off soon, we went to sharm last jan and its none stop with them landing on you as your chilling by the pool. Cross fingers for you all, i think they will go soon, unlike sharm. Regards, gunboat."
Aquilas didnt realise mosquitos were a problem in Tenerife we are regulars and have never seenone. Getting worried now we are over from the 13th Dec until 29th fingersx
yes we seen a mosquito to day now its dead lol
"I have been in Puerto for the past 3 weeks , and flies were not a problem ,,, just the odd one that seemed to take a fancy to you , like always every where .... May be they got drowned ! or sailed away to better weather in the south ! ...... ;-))  Sylla"
"Hi, likewise we were in Puerto last week, very few flys, and only because I was looking for them. However there were more outside the airport."
"not much a problem here i n the south now, though its getting a little colder for them? Enjoy"
Haven't seen any for about a week now - think ours came due to the unexpected couple of wet days which encouraged them to breed. In areas where they are used to damper weather they have not been a problem as like all of us they get used to the prevalent weather conditions and only behave differently when something out of the norm occurs.http://redqueenmusings.wordpress.com
"Hope they have all gone very soon ,we always seem to ""Adopt"" one on our visits but no great numbers ...but i see theres one or two that need swatting,they are very irritating buzzing around .Edited: 7 years ago "
