"Hey Everyone - My wife and I have a trip scheduled to Cabo in late June / early July. I'm a little curious about this corona virus stuff. Now, I know things happen and vacations get ruined (hurricanes, storms, flight cancellations, etc), but what are everyone's thoughts on this virus impacting travel to Cabo this year? Thanks!"
"The Corona Virus is a World Wide problem. If you plan to travel, Cabo is as good a place as any."
"Last time it was the swine flu. Worked out great for us traveling as most everyone else stopped. Got an all inclusive in Puerto Morelos for $87/night total for 2 adults and a kid. Nobody got sick, nobody died and the zombie apocalypse did not start. How this one will play out is a crap shoot."
And the last time before that it was zika virus. You are more likely to get the flu.

"TravelBoy24While the previous responses make light of the situation regarding the Corona Virus it isn’t something to joke about IMHO. The potential impact this could have on tourism, the global economy, not to mention the loss of life that has occurred make this virus a very real threat. June and July are still a few months away and it is impossible to predict how this all will unfold. My advice for anyone making travel plans to Cabo is to buy trip insurance and try to make reservations that can be cancelled and refunded. Personally, I am scheduled to fly to Cabo next week for Spring Break. My biggest fear is the recirculated airplane cabin air. We do have masks and could wear those on the plane but I sure don’t want to be seen wear those in Mexico as they may refuse entry. Our trip to Italy this summer is on hold due to the current Corona situation there so this trip to Cabo may be it for a while. The only Corona I want in Mexico comes from a bottle and is best served ice cold with a lime.Edited: 3:10 pm, February 26, 2020 "
"Catching a virus from recirculated cabin air is a myth, just look it up. Now if someone is sitting within a row of you and has a virus, that is a different story. Love hearing that some will climb under a rock from this maybe later this year or next we'll try Le Blanc at $300/night!"
"Maresc,Ski Aspen all time. Apres time at Cloud Nine and Ajax man. but the CoronaVirus you have to admit is getting blown up by the fakenews/media."
My only concern about the Corona Virus is that it causes me extra delays at the Airport...otherwise personally I worry more about getting the generic regular flu then Corona....my thoughts are it will have zero impact on my trip to Cabo....I wonder if Corona beer sales will be down lol
"We will also be traveling to Cabo in Mid July. The only Corona Virus I am getting are from the nice icy cold cans of Corona ( horrible insert, I know) lol"
"These statements are cut and pasted from the CDC website (updated as of yesterday, February 25th) so there is no chance that this is ""fake news,"" since it has not gone through any news sources to become ""tainted."">> On January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)""<<>>The potential public health threat posed by COVID-19 is high, both globally and to the United States.<<>>For the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus at this time, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low.<<>>...it’s important to note that current global circumstances suggest IT IS LIKELY THAT THIS VIRUS WILL CAUSE A PANDEMIC (emphasis added).

"What's your point Eljefe, are you going to quote weather forecasts next? Below is from the CDC about their predictions for the swine flu:""What is 2009 H1N1 (swine flu)?2009 H1N1 (sometimes called “swine flu”) is a new influenza virus causing illness in people. This new virus was first detected in people in the United States in April 2009. This virus is spreading from person-to-person worldwide, probably in much the same way that regular seasonal influenza viruses spread. On June 11, 2009, the World Health OrganizationExternal Web Site Icon (WHO) declared that a pandemic of 2009 H1N1 flu was underway."""
Bump back to the top
My point is to share the facts put forth by our country's experts (along with the NIH) rather than dismissing a potential pandemic as fake news because it's now a catchy phrase. Nothing more.
You have every right to be concerned for your family and it's not fake news. Coronavirus is spreading and no one knows if or when it reaches cabo. It won't hurt waiting another month or two before booking. Cabo trips can easily be arranged about 2-3 weeks before departure.
"Fake news just means news that you don't like. The CDC and the NIH know more about this than me, CraigS, and certainly more than PROV1_ASU. If you think that the news media doesn't report things accurately, don't listen to the news. Go directly to our experts. In this case that would be the CDC and the NIH. I provided a link to the CDC website, and here is a link to the NIH website: https://www.nih.gov/Those two agencies will keep you better informed about the COVID-19 virus than any travel website so that you can all make your own informed decisions."
I guess the boss just showed us who’s the boss! Please run and hide so that I can vacation on the cheap. Someday the sky will fall and all us naysayers will be wrong. Somebody’s wrong and somebody’s right and in 2 years we’ll know who. I suggest building a bunker in your backyard and never leave.
"Well I sure hope the prices go down for June travel. Right now the flights are $$$ from Seattle for end of June and the travel times are terrible to boot! I went during the N1H! scare and the flight was empty the flight attendants allowed us to come back and simply order what we wanted. Town was pretty empty too! Eljefe, Thanks for posting the link CDC info. Best to keep checking there for the latest and make your own decisions. We all know you aren't a ""sky is falling"" kind guy! Love ya and miss ya!for the record: I almost always suffer from the ""Corona flu"" when Im there :)Edited: 10:41 pm, February 26, 2020 "
"Thanks smrbrz. I find it hard to believe that anything that I cut and pasted from the CDC website would indicate that I think the sky is falling or that it's time to build a bunker.It all is real news though and worth following. It hasn't stopped me from planning trips to CSL and a couple places in Europe as well. I am making sure that I have good trip cancellation insurance though, just in case. Wait, did something just hit me on the head?.....Nah!"
"As long as you're not immunosuppressed (or very old/young) that virus is extremely unlikely to do you great harm. This isn't as nasty as Ebola virus according to CDC. I'd still buy trip/medevac insurance (well under $100) to rest easier. Sadly I sense China ignored their initial outbreak too long and caused this. Next week I'm going to the Caribean, just gonna watch the CDC website daily."

Unsure why this fool keeps regurgitating that it's fake news. People have died!
"Yes of course people have died...but no where near the number of people who die from the generic flu or even the common cold..yet only the Corona virus makes the top of the news...I am not one to say its not real, but what I do find fake is the extent and exaggeration of the coverage etc....IMO Corona will be no different the Zika, swine or mad cow....just a bunch of unnecessary hype because there nothing better to report on the nightly news...."
"This corona virus is a new virus that emerged last year and was only named about two weeks ago. Since it is so new, nobody, including the national and international health agencies know much about it. As of now, they aren't completely sure how easily or sustainably it is spread among people, what it's incubation time is, or what it's mortality rate is, but what I just heard this morning is that the initial estimate of morality from this virus is 2%. If that is accurate, that is 20 times the mortality rate from the flu (0.1%), which everybody seems to be comparing this to. Those are the reasons for concern - the unknown about the new virus and it's potential severity. It is not fake news.Given what is happening the best thing for everybody to do is to simply look in the right places for information about this stuff. For a new virus, that is not on a Tripadvisor forum. You go there/come here to find out what transfer companies are good, where to stay, where to party, where to eat, etc....not to find out the current status of a brand new virus. Go to good sources, stay informed and make informed decisions."

Just have a lot of Lime on hand.Pssst here’s a hint for ya. Ain’t nobody getting out of here alive
@MattD you have the right attitude! Salud!
I am still going to Cabo at the end of May. I feel that anyone that is worried should probably not travel. I have traveled there every 6 months for the last 8 years. Basic hygiene is always important regardless of the situation at hand.
no worries at all......ill be there in 2 weeks. gonna wipe down my seat and all on plane....and carry hand sanitizer. more concerned about if the sun will be out.
so if it was just named last week...which i disagree with.....why on lysol bottles and such does it mention corona virus???? that it kills it AND i heard a DR. speak yesterday who studied this virus 20 years ago all fake??
"aloha coachie, corona viruses are not new. This particular corona virus is new and was just named ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,"" abbreviated ""SARS-CoV-2."" The disease that it causes that everybody is talking about is ""coronavirus disease 2019,"" abbreviated ""COVID-19."" ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”. (In this case novel means new, not a fictitious narrative)Just checked my jar of Lysol wipes (being rationed since I can't seem to buy any) and it identifies ""corona viruses"", not this one by name. I don't know what it says on your label."
"Whatever you want to hear, it's out there from an EXPERT. There are doctors saying this is essentially the Plague for 2020 and others saying it's being blown way out of proportion. I've seen fatality rates as high as 3.4 and as low as .6. I've read that the virus is not heat resistant and will die off as temperatures rise. I've even read that consuming alcohol and spicy food may help fight off this particular virus.As far as taking the CDC word for word, I'm not saying they are lying but they have to error on the side of caution...by a large margin. Same thing when we're told not to travel to Cabo because it's so dangerous yet EVERY REGULAR on here calls it nonsense and still travels there. But aren't they the experts since it's the government?"
"I think people just have to make up their own minds on thisEveryone has a different tolerance for worry. I'd be the most worried about being quarantined and not being able to get home to my dogsVulnerable people and the elderly should speak to their personal doctors and others can watch the travel advisories from their respective governmentsIf this were me right now, at this particular moment, I would choose to travel to Cabo. But that's me. People need to decide for themselvesIt's also not a bad idea to buy insurance that will allow people to cancel for any reason"
eljefe.....thank you for the info. i stand corrected. i agree this virus is not new.....but a new one this year. stay safe
"My ""Expert"" opinion is that there are no experts on this forum on the matter of the corona virus. Experts on drinking corona perhaps :) Now we all know it would be ridiculous to heed the advice of strangers on the internet on a travel forum. It seems most posts are just looking for some discussion on the topic as in ""whats the word on the street in Cabo"". Well, reports this morning from the beach indicate that its warm with spring breakers enjoying themselves and 1 ship in the bay. I personally would rather be there than here and will head down end of the month as well as end of June! Fingers crossed that the chaos settles down soon!"
Very good read by someone who DOES know...https:/…
"Jay B ~ any link that thinks it's ""corvid"" (that means crow family) instead of COVID is not a good resource.>>letter-from-toronto-an-infectious-diseases-specialist-reflects-on-corvid-19<<Here is a direct link to Dr Abdu Sharawy's Facebook page. He does have some good thoughts.https://www.facebook.com/abdu.sharkawyHis March 5th post is the one that has gotten the most attention."
"Great article, Jay B."
"""corvid"" is not anywhere in that article..."
"Correct. Dr Abdu Sharawy does not use the word ""corvid."" It is in the link URL from talbotspy . org >>reflects-on-corvid-19<<But I think it's better to go right to the source, Dr Abdu Sharawy's Facebook page. His continuing posts might be good reading for some folks. No need to look at another website quoting his Facebook posts."
How’s your fake/news comment feel now??
But President Trump just said it’s a National Emergency.
You wrote this February 26. Do you still think it’s fake news? Even #45 got tested.
"thank you, post #5 for making a sensible post early on when people were still calling this all fake news. Pandemics are not to be sneezed at, no pun intended."
"Here is my personal take on the “fake news” (there is PLENTY of it getting shoved down the American people’s throats by the MSM) Don’t want to or care to start a whose side is right just my personal take.Rather in this context they are referring to the fact that this different strain of “flu” is getting blown WAY out of proportion. Should we take it seriously and take the necessary precautions?.... ABSOLUTELY, no one wants to see their elder parents or grandparents with predisposed immune issues get into a situation.Should people be going to the nearest store and buying them out of all toiletries , water, produce , and meats?... ABSOLUTELY NOT. That is absurd. We are on for late May and will go as long as it is allowed or until common sense tells us otherwise.My personal opinion 2 cents"
Just wondering if you went for spring breaking how it was?
"Hi Passenger283102, and welcome to TripAdvisor forums. This is a somewhat older thread as things are changing quickly with respect to the coronavirus. Your question is not related to the topic. But some other folks may want to know if anyone traveled to Mexico during the outbreak. Start a new thread to ask. And look at the webcams, once the sun comes up. Very few people on the beach. Most folks wisely decided to stay safe at home."
"Things are looking like May is the time to go! Cabo TimeEdited: 2:07 pm, March 24, 2020 "
We cancelled our flight to Cabo that left yesterday and rescheduled for September. Just not worth the risk for us
"Dear Ms Diane Grant, On behalf of the Los Cabos Tourism Board, we thank you for your preference and for rescheduling your trip to Los Cabos. Hoping you and your family remain safe. Cordially,Los Cabos Tourism Board"
Yesterday the Head of the Ministry of Health in Baja California Sur predicted that COVID-19 infections will reach their peak in June. (There are a few different threads so I put this here as well. Don't mean to double post.)
"Very smart! We had to cancel Cancun, which we love, but as you said, we will be back!"
As a side bar.....check with the airlines. SouthwestAirlines cancelled our flights for May 16 to June 1
Southwest plans on resuming Cabo service on May 21st according to their website
"I still have my May 30 Cabo trip on the books, but am expecting to have to cancel it. We will see."
"Hello, I am a local, if everything goes as planed, Most of the hotels, will be normally operating by May 1st. But as you know things can change from one day to another. Most importan have a flexible cancellation or modification reservation. And check again mid april."
"Good evening, Rocio, and welcome to this message board.It's great to have a local voice, in tune with what is happening with all aspects of life in Cabo.Stay safe and we look forward to more from you in the coming uncertain days!Cheers,cmasia"
Trip is on for May and will stay on! Word from our property managers is what Rocio said above! Salud!
"Hi Rocio. I hate to be skeptical, but what kind of plan does Los Cabos have that would get the hotels up and running in a month? Here in Washington State we had the first confirmed case of COVID-19 on January 21st. It has now been over 2 months, cases are still increasing and our governor has just ordered another month of physical restrictions to try to contain the virus. All of us in Washington State (and I suspect the rest of the US as well) would love to learn the details of the local plan that will allow the people of Los Cabos to return to a normal life in that short period of time when no one else in the world has been able to contain the virus so quickly. Oh, I am also curious if you happen to represent any business interests in Los Cabos?"
"NY and many American states are having a huge problem with COVID-19. In NY its not expected to peak for another 2 weeks to a month. At that point even if COVID-19 starts to decline, it could be a couple of months before the infection runs its course. That could put us into August. And thats a big IF. No one knows if the Los Cabos work force will be healthy in May. This Virus will certainly cause havoc in Mexico too. Thats a big unknown ! Good Luck, But May vacations to Cabo are Highly unlikely."
"Hyatt Ziva has officially announced on it’s website that it will be closed until June 1. But a customer got an email saying it was closed until October.https:/…Edited: 2:12 am, April 03, 2020 "
"Pantix, apparently the Hotel Association made a decision to ""cancel April,"" so I suspect all the hotels and timeshares will put out the same message....sooner or later.Edited: I forgot to say""Stay healthy out there Rocky!!!""Edited: 10:33 am, April 03, 2020 "
"Thank You John...... Im finished worrying about COVID-19 I am gearing up to worry about hurricanes : }Edited: 1:09 pm, April 03, 2020 "
"Rocky G, well in that case, start stocking up on rum."
"just spoke to a Mexican friend in La Ribera (we used to own a house there). He said the Los Cabos airport is closed as of today & folks are hunkering down, even in his small town. They are just starting to test for coronavirus in the outlying areas."
MMSL (Private Airport) is open for business
"Rocky & Eljefe: We just got the notice from our beachfront condo complex that the pools and beach are now closed due to the governor's orders.PROV: Just curious. Are you still planning on going in May if the US an Mexican governments continue their requests for people not to travel? And, if so, if you are asymptomatic, how may people do you think you might infect or kill with your disrespectful determination. Or do you care?Edited: 10:24 pm, April 03, 2020 "
"Big Pantix: Recently came back from Tulum. Have tested neg. Not infecting any body. Of course I care, and plan on still going. You're free to express how you feel towards my opinion. Sending you good vibes"
"Dear Ms or Mrs, We thank you for preference in Los Cabos. We can inform you the following:The private and public sector recommends all national and international travelers postpone their upcoming vacation trips to Los Cabos in an effort to avoid the spread of the virus across the destination. Additionally, on March 20th, 2020, the U.S. government announced the temporary closing of the U.S. and Mexico border to nonessential travel in response to the global impact of COVID-19. The measure follows the U.S. Department of State’s implementation of a Global Level 4 Health Advisory on March 19th, 2020 advising all U.S. citizens to avoid international travel due to the outbreak. For U.S. Citizens living in or visiting Los Cabos, we advise them to adhere to the guidance provided by the U.S. State Department at travel.state.gov for more information.For any additional inquires, do not hesitate to call the BCS COVID-19 hotline number at +52 612 199 53 86 for information in English or contact Los Cabos Tourism Board at covid19@visitloscabos.travel."
"As the Covid-19 situation is evolving worldwide, Los Cabos will continue monitoring the outbreak and keep all travelers informed as of when all traveling activities will return to normal. While we cannot give a concrete timeline, all non-essential businesses are currently closed and will be through April 30th. Los Cabos’ state and local authorities will continue to work jointly to strengthen the destination’s health and security protocols in order to contain the spread of the virus. The health and safety of our community and visitors is our utmost priority. We plan to share updates as we get them. Cordially, Los Cabos Tourism Board"

"Hi Rocio,Just checking in for any updates... We have a trip planned May 28, and still not sure if we will be able to go. Any information will be greatly appreciated!!!"
vickid ~ I would not be comfortable with travel to Cabo in late May and would wait longer. I hope there will be additional scientific and data-based information to help you make your decision.
Based on information from our friends in Cabo it will probably be a month or two.
"I too, have a trip planned, beginning June 6 for a couple weeks. I have my own condo, so I wouldn’t be at a timeshare per se, but I have younger children and don’t want to expose them to anything. They’ve done a pretty amazing job with staying in since school was canceled. After reading several opinions and other news bits that people have come across, I’m a bit more apprehensive to go ahead with the trip. Heck, I’m not even sure the airlines will be operating again, down there. Thoughts???"
"I also have a trip planned, May 30. Pretty sure it is not going to happen. Just cancelled a trip to Puerto Vallarta for this month, so two cancellations would really be disappointing."
Just got an email from American airlines that there will not be any change fees for flights thru September 30th
I held off on cancelling our trip to Cabo at the end of August. I had a great deal but just couldn't afford it now since everything in the States has slowed down. My income has dropped by 75%. I just can pay my bills now and have no extra. I was so looking forward to Cabo since my Sons and I have never been. Looking to reschedule for a year from now.
"I was scheduled to go to Cabo for 9 days with my wife on May 5th. We were really looking forward to this trip. We went last year and it was a really wonderful time for us. But I postponed our trip to late October as soon as the shutdowns started in March. And now I wonder about what life will be like in the fall.We live in Northern NJ about 20 miles from NYC. Things are really, really bad here. As I write this, 5 New Jersey hospitals in North Jersey are diverting patients to other hospitals because they are over capacity. 9 people died in a nursing home 10 minutes from my home and people are waiting in their cars for 9 hours on mile long lines to try and get a test for the virus. I’ve devolved from dreaming about vacations to a persistent low level panic about getting sick and being hospitalized which might kill me as I’m in that high risk group. It seems like everyday that light at the end of the tunnel keeps moving further away. Last month I thought for sure that by mid-October it would be safe to travel again but when I really look at the prospect of traveling honestly I’m becoming more pessimistic by the day (I’m an optimistic by nature, but I’m also a realist). I am starting to think that the return to normalcy may mean months of going to work with masks on all day (no matter where you work). And the travel and hospitality industries are going to just be hammered and the absolute last places to reopen. Drinking Margaritas through respirator masks isn’t going to work.But I will remain hopeful that life will improve. I will remain grateful for each day. I will try and remember about the families in sorrow and do what I can to make things better. And maybe down the road I’ll be sitting with my wife on Medano Beach staring at Lands End for hours. I’m sure I’ll appreciate that day more than ever. Stay well everyone!!!"
"It is heart breaking to see the devastation in NY and NJ caused by the virus. We must remind ourselves that, in time, this too will pass. In times like this a little fear can be our friend as it motivates us to be diligent, disinfect, social distance ourselves and stay home - taking small pleasure in The simple things in life. We are hopeful things will be better by late October. The good news is that the people in Los Cabos are strong and know how to bounce back - having to face and recover from tropical storms and hurricanes annually. The other good news is that there will be a vaccine in probably 12 - 14 more months so if this year doesn’t work out at least next year will.Hang in there!"
"Appreciate your reporting Pantix,all-It is informative and puts things in perspective. Today,my Birthday,I had planned to be in Cabo on the beach. I will appreciate more what I have in the NOW. Cabo I hope recovers in a few months...and Medano will be there waiting for us to return."

"We were booked to go in middle of June, but the resort informed us that they will stay closed through the month of June. Our flight (on Alaska) hasn't been cancelled our flight (yet?), but some of our friends that were going at the same time were (Southwest). At this point, I don't want to go and be stressed out about what's going on rather than relaxing. The local authorities have some quarantine order up until may 30th I believe."
Alaska Airlines is allowing folks to cancel. https:/…travel-advisories
Did you go?
HI Trixxie323There are current threads on the forum with reports from folks who are in Cabo San Lucas or who have just returned. This February thread is a bit older.
How is/was your trip?
