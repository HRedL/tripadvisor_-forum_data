Hi we are booked on April 9 and want to know the situation in St Lucia about the Corona Virus ?
As of most recent press release from the Ministry of Health ”There are no Corona Virus cases in St. Lucia or the Caribbean region.”https:/…
"When we landed at UVF on Feb 8, I was in the front of the plane when the door opened. The Lucian ground crew requested a report stating various information and that no one on board was showing signs of illness. They said an email had been sent to the airline the previous day, but the crew said no one from United had told them anything about it. The ground personnel required them to write out the information before anyone could deplane. We also talked to some cruise passengers on a dive boat that said they were delayed a little while disembarking due to some new health protocols. So it sounds like St Lucia is trying to take some measures to monitor arriving visitors. A huge task, but they are trying.Edited: 2:27 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"The authorities have turned away some cruise ships, one with norovirus cases and yet other with a suspected corona virus case. What is worrying is the lack of hospital facilities in St Lucia unless you have good private insurance. I suspect that temperature taking of passengers will happen shortly."
I think I am safer here then the US. Just landed yesterday and if you have been to China in the last two weeks or are a Chinese national you are not getting in. They are taking it very seriously. The biggest issue is travelling in and of itself. I flew through a smaller airport and then MIA - being in MIA is more concerning tbh.
useful to know Tricia. Thanks… I am going out again in the summer so keeping an eye on this.. It might be by that time that the problem is diminishing or we have so many cases in the UK that St Lucia bans us! Hopefully not..
"What is the update now? We will be coming fromToronto, Canada and thinking if we cancel?"
"Yep were also in the same boat were scheduled to go for Easter from Toronto via Air Canada/ Air Canada vacations We havent cancelled yet but we’ll see how it all plays out. I’ve been watching how many seats are available on the plane that have been pre-selected (for a fee) on Air Canada’s airline web site. You can preview the seats on there website. So far out of the 100+ seats only 31 have been pre selected 25 economy and 6 business class (we have business class) . Granted there are others that have booked but have not elected to spend the $$ for seat selection and just wing it when they get to the airport. As a guess if 50% of the bookings don’t due pre-selection then as a guess there’s 60 people or maybe a little more thats booked for that flight. Since we have business class were allowed to use Air Canada’s Maple Leaf Lounge in TO been there before and that usually isn’t crowded.  Once were down there I don’t think it will be that big a deal since there will be less people on the beach and hotel along with less cruise ship people if they even allow them to dock. Thinking on this is that occupancy will be more like when we’ve gone to other islands in the summertime or about 50% full My thought is by Easter things will either get better or worse either way Air Canada vacations is giving there basic Careflex to anyone whos booked for April so we could reschedule the entire vacation for May to December or maybe into next year. This cancellation is good for up to 3 days before you travel.  The only other precaution I will take is maybe getting a private transfer one way to the Hotel if we do end up going in April  The wifes only concern is she’s afraid we will get quarantined when we get back either in Canada or when we cross the border back in Buffalo time will tell how far they take the border closuresEdited: 8:59 am, March 12, 2020 "
"Donna B: there's been no material changes here in St Lucia. We still have zero cases; we've had a couple (3 if memory serves) people who've had suspected cases but ended up negative. It's business as usual around here for now. Hotels are still at Max occupancy, airlines still flying in as normal, etc What the situation will be tomorrow or next week, or next month - no one can possibly know. This is an incredibly fluid situation, changing hour to hour, at times minute to minute. You need to do what's best for you and yours."
We are due to fly in on the 19th April and I was thinking exactly the same thing will the St Lucians let us in
"Tilli - see response above . However, your travels are more than a month away, it's literally anyone's guess what the situation will be at that time.At this time, there's no ban/stop on folks from UK. Just the countries listed above: South Korea, Italy, China, Iran, etc."
"As expected, the novel coronavirus has reached out shores, via a visitor. No sign of community transmission at this time. No one she traveled with has yet shown sighs of infection..https:/…"

"Yes Joanne B, as noted in post directly before yours, with link to the news article with further info.At current, one case."
"Hey, we’re meant to be travelling from UK to St Lucia on Friday 20th i understand there is only one case... but can someone help me decide if I should cancel or not... we are leaving two children behind with grandparents first time... it’s been booked for 10 months as a surprise for my partners 30th... I know allot can change in 5 days I don’t see that being for the good... few things - I’m worried at Lucia might start shutting down if cases increase, I’m worried we won’t be allowed over as we’re from a country with it, I’m worried we’re get told we can’t return (could be worse)... obviously we won’t travel if we have any signs or feel unwell we also don’t want to put anyone at risk. Soooo basically I’m in two minds and need an outsiders point of view as everything at home is saying go unless banned..."
"KateEMW - no one here can possibly advise you. And, at least from my point of view, taking info and advice from random internet strangers probably isn't the best idea.You need to do what's best for you and yours. Currently, there is no (real) talk of the country shutting down, or banning flights from UK, etc. There's also currently been no cases of community transmission, etc. The one case is a foreign national, and has been in isolation for a few days. Those she traveled with currently show no signs, but who knows what the future may bring? What the situation may look like in 1 day, let alone 5 days, is anyone's guess. There's a lot of misinformation flying around, and a lot of useless panic, not being helped by all the misinformation by any means. You do have some time - and obviously, if the country Babs flights, your airline and/or hotel and/or tour agency would have to refund fares or provide future Trav credit, etc. At least that's been the case elsewhere.. definitely check what sort of coverage you may have in case of cancellations. Who can say - only you can make those decisions for you and yours, given your own circumstances, health, family needs, work needs, etc. Good luck, and have a great time if you do visit! We've been having some seriously glorious weather, seas have been extraordinarily calm and clear, etc."
"Why the hell y'all still travelling with this dangerous virus around. Y'all booked seriously dumb asses need to stay put and stay out of planesEdited: 1:24 am, March 14, 2020 "
"Thank you, I was just looking for some opinions to help me out a little. Given you live on the island and there isn’t much really talk of much changing that sounds reassuring.Thank you and hopefully we make it over!!"
Kate - I have lived in St Lucia for 10 years and aside of dealing with C-19 the community have more experience than most of epidemics due to having summer rainy seasons surges in our mosquito population. We have also had tourist imported illnesses on island like norovirus hit hotels here and so the majority of the resorts have clear protocols in place to manage dealing with it. Cleaning and deep cleaning is undertaken as routine plus ground treatment for mosquitos. Would be more concerned as to whether flights are running as scheduled and will be able to get you back from the island but from experience the resorts will do all they can to deliver services to their guests. Hope that helps with the decision. Katie
"We're meant to be travelling to St.Lucia this week but have decided against it having taken advice from a senior medical practitioner in the UKApparently St.Lucia had no ability to test for Covid-19 until a couple of days ago as they had no testing kits plus they don't have the medical equipment such as respirators on the island should one fall ill and require such intervention.Whilst the testing kits have now arrived - it's possible/likely that there are others who have the virus who have not yet been identified.Whilst many will only get mild symptoms should they fall ill - the reality of requiring hospitalised intervention in a country who's Prime Minister has stated is not geared up to deal with this situation although doing everything in his power to take evasive measures is in my view a cause for concern.As a family we were on the receiving end of such a situation whereby my father in law fell ill in Barbados with the net result being £66,000 of repatriation costs after being flown to Maimi for immediate medical intervention. Thankfully the insurance cover he had paid for everything. This was not Covid-19 related.In addition to the above - I've currently a slight temperature plus a cough and it's sore when I breathe in - no way am I badly I'll but I'm self isolating just to be safe.We were really looking forward to our holiday in St.Lucia as we rarely manage to take time out as a couple - but irrelevant of whether I was self isolating or not - we decided it's safer to remain put."
It is simply not true to state they don't have respirators on island - there are critical care services in at least three hospital locations there just isn't enough kit to deal with the numbers that are being discussed so yes the island will struggle if tourists decide to travel sick and aren't mindful of the current UK Govt advice on self-isolation. Please be aware that whilst your Senior NHS person has an opinion they are not on the ground in St Lucia and are making blanket statements without the facts to back it up and we def have respirators and mainly British trained Doctors who are excellent.
"Hi there.We are due to travel on the 20th March and at the moment are still going to go ahead with our travel plans.Is there any news on which resort the infected person was staying in?Many thanksEdited: 5:27 am, March 14, 2020 "
"Hi Kate, we are due to travel on the 18th and our main concern is that if the situation escalates in the uk while we're out there and flights to and from are disrupted, will we get back ok."
stluciannewsonline.com/insufficient-space-in…I hope the above link works.
Sadly link above doesn't seem to work. Google 'insufficient space in Saint Lucia for major cononavirus outbreak says PM Chastanet'.As things stand 20% of those with Covid-29 in Italy have required intensive care treatment irrelevant of their age.Taking this into consideration along with PM Chastanet's assessment - and the conclusion which I have drawn seems logical.
"We had our 30th wedding anniversary planned there last week but canceled 2 days prior to leaving. The medical care there is not good we've heard, not to mention there is discussion of using a small, remote island (Rat Island...you can google it!) for quarantine. I can't even imagine. One of our doctors familiar with the island said it was a huge risk (to our lives should we fall ill) to go there at this time. Not to mention the concern of not being able to come home. Wasn't worth it to us! We will rebook and go another time!"
"Kirby: no, the government has not released the name of the hotel. It won't matter, much, in the long run as all hotels have out in place even more strict hygiene practices, etc. The government has said they've been monitoring those she traveled with and so far they're not showing any symptoms, and that they're monitoring those she may have come in contact with her, but that's a large task, and we can only trust them to do what they can. In fluid situations like this - that's all we can work with Kate: as noted, you need to do what's best for you and yours. The government is in emergency meetings this weeke d, and is supposedly giving an update Monday on the overall situation. Hopefully there will be further news, and guidance on what steps may be taken. Right now - it's simply outs speculation - sheer guesses on what may happen Adventure- Rat Island was never ever a serious option for quarantine. SMH. It's amazing how rumors spread. There's no electricity, running water - or space - to set-up a quarantine there. It simply wasn't ever a viable option, simply one thing thrown out in brainstorming. There is more solid word that probably Dennery medical facikites, and others, would be used for quarantine if needed but again - it's mainly speculation, there hasn't been official word as yet. We do have test kits on island (according to our government), however it does take time to train personnel in using them correctly. Theoretically, we'll be able to test for ourselves come next week. We all need to be patient and stick with facts. Rampant speculation on the internet helps no one, lest of all those of us who live here and have to deal with both our own country's welfare (and our own welfare) plus help get real information out to visitors. I know everyone wants answers immediately in this day and age of instant gratification, buy the real world simply doesn't work that way. It is taking time for our government to get sorted out - fortunately we had some time before the virus reached out shores. Please, for all our sales, use common sense, wash your hands, and stick to real information versus rumors or speculation or ""something you heard"".Stay safe out there."
We are here now. Yesterday the banned public gatherings such as the street party so it feels like it’s gathering pace. The whole mood of the place has changed. We are wishing we hadn’t come tbh
That’s very helpful thank you fir being so clever after the fact. Truth is many if these trips have been booked and paid for for over 6 months. I cannot afford to lose £7k even if you can. So keep your useless advice to yourself.
"We are here now. We were kept in the runway fior 2.5 hours because a passenger had a nose bleed, they are hyper cautious and rightly so. Last night public gatherings were banned and today the whole mood of the place has changed. It wouldn’t surprise me if Tui cancel in the future any way but if they don’t don’t consider coming imo"
Brian R is it that bad...? We’re due on Friday... for my partner surprise 30th trip... soo reluctant to cancel but that might be out of my hands but if your saying you wish you didn’t go... what’s different I mean I’ve never been but just curious?Thank you
We have a trip planned on March29th for 6 nights at an all-inclusive. Booked it through Travel Zoo. I feel this pandemic will escalate rapidly in the US (we're from Boston) I don't think they will refund any of the trip for any reason. We will be at a loss. We are also in out 60's (hi risk). Don't know what to do -- go or not go?I'd gladly take a credit for another time.
"Kate - in not sure what's so different for Brian. Yes, a flight was recently held, out if caution, while a passenger was checked. No case of covid-19 there. But cautious, as all nations are being now The Street Party is the only thing on the immediate calendar that's been cancelled. Jazz has been cancelled, for May, two months from now. Otherwise, most everywhere is business as usual. People are somewhat in shock, given our first case has been diagnosed, and information is still scarce from our government. I stand by what I've written earlier - everyone needs to decide for themselves, based on facts, what's best for them and theirs. There's currently no bans in travel between anywhere that airlines fly to/from in St Lucia. Whether that will change after this weekend's meeting, and PMs address to the nation Monday or Tuesday is anyone's guess. That's all it is at this point. Hit the grocery store today, just to see the current moods, at least at my local one, shelves were stocked as normal, no panic buying or anything of the sort. People were a little more abrupt with each other, most just wanting to get in and get out instead of the usual banter - it's uncertain times, everywhere. Whether you visit or not, is entirely up to you - at this point. There haven't been bans in anyone from. USA, UK, most of Europe, neighboring Caribbean, etc.Brian- who is it you're responding to? As you can see, posts don't embed when you hit reply, they just come up as the next comment. It's unfortunate you're not enjoying yourself, we've had some killer great weather and such this past week. And fortunately some much needed rain today! Hopefully you'll make the best of the rest of your visit."
"Destination - that's a question for TravelZoo. They have your booking contract, any refunds or credits come through them. I would assume they're a stand-up company and would credit your trip if flights were cancelled or a travel ban were to be announced. Whether to visit or not, only you can make that decision for you and yours, based on the variety of variables. Best of luck.Stay safe out there."
My wife and I were scheduled to travel to St. Lucia on March 28 from the US. We have decided to defer this trip until May when hopefully things have calmed down. There has been one case confirmed in St Lucia. The biggest risk for us that weighed heavy in our decision was the possibility that things get worse while we are on the island and then travel restrictions are imposed either by St Lucia or your home country that prohibit your return for a period of time. That is something you need to think about.
"We were in a similar situation. We decided to cancel our trip which was a ver difficult situation as we were going for a friends wedding. We were mostly concerned with getting back and the care that we would receive there. I read a lot of articles, 1 stated that they limited amount of hospital beds and another option for quarantine was an island called ""rat island"". Everyone situation is unique, we made the decision for our family and work"

"I am due to be travelling on Saturday 21st to St Lucia, and at the moment taking each day as it comes. At this time, because no flights etc have been banned or cancelled, I wouldnt be eligible to get any of my money back via insurance. I'm self isolating at the moment- not because I'm sick, just because I want to take necessary precautions. I think all anyone can do is take it day by day and if flights/holidays go ahead continue to travel safely and take necessary precautions whilst away."
"The hubby and I are planning to travel on Wednesday to St. Lucia. We are cautiously optimistic and will take the necessary safety precautions. At this moment, just taking it day by day."
"Shannel, have a lovely trip if all goes to plan. Do you mind updating us of how it is when you arrive...? We’re due on Friday!Thank you fingers crossed a safe journey for you"
I agree but insurance companies won't pay out if you just cancel and you then lose thousands.
There are 2 confirmed corona cases so far; St Lucia has closed all educational institutions; the Jazz fest has been cancelled. This is just beginning to ramp up as the Caribbean is starting to see cases and is forced to take precautions just like the rest of the world.
https:/…
"Citizens of UK, Spain, Germany can no longer visit as of midnight Monday. https:/…"
"We are in StLucia at the moment,there are some people self isolating for precautionary measures,and excursions are getting cancelled,, we have had two cancelled but otherwise it's ok,weather is gorgeous, only 2 cases here that have been confirmed"
"Thank you @KateEMW. I most certainly will!Edited: 9:35 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"And this is why we have some patience in these trying times. Ahead of the national address supposedly coming Monday, the St Lucian government has already implemented several new policies All educational institutions of any kind are closed effective immediately until April 13. All those from UK, Iran, Spain, Germany - those nation's have been added to the travel ban into St Lucia. That's in addition to Italy, South Korea, China, etc. Effective 12am March 17. No word on how long the travel restrictions will be in place, similar to other nation's travel bans. Cruise ports have been closed. (somewhat moot, as most all cruise lines have suspended operations, but it's officially closed).Also in talks with Martinique with regards to potentially limiting travel between the two islands. They recorded their first covid-19 deathon Sunday.. I'm sure there will be a scramble for folks to get home. (We're not kicking Anyone out, of course, but I can imagine most will want to get back home) Anyone planning to visit in the next 30-60 days, definitely get checking on your holiday providers for updates, credits or refunds, etc. This is an incredibly fluid situation, changes and updates happening at any time Stay safe out there.Edited: 10:09 pm, March 15, 2020 "
"Aruba just announced they are closing off the island for the next 2 weeks, I would guess it will be longer though. We are supposed to be going to St. Lucia on the 18th of next month, we haven’t officially cancelled yet because we are waiting on the resort. I would be surprised if we are allowed to go. We have already started matching calendars to go either in the fall or even this time next year. Be smart folks and stay safe."
Are the airports closing flights from the uk down ?
Are the airports closing flights from the uk down ?British airways is still saying my flight is going ahead ?
We are here now. Does anyone know how we get out if flights coming in are suspended ?? So nervous.
We should be arriving on Friday. BA keep saying the flight is going ahead. Other than St Lucia online news nothing about UK being unable to travel.We will keep waiting for news. Totally understand how hard this is for everyone making the decisions.
"BA still says my flight is going ahead. Just phoned St Lucia embassy in UK and they said they aren't answering questioning from individuals but they are liasing with the airlines. I told them that airline said it was still on and they said OK it's fine then. Who knows what's going on!Edited: 7:51 am, March 16, 2020 "
"Thank you for this latest information. I've been trying to contact our provider, TraveZoo. However, they've been unresponsive. We are to arrive on Mar 29 and have heard nothing from them so far. I assume the island will close off completely to new arrivals.Very worrisome and frustrating with regard to TravelZoo.."
"I read somewhere else that travel companies are unwilling to give information out unless your holiday is less than 72 hours away. It’s a fast moving situation. I don’t know travel zoo, but I would judge them on these extraordinary circumstances. We all will need to be calm and patient. Hope you get to have a great holiday!"
"From stlucianewsonline.com:In an effort to restrict the likelihood of introduction of COVID-19 into the Saint Lucian population, the Department of Health and Wellness on February 4, 2020, put in place travel restrictions on non-nationals with a travel history within the last 14 days from mainland China, (whether in-transit or originating).The Department of Health and Wellness extended the travel restrictions of persons with a travel history within the last 14 days to Hong Kong, Republic of Korea, Japan, Italy and Singapore effective Wednesday, February 26 at 12 a.m.We note an escalation in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 cases internationally as well as the spread to 122 countries outside of China, including the Caribbean region. As such, we extend the travel restrictions of persons with a travel history within the last 14 days to include Spain, mainland France, Germany and Iran, and the United Kingdom effective Tuesday, March 17, 2020, at 12 a.m.The article goes on to note that all cruise ships will refused as well until further notice. That is going to kill a lot of vendors and tour operators."
"I’ve not got a reply from British Airways , phone goes dead after a while waiting I’ve emailed the hotel we were going to , go see what they know"
"We are also due to fly out with British Airways on Friday. Received an email this morning to say the flight is still going ahead, though have now seen the St Lucia news imposing the travel ban from the UK. No advice has yet been updated on the FCO website. We have contacted them to find out about this as our insurance covers will be dependant on this."
A cynical person might say the airline is hoping that we will cancel before that is imposed by FCO.We are holding tight. If/ once the news is officially announced then we can get reimbursed.I’m not too worried about getting suitcases out of the loft currently.
"Just received email fromBritish airways , full refund on its way Obviously I’d rather be going on holiday to this beautiful island but it’ll have to wait St Lucia - see you on the other side x"
"Well said, Keith.When I tell my foreign friends from Saint Lucia and the Philippines that Toronto was last hit by a hurricane (Hazel) in 1954 and the worst earthquake near Toronto was a 5.5 in the 1940s or so, their eyes roll.Now, here in Canada, you could pay $50 for a single roll of used toilet paper......Rich"
"There is now, devestating for all"
"Bon jou tout moun,Lucian national s flying in, visitors are staying home.Those visitors still on island are cutting short their vacations and flying out.Travel restrictions to Saint Lucia apply from Hong Kong, Singapore, Republic of Korea, Japan, Iran, UK, Mainland France, Italy, Spain, Germany.No travel restrictions to/from Martinique, which is a French Overseas Territory or DOM-TOM (Départements et Territoires d'Outre-Mer).AND no travel restrictions on the 1000s of Chinese ""Saint Lucians"" who have bought citizenship. Many of whom are expected for the 3rd China Horse Club race this Saturday.Best advice is Stay at Home...Bless up! PaulEdited: 8:48 am, March 17, 2020 "
We are here right now. We are staying on our resort as that is what we’ve been asked to do. It’s very quiet- hardly any guests at a The Wind Jammer. Fitness center and all large group activities canceled. No excursions. Still beautiful but we aren’t getting to experience the island as we’d hoped. We fly back on Saturday and as of now AA hasn’t stopped flights back home to the US. The airport took the temperature of every person coming off the airplane. Lots of hand sanitizer everywhere. Staff at the hotel is constantly cleaning. Honestly we feel safer here than home as far as catching anything. Our only concern is getting home!
"Congomon- again, updated from your info.Congomon - you're behind the times on this one.The horse race was cancelled as of several days ago.And there's no travel to Martinique as France has closed their borders - all their borders, including French Overseas Territory, meaning Martinique. No one in or out except French citizens, and permanent residents, and a few select other categories. And Express Des Isles suspended services between all their ports.As an FYI. I know things are changing rapidly, it's tough to keep up.."
No one saw this one coming ...https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-812…
"We just returned from St. Lucia after cutting our trip short. We considered our country's border closings, as well the closings on the island after the first cases emerged. The mood at our resort was increasingly dismal as it became emptier and emptier. The employees realize that the resorts won't be able to sustain this much longer. It was all very sad. If you have the option of postponing, I would."

"In St Lucia right now staying at Rendezvous.Received letter 24 hours ago from hotel saying they are closing on 20th March, this Friday. We are due to fly back on 24th. Still not heard anything from Tui advising us what will happen!!!"
I have read about new cases and three hotel closures. Do you know which hotels have closed?
"Brandon - the only two confirmed so far are LeSport/BodyHoliday and Rendezvous. It's pure speculation as to the other one at this time. Loads of rumors, so far all proving to be false, for the time being. They have info on their website and FB pages, etc. Closing Friday March 20 till May 31."
"there are two confirmed cases and two ladies in quarantine ... I leave April 11 but my govt is against anyone flying out of country from canada. our border closed from US. Sunwing isn't giving full refunds if trip is April 10, just read 3 resorts shutting down did not name. and govt'rec no groups over 50. Im going insane want my money back. people are bringing this virus everywhere."
"Leah - for the resorts shutting doors, please see post directly before yours. #76. Those are the only ones actually confirmed at this time. Other properties have t yet put out further info. As for refunds, you'll need to take thst uo with Sunwing. As your borders are closed, it's unlikely you'll be flying in 3.5 weeks. And the situation here may be (likely will be) entirely different. If you can be patient for a bit with regards to refunds, in sure Sunwing will get to you and your dates next. As you can imagine, it's a major undertaking to handle all the cancellations and changes for trios all over the world. Give then a chance to get to your dates. Please do reconsider leisure travel at this time - yes, people traveling are taking the virus elsewhere. We can each do our part to help flatten the curve by staying home as much as possible, social distancing, and so forth. Leisure travel definitely doesnt fall under those guidelines...Good luck with Sunwing and stay safe!!"
We just switched our flight to go back to the US tomorrow. Things are shutting down here- it’s very quiet. Breaks my heart for the hard working locals. We WILL come back!
"We were booked to go to Rendezvous on May 10-17 with Westjet from Canada. Saw online that they are closing until May 31st (for now anyway).We just changed the booking to June 14-21. Not too confident that this will be a go but am prepared to change this to next winter if need be.Feeling bad, we love St. Lucia and Rendezvous but will get there sometime."
"Leah, if you decide to travel and somehow find a way, keep in mind that:Your Canadian health insurance --- government OR private ---- is not valid if you do."
"Quick update on post #74. We are being transferred from Rendezvous to Royalton for our last four nights.Our flight back to UK as scheduled on 24th March. Anyone due to stay beyond that date will have holiday cut short and will be on same flight. This applies to TUI flights.Will update if that changes.Edited: 11:05 pm, March 18, 2020 "
"We are booked in St Lucia for 22 March 2020, is the beaches still open for bathing??"
Can someone definitely tell me no flights are coming in from the UK and allowing us to disembark and have our holiday My flight is showing still live tomorrow and I keep getting emails from BA as if I’m still going ?
"If you look at the FCO website you will see1- you should not travel unless essential. You may not be able to return as borders shut2 - St Lucia will not let UK citizens in.My flight for tomorrow still shows as scheduled, I had to opt for a voucher or cancel and get a refund. This cost £35 per person. I can only imagine flights are leaving with only St Lucian nationals on to go home and returning with holiday makers coming back to the UK."
Did you not say you had email saying refund on the way? You had given me hope as we are supposed to be going in 4 weeks :-)Keep posting and hope you get your refund!
"We had a booking at Rendezvous for May 10-17 but saw on their webpage that they are closed until May 31 (at least). We were booked with Westjet Vacations, coming from Toronto. We were able to change our booking until June 14, knowing full well we may be postponing again.We are disappointed as we had this trip booked for so long but realize ours is a first world problem and we will travel again when we are able. We love the Rendezvous hotel and feel for the staff and so many on the islands out of work.Hope for many reasons that this resolves quickly!Edited: 9:13 am, March 19, 2020 "
"Sunnette - of course beaches are all still open, kinda hard to close nature. Please, for the live of all that's holy, reconsider your leisure travel at this time.Jalousiegirl - no one who has been in the UK in the last 14 days is allowed in country (except for very specific circumstances, ie returning nationals and such). Doesn't matter the nationalities of the visitors, it's whether you've been in UK (or any of the other banned countries). Any flights from the UK right now are to evacuate UK nationals. They are not disembarking visitors into St Lucia..."
Thank you Sunnette for the info
"So sad to hear the virus has impacted on St. Lucia too. My thoughts are with all the lovely staff at Rendezvous, and characterful islanders, we met during our wonderful holiday at Christmas.Take care.Cheers ❤️Edited: 12:36 pm, March 19, 2020 "
i just returned last Saturday. We are fine. there were only 2 cases at that time. Where are you staying?
"AprilW: that's great to hear. Glad you're clear. Whom are you asking, if they're OK? As you can see, posts don't embed to whom you're replying to, they just come up next in line.."
Question for trip advisor - why aren’t replies going directly to whom you are directing your response to ?
I'm due to fly tomorrow and BA are still emailing as if it's going ahead!
"MarkUKAs if it’s not bad enough you can’t! Have they offered you a refund? Mines 4 weeks away foreign office advice was No for 30 days, we’re 31.I don’t want a voucher so sitting it out."
"Jackie jYes repaid in full this morning , so took four days Wish you luck in receiving yours x"
Its good to here you got a refund here on this side of the pond its a different story Air Canada Vacations will only offer credit towards a future vacation I think the other canadian tour operators are offering similar credits. Since we paid via credit card the wife decided to start a dispute with the Air Canada Vacations for a refund instead of future credit
token22Good luck They did offer vouchers at first but then superceeded with a full refundCredit to British Airways really Hopefully I shall book with them again when all this over
Update: Royalton and Hideaway at Least will be closing for an undefined length of time as of March 28.
Looking for advice as to St Lucia Sandals Grande. We are presently scheduled to get married at the Grande resort on a trip scheduled to start on May 26th. Should we go ahead and cancel the trip all together or hold out and see where this thing goes. This is a once in a lifetime trip for us. Would hate to miss the trip but also don't want it to turn into a disaster. Traveling from the US. Thanks
Stacy I really feel for you. We just cancelled our Easter vacation to The Royalton and are waiting for hotel / airfare refund/credit. Unfortunately It’s probably the best to cancel / postpone your wedding. Find the most cost effective way if possible. Even if the resort opens they may not be fully staffed or limited excursions island wide etc.
"Yes I agree cancel if you have insurance but you need to review the terms and conditions all that fine print before you cancel. In our case they offered credit if you cancel but if they cancel then you still might get a refund. I find it funny if for any other reason like a heaven forbid hurricane they would just cancel and issue refunds but in this situation they are only offering a credit for future travel. Whos to say 20 months down the road you might need the cash/credit for other things so for now I’d wait it out for a little bit unless you have full coverage insurance which they say will give you a refund. From reading my terms and conditions none of this wasn’t even dreamed of in those conditions. going on in time im sure they will address this but if it lasts 6 months your still under those old terms and conditions nobody knows if the people/company will even exist if you take a credit hopefully you’ve booked with a credit card which does offer some protectionEdited: 11:48 pm, March 20, 2020 "
"Stacy: Sandals is currently only allowing changes/cancellations/etc for bookings through April 30. I'd sit tight, if at all possible and see what the situation is in a week or two.Absolutely no one knows what the world will look like come May. While things may be much more under control, flights, hotels - heck whole countries may be ramping back up, it will take a considerable amount of time to get things back to normal.I'd expect your trip will need to be postponed. However, I'd wait it out for a bit for Sandals to extend their change dates. Good luck, and stay safe ."
"To all that responded, Thank you. Just wanted to give an update. Just got off the phone with the wedding planner. This was a scheduled call date when we booked the trip and not a spontaneous call. She told me that Sandals was closed until May 15 at present time and could change at any time to extend. They were letting people change dates up to a year. I am still in my window of opportunity to cancel without penalty right now or can reschedule. I asked when the majority of people that rescheduled were doing and she told me they were rescheduling for 9 months to a year out. Hope this helps someone. She also told me that phone lines were being shut down and that in order for us to get back in touch that we should email her or one of the other contacts on our list and they would give us a call back. Now to decide what to do. Thanks for everyone's input and help."
Rendezvous and Body Holiday are closed until June first.
"We came to St.Lucia by plane from the US on March 11,2020. After getting to our villa in cap estate we went to rodney bay and found quite a bit going on at the beach and restaurants.As of March 16 the beaches and restaurants have been dead. Were set to leave on March24 and Im getting a little nervous that we wont get a flight out of here and who knows when we will get home."
"Charles P: the US government out out a level 4 travel warning a few days ago, calling for citizens and residents to return home ASAP, or be prepared to stay where you are indefinitely.You need to get on the phone to your airline and get yourself sorted out and home ASAP. Given how quickly governments are shutting countries, and airlines are stopping flights, it's only a matter of time till St Lucia follows suit - you need to be proactive and get yourself going. Unless you plan to stay in St Lucia indefinitely. Good luck, and stay safe. Stacy - glad you've had a good outcome with Sandals. They're decision to close came overnight, give. Jamaica shutting their borders, along with Barbados doing the same, etc. Hope you guys are able to reschedule to a time that suits you. Good luck and stay safe.."
I agree. Get a flight out as soon as you can. My Canadian cousin had to cut short her holiday in the Uk and get back to Toronto before flights got grounded. She made the right decision.
"Jah Bless & Guide tout moun,Saint Lucia will be here after the Storm only different, as will your countries.The Best is Yet to Come!@ Charles P Are you sorted with the airline? Hope you contacted the US Embassy in Barbados..."
Hasn't st Lucia closed all non essential business for two weeks? Wouldn't that include hotels?
"Bon jou jasejase,Yes, and most likely for much longer than expected...St. Lucia Government @SaintLuciaGov 20 March 2020""The Government of Saint Lucia has announced the Implementation of Heightened Protocol and Social Distancing Regime. The measures include a partial scale down of all non-essential activities for a two-week period from March 23 to April 5.""govt.lc/news/statement-on-scale-down-of-non-…Big up! Paul"
"It’s well beyond the time the island needs to be fully locked down. Every day counts. We are in the extra inning of the game. Every hotel, resort, activity that attracts groups, etc. should be shut down like yesterday. Some resorts are staying open to the end of the coming week (likely for an orderly transition period), such as Sandals, but the time has come where having something open that encourages any kind of grouping makes no sense at all.Every case of the infection needs to be tracked to the nth degree with extreme separation and monitoring. The entire focus needs to be on suppression at this stage.Do not travel. If you are somewhere like St Lucia, get home. When you get home, self distance yourself from others and consider getting tested if you can. Every country, island, nation, etc. starts out with this partial scale down approach and then they quickly find that it doesn’t produce the results they need. Be decisive; act fast. Every day counts exponentially. Expect closures to last much longer than first planned."
We're supposed to go to the landings at the end of April. That isn't going to be happening. They haven't asserted anything yet from what I can see. Though their booking shows unavailable till mid may. I have an email into them.
"Effective Tonight, March 23, 2020.""The Government of Saint Lucia announces the closure of Saint Lucia’s airports to all incoming commercial and private flights effective 11:59 p.m. on Monday, March 23, 2020.All airports will be closed to all incoming passengers until Sunday, April 5, 2020.Aircraft facilitating departing passengers repatriating from Saint Lucia will be permitted. Air Cargo operations are permitted.This is part of the government’s efforts to contain the spread or the importation of new cases of COVID-19 (coronavirus).The Government of Saint Lucia has already closed schools, imposed travel restrictions and scaled back non-essential services in an effort contain the disease."""
God bless and protect us all.
"Stay safe....Agree with Rich,,,,God Bless....."
"Today a member of the Sandals staff reached out to me to reschedule one of my two upcoming stays. I completely understand the need to temporarily close the resorts, and I trusted Sandals to handle the situation professionally. When I asked to cancel the reservation since I already have another booking scheduled, I was completely surprised to hear that Sandals will be keeping a portion of my payment. I was informed that I could reschedule my booking for a later date, or I could cancel the booking and lose a portion of my payment. When I asked for 24 hours to discuss this with my wife, I was denied. I was informed that I must answer on the spot. If I chose to take 24 hours to think this through, I would not be able to call a representative of Sandals with an answer. As a customer, I could only wait patiently for another call. If the call came after the 30 day mark from the date of initial arrival for the booking, I would be further penalized financially. It didn't matter that Sandals will not be open, additional money would be forfeit. There was no ETA for when I could speak to a member of the staff again. When I asked to speak to a manager, I was informed that this was not possible. There was no ETA for when a manager could speak with me. If I asked for a callback from the manager, I would run the risk of passing the 30 day mark, meaning further financial penalty. Refusing to fully refund the booking when the resort is closed is unacceptable in and of itself. But informing of you probable financial penalties if you don't have an answer on the spot is unconscionable.This is not the appropriate way to do business."
"Sorry to hear of your experience Sandals, Beaches resort on any island it seems it’s all about $$$$ not customer service ...even before this....Add Rui to the mix too....glad they tent on St Lucia"
They will never be a case of corona virus on any of these islands if would cost them too much money and I can’t believe people still trying to travel still not taking this seriously
Please delete my last reply to this post it was not acurateThanks

"for the person who had the problem with Sandals if you booked with a Credit Card you might want to contact them if sandals is giving you problems It seems a of travel companies are offering ""Credit "" instead of refundsEdited: 5:14 pm, March 30, 2020 "
"Update on situation here:Curfew has been extended, it's now 8pm till 5am.9 confirmed cases, 8 with travel history to infected areas, I with no know travel history, nor contact with someone who had recently traveled. So, apparently, community transmission has begun. We've begun on-island testing and results as of Friday, March 27. Hence the new cases. Over 300 in quarantine at local hotels, mainly those who've returned from Martinique/Dominica, etc last weekend. Liquor licenses suspended indefinitely! That one is surprising. No liquor sales, whether at grocery stores, liquor stores, bars, wherever. Imagine that. Beaches were packed out this past weekend, leading to the expanded curfew times, and serious chastisement from multiple government sources - apparently many of my fellow Luciana think this is all party time and not at all serious. I fear many won't take it seriously till it strikes them directly..Time will tell for us all. Please, for all of us, stay safe out there."
"And things change just that quickly.Results from Monday's testing are in.13 cases now. 10 active, 2 repatriated to their home countries and 1 recovered. Other info stands the same. For now.."
