"We had several bookings in Israel to cancel due to Coronavirus. We are from Canada and were supposed to travel to Israel in Oct-Nov 2020. We are in our late 60s and early 70s and decided to cancel our trip as some of us have health issues (respiratory). We believe it would be in the best interest of the world to not travel within the next year specifically with our age and health issues.In this particular post, I want to talk about Tourist Israel. This is the only company that did not revised their refund policy. I want to warn travelers that this company will not use common sense when dealing with your booking1-) We booked a 2-night (3-day) Petra & Wadi Rum trip from Eilat on Jan 14, 2020 for Oct 12, 2020.2-) On March 22, we sent an email explaining why we had to cancel. We respectfully asked all monies to be reimbursed due to this extraordinary event. This would mean Tourist Israel would not keep a 5% handling fee (5% of $918= $45.90 US).3-) They stated they would refund the monies but not the 5% handling fee.4-) After several emails, a supervisor emailed me stating “Ms. Vegh brought to my attention your frustration about the remaining 5% of the refund. As mentioned by Noa, the 5% is indeed an external fee that I have no power to waive”. Really!!!!!!5-) To be fair to them, I have to write that they offered us a complimentary tour in Israel whenever we choose to arrive. The supervisor added “This complimentary tour is worth more than the 5% remaining balance, so you can be sure that if we could waive it, we would”.6-) I had explained very well that it was unacceptable as all other companies (Airbnb — Arkia Airlines — all other bookings at different hotel sites) had reimbursed us without penalty (Airbnb: it was a non-refundable booking and the owner in Haifa could have kept the $$ and Airbnb could have kept their handling fee but did not). I mentioned I would warn other travellers on Tripadvisor.7-) I believe it is why they offered us a free tour.8-) We declined as we have values!Through this ordeal, we learned to: -NEVER book early. There was no rush of us to book in January for an October tour. But I am organized and wanted everything in place.-NEVER book anything involving non-refundable/handling fee (even a small portion). We can not believe such a good size company dealing with their customers without integrity and compassion. It is why it was important for us to warn others. We have thanked Arkia Airlines for their compassion and that we will never forget how they treated us. Well, we needed to post this post as we will never forget how Tourist Israel treated us. Two different companies with different values! The Canadians!"
"Tourist Israel has a very bad reputation. Contact your credit card provider ( yes I know phone lines for Canadian banks/ credit card providers are lengthy) or make an online objection to a charge.If you have not yet been charged then you will have to monitor your credit card transactions and object as soon as you are charged.Stat Safe Another Canadian!Edited: 12:29 pm, April 03, 2020 "
Stay safe ( not stat safe)
"Thank you for your response.I was charged on Jan 14 and it was posted on Jan 15 on my credit card. I already have contacted my credit card company but they are saying that I have to wait 15 business days before I can dispute the charge. I have only time in my hands so I don't mind waiting over 1 hour on the line to talk to my credit card company.I will have to call them back on April 10, wait another hour and then dispute this charge.I would have hoped not to have to do these unnecessary actions... but some companies ONLY think on $$$$ like Tourist Israel.The Canadians!"
"We lost a 10% handling fee for a trip to Petra from Jerusalem that we canceled for May from a different company NOT Tourist Israel. Honestly I was not upset, I felt blessed that I only lost 10%."
"I think there is a good chance your credit card provider will cancel the charge once you dispute it. I have only taken 2 day tours in Israel and both times I booked the day before.I would not even think of any travel for several months until things markedly improve with respect to the pandemic.Most/ all of us have/are losing monies ( some significant)due to the collapsing economy/ pandemic.As stated the most important thing is that we and our families/friends and everyone remain in good health.Edited: 7:01 pm, April 03, 2020 "
"I’m sorry but I see this differently, even though I know Tourist Israel has a bad reputation on other matters.My husband and I (seniors with health issues) planned to travel to t he UK and Israel in April/May. We waited until Cathay Pacific were offering refunds for our travel dates before applying so that we would not incur a cancellation fee. Our travel agent informed us that despite getting the refund d from Cathay Pacific we will be losing certain fees connected with booking our flights, even though the flight cost itself is going to be refunded to us (we are waiting for it to appear in our accounts). The fees we will be losing amount to about $500 and we should get half of that back from our travel insurance. One of those fees is what the travel agent would be paid. Are they to be paid nothing for their work in researching fares, booking them, and then spending time on the phone organising the cancellation? I don’t expect that at all.To be honest I don’t think Tourist Israel are being unreasonable. They need to live too. They did the administration for you in making the booking and again in cancelling it. Are they to be paid nothing for the work they have done for you? If you got the main amount back then be very thankful. If there are fees that are not covered from the, and other places you have booked, then add them up and see whether it’s worth claiming from your travel insurance.Edited: 10:05 pm, April 03, 2020 "
"I should add that travelling in Oct/Nov is outside the time range that current refunds are being given for the Corona Virus problem. Usually refunds aren’t made until the Company knows that they are not able to provide the service. You are outside those dates by a long way. For all we know st the present time, the airlines could be flying again and the tour might proceed so you are not actually cancelling at the moment for anything other than personal reasons (which I fully understand as I’m in the same position exactly.) If you had waited to cancel until it was clear that they were not able to supply the tour then I would agree that you should get 100% back."
I totally agree with Heather's posts.
"While I now understand Heather 's and others point Tourist Israel makes it's living greatly in part by cheating others by collecting monies for shuttles that dont show up (ie) Flo/ Eilat Shuttle so for this reason they should refund the 5 %.I feel the same about the airlines many who will be bailed out by their respective governments to avoid bankruptcy such as El Al, Air Canada , Cathay Pacific and many others.So I encourage all to try not to pay a penny.Edited: 1:23 pm, April 04, 2020 "
"I totally understand your frustration and also your concern and caution that has led you to cancel your trip so far in advance. That is your choice.I have no connection with Tourist Israel and for that matter I don't even know for a fact that they and Flo Shuttle are the same company.Yes, they have acquired a not so great reputation here on the forum - however, when you booked with them you knew what their terms were -- they do not hide their cancellation fees. Your tour was not cancelled by them, your flights were not cancelled making it impossible for you to get to your tour -- the cancellation was your choice (regardless of the reasons) and they have agree to cancel and to refund everything but the 5% fee which was clearly spelled out.It was very nice of Air BnB, Arkia and others to provide a full refund - they went above and beyond - and that is great - but you cannot fault a company for adhering to the contract you signed with them.I know that the situation now (and for months to come) is very unusual and will cause all sorts of unique issues to deal with but - to dispute a charge with your credit card company when no one has done anything wrong is simply unfair and IMHO not the right thing to do."
"Since this is a Petra tour they are obviously working with a Jordanian tour/bus company and Jordanian guides. If they advanced money to the Jordanians, perhaps they cannot get a refund from them?"
"Heather is absolutely correct. Right now everything is canceled in Israel for the foreseeable future, or at least until the end of Apri. There is no reason to expect a company to absorb their handling fees for everyone who decides to cancel due to the chance that maybe the situation will not change between now and the expected date of travel. This small amount to you multiplied by hundreds and perhaps thousands of people can make a company go bankrupt. It is for this type of situation that people take out travelers insurance. Moral of the story -- do not pay everything upfront in advance when it is not only necessary but also so far in advance. One never knows what the future will bring. Put a deposit if necessary. ChanaIsrael"
"As a person whose income has not been affected by this pandemic, I am reluctant to criticize and judge anyone whose income has gone down to zero and charges a nominal and reasonable cancelation fee for work already done. They have offered you a free tour as compensation, which is more than fair."
"""The Employment Service released a report on Sunday, stating that 70% of workers in the southern city of Eilat, were either fired, or forced to take an unpaid leave due the coronavirus epidemic that halted the city's thriving tourism industry."""
