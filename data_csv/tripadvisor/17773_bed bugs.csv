Has ever had a problem with bed bugs in these hotels?Milan-Hotel Casa MiaVenice-Istituto San Giuseppe -monasteryFlorence-Leonardo House - hostelStressa- Du Parc Hotel
Why would you expect bed bugs?
"I have heard that there is an epidemic of bed bugs in hotels and that if they are carried home in your suitcases, they can infest your home. I know two people who brought bed bugs home with them. It was a nightmare to get rid of them."
"Oh dear. ""I have heard"" almost always seems to lead up to some extraordinary piece of misinformation. There is no epidemic of bed bugs. I have been following the Italian forums since 2007, and there has not been one first-hand report of bed bugs."
Bed bugs get a lot of press in the US in all levels of hotels. Here is one site dedicated to reports.http://bedbugregistry.com/ I spend 3 to 5 months a year in Italy and have not run into them yet. My only experience of them was in Nepal. There was one hotel review of a hotel in Florence that convinced me to look elsewhere.TABEdited: 8 years ago
