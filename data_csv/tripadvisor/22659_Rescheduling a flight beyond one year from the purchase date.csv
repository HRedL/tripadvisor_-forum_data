"Hello. We have a long anticipated trip to Europe coming up on June 1. I haven’t been very concerned about the coronavirus, but I’ve been reading some recent articles that it is expected to peak in May or June which of course would impact us greatly. We purchased these tickets on September 2. For various reasons we cannot reschedule until the middle of September, I’m thinking the whole virus problem will have calmed down by then and it’s also the next time we are able to fly. But middle of September is a couple of weeks beyond the one year anniversary of our purchase date. I know that if you cancel a flight the credit is only for one year from the purchase date, does anyone know if this applies to a reschedule as well? It’s an international flight if that helps. I’ve been trying to get a hold of United Airlines to ask this question, but with everything going on there hold times are very long. If anyone knows the answer to this I would deeply appreciate it. Thanks so much"
I don’t think there is a specific answer to this in light of the coronavirus. Some airlines and cruise lines are modifying their normal cancellation/change policies. They will likely continue to modify as needed as we all see what happens with coronavirus in the coming months.
"Thank you. It is such a moving target right now. I really wasn’t concerned at all, I really felt the whole thing would blow over by June, but now I’m not so sure and with $2000 in airline tickets at stake I want to see if I could salvage something. I guess I’ll have to wait and be patient like the rest of us. What crazy times we are living in. I always figured that since we travel frequently that some major trip would be ruined by illness or an accident or a terrorist attack even, but a pandemic never occurred to me, LOL. Life is what happens when you’re making other plans."
"Hello again. I somehow managed to get a hold of United Airlines and got good news, because they made some schedule changes from our originally booked flight, they said that if we needed to we could cancel and reschedule that flight without change fees and we could reschedule for after one year from the date of purchase. So that’s really good news for us, and hopefully if anybody else is in the same situation, look if United made any changes to your original schedule because that’s a workaround for rescheduling with no fee or limitation."
I know what you mean. We have a trip booked to San Francisco next month and to London in September. We still plan to do both unless there is a big change in conditions due to coronavirus.
It’s great that the travel providers are modifying their normal policies in response to the uncertainty of this virus. It’s costing them a lot of money.
