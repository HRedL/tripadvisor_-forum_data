"Tarik, you made me laugh! Thanks for that too.I can not believe, why should they opose? It is very useful definitely, so thanks again!!!!"
Sadly our flight to Split on the 18th June has been cancelled. This was an extra special holiday of 17 days going back to Vis and Hvar in two favourite apartments. It took this situation to stop us travelling. Very sad and disappointed. Especially hard coming after losing my dad last year and having worked throughout I am in desperate need of a break. But not to be.
"Unfortunately I can't change my rostered holiday at work. Had we booked for July I think we would have been all right, as it stands we are two weeks too early very unluckily. All indications are is that the quarantine will be dropped early July so that wouldn't bother me at all. We would have been flying back on the 4th.Edited: 4:59 pm, June 11, 2020 "
I have been very tempted into trying to get alternative flights. I have looked at wizzair from Luton. The insurance however would be invalidated as at this moment would still be travelling against foreign office advice. I am not really prepared to take that risk. I might for myself but my partner is slightly more vulnerable in health.
"So sorry Rosebrid! Wish we could help, definitely many plans distorted this year.I dont think anybody could have ever imagined this could happen.I hope you could find some solution, good luck and stay safe."
"Thank you so much for this information! I am a bit confused though because I am reading it that people from non EU countries....including me from the USA....can come as long as we have proof of accommodation. But then I see that Tarik...who I trust completely and is very helpful...is saying hopefully people from the USA can HOPEFULLY be allowed to enter after July 1. Can someone who fully understands please clarify for me? Sorry I just don't fully get it and with our balance due on our trip due July 5, we are cutting it close time wise."
Tarik- thanks for that. I guess I will have to wait and see until July 1 then go from there. It’s nerve wracking not knowing if we will be able to go or not! I think I’ll try to come up with a plan B In case we are unable to go to Croatia this summer.
"Tarik- We are thinking that if we can not get to Croatia, we will see if we can change our flights and go to Greece instead. Will wait and see through the end of this month and then we will have to make a decision! I was at my Dr's this morning for a routine check and we are both avid travelers and we were saying how it stinks that we need to be lumped into 1 group as a whole in the US as our county has had very little cases of COVID19."
"Tarik- Thanks for the heads up. Maybe we will just have to not travel to Europe this summer. It will be a bummer, but what can we do? We aren't the only people in this boat unfortunately."
"Thanks for the info. We have a home in Fazana, Istria. We will travel by car from the UK on 22nd June. I have downloaded the form & pre registered for entry Into Croatia from the Slovenian border. Thanks again, this will save us time. We obviously love Croatia & Croatians!"
Going to Spilt airport on saturday next and staying in Lusea Apts. What can I expect from the airport and the apartment? Any comments would help especially for someone with walking difficulty. Can you hire Moblity Scooters?Many Thanks
