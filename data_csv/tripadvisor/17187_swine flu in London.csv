How bad are things with swine flu in London? How many swine flu cases are counted in London area? Should we be worried? Should we take extra measures about our trip? Has anyone been in London lately so tell us about the current situation? Media here in Greece are going crazy about swine flu in Uk. What is really happening?
"HiAbout 60 million people live in the UK and, to date, there are about 4,000 cases of swine flu. As far as I am aware, there have been two fatalities and press reports suggest that this is currently a mild strain of flu virus.In contrast, our usual (winter) seasonal flu tends to kill several thousand vulnerable people.If you would like to monitor the situation try this site:www.direct.gov.uk/en/Swineflu/DG_177831I am tempted to say that you are more likely to forget that our traffic drives on the ""wrong side of the road"", than you are to contract the virus. No need to panic at the moment!"
"Theres swine flu all over the world now, that's why it's now been defined as a pandemic.Greece has had 86 cases.Here's the latest story I can find about it in the UK:…bbc.co.uk/1/…8122910.stmWhat extra measures would you take? "
"Yes, there have been two fatal cases where the victims were elderly and already suffering from serious existing health issues. The standard influenza virus has killed many more victims than swine flu has this year. If you contract swine flu as a fit and well, healthy adult, the worst that will happen is you will feel unwell for a few days. But other than the odd Japanese tourist wearing face maks, life goes on as usual and tens of thousands are enjoying their holiday as normal. "
"well, greek media love drama. They are saying that people in uk airports and tube wear masks and gloves! "
"A Greek media melodrama! I'm in and out of London and it's airports every week and I've not seen anyone wearing gloves and masks, apart from half a dozen Japanese tourists at Gatwick airport.The two fatalaties were both in Scotland anyhow."
> How bad are things with swine flu in London? < I see no difference to usual.> How many swine flu cases are counted in London area? < 289 as at 19th June. No deaths.> Should we be worried? <I don't think so.> Should we take extra measures about our trip? <I don't think so.
I m sooo glad to read your answers. I dont want anything to mess my trip to London. I count the days and hours till I m there!You are very helpfull thank you..
"Hey hary53, i am going to London too in to weeks and had the same worries. Especially after hearing all the time about people coming from UK with the flu. I asked my doctor too and was told that if i am a little careful it should be ok (washing hands frequently etc). I asked some friends of mine who live in London and said it is a minor issue there so I have decided to go and i hope i will not have any problems. "
"> washing hands <The virus is airborne, so that will make little difference."
"reading panosath post and mine you can understand how misleading greek media are...In the last days if I say to someone I m going to London in a few days they reply ""are out of your mind? You will get the flu!"" "
"Greenwich Nick - I understood the washing hands advice to arise from helping prevent a scenario where a person sneezes into their hand, touches a door handle, then you touch it, then touch your own face. Anyway - there is absolutely no difference whatsoever in daily life because of swine flu in London - more people will sadly die next week because of the high temps forecast than the swine flue.0.004% of London's population has been infected by Swine Flu - errrrr - I think there is nothing to worry about for now."
Here's the government tv advert:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmYjFmQI5KAMind you it's common sense for colds as well as flu (says Kevin having just got over a bad cold)
"Regarding the comment about washing hands:It is a very important thing to do not only for swine flu but for all types of flu and other virus. The main way to get the virus is your mouth, nose and eyes and this can happen if you touch them with your hands. The virus can be in the air about 1 meter around the infected person but since it is heavy it will drop. So it is most possible to touch somewhere and get it with your hands. "
Haven't seen a single mask being worn in Scotland. As much as the media like to hype it up its kinda become a non-story for the time being.I would love to think that everyone keeps their hands regularly washed and not just when any kind of flu or other lurgy strikes. Tsk tsk to the poster who said it wouldn't make any difference!
"> tsk tsk to the poster who said it wouldn't make any difference <I guess I am ""the poster"" that is aimed at. If it's airborne, washing your hands isn't going to make much difference."
"<<< If it's airborne, washing your hands isn't going to make much difference. >>>It can also be transmitted by touch - thus the advice to sneeze into a disposable hankie or your sleeve (generations of little boys were right) rather than your hands "
I did see someone wearing a facemask on the tube last Monday but he looked like a tourist.
"The UK has had its third swine flu death:""A nine-year-old girl has died at Birmingham Children's Hospital after contracting swine flu.The hospital said the girl, *****who had other underlying health problems*****, had died in the past few days."" [my emphasis]…bbc.co.uk/1/…8124781.stm"
"hi,im so concerned too because in a month my family will be going to london,my ticket is non refundable so i cant jsut cancel it.said in the mth of august 100 thousand cases a day in england,i hope its just an over estimation.hows london right now?is it really that worst therre?"
"coteazur, if you would like to see London in the midst of a serious epidemic, you should visit the Museum of London. There is a wonderful exhibit of London during the time of the Black Plague - the 1660s.Right now, people are not dropping in the streets, nor are they ringing handbells and shouting 'unclean! unclean!' whilst walking along the pavements. Influenza - including H1N1 - can be a serious illness, especially for those who are immunocompromised for any reason or have co-morbidities. This strain has been of interest since a certain number of healthy people with no other health problems have died, but (thankfully) they have been the exception rather than the rule.Handwashing is crucial to infection control at all times - the boffins at the hospital where I work have been telling us to wash our hands more frequently for many years. Given the great number of fomites available for the virus, handwashing is the best and easiest first line defence for all of us.Enjoy your visit to London."
"DON'T PANIC Mr Mainwaring, DON'T PANIC - the sky isn't falling.The level of panic for something which for 99.99% of the people in the UK is nothing worse than a week's worth of sniffles is astounding is quite astounding. God forbid anything serious happening like a bomb 3000 miles away "
"After the statement about 100,000 cases my trip is really messed up!I ve got a 4 month old baby and I worried about giving the flu to him. Would you go to the trip if you were me? "
"<<I've got a 4 month old baby and I worried about giving the flu to him. Would you go to the trip if you were me? >>If there really are 100,000 cases a week* in the UK in just a few weeks time, which sounds ridiculous to me given how many there are in Mexico, (barely none) which should be months ahead of the UK, then there will be the same levels in Greece also, unless Greece is hermetically sealed off from the UK /rest of the world? Its not as if there is some special thing in the UK that makes us more susceptible.*This figure came from a government minister. In the same week, another government minister said that 300,000 people were losing their passports (in just one town in the UK) **every single week**. Multiply that up by towns and there are more passports being lost in a week than people that have passports. IMO both figures are equally credible."
"<< I ve got a 4 month old baby and I worried about giving the flu to him. Would you go to the trip if you were me >>If it was me, I'd leave the baby with a relative.(That's nothing to do with swine flu, just thinking about whether the kid would enjoy the trip. Airports, planes, ears popping, traffic fumes...the poor mite)"
I see we've started dieing of it now.
I m not taking the kid with me. I m worried about what will happen when I come back.
"Well, hary, the safe thing to do would be to stay away from your baby during the incubation period. 2 weeks?"
"This is a pattern we have seen in recent years. The Government predicts the worst, then when it turns out not to be quite so bad the Government claims credit for the 'resolute action' that prevented the worst. "
"<<Well, hary, the safe thing to do would be to stay away from your baby during the incubation period. 2 weeks?>>Indeed, and you should do that in Greece as well obviously. So, start every day 'I might have contracted SF today in Greece, stay away from baby for two weeks from today. Next day, start again."
"<<< Well, hary, the safe thing to do would be to stay away from your baby during the incubation period. 2 weeks? >>>They should stay away from everyone for 2 weeks ""just in case"" unless they want to become the Greek equivalent of Patient Zero"
"Re; handwashing. As an NHS employee, I have (as should all staff by now) completed Pandemic Flu training. The flu virus (of all kinds) can remain alive on non-porous surfaces (e.g., metal door handles) for up to 48 hours, and on porous surfaces for up to 24 hours. Touch it, then for example bite your nails or eat with your hands, and you are vulnerable. So handwashing is an essential part of good flu hygiene. Having said that, London is not stressed about swine flu. No-one is wearing masks on the tube, in fact, people have even stopped looking askance at those who sneeze or sniff. We are far more interested in Andy Murray failing to reach the finals of Wimbledon and Michael Jackson. Swine flu struggles to reach the top of the news bulletins.Enjoy your holiday and don't worry!"
"And soon it'll be the Ashes & The Open and once they are over it's time for the footie, so Swine Flu will be on the backburner"
Thanks for your advice Gaby. My main concern is my baby and I certainly couldnt keep away from him for a long time. A week away to London is already too much for me being a new mom. But its a trip I ve been planning for a long long time and I hope I dont have any problems.
"Completely understand you wanting to be sure with a new baby- everything can be scary! Just take routine precautions, seek health advice if you do feel ill, and above all enjoy your trip and try not to miss your little one too much. "
"Hi, I´m in same situation. I´ve paid a non refund trip to London in July 17th for 10 days (Air tickets and Hotels). Until yesterday we actually decided to go after hear comments in trip advisor. But today I am thinking seriously about it. It seems people in London are facing as normal flu. But it will be very bad take this flu and be isolated in hospital / hotel. I will follow the news tomorrow and after tomorrow how the flu is growing in London. "
"No-one is isolated in hotels in the UK. A very few people are in hospital.Most people are told to stay away from work or school for a week. And if the government forecasts are correct (which I doubt), then there may be 100,000 flu cases each week. How do you isolate 100,000 people per week?We could send tham all to St Kilda in the Atlantic, but I can't see that working either.Please note, I am not deriding you or your question. It's a serious issue, and not to be ignored.BUT - it has to been taken IN CONTEXT. It is not the plague or the Ebola virus."
"And if you're really that worried don't come.Also you'd better not go to any capital cities in your own country, not go to anywhere that has any people as you don't know where they've been, really you might as well not leave your house if you want to be REALLY sure. But in your own room so you don't interact with any members of your family who could have been in contact with someone else.Yes that's exceptionally flippant but I don't see people worrying about visiting London each year when the normal flu ravages the UK (and the rest of Europe). What about the heatwaves? Don't go to France as more people died there than anywhere else when it was hot the other year? If you are really really really worried don't come. Sounds like you are really worried so will just be scared all the time. Oh........ I've just seen why the Greek media are going mental about the UK, some of their swine flu victims were students in the UK returning home."
"The first reported cases of Swine Flu in Greece were actually people coming from the US. There have subsequently been cases reported in people coming from the UK and Germany. The majority of the more recent cases haven't been in people returning from anywhere, but are people who've stayed in Greece."
The news report I read said that at least 3 of the first few cases were students studying in the UK so I can certainly see how the UK was demonised by the Greek media.
"No, the first case was someone who'd been in the States. http://www.xpatathens.com/news/19994The same story (and other more recent statistics) comes up if you google something like 'swine flu greece', but I thought I'd let a Greek site have the honours! "
"There has been talk in the papers here of ""swine flu parties"" where parents take their children in the hope of catching a mild dose of swine flu now to give you some immunity when it mutates. That isn't actually recommended and the parties probably haven't happened. However you can see that the attitude here is that if your children are otherwise healthy it it's no big deal and might even be useful.So - the only precautions people are taking are to get in extra supplies of alcohol nd chocolate in case they need cheering up for a few days. In summer viruses don't survive as long on all those surfaces. We have large stocks of drugs if you do need treatment. It's not a reason to cancel your holiday. I was worried about the risk of picking up swine flu on holiday, it's now in my children's school. It will soon be worldwide anyway. "
"Summer doesn't matter that much to some infective agents; that pesky little Hepatitis B virus can live in dried blood on fomites such as IV poles or door handles for up to five days, winter and summer.Infectious diseases are all around us; as easily as there may be 100 people exposed to H1N1 who will become ill to some extent there may also be 100 people who will be exposed and have only mild signs and symptoms of disease.With ease of travel and the speed with which people travel, it's a fair bet that H1N1 had made its way halfway or more around the world by the time the first case was diagnosed and is still on the move to some extent.Antivirals shouldn't be taken as a matter of course if one thinks one has H1N1, but should be prescribed only after careful assessment by one's physician. And remember to wash your hands frequently!"
"Hary, as a resident of Greece I wouldn't worry more in London than I do in Athens (I don't worry at all).Since I see you mention your baby, I will tell you this: a friend's mother went to London last week. My friend has a 3-year old boy and she told her mother to wear a mask on the plane and not to kiss her boy for a week after she gets back. When I asked her ""why a week?"" she didn't have a convincing reply.IMO, this is ridiculous. I didn't see anyone wearing masks in case they caught ""a"" flu, so why do it with this one? Not to mention removing the mask to eat and drink, right? Or will she hold her breath while eating and drinking?My advice would be to go, have fun, wash your hands often (something that you should do anyway) and don't worry. We have plenty of cases in Athens as well and I don't see anyone staying at home because of that! :-)"
> So handwashing is an essential part of good flu hygiene. <With what?
Ah - here's a useful resource:…europa.eu/en/…Pop_advice_090503.pdf
"BTW, Hary, my uncle is an epidimiologist (sp?) professor in Harvard and he is quit often interviewed for the Greek telly (if you haven't guessed who he is, I can PM you his name). He is not-even-slightly worried. He is busy, tired but very optimistic and hasn't put us off our future travels around Europe. "
"well, as I said my only concern is my baby. He is only 4 months old. You can give medicine to a 3 year old kid but with babies things are difficult.Anyway my final decision is to go to London but try to get more on buses and less on trains and tube where is very crowded at rush hour. I always thought that getting aroud with buses is much better for tourists as you can see more of the city.Wash my hands a lot and take some antibacterial products with me. I m not going to wear a mask so you could spot me haha!"
"> ...try to get more on buses and less on trains and tube where is very crowded at rush hour. <Buses are also very crowded at rush hour.> I always thought that getting aroud with buses is much better for tourists as you can see more of the city. <I agree. You see so much more from a bus.> ...and take some antibacterial products with me. I m not going to wear a mask so you could spot me haha! <As influenza is a virus anti-bacterial products will be ineffective.Of course you're concerned but come to London and enjoy yourself. Wash your hands (as I'm sure you would be doing normally).I'm travelling today. I have to catch the Underground at rush hour then sit on a train for 4 hours. Of all the issues that I've considered, flu isn't one of them."
"> > So handwashing is an essential part of good flu hygiene. <With what?<Using a tissue to catch the sneeze, and throwing it away promptly. It's not rocket science, it's standard good hygiene at all times anyway."
"<<I always thought that getting aroud with buses is much better for tourists as you can see more of the city.>>I also agree! You get an overview and you discover places that you wouldn't if travelling underground. Many shops, bars and restaurants that I now often visit are ""discoveries"" I made while riding the London buses!"
I've yet to find any bars or restaurants on the tube))) Not a bad Idea though... they should convert some of the unused ghost stations (like The Strand & The British Museum) to nightclubs. That'd be fun.
"> > > So handwashing is an essential part of good flu hygiene. <With what?<Using a tissue to catch the sneeze, and throwing it away promptly. It's not rocket science, it's standard good hygiene at all times anyway. <I was asking what you are recommending we wash our hands with to kill the virus."
"Soap and water, Nick. Really, it seems very simplistic and almost a swizz, but soap interrupts the cell wall membrane of some organisms and inactivates others. Soap may not destroy viruses or fungi but it can certainly slow them down, especially those with a lipid coat.It's not the answer to everything but it has been one of the core components of infection control for a long, long time."
I'm ashamed to admit it as it's rather un-macho but I like that hand disenfectant stuff you can buy. It's a gel that you rub into your hands and it evaporates. I don't use it against swine flu I just like the cooling feeling when it evaporates...
"FWIW, the alcohol in the hand sanitizers also disrupts cell membranes of bacteria, and lipid envelopes of viruses. So there is some bacteriocidal and virucidal activity there.Actually, the soap and water is more mechanical than anything - you physically remove the ""germs"" from your hands and send them down the drain. So even washing your hands WITHOUT soap is much better than doing nothing.Yes, sneezing into a tissue and disposing of it is a good idea, but are you absolutely sure your hands didn't get contaminated? So I'd still follow up with washing if at all possible (or hand sanitizing).This IS my field of expertise, and having said all that, we arrive in London tomorrow, and I'm not worried about catching swine flu and I won't be obsessively washing my hands. I'll try not to get sneezed or coughed on while on the tube, but there's not a lot you can do to protect yourself. Unless you want to be the one wearing a mask. A mask would, no doubt, clash with my white trainers.If anyone is feeling ill, however, everyone would appreciate it if they would stay home if at all possible! ;-)Cybored"
"CHeers, Cybored. My understanding is that there's currently no strong evidence that alcohol cleanser are very effective against virus in general or influenza in particular - am I just out of date on that?Presumably the soap with which one washes one's hands needs to be squirting dispenser stuff, otherwise the virus just continues to multiply on warm, wet soap bar that has been put back on the sink?And what happens to all the virus cells that get washed down the sink?"
"I agree with Cybored that there's no much you can do to protect yourself, I managed to pick up chicken pox last year (I'm in my 30s) and I can only assume that it was from the tube or trains as none of my friends or people I work with had chicken pox, nor did any of them know anybody else who did. All I know is that I woke up with the pox one morning, so must have picked it up from some stranger in passing - case of the wrong place at the wrong time for me, but what can you doAlso agree with the soap lysing the cell structure of organisms, my background is science and I worked in micro labs for a few years. Was also taught that the mechanical washing, ie scrubbing your hands can also disrupt the cell structure, as can very hot water"
Someone at work has just had it and came back to work today right as rain.
"Varicella is a tough little beggar, and younger adults (lucky you!) are more susceptible than older. You will have been in contact with someone who was infectious, but it can take from ten to 21 days for symptoms to appear. Hope the scratching wasn't too severe.stemplar, we stil use isopropanol based hand gel at the hospital where I work. It's a good fast extra clean for hands after washing - but we've had more than a few problems with some of our more, erm, needy patients making off with the dispensers and drinking the stuff. Not a good thing, but it happens."
"Yes, IPA dispensers made their appearance when MRSA came under the spotlight a few years ago, and I'm well used to using those when going onto a ward. Back to having to do it again now while we see whether my father is finally on the way out."
I ll try to wash my hands as often as possible but being a tourist this means I have to use a public tap which isnt always a good thing. 
"So there aren't people wheeling carts up and down London streets while shouting ""Bring out your dead""?"
Public loos in London are spotless clean. Get some Microbend wipes from your local chemist (or some antibacterial ones from Boots) in case you can't find a loo to wash your hands and you'll be fine.
"Metro,Whilst I think the media have fanned the panic, I do think your comment is not in good taste - news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/8137115.stm"
"I am a news junkie and rarely hear anything in the US about the Swine Flu in the UK...not any more so than any other country, anyway. "
"Peterscot,You are right. I was trying to poke fun at the media but my joke didn't quite work. My apologies."
"<<So there aren't people wheeling carts up and down London streets while shouting ""Bring out your dead""?>>Only after Millwall FC games :-)"
Am I the only one worried about Swine Flu and travelling to London?

<<< Am I the only one worried about Swine Flu and travelling to London? >>>Yes 
"Yesterday's Evening Standard newspaper (""the paper that loves to hate London"") has headlines of ""London on verge of swine flu epidemic""."
"> Am I the only one worried about Swine Flu and travelling to London? <Yes.Well, probably not. But it's a non-issue. If you're so worried don't come. Clearly knowledge of the situation isn't reassuring you."
"Anecdotal chit chat suggests that many Londoners have already had SF in mild version - sore throat, raised temps, coughs & sneezes etc.Many Londoners also concerned about maintaining currrent employment status & so unlikely to forego opportunity to present self at coal face on evidential basis of the some intermittant coughing/sneezing or discomfort relieved by a proprietary cold medication......So Keeping Calm & Carrying On is the message du jour.20/20 hindsight in months to come could prove this hypothesis wrong, but for now KC&CO."
"<<Am I the only one worried about Swine Flu and travelling to London?>>Possibly one of the few. Are you worried about living in Athens, or wherever else you live in Greece? "
"Mrs Chimp woke up this morning complaining of flu-like symptoms. Phoned the Drs surgery and was told ""with those symptoms it's better to be safe than sorry so stay away from work for 5 days and take normal flu remedies.""If they include all of the people who are like this in their 100,000 figures then it's no wonder the figures are as big as they are."
"That's something I've been wondering about too, Chimp. Are all those people who ring up their doctor's surgery saying they've got the sniffles recorded as possible Swine Flu cases? And what about those who always make the most of any flu epidemic to take a few days off work? ('I rang my doctor's surgery and they told me not to come into work for a few days'). It's just possible that the number of cases in the UK is a reflection of the way the health service works here. Are people in countries where treatment or advice is not free at the point of service as likely to be so quick to make contact with official channels? This must surely affect the figures in different countries. "
True!If you have any symptoms at all in Greece you go to the hospital and they run blood tests.
"In Ireland you’ve got to pay about E50 for a trip to the GP, people tend to stay away unless they’re on their last legs. Funnily enough the reports of swine flu in Ireland seem to be quite low so far :-O"
Samr here. But if you have swine flu symptoms and you go to a public hospital (not a GP) then they will examine you and -if needed- test you.
"And unless you are an ""at-risk"" person - compromised health/immune etc all you will achieve is likely to infect a bunch of people on the way or at the hospital. Swine-flu has beeb declared pandemic (stage 6) in Greece so not sure that your risks are that different unless you stay at home and hide under the bed (which is an option).I'm heading to London in two weeks and swine flu is not a worry nor will I be taking any precautions. Just enjoy your trip."
"seems like it isn't a major concern for most.but being pregnant and travelling is worrying enough. and now coupled with travelling to London where H1N1 is spreading rapidly, i really wonder if being extra careful by wearing a N95 mask is goanna help me.I'm heading to London tomorrow from Singapore.Hubby aint too keen on wearing a N95 mask throughout coz he dont wanna look silly. But yet at the same time, if he's infected, he might spread it to me and i'm already 28wks pregnant and really worried about how H1N1 will affect my baby.*sigh*Will people stereotype me and my hubby as some weirdo when we wear N95 mask on London streets???Or do the pregnant ladies in London also take extra precaution like me?"
"<< Will people stereotype me and my hubby as some weirdo when we wear N95 mask on London streets???Or do the pregnant ladies in London also take extra precaution like me? >>They might give you some funny looks and you will definitely stand out as ""unusual"". I'm not sure about pregnant ladies wearing masks but if it's that important to you don't worry about anyone else.(I have a suspicion that if you do wear one when you arrive you may well discard it soon after because you will be one in a million ... almost literally) "
If you are 28 weeks pregnant then you have -hopefully- let your doctor know of your trip. Just follow whatever instructions he/she gave you and you'll be fine.
"volks_tsy - you need to decide whether the risks are any different at home or in London, and also if you are comfortable with the care you would receive wherever you happen to be (for any medical complication not just the flu)- the UK has excellent medical facilities.There would seem to be some possible risk - www.parentcentral.ca/parent/article/664077 but you need to be comfortable in your own decision."
"There is an awful lot of hype surrounding swine flu which really is only a bad strain of a cold or a mild strain of flu.Most of the people dying from swine flu had co-morbities making them far more susceptible to the H1N1 virus. This is exactly what happens every year with any strain of flu.Swine flu has had an awful lot of unneccesary air time in the press. Go on your holiday, relax and enjoy!! If you get flu like symptoms, stay indoors, keep up your fluids, take paracetamol and if it all gets too much, seek medical advice or go to a hospital."
"thanks for the link...Of course i trust the healthcare in London but just don't wanna take the risk of risking my unborn child.Most people would advise me to stay away from crowded areas.but really...how on earth am i suppose to avoid going to shopping centre when its LONDON SUMMER SALES!!!geeBack here in Singapore, H1N1 (swine flu) is also kinda bad...but i'm a stay home mom thus i dont have much issue on that.And over here in Singapore, the bosses/managers are real paranoid when someone starts coughing/sneezing or running a high fever in the office.Many of my ex colleagues were told to stay at home for 7 days to play safe. And even if it's a mild cough, we were told to wear a mask."
"The N95 masks are designed more to prevent the wearer from distributing his or her organisms than to stop influx of organisms.And unless one is fit tested - which takes about 15 minutes to do correctly, as we have it done at the hospital every year - there's not a lot of protection offered by an ill-fitting mask."
"Thanks for clarifying the mask situation TravellerPlus.The paper type masks sold in pharmacies are no protection to you; they protect others from you :-) They quickly become moist from your breathing and become useless as barrier for you.Boy, the drugstores have made a ton recently from sales of those masks. Good for the economy anyway!"
"Hary, >am i the only one worried about swine flu and travlling to london<No i am going next month and i am also concerned. I already carry antibac wipes AND gel with me for after i have been shopping/touching trolleys etc so i can understand your concern. Also you are saying you would not like to stay away from your baby for 2 weeks when you get back to greece. i can totally understand that being a mother myself, it would tear me apart but (and this is easier to say than to do myself but) two weeks *making sure* and you'll have the rest of your life to spend with your little one..."
"<< Will people stereotype me and my hubby as some weirdo when we wear N95 mask on London streets???<<who cares what other people think, if this makes you feel better and if it does protect you then your not silly at all...people in this country seem to be more bothered about what people think of them rather than their health, this includes my hubby..."
Antibacterial wipes and antibacterial gels will have minimal to zero effect on H1N1 as it is a virus rather than a bacteria.Better to ensure good personal hygiene - wash your hands frequently - and encourage the same of others. 
"<I already carry antibac wipes AND gel with me>>Err, the H1N1 virus is a virus. And antibacterial wipes are for .. oh, I give up."
I did mention this on page 5. And I gave up.
"A doctor in Bedford died of the flu today. If a doctor doesnt have the magic bullet.....I'm not trivialising the disease. Quite the opposite - I think people should take appropriate precautions.But don't forget that quite a few more people die of car accidents, than swine flu.Look twice before crossing the road."
"HelloMy trip to London is end of September but prior to that I will be traveling around the Continent for about 40 days(Spain,France,Italy, Belgium)I plan to travel by train and crowded public transport in all the cities I will visit,I will stand in endless lines to gain admission to the popular venues and will eat at crowded restaurants and dance at crowded clubs. I will also be sleeping on countless hotel pillows during my trip/(now that is a scary thought)The swine flu is the least of my worries.I am more likely to drop my camera while shooting the perfect pic,be robbed on a bus in Rome, loose my passport or be run over by a car anywhere in an urban center.However, in case one does contract the pesky swine flu, or any ickie illness, where does a tourist go for medical attention in London?"
"Unless a specialist in ID, Epidemiology, Internal Medicine or Respirology, it's a fair bet that one wouldn't know specifically that one had H1N1 variant influenza just by signs and symptoms.But if unwell to the point that you need to seek medical attention, there are a handful of central London hospitals that offer A&E (accident and emergency) care: University College Hospital London, near Warren Street station; St Thomas's Hospital on Lambeth Palace Road; the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel; Guy's Hospital in Bankside; Charing Cross Hospital on Fulham Palace Road; St Mary's Hospital on Praed Street in Paddington.There are also walk in clinics operated by the NHS; some hospitals also offer Minor Injuries Units for those who need to be seen and assessed for .... minor injuries or concerns. I highly recommend St Bart's."
"Hi all,I will be travelling in mid September and i am concerned about swine flu...I wouldn't be concerned at all if it was like many other trips i had in the past; but this time will be my first trip with my little daughter, who will be 3 months in September.In Italy the reported cases are less than in UK, but it's foreseen there will be many many cases in autumn when the seasonal flu usually appear.My main concern is travelling with a newborn, i think i will check the situation in these 2 months and decide what to do a week before going.I already booked the flight but we are talking about 100£ through Ryan Air, so it's not a big issue.I'll stay tuned on this topic, but i will keep organizing my trip.Thanks for all the useful info i'm getting from the forum.Have a good day."
"Well, I guess I m not the only one worrying about swine flu after all. But I still dont get it. Why swine flu is spread so much in the UK compared to other countries? UK seems to have the biggest problem in Europe."
"Why the UK?The UK had lots of tourists coming back from Mexico when the outbreak started. These people then spread it to their families, colleagues, schools, etc.These people, in turn, passed it on.....I'm fairly sure there weren't plane loads of French or Greek tourists returning from Mexico earlier this year.What we do for a cheap holiday, eh?"
"<<Why swine flu is spread so much in the UK compared to other countries? UK seems to have the biggest problem in Europe.>>Yes it is puzzling. Maybe the very well traveled nature of the populace? Plus from now on the completely useless nature of the statistics, as diagnosis is done over the phone so any fever and sniffles, whether its a cold, flu, swine flu, avian flu or the black death, will now be marked down as ' swine flu'. Add to that, its an instant 7 days off work so there is a great incentive to have it. Plus, the idiotic and still practiced attitude of people struggling in to work with coughs and colds and fevers. Even now you see people writing in to criticize their doctor when they go to the surgery to ask for antibiotics for their virus and are told to go home. Doctors surgeries have notices outside telling people who suspect they have flu not to come in, there are radio and tv adverts for this, but the fact its even necessary shows the stupidity of the general british public. So, well travelled and stupid is probably the reason :-("
"<<< UK seems to have the biggest problem in Europe. >>>The operative word is ""seem"". Doesn't mean that the UK has the biggest problem. It could be a simple case of people not being tested for Swine Flu therefore cases aren't reportedwww.newscientist.com/article/mg20227094.400"
"It may not be that the UK has the highest number of swine flu cases, simply that the UK has been more proactive in gathering statistics. Unfortunately, as discussed earlier in the thread, these statistics are almost certainly inflated because people can phone their doctor's surgery to report their symptoms, which can be the same symptoms as a bad cold. The number of 'possible' Swine Flu cases seems to have been translated as 'confirmed' cases.Although not directly comparable and nowhere near as serious, this reminds me of Aids in the 1980s. The UK was in some ways ahead of the rest of Europe in creating public awareness of HIV, with HIV/Aids units set up in hospitals and a huge publicity campaign (in which I was involved) which included distributing information leaflets to every home in the country. When I was in Spain at that time, I met a few people who had heard of this campaign and became convinced that Aids was rife in the UK and said they'd be staying away. Oddly enough, within two or three years the rate of HIV infection in Spain and some other European countries was twice the UK rate, and most probably had been all along. So those who said they wouldn't visit the UK would actually have been safer doing so than staying at home. "
"""Cherie Blair has pulled out of a ceremony at Liverpool Hope University, where she was to be honoured, because she has suspected swine flu.""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8153836.stm"
"'So those who said they wouldn't visit the UK would actually have been safer doing so than staying at home. 'Wansteader,this is the point...i think i will visit London anyway in September, considering UK is well prepared regarding this issue, maybe more than Italy when the peak will be reached here in autumn, as it has been said.My only concerns are regaridng my little daughter, if it was a 'normal' trip as dozens of times me an my wife had in the past travelling alone, no problem at all...Cheers."
"BTW, that doctor died of natural causes and not swine flu.My DH and DS were playing around with numbers and statistics the other day (given the immediate panic following the very sad death of a 6 year old and aforementioned dcotor) and worked out that if you get swine flu, 99.9% of people will get better from it."
"I confirm the Greek media madness about the swine fly in England. The way they describe the fly incidents in England, is like you are at an emergency state. Thank God there is the Internet and there can be proper information. Thank you all for the useful information."
"We don't do ourselves any favours in the UK. The problem is that we tend to over-compensate with our figures in case things turn out worse than first expected. It was the same with the way BSE was reported a few years ago, you would have thought everyone in the UK had been struck down and visitors stopped coming because they thought it was contagious.We in the UK know that the figures produced are skewed but the foreign press takes everything published at face value - hence the over-reaction."
"No-one knows how many people in the UK have swine flu. The closest figure we have is the number of people who have reported swine-flu-like symptoms to their doctor. Many of those will be lead-swingers looking to get their free 5 days off work, and others will be people with a summer cold."
Of course when you just tell people they have it (and don't bother testing) because they have flu-like symptoms that include absolutely everyone who has a cold.Now what I'm wondering is will the media go mad when the normal flu season starts and thousands of old people who normally die will be dying. Will we have a counter of the dead of breakfast news? I don't think so.
did you bother to read the previous pages?
"Daily newspaper here in Vancouver says that ""BA and Virgin became the first carriers to monitor passengers at checkin and turn them away if they appeared to have flu. Virgin spokesman said sufferers who were turned away would not be allowed on board without a ""fit-to-fly"" certificate from their doctor or a hospital. P & O cruises said passengers would be assessed by medical staff prior to boarding. Anyone deemed unfit to travel would be turned away. Also the association of British insurers said that travelling against official advice would often nullify any policy and insurers would not pay out in the event of illness while abroad."" It is not just the Greek media going crazy, all media is covering this. My concern is not the swine flu in the UK as the swine flu is everywhere, my concern is getting quarantined wherever I might go and not be allowed to leave. Or have my entire vacation ruined."
"Nothing about screening at the BA website and no evidence of it when I flew with the airline just over a week ago.I asked my coworkers if the hospital at which I work had been crowded with those showing symptoms of flu in the time I was away on holiday. Strangely (or not) the Respiratory unit was not standing room only, nor has Emerg been chocka with people in respiratory distress.Unless an airline is going to provide a team of ID specialists who would take a full history to establish the differential diagnosis I'd very much doubt that their assessments would be valid or useful."
> thousands of old people who normally die <Are there habitual and serial dyers out there?
"<<Unless an airline is going to provide a team of ID specialists who would take a full history to establish the differential diagnosis I'd very much doubt that their assessments would be valid or useful.>>Indeed but that doesn't mean they won't be making them :-)Note that the new flu ""hotline"" is going to be staffed by people with NO MEDICAL EXPERTESE WHATSOEVER .. if the govt can do it, why not everyone else?"
"I found this on Virgins website, but it wasn't on the first page I had to hunt for it.http://virginatlantic.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/virginatlantic.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=430&p_created=1240840818&p_sid=JDX4xmDj&p_accessibility=0&p_redirect=&p_lva=&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPSZwX3NvcnRfYnk9JnBfZ3JpZHNvcnQ9JnBfcm93X2NudD0zNTMsMzUzJnBfcHJvZHM9JnBfY2F0cz0mcF9wdj0mcF9jdj0mcF9zZWFyY2hfdHlwZT1hbnN3ZXJzLnNlYXJjaF9ubCZwX3BhZ2U9MQ**&p_li=&p_topview=1I couldn't find anything on BA's website, but I did sind this on the Telegraph website.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/5872541/BA…Best thing to do is contact your airline if you're concerned to find out what steps they're taking, as it may be that yet again the media are overstating the situation. "
"Airlines have always had the right to deny boarding to people who aren't ill, so it isn't any change to their existing rules."
...who ARE ill...
"Hmm true Alan, but they 'usually' have a reason such as the passenger is very drunk or abusive. The problem here is that they're going to have non medical personnel deciding whether someone has flu or not, using screening criteria that could discriminate against people who have hayfever or people who have an above avergae temp. due to menopause or medication side effects (like me) or pregnancy.Of course if someone knows they have swine flu then they shouldn't fly, but many of the people that will be turned away won't be ill."
sorry Alan just read your 2nd post. 
"please someone from london tell me the situation there about the swineflu...i will go there for a vacation with my family on august 10,i got a non refundable ticket...is it really that worst there?should i go or not.pls i need someones advise"
It's absolutely fine. I live here and haven't met anyone with swine flu. Please don't worry about it.
"Read the responses here.Theres enough of us telling you not to worry.If you don't want to come, don't come."
I saw a woman and young boy at Gatwick last Saturday with face masks on. (I think they were French from their accents) The really odd thing was that they were with a man and much older girl who weren't wearing one.
"i need to know whats going on in there since,in the news its really scary and i have a friend tell me not to go and some says its okay...so if you are in my shoes..its not that easy to decide since i got a non refundable tickets.."
"thanks glyn you give me assurance...atleast someone says its okay,it really counts..."
Everyone in the UK on here has been saying it's fine.The decision is totally up to you.
"I was playing tourist (my mother was visiting) yesterday. I saw a few people (foreigners, presumably) wearing flimsy fabric masks in lower Regent Street.I went down with something last night - spent the day exhausted, aching and running a temperature, but a day in bed seems to have sorted me out."
Thank you - you have calmed me enormously!
OK. one more time - IT IS FLU .It is not bubonic plague nor the Ebola virus.
"""i need to know whats going on"" Did you read the thread at all?"
"A few weeks ago thirty UK tourists came down with suspected food poisoning in Italy, one of whom died. As far as I know no Italians have died after contracting Swine Flu in the UK.

"---https://www.pandemicflu.direct.gov.uk/Note - the Helpline is only meant for England residents....---Peter,thanks for this info, i already checked it out and i have to admit that the most reliable informations about swine flu i achieved were from the NHS site; Italian media are panicking too much, and no accurate info are available.In case i'll be there and get swine flu, on an italian site regarding safe travelling, i read that i should call a number for assistance, and contact a local GP if a category at risk is affected (pregnant women, children under one year old, etc.).That's all clear to me, still deciding if it's convenient to travel or postpone.Cheers."
"dredg - I understand your worries. Travelling with a young baby can be stressful at the best of times without the worry of any of your party being ill in a strange country and having to find your way around a different health system.I do think the swine flu pandemic has been exaggerated out of all proportion by the media (panic sells news) and generally I would not encourage visitors to stop travelling in case they catch something that they would probably catch at home anyway. As much as I would love you to come and visit our country, I do think that if I were in your shoes with such a young baby I would probably postpone my trip until the whole situation settles down, becomes clearer, the baby is a bit older and you do not have to worry about keeping away from people who might be infectious (how would you know anyway until the symptoms show). It would surely spoil your holiday if you have to think about who the baby has been in contact with."
"Marg001,thanks for your message.I'm considering to postpone our trip, giving the fact it's not 'strictly' necessary and the loss of money would be around 100 euro, the sum we payed through Ryan Air.London is just 2 hours away from here by flight, there will be many chances to fly there.We already visited Ireland and we loved the country, we want also to visit Scotland and the rest of Great Britain, so we will visit several times the United Kingdome.. ;)Have a nice day,cheers."
"guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jul/26/swi…He's right: life is such a risky business.But you only get one, so live each day and live it well."
"I think this flu is the most ridiculously overhyped thing since the last most overhyped thing - but I wouldn't come if I were you with a 3 month old.As you said, its not for business, you haven't really paid anything yet, so its effectively just on a whim, there are plenty other nice places you could go to so close to you without the travel hassle of such a young one, come back in April or May when the hype has died down, or if it wasn't hype, when we have all died. Though that seems unlikely given the past record since SARs, CJD, AIDs, BSE, terrorism, drought etc should have finished the entire UK population off several times over according to consistent scaremongering by the medical, political and media establishments."
