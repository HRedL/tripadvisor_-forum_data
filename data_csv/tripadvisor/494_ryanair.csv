If you are checking in bags then it will take longer then hand luggage only. Everything is going to take longer so best to be early. I am flying from Bristol To Lanzarote on the 4th and the advice from the airport is to be there at least two hours before departure.
Better an hour early than a minute late is the way to look at things right now. There is bound to be delays so I would tend to be on the cautious side.
"It all depends on how many flights are taking off around the time of yours as you are leaving July 6th I would think some will be canceled, your best bet is to ring the airport the day before and get the latest and correct info"
Allow plenty of time for your travel to the airport. Allow for delays. Arrive 3 hours before sounds about right for Liverpool. Manchester may take longer through security.
