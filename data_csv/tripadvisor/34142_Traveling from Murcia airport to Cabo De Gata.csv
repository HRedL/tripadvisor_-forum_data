"Hi everyone,I'm looking to book flights to the area for September this year. My holiday to the region was cancelled in April.I was wondering if things are being relaxed over there? Also is is possible to drive over the boarder from Murcia airport south to Cabo De Gata area? Thanks"
"Claire,Q 'I was wondering if things are being relaxed over there?'A Yes. La 'nueva normalidad'/the new normality started officially at midnight Sunday at the end of the national state of alarm. The 'new normality' will continue until such time as SARS-CoV-2 no longer poses a threat, i.e., an effective vaccine is available or an effective treatment is available.I've no idea what the situation will be by September but at the moment...* face masks are obligatory for all aged 6+ if social distancing (1.5 metres minimum) is impossible. Max fine for non-compliance = €100. The are a few exceptions to this apart from the under 6s e.g., if you suffer from a respiratory condition.* hand hygiene should be meticulous.* Restaurants and bars can re-open up to 75% capacity even inside with social distancing. No (or there should be no) communal things though like menus, salt/pepper/etc on the table.* Shops & commercial centres = max 75% capacity including in any communal areas.* Hotels can re-open to full room capacity but any shared areas in the hotel = 75% max capacity.* Public pools, public transport, beaches all have their own restrictions. Swimming in freshwater is still discouraged as the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in freshwater is not established.Q 'Also is is possible to drive over the boarder from Murcia airport south to Cabo De Gata area?'A Yes, travel to other Autonomous Communities is allowed.No flights to Almería airport from anywhere near to where you live? All of the above are based on my understanding of the situation in the Region of Murcia and that may well change for good or bad by September. Also, the above are in addition to the new checks you'll be aware of at Spain's airports (thermal imaging temp checks, passenger locator details, etc). Obvs, check the local town council website nearer to your flight date for alterations. Cheers!:-)"
Forgot to add...https:/…almeria gives a good overview of the current situation next door in Almería. In spanish but your browser should automatically give you an english translation if you require it.:-)
"Putting aside all COVID stuff for a minute - we have previously holidayed near Sorbas in Almeria Province but flown in and out of Alicante. Perfectly doable but you might not want to be arriving late at night. Personally I'd go straight down to Mazarron and onto the (empty) AP7, which will cost a few quid in tolls but better and quicker than all that traffic on the other road - assuming we are almost back to normal by then."
