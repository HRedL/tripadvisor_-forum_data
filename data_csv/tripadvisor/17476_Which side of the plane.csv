Gets better views of Isla landing and taking off?
the side with the windows... I'd say the right side going down and the left coming home.
Arriving much depends on the approach. With the normal prevailing winds I would say a better view on the left side. On departure can also vary but again I would try the left side. You may or may not get a view of Isla Mujeres in either direction
"We have lost track of the the number of times we have flown into the Cancun airport from the NYC airports & have never seen Isla from side or any seat from the air. Hotel zone leaving but never Isla,as I believe we fly directly on top of it."
"I agree with tschbel; the leg of the 'diagonal 7' which is part of the Hotel Zone in Cancun, but never Isla Mujeres. By that time and altitude the place is banking towards the NE on departure so all you will see at that point is the sky above (on the aircraft left anyway).¡Se diviertán!"
I saw Isla on an approach when we were senyt well out to sea for a while. Ive see the Cancun hotel zone several times. I always get a window seat.
"We came from Philly last Saturday, sat on the right side and saw Isla perfectly. All of a sudden I looked out the window when we came out of the clouds and there it was."
"From chicago, we see Isla off the left side on the way down and off the right side on the way home, if we can see her at all. We've only seen her about half of our 12 trips. It's a nice surprise."
"Strange, I've seen it several times on the left when leaving headed to Detroit?I haven't seen it on arrival but I normally sit on the left. I think we are on the right in December so we'll see! (no pun intended! LOL)"
"Planes land and takeoff into the wind. Most of the time you will be landing on runway 12L or 12R which is angled at 120 degrees. 90 degrees is east, 180 is south so you will usually be taking off over the beach just south of Cancun. If the winds shift, you land an take off in the opposite direction.Now, if you are table off from 12L or 12R and heading to the US or Canada, you are going to make a right turn just after you fly over the beach, but the actual direction you end up facing will depend on the departure you have been assigned to by air traffic control. With one departure, Isla will be on the left as well as the Cancun Hotel Zone. Another departure (which I have only experienced twice) takes you directly over the city of Cancun, so Isla will be on the right.A little TMI, I know. In short, the left side is the better bet, but you never really know what you are going to get."
"On one takeoff, the pilot announced we would be flying over the island. I had my camera and got some great pictures"
"I have been flying in and out of Cancun over 30 years and more often than not, I don't see IM at all. While I was working for the airlines, a captain once recalled how many tell him how great it must be to fly to such a great destination. His comment was, that all he had ever seen of it was what he sees from the cockpit window and then he sees the gate area for an hour or so.One of my best memories was maybe 25 years ago, before all the traffic, a United captain told us no traffic in the area and he had been given the ok to do a low level pass over the Cancun beaches inbound. A spectacular aerial view."
"Back in 2009 during the swine flu ""epidemic"", we also got the beach view due to no other air traffic. There were 5 passengers on our mexicana flight and we flew all along the hotel zone."
"duckbilled (post #9); sorry if you make a right-hand turn from runways 12L or 12R, you are headed towards South America or possibly Mexico City. Both 12L and 12R already have you headed SE, so most aircraft headed to the USA will make a sweeping left-hand bank turn. And unless that turn is more than 120*, chances are you won't see much of the hotel zone much less Isla Mujeres. For those of you seeing an island off the aircraft right-hand side (returning home), you are more than likely seeing the island of Cozumel vs. Isla Mujeres (after the big sweeping left-hand turn).¡Se diviertán!"
You are right. I meant left:(
"Left for arrival, right side for departure. I've had pretty good luck always catching a glimpse."
