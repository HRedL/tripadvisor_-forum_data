"Hi everyone,We are flying to Malaysia in 2 weeks for family vacation. First Langkawi then KL. I have small kids with me. I am following the international media re the outbreak of Wuhan Coronavirus which spread to Thailand and Singapore as well. I am aware that it is personal decision to cancel or not BUT STILL I would like to ask you, the locals, how you feel about the latest news, do you think all necessary precautions have been taken ahead of the Chinese New Year Holiday, is there any sense of panic, what the local news agencies talk etc.I was really looking for this vacation for many months now and hope all settle down asap"
HiYou really need to look at what the Turkish Health Authority are advising for travelling to South East Asia and also you must check with your travel insurers to see whether you will be covered for this epidemic.
"There are no confirmed cases in Malaysia to date. Life goes on as normal. Chinese New Year celebrations as usual, with the reunion dinner tonight.Make of that as you will and decide for yourself. It can occur anywhere in the world, even Turkey. The US already has its first case.Edited: 4:06 am, January 24, 2020 "
"Hi Steady, thank you for your response. I have international health coverage - my son got stitches in Thailand, fully re-paid, no problem on that front. Turkish Health Authority follows exact wording of CDS (https:/…malaysia) which has no warning for Corona Virus yet. I assume CDS has no warning as there has not been any reported cases for the time being. Thats why I just wanted to ask how locals feel about it."
"Paperstone - I definitely agree with you with the fact that there is greater chance of Dengue. Or anything else... I wanted to write the same comment at first place but wanted to keep it short.... Thank you for your feedback. much apprecaited.Jadamros - thank you for your kind feedback as well. 25% of Turkish Airline flights are to Far East. So definitely, you are right. Plus we have risk of terrorism here... :S I mean we have war in the neighbor countries, we have risk of terrorism in Istanbul but the international media and life on the street differs SOOO MUCH thats why I wanted to ask you directly..."
"I've just returned to China from Sabah/Malaysia - no doubt the authority continues to intensify measures to ensure public health and safety. While locals (even myself and family) have been taking extra precautions, life however still goes on as usual (echoing to Jadamros' comments)."
"WHO held a meeting on Wednesday and it was fifty-fifty decision NOT to declare the wuhan virus spread as a global public health emergency Concern , PHEIC situation.Not as yet, there are daily reviews. It's a newly mutated virus so they're monitoring its epidemiology - contagious and lethal characteristics etc. It's a developing scenario so the next few days will be telling which way the disease goes. Meanwhile the public and tourists are advised to take precautions - wearing masks, washing hands regularly, avoid public places as the virus spread by cough, sneeze and direct contact of mucus secretions on surfaces.Edited: 5:54 am, January 24, 2020 "
I have just been reading that there are several cases now in the UK so it looks like it is definitely spreading far and wide as it is also in the USA too.
"Over 600 confirmed cases and 26 deaths up to pressWe just need to be luckyAt the moment you would have to be unlucky to go down with it, but obviously some have beenStay lucky"
"According to the BBC article below, the 14 suspected cases have been found to be negative.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51232163"
"@POST 10If you are going to quote figures of such a serious nature, please let me offer some serious advice and that is at least get them correctConfirmed Dengue cases in Malaysia as at Dec 28 2019 were 130,101 which is a record, and the number of deathsreached 182 which is not a recordI have seen no update which includes the last 3 days of 2019 as yet, possible I missed itOne reason for that could be as a casual user / observer of Malaysian roads I was somewhat otherwise engaged Ha Ha HaThe reason for the carnage on Malaysian roads is many fold but the main ""driving force"" is that when on the road so many of them revert back to a very third world mindset, nowhere near a developed nation which they are striving so hard to achieveAs bad as the road carnage is it bears absolutely no relation to any infectious disease, however new A rather facile comparison you need to try harder, because who knows how this will develop in the futureHappy TravelsEdited: 3:40 am, January 25, 2020 "
"""put it into context"" does not come into it, the road statistics are a sad repeating nightmare year after year, and I am afraid are part and parcel of life in MalaysiaThe point here is that there is no relationship between this new virus and the constant road carnage on Malaysian roadsThe road deaths do not have any affect on the virus or vice versa how can they, you really can't mix and match two completely different problems, both should be aired but not used to dumb down the other, that's nonsense thinkingTourists should know about the situation on the roads for sure, but not at the expense of serious answers about the virus, its obviously on travelers minds and why notThe last figures I saw concerning the virus was 600+ confirmed cases and 26 deathsThe odds of infection are very long indeed at the moment but some havebeen extremely unluckySo discussion should be open about the potential dangers of the ""VIRUS,"" without offering up unrelated smokescreens on this potential life and death situation lMHO Who knows how this will develop going forwardAs for the roads Malaysia has the third highest deaths SE Asia of approx 6,000 which as a Government minister said is not good enough, I agree but when you remember the population is approx 32M that's a bit of an understatementHappy TravelsEdited: 4:31 am, January 25, 2020 "
"3 cases in JB.Family of the Singapore coronavirus case.Now moved to KL and are in isolation.The dangerous part of coronavirus is the it takes 5 or 6 days for symptoms to appear. Meanwhile, the individual feels and looks healthy but is spreading the illness."
"Latest news from the BBC1200 cases and 41 deathsIts related to SARS so lets hope a vaccination / cure appears soonGood LuckEdited: 4:56 am, January 25, 2020 "
"Hey, we are also travelling in a week's time and have the same concerns. Let me know what you decide. The update currently is 4 cases in Malaysia.(Death toll at 80 in China). The scary part is its spreading fast. So locals if you could kindly tell us the current situation there, would be highly appreciated."
"Sweta,It's spreading fast inside mainland China and probably thought more from aerosol (small droplets) airborne spread initially.Outside of China, the spread to other countries are those who got infected when in China. So far there's no report of 'next generation spread' from those back in their own countries to their own citizens. Since the incubation period of nCoV is up to 2 weeks, this group we're not sure how many will become ill.At least one expert said that coronavirus infection are large droplets airborne spread, so relative to aerosol spread it's less infectious. You still need to wear masks. Whats under rated is spread of nCoV bt direct contact ie by touching another person or public surfaces that might harbour the virus and then touching nose, mouth and eyes. Now there's more awareness and advice to regularly hand wash and not to be close with ill persons.What probably happened in China was that those who got ill from second generation spread, handled and touched ill persons with nCoV and didn't take extra precautions and maintain personal hygiene. Outside of China, infected tourists coming via flights then after landing, they're relatively not so much mixing with the local population. Hence, less likely for the disease to spread fast. Well, that's my take on the evolving situation. Lots of info online to digest and filter. We also have influenza, dengue and road accidents. I'll still visit and taking those precautions mentioned (but not to mainland China obviously)Edited: 10:40 pm, January 26, 2020 "
"Similarly, in five weeks I'm flying into Hong Kong, with a 3 hour layover before flying onto Kuala Lumpur. I'm concerned about being in the Hong Kong airport and also flying in an aircraft leaving from the Hong Kong airport (recirculated air, close contact with others, etc.). So, I'm in limbo - I'm not sure if I should spend more money planning my trip to Borneo and Sri Lanka. Yes, I have trip insurance for sickness but I don't need to take this fun trip this year! And currently there is no refund offered for my Cathay Pacific flight into Hong Kong, and the change fees are quite pricey. If the virus spreads to a much more serious level, I might skip the trip and lose a lot of money. I think I would feel safe traveling ""on the ground"" once I'm away from the airport and airplanes. Any advice is really appreciated."
"https:/…Very good advice from above article."" Avoid touching nose, mouth and eyes with unwashed hands""Edited: 9:34 pm, January 27, 2020 "
"Thanks, good article. Maybe it will help prevent illness if I’m brave enough to fly!"
"From the article: ""The Hong Kong and Macau governments have both placed restrictions on entry to their respective special administrative regions to individuals who have been to Hubei province, China within the previous 14 days. The Hong Kong government announced January 28 it will close temporarily certain transportation links and border checkpoints connecting Hong Kong with mainland China beginning January 30.""https://hk.usconsulate.gov/sm-2020012801/Edited: 11:26 am, January 28, 2020 "
"Latest news. A tour bus driver in Japan is infected with the virus and he was driving 2 chinese groups from Wuhan.Probably close contact spread, by touch or close airborne droplets. Goes to show apart on planes, viral transmission can occur in buses and possibly in other land transport vehicles if in close contact. Again same precautions apply.Edited: 11:59 am, January 28, 2020 "
"There's been a suggestion to keep the posts in this one place on TA, it might be helpful, but it links to Hong Kong not Malaysia specifically. Maybe useful though:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g29421…Edited: 12:43 pm, January 28, 2020 "
"@ sweta r... I havent made a decision yet. As all my flight tickets and hotel bookings are non-refundable, I think I will wait until last day. So far 7 cases confirmed, 1 in Langwaki. I talked to my driver in Langkawi. He says chinese are alot less now, people are careful and life is as normal. I also tried to reach few people on IG who are in Malaysia at the momen vacationing. They say chinese are wearing masks but there is no panic mood. Really tough call as I am travelling with 2 kids. I am more worried for them rather than myself obviously. Lets stay in touch :)"
"Hi Pelin G, just wondering did you go in the end as we have the same concernEdited: 2:20 pm, February 07, 2020 "
It's not the common flu. A country isn't going to lock down it's cities over the common flu. Many are saying that the numbers China is reporting are far less than the actual numbers. To those who keep comparing the Wuhan Coronavirus to the flu: the Spanish Flu ended up killing at least 50 million.The Wuhan Coronavirus is a pandemic. Don't take the risk. Stay home.
"Hi there, we came back on Sunday. Had great time in Malaysia, beautiful Langkawi and very nice people. I am glad that we decided to go but of course we still have one more week to pay attention to the symptions :( As for precaution, we carried masks and antibacterial gels all the time. N95 Mask is a must in the plane and airport and in crowded areas like shopping malls but besides that people are pretty cool. There is absolutely no panic mood in the country. I recommend you to go but same as we did use precaution, believe in faith and try to avoid crowded places..."
"@Pelin G - that is awesome to hear! It's doubtful that you were infected, but I agree it's very important to pay attention to any potential symptoms. I am glad your trip went well and you had no travel delays!"
"We are due to fly out to kl from manchester with a connecting flight in abu dhabi, then fly from kl onto sandakan spending time there before flying back to kl then onto langkawi before flight back to kl then fly home, are all these places still operating as normal and allowing different nationals in and how bad is the virus there as here in uk it is rising quickly."
"John, it's escalating in Malaysia as well with just over 400 cases. There was a large event of around 10,000 people and a number of infected where discovered there so a good number more cases are likely to arise.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-co…When are you due to travel out?"
"Why on earth would they allow such a large gathering to go ahead. I suppose the silver lining is it may end up with Malaysia being placed in the category 1 bracket which may make it easier to cancel a flight and get your money back.Edited: 6:16 pm, March 15, 2020 "
I am due to fly out on sunday 22nd and really hoping they do cancel flights from uk
