"See this discussion : https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g18995… There are personal experiences in the last pages.Based on these, it's probably wise to plan one night at least in Reykjavik on arrival.Edited: 8:49 am, July 06, 2020 "
"""Please be careful until you receive your test results, which should be within 12 hours arriving at Keflavík airport and 24 hours arriving at other borders. If you don ́t receive information within 24 hours please send an e-mail to testc19@landlaeknir.is and ask for the results. Stay at home or your registered location and avoid close contact with other people. ""https:/…LANDLAEKNIR-SKIMUN_turisti.pdfI second the advice above to book at least the first night in the city."
The process was very quick for us today. We had pre registered and pre paid so we had a barcode ready. We literally walked upstairs straight into a Booth each and then were out within 2 minutes.We're now awaiting the results or all clear. We have been told that if any of us has a positive result we will get a phone call. If not after 24 hours we'll be OK to go.
"Hi Picklemummy, I have been trying to find out where you can pre paid for the test but strangely enough I cannot find information on this anywhere., hope you can help. Thanks.Have a wonderful time there."
You can pre-register here within 72 hours of your arrival: https://visit.covid.is/
Thank you very much :-)
We received (most of!) our test results almost exactly 12 hours later on the Rakning C-19 app followed by a text message.My husband's result didn't turn up until a few hours after. Now we're all clear so can head to the Golden Circle!
How much is the Covid19 test now?
"Passengers are charged ISK 9,000 for a single test at pre-registration but ISK 11,000 if paid on arrival. The 2nd test is free of charge.Edited: 3:54 am, August 03, 2020 "
I have only just worked out the price of the CV19 test at the airport - £50 or so. :(Another reason to hope things have calmed down by the time of my visit.
"We paid £102.72 for our 2 tests but we figured in the grand scheme of what we’ve paid for the trip, which is 12 days, it’s not a huge expense, and we would rather that than postpone to next year. We’ve also got the benefit of there being fewer tourists here now, I imagine any other summer here would be much busier."
"Me and my husband arrive in Iceland in just over a week, can't wait but how did you find the test? and the whole process at the airport?"
@Earl Perhaps read post 3. Good summary of the process.
"After passport control, you head to the testing area. There are self service screens for those who haven’t paid for the test yet, and people check your barcodes for those who have already paid. You then go upstairs and there are 2 sections, you either join the line for testing, or the ‘quarantine’ queue, which was of course empty.Because we had been to use the toilets, we ended up at the end of a long line, but we were told to join the ‘family queue’ which basically fast tracked us and we only waited for one other family. My husband went inside a booth when called, you scan your barcode, then show your passport, he had his test and then he took our children through to the other side. Then I had my test and we were free to go to baggage claim.My husband found the nasal swab very unpleasant, but I found that one ok. The throat swab made me gag and yet I found the nose one ok. After a minute or so, it was all forgotten about and we just carried on. We asked at a desk how we book our second test for day 4-6, since we’re staying for 12 days, and were told they would contact us in a few days. I got a text saying “you have not been diagnosed with Covid” about 8pm that day (about 10 hours after the test) and my husband got his text about 10am the next morning, so 24 hours after the test. After what we’d read, we knew they would prioritise contacting the positive tests, so we had assumed by then that we were negative, but took precautions of course, like we were instructed. The car rental had asked us to ‘check in’ online beforehand, so it was pretty much contactless. All shops and takeaways, bakeries etc have had floor markings to stand behind. The cashier stands back while you pay at the counter, they have all asked if we need a receipt, so we’ve said no.I guess we now just keep fingers crossed that everyone else on our flight was also negative."
"From what I've read tourists don't need to self isolate unless they test positive on arrival, but should take precautions while awaiting their results.As we will be staying at an air bnb we will stay there until getting the result. But can anyone recommend a delivery service to order food from in the event we need to stay in overnight and not go out for food?"
"hi, do you need to self isolate until you get the result?"
@cornel you need to read about the new rules effective 10 days ago https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g189952…
thank you!
