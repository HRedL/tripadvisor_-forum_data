We have a problem in Umalas and it is awful who can I report it to? As I read in 2011 it was an epidemic? Or what can we do about it?
Report it to whoever is in charge of your accommodation. Try not to touch them as they make you itchy.
It's our villa! And the hairs from caterpillar are airborne we'll have to get pest control in but didn't want toxic spray if they are not effective. Plus it there is potential of a plague as in previous years it's cause for concern! Need to get more informed facts as another friend down the road also has a problem.
"It must be the season for them, as Elizabeth, from Villa Kitty in Ubud, was hospitalised recently after reacting badly to being touched by one"
"Not only will you get itchy, they sting. Get the pest control mob in immediately. (I am assuming it is your own villa).However if it is a holiday rental, move out immediately."
