"Aynat62 has provided us with ""factual and helpful websites that visitors can use to get updated information"".One site Aynat noted is https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/. This site is a valuable resource of current information for travelers (as well as medical professionals, journalists, policy makers and others). As cases approach 100,000, one measure of the virus is mortality rate. With the data on the site, the rate can be easily calculated, which today was 3.44%.Edited: 12:29 am, March 06, 2020 "
"Questions and Answers from the World Health Organisation and Harvard Medical School, including questions such as:""Is it safe to received a package from an infected area?"" - Answer: YES""Can I catch the coronavirus from food prepared by others?"" - Answer: IT'S UNCLEAR YET, BUT COOKED FOOD IS SAFEST.

"Aynat: The Q&As you provided go beyond fact to influence awareness. This is very different. Some core assumptions we have may not apply. And we may have to do willingly substantial things that are not pleasant or convenient. Whatever the details, success requires at all times the use and protection of medical authority. In that effort, which may take many months, its credible voice of scientific fact will unite action, and reassure in a time of uncertainty. Aynat, you have promoted this objective worldwide. For that, we are grateful. Thank you.Edited: 7:29 am, March 06, 2020 "
"To add to the valuable research that Aynat offered: Here is a considered response issued yesterday by a large hospitality company on cancellations or changes of plans related to Corona virus concerns of travelers. https:/…It may be helpful to travelers, as well as hotels, airlines, cruise lines, and vendors seeking a reasonable, objective approach as we await further scientific fact, experience and guidance from medical authority. Special thanks for the leadership Aynat provided by example in the post.  .Edited: 6:12 am, March 07, 2020 "
"The issue of the possible effects of the virus on contracts for hospitality services (hotel, air, cruise, shows, theme parks, etc), and insurance for them, is within the scope Aynat outlined in the Question.Information on these subjects will be appreciated."
"Tripadvisor has commendably added an easily-accessible Corona virus data site. https://www.tripadvisor.com/COVID-2019Aynat, who is quoted in Post 1, included a separate Corona virus data site. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Here is a comparison of recent reports from the 2 sites (9:24 PM ET this evening):Link cited in the Question here: Cases: 106,195 Deaths 3,600Tripadvisor Link: 103,168 cases 3, 507 DeathsThe point is NOT that one is better than the other--it is that1. Objective scientific fact is essential in both dealing with the features of the virus and maintaining public confidence in medical authority during the course of the epidemic; and2. Data reports may differ somewhat in the process. But they are close here--each reporting a mortality rate of about 3.4%--so the public can see that the BOTH sources provide solid reporting and a basis for conclusions, even projections. And the public can have confidence in news reports that provide the same information. As applied here, under both sets of data and previous rate of growth (approximately 2,000 cases daily) , it would not be surprising if by April 1 there are in the range of 150,000 cases and 5,000 deaths worldwide. (The US figures are too early, and with too many variables, to project now.)Edited: 9:41 pm, March 07, 2020 "
An excellent post by Aynat62! Very helpful info for those visiting NYC
"Thank you.Good contributions, Little. You ""get"" what this forum is for. I will keep an eye out for any other websites that will be helpful over the next few weeks and maybe months."
I find the Johns Hopkins international site showing numbers of the virus all over the world to be of interest. Not sure if it is considered the correct thread to put it in: https:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6
Hi sweetie. That’s a good one and the figures from that are input to the worldometer website which is what I find a little more comprehensive and includes more data and figures. No problem adding it here.
"One focus in the Question—on the connection between “planning and the actual trip”—was borne out this morning by Dr. Fauci at NIH. He urged:1. People—particularly those age 70 and above with “underlying health conditions” that can reduce immunity (such obesity and diabetes)—to “think twice” about air travel, long trips and presence in any large crowd.2. Everyone to stay off cruise ships.https:/…3fampEdited: 12:36 pm, March 08, 2020 "
"Thanks Little.The last sentence is ""“When I say protect, I mean right now. Not wait until things get worse. Say no large crowds, no long trips. And above all, don't get on a cruise ship.”This is a real thing that many people are still so glib about. It's the ""I'm OK"" attitude that will make this so much worse. Those that think they're not sick might even be incubating the virus even if they don't have symptoms. And if they are incubating, they're passing it on to other people without even knowing it."

"One of my favorites from NHK was I think in the aftermath of the earthquake/tsunami several years ago, when many were without power/water, and they showed how to use a toilet without water and dispose of contents.

I live on upper floor of my bldg and lose all my water, including toilet, within about an hour of power outage, and have often wondered about how I would manage in prolonged outage."
