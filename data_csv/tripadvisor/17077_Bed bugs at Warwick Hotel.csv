"Has anyone recently experienced bed bug bites at the Warwick Hotel in NYC. We saw some posts from 2009, but are wondering if they are still having a problem."
"There are bedbugs everywhere these days. So even if they don't have themat the Warwick, they could have them on your plane, at the theater or in a store where you shop."
There is an epidemic of bed bugs throughout North America --- even Illinois. It has been over the national news--- They only report about it in New York because so many tourists want to come here--- if anybody wanted to come to your hometown then they would report about that----
....and put a ? at the end of your title. Your post is a statement rather than a question!
"I stay at the Warwick 50-75 nights every year and have never had a problem there. My most recent stay was about three weeks ago.Hope that helps. By the way, I agree with the comments the others have made as well."
"I have just watched an iten on UK TV showing Abercrombie and Fitch store and also a cinema being closed because of the problem of the bed bugs. Also, apparently, the Empire State Building is also experiencing problems!!"

"Well, as someone above stated: it is a national (not just NY) epidemic so they are showing up in many places."
"guess that is why we should not trust the media, if bedbugs are across the land, we should start hearing about it soon, thanks for the information"
"Thank you number56, that is reassuring to hear, and your advice is helpful to someone whom has never been to nyc"
"Yes, unfortunately bedbugs are good travelers- here's the current list of USA's most infested cities (NYC isn't even in the top 5!)thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/…""The midwest dominates the list, including three cities from Ohio. The problem there is so bad that the state unsuccessfully petitioned the EPA to allow in-home use of propoxur—a pesticide banned in the 1990s—to treat the pests. “Propoxur might work for a few years,” shrugged Dini Miller, the state’s urban pest management specialist, “but then we would select for the genetically resistant bedbugs, and they would be right back.” So who’s been hit the hardest? The buggiest cities are:""#1. Cincinnati, Ohio#2. Columbus, Ohio#3. Chicago, Illinois#4. Denver, Colorado#5. Detroit, Michigan#6. Washington, D.C.#7. New York, New York#8. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania#9. Dayton, Ohio#10. Baltimore, Maryland"
"OK-- so, if bed bugs are everywhere or can be anywhere, as a traveler to NYC, are there any suggestions you would make for one to combat against the critters while on vacation? Any reports of bed bugs on cruise ships?"
There have been numerous national tv reports on this and the bottom line is to be vigilant and check your surroundings before laying down on the bed. Any sign of them or even if you think there is a sign call the hotel management.
"really annoying folksy remedy coming up!my dad, who travelled widely in asia [against his will mostly, courtesy of the armed forces] told me the following:-take a large sheet of white paper. lift the foot of the bed about one foot off the floor. lay the paper under the bed. drop the bed to the floor. retrieve the paper and inspect it. if there are bugs, some of them will have been knocked silly and fallen onto the paper..........his cure was a bit 'off the wall' as well. take four jam jars. stand each leg of the bed in a jar. fill the jars with petrol or parrafin. whatever you do; NO SMOKING!hope this helps;-)pamedited for spellingEdited: 10 years ago "
