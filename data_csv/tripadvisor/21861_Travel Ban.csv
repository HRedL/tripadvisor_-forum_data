Are borders still closed?
"Yes, Closed"
Tomorrow (thursday) the Peru President is expected to make an announcement around 12Noon - 2PM regarding the status of quarantine and border closing. Currently everything is closed until Mon April 13.
Thank you
"Yes borders are closed and there's a state of emergency tomorrow the president will announce if it will be extended or not, but I would bet my dime that it will most likely be extended"
The state of emergency has been extended until 26 AprilI do not think the country will be opened for tourism until end of the year at the earliest
"End of the year? Damn, I hope not!"
"It is not only the issue of your destination country (Peru here) but of your origin country. Obviously the destination country will not accept tourists from countries where the virus circulates, and the origin country will not allow you to travel to destinations where the virus circulates.So indeed I think there will be no international travel in 2020 and maybe neither in 2021 except maybe for some zones where different countries make a reciprocal arrangement. Hopefully in the European Union if the EU countries agree on anything, which is not obvious right now.But of course economics will play a role too, the entire world economy may well be dead before the end of the year.Then also politics. Although people accept the lockdown in most countries now, the public opinion may change completely. Especially if the economy collapses, or if the supermarkets become empty, or if violence erupts."
Yes
State of emergency extended until April 26
Lockdown extended until May 12.
Yep! pretty much. I will not come to Peru till the vaccine is ready. And I work in the tourism industry.
Yep. At least until jun
"Latest I read Yesterday on a local newspaper Is that the plan is to gradually Re-open domestic land transport and flights in July/August and borders and International flights from October. I would not plan to travel to Peru until next year, once a vaccine is available."
Yes I’m starting to see airlines with bookings starting from October.
"Don't rely on what airlines say or do. The states will decide, not the airlines.Now borders are reopening in Europe despite the virus.Edited: 3:54 am, May 17, 2020 "

"Don’t plan based on what airlines say. The Peruvian Government will decide when the borders will re-open and the latest indication (from 2 days ago) is in Oct. The airline may sell you a ticket for earlier date, but it will need to be cancelled if the Peruvian Government has not lifted the travel ban for commercial flights."
Yesterday the lockdown was extended until 30th of June
International Commercial flights are not expected to re-start until at least October ... according to local news
