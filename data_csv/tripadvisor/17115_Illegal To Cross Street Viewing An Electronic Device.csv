"For Honolulu:This article is from July.The law goes into effect on October 25 (tomorrow). It was mentioned on CBS News tonight.""The city just approved a law making it illegal for pedestrians to ""cross a street or highway while viewing a mobile electronic device."" The law covers video games, pagers and laptops, and the ubiquitous smartphones.The law goes into effect October 25, giving police time to explain the situation to people who can't take their eyes off that tiny screen in their hands.""cnn.com/2017/…index.html"
These things could happen or worse:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cznepJAbygAnd these didn't even have portable devices:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geGYQEp-vnY
"Good, here will be another thing that the police will not enforce like no riding bicycles on the sidewalks, no riding skateboards on the sidewalks, no smoking in cars with children, no jay walking, and now no looking at cell phones in the cross walks.Maybe if they had paid more attention to what the HPD Chief of Police and his wife were doing, they would all be better off.Quit wasting time on mickey mouse garbage like this, and really solve some real problems."
Good to know!!
"That is a good law, likely will not be enforced but it would be good to make people aware of the danger"
"I'm happy for it. I got ticked once for not yielding to a pedestrian: this person was on her phone at the corner and wasn't crossing for the longest time. When I finally committed to turning, she stepped onto the street while still looking at her phone. There happened to be a cop right behind me who pulled me over. Luckily, there was a very understanding judge when I fought it. :)"
I want a law making it illegal to WALK anyplace while viewing an electronic device. I am freaking tired of people walking into me on crowded sidewalks or in the mall because their head is buried in a device.
I can't walk and chew gum at the same time ... so it's OK with me.
"I can see both sides. It drives me nuts to be walking behind someone who is concentrating on their phone but by the same token people who stop in the centre of the sidewalk - especially with prams (and yes I have kids, at one stage 3 under 4 but I had better manners!) do my head in just as much. However last year when I was in NYC I did rely on my phone to provide navigational assistance, ie GPS. We always made sure we didn’t impede anyone’s way but we were looking down at the phone every few metres to ensure we were on the right track.Now I know that it is more pointed towards crossing roads but I just think we need to more mindful and not necessarily have more “laws”.Edited: 2 years ago "
"My only purpose in bringing this up was that they continue to add law after law, that are of minor importance overall, that are just another item on a list of laws they already don't enforce, and they don't have the police necessary to enforce the important laws. Murders, assaults, sex assaults, robbery, drugs and teen gangs and curfew violations are pretty high in Waikiki this year. Those need to be the focus of the police force in Waikiki. They are not going to spend their time with these petty things, unless they need to use them as an excuse to stop someone they otherwise think is suspicious. So, it's really just a joke and makes the politicians stand up and beat their chest about the things they are doing for the public.....hogwash !!If people are not smart enough to be polite, and not smart enough to pay attention when crossing the street, then the police are not going to be able to change those issues much. Why even pass these petty laws ? The government needs to focus on the resources necessary to solve the real problems. This is not much different than the cities that are trying to improve peoples health by restricting the size of soft drinks that you can buy."
"Two things bothered me on my last visit. I didn't realize that bicycles can be ridden on the sidewalks creating another hazard in Waikiki. I saw a child hit by one near Duke's statue. Luckily, he was more scared than hurt.The noise level has increased so much that I am thinking about not returning after nine visits. Some of the homeless are blaring boomboxes now and the level of noise from the revving motorcycles is beyond disturbing.I saw a real deterioration of quality of life issues in Waikiki on my last visit and banning looking at electronics in the middle of the street seems silly."
"An ordinance, which some other cities need to consider - San Francisco, i’m looking at you.Yes, enforcement will be interesting, but a start.Thank you,Hunt"
"Crime rate on Oahu is a joke, u shouldn’t not make laws because ur afraid the police won’t enforce them.  This law makes sense to me, give the Police a chance to enforce it.  But like earlier i can’t stand people walking around in daze staring at their fones bumping into people."
People ride bikes on the sidewalks but they shouldn't. They should be on the road/in bike lanes. Just something else that doesn't really get enforced I guess. :/
"I hate it when someone whizzes by me on their bicycle while I'm walking on the sidewalk with no warning, missing me by inches. Bikes do belong on the road or in bike lanes, but ask the bicyclists and they complainthat it's too dangerous. Yet they see no problem menacing pedestrians on the sidewalk."
In Waikiki it is illegal to ride bikes or skateboards on the sidewalks.I have never seen bicycles enforced and only one time have I seen skate boarding enforced.It is also illegal to jaywalk. Never seen that enforced. This won't be enforced either.
"On enforcing the jaywalking law -- that would be me. Once, when I was about to jaywalk the long arm of the law tapped me on the shoulder. The cop was very nice, didn't give me a ticket but I got a good talking to. Never jaywalked again."
"We have an election coming next year, for Governor. Maybe you should run."
"Please consider all the ramifications of smartphone use, either as a pedestrian or driverKimchi has stated his experience when driving - the law clearly favours the pedestrian in this example but Kimchi’s view is that the indecision caused by the pedestrian contributions to his offence and he is certainly correctThe lack of consideration by pedestrian users is an issue of courtesy ( which is not an offence)But where smartphone distraction by a pedestrian may cause property damage, injury or even death as a result of their inattention. then the police need the powers to prevent potential tragedy from occurring.I hear, determine and sentence offenders in court and I assure you that police lay an ever increasing number of complaints against smartphone users.Here in south Oz. You may expect a fine of around $400 just for touching your phone whilst drivingOh, and bye the bye, I truely detest those inconsiderate youngsters who stop in the middle of the pavement, phones on CheersJohn"
"JohnandKatrina,Are you perhaps the couple who posted such lovely and entertaining descriptions of your visit a couple of years ago? - And who introduced this forum to the term afmb? If so. it is very good to hear from you again~~~~~~~"
"My parents doctor's son legitimately died while walking across (or down, not sure) the street using a smartphone. He fell through an open manhole. It was very tragic, and his mom is quite outspoken about the texting/smartphone use issue now after a period of not even being able to talk about what happened to her son. It's sad that a law like this has to be made because common sense doesn't prevail, but I see nothing wrong with this new law being passed and hopefully enforced on the busy streets of Honolulu!"
"Oh, no, that is a terrible thing. So tragic.I hope she is successful.I hope the city did the right thing for the family."
Why is it the city's fault?Successful in what?Edited: 2 years ago 
"Shouldn't they be secured?There's a lot of critical infrastructure underground -, besides the public's safety to walk the streets or sidewalks."
"Were you there? Were there no cones, tape, or warning signs? I sure don't read the post as blaming the city. I read a tragic situation.For only joining today, you sure seem knowledgeable about Oahu. Do you live here in Hawaii?Edited: 2 years ago "
"Placebets - many of these laws exist primarily to assign blame during an auto accident. Including riding bicycles on sidewalks and jaywalking. Yes, you are not supposed to do it and there are some situations where the police may stop you for it. But it's more important in situations like the one cited with failing to yield to a pedestrian. Someone who fails to take their right of way or look before they begin crossing because their face is buried in a screen. This law creates somewhat of an ""out"" for the driver in those situations. I live in a ""fault"" state, so don't know how accident reporting works in a ""no fault"" state like Hawaii. But where I live if you jaywalked and are hit by a car. The pedestrian will be found to have caused the accident and cited for jaywalking."
"SnowBunny2017, I haven't heard anything about the parents in the incident I mentioned filing suit. We were told that the incident did occur in a ""work"" zone, but we don't know if he was just so engrossed that he missed the signs, flags, tape, etc. or not. From what my parents have reported, there was an initial period of shock (maybe embarrassment?) following, where his mother took a break from the practice altogether and then when she first returned wouldn't even speak of it...now she makes a point of educating families and especially teens to put down the devices."
"TrvlngGrl96, thank you for the additional information.I hope that you did not think I was basing my question on any confusion that you were blaming anyone. I didn't read your post that way at all.Profound grief probably is the explanation for his mother's leave of absence.AkamaiNick4SW, I don't think the death happened in Hawaii. I think it happened on the mainland.  Infrastructure protection and safety aren't location-specific concerns."
"What a tragic story, Trv. I hope they are able to find peace and healing as time goes on.Snow, I felt you were blaming the city, not Trv."
"Kind of interesting what the European response is to this ""epidemic"" dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5035191/Airbags…"
"""Illegal To Cross Street Viewing An Electronic Device""I for one only cross the street when the electronic device says ""Walk"". Has worked out so far~~~~~~~~~~"
"I've never seen one that said ""WALK"" in Waikiki ....You must stand there a really long time before you finally give up.Edited: 2 years ago "
Hah! Good point PB!
