"Hey, can anyone tell me what is happening with the Cholera outbreak right now in Cuba. What area of Cuba is this included in?"
"Here is Patrick Oppmann's latest report on the ""outbreak"".dailymotion.com/video/xs58lo_cuba-deals-with…"
"It is a rare outbreak which to date is quite confined. From previous posts, I believe that you are going to Varadero. Water at your resort is treated. If you are staying on the resort and in that area, follow basis good hygiene practices and you should have no problems.Thanks to TA member Senor Radar for posting this link in an earlier thread:dailymotion.com/video/xs58lo_cuba-deals-with…(senor_radar types fast!)Edited: 8 years ago "
That was a good n informative video senor_radar. Hats off to the Cuban gov't for allowing the filming and interviews. Let's hope that they now have the upper-hand on this.EDIT....and your video was just as splendid Mad!Edited: 8 years ago
