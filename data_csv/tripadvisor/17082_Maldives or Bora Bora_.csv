"After several years of business travel I am ready to cash in my Hilton Honors points and splurge on a trip. The big delima is whether to go to Bora Bora or the Maldives (Conrad Hotel). At either destination we would be staying in a Hilton property. My husband and I like to snorkle, explore a day or two but mainly just relax in beautiful surroundings. Does anyone who has been to both (or one) want to share their opinions and suggestions. Also your input on best time of year to travel would be helpful. Thanks to all that respond! :)"
Hello! I have been to both Maldives and Bora Bora. I stayed at Conrad last Dec 2009. In Tahiti I stayed at St Regis Bora Bora and I also stayed at the Sheraton Moorea and Tahiti (Papeete) which I believe is now the Hilton properties.Which one would I choose. Both are amazing and I don't think you would be disappointed with either. I personally choose the Maldives and have been 3 times and am booked again this year. However I am choosing to do all inclusive now as our bills just get too large (whoops). This for me is a good option in the Maldives (some people don't think the all inclusive is very good in the Maldives but I think it's great for my needs.) Conrad is an amazing barefoot luxury resort. . Scenery is gorgous. Beaches are wonderful. The soft sand is what I love. There are many restaurants including the underwater. However we enjoyed other restaurants there a lot more. Still a great experience. I will put some pro's and cons belowBora Bora- Getting off the plane was one of the most amazing experiences. The scenery was simply breathtaking and made me shake at the knees. The mountains coming out of the water is WOW!-Accommodation was superb but I don't know what Hilton bora bora is like but it sure looks gorgeous as well.-Food was great but both my husband and I did get sick of French food after 1 week. It actually ended up being a bit rich for us.-It wasn't as relaxed as the Maldives. I kind of felt it was a bit over the top. Service seemed fake there. I would just like to point out that I really enjoyed Moorea and the Hilton there is in an amazing location as well. I would have been happy to stay there. Our overwater villa was beautiful. Smaller then at St Regis but I actually really loved it and felt comfortable. I actually felt a bit out of my league at the St Regis however this might be what some people are looking for.My main reason I choose the maldives is I just feel more relaxed there.Maldives-The Sea plane transfer is breathtaking-Prefer the food hands down- More barefoot luxury. So more relaxed. I found the people more friendly in the maldives.- Fantastic selection of restaurants at conrad-Accommodation is beautiful at conrad.Just be prepared for a bill at both! But having the Hilton points I guess it doesn't matter!! We just rang up a big bill at both places! But we have such wonderful memories!If you have any questions about Conrad please let me know. If the accommodation is the beach or deluxe beach villas i have a type out room numbers I would choose!Goodluck Choosing!Kim
"Thanks Kim for the great info. So helpful! What ""months"" did you visit each location? Maybe ""availability"" will be my deciding factor :)-Karen"
"Hi Karen, we went to Tahiti end of feb early march. At bora bora it was quite windy which made it cooler. But I did feel a bit cold in the water but I am a cold frog... The staff said it is often windy that time of year. Been to Maldives in may and twice in dec! We had sunshine all times but dec was the best in 2009! Perfect sunshine every day! I think it comes down to a bit of luck as the time before we went in dec it was sunny for most but we had big storms which made for a rocky speed boat transfer I won't forget! Sea plane much better option!!Good luck with availability ! Both places r amazing!!"
"We went to Bora Bora for our honeymoon. It was beyond incredible. We stayed at an atoll in a OWB that looked out at Bora Bora. We took a speed boat when we wanted to visit the island, ate at the famous Bloody Mary's, etc. The water, weather, food, people - all amazing.We're headed to the Maldives for the first time this year (June 2011). From the US its about 30 hours in travel whereas Bora Bora was about 15. We are told however, it is well worth it. So we will see! You cannot go wrong with Bora Bora and from what I have read, you cannot go wrong with the Maldives either!"
"We stayed one week at Thalasso Spa in Bora Bora and one week at Hilton Moorea. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. We are going to the Maldives this summer so I can't compare them yet, but I can tell you Bora Bora is a must at one point in one's life if you can. I wasn't sure how my husband was going to beat the last vacation but he promises Maldives is just as breath taking."
"I have been to French Polynesia (Tahiti, Moorea, Rangiroa and Fakarava) and the Maldives. Both are amazingly beautiful destinations, but I would give the edge to the Maldives.BeachesThe Maldives is the clear winner. Its beaches are endless and have fluffy white powdery sand. Most of the beaches in French Polynesia consist of crushed coral, which is not powdery and is hard on the feet. Above Water SceneryFrench Polynesia is the clear winner here, with the dramatic peaks of Moorea, Bora Bora, etc. There is really nothing to see above water in the MaldivesUnderwater SceneryBoth destinations have world class diving and snorkeling, but I think the Maldives is in a class of its own. The snorkeling is unlike anything I have ever seen, and the sealife is so abundant. The diving really provides the wow factor with the manta cleaning stations, etc. Plus, certain locations have whale sharks, which for me was the sighting of a lifetime. That being said, the diving and snorkeling in French Polynesia is VERY good and will not disappoint.WaterBoth destinations have gorgeous turquoise lagoons and extremely clear water. I think the water in the Maldives has slightly better visibility, but visibility depends on so many variable factors.ResortsMost Maldivian resorts sit on their own private islands, so you are basically confined to one island unless you do boat trips. This is great, as long as you enjoy the island/resort. This is not the case on most French Polynesian resorts (with some definite exceptions). Both destinations are known for their luxury resorts and over water bungalows. You really can't go wrong either way!!"
"Im so glad you asked this question...I enjoyed reading the replies.For our 1 year anniv last year, we went to Bora Bora...It was over the top amazing!! We started off in Tahiti, then Moorea, then Bora Bora.Moorea is great for ATVing and exploring by foot. Bora Bora is all about the lagoon and where we spent most of our time. It was breathtaking. We stayed at the Four Seasons and service was top of the line...everything was perfect. But as someone mentioned before, you do need reef shoes to swim as there are coral that you have to walk in to get into the lagoon.We swam with the sharks and rays, definitely a trip I will never forget. I get tears in my eyes just thinking about that place!The plane ride from LA is 6.5 hours.We are giving Maldives a try this year for our 2nd anniv...so we will see how it goes. I have high expectations. I do think the food will have more variety and there will be more late nights as opposed to Bora Bora when everything shuts down at like 10pm.. Let us know what you decide....just a thought though- the Maldives may not be around much longer 'they' say..maybe 20 more years?Amanda"
"Soonerdiva and/or Amanda - some months have passed and I'm wondering if you've been to the Maldives yet? If so, how would you compare the two destinations? I had an unexpected health issue come up so we had to postpone our trip to next year."
What is the cost comparison between tahiti and maldives?
I has to be said - Bora Bora is a MISSION to get to from the UK!
"From California it is less expensive and a much shorter travel time (6 hrs vs. 20+) to go to Bora Bora. As far as cost, I'm using points for air and hotel so that does not matter as much. Both islands are equally expensive once you get there but since we won't have paid for airfare or hotel it is doable."
"PD, Cost is not a question just between maldives and polynesia... It all depends on the resort you choose, you can go to a 100$ Per. Night resort or book a 15000$ Per. Night Suite at another one st both destinations, it is up to you... Another example, my usual resort at Punta Cana is more expensive than many maldivian resorts, but there are many cheaper, it is up to you...Edited: 9 years ago "
"Thank you everyone for this thread! My fiance and I are currently debating our Honeymoon which will be in September 2012. We are based in NYC, so Option #1 would be NYC -> Napa Valley -> Bora Bora. Option #2 would be NYC -> Maldives -> Dubai. Both trips sound amazing, but we can't decide! It seems that September is ""Spring"" time in Bora Bora and part of the wet season for the Maldives. Has anyone been to either during this month? We would be looking to go the second half of the month.Both of us are TOTAL beach bums and definitely want to have an overwater bungalow. Much more a cocktail on the beach couple than hiking/diving. However, would like to have some variety in terms of different restaurants/areas to see.Please help!"
"Caroline I cant really help you with the weather question, we were in both places in May of separate yearsIf you want a variety of restaurants, it really depends on where you choose to stay. In Bora Bora you can have dinner at a variety of resorts and on the main island if you choose to stay on a Motu but you will need to travel by boat and depending on where you stay will depend on the charge. At the FS BB it was $25 pp each way.In Maldives there are more AI options, travel between the islands are very limited!!! The Conrad had quite a few restaurants, but very expensive. For instance, the underwater restaurant Ithia was I think $350 pp, the Wine Cellar dinner, about the same. However you do not need to pay these prices but the islands are tiny tiny and you will be limited to what is available on the island. If someone has experienced anything different, please feel free to correct meIf you want total and complete relaxation, you will love the Maldives. I really dont think you can go wrong with either. Im curious about the weather though. It did rain 2-3 days when we were in the Maldives in May. Only 1 day in BBWe also stopped by Dubai, but on the way to the Maldives...if you stop by there, dont miss the amazing Sunday Brunches they have to offer, and of course the Hooka!!Happy Travels!"
"Caroline:I can offer some advice as I fly from NYC as well and have done both trips you describe (except the Napa Valley part).-September is a good time of year for travel to French Polynesia. We were there in September and the weather was generally nice and the water visibility was great.-We did NYC >Dubai>Maldives last February. You would likely do the Dubai stopover prior to the Maldives portion of the trip. Make sure to spend at least three full days in Dubai, as there is so much to do. I agree with Pegasus - try to be there on a Friday (not Sunday) for brunch.-If you want alot of variety in terms of sights and restaurants, the Maldives may not be the best choice for you since you will be confined to one island (unless you visit two separate resorts).-If you go all the way to French Polynesia, consider visiting at least two islands. Moorea, for instance, is a spectacularly beautiful island. Take a look at the Hilton Moorea.-The overwater bungalows/villas can be found in both locations.Please feel free to PM me if you would like more information."
"I'm so glad someone posted this!! I've been dying to choose between the two places. I mean both are on my list but I wanna go away for our anniversary/re-new our wedding vows with my husband and I couldn't make my mind up either.After reading all the post though.....first my heart wanted to go to Bora Bora. But I'm thinking my choice is to go to Maldives, it's just one of those places still that not too many people visit/ or talk about too much. Also the fact is every year it's disappearing a little. Sooner or later there will be no islands it will be all under water."
"Hey Kim I really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts feelings and opinions w the rest of us. My fiance' wants to get married in Bora Bora, I say the Maldives! If I were to choose the Maldives what over water villa do you recommend we stay @..? You said you have some #'s written down on which villas are the best ones. Also if they have an underwater hotel (I'm not sure yet if they do; still need to look into that) what is your opinion or advice on that. Anyways long story short; my fiancé says Bora Bora and I'm between Bora Bora, Fiji, or the Maldives. Please get back to me, I could really use your feedback or anyone who's been to any of the 3 Islands I mentioned. Thank youEdited: 7 years ago "
Go for three weeks and split the time between the Maldives and Bora Bora!
"Thanks for resurrecting this thread, lots of good info, We've started researching for next year (FP).Not sure how easy it would be logistically to do both in the same trip Xarla. From the UK we are looking at a 3 week trip due to the journey time."
On Housewives of Orange County- I am not admitting to watching this!They showed Four Seasons Bora Bora water villas. Amazing!
"We considered going to Bora Bora a while back... but ended up going to the Maldives. And now we are going back to the Maldives again. And again...From all of our research and experience the Maldives are more intimate and romantic. Bora Bora is getting more and more crowded and commercialized, and has less of that laid back atmosphere that the Maldives offer.If you are beach lovers like we are, you are going to be blown away if you go to the Maldives. Powdery soft white sand. Bora Bora is more about the beautiful lagoon, although there are nice beaches there too. Plus the snorkelling is supposed to be better in the Maldives.Hope this helps. Let us know what you decide :-)"
Hi ! Congrats !! I m not Kim but just saw the post n want to share my experienceI would pick between Maldives or borabora and not Fiji ... Been to Fiji it's nice but I wouldn't say it's anything special... . Maldives was a heaven !! I m still dreaming about it !! Crystal clear water just very very relaxing . I stayed at Conrad at the time
"I have also been to both in the past 24 months.In Tahiti: Moorea, Tahaa and Bora BoraIn Maldives: Lily Beach, and this April: The Park Hyatt HadahaaThe above ground beauty as many have said here in Bora Bora is quite something and many people who travel to FP actually do a good bit of island hopping (unlike the Maldives). We went to 3 island in 10 nights.A quick album I threw up from the 3 islands: http://imgur.com/a/mysja#0There are a good amount of activities in Bora Bora and other islands. Barbecues with dancers, tattoo shops, shopping, adventure tours (tons), zip lining, diving, para sailing, for wheeler island tours, etc. Notice I did not list snorkeling, *sigh*, the snorkeling in some parts of french polynesia can be quite good, however a lot of the tourist islands have been very beat up and only a few coral gardens accessible by boat have ""great snorkeling"". The underwater life of the Maldives is jaw-dropping and snorkeling is the main activity (for us).So a quick summary (my opinion only):French Polynesia (Society Islands):Positives:Island hopping for a diverse vacationLots of on-island activities and toursLush above ground sceneryGorgeous lagoon colors (Bora Bora)Abundance of fish and small sharksIf you are a diver there are larger pelagics and sharks here5 star resorts all over the placeAmazing sunsetsClose to the USA (Easy flight from LAX versus 26-30 hours to get to Maldives)You can bring up to 2 liters per person in alcohol (recently changed to 4 I believe)Cons:Underwater life is far better than the caribbean, but not even a comparable to the Maldives (for Snorkeling)Price is on par or higher than the Maldives (IMO, we stay at nice places)Lack of all inclusive for the most partI would wrap up French Polynesia by saying that you could potentially get the best of both the Maldives and French Polynesia here by visiting the Society Islands in combination with the Tuamotu islands (coral atolls similar to the Maldives): https://www.google.com/search?q=tuamotu+islands+pictures&hl=en&tbo=u&tbm=isch&biw=1284&bih=730From the USA French Polynesia is a great option. If snorkeling is in your top 2 or 3 priorities though the Maldives may be for you.Maldives: First off another quick off-the-cuff album: http://imgur.com/a/icTZN#0Pros:Amazing, amazing, amazing snorkeling and underwater life diversityGorgeous over water bungalows with 5+ star serviceAvailability of plunge pool bungalows in the Maldives is a plus for meGorgeous scenery, relaxingNot ""tons"" to do as far as excursions (comparatively), I call this out as a positive as I go to the Maldives to relax.Amazing reef/coral diving, whale sharks, manta ray'sSimilar in price to Bora Bora (maybe a hair cheaper?) All inclusive options (absent best I could tell in Bora Bora)Did I mention underwater life?And I'll mention underwater life and snorkeling again.For us it is a matter of personal preference that I would choose the Maldives for our return trip this year. There are a few places that I return when travelling (my own personal attempt at seeing the world). The Maldives made this list, so did South Africa (Safari). For others that do not put as much importance on underwater life French Polynesia is really very excellent and close for those in the USA. Both are similar in price. At the end it comes down to personal preference, your adverseness to long travel and importance of snorkeling and diving.I'll give an honorable mention to other bucket list locations:Wakatobi, Sulawesi, Komodo IndonesiaRaja AmpatPalauLizard Island, Whitsunday Islands Australia (GBR)SeychellesMozambique, Tanzania, Botswana Africa (Safari)"
Thanks for the great review and gorgeous photos! Can you tell me where you stayed at each and any suggestions on best time of year to go.
"Sure thing, my reviews:Bora Bora: IC Thalasso:tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g311415-d596…Tahaa: Vahine Island:tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g309693-d302…Moorea: Hilton:tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1918344-d30…I would mix it up and do at least one hotel in the Tuamotu Islands:tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g297573-Tuamotu_Archi…I think you mentioned you were a Hilton guy, so on Bora Bora you are going to want to go here:tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g311415-d304568…Edited: 7 years ago "
"Thank you everyone for sharing. As I'm from NY, I think it might be closer to go to Maldives than Bora Bora. I'm more towards Maldives now :-)"
"The best way to get to the Maldives from NYC is from JfK to Dubai on Emirates -12.5 hrs. Then from Dubai to Maldives on Emirates -4.5 hrs. You can fly the A380 which is a great experience with a good amount of room even in coach. Emirates' entertainment system is incredible, so the time passes quickly. Once in the Maldives you take a seaplane to your island."
"one other important item not mentioned is weather and time of year. French Polynesia has opposit seasons and the rainy summer season is in the winter for northerners, that is not true about Maldives.Soo, if you are looking for a mid winter break you may be better in the Maldives"
"Patrick- where did you stay in the Maldives? Did you do All Inclisive? If so, would you do it again. What month did you go?"
"Kybee,We went to Lily Beach in Dec 2010 and returned to the Park Hyatt a few months back.We love the Maldives and would return for a 3rd visit, hopefully sometime in the next 2-3 years. I thought Park Hyatt was a great hotel with a great AI plan. Very worth it with amazing snorkeling. We are actually heading to Fiji on our way to Sydney for Xmas/New Years and the price for flights from LAX are very reasonable, and many of the resorts are reasonable as well. Should be any interesting comparison to add on this thread....."
bump
"In the past 13 months, two times to Maldives ( although many times before that...)and once to French Polynesia including Bora Bora. Returning to Maldives shortly and to FP ( including Bora Bora) soon. Both are my favorite but would like move closer to FP.As a none diver - Maldives wins hands down for shore snorkeling.( pick a resort with a house reef.)FP doesn't have many resorts with shore snorkeling, many nice coral gardens within very short boat trip (ie 5 minutes) Corals at Bora Bora are more colorful than those in Maldives.depends on what are you looking for from your holiday. islands outside Scociety Islands in FP offer greater remote feeling, some are famous for shark diving, easier to see huge sharks in French Polynesia than Maldives. ( well my record was a 400 lbs 7foot + nurse shark spotted at Ihuru's reef vs many huge reef sharks ( sometimes a few 100s spotted everywhere in FP.)Divers prefer Malduves.If snorkeling is not a priority, outside Society Islands the natural beauty was hard to beat. ( Bora Bora too or even more so however with ongoing trend of modem resorts opening at both countries, some resorts to me are a little 'man made')Edited: 6 years ago "
"I would agree with almost all of the sologirl points. We have been to Moorea, Bora Bora and Tahaa in the Society island. In Fiji (last month) and we have been to the Maldives twice (Lily Beach and Park Hyatt). French Polynesia: Good shark diving and other large speciesGood snorkelling with boat ride to coral gardens (but nothing compared to a good maldives resort)Great on-island activitiesGorgeous natural beautyCultural interaction opportunitiesBora Bora is gorgeous but very commercial, very high end resorts (IC Thalasso, For Seasons)Overwater bungalows in abundance$$ - $$$$$Fiji:Mountainous beauty on main landNice outside islands with a variety of things to offer including good diving and snorkellingSnorkelling at our resort was OK, but probably on par with a mediocre maldives resort (Royal Davui Island)Amazing shark and large fish diving. Had a great bull/tiger shark dive. Amazing, huge animals.On-island activities like zip line/four wheelerMain land not as beautiful as Bora Bora (IMO), more like MooreaAlmost no over water bungalows5 stars tend to be boutiqueAwesome bath and body products (Pure Fiji) - LOL at this making the listCultural interaction opportunities$ - $$$$$Both of the above are much closer to the USA than the Maldives, making them ideal for people from the western USA.Maldives:Snorkelling is the best of anywhere I have been by a land slideAbundance of 5 Star resorts with overwater bungalowsGreat service (resorts we have been to)Gorgeous natural water beautyYou are stuck with the island you choose (for the most part)Almost no cultural interaction with locals/activities outside resortTightly controlled alcohol, pork and religious items laws (opposite in FP/Fiji)$$$-$$$$$Of the 3 which would I go back to?1.) Maldives2.) Bora Bora and Tuamotu Islands French PolynesiaNot sure where I would stay in Maldives next round, somewhere with a great house reef for sure. In Bora Bora I would return to the IC Thalasso (on points this round).Probably will not go back to Fiji. It is lovely, really it is, but it is pricey and relatively far away for us (East Coast US). Do not get me wrong, you actually have budget friendly accommodations in Fiji and French Polynesia, this is not true of the Maldives IMO. We still enjoyed our time in Fiji and it was a great stop on the way to Sydney!More than happy to answer questions about any of the three. PM me or reply to this thread."
"So glad I found this thread as I too have been trying to decide between the two for our vacation this summer...now leaning towards Maldives. A few of you mentioned all inclusives - would you recommend those? We want to stay in an OWB and are also looking for island/resort recommendations. Likely be traveling from JFK and would love to do a few days in Dubai.Also, where did you all book through? Any sites offer packages with air/hotel or better deals? Any help with this would be greatly appreciated."
"Re. post 33 from a non diver, I cannot speak for the high end Maldivian resorts as they are out of my league, but for sheer colour and diversity of corals for snorkelling , some resorts near Sharm-el-sheik, Egypt were far superior to the Maldives house reefs I have been too.  The Maldives only wins for me , due to the hassle free nature of the above water experience, but sadly I feel that rustic simplicity has priced itself out of my league. I will happily compromise in the future."
"I am trying to decide whether or not to go to FP. The main purpose would be for the snorkeling. I have read alot about it and it seems that most of the snorkeling in FP is related to shark/stingray trips or snorkeling over ""coral gardens"" which are small patches of reef surrounded by large areas of sand bottom. Neither of those would interest me as I prefer to snorkel over a large continuous reef area that has healthy coral and a large variety of fish as per what I saw in Fiji.I would appreciate any information as to whether or not my perceptions of snorkeling in FP are correct.Thanks in advance."
dean - maybe ask this q in the FP forum as well?
Paul- I posted the question on the FP forum 2 weeks ago and never got a response so I was hoping someone could answer it on this forum since there are people who have been to both places on this forum.Thanks in advance to anyone who can provide input to my question.
"I also think there will be more people from the Bora Bora/ French Polynesia forum will be able to answer this question but anyway...FP is related to shark/stingray trips or snorkeling over ""coral gardens"" which are small patches of reef surrounded by large areas of sand bottom. =》actually in Bora Bora many travelers join a half day tour of 'shark & sting ray feeding' which is very true, the guide won't take you to the best coral gardens.-- after researching you will find yourself another tour mainly about descovering the reef. the focus on either toir is very different.I prefer to snorkel over a large continuous reef area that has healthy coral and a large variety of fish as per what I saw in Fiji. => French Polynesia surely offers that too but you will need to do your research and find the right island. after my 7 trips to Maldives, the 8th lined up shortly and visited both Society Island and Tuamotu archipelago I would say if you want a reef with abundant fish life only 2-3 meters away from the shore of your hotel, that will have to be Maldives. Shore snorkeling is easier to achieved in Maldives than in Society Islands.As very few resort in French Polynesia offers that although there is -- I haven't found another person on Maldives forum have visited Tuamotu except myself -- most visitors only reported back their experience at the Society Islands and many visitors not aware the beauty and underwater of other islands -- I am very grateful that I start with Lonely Planet before asking where shall I go on the forum, otherwise after numerous reading of trip reports at FP forum I might still miss out many nice archipelagos at a first glance. having said that, if u want nicer beach , that's Maldives between the two ; if you want ultra luxury resorts, it's still Maldives -- Anantara Kihavah, Jumeirah Dhevanafushi, Cheval Blanc Randheli, Velaa in Maldives are much more luxurious than resorts in French Polynesia. There are more resorts on the very up market side in Maldives than Bora Bora these days, esp from 2011, surely those cost more $ than resorts in Bora Bora too. It was true that 10 or 20 years ago Maldives was cheaper, but not the case anymore.Having said that, I found both destination beautiful and the corals in Bora Bora ( required a boat ride to the right place though.) bigger, healthier and more colorful that those in Maldives.-- I realised we spent twice as long as others holiday in Bora Bora hence more opportunity to discover the underwater beauty of Bora Bora compare to others too. Maybe before the major coral bleached in Maldives, the corals were just as beautiful or even more so and I should have visited Maldives in the 90s...anyway, if shore snorkeling is a priority, hands down for Maldives between those two. Try to book a resort with a decent house reef though -- there are more resorts without a house reef than with one in Maldives."
Thanks for the detailed information.
"HiMy husband and I spent 7+ days at the Conrad Maldives and it was an amazing experience and hotel. The journey by sea plane to get there is the beginning of your fabulous experience. There are many restaurants and options from: buffet, to a wonderful fondue/wine bar, to a beach champagne sunset dinner, to the underwater restaurant/bar to the 5+ course dinner in the wine cave and many, many more. If you are a Diamond member- you can take advantage of the high tea and cookie snack from 4-6pm and then head over to the bar for free drink(s) and appetizer(s). The pools, beach, diving and snorkeling were great. The staff was very hospitable and there were lots of things to do each day- or just relax. Some travelers we met stayed in the OWB and they were very pretty. We opted to not use our points to do that as we have other places we want to go. We have actually booked the Bora Bora Hilton as well as the Moorea Hilton for our trip this year and care rather shocked how many points it is! Soooo...we hope it is worth it , since it will be hard to top the Maldives. Have you considered the Conrad in Bali ? That was ABSOLUTELY our favorite Hilton property of all time ! And there is lots to do in Bali and it is very reasonable. There is also a newer Conrad in Thailand on Phuket - yet the Hilton Resort in Phuket is beautiful and very close to all the shopping and restaurants (plus it's hard to be massages for $25.) Have fun !! If you have more questions- please ask !"
"Been to both. Maldives. FP has been spoilt and it's a pain to get there. The only reason why I'd go back would be to stay at Le Tahaa and also visit some of the most off beaten track remote islands.Read my reviews on Tahiti, bora bora, moorea and Tahaa.Edited: 6 years ago "
"what a lovely summary you have here. I have been to Bora Bora three times and now am going to the Maldives in February 2015. I have seen the ""mountain"" in Bora Bora and now going to see the ""Ocean"" at the Maldives. Beautifully written post, thanks again!"
"Been to Le Tahaa resort and spa, what won me over was the main island of Tahaa.. so beautiful I will never forget that place."

Strange..
"Let's be honest, nothing can beat St Regis Bora Bora.Bora Bora huts you just jump off into this turquoise lagoon. You can't do that at Maldives, it's all coral and shallow waters. The earlier comment about bora bora having hard coral is complete crap as you can never touch the bottom in bora bora whereas Maldives it's the most shallow country in the world.We stayed at the taj exotica in Maldives and as beautiful as this place is, for the well travelled and the high maintenance type look nowhere else but St Regis Bora Bora (even four season Bora Bora does not compare to St Regis Bora Bora).And all the comments about ""laid back Maldives"". Hmmm at $1400 minimum per night, I want immaculate service and top notch."
I think you just got the wrong island. I agree that if you choose a resort with a huge shallow lagoon you might miss out on swimming but a lot of resorts have deep lagoons and if you go to an island surrounded by a reef the swimming along the drop-off is superb - deep turquoise water and spectacular sea life.Taj Exotica does not have a reef and is located very close to the airport so it is not representative of the best of the Maldives at all.
"maldives for europeans and asians, bora bora maybe next"
"I think I would have skipped FP the next 6 months due to chikungunya outbreak, its quite epidemic at the moment.."
"As Vegard suggested, for those who are deciding where to go this year, best to hold your French Polynesia booking, at least do not go during the rainy season due to the severe chikungunya outbreak. Luckily I went during their high season which was also the dry season. The situation is not looking good in FP since the rainy season has arrived.Well I have stayed at all the so call 'best out of best' resorts in Society Islands, -- Four Seasons Bora Bora, Intercontinental Bora Bora, Le Taha'a Island Resort and Spa by Relais & Châteaux and,,, St Regis Bora Bora, to be fair the St Regis in Bora Bora doesn't even top the former 3, neither would it be the best St Regis among the Starwood. Xarla is spot on. The amenities and butler services are far better at Jumeirah Dhevanafushi and Anantara Kihavah ( Maldives) than those at St Regis Bora Bora. The most luxurious resorts in Maldives nowadays are $2000+/ night, far more than what Taj charges...No need to bring in Cheval Blanc and Veela...Comparing French Polynesia with Maldives, after my second holiday to French Polynesia and multiple trips to Maldives, my view of both stay the same as per # 40 in this thread, with just another plus for FP -- to swim with humpback whales, esp a mother and her calf is something truly sets French Polynesia apart from other tropicals. You can swim with whale sharks in Maldives, however the fully grow up's size is smaller than a one month old humpback -- imagine the size of it's mama ;))Edited: 5 years ago "
"ventsurlonde,Thanks so much for this fantastic, and detailed comparison! I haven't been to FP, but always imagined the same things you mentioned here, that's why Maldives will always win it for me, especially since I am a more beach or seclusion type.I have been to Zitahli several years ago, loved the blue part of the lagoon, the soft pure sand, but found the snorkelling and the marine life not so so good compared to some other islands I have been to in the Maldives. So you can then imagine the big difference in terms of snorkelling when you compare FP to islands such as Kandholhu, Mirihi, Dhevanafushi for instance.Thanks again, really helpful comparison.Edited: 5 years ago "
"Great comparison!Just one comment about Maldivians being 'uptight and straight faced'. We often found people had a wicked sense of humour, but sometimes it took a little time with some people being a bit shy initially, also bearing in mind English is not their first language. Perhaps they saw or heard about you sunbathing in your birthday suit ;)"
This is awesome. We are trying to decide between the two for a honeymoon and we live in San Francisco.
I actually think it is cheaper to get to the Maldives than it is to Bora Bora even though it is quicker to get to Bora Bora for me.
I'm so glad you posted your experience with everyone as I am looking into going to both places; The Maldives and Bora Bora & i also want to make a stop in Dubai. I would like to know how much money did you take in total or how much was it (was everything included?) so that you/I can well spent without worries.
Thanks for the comparison - you answered what I needed to know.
"Thank you for your detailed comparison! My husband and I were set on Bora Bora but my friend mentioned Maldives being more exotic. I like that Bora Bora is closer as we live in California. This will be the first time we will be traveling without our children so the thought of being that much further concerns me. We are celebrating our 15 year anniversary so this year our travel plans for this summer is for my husband and I as we never went on our honeymoon. Anyhow, Thank you for your very detailed comparison!"
"I liked what you said and the fact that there are more tourists in Bora Bora has made my mind up and it's def gona b the Maldives on my bucket list, cheers for that xx."
Maldives has just as many tourists
Awesome reviews thanks

"HiWe have been to both. But both are vacations where you enjoy relaxation, sun (hopefully) and the wonderful sea and marine life.We also enjoy fine dining. But we go to small resorts which, whilst the dining is acceptable, it is not up to the standards that you receive in San Francisco.Both places are expensive. Whilst I believe they are gorgeous, if you enjoy a more active holiday, I would suggest that there are better options for you."
Bora bora was heaven! We upgraded in cash too for the over the water bungalow and it was the best money spent!! The reef there was SO amazing!! We were able to just jump off and snorkel away!!! We even had a barracuda and an eel that hung around the whole time!! We are now 5 years from that trip and looking to cash in the next set of Hilton rewards!!!
All of the information was very informative thank you so much for your detailed review of both places now I have to decide which one I'll go to First
Thank you soooooo much for this great explanation. Been to the Maldives many times and was thinking about Bora Bora but family loves the Maldives ... so Maldives it is again (also closer since we live in Europe)
