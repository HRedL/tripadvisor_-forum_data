"Hi,I am a Dutch citizen visiting Dubrovnik, I was wondering if it is possible to cross the border to Montenegro with my own car to take a short visit to the nearby town of Herceg Novi and back?"
The problem may be when you go back to Croatia from Montenegro
"Please, note that “ALL EU countries” as long as you did not visit previously (15 days before) one of the countries off the green list"
"Yes, that’s what I’m worried about! :-)"
Update: Did the trip this morning with no problems whatsoever
"Thanks for the updateSo, no issues at all on re-entry to Croatia ?"
"None whatsoever, I did have to buy an car insurance green card for €15 upon entry to Montenegro because I hadn’t brought mine with me but other than that, no problems :-)"
Hi MartinDid your passport get stamped at the border into Montenegro?
