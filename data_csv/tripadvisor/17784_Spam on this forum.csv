"Just a heads up to those who watch this forum regularly regard the recent explosion of spam.Moats of the specific destination forums have been worse hit than this one, so you may not be aware that there seems to be an epidemic right across many TA forums. Stopping it seems to almost impossible. The most that regulars can of is click on the report button and choose solicitation/spam as the option. The more folk that do this, the sooner the offending posts get removed. Whatever you do, please, please do NOT post a reply as that makes the situation worse by prolonging the life of the spam post.Sorry to have to post this, but several DEs and regulars on this forum are away travelling at the moment so we aren't checking the forum as often as we sometimes have time to do.Your help is appreciated."
"I've reported all posts on here as spam individually -- also sent a note to the mods with the person's id to try and get rid of them! grr... aggrevating! but you're right, seems to be an epidemic across the forums."
A real problem at the moment - they were spamming the Air Travel Forum earlier.
"Yea, wings, I did the same. But I just thought that I'd let the other folk know what to do if they come across it.Also, sorry for the typos, I'm not as good on the iPad when travelling as I am on my home keyboard!SWT"
at least they disappeared from the RT forum quickly! ugh!
Just done the next lot!

Bump since this was on page 2. Heading off to report all of those threads.
yup! just nailed them again myself. thanks for the help!
"How does the deleting work? I just reported a few more that seemed to be lingering and they literally disappeared when I clicked report the second time. Do they delete automatically after a certain amount of ""reports"" are clicked? Or do they disappear from my feed only?"
i think they disappear after multiple reports from multiple users.
"Well, that is good to know :) Teamwork keeps the spam away.Edited: 7 years ago "
"yep! thanks for helping us out here. Couple of DEs are gone and without or little internet access, so appreciate the help here."
"Love Guru???Wings, you and your friends are so good, I haven't seen a bit of spam all day.Shucks! :-)"
"Been sitting around all day with a stomach bug, so made it my mission to zap the spammer! Sorry you missed out on the great deal to improve your love life lol"
"Wings, I and certainly the spammers wish you a quick recovery!"
