"We arrive in HCMC and plan to stay three days before heading to Phuket for a few days. We then head back to HCMC for one day before flying out of SGN back to the US. Does a single entry E-visa cover this, or do we need something different?"
"> Does a single entry E-visa cover this, or do we need something different?No, of course it doesn't. You're entering Vietnam TWICE. A SINGLE entry E-Visa won't work.Either get two E-Visas or get a multiple entry pre-approved visa letter from the likes of vietnamvisapro.netOne disadvantage of two E-Visas is that you'd have to wait at least until you were in Vietnam before applying for the second E-Visa and they're sometimes slow at approving them so you might find yourself worrying if it will come through in time. I'd just get a multiple entry pre-approved visa letter."
