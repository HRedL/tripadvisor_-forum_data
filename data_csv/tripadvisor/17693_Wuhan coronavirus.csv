"Up pops another one. Since I commented three days ago, and it was pointed out it was a facile argument, 120 people have died in Thailand in RTAs. Not one due to the virus."
Just as many or more from liver flukes.........care for another plate of somtam....555
"My wife is a theatre nurse. She showed me a video of surgery to remove a severe worm infection. It was like buckets of spaghetti, put me off my food for the rest of the day."
"Airports have thermal imaging cameras to pick up arrivals with higher than normal body temperatures, perhaps fevers. That’s all that can be done.You just have to weigh up the risk of travelling - how much is the risk that you’ll catch this virus?Fully agree with the comparison above, too - how much risk that you’ll be involved in an RTA in Thailand?Compare the two, and the first is less risky."
"the 21st<<Chinese boy, 10, lands in Phuket suspected of carrying Wuhan fluPHUKET: A 10-year-old boy from China suspected of being infected with the Wuhan coronavirus is in isolation at Vachira Phuket Hospital after he landed in Phuket on a direct flight from Wuhan with his parents last night (Jan 21).Phuket Public Health Office (PPHO) Chief Thanit Sermkaew said that the boy had an elevated body temperature and exhibited “likely symptoms” of being infected with some form of influenza or pneumonia.“His condition was discovered by officers checking at Phuket International Airport,” Chief Thanit told The Phuket News."
"I find it strange that it seems to mainly only be the Thailand copping these constant posts about the virus out of China.Australia has more ppl diagnosed with the virus then Thailand, yet not a single post about it in at least four pages.Edited: 1:10 am, January 23, 2020 "
"""I find it strange that it seems to mainly only be the Thailand copping these constant posts about the virus out of China.""That doesn't surprise me at all. What does surprise is that Thailand isn't getting blamed for the outbreak in the first place. Imagine if this did happen in Thailand and the authorities waited until now to stop the outward flow of people.All the regulars would be straight onto blaming the Thais and the junta."
"Snake or bat soup as possible origing of flu....https:/…Add a for more.....Richard Baroow: ""A 73-year-old woman is the first Thai to test positive for coronavirus. The patient fell ill shortly after returning from Wuhan. There are now four confirmed cases in Thailand. Three are Chinese tourists.""https:/…Hope the ol' gal's (other's also) immune system is up to snuff. Flu's hit older folks hard. Chok DeeSurely it's Trump's fault .....Edited: 10:50 am, January 23, 2020 "
"63 folks died in road accidents yesterday.59 were on scooters....along with 3000+ injured.4 or more people got sick with the flu .... kind of puts in perspective.Another 50 or so will die today, and tomorrow on the roads.Edited: 10:58 am, January 23, 2020 "

"I still can't get my head around the 'no light' thing. They are more to be seen, not to see. I always live rural when at house (non rental), and they even ride out there when limited street lights with no lights. Mind boggling.Thankfully newer scooters lights are on by default. After 1st shift, PoPo gone, and it goes from 90 % use of helmets, to 90 % not using. Does make you wonder.som naa na"
The driving with no lights on at night is also very common in Sri Lanka. Perhaps they think it uses more petrol when they put the lights on ?I nearly posted about Thai craziness on the roads after driving down to Cha Am from Bangkok 10 days or so ago. It is no wonder so many people die on the roads when you look at the stupidity of so many drivers
I do remember in Burma many years ago they didn't use lights since in was so difficult to get bulbs. So they only switched the lights on at junctions then switched them off.
"Hello,Today the 5th case in Thailand was announced.I am travelling on february 15 to Thailand for 2 weeks. (Chiang Mai, bangkok and Khao Lak)For now i m not worried much about 5 infections in Thailand. But i'm not feeling comfortable watching what happens in China. Whole citys are shut down. Noone can leave and enter. Maybe there will be a lot of infections to in Thailand in one or two weeks, as there are always many Chinese Tourists (after Chineses new year)..And i dont want to be in Thailand if they do it the same way than in China: Just lock cities up... Feeling more uncomfortable not being able to leave Thailand again than about the Virus itself...I will surley follow what happens, and in case when it gets worse in one or two weeks in Thailand, then i will probably think about skipping my holidays and go elsewhere...I dont want to be trapped in Thailand.What do you think?"
"Yes, i saw that to.But we never know if the 5 people had contact with others, which could mean that there are much more people out there with the virus than initially thought..Lets see how it will be in about a week, guess we can see how fast it spreads at that moment."
"Over 1000 killed in traffic accidents, just this month so far, 47 a day, and you are concerned about catching the flu.hmm..... you're obviously not a small child with an undeveloped immune system. Maybe an extreme senior with a weak or a bit younger, with a compromised immune system.I'd be more concerned about mosquitoes, or the person preparing your food who just came back from the toilet with no hot water or soap.Just sayin'Edited: 8:52 am, January 24, 2020 "
"Then don't arrive with a fever and or flu like symptoms. I don't think they'll be cancelling world travel, because a few 100, if so, die from the flu.10s of thousands die every year from the flu.Edited: 9:17 am, January 24, 2020 "
Trapped in Thailand?Trapped in a country? Singapore has multiple cases of the virus..are you also concerned about that? Perhaps you should focus on that.
"""I'd be more concerned about mosquitoes, ""and on that subjecthttps://reliefweb.int/report/thailand/moph-t…62 deaths in the first half of last year.Well the measles epidemic has been knocked out of the news."
"As the above post said, I would be more concerned about those mozzies. Although it is a bit worrying especially when I'll be in Krabi on Monday - I guess Mask is the order of the day...Jim Carrey here I come"
you mean the Chinese Virus?Quarrantine is imposed now
