"Not sure if COVID had gotten to everyone's brains or what, but the videos and pictures coming out of the Mara are terrible. Hundreds of cars at the river crossings with people out and walking around. Cars chasing the herds to force them to cross. It is a pure mad house.Thankfully the warden has taken some action, but seems to be just against a handful of operators. From the pictures there are at least 30 or more that merit this. The letter issued yesterday bans Mario Tours, Twiga Tours, Olkinyei Tented Camp Vehicles, Olderpoi Camp Vehicles, Sunworld Safaris, Nashulai Conservancy Vehicles, and Mara Ngenche for a period of 30 days effective from the 10th of Aug.Let's hope that this ban will serve as warning to follow the rules and respect the wildlife. Please remember that you as the client can most definitely remind the guide that you respect the wildlife as should he and that breaking the rules will not only mean no tip, but also a bad review."
Here is a news article on the subject.https:/…
"I was in Masai Mara last week. At the river crossings at Mara River last Tuesday there were only around 15 to 20 cars on both sides. In our car one tourist wanted to get out of the car to pee at the first crossing, at the second crossing we saw, he wanted to smoke a cigarette. Our driver told him strictly to stay inside the car. But what I realized, all cars I saw didn't keep to tracks and often went off-road."
"Hi JamboHouse,Glad to hear that your guide was responsible. I wish I could post pictures and videos on the forum. Not sure why this week was so much busier and out of control, but lets hope that the crack down on bad behaviour cleans it up quickly..."
"Wow,,,, Sad this is happening, but glad tourism is picking up and that the park is enforcing their rules. It’s a shame that they had to take these steps however.... Hopefully everyone will regain their senses and respect the environment as they admire it."

"Oh dear, this is so irresponsible and I hope that the crackdown works for the sake of the Maras future. It's a place we hope to visit in the next few years but I don't want to witness the animals being forced into unnatural behaviour. I feel sorry for any responsible tourists who may have booked trips in the next month with these operators and I guess will have to now find alternative arrangements."
"Some of those names are no surprise to me, as I remember a couple of them behaving badly at non-crossing sightings at other times of year. They forget that the name of their company is on the side of their vehicle or on their spare tire on the back! Too often it seems that getting to a sighting first or getting their client the shot comes at the expense of respecting the wildlife. In this case, they allowed their clients to get out of the vehicle which puts them at risk as well!"
Hopefully the 30 day bans will be a warning to other companies that they can't get away with doing stuff like this! I hope the rangers keep enforcing the rules and I would be pretty PO'd if I had a safari booked in the next 30 days with any of these companies.
"I would be PO'd if I had booked a trip with these companies at ANY time, not just the next 30 days. Responsible tourists would not want to promote this behavior, at any time. With all the choices available, and the good reviews you read, it is hard to know sometimes, but I'd be cancelling any booking that I have in the future with these companies, if this is their attitude."
"Quite sad to read this. I really hope good sense prevails and such behavior is brought under control soon.It's sad that some of these operators don't realize that they aren't damaging just their own brand but brand Kenya. A classic case of a focus on short term gains impacting longer term viability.Let's hope this ends very soon.Take care, everyone!"
"It's bad news on one level but very good news also as it looks like domestic tourists are flocking to the newly discounted tours. Kenya will show the hunting lobbies that it can be the world's model of no-hunting conservation, sustainable even in times of hardship.The education is paying off. People's minds can be changed. When schools reopen I'd like to see a subsidy program that lets every student in Kenya visit a nearby park with their class. Some of the better off schools have been doing that for years but we should get every Kenyan into a park...THEIR parks.Edited: 1:42 am, August 12, 2020 "
I'm planning to visit the Masai Mara soon and hope that I don't see any signs of unethical operators ruining tourism. This epidemic shouldn't be used as an excuse.
"This has probably happened before, a few or many times, but always been isolated incidents,But strict Park rules and suspension will help educate everyone involved (drivers and tourist),Also, it is possible the tourists are out of control too, i don't believe the drivers are solely to blame, they are usually under the influence of the tourists they are carrying,These companies are old, long established and popular with tourist and probably with a list of future bookings,Is the driver suppose to throw back all the tourists back in the vehicle if they leave without permission..."
