"Hi allI had my heart set on basing myself in the Kas area when I visit Turkey for my first beach holiday mid-June. From some research, it appears that most beaches in the area, bar one or two are all rather cold (sea temperature) due to the natural cold springs in this area. Can anyone verify if this is the case? If so, it will very likely mean that I will search for an alternative place to stay as having the warmest waters possible is quite important to me and my travelling companion. I was hoping water temperatures would be at least 24 or 25 degrees by that time in June, but if I am reducing chances of enjoying a warm sea simply due to my chosen location I will be really disappointed!Thanks all in advance for your advice!"
"You wouldn't choose Kas for a ""beach holiday"" as it doesn't have any beaches near the town other than the tiny pebble beach Kucuk Cakıl Plaji and a mile outside Buyuk Cakıl Plaji ""big pebble beach"" and yes, both have cold springs coming up through the warmer sea due to the mountainous location. Most of the swimming is done from platforms at the beach clubs. Limanagzi beach and its beach clubs are accessed by boat from the harbour. 13 miles along the coast road is Kaputas beach, formed by a gorge that opens out into a stretch of sand but around 200 steps down from the road means there are limited facilities on the beach and it can get very crowded and hot!There are some good photos on this website https:/…"
"Thank you so much scousemouse, your insight is much appreciated. I am actually quite happy to drive 20 minutes from my accommodation to get to a nice beach each day, so my reasons for deciding on Kas were twofold - a pretty town without an abundance of 5 star AIs, as well as nice beaches within 20-25 min driving. Initially I was planning on staying in Side, but my research gave me the impression it was more touristic than I would like as well as having most beaches crammed full of chairs/umbrellas. I then read more about Kas and felt it offered the type of holiday I am after (pretty town with cafes/restaurants etc for the evenings and beautiful beaches without chair/umbrella overload within a reasonable drive), but my worry now is that beaches within a 25 min drive will be colder (albeit beautiful) than other parts of the coast due to the cold springs, and sadly this is making me seriously consider staying elsewhere."
"There actually is a lovely beach in Kas. I used to walk to it everyday when l holidayed there years ago, as did lots of other people, and l believe there’s a dolmus going up there nowadays. Even better. Its quite a walk from town, but well worth it, and in June will be very warm l can promise you. There’s absolutely no need to go to Kaputus beach which is a good way away. Kas is a beautiful holiday resort. I have been to almost all of them, but Kas will always be my favourite. I am sure you will love the place too, and have a fab holiday."
"Thank you josephineh226 - which beach is it?I am just worried that the sea temperature in the Kas region will be cooler than other parts of the coast e.g. Side due to the natural cold springs. I have no doubt Kas is wonderful hence why I thought it would be the ideal base for my holiday, but just worried about cooler seas."
"It’s the big pebble beach mentioned in post 1. A lovely beach with a few restaurants on it, so you can spend the whole day there, if you wanted to. As l did.I was there in the May, and though l don’t swim l did go in the water, it was lovely, lots of people swimming and children were splashing and playing in the water. June is a few centigrade hotter so will be even warmer. I am sure you won’t have a problem with the sea temperature at that time of year."
Whilst it is true that there are natural cold springs that flow into the sea (or rather more often come up from underground) around Kas - as indeed elsewhere along the coast - you only experience the cold water fleetingly and with just a couple of strokes you are soon out of it and back into the warm water.
I agree Attagul. It can even be welcome when its very hot! And definitely not enough of a negative to put anyone off going to a lovely place like Kas.
"Thank you so much for all of your replies! I am very grateful for everyone's insight.You have convinced me that Kas is still the best place for me to stay, so many thanks!"
"I quite agree, it doesn't make the beaches cold, as Attagul says it just means you can be swimming and have one arm in warm water and leg in cold, a very odd sensation.We like big pebble beach and walk there most days, I hate beaches like Side west and Icmeler where everyone is packed in like sardines right to the water's edge and you can't even see the sea for umbrellas."
Scousemouse - or even your legs in the cold and your top half in water nearly as warm as your bathwater!!
"We went in July and the water was lovely, but even then you could swim from mainly warm water into a cold spot for a couple of seconds, weird, but fleeting, you;ll enjoy Kas"
"I know my reply is far too late for travelgirl1981 but just for anyone else who is wondering about sea temperatures in the Kas area - we have stayed many times on the south side of the Cukurbag Peninsular - the hotels there have their own beach platforms and the sea is warm. We go in September but I've also swam in the sea in Kas in September and it is cold, Kalkan too. Limanagzi which scousemouse mentions a short boat ride away with its beach clubs is very nice and the water here is warm also, at least it was when I went there. It seems that Limanagzi and the peninsular are not affected by the cold springs. The hotels and villas on the peninsular are only a short inexpensive taxi ride away from Kas which is such a delightful little town, it's worth having to travel either by boat or water taxi for warm sea just to have the experience of eating out and looking around Kas in the evenings. Some classy shops too.Edited: 7:36 am, July 25, 2020 "
"Hi, this is not too late at all! My trip to Kas was in fact cancelled due to Covid-19 so I am now planning for 2021!"
"Oh of course it would have been cancelled, what am I on about!! Well, it will be something nice to look forward to next year. The sea probably won't be quite as warm in mid June as it is in September though. I have swum off the beach platforms at the Villa Mahal at Kalkan and discovered the further out you go, the warmer it gets. Not sure if that would apply at the Kas beaches. The problem with the sea on the south side of the Peninsular though is that it can get quite choppy in the afternoon, although as I said above it is much warmer. We stayed at the hotel Villa Tamara with lovely gardens, sea water pool which is always warm and with steps down to the beach platforms which are really very quiet. I will miss it this year! The hotels on the tip of the Peninsular look lovely but I think the sea there is much choppier/rough."
