"With the out of contol sickeness problem in Porta Plata and Punta Cana, has anyone heard of any virus epidemic in PDC? I'm not talking about an occasional sick person, I'm talking the 1/2 a resort who is all sick. "
we're just back from PDC and didn't hear ANYTHING like this.. met w/ a lot of couples from various resorts and everyone was fine...
We just retuned from PDC today. We ate and drank everything in sight in and out of Playa and had nor heard of any problems.
I'm curious about this too. And wondering if those who have recently returned had the Hepatitis A vaccine before they left?
I am going to mayan riviera in March and it was recommended by my physician that I get hepatitis A shot. Going today to get my shot.
"Our group of 25 just returned from a week at the Riu Tequila on Friday. Out of this group, 4 got seriously ill (both severe vomiting and diarrhea, lasting 24-48 hrs) and another 4 got mildly sick.Many other groups seemed to have the same percentage of illness."
Not what I wanted to hear. It is supposed to be a strain of the noro virus in Dominican. I hope it does not make it's way to PDC. We are going in March with a 6 year old.
"I wish they didnt make the shots so expensive and insurance won't cover. I would love to have my whole family 6 of us vaccinated before we leave. Any suggestions on how to get it cheaper than $85 a pop, and as I understand you need 3 shots for lifelong immunity."
