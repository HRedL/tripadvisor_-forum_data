"Hello,A question about iced drinks. As the normal rule to avaid unwanted diarrhoea is to avoid ice unless ice is made from bottled or cooled boiled water, are there places in Hoi An (as well as HCM, Hue and Hanoi) that serve these drinks with ice that are known be from ""safe"" water? Don't really want to avoid sinh to (fruit shake) or cafe sua da (iced coffee) so wonder if anyone has any suggestions? Thank you "
"Everyone on the forum is bound to knock me for the following, but this is truly what I experienced on my trip last March. I had been warned like everyone else, but I'm a bit of a rebel, and I really like my drinks very very cold. Someone on TA happened to mention that they coat their stomach every day with Pepto Bismol tablets, so I took 2 every morning. I then proceeded to eat and drink everything, reckless, perhaps, but it seemed to work for me. I had no problem whatsoever with intestinal concerns. It seemed to work for me, and I intend to do exactly the same when I return in '09. I even put ice in my beer - can't take it even slightly warm or cool. I also ate salads, tons of fruit, and basically anything I felt like it. That sugar cane juice is wonderful (I was expecting super sweet, but not at all - actually has lime in it too)."
"I guess if you see a restaurant / coffee shop having many foreigners inside, you can trust their ice.From my memory, in HCMC, Pho24 and Quan An Ngon has safe fruit juices with ice. I drank everything so I can’t remember where I ordered what.My husband had diarrheas in HCMC and Dalat but he has it very often at home also."
"i drank ice all the time- no way was i going to give up the brilliant vietnamese iced coffee, and had no problems. especially in the tourist oriented areas i wouldn't expect too many issues. as far as i understood it, most ice was manufactured and purified. though a few times i saw a person here or there chipping ice on the sidewalk from a large block. probably wouldn't have drunk it in those places..."
"We drank drinks with ice everywhere & we never got sick once, but we also csrried pills with us in case. I think like the previous poster just be careful & if it doesnt look clean & safe then dont do it."
"We buy tea from supermarket and make a very strong tea when my husband has ""problems"" ;-)The Lipton tea hotels give is not strong enough."
"While we carried Immodium everywhere with us we didn't use it. We drank cold drinks in cafes but not from street vendors and that worked for us. As to ice in the beer, my husband learned to ask for a cold beer and an ice bucket to keep it in as the warm weather tended to heat it up before he could drink it all :-)"
"I must agree with all the other posters here.Avoiding ice in Vietnam will only cause misery - it is in everything delicious!I think a bout of or two of mild diarrhoea is unavoidable, but as many posters have pointed out, if you usually have a cast-iron stomach at home, you may get through unscathed. Those (like me) who are a little more sensitive should just make sure they carry Immodium/Lomotil with them at all times. And don't worry about running out - these are easy to buy over the counter in all pharmacies in Vietnam. Oh, and always carry a small packet of tissues with you - many toilets don't have paper!I honestly think the only places with 'safe' ice would be 5 Star Hotels - I'd say 90% of other restaurants/bars etc. would just get it from the usual suppliers.The only time I've ever gotten seriously ill was from buying one of those pate & pork bread rolls from the side of the street. Now that is something I'd recommend avoiding!"
"You're no more in danger in Vietnam than in Sydney - come to think of it maybe you're in more danger in Sydney. Coincidentally when we were in Vietnam last month we attended a talk about health issue in Vietnam by Dr Marc Paquette, Senior Medical Officer with International SOS Vietnam. Other than taking the usual commonsense health precautions, if you're intending to live in Vietnam like we are then he suggests having shots for Rabies and Japanese Encephalitis. My thoughts are, within reason, if people worry excessively about whether they should or shouldn't drink or eat certain things, they're not going to enjoy the trip and maybe they shouldn't go. By the way Marc suggested Vietnam is definitely not a good place to have a heart attack so make sure your medical insurances include repatriation."
"I guess u, guys are all foreigners and so used to western hygiene stardard while in VN, ppl have the much lower attitude toward this matter. I heard that vendor food in Vietnam is a nightmare for those, whose stomach are vulnerable and sensitive. all kind of street food will not always agree with foreigners and the best way to stay healthy is to get away from food sold by vendors and food served in anonymous food stall and stick to your favourite food in reputable and cleaning-looking restaurant. Do not rely much on pills against diahear because they will weaken your stomach's immune capacity. But still I believe that nice cafe in big cities will offer clean ice. ymmycookie"
"Calaspara,What is Japanese Encephalitis? You are correct, if you have an heart attack or something happen that required to major surgery, Vietnam ain't the place for it to happen...So is China.A friend of our travel to China and he required an emergency surgery, let just said if you don't the cash up front, they won't proceed with the surgery!!!Yummy...the best part of visiting VN is able to eat vendor foods. You get to know so much more about the people and the culture. I guess you will pay for it later with stomach upset...but nothing couple of shots of vokda can't fixed right?"
"Japanese encephalitis is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia, with 30,000–50,000 cases reported annually. Case-fatality rates range from 0.3% to 60% and depends on the population and on age. Rare outbreaks in U.S. territories in Western Pacific have occurred. Residents of rural areas in endemic locations are at highest risk; Japanese encephalitis does not usually occur in urban areas. Countries which have had major epidemics in the past, but which have controlled the disease primarily by vaccination, include China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Thailand. Other countries that still have periodic epidemics include Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, India, Nepal, and Malaysia. "
