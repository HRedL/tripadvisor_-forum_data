Is it safe to travel to Marakesh. We have a holidau on 5th March 2020
"In my opinion, yes. I have a trip to Marrakech planned for April and will be going unless the Foreign Office officially say that we shouldn't travel to Morocco."
so far Morocco is Coronavirus free. We hope it continues to be for the locals and tourists
"We are in Morocco now, no sign of Coronavirus so far but I have seen on news sites the govt here is banning large gatherings. Not sure what this means, will the Djemma close?"
"Sol..We cannot say anything yet.All is PERFECTLY open at the minute.If some update..be sure that we will be the first to inform our fellow Trip members here.Cheers,Olli."
"keep your eyes on the news, everywhere can be now corona virus, not yet in Morocco or Jordan but you never know. It is fast spreading over the whole world. In Spain are cases, in USA are cases, in Sweden etc, to not talk about Italy, poor they."
"I am travelling to Marrakech on Weds and cant wait :)The way I see it, is that you could get Coronavirus no matter where you are, so relax, enjoy your trip and what will be. will be."
"Till now, we don't have any case of Corona Virus in Morocco. I think, Morocco is now safer than the most countries in Europe and US"
"Spoken like a true Moroccan Current update: https:/…Edited: 9:07 am, March 02, 2020 "
@Tim thanks for the link
have read there is going to be travel restrictions on countries with coronavirus.
Have cancelled my trip to Agadir on 18th because Moroccan news said restrictions on travellers from countries that have coronavirus might be put in place. Expensive if you have it while out there. Rather have it in Uk Cheaper
what doe they mean by travel restrictions?
"My guess is compulsory quarantine if a foreign tourist turns up at any Moroccan land, sea or airport and is unfortunate enough to be tested for the virus which comes up positive, but where would they put all the infected victims, I can't imagine it would be in an expensive hotel, more likely a grubby old Pension with a guard at the door, and will the travel insurance companies foot the bill for all incurred expenses and losses, somehow Morocco is looking a lot less attractive this year."
"@ mooIt generally means that all flights from majorly infected places ( right now Iran , China, Korea, Northern Italy and other places) could be canceled and those arriving on ship or land borders might be turned back at the boarders.At the moment I think just Chinese flights are refused landing privileges.For now you just have to fill out a form questioning points that might indicate exposure. They are also watching for passengers that have visible symptoms.Wonder if you land with a common cold will you be sent back from whence you came or quarantined."
Thx @ comicmanIt all seems very confusingYes up to now just Chinese flights are refusedNo idea what next week is and not even tomorrow
First case Morocco is confirmed today evening. The person is a Moroccan who lives in Italy. He came to Morocco few days ago.
"Well, I guess no more Italy flights and boats. Now."
It's what they said last week starting from this week. They will cancel all flights from/to Italy. But i don't know if it's official or not yet.
"We are booked to come to Agadir in April. With the current rise of cases in the U.K. I wonder if Brits are going to be stopped from visiting?As a heads up to people returning, if anti-bacterial hand gel is available is Morocco, bring some home with you - it’s like gold dust here!"
"I am set to leave on the 3rd of April and I am still going. We aren't going to Marrakech, but all other places."
@Laura Welcome to Morocco. We hope that you will enjoy your stay in amazing Morocco
"We are still planning to travel to Morocco, arriving on March 16. Condolences on the first fatality. So very sad for her family and friends. And prayers to the other current patients for speedy and full recovery."
We are arriving on the 16th too! Still planning to go
"We are supposed to arrive on the 19th and as of now are still planning to go. That said, it seems that a lot of countries/cities are starting to implement lockdowns so I think the biggest concern at the moment is getting locked down in Morocco past the period of time you are intending on being there (assuming the situation gets worse and they implement a lockdown while you're there).Edited: 1:27 pm, March 11, 2020 "
"We are planning on going there on March 14, and I haven't considered cancelling the trip yet, but right now I'm starting to wonder if it's smart to go..? I'm bringing a child and don't want to risk anything. I guess my main concern is if it suddenly blows up and we're not allowed to leave the country. And also that there's a LOT of tourists going to Marrakech at all times, and it might be spreading around there even tho it's few reported cases. On the other hand we have more cases here in Norway so I guess it's not more safe to stay here unless we keep at home.."
"Are there any additional health controls at the airports? In Marrakesh?Regards,Marta"
Travelling next week -last minute!- to Morocco as had to cancel a long-planned two weeks trip. This virus is everywhere even Australia now but travel is not the major cause... the WHO actually didn’t advise against travel or trade as this would have a disastrous impact on world economy. So it’s a very personal decision...
"There are currently eleven different threads about Coronavirus on the Morocco forum which is getting really confusing, so I have consolidated and summarised these onto one 'master' thread which is at MASTER: https:/…105988803Please don't use this thread, instead please post on the master above."
Where are you travel from and then through what country?
"HI - I hear lots of tourists at airport cutting trips short and wondered if restaurants etc all still open as we are planning to go there Mar 26thEdited: 1:41 pm, March 13, 2020 "

"I have the ticket Prague Marrakech for 4th April, wanted to spend few days with my Moroccan boyfriend. The Czech Republic with current 141 positive cases today closed the boarders for everybody and forbid the citizens and foreigners with long stay to travel. So now we can go NOWHERE, nobody knows for how long....so hopefully I will be happy to get money back....and hopefully will be happy to travel soon again and to meet somebody who is dear to my heart.... wishing to Moroccan people and all the World that this Corona (I hate this word already) disappears soon and will stop spreading...hopefully the warm temperatures can really help. You who still can travel do it, go there, if you feel well and are not potential infected persons, to not spread it in Morocco that really doesn´t need ti. I wish you a nice time there, now in spring it is really beautiful....enjoy also for me :)"
"As mentioned elsewhere on this forum the real problem is the possible containment and enforced quarantine of foreign tourists by Moroccan authorities within their land and sea borders, this could be worse than catching the virus itself disrupting all onward holiday travel plans.I got an email from Easyjet yesterday offering a change of flight plan without financial penalty from the one I have already booked, or a full refund of my outward and return fare if deciding to cancel."
I’ve heard there are 5 cases but not death. Enjoy your holiday.
"Yes, I think that coming to Morocco and being forced to stying in quaranteen can really happen. Cases are 8 now, from which 1 dead, 1 healed, all came from Europe.Morocco really doesn´t deserve thil illness. But deserves and needs not contamined tourists. I truly hope this will pass soon. If somebodys flight by Ryanair was affected, did they contact you some days in advance? As my flight is on 5.4. and I still have no news (they can´t know the situation at beginning of April). I need the refund as this my line stops working at the end of April....and then hopefully come to Morocco very soon....nice day and lots of health to everybody."
"""Morocco really doesn´t deserve thil illness""which strange claim you have, Marketa. Do you mean that other countries deserve it?I know what you mean, but I am sorry, you would not say so.Reaarding your question about Ryanair - they will sure inform you then and you get back your money or can change date. If they not do it it would be strange.Edited: 7:10 am, March 14, 2020 "
When are/were you due to fly to Morocco? I am supposed to be going on 16 mayI haven’t heard anything from easyJet and trying to contact them is nigh on impossible at the moment!
"@Debbie - EasyJet will contact you later, you fly first 16 May, it is more than one month, so be patient.During the month can change many things and they wait with to inform you.I fly next week and already got message from just EasyJet about the flight. So don't be worry, they will contact you when it is time.Edited: 7:43 am, March 14, 2020 "
Morocco is a third world country and I would imagine that it does not have the resources or medical ability to deal with corona virus and maybe has not got official statistics as all moroccan healthcare has to be paid for by the patient - I lived there fore 11 years and can say in all honesty that the public hospitals for locals were a disgrace and did not represent hospitals as we know them in developed countries
"Khamlia, I idd not mean anything wrong - just know the medical system in Morocco, Many people prefer to let die their grandparents instead of bring ing them to hospitals telling it is very expensive etc etc...just this. I am sorry it id sounded like this but was not absolutely meant in this was, so sorry....I wish that all the world is safe place with no i wars and violence, no will of individuals to rule the world, we are from one planet and we are all the same. I hope you understand me now....and soryr once again."
"No no Marketa, it's OK, I understood how you meant and I wrote it too.@lisaberlin - But look at this list - https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/you say ""the public hospitals for locals were a disgrace"" - I agree I saw it myself, but they have good doctors who do much to take care of theirs sick, I know it of own experienceBut explain to me why so many people in Europe, USA where the health system is more developed than in third world. On the list you will see how many are recovered in third world and how many are recovered in our countries.Edited: 10:23 am, March 14, 2020 "
A friend of mine in Marrakech has written that it is a scary time in Marrakech and that Corona virus has hit Morocco. The drs might be good but they do not have the facilities in the local public hospitals and they have a different ethos - when I was there if you did not pay up front you got no help and a friend of mine's mother died in one of these local hospitals simply because the approach to medicine is different. Be aware of this but also note that there are private clinics and hospitals which are better but the attitude of the staff is the same - pay up front or you do not get help!
"It is not only there, but also in Sweden, for example. I know, a sick person with a broken shoulder did not get help first and then paid, on the contrary, she first had to pay then she could come to the doctor"
Are you not concerned that they may block all flights to and from the uk. I am supposed to be going on Monday 16th but my partner says he doesn't want to get stranded there.
"We have just returned from a week in Marrakesh. You have to fill out a medical sheet on arrival, this was given to us on the plane before we landed. It was very quiet in Marrakesh especially the medina. Gatwick airport was not busy and our hotel was not busy."
We were due to holiday next week :(maybe old news now -https:/…morocco

"Please go to the supermarket. There's plenty of food. Some restaurants are still doing delivery and takeout.There are grocers' shops everywhere that should be open - they are open elsewhere in Morocco. I don't see why they shouldn't be open in Marrakech. Even after the commencement of the army-regulated lockdown tonight, food shops will stay open.Get a flat for a day or two if you can't stay in a hotel.Improvise."
Right Paula. I see from another post that you are a bit incoherent here. You're safely home and spreading misinformation - it looked as though you were still in Marrakech.I'll advise anyone still stuck to ignore these ramblings. There's plenty of food. Just do what I advised in post #53.
"read my post again, I got home yesterday and my hotel closed at 10pm so I had no choice but to leave, other hotels around us and the medina were either closed or had a deadline for 12 tonight to close down and airport. shops are closed and the odd supermarket that are there you can buy food but were are you going to cook it and were are you going to stay, no one will find a room as you suggested, maybe you would go buy a tent, but I like to shower and eat at a table and not the floor. so stop being negative about this situation because its real( solomanbinding) ."
"Make sandwiches? Eat cakes and savoury quiche from bakers' shops? Get a takeaway? Eat fruit? I honestly don't know if airbnb are still operating. If they are, you could use them. If not, there are loads of local estate agencies that would help out.Eating on the floor? Not having a shower for a day? First world problems. Just adapt and have an adventure. Just to repeat. Paula is spreading misinformation. There's loads of food, there are loads of places to get it from. Even after 6pm today when the proper lockdown will start, food shops and supermarkets will be open, as will chemists and doctors' surgeries. Right up to now, very small snack places are selling food either takeaway or to sit in - I have just walked past several. I imagine this will cease after 6pm and they will become takeaway only.Now, I will add one thing, Paula. I am sure your holiday being ruined was a shock and disappointment. I'm sorry it turned out that way with extra financial costs that you are unlikely to recoup. But posting incorrect assertions on this thread won't help you or your situation. Nor will it help anyone else here who wasn't as lucky as you were already to have got out."
"@ paula pI can assure you as of this afternoon you could still easily get cooked food to go at restaurants, fast food and ready to eat meals at the many grocery stores that are open.I will add locals were volunteering to hose travelers stuck in Marrakech.I will add that TA has instituted a no misinformation about this virus policy. So posts like this can be removed."
"Currently in Camping Municipal, Ouarzazate, Tafilelt, Morocco. On lockdown with only one person per party allowed out for shopping and emergencies with a police permit. Curfew from 18:00-06:00. Great people running the camping; if you can’t get out the Boss, Ayoub will get you anything. No info from British Embassy in Rabat, just generic automated emails. Still, we are keeping our spirits up; plenty of food and drink available."
"You probably won't hear from the Embassy until they have some valid news for you, silence doesn't mean nothing is happening. I have several friends and contacts in a similar position. On the positive side the weather is nice, costs are low and you are in a relatively safe place.You may not be able to leave, so as Ramadan approaches (23 April?) make sure you build up your wine and beer stocks if that is important to you.Feel free to post updates on the 'stuck in morocco' thread at https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g293…"
"I hope you changed your mind anyway flights are suspended thankfully so people like you shouldn't put others lives at risk!!! THINK, engage brain!"
Family have a hol booked 31.08.2020 will we still be able to travel it's at marrakech
"I have just read an article in bladi.net that there is no possibility of Royal Air Maroc restarting flights before September. Now, the article doesn't make clear whether this is because the government will ban them till then or whether it's an operational decision by the airline. So I don't know if other carriers will be landing in Morocco or even if the borders will be open and under which conditions,I guess my advice might be hope for the best but prepare for the worst. No one knows yet."
"I think it will be ""the best but prepare for the worst"""
