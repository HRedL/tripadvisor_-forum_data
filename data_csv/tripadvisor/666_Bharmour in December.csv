"Hi Rishabh,Too tough to predict for December now. But seems it will be possible looking at historic data. But better look for predictions in October/ November about rains. the temp will be fine not too cold. Snow will not be there except the peaks. The only thing to look out for will be early morning fog. In day it can be sunny for couple of hours.I see no issues, but keep a check in November over weather. CheerS!Luv."
I want to enjoy snow and want to see snow fall.
I want to see snow fall and want to play in snow
"Given the current rises cases of COVID-19, it is unlikely that Himachal government will resume travel sector this year. Plan accordingly."
