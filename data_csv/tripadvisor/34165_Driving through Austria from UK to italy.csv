"Was planning to drive through Austria to Italy for family in Italy from the German border.From a previous posting it looks as though there are no border checks, though can you pass through the country? Assume that the car registration gets picked up, though it is the people who are restricted and not the border crossing itself....Alternatively I can drive down to Italy via France, though was heading to NE Italy."
"I believe non-stop transit is permitted. That has been the case before, where restrictions were more severe - even people who could not enter Austria were still allowed to transit through it, providing they don't make any stops.Contact your local Austrian embassy via an e-mail, to check whether this still applies.Edited: 3:22 am, June 21, 2020 "

Which implies it directly from that country. Other sites say “so long as not been in uk for the past 14days” so it is not clear and conflicting information.
"i must admit that i would not be considering such a journey at present as the rules can change depending on spikes etc. you could end up being locked down in italy ! further, when you return to the uk, you willhave to serve a 14 day quarantine as well. of course, all this can change"
"NikJ: Using the link posted in #2, it will by default show entry restrictions. However, you're asking about transit, which has different rules. If you click on the transit icon, this is what will show:""May I transit this country?YesTransit without further stops in Austria is allowed.""It therefore seems that the original rule is still in place and as long as you won't make any stops in Austria, you can transit without any issues, even if you are otherwise unable to enter Austria.#4 - Almost all EU states allowed transit to the home country throughout the crisis, even at its peak. OP would most likely be able to travel back home, even if another round of lockdowns occured (which is unlikely, several countries already announced there will be no more lockdowns, even if there is a second wave).Edited: 7:16 am, June 21, 2020 "
"Entry Requirements for UK CitizensNon-essential travel between the UK and Austria is currently strongly discouraged by both the Austrian and the UK government. Whilst we very much look forward to a time when we'll be able to welcome you back as usual, there is currently no specific date set by the Austrian government when this will be the case.If you have to travel (for instance, for medical reasons or for work), you can enter Austria as a UK citizen if: You can produce a health certificate in German or English, which is not older than four days and which confirms that the molecular biological test for SARS-CoV-2 is negative, OR You agree to a self-monitored 14-day quarantine immediately upon arrival.When you return to the UK, you will need to self-quarantine for 14 days."
