"TASHKENT – Day 1, 2 and 12We flew from Almaty to Tashkent on Air Astana. The ticket cost us $112 for the 1 way. Once we landed, I got money from the ATM machine in the Departures Building and called Yandex. Our ride cost 12500 som. We stayed at the Alliance Hotel which was a 10 minute ride away. You can see my separate review on Alliance. It was a new hotel with nice rooms and we paid around $50 per night. At first we were skeptical since the last time we had such a cheap room, it was in Kathmandu and we had neither heat nor hot water. But the Alliance was nice. We had AC and plenty of hot water. The only downside was it was about a 15 minute walk to the Oybek Metro station.Speaking of metro stations, we did our own little DIY tour. We marked down the stations of interest and just went around seeing them for ourselves. You buy a token at the cashier for 1400 som and the cost is the same regardless of how many stops. Each station was unique and some were utterly gorgeous. It was such a fun excursion for us. Also, you don’t need the Russian name of the station. You can actually go into the station and take picture of the map with your phone. Even though there are multiple lines, the metro was pretty easy to navigate.In Tashkent, we went to Timur Square, Victims of Repression Memorial, Minor Mosque, Barakhan Madrasa, Dzhuma Mosque and Chorsu market. None of these places required any entrance fee. When we couldn’t get to a place via the metro, we would Yandex. If you go to Chorsu Market and you are looking for the area that are grilling meats, it isn’t the easiest to find because it isn’t marked on Google Maps and the area is large. You will find these BBQ stalls east of the circular building. If you locate “Obzhornyye Ryady Rynka Corsu” on Google Maps, you should be able to find it. At one point, we just had to follow the smell.We enjoyed Tashkent more than we thought we would even though it is a big city. There is plenty to see and you can easily spend half a day just visiting the unique metro stations alone. Don’t skip Tashkent and write it off as another capital city. It is certainly worth at least a day of your time."
"KHIVA – Day 3, 4We flew Uzbekistan Airways to Urgench. For some reason, I couldn’t buy the tickets on the Uzbekistan Airways website. I had to use Expedia. Our tickets cost $60 for the one way. Pretty affordable and better than the train which would take hours. Our flight time was 1 hour.I arranged for Islambek Travel to pick us up. We paid $10 for the 45 minute ride. Even our hotel Arkanchi quoted me $12. I highly recommend them. Islambek also arranged our transfer from Khiva to the Shavat Border for Turkmenistan and from the Farap Border to Bukhara and they had the best prices after I asked around.We spent 2 nights at Arkanchi Hotel and paid $38 per night. Of all our hotels in Uzbekistan, Arkanchi had the BEST location. Not the best room but it was steps from the Kalta Minor Minaret (otherwise known as the unfinished minaret). The story here is that the architect who built it left town and didn’t finish it because the Khan who he was building it for threatened to kill him when he finished it because he promised another Khan he would build another taller minaret for him.We bought the VIP tickets for Khiva for 150000 som per person. This gave us access to all the museums as well as entrance to watch the sunset at Kuhna Ark (recommend this) and to climb the Islam Khoja Minaret. The ticket was good for 3 days. I do have to say that some of the museums were not worth going into and this ticket didn’t cover the Pakhlavan Mahmud Mausoleum which we paid an extra 10000 som for entry. But I do recommend going into the Pakhlavan Mahmud Mausoleum. Not a big place but the blue tile is gorgeous. This ticket also does not include Nurullaboy Hovllilari Palace which wanted 50000 som per person. We opted not to go into this. When I asked the Tourist Information office about this, they said it will be included soon. Not sure when soon will be….Don’t forget to walk the city walls. If it’s hot, do it in the morning or around sunset. We did it around 2 pm and it did get quite hot as there is obviously no cover.If you are in Khiva, you have to try the Shivit Oshi Green Noodles. This is where they originated. I recommend trying it at Café Zorafshon.Also, we really enjoyed eating at Terrassa Café. They have a rooftop which is perfect for watching the sunset. You get the same view as Kuhna Ark which is very popular at sunset. The staff is super friendly. You can even make a reservation for a table which we did. Khiva was our favorite city. I love how there are no cars within the walls. You feel completely transported in time. We liked walking around at night when the minaret and watchtower was all lit up. We went out at night to take night shots. Sometimes, it seemed like we had the whole place to ourselves. I think 1.5 days here at a leisurely pace is perfect. You can enjoy a longer lunch and the city is not touristy. Probably because it isn’t as easy to get to as Bukhara and Samarkand.The one place I did wish we visited was the Aral Sea. Such an interesting story about that area. If anyone is looking to do this, Islambek Travel offers a 1 day tour but it is a long day."
"BUKHARA – Day 5, 6, 7We arrived to Bukhara from Turkmenistan and spent 3 nights here. We stayed at Komil Bukhara for 3 nights for $54 per night. The actual location was fine except they were doing street work and dug up the entire street it was on. It was literally dirt and didn’t make going into and coming out of the hotel very pleasant. We also didn’t like the hotel not helping us with find a taxi but subjecting us to their own vehicle for 100% more in pricing.Bukhara was the only city where everything I read about the admission fees were completely wrong. It seemed like everything was double from what I read. Or, I read there was no entrance charged and then there would be entrance. For example, at Ulugbek Madrasah they asked for 5000 som but only shopping stalls were inside. Unlike Khiva where you pay 1 price for multiple places, in Bukhara you pay separate entrance fees.At Ark of Bukhara, we were charged 30000 som per person. And the price list was all in Uzbek and I couldn’t make out what it said because it was literally a whole page of pricing. Also, I feel like we got scammed because we got 2 receipts for 30000 som. Then the person who scanned us in, took 1 of the tickets. It is as if to sell to someone else and make 30000 off them. And to add insult to injury, there was nothing to see inside. Save yourself some som and don’t bother going inside. The outside is worth a visit but not the interior.We went inside Kalon Mosque and the person selling books asked for 6000 som per person. But he didn’t ask everyone for money. And there is no price list there or receipt given. All in all, we just felt like Bukhara was the only place taking advantage of tourists and there was some shady business going on. Samanid Mausoleum is worth the extra walk to get there. We actually took a taxi and then walked back towards town. However, even if you walk both ways, it isn’t very far. There is an entrance fee but there is no need to pay it since you can see everything from the door. The outside is the interesting part of this building. Same with Chor Minor. A little bit of a walk but worth it. I read you can climb one of the minarets for a fee but when we got there, no one was going inside. We couldn’t climb the Kalon Minaret either even though I read you could. The story behind this minaret is that Genghis Khan destroyed everything around it but spared the minaret because he said it was too beautiful to destroy. It certainly was beautiful. Criminals were also executed when they were tossed from the top. We felt we spent 1 night too many here. We could have done everything in 1 day and left in all honesty. For various reasons, Bukhara wasn't our favorite.The one highlight of our trip was eating at Ayvan Restaurant inside Lyabi House. We loved it so much we ate dinner here twice. I know people have mentioned it is expensive but it really is not. The first night we ordered a bottle of red wine, soup, salad, pasta and even with the 15% service fee, it came out to be 170000 som. That is literally just $18! Pasta was great and the place is gorgeous. It’s like 5 star dining at 1 star prices."
I just wanted to say thank you for taking the time to write this! Very helpful for planning my trip there!
@Sarah - thanks! Glad the info is helping you. Enjoy your trip!
This is really full of basic information that you don't get anywhere. I will be showing this to our friend as we plan our visit. Thank you.
"Thanks so much for your full report! How did you buy train tickets, alone or through agency? And how far in advance did you buy them? Thank you"
"@Piglet44 - when I bought the train tickets, I didn't go through an agency because I didn't want to pay a high markup.I bought the tickets exactly 45 days before travel because that was the first time I could buy them online. At the time, it was the official Uzbekistan website that allowed for US credit cards. However, since then, this website is no longer available to purchase train tickets. Since then, there is a new website. http://railway.uz/enYou still need to set up an account using your email address and a password. It helps to know the Cyrillic Names of the stations. Here they are below:Bukhara = БУХАРА 1Samarkand = САМАРКАНДTashkent = ТАШКЕНТKhiva = ХИВАYou can check how many seats are available and the pricing here. However, it looks like now your passport issuing country is also in Cyrillic which also makes it tricky.However, from everything I read, you cannot purchase the tickets with a foreign credit card. And I also found this statement on their website ""Currently, only cards of national payment systems of Uzbekistan are accepted for payment. In the near future, payment will be launched through the international payment systems Visa and Master Card. Specialists are working on this.""Caravanistan has a forum with this topic and the last update someone made was November. You might want to post a question there as well.https://caravanistan.com/forum/viewtopic.php…You can also reach out to them to see how much their pricing ishttps:/…commentsGood luck!"
Hi -- Thanks for your great review on Uzbekistan. I am currently working out details for my solo trip there next year. I only speak English. Do you think this wil be an issue?
@cwalts - we don't speak Russian / Uzbek either and managed fine just speaking English. Enjoy your trip!
"Thank you so much for such detailed and practical information. Immensely helpful and extremely reassuring. Thanks again,Freya"
"Many thanks, PandaHouston, for this excellent information!We will have 7 full days in Uzbekistan (plus 2 days to fly there and back). Right now I am thinking of the following itinerary:Day 1: Tashkent + take evening train to SamarkandDay 2: SamarkandDay 3: Samarkand + take late afternoon train to BukharaDay 4: BukharaDay 5: Bukhara + take train or private taxi to Khiva early in the afternoon so that we can see a bit of Khiva in the eveningDay 6: Khiva + half day trip to Ayoz qalʼaDay 7: Take morning flight to Tashkent and spend the rest of the day thereDoes that seem doable in your opinion? I know it's a compromise, but we are used to intense itineraries.Edited: 4:54 pm, December 14, 2019 "
"@PP Ams - definitely doable. Sounds like a great itinerary. Try to book your train / transport in advance because the fast train often sells out and you don’t have much time to waste. Like you said, it will be intense but there’s nothing wrong with that. :)"
"Amazing report ! Thank you. I saved it all so I can go over it slowly, as I'm planning 2 weeks trip next Spring."
@DorotaY - Thanks! Glad you found the info helpful!
thank you so much for your thorough review.i am considering a trip in Oct 2020 to Uzbekistan.i am crazy about the textiles and curious about the country.what do you think about a middle-aged woman traveling alone in Uzbekistan?
"Thanks anamericaninparis. I really loved Uzbekistan. One of my favorite countries and I've been to quite a few! I read that Uzbekistan is considered one of the safest countries for solo female travelers. Before our visit, I read a few blogs from solo female travelers who confirmed as much. I would just use the normal caution when travelling. Be aware of your surroundings and don't put yourself in situations you are not comfortable in. If you go, I think you will find that Uzbekistan has some of the most friendliest people. Minus the occasional taxi driver. :)"
PandaHouston-thanks for the detailed reports with lots helpful info. hope to make the trip in early april as I am planning a Beijing - Almaty - Tashkent - Bukhara - Samarkand - Dushanbe - Beijing route for 10 some days. hope this new Wuhan virus gets under control soon.
"@bangzi - Thank you! Yes, hopefully the coronavirus situation gets resolved quickly."
"Yes hopefully it does get under control soon. Cannot stand the paranoia.100 children so far this season have dies of the flu, 10,000 seniors too- in the USA alone. But you don't see the hysteria that you are getting with this virus.Certainly puts a damper on travel to say nothing to the stock market"
"@PandaHoustonWonderful, detailed and informative report- appreciate that. We are planning to spend 8-9 days in Uzbekistan early October. Direct flights to Houston from Dubai by Turkish Airlines is a big help.Given we are going so far on our trip I would like to take an extra 5-7 days and take in another country but not sure which one. Would appreciate your input. We are in our mid 60's, love historical sights but also nature. Cannot do strenuous hikes presently because of wife's knee issues and at this stage would rather not rough it in hostels and will rather go for mid level hotels.. Would appreciate your thoughts on which country you would recommend"
"@paparam - thanks for the compliments.As part of this trip, we spent 3 nights in Baku, 1 night in Bishkek, 2 nights in Almaty, 2 nights in Turkmenistan and 1 night in Tajikistan. You probably don't want anything hectic like that with 1 or 2 nights here and there. However, of the 5 Stans, other than Uzbekistan, I thought Turkmenistan was the most eye opening and interesting. However, you will need to reach out to a travel agency. If you want to do something on your own, I thought Baku was relaxing and easy to visit on your own and the city itself was very walkable. And since you mentioned Turkish Airlines, if you haven't spent time in Istanbul, I think that is well worth a visit. And even cities outside of Istanbul like Cappadocia is worth a few days. I think Turkey offers a lot of history (Istanbul, Ephesus) and nature (Cappadocia).In a couple of months, we are actually heading to Georgia and Armenia which I am quite excited about. You might consider either of those countries since there is quite of bit of history there and lots of mountains for the nature aspect.Not sure if this is helpful but maybe it will give you some ideas."
@PandaHoustonThank you for your input. We have done Istanbul/Cappadocia and highly recommend that to anyone who hasn’t. Thinking of doing Azerbaijan/ Armenia/Georgia in one trip perhaps next year.Will look into getting a tour company for Turkmenistan although must say am a little spooked about the old Soviet type of Bureaucracy. Alternatively will spend 4 days between Bishkek and Almaty.
"@paparamI agree that people usually do Caucasus (Azerbaijan/Armenia/Georgia) together. We were considering doing all these together with the 5 Stans last year but it would have been a really long trip so we broke it out to do it this year. I just hope that by the time we travel, the coronavirus is more under control.Only if you are interested, we used a tour company called Owadan for Turkmenistan. I have a review of them here:https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-…Here is a bit of information of how we went from Uzbekistan to Turkmenistan and then back to Uzbekistan. I do have to say logistically it made a lot of sense to both of these countries together.https:/…105622683"
Another DIY report mentioned people getting regularly sick - did you find that ?
"@rowanother - not sure I understand the question? We didn't have any issues with anyone getting sick during our trip.Edited: 5:55 pm, February 22, 2020 "
"Wow PandHouston, amazing description of your trip. Thank you so much for taking the time. I am travelling there on April, and have the same doubt on whether we should visit the Aral Sea."
"@DavidFVCol - thank you! If you do visit Aral Sea, please post your experience. I would be very curious to know!"
Thank you. Very helpful
"Thanks for all the great information.I have my fingers crossed for my 5 Stans trip, October 2021."
@SuPa25 - Thanks! Good luck to you! The 5 Stans was one of my favorite all time trips.
