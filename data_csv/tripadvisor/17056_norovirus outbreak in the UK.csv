"hello, sorry to share bad news but are you aware that there is a Major epidemic of norovirus going on currently all over the UK? please be very careful about washing hands thoroughly before eating anything. stay well and be careful."
"Er, yes, we are all well aware of it thanks. It's not actually 'all over the UK' yet and to be honest, I don't know of anybody who has contracted it yet so it's hardly epidemic proportions.There's normally some bug or other doing the rounds in temperate zones but there's hardly need to panic"
"in excess of 200,000 cases per week and rising."
"100,000 the last I heard - and it's also in New Zealand"
Oh my God! Put the closed sign up at the airports! Britain is a major health risk to visitors! Do you never have colds or flu in Hawaii? 
"In fairness to mauna kea lady (we were there, btw! Wonderful place), this from the Telegraph:""Up to 200,000 people a week are expected to contract norovirus over the next month as the disease reaches its seasonal peak. This winter cases are already double the number seen last year and are at the highest level for five years. Doctors have urged anyone who is suffering sickness and diarrhoea to stay away from A&E and GP surgeries to avoid spreading it and call for advice is symptoms persist for more than a few days.""This is an annual occurrence, but does seem to be getting worse, although the illness itself, whilst contagious, is usually self-limiting, but obviously you don't want it ruining your holiday. My advice? Stay away from hospitals, schools, nursing homes and cruise ships.And yes, use hand wipes. "
"this is not some kind of criticism. I simply think travelers need to be aware of this, so they can prevent getting it. "
Isn't it amazing what affect these new posh words for traditional winter ailments can have? There is a perceptive and amusing article in today's Times on this subject. timesonline.co.uk/tol/â€¦article3142021.ece
"Isn't it what I always used to call ""a cold""?"
"Maybe not ""a cold"", GB - don't think I've ever heard throwing up for 24 hours called ""a cold"", but maybe that's just me. But it's really just a nasty tummy bug - unless you're in a particularly ""at risk"" group then it's not going to do you much harm, you'll just feel vile for a day or two."
"well, this is more than just an inconvenient little winter flu. according to today's Daily Mail:""Vomiting Cases to soar as millions head back to work: parents are urged today to disinfect TV remote controls, computer keyboards and phones to protect their families from the sickness bug sweeping the country. The advice comes as experts fear the number of cases of norovirus - which causes uncontrollable pojectile vomiting - will soar this week as millions return to work and school after the Christmas break. No part of the country has escaped the clutches of the vomiting bug, which is claiming up to 200,000 victims a week and costing the economy an estimated 40 million GBP a day in lost productivity. Some 100 hospital wards were closed to new admissions last week in a desperate attempt to halt the march of the virus, which is 100,000 times more infectious than Salmonella..."""
"Alright then, a bad cold with belly ache..:-))By the way, if you can catch salmonella from badly defrosted chicken, can you get chickenella from badly defrosted salmon?Today's point-to-ponder......as you can see, I've got nothing better to do......"
Norovirus? Throwing up? Can't keep anything down for 48 hours? Sounds like a great way to lose those excess pounds put on at Christmas. Beats the Malaria diet I recommended to a friend last summer.
"And the Daily Mail has never exaggerated, has it? No, but seriously, it is nasty. But I had it last year, and honestly, if you're an otherwise healthy individual, it entails spending 24 hours surgically attached to a toilet and another few days feeling a bit wobbly. It's serious when it's in hospitals because obviously the people in the hospital are already weak. But otherwise the majority of people can cope with it."
"well, TripAdvisor's credo is ""get the truth. then go."" So the truth is that this is the worst Norovirus outbreak in 5 years, it is currently spreading like wildfire in the UK, and hasn't hit its peak yet.it may not be a serious disease, but it can really ruin part of your trip.and all you have to do to avoid getting it is to wash your hands obsessivley before eating anything.forewarned is forearmed."
"""and all you have to do to avoid getting it is to wash your hands obsessivley before eating anything.""Unfortunately that's not 100% true, but yes, it will certainly significantly lower your chances. Washing your hands ""obsessively"" before eating doesn't mean you have zero chance of getting it, sadly..."
"I've got family all over the country, as many people do and I don't know anyone who has ever had it. The figures sounds scary at 100,000 a week (not 200,000 yet) but it helps if you are careful as you go about your day, keeping hands clean and that kind of thing. I've always been a bit obsessive about avoiding door handles, and tap handles so if you see a brown haired 5'2"" female opening doors with elbows or hands inside her sleeves, then don't forget to say hi;-)Nothing wrong with giving people a heads-up, but I wouldn't get too worried. Just be aware."
"""get the truth. then go."" So, what you read in the British papers is the truth then, is it? 100,000 new cases per week, alledgedly, a populationof 60 million yet nobody here knows anyone who's caught it.Sound's like the truth, doesn't it?"
"Ah but DC, the 'powers that be' love a good scare story. Keeps us natives from getting restless. Be careful out there;-)"
"Mauna, thanks for the update but as i live in the UK I can re-assure everyone that there is no epidemic of any kind. What tends to happen in the UK is that our media grab a little story and blow it up out of all proportion. Its a curiousity of the British way of life. we love a big drama and something to moan about ! so rest assured,there has not been an outbreak of plague."
"for anyone who would like to verify independent sources about this may google ""norovirus outbreak"" and get the information for yourself. there are up to date reports from numerous and reputable news agencies about the various outbreaks in England."
"I understand your concern and your desire to warn people and yes we should be careful but then we should be careful all the time especially in places such as schools and hospitals where germs can spread quickly and in places where crowds gather. Mrs H is a nurse and she tells me that this sort of thing happens all year round not just in winter and of course it is a problem for hospitals as staff go off sick but honestly certain sections of our media (The Daily Mail being a prime example) delight in these type of scare stories, not just relating to health but with regard to the economy (""thousands affected by new mortgage crisis"") or s*x (""soap star in collapse shock""). They think it sells newspapers. Sadly they are often right."
"I'm a bit confused about the figures. If they are telling people not to go to their GP or A&E, how can they have the foggiest idea as to the numbers? Unless, of course, they get their figures from the number of people who phone into work sick, which I certainly foresee rising."
"MKL: I can understand your concern, but I've just got DH to do the maths, and it's something like 0.3% of the population.You may wonder why we Brits are being so blase about this 'epidemic'? Well, basically, it'll have to wait its turn behind the avian flu and mad cow disease epidemics the government promised us a while back..."
"Don't Panic! Our hard-working Prime Minister will fix it right away.""Ill people - stay away from surgeries and hospitals!""That ought to do it....next?"
"As I was reading this thread, I kept thinking about the avian flu that was going to reach epidemic proportions in the US. It was on the news (and in everybody's e-mails) here for weeks and weeks. Ho hum, did anybody ever get it except a half-dozen workers on chicken farms somewhere in Asia? What the media failed to report is that about 36,000 (yes that's thirty-six thousand) people die each and every year in the US from plain ol' flu.I guess scaremongering does sell newspapers and TV ads ... and gets a little time on forums :-( "
"Thank God I'm a bloke - at least I won't get bird flu...I don't know anyone who's caught this virus thing - as usual, it's simply the newspapers creating a scare story to sell their rags. It's probably quite nasty for the very young, the very old, or for someone who is already ill, but for the vast majority of us, I shouldn't even concern ourselves with it."
"mauna key lady- There would be little point in googling because all you would be faced with is a list of sensationalist reports from the press !The UK is cold and wet a large part of the year. The odd sniff and sneeze is par for the course.If people read the postings in the press,then it would be easy to think we were all suffering from the black death.This so called outbreak or epidemic is nothing of the sort and is totally inconsequential to the vast majority of the population.Part of the reason why it might be erroneously claimed as being an epidemic is that many Brits latch onto a story like this and calim to be afflicted,so that they can stay off work !"
"I have a teenager and the school have been taking precautions like making sure soap dispensers in toilets are checked more often. However I have yet to hear of a case. My wife and child went to London recently and one came back with a bit of a sniffle. It's winter, there are viruses around. Wash your hands carefully, especially between the fingers - which most people miss. And you can buy tablets called diareze/immodium/loperamide in any pharmacy (Boots is a big chain) for a couple of pounds if you find you have an upset stomach. It's what I used for my flight back from Brazil, although I did need antibotics once I got back. "
"We don't have that problem at my daughter's school, buzzard... they installed CCTV cameras apparently, and now children are avoiding going to the toilet at all at school :-("
"Mauna Key, if you are still reading this: 200,000 was their projected figure and just as with the projected figures for Bird Flu, Mad Cow etc; the actual numbers are nowhere near. As everyone has said, the press love a bit of sensation and it was probably they who made up that number and not the NHS! My admin lady turned up to work last Monday and said her husband had had it, she did not contract it from him and neither did any of us, but once someone gets a cold we are all done for! So it's really not as bad as all that. I never contracted NV working on ships, and it's always lurking around in some dark corner. If you have a reasonable immune system and standard of hygiene, it does not pose too much risk. Unless of course, you are elderly or infirm - and then there are other things to worry about like Legionarres and such.There is no Major Epidemic here!"
"small article in the Guardian today confirming that there never was an epidemic. The Health Protection Agency have now released actual figures showing that infections this winter were no higher than in previous years. To quote ""Steve Field, the chairman of the Royal College of General Practioners, said that the scare over the virus may have helped to reduce its spread by encouraging good hygiene"""
Well fancy that!And here's me believing that everything printed in newspapers is true.
"So we're not going to all die a painful, sweaty mid-wintry vomiting pile of hideous death? ah bugger. the mail is wrong! does that mean diana isnt dead? "
Only in the mind of al-Fayed.Maybe Mauna Kea Lady owes Britain an apology for needless scaremongering.A visit to the Tower beckons!
Doesnt seemed to have harmed us much.Only 1 1/2 non-Brits responded and they laughed it off as well.Not sure who the OP was targeting but it clearly didnt work.
"well I would love to be wrong about this...hopefully you are all correct, and there is no validity to these news reports. I must say I really enjoyed reading everyone's comments - glad to know that the british sense of humor is still alive and well."
If the thread goes quiet now its probably cos we have all died. :)
"Or we are having to spend a LOT of time ""elsewhere"""
"Well, sorry to say this but mauna kea lady IS CORRECT - I caught the dreaded bug last night and have just woken up to find that I've died in my sleep."
"Ah bless her, she was only concerned for our health. Maybe Hawwaii receive breaking news on UK news quicker than we do? I hope none of Mauna's friends have cancelled hols to Blighty on the strength of it!"
"Hi stooginhoCompletely agree - it's good to hear of folk who are worried for us and our little island. Mauna kea lady - thank you for your concern. As you can see, I have been fully revived....."
"well, make sure you stay indoors for a couple of days as they advise, even when you think your symptoms are over. Otherwise we are all done for! "
Don't believe everything you read in the papers!
"Why ever not? - I believe EVERYTHING I read in them. Elvis was spotted riding Red Rum through the Brittox in Devizes last Tuesday, must be true because that's what it says today in the Wilts Gazette and Herald and they're always right....."
well if we don't believe the papers perhaps the Grauniad is all wrong and we've all died......and I am a figment of my imagination.
