"Hi Everyone,I have my yearly trip to the Capri in late July and I am wondering if you guys think it will be possible o go. I'm also going to Positano and Ischia. It's already payed and I dont want the money back just to travel."
"How would anyone here know? It is far too early to know what will even be happening by next week (in Italy or anywhere)- let alone months from now.I'd wait to cancel because if flights are canceled, you should get a refund - as to non-refundable accommodations, that's up to the individual properties."
"Obviously here, in Italy we have a magic crustal ball to answer such showering questions..."
"The biggest unknown is whether international borders will reopen for tourists, without a requirement to self-quarantine for 14 days. Obviously, tourism becomes impossible if there remains a period of mandatory quarantine. The ""travel and leisure"" segment ""hangs together"", in the sense that to allow tourism into the country signifies reopening restaurants, bars, museums and hotels."

"By ""ok"" do you mean will they have dealt with all the bodies?"
@ 8 they cremate all the dead bodies it does not take long as they did back in the day 100s of years ago when an epidemic hit they also would torch the whole town.
"You also have to take into account any travel restrictions in both Italy and your home country-- like whether or not they have been lifted by the time you travel. The virus is going to be around for a while, so you need to think how you will deal with that -- are you traveling a long distance? If so, need to take precautions on any long haul flights."
