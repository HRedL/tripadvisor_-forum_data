"Hi h20: Every day we monitor Listin Diario,one of the main newspapers in Santo Domingo, and there hasn't been anything mentioned about that. Newborns have been vaccinated for T.B. in the D. R. for over 20 years. We're going next week too. Have a great trip!"

"What the ""...."" is TB?There is no epidemic of anything (besides influenza aviar) but I'm just curious about what tb is.... "
"Hola Monica!TB is an abreviation for TuberculosusHere is a brief explaination I copiedTuberculosis Also called: TB Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection caused by a germ called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The bacteria usually attack the lungs, but they can also damage other parts of the body. TB spreads through the air when a person with TB of the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes or talks. If you have been exposed, you should go to your doctor for tests. You are more likely to get TB if you have a weak immune system. Symptoms of TB in the lungs may includeA bad cough that lasts 3 weeks or longer Weight loss Coughing up blood or mucus Weakness or fatigue Fever and chills Night sweats If not treated properly, TB can be deadly. You can usually cure active TB by taking several medicines for a long period of time. People with latent TB can take medicine so that they do not develop active TB.Got this from:www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/tuberculosis.htmlbb/mt"
