"Hi there!My husband and I are planning our baby moon for the week starting 2/14. I will be 18 weeks pregnant by then. We booked through timeshare so will be staying in st Thomas for the entire week. But we are thinking of doing a couple day trips to St. John.So questions:1. We rent a small sedan. I have read that it can be difficult to drive around St. John. In Feb when it is sunny and dry, do you think we should be fine? We can leave the car at red hook and take taxi as well, but I assume we can visit more places by car.2. I really want to snorke at water lemon cay. But I worry about the hike and the swim out will need too much energy for a pregnant women. I looked up boat tours from st Thomas. It looks like they only do private charters which are super expensive. Any recommendations?3. How many day trips would folks recommend we take to St. John? Ferry tickets will start adding up but we do want to hit most of the must be places.Thanks?"
"i kept up a normal activity level all thru my pregnancy so I am pro activity while pregnant. However, everyone is different and only you will know what is good for you at that time. The walk is flat and easy. use common sense as it relates to staying hydrated. The STJ sun combined with dry air can be dehydrating.Pregnant or not, Waterlemon deserves caution. It can be calm and zero current one day and have a wicked current another. Do a search on Waterlemon and you will find lengthy threads about people that drown fighting the current and tons of posters sharing their experiences, both good and bad. Personally, I got caught in a current that was scary. (And I was a life guard with lots if open water experience). The next day there was zero current. My mom, who came barely swim, did the snorkel that day and thought it was easy.This is a long way of me saying be sure to know exactly what you may encounter when you get in the water at Waterlemon. Conditions there can change fast and the results are not to be taken lightly.Enjoy your trip! Be sure to scope out a baby trip. We started taking our son at 4 months and loved every trip with him."

"Thanks both! I will look into the other bays as well. For my last question, maybe it is better to ask this way: as a first timer to U.S. Virgin Islands, how should I split my one week time between st Thomas and St. John? Considering I need to take ferris everyday."
"My wife and I stayed in St Thomas about 10 years ago and took a compact sedan on the car ferry to St John. We got in an accident going up a very steep road and around a hairpin turn. It was not raining that day. The car did not have enough power to make the turn in perfect control. We were sideswiped by a pickup truck whose driver was not careful. No one was injured. In my opinion there is no real problem in dry weather only for very experienced St John drivers. I think it is a big mistake for you to do this.And as cleobeach wrote, Waterlemon can have a big current and you could be caught in it and be in trouble, I got caught in a current there and was 63 years at the time and it was not a good situation.I think you would be crazy to take a compact car to St John as an inexperienced driver. I also feel that it is absurd for you to consider the Waterlemon Cay snorkel. I suggest going on the passenger ferry to St John. Then take a taxi to some of the well known beaches. If you want to explore the island on your own, then rent a jeep for the day on St John. There are lots of other safer wonderful snorkeling experiences other than waterlemon cay."
"Kod, thanks for sharing your driving experience. Very valuable points! I think I would stick to the passenger ferry then.One silly question, if not having a car, where do I leave the valuables when going into the water?"
"We did a ""cheap trip"" one year staying at a condo on STT. We took the car ferry over two days. I would personally only use a jeep. Went early and did 2 beaches and lunch and returned late afternoon. Another day we took the people ferry over mid afternoon to shop/hangout in Cruz Bay.. Happy hour, dinner and just hang out...later ferry back. Car ferry does not run as late. Another day we did a boat trip to the baths, snorkel spot and Jost. By the way, we loved hanging out at Iggies at Bolongo Bay on STT. Fun Carribean night and decent food, drinks all on the beach."
"Many people do day trips with a car and are fine. I did my first three trips to stj in a car and was fine, though never saw rain. It struggled on some hills, but wih a little head start were fine and we went all over the island each trip. I honestly think snorkeling the three buoys halfway to waterlemon is a way better snorkel than the cay itself. It would be a shorter hike too."
"For trip to the baths and BVI, I found a tour from St. John (bad kitty). Are there similar tours from st Thomas as well? Or shall I just take the ferry?"
"I don't think struggling up hills with a compact car when pregnant is a good idea.I use a Drypak brand bag for my valuables that I wear securely around my neck.Check them out at Amazon, leisurepro, or scuba.com.I pretty much do surface snorkeling and my stuff stays dry. Don't do much submerging.Feel free to personal message me."
"Forgot to add that we use aloksac bags for our keys, licence, and a few$$. I shove the ting ziplock in my suit and go. They are waterproof to 200 feet, jusy press all the air out before zipping. Come in many sizes, but i use the little one like a man wallet size."
You never want to leave valuables locked in your car as this could cost you a broken window plus your valuables. I wear board shorts or bathing skirt with a zip pocket which holds my credit card and maybe a couple of twenties in case I need cash. We leave our keys in the beach bag and our camera is waterproof. No need for cell phones we leave them at villa.As for waterlemon if it's something you really want to do I say take the ride out to Annaberg as this is a beautiful ride and destination. If the bay looks calm take the flat easy walk along Leinster chances are there will be plenty of others out there and you can ask about current conditions.
"""The car did not have enough power to make the turn in perfect control.""Either a car has enough power to get up any particular hill or it doesn't. I can conceive of a theoretical scenario that requires a running start to gather momentum for an unusually steep spot, but any resulting lack of control is due to operator error, not a lack of power. On my first trip we had a Kia Rio, which is probably about as low-powered as cars get, and we had absolutely no problems. Maybe it's possible to rent a car that's poorly suited to hills, but I imagine the vast majority of cars available will work perfectly well on dry pavement. If I had a rental car on STT I'd definitely bring that to StJ rather than rely on taxis.As for valuables in the car, the universal advice for tourists anywhere is to avoid it if at all possible. If you do leave anything put it in the trunk and don't open the trunk at the place you're going to leave the car. If a thief sees you putting something in the trunk that's just as good as seeing something laying in plain sight on the front seat, and they'll happily break a window to get at the trunk release. As above, it's easy to take the things that can get wet. I'll stash a simple old-fashioned car key, but rental companies sometimes charge dearly if you lose one of the new chipped or electronic keys. I use a small AquaPac, and put the key in a small ziploc first as some added protection. Make sure it's in a secure pocket or physically connected to you. I put mine in the pocket of my shorts, and wear a diveskin while snorkeling.Assuming it's a healthy pregnancy I can't imagine any reason that it would pose any major limitations for snorkeling at 18 weeks. Even at 30 I'd think the only issue is needing another few inches of clearance over the reef. Snorkeling should be a very calm activity that doesn't require a lot of effort, as long as you don't blunder into a bad situation. Be aware of what's going on and be vigilant for currents and you should have an uneventful day. The easiest way to check for current is to just remain motionless for a bit and see if you're moving relative to the bottom. If you do find yourself in a current swim across it instead of wasting energy swimming against it. At Waterlemon the wise choice would be to make the crossing a bit south of the cay, where an outgoing current wouldn't immediately be carrying you further from shore. There's plenty of good advice about snorkeling in general on this forum if you dig a little."
Thanks for all the wonderful advices!I will check the current before attempting waterlemon. Is it reasonable to bet that trunk bay is calm the waterlemon will likely be as well? Considering they are both north facing.If current is strong I think I will try my luck at Francis and Moho? I really want to see some healthy coral and turtles:)
Francis is right down the road from Annaberg and Maho is next to Francis so yes they would be good alternatives.
"Re: the current at Waterlemon, you should assess for yourself, but you can also ask several people at the site, if there is a current. We have one local who posts here, who has stopped people to tell them there WAS a current, and was ignored. If that happens to you, I'd think twice about even trying it. For healthy corals, on the walk to Waterlemon, on the left you'll see ""poopy rocks"" out in the water (pelicans have pooped on them."" There are several spots in this area, to get in the water safely and pretty easily. There is LOTS of beautiful, healthy coral in this area. There's also a spot at the very beginning of the trail out to Waterlemon, that has easy entry, and this whole area is just a shallow field of gorgeous corals. If you swim straight out toward the bay, you'll come to a ledge where the water gets deeper. Many people see spotted eagle rays at this ledge."
"Don't expect conditions at other north shore beaches to offer a clue about the current around Waterlemon. Wind, waves, and surge may be common to all beaches facing the weather, but that's not what causes the current. There's been plenty of discussion about the current being related to tides, but I doubt that it's anywhere near as simple as the tide flowing in and out of the bay. Based on the posts here it seems to be fairly unpredictable.I'll also note that ""calm"" isn't a guarantee, either. It may be a good idea to go elsewhere when it's rough, but rough doesn't mean there will be a current. The flip side is that it can be fairly calm and still have a current. I'll *guess* that most people who find themselves in a string current though it was calm (or calm enough).I don't think many people would describe the foreground as ""calm"" but look how smooth the water is (except right against the rocks on shore) in this video of a very fast tidal current. After looking at how smooth most of the foreground current is look at how flat it is in the background. The speed is very obvious, but it's perhaps 10 times as fast as anything you could swim against, and 15 to 20 times as fast as something that you'd rather not be in.https://youtu.be/H9aPkfERc50?t=26"
Also keep an eye on any travel warnings for the zika virus: today.com/health/cdc-alert-zika-virus-may-cu…
"Car0linaGrI, oh no... This Virus thing now gets me worried. Didn't really realize before. Is mosquito problem bad in February?"
"This is the CDC warning for Puerto Rico where one case has been confirmed. FYI, the mosquitoes that transmit this virus bite during the day as well. As a pregnant woman you do need to take precautions (more than normal) as it can be serious. To date there have been no cases in the Virgin Islands. Here is the warning:…cdc.gov/travel/…zika-virus-puerto-rico"
This is really scary. I wish I had known yesterday when I could still cancel my $$$$$ flight.It is going to be a hard decision now. My ob must not know this either since she didn't warn me when I asked her about my trip.
"Oh, Shenna, didn't mean to worry you! Think it is still a rare event outside of say, Brazil; of course, do check back with your OB, keep an eye on CDC updates and as Saffie said be especially vigilant in avoiding mosquito bites!"
"Carolinagrl I think you did the right thing in bringing this up, I thought the same thing when I read this post because I heard the news reports on this the night before but did not know it had reached as far as PR already. I would not go. The consequences are too terrible to risk.Deet does not prevent all bites and the mosquitoes are prevalent year round."
"Adding to my last post the cdc is actually now advising pregnant women to postpone travel to latin america and the Caribbean. nbcnews.com/health/health-news/baby-hawaii-c…Call the airline, see if you can eork out a credit if not a refund.Edited: 4 years ago "
Perhaps you can change your flight and go somewhere else. They will probably charge you a change fee but it might be worth paying for peace of mind.
"I hesitated, but feel I must add my opinion- there is no way anyone can definitely avoid getting a mossie bite when visiting any Caribbean island, any month. You can use insect repellents, dress wisely , avoid areas without screens when indoors ,etc. but you simply cannot be sure you will not get bitten IMHO"
We took the Bad Kitty Charter and it was wonderful. It picks passengers up on St Thomas and St John. The staff was so friendly and we were able to see so much stuff! Worth the price for sure!
"""The consequences are too terrible to risk.""You could be in an accident and spend the next 30 years being fed through a tube as a result of driving to work tomorrow, but I'll bet you're not staying home.""the cdc is actually now advising pregnant women to postpone travel to latin america and the Caribbean""The article says the CDC's advice is about ""affected regions"". They list Puerto Rico, but not the USVI, which they know isn't part of PR. The page about Zika in the Caribbean only lists Haiti and Martinique as places with ongoing transmission, and the advice is for pregnant women to ""consider postponing"" travel to places with ongoing transmission. That page can be found here:…cdc.gov/travel/…zika-virus-caribbeanThe CDC also reports that unintentional falls killed 30,208 people in 2013. Motor vehicle accidents killed 33,804. Unintentional poisoning killed 38,851. Thy report that a total of 190,000 people died from all accidents. As near as I can tell they're reporting 1 US case of microcephaly, as a result of travel to Brazil.It's obviously up to each person to decide what's acceptable, but as near as I can tell a reasonable plan would be to go ahead with the trip to St John. While there it would be a good idea to use insect repellent, wear a seat belt, and be careful around stairs and other steep places."
"I think you are missing the point. This is not the same as potentially being in an accident. If a pregnant woman contracts this virus, the result can be catastrophic. Some people can have the virus and be asymptomatic. This virus has been found in Puerto Rico which is why the travel notice was issued. No, that is not the USVI, but where do you think most of the aircraft come from - this is one of the ways mosquitoes travel. So although the risk of getting it is probably low, the result if you do is not worth it IMO. Plus I imagine that this would be something that the person would worry about the entire trip. You cannot protect yourself 100% from mosquito bites despite taking precautions. I have never gone to the Caribbean without getting mosquito bites despite consistently using Deep Woods Off. And STJ is one of the worst places I have ever been for bites (sorry but true)."
"Normally I would agree with your risk assessment Steve, but as Saffie said the potential results for a pregnant woman and her child can be truly tragic. Also, I think this virus may be ""flying under the radar""; to elaborate on what Saffie mentioned, while it is true Zika has not yet been diagnosed in the USVI the CDC reports that only 1 in 5 people who contract the virus shows symptoms, and for those who do the symptoms can be so mild they may not seek medical attention-- therefore no diagnosis and no reporting. The spread of the virus is also predicted to follow the same pattern as dengue which I believe has impacted the USVI. Of course everyone has to come to their own decision but it is an evolving situation and something to be aware of."
"Steve it is absolutely not the same , no one chooses to get in an accident and they are unavoidable/not within our control. As a pregnant woman you do have the choice of avoiding traveling to a region in the midst of a potential outbreak, the PR is too close for comfort imho. And I said I would not go I did not say she should not go as that is her perogative.Unlike Dengue which just makes most sick this can cause severe birth defects/death to the infant. Considering most womsn won't even have a glass of wine during their pregnancy I'd assume they wouldn't want to risk this either.Edited: 4 years ago "
well said NJ
"IMHO most cases of Dengue in the islands go unreported. If someone comes home from vacation in endemic area, has symptoms, and goes to a primary care provider, they will most likely get a diagnosis of ""flu like illness or virus"". Unless the doc is infectious disease specialist- tropical disease- the dengue will probably not be diagnosed. A blood test is required for correct diagnosis. If the person is fortunate to not have the severe form, hemorrhagic, they will recover. This is the frightening thing about this new- dengue like disease. Just my take on this issue-"
seems a bit blown out of proportion to me.... should we also ship out every local resident whose pregnant just to be safe? BTW the semi tropical and dry forests of St. John are very different from Brazil and the Amazon jungles of South America. Florida seems a hell of a lot more dangerous to me!February and March are typically the driest months of the year resulting in the fewest mosquitos. Wear pants in the morning and sunset. Use bug spray if you like.... but that probably causes health problems too! not to mention the sunscreen! ohhh the sunscreen!!!
"ZIKA presents as a very mild flue like disease, it is already all over Puerto Rico , no one is going to the Doctor, health insurance is not paying for testing. It will be impossible to trace IMHO. One confirmed case means dozens , maybe hundreds, if it is in PR it is in the VI.A warning has been issued, so your airline should give you a refund or a rain check with a doctors note."
I want to report back on my decision. Thanks to everyone who have provided information and recommendations regarding my situation. I am super grateful to all TA friends. I ended up deciding to cancel my trip because CDC has added USVI into the warning list.I called up United and my resort company today and they were both kind enough to allow me cancel with no penalty. I am still disappointed since I have been looking forward to visit USVI for a long time. But not taking any chances with my baby is the priority right now. I will certainly look for another opportunity to come visit sometime!
Sheena thanks for updating your thread. It must be a big disappointment but you have so much to look forward to including that family trip to St. John which is a wonderful place to bring children.
"CDC does not recommend travel to this area. However, these fact sheets may be helpful in preventing the Zika virus.cdc.gov/zika/pregnancy/question-answers.html"
shenna_13 you absolutely made the right decision -- there will always be time for the USVI....
i would add that as an epidemiologist who is watching this epidemic curve (what we KNOW of it) grow rapidly -- fooling around with this if you are pregnant is just ridiculous --
"I am so sorry Shenna, but agree you made the right decision; every day the news appears to be getting worse! Good on United and the resort company for understanding. (And thanks for letting us know, have been thinking about you!)"
