"Two major Canadian travel insurance providers — Manulife and TuGo — will no longer reimburse new customers who need to cancel their trips due to the coronavirus outbreak. This applies to new policies, not to existing ones.https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/coronavirus…"
If they purchased it after March 5 or later. Anything purchased on Mar. 4 or before is still covered.
"That seems reasonable. It's not exactly an unknown risk anymore, for anyone who is just booking a trip now, that any travel destination could become affected.I booked two more trips last week. I have my own cancellation insurance by way of not really investing any non-refundable cash. I never prepay hotels or rental cars, so there's nothing to lose there. For my flights, it seemed like an opportune time to redeem frequent flier miles, so I can just get my miles back for a $30 fee if I need to cancel later."
"FYI, Manulife has just extended it to if you buy today you are still covered as they didn't give enough notice for the Mar. 5th deadline."
