I see that there are two Grand Palladiums. Does the Grand Palladium Jamaica NOT have a beach? I am looking to book and the price is favorable for this resort but if I'm going to the beach ..... I would like to stay on the beach:) Thanks.
"If you want a great beach, you need to go to Negril."
"GP has a piece of beach, but it's small, manmade, and kind of rocky. it's not the long stretch of beach one sees in the adverts for the Caribbean. Negril is the place for that -"

"We have been to the Palladium twice. There are two resorts combined; the Jamaica side and the Lady Hamilton. Guests from either side use all the same amenities. The best beach at the Palladium is Sunset Cove, easy to snorkel right off the beach and great jerk chicken hut at lunch time!There are two other beaches, as nevsgal says, one is small and rocky; the other beach was a topless beach so I have never been to it and can't really offer advice on it.The rooms on the Jamaica side of the resort are jr. suites. We found them comfortable.We were going to head back there again this year but found a better deal at the Jewel Runaway Bay.Edited: 7 years ago "
"I don't have a review on this property, however have a question regarding something a client of mine was inquiring about. Apparently she heard that there is an epidemic of stray cats on the beach and they tend to walk through the resort. Has anyone who has recently visited the Grand Palladium have any feedback regarding the stray cat??"
"thecruisemom,will you please stop worrying people unnecessarily about a so called 'epidemic' of stray cats. This is at least the third time you have asked this question on different threads.THERE IS NO EPIDEMIC OF STRAY CATS AT THE GRAND PALLADIUM HOTELS!"
"WOW Rowz, that was rather RUDE! The poster can ask the same question in different threads a million times if she so desires. Is it annoying to some? Maybe......if so there is no need for them to respond.Maybe some people do not like cats and just the appearance of 5 cats can be an ""epidemic"" to them. Different strokes for different folks.Personally I would rather see a cat then a RAT"
"I was at the resort in October and never saw 1 cat the entire time I was there.I was a bit worried about going to this resort because of post here on TA and the fact I love being on the beach. I ended up LOVING this resort and plan on returning again as soon as I can. Yes, the beaches are not the long white stretches of white sand but I found them very nice and each had their own qualities to them. The views and sunset from the resort are amazing. We found the staff to be very friendly."
"I have no intention of being rude, quite the contrary. However, this poster has been a member since 2008 and suddenly makes three posts on different threads about the same subject which could seriously damage the reputation of a hotel. Normally I wouldn't respond to such a post, but I have not long returned from the hotel and so feel very strongly that TA members are being worried unnecessesarily."
"I'm leaving in 3 weeks & am looking forward to it! Bit worried about the reviews. I was at RIU Negril in March & it was good. Thought we'd try a different resort this time. Hoping we're not disappointed. If you request certain rooms, do you do it prior to arrival?"
Actually she has beating that drum for months. Agenda?
Perhaps the concern about cats is the issue of hookworms they can put into the sand.
We were there last march. I don't remember seeing a cat at all. It was a very nice hotel and I would recommend it highly and go back in a second.
"Last Couple of flights to MBJ, the first thing you could see as the plane decended and made the left hand turn to Montego Bay was Grand Palladium. Yep, it was big !!!"
"I have been to the Grand Palladium 9 times and am returning again in 2 weeks. I have never seen more than one cat. Perhaps the person who thought that they saw the cats had too much to drink. The Grand Palladium is one of the nicest resorts that I have stayed at. Rooms are large, food is good, employees are friendly. There are always plenty of lounge chaiars available by the pool and ocean. The menu selections in the restaurants cater to even the fusiest eater. Don't hestitate to go there."
So are children allowed to use the beach on the Adult side (Lady Hamilton)? As well as the restuarants. If so how can they advertise it as an adults only? Just looking for a place since the old Breezes went to Jewel and allows children.
"The Lady Hamilton side is not completely adults only, and they don't claim it's adult only. There is an adults only pool and beach area (Coral Beach) on the Lady Hamilton side. There is also a section where they have the adults-only honeymoom suites. There are villas in between those areas where families do stay. The restaurants are not adults only, so you will encounter children during your stay at the Grand Palladium. That being said, the adults only pool/beach area is nice and segregated enough to provide an adults only environment. We have stayed there with and without our kids (fourth trip is coming up in June!). Hubby and I went a couple of years ago for our anniversary and stayed in the honeymoon suites with the outdoor shower. Very nice rooms with great views out on the point. We enjoyed the adults only environment at the beach and pool, it's pretty laid back and quiet over there. Most of the families seem to hang out at the main pool or the Sunset Beach where most of the activities/water sports happen."
"@ Lisa, thanks."
"We were just there last week and I only saw 2 cats the whole week, I had also read about 'all the cats'. 1 cat on the beach and 1 on the grounds, like another posted said I'd rather see a cat than a rat!I honestly was disappointed in the beaches at the resort, we spent 1 day at Coral beach, our friends enjoyed it but we choose the pool instead, but that is just our personal choice."
Palladium actually has several webcams on property that will give you a feel for the resort and the beach:www.palladiumaddict.net/jamaica-lucea/…
The beaches at the Grand Palladium are all man made. The shore along the point that the resort is on was bare rock before it was built.
"our visit to Gp, yes, there was cat's, some didn't bother me though, mostly down by the jerk hut. beaches, to be desired, very rocky, sea was extremly filled with seaweed, and I would not go in. except to snorkle which was awesome. property is amazing, and full of fun, and staff treated you like royality."
"The resort has three beaches: One called ""Breezes"", which is just close to the main pool and the Honey Moon Suite, another close to the adults pool at the GP Lady Hamilton and the one called ""Sunset beach"" where the jerk hut and the water sport center are located. The only man made beach is the first one. The other two ones are natural beaches."
having heard some people mention that drinks are only served in plastic cups is it reasonable to bring a thermal cup for day time use ?
yes yes yes.definitly take a n insulated cup
"We are going to the Palladium in Feb.2014 and I have a quick question about the adults only pool on the Hamilton side. Is there a pool bar near the adults only pool? If so is there a name for the bar? Thanks,John"
"Is there a pool bar near the adults only pool? Yes but it doesn't have a ""name"" that I know of."
is there much entertainment of a nightimewe are not looking for loud and brash etc..just the ability to do more than sit in a lobby bar for a few drinks on an eveningAm i right in thinking there is a show and then a band on at one of the bars at 9 every night?
"You are correct. There is a stage show in the theatre every night and then they have live music at the Infinity Bar around 9:00. These bands were generally very good, sometimes people would get up and dance. Then the disco opens at I believe 11:00."
thanks Susanwe like the look of the place but my wife doesn't want to spend two weeks of her hols sitting in a lobby bar.there also appears to be a beach party on a FRi night and a bonfire also. are they mossy and sand fly feeding stations ?
Will the bartenders really make a cocktail in your thermal cup? I guess I might feel a bit silly. LOL
