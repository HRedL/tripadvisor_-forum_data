"Hi there, we're taking a family vacation to Guangzhou, China. Should I be worry about the outbreak from Wuhan? Do I need to setup WeChat payment for easier purchase transactions? Thank you in advance for all the advice."
"At this point, no need to worry about Wuhan outbreak if you'll be in Guangzhou. WeChat payment not easily available to foreigners without Chinese bank accounts. Not worth the trouble of trying to set up for short visit. Use cash RMB instead."
"Wuhan virus is Real and a fast developing story with news daily, with conflicting reports and wide spread suspected official coverups. I tend to believe the UK estimate of 1700 cases than China’ low ball number, even the Chinese people don’t believe it. Latest news is it has been found in 2-3 other Chinese major cities, as well as Tokyo, Bangkok etc. It is now US national news, on all major network national news. Follow it to decide yourself.We canceled a March 2020 China tour, Wuhan to Chungching, also cancelled annual April business visit to Guangzhou. I see zero reason to take this unnecessary risk. Chances are I will not get sick, but if I go, I’d be very worried everyday everywhere, need to avoid crowd and minimize people, be selective in food. I wouldn’t touch any elevator buttons, no door handle, I wouldn’t touch anything in the public, I’d wipe everything before I touch it. Elevator button was how SARS started. If I catch a cold which is not uncommon, I’d seriously worry if this is Wuhan virus. If I have a fever coming home, I maybe taken away for Quarantine."
From what I’ve read Wuhan is where i would avoid. Those other cases in Japan and Thailand had been in Wuhan as well. They also haven’t proved a person to person transmission. I chose to take my trip - had not planned to go near there anyway.
"Just looked at the latest updates, and I'm going to amend my answer in #1 above. This illness is spreading (or either they are looking more diligently for cases) and it's almost certain there's person-to-person transmission starting to happen. It has now been reported in Guangdong province, imported from Wuhan. If yours is not an essential visit (and ""family vacation"" doesn't sound too essential), then I would change plans particularly if kids are involved. Go somewhere else, or postpone for at least a couple of months or so until there's more information and more of a handle on this situation. I don't think the risk is high, but it's not zero either. The upcoming Chinese New Year travel season, particularly inside China, has the potential to have this outbreak go widespread.Edited: 12:09 am, January 20, 2020 "
"As reported on CBS and ABC national news, as well as US local news, total cases now stand at 201, increase of 136 new cases in one day. Reminded me of daily news updates during SARS. Virus outbreak made headline news in the US on all channels. Don’t touch anything in the public, no elevator buttons, no bathroom door or toilet handles, no staircase railing. Wear mask. Avoid crowd. Don’t catch cold, you wouldn’t know if it is flu or this virus. Last place you want to go to is a hospital."
"First case found in Korea few hours ago, in addition to Japan, Thailand, Beijing, Shenzhen. 5 new cases reported in Zhejiang by one media but not yet reconfirmed by other media."
Thank you for all the advice. I will look into more about it and try not stay there too long since we are there for the Chinese New Year.
"BBC reported 14 medical staff contracted the virus from one carrier. Confirmed by SCMP. “The key to controlling the spread of the disease now is about preventing the emergence of a super-spreader [of the virus],” Zhong said, referring to infected patients who quickly help spread the virus, especially among medical workers.He said that a number of the cases in Guangdong involved patients who had not travelled to Wuhan."
"With the confirmation of virus among 14 medical workers and among patients in Guangdong who have never been to Wuhan, the crisis reached a different level. These new things didn’t happen within the last 8 hours, they have been going on for days and weeks, except they can no longer control and censor the news as situation escalates. Which leads to the next question, what else are they not telling? I am monitoring it closely because it effects our business operation, we canceled business visits. We need this thing to go away fast, unfortunately this can’t go away fast."
"at the end of the day your choice at least now...if it gets really bad I assume some government warnings will be put out... but the comment ""try not stay there too long since we are there for the Chinese New Year."" makes me wonder if you realize how fast this is spreading and a large gathering is one of the first things to avoid."
"If this escalates quickly in the next 3 weeks (likely with all the travel for Chinese New Year), then it's likely some sort of warning will be declared and if it goes like it did with SARS, airlines will offer scheduled passengers the ability to cancel or at least change their tickets to future travel.What most people don't understand is that risk of getting the illness is just part of the equation. If this new virus becomes a quarantinable disease (at this point, I'd give it 50/50 within a month's time), then you will be prevented from traveling if you show any symptoms (which could end up being just a cold or regular flu), or if you are in a group that may be well but have come in contact with someone who contracted this virus. During SARS in Beijing, this is why a lot of nonessential expats with kids left the country as soon as the government announced the problem--because they didn't want to risk being prevented from leaving the country or worse, having themselves or their kids put in a Chinese quarantine hospital. Once subject to quarantine, you cannot fly out and you cannot be medevac'd out to another country even if ill. You will be at the mercy of the Chinese health care system. Something to think about."
Very good point kvchinaa. Thank you for your insight. You have brought up some things I had not thought about.
National Institutes of Health (NIH) Confirms 14 medical personnel were infected in Wuhan as well as other news as reported. This raised the level substantially. One more death is reported. Etc etc..
"This reminded me during SARS, authorities in several countries closed off quarantined hospitals, without advance notice, no one was allowed to leave or enter, workers, patients and families. I think some attempted to escape. That was considered as sentenced to death, in fact, many inside died. Extreme measures were required."
"Some frontline news, at this point in time it is not an issue or real concern in e.g. Shanghai yet. Though I agree that this might change once people return after the Chinese New Year.PS: Looking forward to dinner and a visit to a, usually pretty crowded, Jazz Bar tonight."
"generally how soon would this get under control, i am not sure how long the SARS virus lasted. I have already booked my tickets for July and now getting worried."
"SARS was first detected in Guangdong Province in November of 2002, but it was kept quiet. As part of the foreign community in Beijing who had access to in-country and non-Chinese sources that the general Chinese population did not, we foreigners were aware by February 2003 that some strange flu-like respiratory illness was going on in south China. By mid-March, it was popping up outside China but the Chinese government was still in public denial that much of anything was wrong. At the beginning of April when the Finnish ILO officer came to Beijing on a plane from Bangkok and died a few days later, everybody in the foreign community in Beijing knew, and many of the Chinese were starting to understand this was really bad, also. I will never forget Easter Sunday, April 20, 2003. The Chinese government finally announced that SARS was a serious problem, they ordered closure of all public venues except retail stores, grocery stores, and restaurants (though nobody much was shopping or eating out)--conferences, sports and cultural events and performances, bars, churches, health clubs, etc. Schools were closed and went to distance/electronic learning. Universities were partially closed and many under quarantine. No inside construction/interior work could be done. The May holiday (a week long fest back then) was essentially cancelled for travel--Chinese citizens were not allowed to leave China without government permission, though foreigners who weren't sick could still leave. Flights into much of China and Hong Kong were cancelled or cut back severely. In early May I flew from Beijing to Bangkok on a Thai Airways widebody that had only a couple of dozen of us (mostly fleeing Thai university students) in the entire aircraft. The government started getting things under control by June, and by late June things were getting sort of back to normal, and I think SARS emergency was declared over in July. So #17, you might be OK. I'd sit tight until spring.Edited: 1:13 pm, January 21, 2020 "
new case now in USA...Washington state...had been in Wuhan.
"First US case of Wuhan coronavirus reported in Washington State, New York Times and CNN report.A British tourist is feared to have contracted the mysterious coronavirus that’s sweeping Asia after he was hospitalized on a trip to Thailand, according to a report.Taiwan reported first case. Total cases increased to 300. 6 death. Authorities in China ordered no fee full refund for Wuhan flights and trains. Calling on Wuhan residents not to leave the area, requesting outsiders not to go to Wuhan. Cathay Pacific flight attendants are fighting for the right to wear face masks on all flights as the Wuhan coronavirus spreads, with their union warning against the “catastrophic” effects of waiting until a staff member fell ill."
"We leave at the end of March for a 5 week trip through China and will definitely be paying close attention to the situation. Thank you for the updates. kvchinaa, your post (#12) is especially sobering and has made me see that there might come a point when we will need to consider canceling our trip if the virus does continue to spread."
China confirms 9 dead from coronavirus and 440 infected.
"The Chinese province of Hubei has confirmed 17 deaths and more than 444 total cases of the coronavirus, which emerged in the capital of Wuhan, state TV reported around 8 p.m. local time Wednesday."
"I think people can ask for advice on a travel forum, but they have to understand that they won't be given any guarantees and must make their own decision based on urgency of the need to travel, health of the travel party, exact place in China one is going, etc. We can't account for all the variables and don't pretend to.Even the Chinese and international medical authorities cannot yet prognosticate and know what is going to happen. Based on what we know as of January 22, my own advice would be for anybody planning to visit anywhere in China in the next 6-8 weeks, to cancel or postpone until the situation becomes clearer. Chinese New Year travel could spread this illness all over the place, not to mention the normal assortment of colds and influenzas. Except for absolute emergency reasons to come to China, a visit probably isn't worth the risk right now. For those with trips further out, wait and see before making a decision. For those with trips in midsummer and beyond, rest easy for now, as this all likely will get controlled and go away, just like with SARS."
"I have a pretty high personal worry threshold for these various medical scares. The media, in China as elsewhere, enjoys its ""disease du jour."" On the other hand, this one does seem to be spreading rather rapidly and I view the busy Spring Festival travel season 春运 as a huge multiplier. I could not imagine a better way to ensure that whatever a few people have will quickly infect the many than to put them all together, shoulder to shoulder, in packed railway stations and airports. I had a New Year's trip planned myself for Friday. Was going (from Kunming) to Jianshui by train for a few days. Was looking forward to it, reservations all made and prepaid. Now I'm having second thoughts and might cancel at the last minute. Bold resolve is one thing; but being foolhardy is different.Edited: 3:47 pm, January 22, 2020 "
"Deaths from China’s new virus rose to 17 on Wednesday with more than 540 cases confirmed, increasing fears of contagion from an infection suspected to originate from illegally-traded wildlife. Was 444 cases only few hours ago."
"The Chinese government has quarantined the city of Wuhan and plans to shut down the airport and public transportation within hours amid an outbreak of the coronavirus, state media reported. Anyone traveling runs the risk of this happening in any other cities where the numbers if people affected is high."
Shenzhen has introduced temperature checks before entering the metro.
"All public transport in and out of the Chinese city of Wuhan, including trains, buses and ferries, stopped at 10am on Thursday as the central government imposed a quarantine to try to contain the spread of a coronavirus that has killed 17 people and infected hundreds more.Local residents had rushed to railway stations and the airport after the announcement of the lockdown on Wednesday night. The government told residents not to leave the city without “special reasons”.Just saw ABC tv footage of a hospital in Wuhan, fever clinic is jam packed, 540 cases maybe is an underestimation."
"According to a first person account by an infected medical professional, who visited Wuhan hospital and returned to Beijing, he got the virus through his eyes. He was wearing protective clothing and mask, but was not wearing protective eye gear. For those of you still going to China, bring mask and goggles."
Im super scared too. Im leaving on the 30th of this month. Idk what to do.
Anyone planning on New Years events should probably be checking...was reading that in many larger cities events are being cancelled as you read this. The situation is not good and large gatherings of people will make it worse.
"Our trip isn't till the end of March but my husband is already starting to say that we might not go. I'm going to watch carefully over the next 3-4 weeks, and hope it becomes contained."
"Yea Mac @ #31, and you forgot to mention to drink plenty of water. Because that is also spread as a fact on the very same local Chinese social media channels!And what exactly is your first person account? A relative, a business associate, an employee or someone you heard about who heard about?Yes the situation is getting more and more serious, but as of now there is no confirmed source nor a detailed confirmation how it spreads. Again yes, human to human transmission looks practically certain, but that is about as much as is certain right now.As for source there are Chinese social media claims that it came from bats that where eaten raw, to cat sized bamboo rats, to several other animals.But I can confirm that the general public in China is now getting extremely concerned and this is even the overriding topic a Chinese New Year's dinners."
"Scary indeed, and pleased that I did not book an Asia trip that I had planned. Just travelling on aircraft and congregating at airports making connections in that region must now be high risk, and I have heard that people can be contagious even without showing any symptoms."
"Well, we just arrived to China. Layover at Japan, one bad experience was when I getting my boarding pass at Portland airport, the board pass for Japan to China didn't have any info on which gate. When we arrived Japan, there was no one outside the gate. One person in our group needs a wheel chair, and the airport staff took us a 10-15 minutes journey to a ticket counter got a boarding ticket then went back to the gate near by the one we just got off. One recommend to Japan airport is if they can have some airline staff right outside the terminal and able to check us in and reprint the boarding pass that would save us alot of walking."
Coincidence ????https://go.gale.com/ps/anonymous…
"Experts estimate it will peak by end of March, ends mud May. Which means it will get worse and worse to end of March. Another Beijing central government contagious disease doctor just returned to BJ, he handled bird flu, pig flu, SARS, etc. he was never scared before, he said he is really scared, it will be 10 times worse than SARS, quarantine of 3 cities is no use, it is out already. Hospitals are full, most patients are sent homes with no restriction or follow up. BBC checked nearby cities, one city has 89 cases, another 109 cases plus more death, none of these numbers are included in government reports. BBC also has videos inside hospitals, nurses and doctors are scared, they said they lie to their families everything is fine, but they said it is out of control, they are very scared. Another video showed freeways closed, no car is allowed to leave, reports of packed airport but no airline workers to check in, train stations packed as people trying to flee the city. The word used is Panic. If I were an expat with family or rich Chinese, I’d leave now, not later. All from reputable news networks, not online chats or rumors. All my previous posts turned out to be true. You can see, read and watch more from outside China, all public information if you follow the related news. These are only 1% of the reputable reports. You can search and read these subjects independently. Biggest problem and highest risk is anyone who thinks it is no big deal or encourage traveling in China. Personally I cancelled a March Tour in China and one April business visit, I follow it because it effect my business directly. Others can do whatever they want. Eventually it will go away, just like all previous contagious diseases, experts say mid May."
"#38. Yes, coincidence. I don't believe for a minute that this virus was something cooked up in Wuhan's new BSL-4 lab. If you've seen some of the wet markets of central and southern China, you'd be pretty convinced that this was something (like SARS) that jumped from animal to human.That said, I don't think @Mac is doing anybody any favors with his over-the-top commentary. One can be levelheaded about this, without inciting panic nor downplaying the risk. I'm already on record here as recommending that potential visitors to China, at least through end of March, reconsider nonessential travel, and those with travel a bit later in spring, watch and wait to make a final decision.Edited: 4:44 pm, January 23, 2020 "

"First the good news, Wuhan Coronavirus does not infect children, 2ndly, most patients recover in 7 days. There is some minority medical views that it is a flu, not SARS level disease, most do not agree with this. Serious cases and death are usually the weak and old. How do you know if it is a flu or Wuhan Coronavirus? one thing different than flu, Wuhan Coronavirus has no running nose."

"Fear of catching the virus aside, I’d be concerned about two things: the attractions I want to see being closed; and a sudden quarantine of an area I’m visiting, leaving me stuck there indefinitely. Just my thoughts.Edited: 10:03 am, January 25, 2020 "
"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/clone…Chinese government ordered travel agencies to suspend domestic and international tours from Monday, Jan 27 on. The same story has been reported here as a quote from Peoples' Daily."
We have a trip booked starting in Hong Kong March 4 and working our way up to Beijing by March 20. We don’t have anything planned in or near Wuhan. We are still on the fence because there are no new travel restrictions as of today. We are just watching and waiting. We also have a week booked in Japan so I don’t think we can get the money back for the flights there. Not yet anyway.
"Some of the latest news shows that this coronavirus has an incubation period of around 14 days. Worst, they found a child who was asymptomatic, but had the virus in his/her lungs. He/she was tested because of contact with a person who has the coronavirus. The only thing we really know about this disease is that it is contagious, it is air-bourne, it has a fairly long incubation period which means it probably cannot be contained. China will bear the brunt of this disease. So far, if you are elderly suffering from something else, you are probably at greatest risk. The death rate appears low, but we really don't know - I'm not even sure the Chinese Government knows. The only ones who really knows are those health workers in those clinics and hospitals in China. Furthermore, people in China only go to hospitals when they can't be treated at home - it is expensive for the average worker to be treated at a hospital. We are flying into Hong Kong Airport in 5 days. Fortunately, we are only in transit - because of the long layover - we bringing our N95 masks and surgical masks for our connecting flight. It is that long incubation period that scares us. Not afraid of catching the disease, but afraid of it ruining our long vacation that we have planned. All of this is my assessment of the situation so far."
"The Washington Post has an article today, ""Is it safe to travel to China"" which is a pretty good summary of current travel restrictions and refund or change policies through various airlines, hotels, etc. It also lists suggested items to take for travel and when to wear masks, etc.https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/tra…It's worth noting that a ""runny nose"" is still listed as a possible symptom, Therefore, take comments that symptoms do not include a runny nose (as stated in another person's post) with a grain of salt."
"@ #70 Ups, looks like I would have needed the ""Careful"" note :-(To be at least on topic as well, Shanghai is taking things apparently pretty serious. The pedestrian part of Nanjing Road has been closed (source: pictures on local social medias)."
"Well, I wondered if the Chinese government would suspend international outbound tours, and it apparently just has. This mirrors what they did in 2003, essentially cancelling discretionary pleasure travel for all its citizens just before the big May holiday week (it was a full week back then), as an attempt to minimize SARS transmission to other countries. But so far, there doesn't seem to be a prohibition on individual Chinese travelling on their own (in 2003, the order extended to all travelers even those not in groups). Spring Festival is a big time for Chinese to go traveling abroad, particularly after spending the obligatory first 3 days of the holiday with family. Non-sick foreigners are not prevented from leaving China, and that is likely to remain the case. But due to severely decreased demand for airline seats now, expect international flights to be curtailed (cancelled and remaining passengers consolidated onto fewer flights). Airlines cannot afford to fly empty aircraft at least not for very long. This is one of the logistical risks you run, if travelling to or through China anytime soon. You must build in some flex-time to allow for unexpected schedule changes. In 2003, I was allowed to leave Beijing for a preplanned holiday in Thailand. Once down there though, my return was delayed for several days, as Thai Airways had cancelled all but one flight a week to Beijing since practically nobody wanted to fly there.Edited: 12:33 pm, January 25, 2020 "

"South China Morning Post is a pretty good resource for current official numbers and reports - they are not directly censored - but as they are Chinese owned - you can expect them to not spread panic like Himalaya News or others with an agenda to make people afraid.According to SCMPThe Toll is now up to 2454 cases in Mainland China, and 80 Deaths. But seemingly only 533 from Wuhan - if that number is not based on the old 1950 cases ( and another 1000 expected alone in Wuhan):""Of the 2,700 people currently under observation in the city, about 1,000 were likely to be confirmed cases. As of Sunday, Wuhan had 533 confirmed cases.""So that means that the virus also outside of Hubei/Wuhan is reaching endemic levels. And that will mean much more travel bans and isolated cities - The NHC also announced:""The NHC also issued a nationwide plan on containing the epidemic by locking down certain neighbourhood communities in both urban and rural areas.In the case of a neighbourhood community or village having two confirmed cases, it could be declared an epidemic zone and sealed off, it said.....When asked if China planned to expand its travel ban to more cities, Li said the authorities would make adjustments as necessary"""
"Ah - the interesting thing about those 2700 cases. You can expect they all have fever - but if only 1000 have cNoV - it means the rest has normal influenza or maybe a very strong flu. So even in Wuhan, 7-10 days ago your chance of getting nCoV was lower than seasonal Influenza - and who knows if it is actually more dangerous/lethal. Just based on that however - I would not book any trip to China from now until End of February at least. Too many lock downs are likely. In 2-3 weeks I think the situation will be much clearer. It will be kinda visible if the isolation/quarantine of cities is helping at all or not, it will be known how lethal the cNoV is - and hopefully there will be petty exact estimations on the affected number of people/ R0 of cNoV.And I think it's clear - this outbreak will be much bigger than SARS in number of people that got it. If the number of people who die from it will be bigger, is not so sure."
"We are due to travel to China in May for the whole month.. all booked, including hotels. Spoke to the travel agent and we agreed that it is too early to panic and, worse case scenario, airline could/would/should refund or offer an alternative. Most of our hotels are cancellation free before April, so we need to make a decision by then. Sitting tight and sweating it on! Cant believe we have been planning this for 2 years!!"
"extremecarver,Believe that 2700 cases are confirmed cases. They do not have enough kits to test everyone. It is basically a triage system - only the worst cases gets tested and the rest go home until they get worst. You probably have to be in the pneumonic stage in order to get tested, and if it comes back positive, it still doesn't guarantee you a bed. I suspect the death rate will be climbing in China, not because the disease is not treatable, but treatment will not be available to everyone."
"As of the time of writing this, there are 4474 confirmed cases. You can get the latest Coronavirus information here:https:/…bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6"
"BREAKING: Death toll climbs to 106Confirmed cases in China soars to 4,515BloombergCBS just reported Wuhan Coronavirus has no running nose symptom."
"By now the hospital situation in Wuhan is pretty much back on track - So I would not believe the 2700 cases are confirmed and only waiting for testkits/complications. I am sure they simply were all patients with fever that visited a hospital. But yes - yesterday there was a big surge in cases - so they were likely mostly out of that 2700 suspected people pool.Also the supermarkets are well stocked again. But yes - really everyone stays at home except for getting supplies - people are very scared.I have many friends in Wuhan - and they made a list of everyone to track down if someone is sick. Of 500 people in Wuhan - no one had fever, and only 4 a slight flu. 4 with Flu should be well in the average for this time of the season (actually even lower - but as everyone stays at home since 23.01 - hard to infect yourself with a flu).But most of them live in Wuchang and not in Hankou. Hankou so far was hit much worse.And Wuhan Coronavirus usually has running nose symptom - but not in every case! I do assume you can double the numbers of cases if not take them *5. And yes - outside Hubei only 1 death so far - so the danger of nCoV is lower than influenza according to most experts. The problem is - while you can still get a vaccination against this years Influenza - you cannot get that for nCoV for at least a couple more months. And yes - many deaths are certainly related to no/bad/late treatment. And yes - I also believe the R0 is much higher than seasonal Influenza. The main danger is rather that the virus mutates to be more dangerous - but that is not likely - as it would harm the spreading.Also CDC and other organisations are very sceptical about people not showing symptoms spreading the virus - they only see it possible with very close contact over 15 minutes...However - even if it's not so dangerous, I am sure the isolation of cities will still take weeks to be lifted (earliest mid February).I think South China Morning Post is the best source for news - they have the biggest coverage - and are not directly under Chinese press control."
"And consider you are in Wuhan right now and start coughing or start having a running nose. With the virus circulating it's clear you want to get tested. How many people of a city have a cold in winter once? I guess minimum 1 out of 2. Lets be generous and put winter period at 16 weeks. Even though 5 Million of people supposedly left Wuhan, likely 2 Million came in for holiday too, if not more. So 7 Mio / 16 weeks / 2 (1 out of 2 having a cold in the winter season) / 7 (days per week) . You now have 31 250 people each day going to hospital for nCoV checkup. Hospitals over new year are low on personal - only partly open. Many people working at the hospitals got afraid and stay at home (no kidding - I know quite a few cases, they just called in sick but in reality were just panicking/afraid and not going to work). So the hospital breakdown was bound to happen after the announcement. Especially in Hankou. It's over 30.000 people that usually would not visit a hospital every day wanting to get a complicated check. Everyone close (meaning 3-4km) to the seafood market without any symptoms likely also wanting to be checked up. China would have needed to first send lot's of staff for the hospitals - and only then quarantine Wuhan/Hubei. That way the chaos would have been much lower - and less panic, The R0 most likely right now are around 2.5 - with average 7 day incubation period. Up to one week ago nothing was done except disinfecting some places (and a few informed people left already - but no warnings out meant very few would worry) - then the isolation and everyone started to panic. And yes - before 20. January certainly the local government was covering up and issued wrong number. The current surge of cases is to be expected - because before nothing was done and then they got overwhelmed. Right now we definitely do not have a doubling in cases per day - just much more people being tested (and regarding deaths - the reports that many death certificates before isolation happened - with wrong reasons in order to cover up problems - are likely true. So no wonder about the sharp rise)."

"""So I would not believe the 2700 cases are confirmed and only waiting for testkits/complications."" The official numbers out of China are over 4500 cases confirmed at this point and many experts are suggesting its way more than that. Its also misleading to suggest the CDC is very skeptical about the Chinese claims that people can transmit the disease before showing symptoms. The CDC simply said they haven't seen any clear evidence of that but they admitted they may not have seen all the data from China and that they won't know more until he incubation period of the US cases are over which is anywhere from 1 day to 14 days. Bottom line is they still don't know fully what they are dealing with"
"I have a feeling these folks are simply ignorant of facts and news. Obviously they don’t read news or can’t count. We have these naive Europeans thinking this is a flu, bullying any messengers of inconvenient truth. Those European expats in China can’t get the news or Facebook, some even boycott WeChat and Facebook. Of course it is transmitted between people, how else can 4500 people get it? From 4500 bats? Unbelievable. The World Health Organization evaluated the risk of #WuhanPneumonia as “very risk in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level"" and admitted it had incorrectly claimed the risk as “moderate” in previous report. Wait until you see the numbers tomorrow and next week."
"Golly Gosh Mac, you're right - I don't see FaceBook and my WeChat friends just post pics of their dinners or kids. My news is limited to sites like the BBC or CNN and papers like The Guardian or Washington Post. I'm sure if I had FaceBook I'd know as much as you.BTW - On one of these threads you talked about the second Japan case while not mentioning that he was a tour bus driver taking a bunch of Wuhan people around. Just a typo?"
"Of course there is human to human transmission. But transmission before symptoms are appearing - stay unlikely. Some experts believe this did not happen - because they cannot trace every contact. Other experts say it's very unlikely but can/will happen with very close contact over 15 minute (so you can get if from your husband/wife/living partner you share a bed with before symptoms appear - but not from someone walking past on a street or sitting besides you in the same room). Once symptoms are there - transmission is a big threat. Mac you should start reading correctly what I wrote.And there are now many hospitals in Wuhan without queues. But yes of course - due to all the backlog the numbers of cases found are bound to greatly increase in Wuhan over the next 2-3 days - much greater than the R0 of ~2.5 should let you expect.2700 was yesterdays number of suspected patients in Wuhan - of whom 1000 were announced to be expected to be infected. Considering it takes 24 hours to confirm - the increase from 2800 to 45xx in China from Yesterday to Today is right in line with expectations! And yes - of course many more cases will be found in Wuhan - there is a huge backlog due to chaotic situations at the hospitals the last 5-6 days plus the city govt making mistakes.Also many experts claim that the first transmission from animal to humans most likely happend any time in October already. So those cases discovered in December were not actually the first. This number could be too low by a big factor already. Especially as someone just having a ""flu"" in December would directly be dismissed.Edited: 7:48 am, January 28, 2020 "
"Oh yeah - and as it first appeared in Jianghan- a pretty rich district of Wuhan. The market is directly bordering (not inside) the nightlife/business/luxury shopping areas of Jianghan/Hanyang. So if any virus breaks out there - it will likely affect many of the upper middle class - who travel a lot.The virus did not had the first human infected in December - but much earlier. Some sources say November, some October. see e.g: https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/wuha…or virological.org/t/…347"
"Assuming you guys have some idea of what you are talking about, at what point in that sequence should China have hit the panic button? It seems generally agreed that they should have done it earlier, but tied to which development?"

I would say in your excited fashion you come off as a little ""hysterical"" which turns people off. Best to present the facts (documented if possible), the steps of your logical conclusion, then you can be a little excited at the end. Most of the readers on this forum will not have the same data that you have. I am more upset at extremecarver who seems to be downplaying too many things. In February, the sh*t will really hit the fan when people start returning from the Lunar New Year holidays."
@MacLike YOUR facts that small children are immune?
How about you bring some news to this table? Show us what you know. Except one liners to attack messengers. I have not seen one bit of news from you.
Not sure where you’re travelling from but the UK FCO have advised against all non essential travel to Mainland China not including Hong Kong or Macau.

"The number of confirmed cases of the rapidly spreading coronavirus infection in mainland China has reached 5,496, health authorities said on Wednesday, a total that surpasses that of Sars, the epidemic in 2003 that killed more than 600 people worldwide.The death toll has climbed to 131, they announced, with 840 newly confirmed cases in Hubei province.Sars infected 5,327 people in mainland China in nine months and killed 349 people, according to the World Health Organisation (WTO).The total deaths from the new coronavirus infection are all reported in mainland China, with 125 in Hubei province, where the outbreak began, and six in other provinces. About 3,300 people are hospitalised in Hubei province, with more than 20,000 being observed for infection."
"An expert from the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC) said it could take 10 more days for the outbreak to peakAustralian scientists have replicated the virus in a lab in what the BBC term a ""significant breakthrough""(Source: BBC website)"

British Airways has stopped all direct flights to and from mainland China because of the coronavirus outbreak.
"No only BA, Lufthansa, Swiss and AUA too. But mainly because flights are empty. However today also for BA planes still departed for China, and will return on schedule. But no future flights until 9. Feb (that's the date for Lufthansa at least). Booking of flights was blocked for all of February - so you can expect much more flights to be cancelled (they will have to fly a couple of times to bring people back however - or book them to partner airlines - except if other airports are fully shut down).I guess you can still go - just make sure that if you get back 7-10 days later than planned - because you need to wait for an evacuation flight - is possible.IMHO it all depends on the future numbers. The isolation will only be kept up - IF in 7-10 days the infections really go down. If however the cases keep on rising - but with proper treatment very few people will die (so far only 1 person has died outside of Hubei from cNoV) - then maybe other regulations will start - but quarantine/isolation will consider to have failed and cost too much money to keep up. It looks like outside of Hubei - meaning early enough treatment just as with any other influenza - the cases are not dangerous. Maybe on average even less severe than influenza, more like a flu. Then other tacticts will be employed and travel can start again...The death cases in Wuhan are heavily overstated - because they panicked and they did mistakes, and many people did not get any treatment. Right now this is getting under control - and I bet the death rate will soon drop below 1%"
"The Lufthansa Group, British Airways, and Indonesia’s Lion Air Group have cancelled all flights to the mainland, while the likes of United Airlines, American Airlines, Air Canada, IndiGo, Finnair, and Jetstar Asia have drastically reduced their services.American announced it would cancel its Los Angeles flights to Beijing and Shanghai from February 9 until March 27, citing a sharp drop in demand. Its existing flights to China from Dallas would continue as would services to Hong Kong.Lufthansa, which includes its sister airlines Swiss International Air Lines, and Austrian, and accounts for more than 100 return flights a week, said it would halt all China flights until February 9.BA, which operates daily services to Beijing and Shanghai, said the cancellations were in effect until January 31, although its website appears to show they are not taking any bookings for direct flights to the mainland until March 1.Hong Kong ordered all airlines to cut flights to and from the mainland by half on Tuesday.More foreign governments have recommended all but essential travel to China, prompting some airlines to act, while others admitted the spread of the virus had seen passengers reschedule or cancel travel, leading to near empty planes flying in and out of the mainland."
"I want to thank all of the regular posters who have shared updates and kept the reading audience very well informed. I am scheduled for a trip to China this summer, which I may end up canceling anyway, but I surely feel for all of those who were set to travel soon and have been trying to respond to all the many developments. Sometimes a few writers walk the line in being courteous, but overall this forum has been a fantastic resource and again, I thank you for your commitment to communicating with your Tripadvisor colleagues!"
""". I am scheduled for a trip to China this summer"" - summer is quite far away so things may very well be under control by then. I would wait a few months before making decisions."
"The number of known coronavirus cases jumped by 1,737 to to 7,771 in China on Thursday morning including the first confirmed case in Tibet, according to health authorities, raising the global total to almost 8,000 – and nearing the total infections worldwide in the Sars outbreak of 2002-03.The epidemic’s death toll also continued to rise sharply, by 38 since Wednesday, taking the total to 170 – all in China – as of Thursday morning. The coronavirus is believed to have originated last month in a market that sold wild animals in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in central China."

If you are young and healthy and get infected - most likely it will be over just like a normal flu/cold.
"""If you are young and healthy and get infected - most likely it will be over just like a normal flu/cold."" Some young otherwise people have died from this. By the way WHO just declared a global health emergency. This is not like a normal cold/flu no matter how many times you try to claim that."
@Mac - while you mostly post correct sources/infos (not in the beginning) - I do think you are trying to create panic. You do post about the cruise ship being held up - but actually by the time you posted the news about the negative test out for a couple of hours - but you don't mention it!If you want to inform properly - then mention negative cases too - or stop mentioning suspicious cases.
"Also from normal influenza/flu some young people are dying. Especially in countries without good health systems! Wuhan right now cannot be considered to have a normal level of health care.Also note that outside of Hubei/Wuhan so far there was only 1 death (as of 2 days ago at least). So far I'm not sure if there have been new death cases in China but outside Hubei.And yes - it's not like a normal cold/flu - because we don't have any kind of heard immunity (no prior immunity, no vaccine). That is the main difference. That's why I write maybe 3-4 Mio people will die from it in 2020 (so 6-8 times as many as from normal flu/influenza).If it keeps sticking around - by 2022 it will be just like a normal flu!Edited: 3:27 pm, January 30, 2020 "

"What happen now for Americans still in China? They can still come home, but 14 days quarantine? What airlines? Can Chinese carriers fly into US? For how long before they are suspended too? Transit through Japan or Korea or Taiwan or HK? When will these doors are closed? I am sure there are many Americans in China still think it is perfectly okay to stay in China. Buy for how long? What if they change their minds 2 weeks later? We all judge crisis differently, historically there are always some people got left behind."
"@Mac, Do not presume to judge all other Americans who may be in China. Your yardstick is not the exclusive one by which all lives are measured. Many Americans work in China, or have Chinese families, and cannot easily leave without literally tossing their career/life away. Sometimes it makes less sense to cut and run. If one is set up to last out a city-level quarantine, it can all work out. If you have a life in China, a good place to stay, source of food, and a complete support system there, it is not necessarily a disaster to stay. This will probably not make sense to people whose contact with China has been limited to tourist and business visits and who haven't truly LIVED in the country long-term. But having made the decision to stay in China during SARS, I can speak personally to the issue. Foreigners who stuck around didn't beg our governments to come get us, not at the outset, not in the middle of the outbreak, and not towards the end. But the above is about RESIDENTS. This forum thread really pertains to VISITORS who are in a different situation from residents and should parse their decision-making differently as well. Visitors have their main life elsewhere, and can more easily make the decision to not go to China, or to cut an existing visit short and leave. However, that window of opportunity to leave is shrinking by the day due to border closures and flight curtailments."
"Wanted to add: at this time, I don't think there are all that many short-term Americans left in China right now. Most business activity shut down for the holiday, and most individual tourists and group tourists that were in the country since 1/23 have left. And those that had plans to arrive in the next month, have cancelled out. Most of the people there are either hard-core stayers, for various personal reasons, or are key managers trying to hold a business together until the situation improves."
"I remember that Singapore woman asking if her parents should move up Feb 9th departure to NY, that was several days ago. My answer was, leave now before doors are closed. The door is closed now, not 100% yet, but within days or hours. On yesterday’s NYC flight, we used Clorox disinfecting wipes, to go pack. Wiped down trays, armrests, screens, they are touch screens, 3 movies, I must’ve touched that screen 50 times. Also TV remote control in hotel room.Paranoid? So what?Coming back to my hotel room in NYC just now, I used handkerchief to push floor button. If you are old enough to remember SARS and infamous No.9 floor button at Metropolis hotel in HK, where SARS started in HK, 7 people on 9th floor died.I politely declined several handshakes today from business counterparts in NYC.I am not worried about Coronavirus, I don’t want to catch a flu."
"Australia to shut border to foreign nationals arriving from China to fight spread of coroavirusThe country also discouraged Australians from visiting China at all, raising the travel alert to the maximumThe move comes a day after Singapore and the US restricted its borders to people who have recently travelled through mainland China."
However I'm pretty sure that everyone who just waited for free change by airline - got it for free. Because of travel restrictions for Chinese groups already before - many planes had lots of space...There was no need for anyone to pay for an earlier flight with February departure from China...
"Japan added 3 new cases, total 20, most among all foreign countries. Some new cases are alarming in details, all 3 were in Japan’s 3 evacuation flights. First man was healthy and no sign of virus when checked upon entry, he was cleared; he then developed symptoms and tested positive in Japan. That means temperature and other meanings of checking passengers are useless. Unfortunately other doors are closing, Italy and Vietnam ban all flights from HK, Taiwan and China, not just China. Unfortunately Coronavirus turned out to be far worse than my worst estimate, I was saying this will be 10 times worse, I was wrong, it is far worse. What Trump couldn’t accomplish in 2 years of trade war, what he couldn’t imagine to do all has been accomplished in 1 month. In hind sight, 2 years of trade war was minuscule in comparison to Coronavirus. The wide range of social and economic disruptions and setbacks are enormous and devastating. It surpassed SARS, and this is only the first month, the beginning.Edited: 11:35 am, February 01, 2020 "
Just saw on CNN drones flying around in China tell people to put on masks...why would they at this point not be wearing a mask? Also each day there are credible and substantiated reports from officials outside of China that numbers are being suppressed which I guess we all knew. Mac's reference to the economic and social impacts of this will be massive and only just begun. In effect within a few days China will be quarantined from the rest of the world with borders and flights stopped. At this point I must imagine that for any non nationals wanting to get out in the days before flights stop they will be paying extortionate prices.
"Stick market tanked on Friday, that is minor compare to what’s to come. We will not have incoming shipment from China for 2-3 months minimum or longer, our shipments from other countries depend on parts and materials from China. Not just us, it will effect all. What Trump couldn’t dream of happened in one month, not just reduction of trade, also total ban on travel and all Chinese to enter US. Iit has been only one day, I need time to figure it out. What the most powerful man and country couldn’t do was accomplished by a tiny tiny virus."
Mac as usual you make good solid experience based comments...appreciate that. Delta has now moved up the termination of flights to last flight to china today feb. 1 and last flight back to states feb. 2...previously it was Feb. 6. I have to think they know more than we do about the situation. Quarantining these people will be very costly....
"Yesterday we received another big order from a US nation chain stores, for products to be released in Japan in April, May and June. I was not able to calculate delivery time, our Tokyo people couldn’t, nobody knows. April, May, June, entire 2nd quarter, 1/4 of a year. If Apple stock drops, I’ll buy more and more."
"On the German evacuation flight at least 4 people from 130 got symptoms of slight coughing or stomach problems on the flight (just spoke 10 minutes on the phone with a friend who got evacuated on that flight) Possibly more. However the German evacuation was a disaster anyhow - as I reported in another thread. 11 hours of waiting at the airport before they could start checking in. So lots of stress, basically no food besides instant noodles - and anxiousness. So no wonder - Germany properly fu**ed up the evacuation. Then the flight had to be rerouted. Now people are just finished in the medical checks - Most have left their homes about 35 hours ago - now first time they can sleep (but not knowing when they will be transported onwards to the quarantine location - everyone stuck in sports hall - with military field beds 50cm from each other). So most people have not slept at all for over 40 hours. So the immune system is properly destroyed by the disastrous German organisation.Some people were lucky and being afraid of the crowded airport returned home - and waited for a phone call from other evacuees about the check-in opening - and came again to the airport. It's crazy that the German embassy is so badly managed."

One way is to go the panic stricken, mindless rumour and ridiculous speculation way and complain about things we have no power or knowledge of creating unnecessary fear among others.Another way is to look at it in less panic stricken way, as logical as possible given the practical limitations, realities and best available health science, technology, resources, emergency response and planning we have within our imperfect countries, governments, health systems, human failings and societies with more dignity than the other way mentioned above.If we take last mentioned approach we should have a much better chance of getting through this. However, it’s very likely we will handle this with a combination of the two ways above as a certain level of panic is needed to motivate into action with both successes and mistakes along the way."

The typical websites that are not able to research facts and love to spread fake news - e.g.g https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/more-… report a lockdown of Guangzhou - however once again that is fake news. There are a couple of residential blocks that got quarantined - but mainly they introduced mandatory temperature checks when you exit your residential block - so not quarantine at all:…xinhuanet.com/gd/2020-02/07/c_1125542462.htm
"From The Japan Times:“ Fears of an epidemic on board a cruise ship off Yokohama came to a head Friday as the health ministry reported 41 more coronavirus infections, bringing the total to 61 so far.”I believe this is from the one guy who disembarked in Hong Kong and was showing no symptoms on the cruise and just 4 days into the quarantine on that cruise.” Be sure to carry lots of hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes if you go anywhere.Edited: 3:39 pm, February 07, 2020 "
There are more and more rumours about patients that showed symptoms - but got tested negative - then sometimes later got tested positive. It seems in China now the only way to be considered negative is by BOTH by (RT)-PCR test and CT. That would further complicate things.I cannot find the source anymore - but German scientists estimate that coronavirus can survive 4-9 days on cold metal surfaces (e.g. doorknob outside the house) - best condition for the virus to survive is cold and damp.
Oh - wrong. Maybe not German scientists - here is the paper: https:/…That really does not look good. If the RT-PCR test rumours are true as well - I don't see any way a global pancemic can be stopped (vaccine won't be ready). Then the only hope is that effective medicine can be found PLUS even more important that people build antibodies - which so far is also not confirmed (I kinda understand - if people don't build antibodies - there also cannot be a vaccine - but maybe wrong here). So I tend to think the rumours about not anti-bodies building up - are wrong. Else Spanish flu might look like it was harmless.
"Saw some videos on Facebook, arresting anyone not wearing mask, cars tried to run the blockades to escape cities, over 70 major cities shut down with no entry or exit, 10000 of small villages with blockades, patient shacking violently uncontrollably once virus hits the nerve system, very gruesome illness and death, scary stuff. Not a flu. For 1000s of years, you shut down all borders and pull up the bridges. Pandemics have been around for 1000s of years. Shut down entry and exit for all. Still most effective way."
"Many of the videos on facebook and twitter are fake - and try to create panic. Just like those claiming Guangzhou got isolated. Or they show trucks spraying things - without telling it is pretty harmless disinfectant - because China knows that the virus can survive pretty long. So spraying disinfectant is not war but the best response.Then for example the video of the person being tracked down - many sources claiming he was supposed to be arrested because they expect him to have the coronavirus - very few sources telling the truth that the person attacked doctors with a knife before (yes he had reason to be angry, but attacking doctors with a knife is the worst solution).But yes - the locks on some houses are scary - and they seem to be true (local officers/authorities overreacting).There are now quite a few stories written by people who survived the virus in Chinese - most of them are not very scary. It's like a strong influenza. Yes that is scary - but if you get treated in a hospital you will most likely survive. It's mainly 5-7 days of bad bad time (no appetite, pain, coughing, sometimes coughing blood, surprisingly little fever - strong fever only a very few complicated cases) Spreading panic doesn't help. Starting to prepare - like creating plans on how we can also create huge ad-hoc hospitals on the other hand are what we should do. Closing borders can now only postpone the outbreak for a couple of weeks - then hope for spring.Remember the Spanish flu - those who got sick in the first wave - mainly survived. Those who got sick in the second wave hat very high fatality rates. I kind thing - the earlier you get ill, the better because you can still enjoy working hospitals...Now there are clear reasons (Word War) why the Spanish Flu second wave was so deadly. This won't happen again. It's just that IMHO Europe and USA cannot even cope that well as Wuhan does with the virus once it gets endemic.Edited: 5:28 pm, February 07, 2020 "
"Also many videos of teams going through neighborhoods with loudspeakers demanding residents to turn in Hubei citizens for rewards, reminiscent of Germans hunting Jews during WW2. New hospital turned out to be giant rooms with 100d or 1000 beds, all sharing one bathroom, no power, no medicine, not enough sanitary workers which always have the highest infection and death rate. Giant rooms housing contagious disease patients are incubators for more infections.They are not fake videos. Arrests are public and real. Death videos matched descriptions by major medias, all have been reported by CNBC BBC SCMP Bloomberg and described in details by talking heads on TV networks before. Things we already knew. Amazingly some people are still trying to downplay the Coronavirus and sugarcoating it as a flu."
"To suggest China shuts down the entire country of 1.4 billion people losing hundreds of billions in GDP, shaking up the stability and confidence of trust by its people and the world, because in their collective intelligence, they mistaken a flu as pandemic, it is to declare Chinese are stupid. Chinese are so stupid, they can’t tell the difference between a flu and pandemic, which even a common online nobody knows. These online nobodies are smarter than the entire Chinese government. Xi disappeared for 7 days, last time that happened was a failed coup. Xi showed up on TV yesterday with white hair, that never happened before with any Chinese leaders in history. People spot these signs, not just Chinese people, the world are watching every details. You can accuse Chinese people of anything you like, but they are anything but stupid.Edited: 7:03 pm, February 07, 2020 "
"Worldwide, there have been 720 deaths reported and more than 34,390 cases of infection."
"https:/… If this report is correct this current year normal flu rates in the north hemisphere, 15,000,000 in the US alone with 8200 deaths gives about 0.05% death rate or 1 in 2000 cases compared to Corona at 2.2% or 1 in 50 across all ages so it is about 44 times greater death rate to flu.Based on my last post above, when Corona death rates (80% of current 638 deaths) for infected people over 60 years age is considered the death rate appears to be 14% or 1 in 7 cases, 280 times that of this years US flu death rates. This is very significant in this age group. People in age group over 60 years have more underlying health issues such as 21-38% with heart disease etc. Therefore people in the over 60 years age group need to consider their much higher risk especially If they have those underlying health issues. The death rate for those under 60 years age is about 0.5% or 1 in 200 vs flu at 1 in 2000 cases so about 10 times greater death risk. If these figures are correct healthy people under age 60 years have much greater chances with Corona though ten times death rate risk to flu. These are just crude risk comparison figures to make sense of things and there are a lot of other issues and risk comparisons at play."
"Maybe attempts at statistical breakdowns should be left to the experts, especially when the underlying data may not be trustworthy and the fact that we are still in the early stages of this and the data is pretty much guaranteed to change over time."
Guangzhou shut down announced today.
"""Guangzhou shut down announced today."" - can't find anything about this"
"Seen on multiple TV news and talk shows in Taiwan. Multiple sources with detail list of restrictions. 11 million people, engine of production and center of commerce. We shall see. Shantou went into quarantine but official backtracked hours later. Hangzhou is in lockdown. These lock downs are not quarantine as in Hubei. I have many suppliers in Guangzhou, we maintain constant contacts, the entire city has been empty anyway, don’t know why the authorities need to shut down what has already been shut down. What do they know that we don’t know? I started to see many videos of authorities in varies cities aggressively confronting and arresting people out shopping, not wearing mask, playing MJ in homes, or arresting suspected infected persons, One video on South China Morning Post was a team of full hazmat suit agents busting Into a Jiangsu home to take away entire family by force into quarantine, they put up a tough fight. Another video on multiple major medias from different angles was about 10+ security people chasing down and arresting an infected man on the street. I have never seen such drastic and draconian forces anywhere ever in my lifetime; let alone shutting down the entire country of 1.4 billion. Chinese government is anything but stupid. Seems way excessive than what I read about Coronavirus, which suggest maybe there are far more scary things they are not telling us."
"All I see here is this:""GUANGDONG reported 16 new cases, raising the total number to 1,034 as of midday February 7. The province reported the first death, and a total of 74 people have been discharged from hospital. A total of 177 suspected cases were reported and 3,522 are under observation. Since the emergence of the pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus, Guangdong government has paid it the greatest attention and taken a series of prevention and control measures. On February 6, the province’s notice on compulsory mask-wearing in public was updated. In the new notice, both supermarkets and markets have been added to the list of public places where it is mandatory for residents to wear face masks while parks are still excluded. People don’t need to wear a mask when they are alone in places with a low risk of being infected, such as driving a private vehicle or walking alone in the park. Communities in Guangdong are required to implement closed-off management in all residential areas. Visitors including food and parcel delivery personnel and their vehicles are no longer allowed to enter a gated community.In the meanwhile, Guangdong continues to adhere to the promotion and implementation of prevention and control work based on the law. Those who commit crimes of impairing the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, using violence against medical workers, producing and/or selling fake products and spreading rumors during the coronavirus outbreak will face severe punishment from law enforcement agencies.""But that's nothing new. For several days now the delivery guys have not been allowed in and place the stuff on tables outside the gates. I get my temperature taken entering and when I go into supermarkets or restaurants."
"Frankly I have often thought that shutting down the entire country over this Coronavirus seems way excessive or overreacting, losing trillions in GDP and precious resources, set China back by years. I have never seen such drastic and draconian actions ever anywhere worldwide, I am watching history as it happen. I also wondered if this is just a very nasty serious flu. On the other hand, this is a government that created the China miracle, transformed a very very poor China in 40 years to the 2nd biggest economy modern country in the world, never has been done in human history. You can’t imagine how poor China was, I was first in China 27 years ago, they were dirt poor. This is a government with excessive brainpower and talents, if it takes 100 scientists to do some thing in the US, China throws in 10,000 scientists. Chinese communist party do everything by groups and committees, never one strongman makes decisions. Is it possible all the collective talents and scientific minds made a mistake? Mistaken a flu as a pandemic? Not only that, all the other governments and scientists made a mistake, treating a flu as pandemic? Something even a retired online poster know what it is. How likely is that?My next question, what do they know but not telling the public? Reminder, Spanish flu in 1918 killed 50 million people worldwide, 675,000 in the US, according to American CDC. That would be something big enough to shut down 1.4 billion people. Nah, that’s crazy."
#185 many countries will have legal powers in just such times to enforce infectious disease control. The general public don’t see what’s going on usually but when outside of epidemics there is always a small proportion of general infectious diseases around that authorities are enforcing quietly against individuals to stop further spread of diseases. Most times people comply and other times they don’t and that’s when drastic measures are needed to protect the wider public.People don’t comply or do the right thing for many reasons but all of those are subservient the general law concerning wider public health protection.

The figures are still very relevant and all we have to go with apart from speculation. In the absence of such figures it’s down to speculation, faith in deities and disbelief all of which will do diddly squat. The authorities with armies of experts know this and now acting drastically.Also, the difference between 1918 and 2020 in terms of globalisation, world governments responsibility and actions, modern people’s thinking and ability to handle risks 100 years apart are very different and not comparable."

"President Xi Jinping on Wednesday sought to send a message that progress had been made in bringing the coronavirus outbreak under control and, for most parts of the country, the focus should be on getting back to business.To me the key date will be 2/21 when people get back to work, 3/1 kids go back to schools, when people are busy running around daily, they don’t have time to sit there and worry about virus. They will realize none of the people they personally know are sick with virus, all life back to normal routine. They will realize this is not a huge deal as they feared. Deaths of 10,000 is certainly sad and significant, but by Chinese standard, earthquakes, floods, pandemics, civil wars, WW2, famines, culture revolution, historically that is trivia. They have suffered for 100 years, one built up resistance and resiliency.Now we are ready to enter the next phase, getting back to business. The fact Coronavirus happens during CNY is lucky, usually you lose 3-4 weeks of production during CNY, virus loss is about 2-3 weeks extra, manageable loss. Psychologically and daily life should be back to normal in most parts of the country by March. We have a lot of backlog orders to catch up, now let’s get ready to get back to work. Chi a will be back on its feet before you know it.Edited: 8:09 pm, February 12, 2020 "
"60,063 confirmed cases and 1,363 deaths as of Wednesday. It is not a typo.Edited: 8:35 pm, February 12, 2020 "
"The increase in reported cases came after they adopted a new methodology for counting. How the new methodology works, I have no idea."
"The number of cases in Mainland China outside Hubei has gone from 11,067 yesterday to 11,503 this morning. This is a bigger increase than in the last few days, but nothing like the leap in Hubei. I don't know how the counting procedure has changed either."
"Ok. They have added in patients in Hubei who have been ""clinically diagnosed"" to the previous number which only included those who tested positive for the virus. Basically, if the doctor says you've probably got it then you would be included. Hubei has not got the facilities to test all. The rest of China does."
"It does conveniently bring the death rate to a desired target of 2.2%. Daily death rates have been magically hitting the 2.1% range. Surprisingly the hyper jump in numbers in one day is sort of nonevent, nobody is shocked, just, okay..... whatever you say. Let’s get back to business on 2/21 and move on."
The extra number of cases were known in the WHO incident report dated 12/2/20 as suspected cases so now they have simply decided add the two https:/… I recall seeing suspected cases being available before that.
"Hi SimonSaysPDXShuttle - I have traveled to China over 70 times since 2007 on business. That includes working in Guangzhou in 2016. Under normal times, Guangzhou is a great city which I know very well. But these are not normal times. For the record I would like to point out that you are disregarding a Level 4 Do Not Travel Warning from the US State Department and when you come back to the United States you and your family may be subject to a 14-day day quarantine. I use WeChat very frequently with 200 WeChat connections and I can speak, read and write Mandarin passably. I have access to several Chinese websites only available in WeChat. They are in Mandarin. Let me give you the coronavirus statistics as of today February 13, 2020. In Guangzhou itself there are total coronavirus cases of 327 cases. Out of these, 78 have recovered and been discharged from the hospital and 249 are still in the hospital. For all of Guangdong Province, there are a total of 1241 coronavirus cases. Out of these 314 have been discharged from the hospital, there have been 2 deaths and 925 are still in the hospital. If in fact you do make the trip, I have the following recommendations. Stay in the Tianhe Business District in one of the well-known Western brand hotels. I stayed in the Guangzhou Sheraton Tianhe Hotel. Avoid taking the Guangzhou subway. It is the most crowded in China. During normal times it is OK but with the coronavirus epidemic it may not be a good idea. Obviously follow self-protection measures. I believe that you are required to wear a mask in China during the epidemic. The 3M N95 mask is the best type. Bring a lot of hand sanitizer with you. Wash your hands frequently with soap and warm water for 30 seconds and avoid touching your face, eyes, nose or mouth. Bring Lysol with you for disinfecting. I believe that you will find that Guangzhou may not be as crowded as usual but try to avoid crowds. I am not trying to create any fear or panic. I am just trying to give you advice. Ask the bellman of your hotel to order you a Didi taxi with his smartphone. Then give him cash plus a small tip for the ride. I found the regular Guangzhou taxi drivers to be very dishonest. Didi taxi drivers were very professional. As noted, you need a Chinese bank account to pay with Alipay or WeChat pay. I just cancelled my business trip to China and I plan to wait until the epidemic is over and heed the Level 4 Do Not Travel warning. But if you do go especially with taking your family, I would take this very seriously and take every precaution. Good luck and have a safe trip."
"I received a significant good news today that many of our Chinese suppliers, agents and managers are allowed to return to the big cities to start working as early as 2/18. Before this weekend, all of them who went away to nearby home villages were not allowed to return to big cities where they live and work. This is the first concrete action that China is getting ready to go back to business. Once people start to work, majority of the population will get back to normal life, on the road to recovery of the nation."
"(Similar to Mac""s message, just above...)I have two friends in Kunming who are both civil servants. Tomorrow the office is open and they are scheduled to resume work from their office tomorrow, instead of just working from home as they have been.Edited: 4:48 pm, February 16, 2020 "
Is that really good news? or a sign they need to get their country running again and that money comes before health? the only good news would be a significant reduction in new cases which has not happened? maybe now with people returning to work daily infections will increase?
"No business no jobs, no jobs no money, no money no food, no money no medicine, no money no cloth, no money no tuition. Something rich people don’t understand. As life gets normal with busy nonstop daily routine, preparing breakfast, dropping off kids, phone calls, emails, production lines, meetings, groceries, pick up kids, dinner. People don’t have time to cry or fear the imaginary bogeyman and let imagination run wild. People who don’t work for a living will not understand.By now, 1.4 billion healthy people have been in quarantine for 3 weeks, enough is enough. Let’s get back to work, get back to life. As panic swept the land, behind the spotlight and with levelheaded skills, teams of economists and officials calculated and plan the recovery timetable, that’s is what a good government should do, for the people."
"On 13th February when they changed the counting rules to include probable cases with confirmed cases, there were 11,503 cases in China outside Hubei. On the 17th there are 12,363 cases. Does that increas justify the continuation.of the lockdown? It doesn't for me.Figures from.the John's Hopkins site:https:/…This article shows what has been happening in Shenzhen. There is a spike in new cases at the normal end of.the holiday, but otherwise very few cases for a city of this size. I expect to.see another spike as more people move about and chaos as they take the temperature of all the new returnees, by plane, train, ferry, bus and carhttps:/…3M9oG04_AY7sVH9fMq3q5w"
"73,433 confirmed cases. 1873 death."
"Hey Mac, heard anything more from the folks you deal with in China as to when they may get factories back in gear and at what capacity? Seems like the U.S. national news is just picking up on the economic impact this is having worldwide.Edited: 11:56 am, February 18, 2020 "
"Zhejiang area, such as Yiwu back to work 2/18, allowed back to cities couple days before. Saw an official video a woman in uniform announcing Yiwu is open for business. Shanghai Yangtze River delta, back to work, allowed back few days ago.Guangzhou opens for business 2/21. Delta area is few days behind in opening up for return, some vendors not allowed back yet. Not news nor official edicts, but actual reports from vendors. All of them work in big cities, but all originally came from nearby villages where their parents are. Once we drove past a rice paddy with our trading agent, he said he was working in his family’s rice paddy every year until he graduated from university’s international trade dept last year. I was repeatedly shocked how fast so many of them can transform from a Chinese peasant into an international business person, most are women."
Perhaps from Chinese peasant to international business person is not a big transformation. Perhaps they may get more respect from some people simply by wearing different clothes? Even the women!
"International trading takes great deal of skills in dealing with multiple layers of suppliers, factories, buyers, finance, documentations and varies testing and government rules and laws. Has nothing to do with the cloth one wears. Not to mention multiple languages skills in reading, writing and speaking."
And even peasants can learn to do that? Wow!
"Behind the China economic miracle, there are 100 millions of individual stories just like that. In the 10 years span that rice paddy kid worked with us, he set up 3 factories and made 100 million pens for us. We were his first and only customer. Within 2 years, he bought apartment, car and got married, built a small trading company with couple dozen employees. Multiplying that story 100 million times. How did you think it was done? Not much different than the American story, most richest American people started with nothing in garages, Apple, google, HP, etc. still happening as we speak."
"#224/#226 contains a big dose of discrimination.*Anybody* can learn to do whatever you and I know how to do, given the opportunity. It is a question of opportunity. Chinese went through so much turmoil since the late Qing dynasty (result - Hong Kong/Macau), then the 1911 revolution, which was a good thing, but then the corrupt generals/warlords. Then the Japanese invasion. Then the Communist party took over, with Mao's Big Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution and such. For the past 100 to 200 years, reading Chinese history just wanted to make one cry. It wasn't until Dang's economic reform that finally helped the country propel forward in the past 30 - 40 years.Chinese women had always been cast in the shadow, deep-rooted in the culture's belief. My wife was one of the few woman engineers, certified PE, in the field dominated by men. Yeah her parents were those ""peasants"" in the poor countryside of Taishan. They did not have the education opportunity like my wife did.You get respect simply by wearing different cloths?Edited: 6:12 pm, February 18, 2020 "
"When you look at those modern high rise office and residential buildings, who work and live there? These former peasants. Many of our agents and vendors offices are on 30th to 40th floors, and they now live in those high rises. Trade wars or virus, they have resilience, they bounce back faster than you can imagine, why? They were dirt poor before, they are not afraid of challenges and setbacks, no matter what happen, they will still be 100 times better off than 5-10-20 years ago. You can’t keep them down for long. Just received reports while our China offices are operational, factories are still closed, but luckily received government permission to go online 2/20. Our packaging operation is not yet online, as our products need to be repackaged for US market. That should be back within days. Many products need to add special labels, the print factory is in Dongguan, not online yet. Different schedules for different areas and types of businesses. We rush airfreight inventory in December due to trade war, and again emptied out our China and Japan warehouses before Chinese New Year, we are well stocked unaffected by virus. These were done not related to Coronavirus, so we lucked out. I expect the soonest next shipment leaves China 3/1, be here 4/1. All back to normal by March and April with steady stream of shipments coming out of China."
#228 I think you completely missed the point of my posts. It wasn't me that classified people with the prevorative label of peasant.
For people like me who play with numbers:Additional cases since they changed the definition on 13th February:Hubei - 13676Rest of China - 1001Deaths:Hubei - 611Rest of China - 29
"75196 confirmed cases. 2010 death. 2/18. Peasant is a badge of honor in China since the revolution, people take pride in their peasant origin. Similarly in the US, those successful individuals who started from nothing take pride in their humble origins. Farmers are well respected in the US. Unlike UK or India where class system is rigid."
"I have been warned by freight forwarders, the shipping cost will be ridiculously high in the coming weeks, as capacity has been cut by 80%, will be difficult to get shipping space on the sea and in the air, very few flights remain, plus all importers worldwide are scrambling to ship out of China."
"This is very odd. Bloomberg. A surge in coronavirus cases and deaths in Iran is raising concern because the outbreak can’t be traced directly back to China, the head of the World Health Organization said.The cases, which suggest rapid spread in a country outside of the epidemic’s center in China, are “very worrisome,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters Friday at a press briefing in Geneva. The window of opportunity to stop the spread in countries outside the place where it began is “really narrowing,” he said. “This outbreak could go in any direction.”In Iran, there have been 18 cases and four deaths in just the past two days, Tedros said. One case was also reported Friday in Lebanon that was directly linked to Iran. Health experts are racing to limit new cases outside China, where severe quarantine measures are in place."
"""Although many experts continue to stress the need to fight the spread of the virus at every turn, others already see containment as being a lost cause.Osterholm said it was now clear that the virus was transmitted in a similar way to influenza, rather than diseases such as Sars and Mers, which were successfully contained in the past, making efforts to control its spread analogous to “trying to stop the wind”.“At this point, I think it really is a matter of reorienting what we’re doing,” he said.“It is all about, at this point, how do we prepare our hospitals and our communities to deal with this.”“Much of our containment activities are akin to fixing three of the five screen doors on your submarine,” added Osterholm. “I don’t think it’s really going to matter any more. This thing is out""Source: https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-enviro…More and more experts agree containment has failed - or only slowed down the virus. It will be interesting to see how this evolves. But Iran cases clearly shows that not well developed countries will not even notice an outbreak themselves if it is low scale only. I've said it in January, I say it now. It's way too late to stop it (could have been done by strict quarantine in December maybe - but no later anymore). The best thing now is to prepare for alternative ways of coping with it - setting up huge temporary hospitals, working on vaccine ready for next year - and so on. Quarantining the whole world does not work anymore the way our industry works.People should stay at home as long as they have only little fever/symptoms - hospitals need to be separated into those for Covid-19/influenza vs hospitals not treating Covid-19. And don't be afraid if you catch it - stay positive - the earlier you get it the less overstretched your local hospital system will be. And try to get out of less developed countries early enough - not what is early enough I don't know myself. I kinda guess quarantine measures will ease at some point soon.4 deaths and 18 cases in Iran means most likely way more undetected cases. Also by now more and more cases appear that cannot be traced back. And it seems more asymptomatic cases appear. Maybe the first sign of less virulent virus mutation."
"""More and more experts agree containment has failed - or only slowed down the virus."" - Realistically they knew they could never fully contain the virus at least not after they had already waited too long to take action. The goal of containment at this point is really to slow the spread enough to buy time for the development of potential treatments before it spreads to the global population at large and in that sense there has been some success."
"Yep,.I guess many just didn't want to see it. Containment would have been possible maybe in December, January it was already too late, but wrong decisions speeded it up. That's why I am also afraid about Chaos in countries that are so far unaffected officially soon..Besides maybe Southern hemisphere I expect many infections everywhere in 1-3 months and overcrowded hospitals.."
"Original Guangzhou markets opening on 2/21-24 has been postponed indefinitely, news report said maybe 3/10, but will see.Wholesale markets vendors are mostly small family operators, I've seen some out of business already, they quit. Most businesses only have enough cash to last one month without doing business."
"In my actual experience working with Chinese agent and factories in Zhejiang and Guangdong, no factory has reopened, none. None are allowed to reopen, as of today, few minutes ago."
"Reported on 25th Feb., the resumption rate of industrial enterprises has gradually increased, Zhejiang has exceeded 90%, Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian, Liaoning, Guangdong and Jiangxi have exceeded 70%.Reported on 25th Feb., 508 new cases were confirmed. Among them, 499 new cases were confirmed in Hubei Province. Most provices have 0 new cases for days. Some parks, tourist attractions are reopened."
"Security companies keep track of energy production by how much coal is used in power plants, the current capacity is somewhere under 50% of same period last year, the conclusion is rate is about 40% of normal. They also track transportation usage, traffic condition, the workforce return rate is also far less.90% production rate is propaganda, not fact. We are in constant contact with vendors in Zhejiang and Guangdong, all factories and wholesale markets are closed, completely closed, as of today. The rumor is 3/10, just no official announcement."
"Some of our Zhejiang supply factories are opened 2 days ago, main problem is shortage of workers, workers refuse to return to work, they are sending transportation, including buses and charter planes. Guangzhou area is still closed.  Japanese suppliers are delaying new product releases by 2 months to May. At least first sign of an estimate timetable. Our label printers in Dongguan and Yiwu are back online. They are sending product labels to Tokyo this afternoon, and Zhejiang factories already received labels from Dongguan printing factory today. First sign of real production. Domestic and international package delivery services are operational. Export freight cost will be extremely high, no shipment leaving China for 6 weeks, 0ver 80% flights canceled, there will be severe shortage of shipping spaces. Next battlefront is booking ship spaces. US hardliners advocate decoupling China, now they are getting a taste of what it is like to live without Chinese factories, what happens to US economy, worst drop in US stock market ever this week, this is only the beginning. We start to make contingency plan for severe US economic downturn, stock, real estate, etc.. Trump must be worried, it is the economy.Edited: 11:14 pm, February 27, 2020 "
"Some factories have definitely opened. I know factory owners who actually got calls from their local government officials asking them to open ASAP. However, downstream supply limitations and workers return rate are hindering their efforts. I have not seen anything about workers not wanting to return. Transport is limited though. Also, quarantine laws are applied unevenly. A worker might not be able to leave his/her area even though the factory area has no restrictions.Expect a shortage of goods on the shelves globally during the spring/summer months. If no more mass infections occur, I expect the fall/winter to return to somewhat normal, but there could still be issues."

"Our first shipment out of China has been scheduled March 9th. It is happening, step by step, signs of life like flowers in the Spring coming out. ETA USA April 1st. Original back to work after CNY was 2/5. Actually back on 2/25. Lost of 20 days or 3 weeks. Absolutely remarkable. China managed it exceptionally well."
