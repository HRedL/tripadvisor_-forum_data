"This article was published today on Trade Travel Maldives' website (link at the end of post) and sets out a hope that The Maldives may be in a position to start welcoming tourists again by the last quarter of 2020. Maldives Tourism Minister Ali Waheed has announced that the country will commence “safe tourism” within three months where government will target to make Maldives a COVID-19 free country.Speaking at an online session of the Economic Committee of the parliament, Minister said that Maldivians could breathe a sigh of relief if the country could take a step back from the current safety measures put in place, if those measures are implemented well enough.“With in the next three months, the Maldives will become the first COVID-19 free country in the Asia region hopefully. We are conducting surveys to begin safe tourism when we reach that road,“ said Minister.The Minister further added that the government’s first and foremost priority was the safety of its citizens and that the government was taking steps to ensure that the businesses of investors do not fall apart.“No leader of any country in the world is able to predict when they can overcome the crisis, and until a vaccine for the virus is found the world will be in a state of anxiety where rapid decisions will be taken,” said the Minister.“We still view this situation as the edge of the storm. Until a vaccine is found, we should not lose focus and get distracted from the seriousness of the situation.”He added that Maldives had targeted two million tourist arrivals and that tourist arrivals into the country, which has been completely halted due to the pandemic. The Minister stated that if things go well, the country can start welcoming tourists once again in the last quarter of the year hopefully.https:/…Edited: 5:58 am, April 13, 2020 "
"It sounds hopeful if a tad optimistic, in my opinion but who knows."
Would be great if this happens but I agree with Dianna it may be a little optimistic. We would usually have booked by now for next March but are not going to do anything until much later in the year and in fact may even wait until last minute.
"In my opinion, the Maldivian government can make plans in order to keep the spirit local alive. But Maldives tourism can not function without the international flight companies. If there are no flights the tourism will not start up. And as soon passenger flights start to open up. The tourism and as such,Maldivian economy will start up also. Maldives is not a country like Spain, France etc. That can rely on domestic tourism. Stay Safe!"
"We have usually booked by now for our Jan/Feb holiday. But like Moirad, we won’t book now, if at all, until the last minute. Additionally, our travel insurance currently covers us for ‘epidemics,’ but I bet when we renew it in September, that clause will have been quietly removed."
"I too feel this is rather optimistic, but am sure The Maldives will want to maximise the possibility of welcoming tourists back for the key Christmas and New Year season. A case of watch & wait but certainly wishing them all the very best with their endeavours and goal of being the first COVID free country in Asia. Looking forward to returning sometime in the future, who knows when."
As much as I would love the Maldives to reopen for business that will not be the issue...international air travel for the very foreseeable future will simply not happen...as an example in Australia the borders will be closed indefinitely (we currently have incredibly low rates of death compared to the rest of the world) and there is no way that will change...there is simply no way the Government here would allow its citizens to fly off to the Maldives for a holiday and then return without 14 days minimum quarantine when they return assuming there was any airline prepared or even able to fly them there and back...so sorry anyone thinking of returning to the Maldives anytime soon is simply delusional
"Wow, last quarter of 2020. Very sad. Well looks like we won't be going next April or ever. Guess it just wasn't meant to be. I feel for the poor workers who will be out of a job/paycheck for 9 months or longer."
So sad. We're currently booked for August. Wan ted to rebook rather than cancel but the rates are just too high in other more high season dates. We got such a great deal that it can't be matched. I think we have no choice but to cancel.
"its not the maldives thats is not safe， it is the tourist thats bring the virus that makes maldives unsafethere are rumors that they are going to open up china market again very soon. then I tot， who is going？ when it comes to life and death， even a slim chance would。scare ppl off no matter how much discount there isEdited: 12:46 pm, April 13, 2020 "
"Surely that statement from the Minister for Tourism means that the ban on the issue of visas for tourists will be in place for some time to come..... no tourists can visit (or more correctly enter the country) until the ban is lifted, even from China."
"The bigger issue will be the staff which are mainly from the Indian sub continent. Here the virus will inevitably run rife and unchecked among a population of plus 1.5 billion people with poor health care, hygiene, education and poverty Add this to the majority of staff in resorts living in shared accommodation in enclosed spaces, personally I don’t see opening in Q3 2020 is in any way viable.Q3 2021 is probably more realistic. There is hope that an effective treatment or vaccine will be developed but it will take a long time to distribute on this scale"
"subadai if the resorts stay closed until Q3 2021 there will be no maldives left for us to visit. these resorts cannot stay closed for a year and a half. they will all go out of business. there is so much maintenance that needs to be done to these islands, regardless of whether the resorts are open or not, and a lot of these resorts cannot afford to do maintenance for 18 months with 0 operating income. it’s just not realistic.Edited: 8:15 pm, April 13, 2020 "
"The Maldives has to find a way to transition to safe/safer tourism. It is just a matter of finding out how to manage these new risks. From a team perspective, the idea will be to test all of our team. Any team member returning from leave will require to self isolate for 14 days and tested. The challenge will be how do we manage the risk of infected guests arriving on resort. Hoping that some type of health passport is used before guests get on a flight. And testing on arrival to the Maldives. The Maldives will need to find a way to reopen."
"Sevidlam of course you are correct the unfortunate fact is many resorts, airlines, tourism companies will go out of business. For many this is already happening. What are the options to avoid this?1) Vaccine at least another year If even possible remember the common cold is a Corona Virus2) discovery of effective treatment to reduce severity of illness This will take time to find, clinically prove and scale 3) Testing regularly otherwise it’s almost pointless imagine the scale of the required testing it will take time to meet worldwide demand 4) Herd immunity over 70% of population must contract and recover this will take time to achieve and needs to be controlled so health care systems don’t collapse5) Just let the virus spread let people die and tourists take the risk and pay there own medical and repatriation bills as insurance won’t provide cover this is shockingly expensive.Unfortunately we are just at the beginning of this There is no quick fix .As long as a single person anywhere in the world has the virus it will continue to spread we are in this for the long term.Will things get better yes of course but its not realistic to expect it to happen within a year"
"The points made here, and many more, are all considerations. I still think that there are too many unknowns at this stage for me to form many educated views about how the future will look. The one thing I do think will be imperative, requires central planning, and can be planned now - is healthcare provision. I think the Maldives is going to have to ensure it can provide critical care, quickly and easily, in hospitals that western tourists recognise as being of an acceptable standard to them. And the resorts are going to need to demonstrate appropriate healthcare facilities as well as the ability to transfer people. I’m specifically saying ‘demonstrate’ etc because I suspect people are going to need assurance that this stuff is in place.And (last and!) TBH, I think that if travel insurance policies are going to exclude covid-19 for the time being, any tourist destination that wants to reopen is going to have to offer that healthcare FOC as part of the resort package should it be required."
"I think that as long as there is no vaccine developed (and available) or an existing medication found (and available), the only two options would be - aside from all precautionary hygienical measurements - to either „cope“ with the virus and the inherent danger of infection or to really reduce tourism to the minimum for certain (not necessarily wealth related) groups of people. For the post vaccine era, a health-care passport, as it has been already suggested, seems a reasonable idea. like people are prohibited from immigration, if they stayed in „yellow fever regions“ prior to arrival today, people without valid vaccination proof could be prohibited from entering the Maldives (or even travelling in general) in the future. During the „pre-vaccination“ period, the only method to avoid any risk would be, in addition to for example Jason’s proposal regarding staff, to enforce tourists to stay in self-quarantine before travelling. The testing on the airport sounds easier than it actually seems. Many of the recently developed „fast“ tests with „results“ within minutes, which it would require to guarantee relatively smooth operations on arrival, are still unreliable, and test on antibodies, which develop in a sufficient number after several days and not directly after infection. What will you do, if you really had an aircraft with one or two positive testings onboard? Send them back, quarantaine all crew and passengers for days? Who will cover the expenditures. In a pre vaccination/medicine era, you will not be able to combine risk-free travelling with mass-tourism (or at least arrival numbers similar to those before COVID outbreak). So either operate with a certain risk left, impose severe restricirons and measurements on tourists in advance of their arrivals or limit tourism to an absolute minimum of people who will stay longterm and may not worry about spending hours at a quarantine facility at the airport and wait for their then negative result for a reliable test, before travelling to their resort island.Edited: 8:28 am, April 14, 2020 "
Super interesting conversation. I appreciate the insights.
"there is a newly confirmed local case today after shut down days agothis is gonna be a long lasting event. before vaccines I doult ppl will risk their lives coming to maldives mostly likely this is gonna be a 1930 replay.there is a newly confirmed case a couple of blocks near my place today in beijing. imported from US14 days quarantine with 2 tests came back negative. on the 16th day symptoms started to surface and he got admited to hospital. poor dude lives with his parents the whole family is at high risk.I haven't had adinner with my parents for almost 3 months. a few times I visit them. I spray my self and items to be exchanged.Edited: 7:52 am, April 15, 2020 "
"Can the country/resorts even survive that long? I thought I read somewhere that 75% of their GDP is from tourism?They've been shutdown from what, 4/1/20, and even if they open in Q4 (October 1, 2020 at the earliest), that's 6 months without any income, and if it's delayed to 12/31/20, that'll be 9 months.I just don't see many resorts making it out if that happens. But maybe I'm just not aware of how things really work there and such.Fingers crossed that things will be better than forecast."
@MjonisMy guess is that only the strongest will survive there existing ownership. The Maldives is blessed by nature and will always be a unique and popular destination so there will always be buyers who will take a long term view and get a low price for the resorts that don’t make it through this crisis
This is extracted from the Emirates website. Emirates have become the first Airline that will commence COVID-19 rapid testing fro all passengers. Each test will take approximately 10 minutes. All Emirates aircraft will go through enhanced cleaning and disinfection processes in Dubai after each journey.
"There’s already a thread on the tests Emirates appear to be using which casts some doubt on their reliability: https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g293…Edited: 11:48 pm, April 15, 2020 "
"Potentially the biggest problem tourists may face is the availability of travel and medical insurance that will cover Covid 19 virtually all policies are now excluding Covid claims.To cover the potential costs of medical treatment, isolating costs and repatriation if deceased would more than likely run in to $20,000 - $50,000 that’s probably a risk most tourists would not be happy to take on.It may be the Maldives Government could come up with a plan to negate this but I’m not sure they will"
"Emirates testing programme feels to me like a thing they are doing in order to be seen to do it - I don’t really hugely get the value, at this stage anyway. But WRT to cleaning, it makes me really grumpy (and I am not a grumpy type of person) that airlines, and all hospitality type businesses really, just now decide that enhanced cleaning and disinfection processes are a good idea. (I’m irritatingly un-grumpy but also a bit of a germaphobe!)"
"I suspect the COVID exclusions will only continue if it becomes endemic and at the same levels of risk. In which case we probably have bigger things to worry about.I doubt it will go away, but as we understand it better and find treatments, the actuaries will be able to calculate the risk and factor it into the premium like any other disease.I suspect the bigger issue will be the removal of Pandemic cover. Many insurers had already taken this step after SARS & H1N1. I suspect it will be very difficult to get Pandemic cover going forward. At least for a few years as the under writers lick their wounds.IMO resorts will have to step in and fill the gap if they want to restart tourism. By offering rebooking in case of Pandemic. Otherwise who will realistically risk £5-£20k in the next year or two, whilst the holidays people lost are still in their memory."
Two new cases have now been confirmed on Male itself and the capital city is on lockdown. Those affected are in individual and their child. With Male being so densely populated that's pretty awful news.
update for post 18： this student actually has cleared 3 tests after 14 days quarantine.he then was sent home to his parent ，grandpa and maid. now 3 of his family members test positive and 62 ppl with close contact quarantinedthe bug is a real family killed， you get it then anyone you cherish in your life is in grave danger. given that fact， there is no safe tourism until the bug is taken out
Maldives HPA Is now reporting that a 7th individual has tested positive for COVID-19.
And now Maldives in lock down 14 days https://edition.mv/news/16188
"Looks like a very strict lockdown which is probably exactly what Male requires. They still have a good chance to track contact trace and test I really hope it doesn’t spread in such a densely populated areaEdited: 6:51 am, April 17, 2020 "

I was meant to fly out this June 17th 2020 is so sad rhag it will be cancelled
They will open on the 01 of July
"My travel agent informed me today, that international flights will be allowew from July but resorts may not open for foreign guests before August.10% of the rooms have to be kept as a reserve / quarantine area."
I think they are giving resorts the green light to reopen on 1 July (as of now... things can change in a matter of days). Now whether resorts will effectively want to reopen on 1 July that is a different story... i know that Baglioni for example has delayed opening until August and Maalifushi until October 1.

"Interesting, if any buffet food will be available at all within the next year."
"Buffet i believe will still exist (Like other holiday destinations) only the food will be now behind glass and plated by staff (No self service). The same of the beverage outlets. (And coffee and Tea facilities in public spaces) With pre packed Salt/Pepper, Sugar etc."
"Interesting, if the perceived value is still fine..... we have a nice offer for Vakkaru in October....."
