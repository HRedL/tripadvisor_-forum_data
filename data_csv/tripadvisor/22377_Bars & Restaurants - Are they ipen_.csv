"Hi All,can someone from Albufeira help my query, are restaurants and bars open or are they closed? Im hearing there are special measures in place and they are closed...supermarkets also on restrictions? Is this correct, due to arrive Sumday, but to a flat not hotel...can you advise, really appreciate some feedback"
Hi I'm in the same situation as you hopefully all still open
"I'm hearing there are special measures in place - announced yesterday, restaurants have to reduce the seating capacity to 1/3, clubs and similar (whatever this means) have to be closed, Shopping malls/supermarkets have to manage the number of people inside (how? I have no idea)."
"Thank you, appreciated. I hear Portugese PM is making a statement later. See what happens.Thanks again."
"not reduce to a third. it is reduce by a thirdmalls and supermarket to have queuing outside the building not inside when they reduce number of clientsie all measures are common senseEdited: 7:11 am, March 13, 2020 "
"The Cttage - you have a restaurant so you should know it, but in portuguese ""Reduzir a um terço a lotação de estabelecimentos de restauração"" which is what's on several news, it's not reduce by a third..."
will wait and see as conflicting views on what was said by costa.
Redução da lotação máxima em 1/3. from rtp web site
"Trying to ""discover"" something from an official government website..."

and just as importance - when does this reduction in capacity start?
"at least one case in Albufeira (Forte do Vale) changes everything ... although apparently brought in by a Canadian who visited Morocco .. possibly caught in transit through Spain, ship, etc ... who can you trust now ?"
"Sorry got it in a file https:/… It's ""Redução da lotação máxima em 1/3."""
come on PTnov 64 - I get the impression you are Portuguese? Scroll down the article you linked to and click the link above the picture and then click on the ficheiros link and its all there!!!!https:/…
haha both at same time!! In effect from when?
"Isn't,the case , the Canadian you referred to.Why should any one be surprised that Portugal is getting cases.It will soon reach 100.."
"Do you have information contrary to that posted on the news site about the Canadian staying at Forte do Vale .. would you like to share it with us, Terry ?Edited: 11:27 am, March 13, 2020 "
Updated in the Portugal News.
"No idea what that means Terry .... here is the link to SIC storyyesterday and reaction from Forte do Vale management ..https://sicnoticias.pt/especiais/coronavirus…they say an excursion to Spain .. maybe not Morocco ... or maybe it was .Edited: 12:57 pm, March 13, 2020 "
"Then look at todays Portugal news.That is where the Canadian was staying, he is now in intensive care in Faro, doing as well as expected."
Well are the bars and restaurants still open people going off topic here
Yes but by law reducing their seating capacity.No clubs open.

"I was due to fly to Faro on Saturday 21st March 2020 with Easyjet. We were contacted by the company who we had booked excursions with to say that the Algarve and Porto were the hot spots and some restaurants, bars etc had already taken the decision to close/reduce numbers. As it was likely monuments, museums etc would follow suit along with the closure of schools and universities in the coming days, our trips were cancelled and refunded. We took the decision to postpone the whole trip as we have no idea if the flight would leave on Saturday, there would be something to do when we got there, and we whether we could get home again. As things change on a daily basis, you are pretty much going to have to make up your own mind. Easyjet are currently allowing you to change bookings free of charge, just paying the difference in the cost of the flight. We couldn't really cancel as we booked everything separately, but hopefully might get away later in the year."
Portugal due to peak early May.........
