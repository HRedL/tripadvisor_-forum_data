I will be in Singapore on the 12th of feb. What do you think the chances are that Singapore will close all their attractions and public places down like Hong Kong is doing due to the corona virus? We plan on going to universal studios.
"Pretty near to zero.Considering the boarder controls and no sign yet that the virus has spread within the community there is little chance that things will close.Life continues as normal here in Singapore, well apart from seeing the paranoid walking around wearing masks..."
Likely will not have a chance.
"There's no local transmission here yet. We've also closed our borders to China travelers, so 30,000 mainlanders on work passes here are temporarily prohibited from returning after the CNY holidays.HK hasn't completely ruled out that 2 of their confirmed cases may be locally transmitted. They've also refused to completely close their borders, despite Guangdong across the border currently being the 3rd most-infected province. Pre-protests, 1.2 million mainlanders had visited HK during the CNY holidays last year."
"I hope not! Just had to cancel our HK trip due to most places being closed down, dont want to cancel the Singapore trip too! I do have alot of faith in Singapore though, such a clean place and theyre being really proactive in trying to stop the spread of the virus."
"No new cases reported on Sunday, 2 Feb 2020 in Singapore. Hopefully this continues. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/wuhan…"
"Universal Studios should be business as usual.Edited: 12:38 pm, February 03, 2020 "
"USS was unusually quiet over this weekend, so it's possible they'll reduce opening hours, but I doubt it it'll be before March."
"Are there additional thoughts in light of the 4 cases of local transmission reported today. The Straits Times suggested that closures are under consideration. I am very sad to be considering cancelling a trip I planned over a year ago, but I also don't want to fly 18 hours to be trapped in a hotel room with all the sights closed."
The situation is much more serious than yesterday.Be cautious and aware of future disruptions.
"Obviously only you can decide whether you're willing to travel or not. All I can say living here is that my family and I have not changed our lifestyle. We're not wearing masks, avoiding human contact or anything like that. I still travel in the region, and so far only China is on our company's do not travel list. In terms if what's open, there's a whole lot more to Singapore than USS. To date, the very limited local transmission cases are those who had close contact with visitors from China.Remember to wash your hands regularly and practice good hygenie.Edited: 9:48 am, February 04, 2020 "
"I haven't heard of any plans to close USS, nor any other attractions.The infections came from a known source, a group of Chinese tourists, the Chinese government has stopped tourist groups from going abroad, and Singapore no longer accepts visitors from China.The Singapore health ministry have said they'd be much more worried if the source was not known.Yes, it's bad news, but nothing has changed here.As Simon says, do wash your hands properly - and that takes 30 seconds (or sing Happy Birthday twice)."
"""No local transmission yet"". there is now. whats the atmosphere like over there?"
">>whats the atmosphere like over there?<<No different to what it was yesterday and the day before that and I don't think it'll change tomorrow either.As reported cases such as these were to be expected.We are not even a week into the border controls, therefore there will be some cases popping up for those who were unfortunately exposed to infected people before the lock down occurred."
"Im not worried about the virus itself, more worried about tourist attractions and theme parks closing before we get there in 3 weeks"
"I also think there is very little chance things will close, unless the situation becomes A LOT worse.As for the last post:""Im not worried about the virus itself, more worried about tourist attractions and theme parks closing before we get there in 3 weeks""Er...yes, but the chance of closure depends on how the virus situation develops...I am also based in SG and the only big precaution I am taking is hand sanythiser more often than I used to, and hand washing but mostly as much as I used to anyway. My workplace has cancelled quite a number of events, which seems very cautious to me but I guess they're better safe than sorry. Last weekend, tourist areas looked a lot quieter than usual, but nothing looks like threatening to close. Unless, as I mentioned, things get suddenly (or slowly) worse. But that has to do with the virus itself, you know ;)"
"It will all depend on community spread - right now, it appears to be a local transmission and they can trace it back to the source - a Chinese tourist. If other locals start to contract the virus and it can't be traced - then you will start to see further restrictions. The next few days should tell us a lot..."
i was due to stay in Marina Bay from 15th to 24th feb. Cancelled the whole singapore trip today and they were kind enough to waive fees and provide a full refund. Cancelled more out of the risk of being quarantined if the local clusters spread more so than catching the virus. 14 day quarantine would drive me demented.
">>i was due to stay in Marina Bay from 15th to 24th feb<<Fair do's, that's your choice.But given that's 14 days after the boarder restrictions I would suspect chances are reducing daily of local spread.The cases reported yesterday, they are only looking to contact 5 more people out of 304 that came into contact with those infected."
I think the next few days will tell a lot . Could still be plenty around infected but still in the incubation period . And if the virus can spread in the incubation stage then it goes on and on . It was a risk assessment . Gutted as I was looking forward to spending time in Singapore . But the right decision . Hopefully will get to rebook next year . Hope all goes as you expect and the worst of it has passed over there . Good luck
"Mmmm19, probably should have worded my comment more carefully.I meant im not worried about catching the virus in Singapore as the risk is currently pretty low, unless things change"
"I would disagree with Simon. Singapore now has 28 confirmed cases and rising. It is the 3rd most infected place in the world. Weigh the evidence, make up your own mind. I’ve told my loved ones to delay coming here.https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"
Universal Studios was great today! 5 -10 minutes wait for all rides! If this is the plus point for people not coming i'm all for it (Just a joke)
Stay safe
"Usually a good indication of how serious the situation is whether the government is closing down schools. They haven’t yet, but did implement a series of measures to curb mass assemblies in schools etc. To me personally it means the situation is getting a little serious but not out-of-control yet (at moment of writing). Should the government be closing down schools in the near future, I think closing down attractions like USS is a distinct possibility. Imho."
"#21 as I said in my original post ""only you can decide"". I was only speaking in terms of how I see it thus far,and what we're doing/feeling. Every one needs to make their own assessment.No travel restrictions in our business apart from China. The best resource for making this assessment is the MOH Web site: https://www.moh.gov.sg/2019-ncov-wuhanEdited: 9:19 am, February 06, 2020 "
Thanks. Aslong as you stick maintaining good hygiene I think you will be 100% ok.
We are now up to 30 confirmed cases in Singapore1 is critically ill. Others in quarantine https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/
"I don't think much will close down in singapore. But we would have arrived on Wed 19 Feb and then on sapphire princess sun23 for 7 days. All of the information I have read has caused us to cancel the trip. Even if we still went, Thu fun of the trip is gone."
"I see most visitors here are extremely happy that the attractions are not as crowded. No queues in Singapore, that's really strange!If you think that you will not enjoy your trip because you will be worried throughout the trip, then you should cancel the trip. But if you're concerned whether attractions/restaurants/businesses will be closed, I don't see any signs of that happening. I've been out without wearing masks, most of us don't, but I'm certainly more vigilant in terms of looking out for people coughing/sneezing and washing hands more frequently. If you observe common-sense personal hygiene (like not sucking your fingers after touching a railing) and wash your hands more diligently, I don't see anything that you need to be worried about. Come over and share the heat! I'm scorched! ;D"
"Another flight from Wuhan planned to repatriate Singaporeans from epicentrehttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/healt…Measures placed in schools often later become measures placed in society. Social distancing measures implemented at schools in Singapore (new for Feb 6) - precautionary.“The announcement on 4 February by MOH of a few cases with no travel history to China marked a new phase of local transmission.Hence, MOE decided to stop mass events in schools like assemblies and camps. Given that there is no evidence of community spread as yet, there is no need to stop mass events but we are taking precautions for vulnerable groups, such as pre-schools and school children.”https:/…faqs-wuhan-coronavirus-infectionI think Community Spread is next. Growth at around 10% a day so far. Come but be careful. If with kids, stay home"
Travel addict Is it ok out there when going out we are there on 20th and wnated some info from people already there.could you update on how daily life is and are touriat spots safe?
"@Odera1. Small queues, everyone is panicked. With basic hygiene you’ll be ok and you will be able to take advantage 2. Social distancing started in all schools. Threat level went Orange (one level below red )3. Community spread is kicking off 4. Growth rate is around 10% a day. 5. If I were you, I’d be avoiding hawker centres. Eat higher end so you can ensure better hygiene standard You know the risks. Come, enjoy, but without being as carefree as you would love to be."
Exactly agree with the point of Hawker centres where there is no hot water washing of utensils and the same cloth is Used to wash multiple tables. The risk for me has never been worth it.
"Question: how are things here now? My answer: still totally normal. I've been out all day, yes in Singapore, and if I didn't know what I know from the news, I'd have no way of guessing.Hawker centres: fair point in this day and age, but in general without major health alerts, avoiding them is depriving yourself of a big part of local culture and in my eyes makes a trip to Singapore rather pointless. Btw they are quite checked in terms of safety, but of course not as spot on as restaurants. But I guess right now it's true that they might be a bit less safe. When I walk past them they don't look any less busy than usual though.To reiterate: the situation is evolving and the underlying risk is there, but there are no dead bodies on the street and most things work as normal or with heightened precautions (schools were mentioned earlier). The number of cases is officially still pretty low if you think about it, but obviously that could change really quickly. I truly hope it doesn't, but I also really don't know."
"Dear Mmmm19, echo that. Want this to be over and to return to amazing and fun Singapore life without this worry. Hope it’s soon!!"
"Marina Bay Sands announces some closure until further notice, including light show and water showEdited: 8:29 am, February 08, 2020 "
"As predicted, social distancing introduced in schools earlier already in effect in public gatherings. From tourism perspective if, day, Universal were to shut down - that’s a major statement. Let’s hope Not!Edited: 12:32 pm, February 08, 2020 "
"Another 7 more cases today, and 2 from unknown clusters. Think we are nearing to USS closure probably soon."
It’s Iconic. Closing it down would impact morale and lead to increased hysteria.
"Following the Singapore government’s announcement (Feb. 7) to raise its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange, ride-hailing app Grab has decided to stop its ride-sharing option temporarily."
"Any idea if the pool is still open? We are going to gardens by the bay soon, will stick our masks on. Have no symptoms of coronavirus but got the s**ts due to something I ate or water I drank hopefully it clears up today! Its a case of travellers diarreah according to google"
"Hi TravelAddict, don't worry, that's not a symptom on the virus.You really don't need masks at GBTB, you won't be in close proximity to other people for any length of time, and it seems difficult to catch the virus without being in contact with an infected person for some time.Also both Singapore and the UK stress wearing masks does not give much protection, it's more important to keep your hands clean by washing them carefully for 30 seconds whenever practical, make sure you rub over all parts of your hands."
"Cheers, will do just that"
"Hi TravelAddict, it probably is traveller’s diarrhoea and nothing to worry about. I just want to highlight the symptoms do not totally preclude coronavirus as a small number of cases can present non-classical symptoms like vomiting and diarrhoea."

That article is basically speculation as they don’t have sufficient data to indicate what it would be either way.
