People acting like this is Ebola.
Unfortunately his behavior affected tens of thousands of other people. There is a poster here who repeatedly claims that this is unwarranted panic.
"It was right here all along (post 104) :^D https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60713…No informed person is saying this is like Ebola, but a whole freakin' lot of people have gotten sick, at least 126,200 all over the world, and who knows how many were unaware they were infected but may have infected others. As of now, more than 4600 people around the world have died. https:/…locations-confirmed-cases.htmlEven Trump, who up to now has kept saying this was just another kind of flu and would go away, has pulled his head out and apparently begun to pay attention to medical expertise and take decisive action, hopefully in time to have a positive effect. He keeps calling this a ""foreign virus,"" as if the germ were the “fault” of China or Korea or Italy or some other less civilized, advanced, and enlightened place than America, but that doesn't matter anymore. In the world we live in, with so much travel and trade, there is no such thing as a ""foreign virus"" – a virus anywhere has the capability of going everywhere; and he is now trying to catch up with it before it does more damage.Edited: 5:01 am, March 12, 2020 "
