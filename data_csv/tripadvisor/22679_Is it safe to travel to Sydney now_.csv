"Hi guysss, I am travelling first time to Australia from Jakarta next month with my mom, my pregnant wife and my 18months daughther. We are very concerned with the ongoing coronavirus issue. Is it safe to travel to Sydney now? Should we cancel our trip? What's your advice here?Edited: 1:06 am, February 05, 2020 "
"Unbelievable. There have been 4 cases (2 recovered) in Sydney, a city of about 5 million people. Personally I would be more worried about picking up something nasty in Jakarta than Sydney."
You’re more likely to catch coronavirus at home than in Australia.
"Dear OP, as others have said, there are very few cases of coronavirus in Australia. They have all been identified and treated. There has been no deaths in Australia resulted from that virus. However, the situation is still developing globally and what I am more concerned about are travel bans and restrictions. Flights and ships have been quarantined just on the suspicion of someone being a carrier onboard. This has little to do with the overall situation in the entire country but of individuals who might be thrown together by the randomness of connecting flights. If that concerns you then you need to weight the pros and cons of your trip. Not so much about the virus in Australia but secondary issues that might impact on your travels."
"Yeah, strange that. All other countries in the region have reported infections, but not Indonesia."
I think you should be more concerned about drop bears
Lol. Thank you guys for the inputs - very true. We are pretty worried here as well with the fact that there is no reported case at all.I am reconsidering on the trip. I am not concerned about the situation there but I am concerned about the airport situation.
What is it about the airport that concerns you?
"A lot of people from all over the world gather in one place? Also, the risk being in the plane."
"Perhaps it would be better if you postponed it.You are concerned for your family, and that is fair enough. I don't mean this sarcastically- if you get worried about any sniffle one of your family gets, it will spoil your time, and if you were (very) unlucky enough to catch something, you will be wishing you'd taken your own advice. Sydney won't go away- if you have serious concerns (and with your pregnant wife and a toddler, I can understand why you want to be careful) then come over another time, when you feel happier about it."
And according to some Pommie scandal sheet...the Daily Mail...Sydney streets are deserted and empty anyway...Was in the paper...must be true
I know where all those people who aren't in the streets are: they're slowing down my getting my lunch by hiding / queuing in Australia Square!
"LoL, my local shopping centre was busy as and not a mask to be seen. I won't mind if some of them decide to hide at home for a bit. ;)"
"I agree with Centralvic’s comment. If I was a travel party that included an elderly person, pregnant person a toddler, I think I would be postponing, keeping clear of crowds and watching how this situation develops. Travel when you feel confident"
You're more likely to get the flu like people have been getting better a thousand years.
"Thank you guys for the input. It is very true and since I'm traveling with an infant, a pregnant woman and an elderly, I have decided to cancel the trip. Better safe than sorry."
"Give it a few months, things should settle down. We will stay be here and you can plan for a new trip."
"Hi,We traveled from Bangkok to Sydney on February 12, 2020. It is safe in Sydney regarding the virus. We stayed in Chinatown. Sydney is nice and safe. We are tourists.Edited: 3:12 pm, February 13, 2020 "
The last known coronavirus patient in Sydney has recovered and discharged from hospital yesterday. There are no known cases in the wild in Sydney at the moment.
