"Hello,Travel restriction permitting we are looking at the following:- Miami - 3 nights- Key West - 2 nightsFlight to CharlestonThen we’d like to visit the following but timings aren’t certain:- Charleston- Savannah- final stop will be New Orleans.How long should we spend in each of these?Is it worth doing both Charleston and Savannah?Should we visit other places?We’d get a car in Savannah and drive from there towards New Orleans.Thanks in advance."
When is this trip? Summer humidity can make these cities brutally hot for someone not used to that - folks there just move from one air conditioned area to another.
"Sorry, should have included this in the original post. August providing we are allowed to travel."
"Well, August will be pretty hot and humid. It’s also in Hurricane season but let’s not get too concerned about that.........you do get some notice!How long do you have overall? It’s possible to drive from Savannah to NOLA in a long ( pretty boring if you ask me) day along I-10, or you can take a few days along the Gulf Coast.Lots of people get enough of both Charleston and Savannah in a couple of days, even just one full day fur Savannah as it’s pretty compact. NOLA wants about 3-4 nights."
"You could also take an inland route, with nature and history but timescale, you must have a window in mind?"
"I have no crystal ball that's any better than yours, but I personally really would not get your hopes up about being able to do this trip this August.I certainly, in your shoes, would first check what my travel insurance covers carefully before booking a single thing, and then making sure absolutely everything is cancellable, even if it cost me more.Yes, how long do you have?Have you visited the USA before? What is your travel style? How active do you like to be in cities? Why have you chosen those destination for the hottest period of summer?The driving, apart from down to the Keys, will not be particularly scenic, and while I love most of the cities mentioned, and have a greater tolerance/enjoyment of them than Valiant's does, exploring them in August heat can be heavy going.Is somewhere worth visiting and how long you need very much depends on what you want of those cities. Why did you pick them?For example, we had over a week in New Orleans and could have done with more, but it was not a continuous week, it was split as it book ended a long road trip so we saw the city in contrasting circumstances and stayed in different areas.SWT"
Plan in doing it in early November. Weather would be better.August is very hot and humid and high Hurricane risk.How much time do you have?
