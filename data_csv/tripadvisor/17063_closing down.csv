good news the bahia principe san juan closing next week for two to three months due to the epidemic
The closure is NOW due to a fire the other day that destroyed part of the resort. What started the fire is currently unknown and under investigation.
Hi I am due to go to Bahia principe in sept for two weeks. Further to your report that the hotel will be closed for 3 months i was just wondering where you got this information from? i have searched for ages on the internet but can not find anything saying the hotel will not reopen for a couple of month.ThanksAmy 
An article written in Spanish was posted at Debbie's Dominican Republic Forum describing the fire. It apparently wiped out the reception area of the resort. debsdrtravels.proboards47.com/index.cgiâ€¦
we are due to be staying at the bahia principle from aug 28th for 2/52. we have not been made aware of any closure to the hotel as yet. we have been told by the travel company that they will not be able to accommodate us (11 people) elsewhere in the DR should they not send people to the bahia!! any further information on this closure would be appreciated as the travel company are not communicating with us. 
Yes it did burn down I have just posted the article from the Dominican Today newspaper. You may read the whole article.
"Rjb5, if your travel company wont contact you or refuse to send you elsewhere then i suggest you look at the legal side, maybe talk to citizens advice, solicitor etc. They are being totally unreasonable, all other companies can manage to move people so they should be able to!!!!! Hope you sort it out"
"CrazyND the entire hotel DID NOT burn down, one part of it did. As you enter the complex, they have a convention and event area for people that are there for meetings etc and this is the part of the hotel that burned down, NOT the entire resort. The area of the hotel that houses the reception, guest rooms and restaurants are all intact. The hotel was scheduled to close for a couple of weeks to eradicate a gastro virus that was brought to the resort by tourists."
"I have only heard rumours that the hotel is closing, but then I was told 2 weeks ago by a member of staff at First Choice that it had been emptied and was being sanitised. That was a big fat lie as a week later (last wed) another member of staff corrected me when I brought this up to them that it was never emptied but sick people there were being quarantined. That was a big fat lie also. Any how whether the hotel is closed now or not, my travel agent First Choice have phoned and moved me from Bahia principle because of Health and safety. "
They should have closed this place down a long time ago. Not because of a fire or an epidemic. 
"The hotel did not burn down nor were the rooms or restaurants compromised. We were there when the fire broke out last Thurs.(we left Friday the 17th). And they are not closing the resort due to the fire. I'm not sure what folks are reading but that is completely untrue. The fire was in the convention ctr. at the very entrance of the resort. I will post the photos soon. The fact is, they are closing to the virus that hit, and yes we were there in the midst of that as well. They will be closed for 45 days+. And they will also be finishing renovations that had been started prior to its closing."
"The reception area burned down?!? Its funny how rumors get started and make the situation (the fire, that is) worse than it actually was. For the folks who have been there no that the conv. ctr is nowhere near the reception."
"Curiousnewyorker, did you have a good time whilst you were there?i hope recent events at the hotel didnt spoil it for you"
"Hi Sunsees,We had a great time the first week. We then started getting some symptoms, like some stomach cramping and loss of appetite but never anything as severe as the other folks. As soon as we started getting symptons, we went to the hotel doctor immediately and received medications. My husband and I 'roll with the punches' so we kept a positive attitude thru the whole thing and still managed to have good time. It was sad to see such a great resort go thru something like this. And I felt really bad for the folks that got really sick.But it will not deter us from returning. Going again in Jan.!!Iris"
"Thats good that you had great time, even though you got stomach cramps. It is sad to see resorts go through these things and that people get sick, but i feel you have a great attitude, keeping positive is a good thing to do, and not letting things deter you is great!!!! Hope you have good time in Jan :-)"
