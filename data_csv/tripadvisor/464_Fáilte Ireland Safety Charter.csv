"Back in the sixties, ""Safety Fast"" was the essence of MG"
"Potential customers can read the protocols on the Failte Ireland site listed under Guidelines for reopening and this may reassure them that the providers of the resource have some understanding of the safety measures that need to be adhered to.The rest is up to the customer...wash your hands frequently, use the sanitiser provided by the premises and be careful about social distancing...and then enjoy the holiday"
"I don’t see how we can relax and enjoy the holidays when people travelling from the U.K. and US will be using these same establishments. Failte Ireland can’t have it both ways imo.Edited: 7:07 am, July 10, 2020 "

"It is a joke, NI have relaxed quarantining and we will have many more via that route as well. There is effectively no quarantining as I stated in a different thread but I was slated because some oracles feel it wasn't in keeping with the spirit of the thread. It seems it just depends on who raises an issue as to whether it is deemed off-topic or not. The government have given in to the lobby groups. The R value has exceeded one now and a lot of it is happening as a result of travelling. How did people think we wouldn't get clowns like those two Americans travelling here? We need testing at the airport and to be held at local hotels (at their own expense) until their test results come back."
I could kick myself now for my last post. I asked for it to be deleted before this thread spirals beyond the topic issue.

"Safety training won't protect patrons from our American and other friends arriving in Dublin every day. If they are irresponsible enough to travel they certainly won't abide by hotel rules and regulations. Like Bríd I won't be staying in any hotels in Ireland for the forseeable future.Edited: 11:41 am, July 11, 2020 "

"Sissy, it's best to ignore OR's posts. Sorry, this is advice I don't follow myself..."
"I stated American AND other friends, i.e. all irresponsible people arriving in this country...particularly from the US as there were Americans interviewed by the media downplaying the pandemic even though they come from virus hotspots. Once again many people referred to Americans in these threads but our regulars only isolate my posts for scrutiny...the pattern is very obvious. For some ridiculous Europe banned incoming flights from America but we didn't. There is a very good reason why Europe has banned these flights...it is to do with the way the virus has been handled there.Edited: 4:32 pm, July 11, 2020 "
"OffalyRover, one of these days you and I are going to sit down and have a pint and a chat and have it out. Are you on?"
"I am not interested in having anything out with anyone, especially people who have posts removed in a cowardly fashion and tell others to ignore my posts as if they weren't capable of deciding for themselves. Forums of any nature are about different opinions, experiences and perspectives - many contributors on here either don't get (or want to accept )that. The majority of regulars here share the same perspectives as well as tolerating off-topic chat amongst each other followed by back-slapping. As soon as someone strays from the general narrative the cowardly act of banding together and reporting posts happens. In some cases they refer to someone who would dare stray from the back-slapping narrative as a troll. What I stated about American tourists was referred to by other regulars also but their contributions were tolerated. This issue has been well reported in the media and on here and I stand over everything I said. Most of Europe has banned flights from America because of how badly Trump has handled the situation over there. Americans who fly here during a pandemic are likely Trump voters and tens of millions of Americans voted for him in the last election. This has nothing to do with anti-American sentiment, it is to do with behaviour and public health awareness."
